Facebook on Monday introduced the first open-source multi-lingual machine translation model M2M-100 that can translate between any pair of 100 languages without relying on English data.

When translating, previous models made use of English translation data as it was widely available. Facebook's model translates directly from language one to another to preserve meaning better, the company said in a statement.

The programme outperforms English-centric systems by 10 points on the BLEU metric, which is used for evaluating machine translations.

M2M-100 is trained on a total of 2,200 language directions. It will improve the quality of translations for billions of people, especially those who speak low-resource languages, it added.

Typical translation systems require building separate AI models for each language and task, but this approach doesn’t scale effectively on Facebook, where people post content in more than 160 languages across billions of posts. Advanced multilingual systems can process multiple languages at once, but compromise on accuracy by relying on English data to bridge the gap between the source and target languages.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Adobe on Tuesday unveiled its content attribution tool for Photoshop, designed to tackle deepfakes and misleading content.

The tool is part of Adobe’s Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) that was launched last year, and is developed with an open standard to offer a secure layer of “tamper-evident” attribution data to photos.

“The more creators distribute content with proper attribution, the more consumers will expect and use that information to make judgement calls, thus minimizing the influence of bad actors and deceptive content,” Adobe said in a blog post.

The attribution tool captures cryptographically verifiable data such as information about the creator of an image, when the image was created, and how it was created.

Creators will be able to access and change attribution data under the content authenticity panel in Photoshop. They can choose to add all data or selectively attach data like thumbnail information, produced by, details about edits and activity, and assets used, depending on their content.

Adobe says CAI will impact photojournalism, creative work, and social media sharing. It will help people understand what to trust online, and will also provide credit to creators for their work.

4,2020/10/21,"Microsoft is most mimicked brand to steal personal information, report says","Microsoft accounted for 19% of all brand phishing attempts as threat actors aimed at capitalising on large number of employees working remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Microsoft is the most frequently used brand name by criminals in their attempts to steal individuals’ personal information during July, August and September, according to a report by cybersecurity firm Check Point Research.

Microsoft accounted for 19% of all brand phishing attempts as threat actors aimed at capitalising on large number of employees working remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic, the report noted.

Other brands with a high percentage of phishing attempts include DHL (9%), Google (9%), Paypal (6%) and Netflix (6%).

In terms of sectors mimicked, technology was the most targeted, followed by banking and social network.

During the quarter ending September, email phishing was the most prominent type of brand phishing platform, accounting for 44% of attacks. The top phishing brands exploited by email phishing attacks were Microsoft, DHL and Apple.

While Web phishing, that ranked first in the previous quarter stood at the second place.

A brand phishing attack is when criminals try to imitate the official website of a well-known brand by using a similar domain name or URL and web-page design to the genuine site.

The link to the fake website, which in intended to steal users’ credentials, payment details or other personal information, is then sent to individuals by email or text message.

During mid-August, Check Point researchers noted a malicious phishing email trying to steal credentials of Microsoft accounts by luring victims to click on a malicious link which redirects the user to a fraudulent Microsoft login page.

Similarly, during September, an email which was allegedly sent by Amazon was attempting to steal users’ credit information by directing the user to a fraudulent Amazon billing centre website in which the user was instructed to enter billing information.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/5ilp4o/article32908338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/microsoft-phishing-attacksjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/microsoft-is-most-mimicked-brand-to-steal-personal-information-report-says/article32908293.ece
5,2020/10/21,Digitising ancient maps using AI,"The tool can be helpful to urban planners, historians and anthropologists.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Researchers at University of Pernambuco in Brazil have come up with a new way of transforming ancient maps in to Google satellite images.

Digitisation of maps could inform people of how certain areas have been used and developed over time, including social and economic impacts of urbanisation, the team said in a study titled 'Synthesis of Satellite-Like Urban Images From Historical Maps Using Conditional GAN' published in the IEEE GRSL journal.

The team used an artificial intelligence (AI) tool called Pix2Pix which is based on two neural networks. The first one creates images based on the input set, while the second network decides if the generated image is fake or not. The networks are trained to fool each other, and ultimately create realistic-looking images based on the historical data provided.

The team studied a map of Recife, the capital of Pernambuco state, from 1808 to generate modern day images. The images show how the city has changed in 200 years. The team identified that the city's geography changed drastically - landfills have reduced in size and water bodies and green areas have been removed by human activity.

The advantage of using AI this approach is that it requires relatively little input volume.

6,2020/10/21,Google Antitrust lawsuit: All you need to know,"The U.S. Justice Department accused Google of partnering with Apple, and other companies, to ward off competition by striking exclusive business contracts with them.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday sued Google, claiming the company illegally maintained monopoly over search and search-related activities.

In one of the biggest lawsuits against a tech company in over two decades, the legal department accused Google of partnering with Apple, and other companies, to ward off competition by striking exclusive business contracts with them.

What is the Justice Department’s claim?

The Justice department claimed Google’s 80% market share in search engine business was made possible by the deals it struck with smartphone makers, which helped it put its search service as default for users.

The department further said Google spent billions of dollars from its advertising revenue to pay for mobile manufacturers, carriers and browsers to make Google as their pre-set search engine.

This meant that Google held top position in search of millions of devices, making it difficult for other search engines to establish themselves.

The lawsuit accused Apple and Google of being reliant on each other, and edging out rivals from the market. The department noted that almost half of Google’s search traffic in 2019 came from Apple’s devices, while about a fifth of Apple’s annual profit came from Google.

The complaint also alleged Google of restraining innovation, reducing choice and degrading the service quality such as privacy data.

“Google has used anticompetitive tactics to maintain and extend its monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising-the cornerstone of its empire,” the lawsuit read.

The lawsuit has been filed amid a wider questioning of big tech companies’ dominance, and comes after more than an year of investigation by the Justice Department. Albeit the agency has not suggested any remedies.

The Justice Department also investigated other areas including web display and video ads, and spoke to Google’s rivals in technology and media to collect documents in order to build a case.

However, the case related to search seems to be the strongest where the agency needs to show that Google is dominant in the search and its deals with smart phone makers have dented the competition in the market.

Other states and jurisdictions are also expected to file separate complaints against the company.

What is Google’s defence?

Google’s chief legal officer Kent Walker called the lawsuit ‘deeply flawed’.

“People use Google because they choose to, not because they’re forced to or because they can’t find alternatives,” he said in a statement on Tuesday.

He added that the lawsuit would, in turn, harm the consumers as it would artificially prop-up lower quality search alternatives and raise phone prices.

He argued that the company pays to promote its business with Apple, other phone manufacturers and carriers to grab the eye-level shelf space on their devices, and that there was nothing wrong in doing so.

“But let’s be clear- our competitors are readily available too, if you want to use them,” Walker added.

Walker noted that the American antitrust law is not designed to tilt the playing field in favour of particular competitor and Google believes the Court will conclude that the suit doesn’t square with either the facts or the law.

Google’s defence stems from the fact that its services are offered to customers with little or no cost, eliminating the potential price harm in the antitrust argument.

Expected Outcome of the case

It is unlikely that the tech giant would refrain from a legal fight as it has fought similar antitrust lawsuits in Europe.

A loss for the Mountain-view based company could revamp one of the biggest tech firms that helped revolutionise the internet, while a win could lead to a huge blow in overall scrutiny of big tech companies.

Such cases run for years and the new government formed after November 3 elections will have to bear the responsibility of managing the suit. The lawsuit will also be a test for antitrust laws as Democrats have long argued that the regulations need to be adjusted according to the current digital era.

At least 25 Afghan security force personnel were killed in an ambush blamed on the Taliban, officials said on Wednesday, as spiralling violence imperils ongoing peace talks.

The ambush came despite Taliban assurances to Washington last week that they would reduce bloodshed.

Security forces were attacked overnight Tuesday in Takhar province and fighting was ongoing, said Jawad Hejri, a spokesman for the governor, who put the death toll so far at 25.

“The Taliban had taken positions in the houses around the area. They ambushed our forces who were there for an operation against the enemy,” he said.

Takhar provincial health director Abdul Qayoum said 34 security personnel had been killed — including the deputy police chief of the province.

The Taliban did not directly take responsibility, but said their fighters had “engaged the enemy” in Takhar to retaliate against security operations carried out against them.

Despite joining peace talks with the Afghan government in Qatar last month, the Taliban have only increased violence in Afghanistan in a bid to wield leverage in the negotiations.

The Lagos State Governor said 30 people were hurt in the shooting during a demonstration at a toll gate in the Lekki district, a focal point of nearly two weeks of nationwide protests against allegations of systematic police brutality.

As President Muhammadu Buhari appealed for “understanding and calm”, Amnesty International said it was investigating “credible but disturbing evidence of excessive use of force occasioning deaths of protesters” at the toll gate.

Four witnesses said soldiers had fired bullets and at least two people had been shot. Two of the witnesses said the gate’s lights were turned before the shooting began. One said he saw soldiers remove bodies.

In a Twitter post, the Nigerian Army said no soldiers were at the scene.

The letter says strengthening the Quad — the group comprising India, the U.S., Australia and Japan — has become especially important in the face of China’s “rising military and economic assertiveness”.

“We write in strong support of India’s decision to formally invite Australia to participate in the annual Exercise Malabar, which was made following the recent 2+2 ministerial meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue [the Quad] in Tokyo,” the Senators wrote.

India’s invitation to Australia to join this year’s exercise comes three years after Canberra had asked to join the programme.

The Senators’ letter called Australia a “uniquely capable and stalwart partner,” saying its addition to the Malabar exercise would provide increased interoperability, strengthen threat assessment abilities and enhance “the maritime roles and missions of the four naval powers”.

“However, of equal importance is the symbolic nature of Australia’s inclusion in Malabar, marking the first time that the United States, India, Japan and Australia will engage collectively at the military level since the formation of the Quad and the Quad-plus-Singapore naval exercises held in September 2007,” the Senators wrote.

“In the face of China’s rising military and economic assertiveness, strengthening of the Quad has become increasingly important. As the world addresses the fallout caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, China has opportunistically looked to expand its military footprint across the Indo-Pacific. From the South China Sea to the Himalayas, Beijing continues to use methods of intimidation and territorial aggression to test the resolve of regional actors,” the letter says.

The pandemic has exacerbated concerns about China’s BRI and debt-trap diplomacy as per the Senators’ letter, which calls for increased collaboration among Quad partners on infrastructure financing.

“For instance, the Blue Dot Network (BDN), launched in 2019 by the U.S., Japan and Australia, is an initiative that will bring together governments, the private sector and civil society to certify projects that uphold global infrastructure principles. Given that three Quad partners are already involved in BDN, we encourage India’s participation in this promising initiative,” the Senators wrote.

Signatories of the letter include co–chairs of the Senate India Caucus John Cornyn (Republican, Texas) and Mark Warner (Democrat, Virgina). The list also includes — as one of the lead signatories — David Perdue of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Mr. Perdue was in the news recently for mocking Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris’s first name, which is of Indian (Sanskrit). Mr. Perdue faces re-election for his Senate seat in Georgia.

16,2020/10/21,Pakistan warns of new lockdown as COVID-19 mortality rate increases by 140%,"“Strict punitive actions on SOP violations will be initiated,” an official statement from NCOC said, adding that wearing of face masks and social-distancing must be ensured.

Pakistan’s top body, which oversees response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, on Wednesday warned that strict measures, including lockdown, could be initiated to contain the infection if people don’t stop violating government guidelines, as the country’s COVID-19 mortality rate increased by 140% compared to past few weeks.

“The National Command and Operations Centre (NCOC) is closely monitoring the situation. If there is no improvement in SOPs compliance observed, NCOC will have no choice but to revert to strict measures leading to re-closures of services,” the Body said in a statement on Wednesday.

During a special session of the NCOC to monitor an increase in cases, the Body led by Minister for Planning Asad Umar was informed that there is a clear resurgence of the virus while deaths are also increasing. All Chief Secretaries were directed to “strictly implement” Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Geo TV reported, citing the statement.

“Strict punitive actions on SOP violations will be initiated,” it said, adding that wearing of face masks and social-distancing must be ensured. At least 19 people have died of coronavirus in Pakistan in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 6,692.

The NCOC statement comes a day after Mr. Umar said that the COVID-19 mortality rate in Pakistan has increased by 140% in the last week and warned the public against ignoring the safety protocols.

“Last week daily COVID mortality was 12. This is a 140% increase vs few weeks back. We are collectively committing a blunder by recklessly ignoring all SoPs & the results have started to show. If we do not change our current path we will lose both lives and livelihoods, he tweeted on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, the Cabinet has expressed serious concern over the increase in coronavirus cases in the country and asked people to take necessary precautions against the expected second wave of the pandemic.

Radio Pakistan reported that a Cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan in Islamabad was informed about the rise in the number of new cases in October as compared to the figures of July and August. It was pointed out that the COVID-19 positivity rate has risen to 2%, while the number of deaths has also gone up.

Positivity rate is the percentage of positive results out of the total number of tests sampled. The Ministry of National Health Services said that the total number of COVID-19 cases has risen to 324,744 after 660 new infections were reported in the last 24 hours.

So far, 308,674 people have fully recovered from the disease, while some 559 are in critical condition, according to the Ministry.

Sindh has reported 142,348 cases, Punjab 101,936, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 38,779, Islamabad 18,309, Balochistan 15,717, Gilgit-Baltistan 4,091 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 3,564 cases. The authorities have performed 26,670 tests in the last 24 hours, taking the number of total tests conducted in the country to 4,148,739.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/e900s2/article32909728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21IN-KARACHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-warns-of-new-lockdown-as-covid-19-mortality-rate-increases-by-140/article32909729.ece
17,2020/10/21,Pope Francis reverts to mask-less old ways at indoor audience,"Pope Francis shunned a face mask again during his Wednesday general audience in the Vatican auditorium, and didn’t wear one when he greeted a half-dozen mask-less bishops at the end.

A day after donning a face mask for the first time during a liturgical service, Pope Francis was back to his mask-less old ways on Wednesday despite surging coronavirus (COVID-19) infections across Europe.

Pope shunned a face mask again during his Wednesday general audience in the Vatican auditorium, and didn’t wear one when he greeted a half-dozen mask-less bishops at the end. He shook hands and leaned in to chat privately with each one.

While the clerics wore masks while seated during the audience, all but one took his mask off to speak to the Pope. Only one kept it on, and by the end of his tete-a-tete with the Pope, had lowered it under his chin.

Vatican regulations now require facemasks to be worn indoors and out where distancing can’t be always guaranteed. The Vatican hasn’t responded to questions about why the Pope wasn’t following either Vatican regulations or basic public health measures to prevent COVID-19.

Pope explained to the audience why he didn’t plunge into the crowd at the start of the audience as he usually would do. But he said his distance from them was for their own well-being, to prevent crowds from forming around him.

I’m sorry for this, but it’s for your own safety,” he said. Rather than get close to you, shake your hands and greet you, I greet you from far away. But know that I’m close to you with my heart.”

He did not address his decision to forego wearing a mask. Pope did, however, wear a white face mask throughout an inter-religious prayer service in downtown Rome on Tuesday, removing it only to speak. He had previously only been seen wearing one once before as he entered and exited his car in a Vatican courtyard on September 9. Italian law requires masks indoors and out.

At 83 and with part of a lung removed when he was in his 20s due to illness, Pope would be at high risk for COVID-19 complications. He has urged the faithful to comply with government mandates to protect public health. In the past week, 11 Swiss Guards and a resident of the hotel where Pope lives have tested positive.

In Italy, coronavirus cases are surging, with the Lazio region around Vatican City among the hardest hit. Lazio has more people hospitalised and in intensive care than any other region except Italy’s most populous and hardest-hit region, Lombardy.

Inside the Vatican auditorium on Wednesday, the crowd wore masks as did the Swiss Guards. But Pope and his two aides did not.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4fi6ol/article32908939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21INPOPE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pope-reverts-to-mask-less-old-ways-at-indoor-audience/article32908940.ece
18,2020/10/21,"EU to U.K. on Brexit talks: ‘You can’t have cake, eat it too’","Britain and the EU have been attempting to strike a new trade deal since the U.K. left the bloc on January 31

The European Union took a defiant tone on October 21 as the standoff over resuming post-Brexit trade negotiations with the United Kingdom intensified, telling London that you cannot have your cake and eat it too.

Also read: U.K., EU to discuss 'structure' of Brexit talks

European Council President Charles Michel refused to bow to British insistence for the EU to fundamentally change its negotiating stance and cede more to U.K. demands. Michel said instead that if Britain wants vast access to the 27-member bloc’s markets, it will equally have to keep its waters open to EU fishermen, something the U.K. government has said it doesn’t want to do.

In a combative display at the European Parliament, Mr. Michel said, “Yes, we want to keep access to U.K. waters for our fishermen. Exactly like the U.K., too, want to keep access to our huge and diversified markets for its companies.”

Britain and the EU have been attempting to strike a new trade deal since the U.K. left the bloc on Jan. 31.

Those talks ground to a halt last week, with each side calling for the other to compromise in order to secure a deal. The EU said it was happy to keep talking, but Mr. Johnson said on Friday that negotiations were over unless there was a fundamental shift from the bloc.

Since then, the EU has agreed to intensify talks — a key U.K. demand — and to discuss the legal text of an agreement. But Mr. Johnson’s Downing Street office said on Tuesday that it wasn’t a big enough change to resume negotiations.

We will also remain firm: Michel Barner

EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier played down the chance of ground-shaking change after all these months when talks on key issues moved at a glacial pace.

“May I remind you that the European Union’s attitude in this negotiation has in no way shifted and it will not shift,” Mr. Barnier told EU legislators.

“We will also remain firm and determined when it comes to defending the principles and the interests of each of the EU member states.” But he also said there would need to be compromises on both sides — an olive branch to Britain, which complains it’s being asked to make all the concessions.

Mr. Barnier has said he is willing to return to London as soon as the British want to host him again, especially since the deadline is drawing ever closer. Any trade deal needs to go through legal vetting and legislative approval before Jan. 1, so it makes the real deadline for a deal closer to the first week of November instead of New Year’s Eve.

EU officials have said such time pressure made the U.K. decision to delay further talks even more baffling.

The bloc accuses Britain of seeking the kind of unfettered access to its markets usually reserved for EU members.

“The U.K. wants access to a single market while at the same time being able to diverge from our standards and regulations when it suits them,” Mr. Michel said. “You can’t have your cake and eat it too.”

Internal Market Bill

EU leaders also remain angry over the U.K.’s plans to disregard some parts of the legally binding withdrawal agreement it signed with the bloc.

If passed, the Internal Market Bill will allow the British government to override parts of the legally binding Brexit withdrawal agreement relating to trade with Northern Ireland, the only part of the U.K. to share a border with the EU.

Mr. Johnson’s government says it needs the legislation as an insurance policy in case the EU behaves unreasonably after a post-Brexit transition period ends on Dec. 31 and tries to impede the flow of goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.

The bloc sees it as a flagrant breach of an international treaty that could undermine the delicate foundations of Northern Ireland’s peace settlement, created by the 1998 Good Friday accord.

It further feeds a general sense of mistrust of Britain, and complicates any trade deal since the EU will look at every single, tiniest paragraph to make sure the U.K. will be respecting it.

Mr. Michel used it to highlight the need to respect high environmental and social commitments in any trade deal.

“Our U.K. friends say they want to maintain the highest standards. If that’s the case, why don’t they commit to them? We don’t need words. We need guarantees,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/klp2d3/article32908870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-BREXIT-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eu-to-uk-on-brexit-talks-you-cant-have-cake-eat-it-too/article32908871.ece
19,2020/10/21,Australian watchdog considers its own Google antitrust case,"“I’m delighted the D.o.J.’s taking it on and we’ll follow it really closely.”

Australia’s competition watchdog will consider its own antitrust case against Google, the commission chairman said Wednesday after the U.S. Justice Department sued the company for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising.

Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Rod Sims described the U.S. case filed Tuesday as one of the world’s biggest antitrust cases in the past 20 years.

“I’m delighted the D.o.J.’s taking it on and we’ll follow it really closely,” Mr. Sims told the National Press Club, referring to the U.S. Department of Justice.

“We’re going to look at it and see whether there’s any value in what we might do,” Mr. Sims added.

Separately, Mr. Sims is drafting legislation to address the imbalance in bargaining power between Google and the Australian media businesses that want the tech giant to pay for journalism.

The bills, that will be ready to be introduced to Parliament by December, would empower an arbitrator to make binding decisions on how much Google and Facebook must pay media companies for news content.

Mr. Sims said his commission had a lot of talk with the U.S. Justice Department before he released a report in July last year that recommended more government regulation on the market power of Google and Facebook that would ensure fair deals for other media businesses and more control for individuals on how their data was used.

Mr. Sims’s commission launched Australian court action against Google in July alleging the California-based company misled account holders about its use of their personal data.

The commission alleges the Google misled millions of Australians to obtain their consent and expand the scope of personal information that Google collects about users’ internet activity to target advertising. Google denies the allegations.

In October last year, the commission sued Google in an Australian court alleging the company broke consumer law by misleading Android users about how their location data was collected and used. That case will be heard by the Federal Court next month. Google also denies that allegation.

Mr. Sims said Google was lobbying every politician at Parliament House ahead of draft legislation being introduced to make it pay for news.

Google has said the proposed laws would result in dramatically worse Google Search and YouTube, put free services at risk and could lead to users’ data being handed over to big news businesses. Facebook has warned it might block Australian news content rather than pay for it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gwetmh/article32907583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIAGOOGLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australian-watchdog-considers-its-own-google-antitrust-case/article32907584.ece

At least 15 people were killed in stampede among thousands of Afghans gathered near Pakistan's consulate on Tuesday as jostling broke out between people applying for visas, officials in the eastern city of Jalalabad said.

An estimated 3,000 Afghans had congregated on the open ground, usually used for sports or pubic gatherings, outside the consulate, waiting to collect tokens needed to apply for a visa, two provincial officials told Reuters a day after the tragedy.

An Afghan news channel transmitted images of them holding passports aloft to secure a token. Images taken after the stampede showed scores of passports strewn across the ground.

“The visa applicants jostled to secure their token from the consulate officials...the crowd got out of control, leading to a stampede,” said an Afghan official.

A survivor described to Reuters how tempers frayed and the crowd became unruly in the lead up to the stampede.

“I stood in the queue all night but at some point people got angry and started pushing, many of us fell on the ground,” said Farmanullah, who goes by a single name.

Eleven of the 15 victims were women, and several senior citizens were among more than a dozen injured, Sohrab Qaderi, a provincial council member, said. Tens of thousands of Afghans every year travel to neighbouring Pakistan to secure medical treatment, education and jobs. The two countries share a nearly 2,600-kilometre border.

Pakistan hosts about 3 million Afghan refugees and economic migrants, who have fled violence, religious persecution and poverty in their war-torn country.

A powerful explosion ripped through a four-storey building in Pakistan’s Sindh province, killing at least five people and injuring 20 others, police said.

At least two floors of the building near Maskan Chowrangi in the Gulshan-e-Iqbal area in Karachi were severely damaged, leading authorities to fear that the toll may rise.

The death toll in the incident has increased to five, Faisal Edhi of the Edhi Ambulance Service said.

Seven of the injured are said to be in critical condition.

The security forces have cordoned off the area after the explosion.

Police chief Mushtaq Mahar said the bomb disposal squad and anti-terrorism officials are yet to determine the cause of the explosion.

A police official said that initial investigations suggested that the explosion could have been caused due to a gas leak.

The official said that no trace of an improvised explosive device (IED) was found at the scene.

The incident happened a day after five people were injured when an IED bomb exploded at the entrance of a bus terminal in the Shireen Jinnah colony area of the city.

Media reports said that the explosion was so powerful that it shattered the windows of nearby buildings and also damaged vehicles.

22,2020/10/21,"One in six children living in extreme poverty, figure set to rise during pandemic: UN","“One in six children living in extreme poverty is one in six children struggling to survive.”

An estimated one in six children — or 356 million globally — were living in extreme poverty before the COVID-19 pandemic began, and this is set to worsen significantly, according to a new World Bank Group and UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) analysis.

‘Global Estimate of Children in Monetary Poverty: An Update’, notes that sub-Saharan Africa, with its limited social safety nets, accounts for two-thirds of children living in households that struggle to survive on an average of $1.90 a day or less per person — the international measure for extreme poverty, while South Asia accounts for nearly a fifth of these children.

The analysis shows that the number of children living in extreme poverty decreased moderately, by 29 million, between 2013 and 2017. However, UNICEF and the World Bank Group warn that any progress made in recent years, has been “slow-paced, unequally distributed, and at risk” due to the economic impact of the pandemic.

“One in six children living in extreme poverty is one in six children struggling to survive,” UNICEF Director of Programmes Sanjay Wijesekera said.

“These numbers alone should shock anyone. And the scale and depth of what we know about the financial hardships brought on by the pandemic, are only set to make matters far worse. Governments urgently need a children’s recovery plan to prevent countless more children and their families from reaching levels of poverty unseen for many, many years,” Mr. Wijesekera said.

Although children make up around a third of the global population, around half of the extreme poor are children. Furthermore, they are more than twice as likely to be extremely poor as adults.

The youngest children are the worst off — nearly 20% of all of them below the age of 5 in the developing world live in extremely poor households, the report highlights.

“The fact that one in six children were living in extreme poverty and that 50% of the global extreme poor were children, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, is of grave concern to us all,” said Carolina Sánchez-Páramo, Global Director of Poverty and Equity for the World Bank.

“Extreme poverty deprives hundreds of millions of children of the opportunity to reach their potential, in terms of physical and cognitive development, and threatens their ability to get good jobs in adulthood.

“In the wake of the massive economic disruption caused by the pandemic, it is more crucial than ever that governments support poor households with children now and rebuild their human capital during the recovery,” the director said.

Extreme poverty among children has not fallen as much as it has for adults, and a larger share of the global poor were children in 2017, compared with the 2013 figure.

All regions of the world experienced varying levels of decline in extreme poverty among children, apart from Sub-Saharan Africa, which saw a 64 million increase in the absolute number of children struggling to survive on $1.90 a day, from 170 million in 2013 to 234 million in 2017.

Child poverty is more prevalent in fragile and conflict-affected countries, where more than 40% of children live in extremely poor households, compared to nearly 15% of children in other countries, the analysis says. It also notes that more than 70% of children in extreme poverty live in a household where the head of the house works in the fields or pastures.

The ongoing COVID-19 crisis will continue to disproportionately impact children, women and girls, threatening to reverse hard-won gains towards gender equality, the report predicts, which great social protection has a crucial role to play to improve coping mechanisms for the poor and vulnerable in both the immediate COVID-19 response as well as the longer-term recovery.

World Bank and UNICEF data suggest that most countries have responded to the crisis by expanding social protection programmes, particularly cash transfers, which provide a platform for longer-term investments in human capital.

However, many of the responses are short-term and not adequate to respond to the size and expected long-term nature of the recovery, says the report.

It is more important than ever for governments to scale up and adjust their social protection systems and programmes to prepare for future shocks, including innovations for financial sustainability; strengthening legal and institutional frameworks; protecting human capital; expanding child and family benefits for the long term; as well as investing in family-friendly policies, such as paid parental leave and quality child care for all, the report underscores.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gm0hp/article32906592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POVERTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/one-in-six-children-living-in-extreme-poverty-figure-set-to-rise-during-pandemic-un/article32906593.ece
23,2020/10/21,Nigeria security forces kill protesters after curfew imposed,"Anger over abuses by the police’s loathed Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) erupted into widespread protests some two weeks ago that drew thousands onto the streets.

Several protesters were killed by Nigerian security forces in Lagos on Tuesday, Amnesty International said, after witnesses reported armed men opened fire on demonstrators defying a curfew order.

“People were killed at the (Lekki) tollgate by security forces,” Amnesty’s Nigeria spokesman Isa Sanusi told AFP, in reference to a key protest site in the city.

He said the rights group was “working on verifying how many”.

Witnesses told AFP that shots were fired at the crowd of over 1,000 peaceful demonstrators to disperse them several hours after the authorities declared an open-ended lockdown in Lagos in the face of spiralling protests.

“We were all sitting down, peacefully, and they shut down the lights and the billboards, everyone started screaming,” a protester called Toye told AFP, asking that her full name not be used.

“They came to us, but I don’t know who it was. They were shooting, and everyone was running for his life.”

Another protester, Innocent, said he was helping to ferry the wounded to nearby hospitals.

“Currently I have two people that I rush in my car, a woman and a guy, who are in very critical conditions,” he said.

“I rushed two people already to hospital. One was shot at the back, and one was shot at the stomach.” .

Scenes of people removing a bullet from someone’s wound and pleading for help were broadcast in a live video by DJ Switch, a popular disc jockey, to 150,000 Instagram viewers.

Earlier defiant protesters at the scene had sung the national anthem and pledged to remain out on the streets despite the stay-at-home order.

Anger over abuses by the police’s loathed Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) erupted into widespread protests some two weeks ago that drew thousands onto the streets.

Lagos state governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu ordered the round-the-clock shutdown in the sprawling economic hub on Tuesday, claiming the protests had “degenerated into a monster” as violence flared in a string of cities.

“Criminals and miscreants are now hiding under the umbrella of these protests to unleash mayhem,” he wrote on Twitter, insisting that only essential workers should stay out on the streets.

“We will not watch and allow anarchy in our dear state.”

As the tone hardened from the authorities, Nigeria’s police chief ordered anti-riot units deployed around the country.

“The force will henceforth exercise the full powers of the law to prevent any further attempt on lives and property of citizens,” a statement said.

‘Sponsored hoodlums’

Up until Tuesday some 18 people had died in the demonstrations as clashes were reported between protesters and assailants wearing civilian clothes.

Rights groups and demonstrators have accused “thugs and sponsored hoodlums” of attacking the peaceful rallies and seeking to discredit the protest movement.

Witnesses told AFP that a police station was set ablaze in the Orile Iganmu district of Lagos on Tuesday morning. They said police opened fire on protesters, wounding several.

In the capital Abuja, security forces violently dispersed crowds during the day on Tuesday and thick black smoke could be seen over the city.

Violence spread as well to the largest northern city of Kano as hundreds of people went on a rampage, burning vehicles and looting businesses according to an AFP reporter at the scene.

“The mob came near the school and began assaulting parents who had come to pick up their children,” 35-year old auto mechanic Sadiq Mohammed told AFP.

Police said 12 suspects were also arrested in southern Benin city in connection with separate attacks on two police facilities.

The government announced the scrapping of the SARS unit and a raft of reforms over a week ago, but the bid to placate the protesters has failed.

Officials have called for the demonstrations to be suspended to give the authorities time to make good on their pledges.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v7vfa/article32906586.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0008TH7P8-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nigeria-security-forces-kill-protesters-after-curfew-imposed/article32906562.ece
24,2020/10/21,Germany issues arrest warrants to founders of Panama Papers firm,"The two founders of a Panama-based law firm at the center of a tax haven scandal exposed by the so-called Panama Papers are being sought on international arrest warrants issued by Germany, according to media reports Tuesday.

Munich’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung and broadcasters NDR and WDR reported that German-born Juergen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca are being sought by Cologne prosecutors on charges of accessory to tax evasion and forming a criminal organization.

Cologne prosecutors confirmed to the outlets that they had issued international arrest warrants for two people, but would not give further details and did not pick up their telephones for further comment.

Mr. Fonseca said via Twitter that his firm had sold corporations to a German bank, which had in turn resold them to business people for tax purposes. He said the firm was not involved in those subsequent transactions. “In my opinion, they have included us to continue the discrediting attack of the European Union against Panama,” he wrote.

Panama’s Attorney General’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Panama Papers include a collection of 11 million secret financial documents that illustrated how some of the world’s richest people hide their money. The records were first leaked to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, and were shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which began publishing collaborative reports with news organizations in 2016.

The repercussions of the leaks were far-ranging, prompting the resignation of the prime minister of Iceland and bringing scrutiny to the leaders of Argentina and Ukraine, Chinese politicians and Russian President Vladimir Putin, among others.

U.S. federal prosecutors have alleged that law firm Mossack Fonseca conspired to circumvent American laws to maintain the wealth of its clients and conceal tax dollars owed to the IRS. They have alleged the scheme dates to 2000 and involved sham foundations and shell companies in Panama, Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands.

Mr. Fonseca has said the firm, which closed in 2018, had no control over how its clients might use offshore vehicles created for them.

Both Mr. Mossack and Mr. Fonseca have Panamanian citizenship, NDR reported, and Panama does not extradite its own citizens so it is unclear whether either will ever be brought to Germany for trial.

Neither Mr. Mossack nor Mr. Fonseca responded to Sueddeutsche Zeitung’s requests for comment, the newspaper said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/germany-issues-arrest-warrants-to-founders-of-panama-papers-firm/article32906267.ece

Mr. Trump spent Tuesday evening in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he held a rally at the airport, and former U.S. President Barack Obama is scheduled to campaign for Mr. Biden in Philadelphia on Wednesday.

In Erie County — an overwhelmingly (87%) white, long-standing Democratic constituency — working class voters, driven by the decline in the manufacturing sector, had turned to Mr. Trump in 2016. The President flipped the county, beating opponent Hillary Clinton by 2 points.

Mr. Trump also won Pennsylvania by less than 1 percentage point in 2016. Mr. Biden had also campaigned in Erie earlier this month — the former Vice President is currently leading Pennsylvania 52% to Trump’s 43% based on polling averages from September 20 to October 5.

Mr. Trump, however, is leading in Erie and other western Pennsylvania counties (barring Alleghany counting where Pittsburgh is) by a narrow 50%-47% margin, according to a Washington Post/ABC poll from the end of September.

‘Great victory’

“Hello Erie, remember that great victory we had?” Mr. Trump said at the start of his rally on Tuesday night.

“With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, protect our Second Amendment, defend our borders, keep jobs and wealth in America, where it belongs,” he said, summing up his standard set of campaign talking points.

“This is an election between a Trump super recovery, which is happening right now, and a Biden depression,” Mr. Trump said, adding that Mr. Biden would “double, triple and quadruple” taxes. “By the way, Pennsylvania’s been shut down long enough. Get your Governor to open up Pennsylvania.”

The President has been banking on his economic record to get re-elected, but the economy has suffered a severe setback due to the pandemic. The country experienced record high joblessness earlier this summer — putting Mr. Trump on shaky ground. Voters are evenly split on which candidate can better manage the economy, the New York Times reported, based on an October 15-18 poll it did with Seina College.

Mr. Trump dwelt at length on the economy and the energy sector in particular at his rally on Tuesday.

“Joe Biden will ban fracking and abolish Pennsylvania energy,” Mr. Trump said. He also had a clip played — a departure from his rally routine — where Mr. Biden and running mate Kamala Harris had made statements opposing fossil fuels and fracking.

Mr. Biden has repeatedly stated he will not ban fracking: he plans to ban new gas and oil extraction permits on federal lands and wants to move the country towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 (which would have implications for fracking).

Mr. Trump also said a Biden administration would destroy the suburbs. [Mr. Biden has called this a dog whistle].

“No, you don't like projects being next to your house,” Mr. Trump said. “So much for your American dream.”

At one point in his speech, Mr. Trump’s mic stopped working. He joked that it must have been “Crooked Hillary” [Hillary Clinton] who was behind it, quickly moving to Ms. Harris. “But Kamala … Kamala…she will not be your first woman President. You cannot let that happen,” he said.

Attack on media

Mr. Trump also made repeated attacks on the media during the speech. He listed the media was in cahoots with the Democrats, big tech and the Washington establishment.

On Tuesday, Mr. Biden issued a statement on Mr. Trump’s visit. “When candidate Donald Trump visited Erie four years ago, he promised to bring back jobs. President Trump’s visit to Erie today is a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that he broke that promise and has repeatedly failed Pennsylvania’s families over the last four years,” Mr. Biden said.

He also said Mr. Trump had incentivised companies to offshore jobs, “waged war on unions” and misled Americans on the severity of COVID-19.

Both candidates are acutely aware of what the State could do for them with its 20 electoral college votes. Mr. Trump conveyed this at his Erie rally. “You know if we win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/13hncn/article32905919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-election-2020-trump-campaigns-in-crucial-erie-county/article32905920.ece

27,2020/10/21,Family of slain Saudi journalist sues Saudi Crown Prince,"The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Jamal Khashoggi’s fiancee Hatice Cengiz

The family of slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has filed a federal lawsuit accusing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of personally ordering Khashoggi’s brutal execution in order to silence the high-profile government critic.

The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., on behalf of Khashoggi’s fiancee Hatice Cengiz and Democracy for the Arab World Now or DAWN, the human rights organization that Khashoggi founded shortly before his death.

It names Prince Mohammed and a host of Saudi Ministry of Interior officials, accusing them of a brutal and brazen crime that was the result of weeks of planning” and premeditation.

Jamal believed anything was possible in America and I place my trust in the American civil justice system to obtain a measure of justice and accountability,” Ms. Cengiz said in a statement Tuesday.

Khashoggi disappeared on Oct. 2, 2018 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, seeking documents that would allow him to marry Cengiz, a Turkish national who was waiting outside the building. He never emerged.

Turkish officials allege Khashoggi was killed and then dismembered with a bone saw inside the consulate. His body has not been found. Turkey apparently had the consulate bugged and shared audio of the killing with the C.I.A., among others.

Western intelligence agencies, as well as the U.S. Congress, have said the crown prince bears ultimate responsibility for the killing and that an operation of this magnitude could not have happened without his knowledge.

A prominent government critic, Khashoggi had founded DAWN in order to push for democratic and human rights reform in Saudi Arabia and throughout the Arab world. Tuesday’s suit alleges that the defendants saw Mr. Khashoggi’s actions in the United States as an existential threat to their political interests and sought to lure him inside the consulate where a specially dispatched hit squad awaited.

Defendants resolved to put an end to Mr. Khashoggi’s efforts by any means necessary, the suit states.

Saudi officials initially offering conflicting accounts, including claiming that Khashoggi had left the building unharmed. But amid mounting international pressure, they settled on the explanation that Khashoggi’s death was a tragic accident, saying that the team was under orders to merely persuade him to return to the kingdom. The official account is that the meeting unexpectedly turned violent, resulting in Khashoggi’s accidental death.

In September, a Saudi court issued a final verdict sentencing five mid-level officials and operatives to 20-year jail sentences. The court had originally ordered the death penalty, but reduced the punishment after Khashoggi’s son Salah, who lives in Saudi Arabia and has received financial compensation from the royal court for his father’s killing, announced that he forgave the defendants.

Three others were sentenced to lesser jail terms. The Saudi court did not implicate Prince Mohammed or other senior Interior Ministry officials.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/u93qur/article31655201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THAFPSons-oG307EK1GF4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/family-of-slain-saudi-journalist-sues-saudi-crown-prince/article32905563.ece
28,2020/10/21,U.S. files landmark antitrust case against Google,"Other major tech companies including Apple, Amazon and Facebook are under investigation at both the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission

The Justice Department on Tuesday sued Google for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising — the government’s most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft more than 20 years ago.

And it could just be an opening salvo. Other major tech companies including Apple, Amazon and Facebook are under investigation at both the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

“Google is the gateway to the internet and a search advertising behemoth,” US Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen told reporters. “It has maintained its monopoly power through exclusionary practices that are harmful to competition.”

Lawmakers and consumer advocates have long accused Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising.

The case filed in federal court in Washington, DC, alleges that Google uses billions of dollars collected from advertisers to pay phone manufacturers to ensure Google is the default search engine on browsers.

Also read: Google sued in U.S. for tracking 'private' internet use

That stifles competition and innovation from smaller upstart rivals to Google and harms consumers by reducing the quality of search and limiting privacy protections and alternative search options, the government alleges.

Critics contend that multibillion-dollar fines and mandated changes in Google’s practices imposed by European regulators in recent years weren’t severe enough and that structural changes are needed for Google to change its conduct.

The Justice Department didn’t lay out specific remedies, although it asked the court to order structural relief “as needed to remedy any anticompetitive harm.” That opens the door to possible fundamental changes such as a spinoff of the company’s Chrome browser.

Google vowed to defend itself and responded immediately via tweet: “Today’s lawsuit by the Department of Justice is deeply flawed. People use Google because they choose to -- not because they’re forced to or because they can’t find alternatives.”

Eleven states, all with Republican attorneys general, joined the federal government in the lawsuit. But several other states demurred.

The attorneys general of New York, Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Tennessee and Utah released a statement Monday saying they have not concluded their investigation into Google and would want to consolidate their case with the DOJ’s if they decided to file.

“It’s a bipartisan statement,” said spokesman Fabien Levy of the New York State attorney general’s office. “There’s things that still need to be fleshed out, basically,” President Donald Trump’s administration has long had Google in its sights.

One of Trump’s top economic advisers said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints.

Rosen told reporters that allegations of anti-conservative bias are a totally separate set of concerns from the issue of competition.

Sally Hubbard, an antitrust expert who runs enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, said it was a welcome surprise to see the Justice Department’s openness to the possibility of structurally breaking up Google, and not just imposing conditions on its behavior as has happened in Europe.

“Traditionally, Republicans are hesitant to speak of breakups,” she said. “Personally, I’ll be very disappointed if I see a settlement. Google has shown it won’t adhere to any behavioral conditions.”

The argument for reining in Google has gathered force as the company stretched far beyond its 1998 roots as a search engine governed by the motto “Don’t Be Evil.” It’s since grown into a diversified goliath with online tentacles that scoop up personal data from billions of people via services ranging from search, video and maps to smartphone software. That data helps feed the advertising machine that has turned Google into a behemoth.

The company owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world’s largest smartphone operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system. Some critics have singled out YouTube and Android as among Google businesses that should be considered for divestiture.

Google, whose corporate parent Alphabet Inc. has a market value just over USD 1 trillion, controls about 90 per cent of global web searches. Barring a settlement, a trial would likely begin late next year or in 2022.

The company, based in Mountain View, California, argues that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives.

Most of Google’s services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps it sell its ads.

In a Tuesday presentation with a handful of reporters, Google argued that its services have helped hold down the prices of smartphones and that consumers can easily switch away from services like Google Search even if it’s the default option on smartphones and in some internet browsers.

A recent report from a House Judiciary subcommittee concluded that Google has monopoly power in the market for search. It said the company established its position in several markets through acquisition, snapping up successful technologies that other businesses had developed — buying an estimated 260 companies in 20 years.

The Democratic congressman who led that investigation called Tuesday’s action “long overdue.”

“It is critical that the Justice Department’s lawsuit focuses on Google’s monopolization of search and search advertising, while also targeting the anticompetitive business practices Google is using to leverage this monopoly into other areas, such as maps, browsers, video, and voice assistants,” Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island said in a statement.

Columbia Law professor Tim Wu called the suit almost a carbon copy of the government’s 1998 lawsuit against Microsoft. He said via email that the US government has a decent chance of winning. “However, the likely remedies — i.e., knock it off, no more making Google the default — are not particularly likely to transform the broader tech ecosystem.”

Other advocates, however, said the Justice Department’s timing — it’s only two weeks to Election Day — smacked of politics.

The government’s “narrow focus and alienation of the bipartisan state attorneys general is evidence of an unserious approach driven by politics and is likely to result in nothing more than a choreographed slap on the wrist for Google,” Alex Harman, a competition policy advocate at Public Citizen, said in a statement.

Republicans and Democrats have accelerated their criticism of Big Tech in recent months, although sometimes for different reasons. It’s unclear what the status of the government’s suit against Google would be if a Joe Biden administration were to take over next year.

The Justice Department sought support for its suit from states across the country that share concerns about Google’s conduct. A bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago they were investigating Google’s business practices, citing “potential monopolistic behavior.”

Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina and Texas joined the Justice Department lawsuit.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/6146mg/article32879013.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17NETGOOGLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-files-landmark-antitrust-case-against-google/article32904830.ece

30,2020/10/21,"Need strong alliance to counter China, Russia: Esper","U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper revealed a fresh drive to strengthen U.S. alliances with “like-minded democracies” in part through arms sales in an effort to curb the global influence of Russia and China.

Mr. Esper said the Pentagon would systematically monitor and manage its relationships with partner countries, aiming to find ways to coordinate militaries and to advance U.S. arms sales.

The initiative, called the Guidance for Development for Alliances and Partnerships (GDAP), comes just two weeks before the presidential election that, if President Donald Trump loses, could see Mr. Esper replaced in January.

He underscored the need to build closer ties to “like-minded democracies such as India and Indonesia” adding “they all recognise what China is doing.”

Global order

It also came after nearly four years of Mr. Trump’s efforts to restructure alliances, including threatening NATO.

“America’s network of allies and partners provides us an asymmetric advantage our adversaries cannot match,” Mr. Esper said on Tuesday, calling the network “the backbone of the international rules-based order.”

“China and Russia probably have fewer than 10 allies combined,” he added.

He said China uses coercion and financial entrapment to build its alliances with weak countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos. “The smaller the nation and the greater its needs, the heavier the pressure from Beijing,” he said.

He cited visits he has made to build defence relations with Malta, Mongolia and Palau, as well as U.S. plans for a greater presence in Eastern Europe, including basing troops in Poland.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/need-strong-alliance-to-counter-china-russia-esper/article32911652.ece
31,2020/10/21,Emmanuel Macron promises more pressure on Islamist extremism,"Macron added that a pro-Hamas group active in France would be dissolved for being “directly implicated” in the murder of the teacher.

A man who beheaded a history teacher outside Paris last week had been in contact with a parent leading an online campaign against the teacher, the investigation into the killing revealed Tuesday.

The breakthrough in the case came as President Emmanuel Macron promised more pressure on Islamist extremism after days of clampdowns which have resulted in over a dozen arrests, a mosque ordered shut and a pro-Hamas group to be dissolved.

“Our fellow citizens expect actions,” Mr. Macron said during a visit to a Paris suburb. “These actions will be stepped up.”

Police sources said earlier that the 18-year-old killer had exchanged messages on WhatsApp with the man who wanted Samuel Paty fired after his daughter told him how the teacher had shown cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in a lesson on free speech.

The parent — the father of a girl in Paty’s class — was behind an online campaign urging “mobilisation” against the teacher.

‘Not a minute’s respite’

The man, now in police custody, had placed his phone number on Facebook and exchanged messages with the killer — 18-year-old Chechen Abdullakh Anzorov — on WhatsApp in the days leading up to the murder, police sources told AFP.

Anzorov was shot dead by police soon after the killing.

Among other messages, the father had published a video railing against Paty’s choice of lesson material.

The mosque, now targeted for a six-month closure, shared this video on its own Facebook Page.

Mr. Macron added that a pro-Hamas group active in France would be dissolved for being “directly implicated” in the murder of the teacher.

The decision to shut down the “Cheikh Yassine Collective”, which supports the Palestinian cause and is named after the Hamas founder, will be taken at a Wednesday’s cabinet meeting, he said.

The group’s founder and Islamist radical, Abdelhakim Sefrioui, is currently being held by police for publishing a video on YouTube insulting Paty.

Prime Minister Jean Castex told MPs on Tuesday that the government was now targeting “all associations whose complicity with radical Islamism has been established”.

Paty, 47, was attacked Friday on his way home from the junior high school where he taught in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, 40 kilometres (25 miles) northwest of Paris.

Police have arrested 16 people in connection with the killing, including and four members of Anzorov’s family.

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin vowed there would be “not a minute’s respite for enemies of the Republic”.

Online campaign

Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said Tuesday that Paty would be posthumously bestowed France’s highest order of merit, the Legion of Honour.

The school said Paty had given Muslim pupils the choice to leave the classroom before he showed the cartoons.

But the girl’s father was outraged by him displaying a caricature of the prophet naked, and sought Paty’s dismissal for disseminating “pornography”.

On Tuesday, the head of the Pantin mosque, M’hammed Henniche, said he had shared the father’s video out of fear that Muslim children were being singled out in class.

Five pupils suspected of accepting payment for pointing Paty out to his killer were among those in police custody.

‘The decapitated Republic’

Paty’s beheading was the second knife attack claimed in the name of avenging the Prophet since a trial started last month over the Charlie Hebdo killings in 2015 when 12 people, including cartoonists, were gunned down for publishing Mohammed cartoons.

After Paty’s murder, Mr. Macron threatened that “fear is about to change sides”.

Junior interior minister Marlene Schiappa assembled French bosses of social networks Tuesday to discuss bolstering the “fight against cyber-Islamism”.

Tens of thousands of people took part in rallies countrywide over the weekend to honour Paty and defend freedom of expression.

The French parliament observed a minute of silence for Paty on Tuesday, while thousands gathered for a silent march in the teacher’s honour in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine in the evening.

Mr. Macron will attend an official homage with Paty’s family Wednesday at the Sorbonne university.

Darmanin has called for vigilance at schools to be bolstered when pupils return after the autumn break.

The next edition of Charlie Hebdo, meanwhile, will feature the headline “The decapitated Republic” on its front page along with cartoons representing various professions, the weekly said Tuesday.

32,2020/10/21,U.S. says Google break-up may be needed to end violations of antitrust law,"The lawsuit marks the first time the U.S. has cracked down on a major tech company since it sued Microsoft Corp for anti-competitive practices in 1998

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

The U.S. sued Google on Tuesday, accusing the $1 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals in the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech in decades.

The Justice Department lawsuit could lead to the break-up of an iconic company that has become all but synonymous with the internet and assumed a central role in the day-to-day lives of billions of people around the globe.

Such an outcome is far from assured, however, and the case is likely to take years to resolve.

The lawsuit marks the first time the U.S. has cracked down on a major tech company since it sued Microsoft Corp for anti-competitive practices in 1998. A settlement left the company intact, though the government's prior foray into Big Tech anti-trust — the 1974 case against AT&T — led to the breakup of the Bell System.

The federal government's complaint against Alphabet Inc's , which alleges that Google acted unlawfully to maintain its position in search and search advertising on the internet, was joined by 11 states. “Absent a court order, Google will continue executing its anticompetitive strategy, crippling the competitive process, reducing consumer choice, and stifling innovation,” the lawsuit states.

The government said Google has nearly 90% of all general search engine queries in the United States and almost 95% of searches on mobile.

Attorney General Bill Barr said his investigators had found Google does not compete on the quality of its search results but instead bought its success through payments to mobile phone makers and others.

“The end result is that no one can feasibly challenge Google's dominance in search and search advertising,” Barr said.

When asked on a conference call if the department was seeking a breakup or another remedy, Ryan Shores, a Justice Department official, said, “Nothing is off the table, but a question of remedies is best addressed by the court after it's had a chance to hear all the evidence.”

In its complaint, the Justice Department said that Americans were hurt by Google's actions. In its “request for relief,” it said it was seeking “structural relief as needed to cure any anti-competitive harm.” “Structural relief” in antitrust matters generally means the sale of an asset.

“Ultimately it is consumers and advertisers that suffer from less choice, less innovation and less competitive advertising prices,” the lawsuit states. “So we are asking the court to break Google's grip on search distribution so the competition and innovation can take hold.”

Google called the lawsuit “deeply flawed,” adding that people “use Google because they choose to - not because they're forced to or because they can't find alternatives.”

Investors seemed to shrug off news of the lawsuit, sending shares Alphabet up 1.9% to $1,563.51 on Tuesday afternoon.

“It's like locking the proverbial door after the horse has bolted,” said Neil Campling, head of tech media and telecom research at Mirabaud Securities in London, who added Google has already invested billions of dollars in infrastructure, technologies and talent. “You cant simply unwind a decade of significant progress.”

Political element

Tuesday's federal lawsuit marks a rare moment of agreement between the Trump administration and progressive Democrats. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted on Sept. 10, using the hash tag #BreakUpBigTech, that she wanted “swift, aggressive action.”

Still, coming just days before the U.S. presidential election, the filing's timing could be seen as a political gesture since it fulfills a promise made by President Donald Trump to his supporters to hold certain companies to account for allegedly stifling conservative voices.

Republicans often complain that social media companies including Google take action to reduce the spread of conservative viewpoints on their platforms. Lawmakers have sought, without explaining how, to use antitrust laws to compel Big Tech to stop these alleged limitations.

The complaint pointed to the billions of dollars that Google pays to smartphone makers such as Apple Inc, Samsung and others to make Google's search engine the default on their devices.

This means that rival search engines never get the scale they need to improve their algorithms, and grow, the complaint said.

“General search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising require complex algorithms that are constantly learning which organic results and ads best respond to user queries,” the government said in its complaint. “By using distribution agreements to lock up scale for itself and deny it to others, Google unlawfully maintains its monopolies.”

Google has been successful at protecting its profit derived from the Android mobile operating system, which is officially open source but companies that change it are barred from lucrative revenue-sharing agreements.

Justice Department investigators found an internal Google analysis of restrictive agreements determined that just 1% of Googles worldwide Android search revenue was at risk of being lost to competitors.

“This analysis noted that the growth in Googles search advertising revenue from Android distribution was 'driven by increased platform protection efforts and agreements,'” the complaint found.

Other challenges

The 11 states that joined the lawsuit all have Republican attorneys general.

More lawsuits could be in the offing since probes by state attorneys general into Google's broader businesses are under way, as well as an investigation of its broader digital advertising businesses. Attorneys general led by Texas are expected to file a separate lawsuit focused on digital advertising as soon as November, while a group led by Colorado is contemplating a more expansive lawsuit against Google.

The lawsuit comes more than a year after the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission began antitrust investigations into four big tech companies: Amazon.com Inc , Apple, Facebook Inc and Google.

Seven years ago, the FTC settled an antitrust probe into Google over alleged bias in its search function to favour its products, among other issues. The settlement came over the objections of some FTC staff attorneys.

Google has faced similar legal challenges overseas.

The European Union fined Google $1.7 billion in 2019 for stopping websites from using Google's rivals to find advertisers, $2.6 billion in 2017 for favouring its own shopping business in search, and $4.9 billion in 2018 for blocking rivals on its wireless Android operating system.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/5d4spy/article32906319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21NETGOOGLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/us-says-google-break-up-may-be-needed-to-end-violations-of-antitrust-law/article32906320.ece
33,2020/10/21,Bihar Assembly election | Nitish puts his faith in women voters for a win,"In his public meetings, Bihar CM focuses on reservations offered in government jobs and panchayat posts

Quite separate from caste arithmetic and loyalties, if there is one constituency that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has courted, it’s been that of women. So much so that his controversial decision to impose prohibition in the State in 2015 was also guided by the opinions expressed by his female support base.

Also read: Bihar Assembly Elections | When politics is an end in itself

This section has remained loyal to Mr. Kumar since 2010, and has also seen a steadily increasing voting percentage in successive elections: from 54.85% in the 2005 election to 59.92% in the 2015 polls, to nearly 60% again in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Male polling rates increased from 51% in 2005 to 54% in 2015. Women comprise 47% of the electorate of the State, and 24% of these voters are in the 18-29 age bracket.

This increase in women’s voting and much of it coming Mr. Kumar’s way has been one of the main reasons for his success.

In most of his public meetings, Mr. Kumar brings up his government’s focus on reservations for women in government jobs and panchayat posts as well as welfare programmes like Jeevika. He hopes that programmes like Jeevika, a skills and livelihood-based self-help group (SHG) project, will help him sail the choppy political waters he finds himself in currently.

The programme has enrolled 60 lakh households so far, extending credit to women who had very little access to it in the rural countryside.

Premsudha, a Jeevika member from a villa near Gaya, had a difficult domestic situation with a husband who had barely any income. “On top of it, my father felt that my husband’s family had mislead him as to his economic situation and wanted me to come away. I said that I was already married and would like to stay with my husband,” she said.

In 2011, five years after she was married, Ms. Premsudha’s mother-in-law asked her to join an SHG with a contribution of ₹10 per week.

“In 2012, I became a committee mobiliser, a ‘beat mitra’ and after that a micro enterprise consultant. I have availed loans upto ₹3,25,000 and bought a kirana shop for my husband,” she said.

Micro enterprises

In Mr. Kumar’s home ground of Nalanda, support for him among women is strong. In Kul-Fatehpur panchayat in Nalanda, Lakhia Devi, says that she has availed an SHG loan to buy cattle and start a small dairy business.

“I took a small loan for ‘pashu palan’ (animal husbandry),” she says.

Sushila Devi, who availed ₹75,000 as loan under Jeevika to add a couple of rooms to her house admits that while the welfare measures and reservations in jobs are moves that she is grateful for, the poor implementation of prohibition, with its spawning of bootlegging enterprises and local administrative collusion is not so good.

“Yeh prashaasan ko theek se karna thaa (The administration should have looked into it properly),” she says.

The complaint is not a vehement one as it was a demand from women voters that led to prohibition, but the dissatisfaction could be the reason why Mr. Kumar hasn’t been selling prohibition as an achievement in his campaign.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7ipgo6/article32911281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TH-JEEVIKA,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-election-nitish-puts-his-faith-in-women-voters-for-a-win/article32911282.ece
34,2020/10/21,Jamui: Striking gold on poll debut tough task for ace shooter Shreyasi Singh,"The battle is primarily between Singh, Prakash, and BJP rebel candidate Ajay Pratap.

She hit the bull’s eye winning the Commonwealth Games shooting gold in 2018, but securing the pole position on her maiden election outing may not be easy for Shreyasi Singh, the daughter of former Union minister Digvijay Singh, as she faces a formidable rival in RJD’s Vijay Prakash.

The 29-year-old champion shooter joined the BJP early this month and was soon nominated for the Jamui seat which votes in the first phase of the Bihar assembly polls on October 28.

Jamui assembly segment, a part of LJP president Chirag Paswan’s Lok Sabha constituency, has become a high profile seat because of the the presence of a sports personality of international repute in the fray where 14 candidates are trying their luck.

The battle, however is primarily between Singh, Prakash, and BJP rebel candidate Ajay Pratap, who is contesting on RLSP ticket.

A look at the existing social matrix shows that Rajputs and Yadavs are almost equal in number in the constituency that has an electorate of over 2.91 lakh.

While the BJP’s nominee is a Rajput, her principal opponent is a Yadav.

The constituency also has significant population of Muslims, Dalits, including Paswans, the support base of the LJP, Extremely Backward Classes, OBCs, besides upper castes like Brahmins and Bhumihars.

Vijay Prakash (49), the sitting MLA, is a brother of former union minister Jai Prakash Narain Yadav, a close associate of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad. He served as a minister in the Grand Alliance government in 2015.

Due to the presence of Ajay Pratap and Sumit Kumar Singh, son of former state minister Narendra Singh, Rajput votes could see a division to the disadvantage of Shreyasi Singh.

But, locals said, some other factors are working in her favour.

Besides being young and a popular sports figure, she is one among the only two women candidates for the seat, the other being an Independent.

Shreyasi Singh also has the support of Chirag Paswan whose LJP has not fielded a candidate for the seat. Paswan sent good wishes to his “younger sister” and appealed to the party workers to support her.

In addition to Paswans, Mushars, a Mahadalit community, which also has a sizeable number of voters in the constituency, are also favourably inclined towards her as its leader Jitan Ram Manjhi is a partner in the NDA.

The Dalits and other poor sections of the society, collectively called “Pachpaniya” locally, are rooting for her because they are ardent supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

They said the Centre provided free foodgrains to the poor during the COVID-19 pandemic, three gas cylinders free of cost and Rs 500 in Jan Dhan accounts.

“We will support whosoever is the representative of Modi,” Matloo Rajak, a native of Naukadih village said.

Arvind Thakur of neighbouring Bithalpur village echoed his sentiments.

Gender is also a positive factor for her. Many women of even Yadav caste are rooting for Shreyasi Singh.

“Let the men of our family vote for a Yadav male, we will support ‘behna’ (sister) Shreyasi in this election,” Renu Yadav of Lathane village said.

Sulochana Devi, of the same caste, also backed Singh.

Vijay Prakash is relying on the RJD’s time-tested “MY” (Muslim Yadav) combination, which has proved to be a winning formula for the Lalu Prasad-led party in multiple elections.

However, the presence of a popular Muslim Independent candidate Shamshad Alam may upset his applecart by dividing the pro-RJD votes. Prakash had won the seat in 2005, lost in 2010, but reclaimed it in 2015.

His supporters are banking on disgruntlement of a section of voters with the state government to see their leader through.

Several locals complained about lack development in the area.

“There are no industrial units, inadequate irrigation facilities, schools don’t have the requisite number of teachers and people are forced to migrate to earn a living,” said a resident.

At Jamui’s Kachahari Chowk, a group of young men was discussing the unfolding electoral battle.

“They (the government) worked for improvement of road and electricity in the last few years, but education and migration for jobs remain matters of concern, said Naveen Raj.

Another young man Deepankar could not agree more.

“There is Garhi dam under the upper Kiul Jalashay Yojana, but farmers still face problems,” he said.

Shreyasi Singh was in agreement with these young people. She acknowledged that migration was indeed a major issue in the area.

She said she wants to become the face of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Aatmanirbhar” (self-reliant) Bharat initiative and work towards creating employment opportunities so that people don’t have to migrate outside the state for livelihood.

Singh wants to establish a sports authority here to make sports competitive and professional in Bihar.

RJD candidate Vijay Prakash is using unemployment and forced migration as weapons to attack the state government.

“Youths are demanding jobs but the government is just handing them out hollow promises,” he said.

Though a greehorn in politics, Shreyasi Singh is toiling hard to win people’s support.

Driving through weather-beaten roads and walking on dusty lanes, she approaches the young and the old with folded hands to seek their blessings, reminding people of the humility of her late father, who was a minister in the Chandra Shekhar and Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments.

Belonging to the erstwhile zamindar family of Giddhaur, Digvijay Singh was known to be a self-effacing man.

Following in the footsteps of her father, also the president of the National Rifle Association of India for several years, Shreyasi Singh shows the same grace as she stoops to conquer people’s hearts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/w265yr/article32908943.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHREYASISINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/jamui-striking-gold-on-poll-debut-tough-task-for-ace-shooter-shreyasi-singh/article32908944.ece
35,2020/10/21,Bihar Assembly election | BJP-JD(U) alliance as ‘superhit’ as opening pair of Sachin-Sehwag in cricket: Rajnath Singh,"Attacking the opposition RJD, Mr. Singh said the people had witnessed its 15-year tenure and can see the difference between its “misrule” and the good governance of the Nitish Kumar-led alliance government.

Calling the BJP-JD(U) partnership as “superhit” as the opening pair of Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag in cricket, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said one can debate on the quantum of development done by the alliance government in Bihar, but no one can point a finger at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on corruption.

Attacking the opposition RJD, Mr. Singh said the people had witnessed its 15-year tenure and can see the difference between its “misrule” and the good governance of the Nitish Kumar-led alliance government.

Addressing a rally here in Bhagalpur district ahead of the Assembly polls beginning October 28, Singh said, “The alliance of the BJP and the JD(U) is as superhit as the opening pair of Sachin and Sehwag of Indian cricket team.”

He said the alliance government has provided basic facilities of electricity, road and water, which Bihar lacked for decades.

“People have seen the 15-year rule of ‘lalten’ (RJD’s poll symbol lantern) and they have also seen the development of Bihar during the BJP-JD(U) alliance government. The performance of these two governments cannot be compared. The State transformed under the NDA government,” Mr. Singh said.

Praising Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his deputy and BJP leader Sushil Modi, Mr. Singh said there are no charges of corruption against them.

“I am not making this claim that Nitish Kumar has done everything for Bihar. It could be debated whether he has done enough work or less work or more was required to be done, but there can be no debate on their integrity,” Mr. Singh said.

Mr. Singh said no one can point a finger at Mr. Kumar on the issue of corruption.

Taking potshots at the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Mr. Singh, speaking in local Bhojpuri language, said ‘lalten’ has cracked and its oil has leaked and nothing will work now.

He also spoke at length about various welfare schemes of the Modi government such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.

Mr. Singh said welfare schemes of the Modi government not only empowered the poor and the downtrodden but also raised their standard of living.

Speaking about the soldiers of the Bihar Regiment who sacrificed their lives during a violent standoff with Chinese soldiers at the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Mr. Singh said he is thankful to the people of the State for their bravery.

“You all know what happened at Galwan Valley, it was Bihar Regiment soldiers who saved the pride of our motherland. They sacrificed their lives and I thank all of you for their sacrifice,” Mr. Singh said.

Polls for the 243-member Bihar assembly will be held in three phases — October 28, November 3 and November 7 — and the counting of votes will take place on November 10.

36,2020/10/21,Bihar Assembly Elections | When politics is an end in itself,"Voters are mostly discussing victory prospects of leaders, not jobs or corruption.

For voters of Bihar, issues such as unemployment and corruption have taken the back seat, with the debates revolving around personalities: can Chief Minister Nitish Kumar retain his chair; will the BJP have a Chief Minister of its own for the first time in the State; and is it possible for Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan to make or mar the prospects of Mr. Kumar?

In Paliganj, Arwal and Sasaram, most voters across age and caste lines appeared more interested in discussing these political scenarios.

“Forget about unemployment or mass migration in search of livelihood... these have been going on for years and years and will continue, irrespective of which party comes to power. But we are more interested in knowing whether Mr. Kumar will again be the Chief Minister or Chirag Paswan could be a spoiler for him,” Chandra Prakash Singh of Dawath village in Rohtas said, sitting on a platform with several middle-aged men on the premises of a temple.

At the Karakat market, Pankaj Kushwaha, Rajendra Kumar and Shiv Shankar Singh were heading for their village on a motorbike, all without masks and helmets. Asked if they were not afraid of catching the coronavirus, Mr. Shiv Shankar said, “Do you see anyone here in the market wearing a mask or a helmet? This is normal, and if you wear these two things, people will stare at you.”

Politicians sans masks

“Even campaigning politicians do not wear masks,” Mr. Kushwaha said and went on to ask, “Okay, you are from the press. So please tell me if Nitish Kumar will remain Chief Minister or will go… will Chirag be able to do something or is he just creating a bubble?”

Rajendra Kumar, in a white kurta-pyjama, smiled and turned away. He is a supporter of Mr. Nitish Kumar, the others said.

At the Bikramganj block office too, people were engaged in an animated discussion on whether the BJP would have its own Chief Minister now.

“I think, the BJP this time will get no fewer than 100 seats and have its own Chief Minister,” Ravi Shankar Singh said at a tea shop. “Not 100, but around 90,” Janardan Yadav added.

The debate then turned to Tejashwi Yadav and the RJD-led grand alliance. “The RJD will get 70 to 75 seats, but the Congress will not get to even double digits,” Mr. Janardan Yadav said.

Political analyst Ajay Kumar told The Hindu, “Bihar is said to be one of most politically aware States where people love to argue and discuss politics for hours and hours. But sometimes, they keep mum and throw only a smile when one asks them about their voting preference. We call them chupka [silent] voters.”

Numbers game

About 100 km away, at Sakri, Madanpur Dhawa and Chakia villages of Arwal district, people seemed less interested in discussing issues such as rampant crime, farmers’ woes or the pandemic. They showed interest only in discussing how many seats the JD(U) would win. “Nitish Kumar’s party would win around 50 seats or, it can go even below 30,” said Anshuman Sharma, a postgraduate in political science from Magadh University.

Asked why he thought so, Mr. Sharma said, “This time, he is being caught off-guard by none other than his alliance partner, the BJP. Don’t you see his body language these days while he addresses public meetings? He looks tired and defeated.” On the question of unemployment, he said, “It is an issue but we’ve lost hope from Mr. Kumar. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP can do something.”

Had Mr. Modi fulfilled his promise of giving a ₹1.25 lakh crore economic package to Bihar yet?’ “Not yet, but having its own Chief Minister, the party may think about it positively,” said Mr. Sharma’s friend Rajesh Chandrabhushan.

“Yes, the Bihar election this time veers around Nitish Kumar — will he be Chief Minister again, will he not?” Mr. Kumar, the political analyst, said.

Shailesh Kumar, a retired banker at Raniganj village in Paliganj, said, “I request you not to ask me any question about who will win or who will lose the poll, but please tell me whether Chirag Paswan is acting on behalf of the BJP. I think, without any green signal from the top BJP leadership he will not take such a big risk.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/gp9img/article32907634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN21NITISH,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-poll-narrative-will-nitish-be-cm-again-or-not/article32907613.ece

The funding round, led by private equity firm Advent International, included the participation of Exor (the holding company of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Ferrari), Airbus Ventures and FM Capital (a fund that includes a large number of top 100 automobile dealers in the US as its limited partners). “We believe Tekion will be the trailblazer for enabling the modernisation of the entire consumer journey,” said Mr. Vijayan, CEO of Tekion.

“Today’s consumers receive outstanding personalised retail experiences from companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Disney. Why shouldn’t they expect the same in their vehicle acquisition and service needs? We believe Tekion will be the trailblazer for enabling the modernisation of the entire consumer journey. It’s time to even the playing field for the automotive retail industry.

Tekion's Automotive Retail Cloud (ARC) provides seamless connectivity between vehicle manufacturers, dealers and car buyers, as per the company.

38,2020/10/21,Two-wheelers headed for strong festival show: ICRA,"‘Sector, however, to shrink 16-18% in FY21’

Two-wheeler sales are expected to grow during festive season despite the pandemic, aided by rural demand, as per an ICRA report.

“While the overall consumption and investment demand is expected to remain subdued for an extended period, some growth offshoots are visible from rural markets,” it said.

“Buoyed by healthy rabi yields, timely kharif sowing, progressive government support schemes and relatively lower COVID-19 impact, rural (and semi-urban) demand has enabled a sequential growth in sales since the unlocking in May 2020. A shift towards personal mobility in urban areas continues to augur well for demand,” it added.

“While the urban markets continue to grapple with rising cases of COVID-19, the relatively less impacted rural and semi-urban markets (albeit facing increasing cases now) have enabled a sequential improvement in sales ever since, said Shamsher Dewan, vice-president, ICRA.

“In August and September 2020, the industry recorded 22% and 19% sequential growth and a Y-o-Y 3% and 12% growth in wholesale volumes, respectively.”

While uncertainty continues to persist regarding the time it would take for the pandemic to subside, ICRA continues to maintain a stable outlook for the two-wheeler industry. It is expected that a low base, upbeat rural sentiments, and increased preference for personal mobility would support retail two-wheeler demand in the festive season.

However, despite the strong performance, the segment will see a volume contraction of 16-18% in FY21, ICRA added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/6kszty/article32911680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THBUBIKES,https://www.thehindu.com/business/two-wheelers-headed-for-strong-festival-show-icra/article32911681.ece
39,2020/10/21,COVID-19 lockdown hits natural rubber prices,"‘Prices of various grades fell by 10-20%’

Natural rubber production and prices have been hit hard by the pandemic-induced lockdown; coconut, however, has not been adversely affected.

Prices of various grades of rubber fell by 10-20% in the May-August period due to the lockdown’s impact.

The contrasting fortunes of natural rubber and coconut — Kerala’s two dominant agricultural commodities — are reflected in a detailed analysis of production and prices by D. Narayana, former director, Gulathi Institute of Finance and Taxation.

In January 2020, production of natural rubber was 10% higher compared with a year earlier. But in April, output dropped by 53% largely on account of the lockdown. Though prices of natural rubber witnessed a slight fall in the latter half of 2019, they continued to remain high till March 2020.

However, the price of latex shows a different pattern. While the price in 2019 had shown steep increases till October, the fall has been steady since then. The lockdown accentuated the decline, as per the study.

Pandemic proof

Unlike natural rubber, coconut was not adversely affected by the pandemic.

While the months of May to July 2019 reported prices 20% lower than the peak prices in the year, during the same months in 2020, the prices remained relatively high.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/covid-19-lockdown-hits-natural-rubber-prices/article32911647.ece

41,2020/10/21,Govt. to widen manufacturing PLI plan,"Addition of 8 sectors to spur investments; policy for strategic sale of PSEs almost ready, says Bajaj

The production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for manufacturing investments will soon be extended to eight more sectors, and the government is close to finalising its policy for the strategic sale of public sector enterprises (PSEs), Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj said on Wednesday.

“In the offing are about seven-eight sectors where the PLI scheme would be extended. Unlike our other schemes, this is an outcome- and output-oriented scheme… incentives will be paid only if the manufacturers make the goods,” Mr. Bajaj said. “This scheme will give cash incentives for five to seven years and all the sunrise and important sectors are proposed to be covered in this,” he added.

“I have a lot of confidence and hope in the PLI schemes for mobile phones, medical devices and pharmaceuticals. The kind of response we have received on mobile phones gives me a lot of confidence that there is now a demand in the world to have a diversification in your supply chains and India can definitely take advantage of,” Mr. Bajaj said at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Financial Markets summit.

Conceding that the policy for privatising PSEs had been delayed, Mr. Bajaj said this would be a major step that would likely get the approval of the Cabinet ‘very soon.’

‘Green shoots’

Referring to some of the green shoots visible in the economy, such as GST inflows and rail freight in September, Mr. Bajaj said that steel producers had just now informed the Finance Ministry that they were back to using their full capacity. “If steel and cement are doing well, it augurs very well for the economy,” he said.

“There are certain things in which we have not only seen improvements, but have also gone up year-on-year. I acknowledge as some of the commentators keep saying, last year itself was not very good, so you can’t compare. But I think I am trying to come out of a very dreadful disease. So I can’t be obese immediately, I have to eat my food before moving up the ladder,” he said, stressing that indicators point to an economy ‘trying to limp back to normalcy’.

Taking aim at ‘experts’ who ‘changed their opinions every two months’, the Economic Affairs Secretary said: “Initially, we had this very ‘doom’ kind of a feeling given to us, saying things will only go down.

“Suddenly, the festivals have come and the economy is looking up a bit; now the basic point being mentioned is ‘this is the pent-up demand and we will have to see what happens in January and February’,” he added, trying to show the shift in opinions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/7hu6c1/article32911612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THBUMANUFACTURE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/govt-to-widen-manufacturing-pli-plan/article32911613.ece

49,2020/10/21,Properties worth ₹33.39 crore attached in pisciculture bank fraud case,"A part of the loan funds was diverted for the production of a Telugu movie, says ED.

The Enforcement Directorate has attached 27 immovable properties, having a current market value of ₹33.39 crore, in a pisciculture bank loan fraud case.

About ₹1.72 crore from the loan funds was diverted for the production of a Telugu movie named Aakasame Haddu, said the agency in a statement on Wednesday.

The attached assets, located in Hyderabad and Vijayawada, are held in the name of Nimmagadda Ramakrishna, Nimmagadda Venugopal, V.V.N.K. Viswanath, their family members and associates. Their on-paper value is ₹11.05 crore.

The ED probe is based on an FIR registered by the CBI against Mr. Ramakrishna, managing director of the Venus Aqua Foods Limited (VAFL), and its other directors. They were accused of cheating the Union Bank of India (erstwhile Andhra Bank) of ₹36.97 crore.

According to the probe, the company availed itself of ₹19.44-crore loans by furnishing forged documents, including fake lease documents for 470 acres of fish farms.

The loan funds were allegedly diverted and not repaid, causing a loss of ₹36.97 crore. The agency said the accused also took fish-tank loans to the tune of ₹22.64 crore in the name of 54 individuals, including themselves, their relatives, friends, associates and their family members to the tune of ₹22.64 crore.

“These loans were taken on the pretext of pisciculture, but the money was siphoned off and diverted to the main accused, who in turn used it to introduce share capital in VAFL, which helped the company to borrow more,” said the ED, adding that a part of the funds was used to acquire assets in the name of accused persons and others.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/5b46he/article30666081.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-Enforcement-Directorate-ED,https://www.thehindu.com/business/properties-worth-3339-crore-attached-in-pisciculture-bank-fraud-case/article32910054.ece
50,2020/10/21,From Robert Clive as chief guest to no guests this year: Kolkata family tones down Durga Puja celebration,"For the first time, outsiders will not be allowed due to the COVID-19 pandemic

One day in the autumn of 1757, a cannon shot reverberated through the settlement of Shobhabazar, now a part of north Kolkata. It wasn’t a spillover from the Battle of Plassey, which had taken place only a year before about 80 km away, but still, in a way, connected to it. The cannon was fired to mark the slaying of the demon at the Durga Puja taking place at the newly built palace of Naba Krishna Deb, then Calcutta’s wealthiest man — complete with the title of Raja — for having helped Robert Clive in the decisive battle.

The chief guest at Naba Krishna’s maiden Durga Puja celebrations was — who else — Robert Clive himself. This grand event set off a trend. Soon, every wealthy Bengali worth his title was organising Durga Puja at home to assert his social standing, which would be directly proportional to the number of sahibs and memsahibs gracing his event. Nautch girls would be in attendance and dinner would include wine and meat.

While Naba Krishna had all the wealth, he had no heir, so he went on to adopt his brother’s son Gopi Mohun Deb. Later, though, he was able to father a son, Rajkrishna, through another wife, and in that home he began another Durga Puja, either in 1788 or 1790. Later, he split his wealth between the two homes.

A lot of water has flown in the Hooghly since then: Clive is now in the pages of history books and those grand titles are as good as family gold. But the two homes set up by Naba Krishna have been following the tradition of Durga Puja to a T. Except that this year, for the first time, outsiders will not be allowed in due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Every Durga Puja, it is the Shobhabazar Rajbari, where Clive was the chief guest in 1757, that enjoys all the limelight. Not much is written about the second Shobhabazar Rajbari that lies across the road, the one Naba Krishna built for his biological son Rajkrishna. The first one is known as boro taraf (loosely translated, elder son’s side) and the second as chhoto taraf (younger son’s side). The traditions they follow are nearly the same, except that a blank continues to be fired (now it’s a gun instead of cannon) only by the chhoto taraf family now.

“We are a big family, more than 200 members at present,” said Krishna Rajeshwari Mitra, a homemaker and writer, who is an eighth-generation descendant of Naba Krishna and belongs to the Rajkrishna branch. The 200 she mentions are the present-day members of this branch alone. “Personally knowing one another is by no means an easy job, but meeting up during Durga Puja definitely helps to be familiar with others and even remember faces and names.”

The one celebrated by the family, according to her, differs from the other Durga Pujas in two aspects. One, sweets and savouries are offered to the goddess instead of cereals; two, only male members are involved in the rituals right from the making of the idols to the immersion. And idols are crafted from moulds that date back to the times when Puja began in the respective palaces.

“Another point worth mentioning is that a band party accompanies the immersion procession. Once upon a time, a bird would be flown just before the immersion, a signal to Lord Shiva that the Mother Goddess was on her way back. Later, we began dropping a mud bird into the holy river. For the past two-three years, we have been releasing a balloon,” Ms. Mitra said.

So how does it feel, in the present day, to be a part of the Naba Krishna Deb family? “I definitely feel fortunate to be born in this family,” Ms. Mitra said. “At least in Kolkata we get some importance, especially during Durga Puja. But I was always taught to be well-mannered and humble. I guess these are things that children of all bonedi families (bonedi derives from buniyadi, or families that laid the foundations of Kolkata) are taught.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1ov04k/article32912126.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMSanchari-Deb-Ghosh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/from-robert-clive-as-chief-guest-to-no-guests-this-year-kolkata-family-tones-down-durga-puja-celebration/article32912127.ece
51,2020/10/21,"Singapore will reach out to India’s proposal on travel bubble, says envoy","High Commissioner Simon Wong says Tamil Nadu is a go-to destination for Singapore’s investments.

Singapore is looking at ways of rebuilding air travel in a way that is safe for travellers and residents, and the relevant agencies in Singapore will reach out to authorities for discussions regarding a proposal of the Indian government for a travel bubble with Singapore, High Commissioner of Singapore to India Simon Wong said.

“India is an important partner for Singapore and the strong air connectivity between our countries prior to the pandemic had been critical to driving the flow of trade and investment, and people-to-people exchanges,” Mr. Wong told The Hindu in an interview.

The High Commissioner thanked the Indian government for its support in helping repatriate around 400 Singapore citizens on two flights during the pandemic. He said around 50-60 Singaporeans are still in India as they feel safe here and want to continue their work in India.

Mr. Wong said that despite the restrictions during COVID-19, Singapore investments are still coming in to India, although it has slowed down a little bit. “For example, in the last one year, between August of last year (2019) to August of this year (2020), we have about close to US$2 billion worth of investments,” he said.

The High Commissioner, who was in Chennai for a series of meetings, also met Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday. He said that the government in Tamil Nadu was very serious about working with foreign investors, and Singapore was happy to be a part of this, economically. “I think the Chief Minister is looking at a forward-looking plan to transform the economy of [the regions] surrounding Chennai and, of course, Tamil Nadu. Singapore wants to be part of this process,” he said.

Mr. Wong said that in the past one year, between August 2019 and 2020, Singapore companies had invested close to $500 million in Tamil Nadu. He added that between 2018 and now, Singapore companies had invested about $1 billion in Tamil Nadu.

“I think because of historical links, many of our forefathers come from Tamil Nadu and speak Tamil. So, Chennai, Tamil Nadu in general, is a go-to destination for our investments. That is also the main reason why, despite COVID, we are making a trip from Delhi to Chennai. This is my first stop. And I feel that we need to, despite the health risks, we want to signal to the Tamil Nadu government that we take our partners very, very seriously. And we will also want to signal to our Singaporean investments that this is the preferred State to put their money in,” the envoy said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/singapore-will-reach-out-to-indias-proposal-on-travel-bubble-says-envoy/article32911980.ece
52,2020/10/21,Roll back festival train fare hike: Congress,"“Railways is charging 25% to 30% higher fares on special trains”

The Congress claimed on Wednesday that Indian Railways was charging 25% to 30% higher fares on special trains being deployed during the festival season.

Also read: Southern Railway to operate special trains for festival season

Addressing a press conference, party spokesperson Gourav Vallabh demanded an immediate rollback and criticised the government for effecting a hike during the corona pandemic.

“The hike is more for sleeper class than second AC... For example, the cost of a train journey from Patna to Delhi in sleeper is ₹510, but in the festival special trains, it is costing ₹650,” Mr. Vallabh said. “There is no reason to increase the fares in current times. On the contrary, these fares should have been subsidised heavily.”

The Congress said though the move to deploy additional trains during festival season was a welcome move, the government should not have burdened the common man with an increased fare.

“With millions of people having lost jobs in the last few months, the government instead of providing festival stimulus has decided to further pull the common man down.

54,2020/10/21,Rajasthan to become second State to reject farm laws,"Special session of the State Assembly will be convened shortly to discuss impact of the contentious laws on farmers

Rajasthan is likely to become the second Congress-ruled State after Punjab to formally reject the Centre’s farm Acts being opposed by large sections of agriculturists across the country. A special session of the State Assembly will be convened shortly to discuss the impact of the contentious laws on farmers.

Also read: Punjab passes its own three agriculture Bills

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said here on Wednesday that an Amendment Bill would be brought in the Assembly to nullify the applicability of the Central legislations, and a resolution adopted against the Centre’s stand on the issue of farmers’ welfare. The Council of Ministers took the decision to call the Assembly session at its meeting held here.

Mr. Gehlot said Rajasthan would follow suit after the passage of Bills against the Central statutes in the Punjab Assembly. “The Congress stands resolutely with our annadatas (food providers) and will continue to oppose the anti-farmer laws passed by the NDA government,” he tweeted.

The Council of Ministers laid emphasis on a mandatory provision for procurement of agricultural produce at minimum support prices (MSP). It observed that the removal of ceiling on the stock of farm commodities in normal circumstances under the Essential Commodities Act after the implementation of new agricultural laws would lead to an increase in black marketing, hoarding and price rise.

The meeting also deliberated on the restoration of powers for settlement of disputes in crop procurement by the civil courts. The State government had last month issued an order extending the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Act, 1961, to the entire State in order to regulate private entities buying produce directly from the farmers.

In another tweet, Mr. Gehlot lashed out at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president J.P. Nadda over his remarks on the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Mr. Gehlot said the BJP’s insistence on implementing CAA had led to communal tension even before the COVID-19 pandemic started.

55,2020/10/21,Integrated theatre commands next step in defence reforms: Army Chief,"Their formation will be deliberate, thoughtful and well considered, says Gen. Naravane

The next step in defence reforms after the appointment of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) would be the formation of integrated theatre commands, Army Chief Gen. Manoj Naravane said on Wednesday. This process would be “deliberate, thoughtful and well considered.”

Speaking at the College of Defence Management, Secunderabad, Gen Naravane referred to issues concerning the integration, theaterisation and modernisation of the armed forces. He noted that the appointment of the CDS and the creation of the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) was “a momentous one” and that the services needed to “demonstrate great wisdom and statesmanship in enabling the CDS, a long standing demand of the armed forces”.

“The next logical step in the process of defence reforms is the formation of Integrated Theatre Commands to synergise the capabilities and combat potential of the three Services during war and peace,” he stated. He, however, pointed out that this process would be “deliberate, thoughtful and well considered” and its fruition would take a “number of years.”

CDS Gen. Bipin Rawat had constituted teams headed by the Vice Chiefs of the three Services to study and submit recommendations on the formation of various integrated commands. The study on the first proposed one, air defence command, was in advanced stage of completion.

Expressing optimism over the future of the integration of the armed forces, Gen. Naravane said it was “an inevitability” as it would lead to “tri-services synergy” and optimisation of resources.

Gen. Naravane later visited the TATA Boeing Aerospace Limited (TBAL) in Hyderabad, a joint venture facility of Boeing and Tata Advanced Systems established for co-production of AH-64 Apache attack helicopters.

The special session of the Punjab Assembly on Wednesday witnessed unruly scenes as MLAs of Opposition parties staged a protest against allegations of scams in the post-Matriculation SC (Scheduled Caste) scholarships, even as Bills were passed during the session.

Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu; Leader of Opposition Harpal Cheema of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP); and Simarjeet Singh Bains, MLA of the Lok Insaaf Party (LIP), raised the issue of an alleged scam in the SC scholarships, demanding the dismissal of Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, who has already been given a clean chit by a committee of three IAS officers set up to probe the matter.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said that no irregularity had been found by the inquiries into the issue.

Hitting out at the SAD, AAP and LIP, the Chief Minister said they were indulging in petty politics with their unfounded allegations. He was intervening during the House proceedings of the session. The issue of the SC scholarship had been examined by three Additional Chief Secretaries, who had found no irregularity in the distribution of funds, the Chief Minister said, adding that the Opposition was unnecessarily targeting Ministers on the basis of media reports which had no substance.

Amid unruly scenes and slogan-shouting, during which the Akalis came to the well of the House to protest, Speaker Rana K.P. Singh told the AAP that they would not be allowed to speak unless they apologised for Mr. Cheema’s shouting at him (the Speaker, Mr. Singh).

After allegations of ₹64 crore misappropriation in the SC scholarships surfaced, the CM directed the Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan to conduct a thorough enquiry. Ms. Mahajan’s report, based on the findings of the three-member panel of officers, led by Food Secretary K.A.P Sinha, exonerated Minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot.

57,2020/10/21,Bofors is example of case sabotaged by party with lot to hide: former CBI chief Raghavan,"In his autobiography “A Road Well Travelled”, Raghavan writes scathingly about the role of the Congress.

The Bofors scandal is an example of a genuine case being sabotaged by a government run by a party that has a lot to hide, says former CBI chief R.K. Raghavan, placing the guilt of the case not succeeding in court on those that controlled the agency in the 1990s and in 2004-2014.

The corruption scam, which led to the fall of the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress government in 1989, related to alleged kickbacks in the ₹ 1,437 crore howitzer gun deal signed in 1986 with Swedish arm manufacturer Bofors. It was alleged that the Swedish company paid nearly ₹ 64 crore as bribe to politicians, Congress leaders and bureaucrats.

In his autobiography “A Road Well Travelled”, Raghavan, who investigated the case as director of the Central Bureau of Investigation from January 4, 1999 to April 30, 2001, writes scathingly about the role of the Congress but also says it is difficult to confirm whether the payments were actually meant for the party.

Former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi was also implicated in the case.

“It is possible some of the payments were meant for the Congress party. It is difficult, however, to confirm this,” he adds in his upcoming memoirs.

“The Bofors case will remain an example of how a genuine case can be deliberately sabotaged by a government run by a party which has a lot to hide from the public. The guilt here rested squarely on the shoulders of those who controlled the CBI in the 1990s and later during 2004-14,” writes Raghavan.

While Congress leader P.V. Narasimha Rao was prime minister from 1991-96, it was in power from 2004 to 2014 too with Manmohan Singh at the helm. The minority government headed by Chandra Shekhar for a brief period from November 1990 to June 1991 was formed with outside support from the Congress.

Referring to the preliminary enquiry registered by the CBI under the Rajiv Gandhi-led government in 1988, Raghavan argues that it was done because of the “huge public furore created by the Swedish Radio and (national daily) Hindu disclosures”.

“The government led by Rajiv Gandhi had no option but to do a thorough investigation, even if it meant an unobtrusive ‘operation whitewash’,” he writes.

Raghavan was in-charge of security at Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu, where Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991. The 79-year-old – who also handled high-profile investigations, including the 2000 South Africa cricket-match fixing, the ‘fodder scam’ and the 2002 Gujarat riots – blames certain “questionable judicial rulings” and “judicial insensitivity” for the fizzling out of the Bofors case.

“... The deceit and power of those who made money dishonestly was humongous. That they were able to successfully cover up their tracks is a sad commentary on our criminal justice system. The judiciary at the middle level was a willing accomplice, and its ‘holier than thou’ claim here was almost a charade,” writes Raghavan, under whose stewardship the CBI filed its first chargesheet in October 1999.

The chargesheet, which he calls “controversial and momentous”, named Rajiv Gandhi as an “accused not sent for trial” – because he was no longer alive – along with Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi, former defence secretary S.K. Bhatnagar, NRI businessman Wisheshwar Nath Chaddha alias Win Chaddha, the gun-manufacturing company AB Bofors and its then boss Martin Ar

The Delhi High Court in February 2004 quashed charges against Gandhi and Bhatnagar. The following year, in May 2005, the same court quashed all charges against the Hinduja brothers, also accused in the case, and others under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Later, in 2011, a special CBI court discharged Quattrocchi from the case, saying the country could not afford to spend hard-earned money on his extradition which had already cost ₹ 250 crore. The Supreme Court in 2018 dismissed CBI’s appeal for further probe in Bofors case saying grounds of delay are not justified.

Though conceding that the CBI could have acted faster and was “tardy” in its procedures, Raghavan defends it too and says it faced “several constraints and obstacles”.

According to Raghavan, a Tamil Nadu cadre IPS officer who did a stint as India’s high commissioner to Cyprus, the CBI “needed the nod of either the External Affairs Ministry or Department of Personnel or the Law Ministry” for every step in the matter of approaching the governments and courts of other countries, such as Switzerland, Malaysia and Argentina.

“This was compounded by the perceived apathy of the Narasimha Rao government to the task of ensuring the speedy process in the CBI investigation. For instance, just before the CBI decided to arrest Quattrocchi, it is conjectured that he was tipped off by a senior member of the government, whereupon he fled the country and escaped from the long arm of the law,” he explains.

On the question of whether there was evidence of any payment made directly to Rajiv Gandhi, he writes that his emphatic response has remained the same: “There was not the slightest evidence to this effect”.

But he asserts that the big question was, “and is”, with regards to money received by Quattrocchi and the Hindujas, both known for links with the Gandhi family.

Published by Westland, the 213-page “A Road Well Travelled: An Autobiography” is priced at ₹ 599.

58,2020/10/21,Election Commission reiterates COVID-19 norms for campaigning after parties flout rules,"Poll panel warns of penal action for breaching the provisions

The Election Commission on Wednesday reiterated its guidelines for campaigning during the COVID-19 pandemic after finding that political parties and candidates had been lax in maintaining crowd discipline during the ongoing polls.

With campaigning for the Bihar Assembly elections and bypolls across States under way, the EC wrote to all recognised national and State parties to reiterate it’s earlier advisory to parties regarding social distancing, mask wearing and other COVID-safe measures.

On October 9, the EC had written: “As representatives of public, this onerous responsibility rests with the political parties to ensure that they not only cooperate with the district machineries in following the due norms of public health safety as prescribed, but also instil a sense of discipline for civic behaviour in their cadre while doing ground management during campaign times. It is requested that you may like to issue advisory to all your field representatives to demonstrate utmost vigil and care to abide by all the extant instructions in large interest of public health and avoid any penal action for breaching the provisions.”

The EC had also issued broad guidelines on August 21 that said legal action would be taken against those who fail to comply with the rules.

“Instances of such public meetings have come to notice of the Commission, where large number of crowds have assembled in utter violation of social distancing and the political leaders/campaigners are addressing the gathering without wearing masks in complete disregard of the guidelines/instructions. By doing so, the political parties and candidates are not only flouting the guidelines of the Commission with impunity, but exposing themselves as well as the public attending the rallies/meetings to the danger of infection during the pandemic,” the EC said.

The EC said it had “taken a serious view of the laxity on the part of political parties and candidates, on the ground, in terms of maintaining crowd discipline” and reiterated the need for parties to be careful during campaigning.

It said the Chief Electoral Officers and district officials would be expected to invoke the relevant penal provisions against the candidates concerned and organisers of events for violations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r8r5db/article31153067.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-ELECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/election-commission-reiterates-covid-19-norms-for-campaigning-after-parties-flout-rules/article32909128.ece
59,2020/10/21,Opposition parties call for repeal of UAPA,"Senior leaders participate in online meet organised by People’s Union for Civil Liberties, demand release of all arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case

Major Opposition parties have joined forces to demand the repeal of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), charges related to which were slapped against activists in the Bhima Koregaon case.

Condemning the arrest of Stan Swamy, an 83-year-old tribal rights activist, leaders of the Congress, Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M), Communist Party of India (CPI), Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), emphasised the need for building a strong movement against the gross misuse of harsh laws like the UAPA. Father Swamy was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in Ranchi on October 8 and is currently in Taloja Central Jail.

The People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) organised a press conference on Wednesday to condemn the role of investigating agencies in carrying out “illegal” arrests, to highlight the humanitarian crisis and misuse of the UAPA to criminalise dissent, and to demand the release of all 16 activists arrested in the case.

V. Suresh, general secretary, PUCL, quoted some figures presented by the Home Ministry before the Parliament, and said, “There has been a steady increase in the number of those arrested under the UAPA — from 999 in 2016 to 1,054 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018. The conviction rate is less than 25% and even this conviction rate is make-believe as the actual figure is much lower. In almost 43% of cases, the chargesheet has taken a year or two to be filed.”

“There seems to be a threat to the unity and integrity of India where it stands today. Forces are constantly trying to harm the country’s federal structure and Constitutional institutions. The NDA (National Democratic Alliance) government at the Centre is trying to gag people who raise voice against atrocities against Dalits, tribals and weaker sections,” said Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren.

“This is a matter of great concern. Where the country is heading towards? Father Swamy, who has been guiding tribals in far-flung areas of Jharkhand for years, has been arrested. It is very sad that at his age, with health ailments, that he is in jail. We must all demand that Stan Swamy must be released...We all Opposition parties need to ponder over how to save youths from the current regime,” Mr. Soren said.

Senior advocate and vice president of PUCL Mihir Desai spoke about the case and said, “Three chargesheets have been filed and NIA has said the investigation is still going on and more arrests will be done, so bails will not be granted and the trial will not begin. The entire case is based on completely flimsy evidence. They [the prosecution] have relied on four to five witnesses whose names are not mentioned. They have relied upon evidence from computers, which we know is tampered. Ultimately, they will all be acquitted, but imprisonment itself is punishment. Therefore, the UAPA has to be repealed.”

Speaking over a virtual media platform, CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said, “Stan Swamy and Varavara Rao (co-accused) are octogenarians, and most of them [the accused] are above 60 years old and much more vulnerable to COVID. However, there has been no humane approach by the Central government towards them.”

“The UAPA this way cannot exist in the statute book. I would appeal to all political parties and civil society organisations not to see this as an isolated single law issue. We have UAPA, National Security Act and sedition laws. All political parties came together to repeal the POTA (Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002). Like POTA, this UAPA must go,” he added.

The senior Left leader said that the larger agenda of the present government was “the establishment of a theocratic and rabidly intolerant, fascist Hindutva Rashtra, which has been their objective for the last one century or so”.

Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, DMK leader, said political parties and civil society organisations must decide if the present arrests should be accepted silently or they should all stand up and fight against it.

“We have to come together, putting aside all our differences, and fight against draconian laws which suppress us, and these laws have to be repealed. We have been reiterating that the present government is using the pandemic as an opportunity to inflict laws on people,” said Ms. Karunanidhi.

CPI secretary D. Raja and former Rajya Sabha member said his party had been opposing the arrest of all Opposition leaders, intellectuals, students and activists. He said, “We have to fight against those trying to mute the voices of Dalits, tribals. Many laws are being used against activists. We need to demand the release of activists like G.N. Saibaba (90% physically disabled, convicted under the UAPA and lodged at Nagpur Central Jail).”

Mr. Raja added, “It is said Left Wing Extremism is trying to topple the government, but what about Right Wing Extremism (RWE)? The RWE is going to redefine the entire Indian nationhood. RWE is set to replace the Constitution. We will continue to oppose UAPA and sedition laws.”

Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor condemned the arrest of Father Swamy, who had spent four decades of his life on working for tribal people. Mr. Tharoor urged the government to release him immediately. “The charges are preposterous and at his age he deserves our respect and support,” he said.

Nationalist Congress Party MP Supriya Sule said it was a matter of great concern that people who have contributed to literature and culture have been arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case, which seemed to be about “dirty political vendetta”. “It is a shame that everytime someone speaks up against the government, he/she is being targeted and attacked. All democratic voices are crushed by the Central government...In the seventies, people experienced Emergency. This is an unannounced Emergency. This is a challenging time. We must raise our voice. We must not leave this task unfinished,” she said.

The PUCL expressed concern that Mr. Swamy, despite his being a patient of Parkinson’s disease and suffering other health problems, was in jail, and noted writer Varavara Rao (80), has been languishing in jail for more than two years. Apart from them, there are five other senior citizens currently incarcerated in the case, and being held without any role in the criminal conspiracy of the Bhima Koregaon violence that happened on January 1, 2018, the PUCL said.

60,2020/10/21,"Govt replaces safai karamchari, kahar categorisation for CAPF jawans with MTS, kitchen services","The Union Home Ministry recently issued an order to all paramilitary or Central Armed Police Forces.

The government has done away with service categorisations like safai karamchari, kahar, farash and masalchi for the lowest ranks of paramilitary jawans and replaced them with professional designations like multi-tasking staff and kitchen services.

The Union Home Ministry recently issued an order to all paramilitary or Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and directed them that all constabulary recruitments in these services be advertised and named as per the new nomenclature.

The CAPFs, every recruitment cycle, hire hundreds of jawans for rendering various administrative works for the combat troops of these forces, like cooking, cleaning, gardening, washing and some other daily jobs.

As per an order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the post of constable daftary (office boy), farash and safai karamchari (cleaner) and peon have been “merged” and now will be known as constable MTS or multi tasking staff.

Similarly, as per the order accessed by PTI, the posts of cook, water carrier, butcher, waiter, masalchi (kitchen helper who works with preparation of spices), table boy and kahar (helper for cleaning and other activities) have been merged and will now be know as constable for kitchen services.

“These decisions have been taken by the ministry on the recommendations of a committee that was appointed by the MHA under the chairmanship of an ITBP officer. The aim is to have a professional and respectable designation for the jawans who are at the bottom of the hierarchy in these forces,” a senior ministry officer said.

Also, the two broad categorisations will help in a uniform recruitment policy in these forces who engage hundreds of such personnel for a variety of administrative duties that run a combat unit of troops, he said.

There are no financial implications in doing away with these archaic designations, he added.

A CAPF officer said the move to re-name these categorisations “does justice to the aspirations of the personnel who apply for and undertake these jobs and does away with the age-old designations which do not evoke respect.” “A lot of these personnel do not feel it respectable to mention their service designation among their friends and family. These trades are specialisations that are earned after obtaining the required skill so why not give them their professional due,” the officer said.

The future recruitments in these forces will be done under these new two service categorisations, he said.

The CAPFs include the Central Reserve Police Force, the Border Security Force, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the Central Industrial Security Force and the Sashastra Seema Bal.

There are three other central forces – the National Security Guard, the National Disaster Response Force and the Assam Rifles – who recruit these category of personnel.

These central forces, with a combined strength of over 10 lakh personnel, render a variety of internal security duties, law and order management, border guarding, counter-insurgency and counter-terrorist operations and disaster rescue and relief under the command of the Union home ministry.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6hljx9/article32707913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CAPF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-replaces-safai-karamchari-kahar-categorisation-for-capf-jawans-with-mts-kitchen-services/article32909084.ece

64,2020/10/21,Govt. bringing in technology to make borders impregnable: Amit Shah,"Comprehensive modernisation programme to prepare CAPFs for newer challenges of terrorism, cybercrime and border security.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday said the government was bringing in technology to make the country’s borders “impregnable” and detailed preparations were being made. It was undertaking a comprehensive modernisation programme to prepare the police and central armed police forces (CAPFs) for newer challenges of terrorism, cybercrime and border security.

Mr. Shah made the remarks at the National Police Memorial in Chanakyapuri on the occasion of Police Commemoration Day. The day is observed to pay homage to 10 policemen (of the Central Reserve Police Force) killed in an ambush by Chinese troops in 1959 in Ladakh's Hot Spring area.

India and China are currently locked in a stand-off along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh.

A ceremonial guard of honour by a joint squad of the CAPFs was presented during the event that was attended by Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, Director of the Intelligence Bureau Arvinda Kumar and chiefs of the CAPFs.

New challenges

“The work of police is witnessing new challenges and new dimensions in the areas of terrorism, fake currency, narcotics control, cybercrime, arms smuggling, human trafficking. It is a challenge to prepare the police forces for the new dimensions that have emerged in the last 2-3 decades. We have prepared a comprehensive modernisation programme for the police and I am hopeful that in the coming days the Modi government will prepare them to meet these challenges”, Mr. Shah said.

The technology and promptness of troops would go hand in hand and “we will be able to better secure our borders”, he said.

The government was “going to do many things” so that the deficiency in availability of police personnel per one lakh population was addressed, he noted.

Mr. Shah lauded the police personnel for ensuring internal and border security in the country with their vigilance.

He said a total of 35,398 police and CAPF personnel had laid down their lives in the line of duty till now, with 264 making the supreme sacrifice in the past year.

65,2020/10/21,India-Germany flights resume after 3 weeks,"There was a disagreement between two sides, leading to a three-week impasse

After a three-week impasse between India and Germany that led to the suspension of flights between the two countries, the Government of India on Wednesday announced the resumption of services.

“In continuance to the existing Air Bubble arrangement between India and Germany, the flight operations of @airindiain and @lufthansa between the two countries have recommenced. Please plan your travels accordingly”, the Ministry of Civil Aviation tweeted.

According to a senior DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) official, both Lufthansa and Air India will ferry 10 flights each per week. This agreement is for two months.

The disagreement between the two sides was primarily due to the fewer number of flights allowed to Air India (3-4 weekly) as compared to those allowed to Lufthansa (20 weekly).

Minister for Civil Aviation Hardeep Puri said Lufthansa was using the air bubble agreement to ferry “sixth freedom rights” passengers, or passengers destined to travel beyond Germany.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/opzzcq/article32726549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Lufthansa-flightjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-germany-flights-resume-after-3-weeks/article32907838.ece
66,2020/10/21,"SC to examine if educational institutions, varsities fall under consumer law","An appeal was filed by students of a medical course against Vinayaka Mission University, alleging deficiency in services.

The Supreme Court has agreed to examine the question as to whether an educational institution or university can be sued under the consumer protection law for deficiency in services, saying there have been “divergent views” of the top court on the issue.

A bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee has admitted an appeal filed by Manu Solanki and other students of a medical course against Vinayaka Mission University at Salem in Tamil Nadu, alleging deficiency in services.

“Since there are divergent views of this Court bearing on the subject as to whether an educational institution or University would be subject to the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 1986, the appeal would require admission. Admit,” the top court said in its order of October 15.

It asked lawyer Soumyajit, appearing on behalf of caveator university, to file the response within six weeks to the appeal filed against a decision of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC).

The university has relied upon apex court judgments in the Maharshi Dayanand University and in the PT Koshy cases to say that these verdicts have held that the education is not a commodity and educational institutions are not providing any kind of service.

Hence, in matter of admission and fees, there cannot be a kind of service and therefore, there cannot be a question of deficiency of service to be adjudicated upon in consumer forum or commissions.

The students, however, cited other judgments in which it has been held that educational institutions would come within the purview of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.

Solanki and eight other students of the a medical course of the university had sought a compensation of ₹ 1.4 crore each alleging deficiency in service and on account of “loss of social standing, academic years, career opportunities, mental and physical agony.”

They alleged the university induced them to take admission in the course on a false assurance that it had all the requisite approvals from the authorities.

The students were admitted in the offshore programme in 2005-2006 comprising of two year study in Thailand and two-and-a half year study in the university here, the plea said.

The students were assured that they would be getting their MBBS final degree conferred by the university and recognized by the Indian Government and Medical Council of India.

However, after two years of study in Thailand, the students were informed that they should continue their course at Thailand and would be conferred a Foreign Medical Degree and should subsequently appear for screening test in India, the plea alleged.

The students said they suffered loss of career opportunities as the National Board of Examination said that their qualification was “not a primary medical qualification since the Degree is not recognized by the Medical Council of India or the Council of Thailand.”

The NCDRC, in its judgement of January 20, had said, “We are of the considered opinion that the institutions rendering education including vocational courses and activities undertaken during the process of pre-admission as well as post-admission and also imparting excursion tours, picnics, extra co-curricular activities, swimming, sport, etc. except Coaching Institutions, will, therefore, not be covered under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.”

Aggrieved by this, the students filed an appeal in the apex court.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/5wb29y/article32789799.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE06SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-to-examine-if-educational-institutions-varsities-fall-under-consumer-law/article32907722.ece
67,2020/10/21,Pollution linked to infant deaths in India: report,"After a decline in pollution due to lockdown, pollution levels are again rising.

Outdoor and household particulate matter pollution contributed to the deaths of more than 1,16,000 Indian infants in their first month of life in 2019, according to State of Global Air 2020 report by the U.S.-based Health Effects Institute.

More than half of these deaths were associated with outdoor PM2.5 and others linked to use of solid fuels such as charcoal, wood, and animal dung for cooking.

India faced the highest per capita pollution exposure—or 83.2 μg/cubic metre — in the world, followed by Nepal at 83.1 μg/cubic metre and Niger at 80.1, according to the report, which sources its data from publicly available sources. Countries with the least population exposure are below 8 micrograms (μg) per cubic metre.

The government has claimed that average pollution levels in India are declining over the last three years but these have been marginal, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic plains, which see extremely high particulate matter pollution exposure particularly during winter.

After a decline in pollution due to the lockdown, pollution levels are again rising and air quality has already dipped to ‘very poor’ category in several cities.

Long-term exposure to outdoor and household air pollution contributed to over 1.67 million annual deaths from stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung cancer, chronic lung diseases and neonatal diseases in India in 2019.

For the youngest infants, most deaths were related to complications from low birth weight and preterm birth and overall, air pollution was now the largest risk factor for death among all health risks, the report noted.

COVID-19 related concerns

COVID-19 — a disease for which people with heart and lung diseases are particularly at risk of infection and death — has claimed more than 1,10,000 lives in India. Although the full links between air pollution and COVID-19 are not yet known, there is clear evidence linking air pollution and increased heart and lung diseases, creating a growing concern that exposures to high levels of air pollution, during winter months in South Asian countries and East Asia, could worsen the effects of COVID-19.

“An infant’s health is critical to the future of every society, and this newest evidence suggests an especially high risk for infants born in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa,” said Dan Greenbaum, president of HEI, in a statement. “Although there has been slow and steady reduction in household reliance on poor-quality fuels, the air pollution from these fuels continues to be a key factor in the deaths of these youngest infants.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/vu1v5r/article32888206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL19-POLLUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pollution-linked-to-116000-infant-deaths-in-india-in-2019-report/article32907489.ece
68,2020/10/21,BJP holds meetings with farmers but can’t hear their pain: Priyanka,"She claims that paddy farmers across U.P. were ‘forced’ to sell their produce at ₹800 below MSP

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday said the BJP government was not “hearing” farmers’ pain but was holding meetings with them to push for laws that “take away” their rights.

Ms. Vadra claimed on Twitter that paddy farmers across Uttar Pradesh were ‘forced’ to sell their produce at ₹800 below the minimum support price (MSP). She tagged a video clip of a farmer from Ballia, who complains of corruption by officials while procuring his produce.

The BJP government was holding khat sammelan (informal meeting with farmers) on the Bills that kill their rights but was not hearing their pain, she said in a Hindi tweet.

""Almost across U.P., farmers are forced to sell their paddy at ₹1100-₹1000, at least ₹ 800 less than ₹ 1868 fixed as MSP. This is when the MSP is guaranteed. Imagine, what will happen when this guarantee of MSP ends,” she asked.

Punjab laws

Her comments come a day after the Congress-ruled Punjab became the first State in the country to pass laws in the Assembly to “undo” the three agriculture sector laws enacted by Parliament.

Arguing against the Central laws, the Congress alleged that they would weaken the position of farmers and wouldn’t guarantee MSP for their produce.

The BJP, however, accused the Congress of misleading farmers and asserted that while farmers would continue to get the MSP, the new laws now allowed them to sell their produce anywhere in the country by easing the curbs and restrictions under the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) regime.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-holds-meetings-with-farmers-but-cant-hear-their-pain-priyanka/article32907420.ece
69,2020/10/21,Very large portion of COVID-19 vaccines likely to be manufactured in India: Gates Foundation CEO,"“We have been providing support, so called upstream, or research and development.”

A very large portion of COVID-19 vaccines are likely to be manufactured in India through the country’s strong and robust private sector partners, said Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman.

In an interview to PTI, Mr. Suzman noted that India is doing everything it can right now with the resources at hand to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I think India is doing everything it can right now with the resources at hand, but we are all hopeful that next year as some of these vaccines should come out...and our expectation is that a very large portion of these are likely to be manufactured in India through the strong and robust Indian private sector partners and then that will be the key area to focus on in the next phase of the COVID pandemic,” he said.

He underlined the need to have equitable global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.

“We believe passionately that there needs to be equitable global distribution, so everything we are doing is to make sure that the developing countries will be able to have access at the same time and at the same volumes as wealthy countries, because for a global pandemic that is essential, but then the exact pacing and distribution within the countries is going to depend on national guidelines with some of the global recommendations,” he said.

He said the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation has been working at multiple levels to combat COVID-19.

“We have been providing support, so called upstream, or research and development. We work with this organization, CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, which has been a leading partner in investing in the potential vaccines. We have developed something called a therapeutic accelerator which has raised over USD 125 million to help find treatments that are going to be effective against COVID,” he said.

He said the foundation has been working to support a lot of work around diagnostics as well. “And in that context, we are strong supporters of this global effort, which India is part of, called COVAX, which is a multilateral initiative to procure vaccines at scale and then distribute them through the GAVI vaccine alliance to countries including India,” Mr. Suzman added.

“And last but not least, we have also been directly supporting some specific investments, again some with Indian partners like Serum Institute of India and GAVI around particular vaccines which are very promising in order to make sure many of the products are being manufactured in real time and even ahead of regulatory approval for potential distribution because we want to make sure that the distribution goes to developing countries at the same time as rich countries, that you don’t have the time lag with rich countries having bought up early available market, which have been the risk,” he said.

He said the biggest learning from the pandemic is that at all levels, global, regional, national, there needs to be a permanent infrastructure in place that is prepared and ready to go which will keep the world much better prepared for the next one, which will come.

“It is not as if the pandemic was really that much of a surprise, maybe the scale, the speed and the exact nature of the pathogen could not have been predicted but as Bill Gates and others have been warning for years, this has been one of the most likely global crises,” he said.

“But we know that unknown pathogens have the potential to come in and wreak havoc so we should never again be caught flat footed. We need a global infrastructure, regional infrastructure and national infrastructure and right down to the community health level,” he added.

Responding to a question on how the Grand Challenges platform is relevant for the current pandemic situation, he said some of the networks and groups of scientists that joined the Grand Challenges are working hard on many aspects of COVID-19.

The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldier was handed over to Chinese side at Chushul-Moldo meeting point late on Tuesday, a defence source said.

The soldier had been handed over to PLA frontier troops in the early hours on Wednesday (as per Beijing time), the website of the PLA said, citing military media.

An official source said both sides are working out dates for the eighth round of Corps Commander talks possibly this week. The last round of talks was held on October 12 at Chushul and a joint statement issued later said both sides held “a sincere, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement along the Line of Actual Control in the Western Sector of India-China border areas.” However, there has been no movement on disengagement and de-escalation so far.

China’s military had said late on Monday that it was in touch with India over the case of the Chinese soldier who had strayed across the LAC in Demchok sector, and had been apprehended.

73,2020/10/21,India will be most consequential partner for U.S. in Indo-Pacific this century: Esper,"The US Defence Secretary and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would be travelling to New Delhi next week for the 2+2 Ministerial dialogue

India will be the most consequential partner for the United States in the Indo-Pacific this century, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said Tuesday ahead of the 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue between the two countries next week.

Mr. Esper on Tuesday told a Washington audience that he and the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would be travelling to New Delhi next week for the 2+2 Ministerial dialogue with their respective Indian counterparts Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.

The exact dates of the ministerial have not been officially announced yet.

“Secretary Pompeo and I will be there next week. It’s our second 2+2 with the Indians, the third ever for the United States and India. And it’s very important. India will well be the most consequential partner for us, I think, in the Indo Pacific for sure in this century,” Mr. Esper said in response to a question during a webinar organized by The Atlantic Council think-tank.

To another query, he said, “India is the world’s largest democracy, a very capable country, very talented people. And they face of every day with the Chinese aggression in the Himalayas specifically along that Line of Actual Control.”

“So, like so many other countries in that region, I’ve spoken with them (Indians). I’ve travelled from Mongolia all the way down south to New Zealand and Australia, from as far as Thailand to Palau in the Pacific island countries. They’ll recognize what China is doing,” he said, adding that in some cases, it’s very overt, and in many more cases it’s very opaque, what they’re doing.

“But they are putting political pressure, diplomatic pressure, and in some cases like India, military pressure on countries to bend to their way. We just can’t put up with that. We need all countries to follow those international rules-based order, to follow the norms that have served us so well,” Mr. Esper said.

The issue is not about China’s rise, it’s all about how they rise, said the Defense Secretary.

“That’s what we talk about in all these forums. Last week we had a Five Eyes Forum, right, the US, New Zealand, UK, Canada, and UK. Anyways, we have the Five Eyes Forum and we talked about the challenges in the Indo-Pacific and how do we cooperate together, how do we confront these challenges to sovereignty, to the international rules-based order, to freedom of navigation, he said.

The Indo-Pacific is a biogeographic region, comprising the Indian Ocean and the western and central Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam claim parts of it.

“So, you see a lot more closer collaboration come out, and this will be reflected in our meetings next week in New Delhi as well when we travel there,” Esper said, adding that there are a number of things that the US has been discussing with the Indians for some time.

“We’ve made good progress on a number of them, but we’ll release information on that when it’s appropriate,” Mr. Esper said.

Formed in 2018, the 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue meetings reflect the two country’s ever increasing convergence on the strategic issues.

“Last year, we conducted our first ever tri-service military exercise, Tiger Triumph, with India. And in July, the USS Nimitz conducted a combined exercise with the Indian Navy as it transited the Indian Ocean. We also held our first-ever US-India defense cyber dialogue in September as we expand our collaboration into new domains. Together, these efforts will strengthen what may become one of the most consequential partnerships of the 21st century,” Mr. Esper said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ytn5nr/article31043680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11MARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-will-be-most-consequential-partner-for-us-in-indo-pacific-this-century-esper/article32905679.ece
74,2020/10/21,Enactment of laws a sovereign prerogative: India to UNHCR chief,"'Violations of law, however, cannot be condoned under the pretext of human rights'

Enactment of laws is a sovereign prerogative, India said on Tuesday, responding to criticism of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Act by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The statement came in response to the comments about the law by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet.

“India is a democratic polity based on the rule of law and an independent judiciary. The framing of laws is obviously a sovereign prerogative. Violations of law, however, cannot be condoned under the pretext of human rights. A more informed view of the matter was expected of a UN body,” said Anurag Srivastava, Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs.

The Indian official’s remarks came hours after Ms. Bachelet urged the Government of India to defend the rights of human rights activists and NGOs. “India has long had a strong civil society, which has been at the forefront of ground-breaking human rights advocacy within the country and globally. But I am concerned that vaguely defined laws are increasingly being used to stifle these voices,” said Ms. Bachelet.

“Constructive criticism is the lifeblood of democracy. Even if the authorities find it uncomfortable, it should never be criminalised or outlawed,” Ms. Bachelet said. The top UN rights official raised the closure of Amnesty International after it was found to be in violation of FCRA rules. The official requested India to defend human rights workers and regretted that Indian laws were being used to punish human rights reporting.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has approved a new Defence Research & Development Organisation Procurement Manual (PM) 2020 to encourage more participation by the industry, including startups and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), in research and development and to achieve the objective of self reliance in defence.

“The new DRDO PM-2020 will facilitate the indigenous defence industry by simplifying the processes and ensure their participation in design and development activities,” Mr. Singh said after the release. It would contribute towards realising the objective of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat,’ he said. The DRDO PM was last modified in 2016.

Bid security declaration option for earnest money deposit, increase of threshold limit for advance payment, placement of order on lowest bidder 2 (L2) in case L1 (lowest bidder) backs out are some of the salient features of the new manual, which will assist the industry in speedy execution of projects, a DRDO statement said.

The PM-2020 also exempts bid security and performance security up to ₹10 lakh and does away with the requirement for negotiations for commercial off-the-shelf items or services wherever price discovery is happening through market forces. In addition, performance security for service contracts is linked to the payment cycle, instead of total contract value.

76,2020/10/21,CBI takes over probe into TRP scam,"The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has taken over the probe into a case of alleged manipulation in the Television Rating Points (TRP), following a reference from the Uttar Pradesh government.

The FIR was initially registered against unknown persons at the Hazratganj police station in Lucknow on October 17, based on a complaint from the regional director of an advertising company.

The complainant alleged that unknown accused persons had entered into a conspiracy to commit cheating, criminal breach of trust and forgery to make wrongful gains by tampering with the TRP ratings.

The process of calculating TRP ratings is monitored by the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC). Over 550 channels are currently monitored by the body through the bar-o-meters installed in more than 40,000 households in different parts of the country.

Stating that the identity of households where such instruments were installed had to be kept confidential, the complainant alleged that unknown accused persons deliberately leaked the details of such households to ensure that the instruments installed to measure the ratings could be tampered with.

He alleged that people in such households were incentivised by financial and other means to ensure that they watched a particular channel or programme to increase its ratings.

The complainant said that advertisers often took decisions to spend huge amounts of money for placing their advertisements on a particular channel or programme based on TRP ratings.

The TRP system measures the popularity of TV channels or programmes, using bar-o-meters that captures watermarks embedded in the audio signals of TV channel transmissions to identify the channel being watched, according to the BARC.

The Hazratganj case was lodged days after the Mumbai police registered a similar FIR involving three TV channels.​",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cbi-takes-over-probe-into-trp-scam/article32904828.ece

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has said that the government will fill 25,000 vacant posts in Police Department in phases and asked Director General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang to issue notification in December.

Addressing the personnel on the occasion of the Police Commemoration Day at the IGMC Stadium here on Wednesday, the Chief Minister said about 6,500 posts would be filled annually in the next four years.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy, along with Home Minister M. Sucharitha, Chief Secretary Neelam Sawhney, and Mr. Sawang, placed the wreaths at the martyrs’ pylon, and paid tributes to the police personnel who had sacrificed their lives in the service of the nation.

78,2020/10/21,Row over TTD decision to withdraw defamation case,"Trust board filed it during TDP term over allegations levelled by Vijaya Sai and Ramana Deekshitulu.

The decision of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Trust Board to withdraw the defamation case filed during the TDP term against YSRCP Member of Parliament V. Vijaya Sai Reddy and former chief priest A.V. Ramana Deekshitulu has triggered widespread criticism, besides raising question marks over the use of temple funds by the parties to settle political scores.

The TDP government had faced a rough weather in the run-up to the 2019 elections with several issues pertaining to the Tirumala temple taking the centre stage.

‘Missing pink diamond’

The political heat had turned intense with the YSRCP highlighting two major allegations levelled in 2018 by Mr. Deekshitulu — a ‘pink diamond’ going missing from the temple treasury and an attempt to excavate the temple, allegedly with an eye on the ‘hidden treasure’.

Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy had even accused then Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu of taking away the ‘pink diamond’ and demanded a search of his house.

Terming the campaign “mischievous and malicious,” the TTD board, led by Putta Sudhakar Yadav, filed defamation cases against Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy and Mr. Deekshitulu for ₹100 crore each.

After the change of guard, the incumbent board, led by Y.V. Subba Reddy, recently resolved to file an appeal in the court for withdrawing the case.

‘Pay up court fee’

The board’s decision came in for widespread criticism.

BJP State spokesperson G. Bhanuprakash Reddy flayed the TDP and the YSRC for “turning the board into a sanctuary for party leaders and making it a platform to settle political scores.”

“Who will take responsibility for the loss of ₹2 crore paid as court fee?” he sought to know at a media conference on Wednesday.

Members of both the TTD boards should volunteer to pay up the amount to the TTD exchequer, he insisted.

Chittoor district Congress leader P. Naveen Kumar Reddy wondered whether there really existed a ‘pink diamond’ as was alleged by Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy and Mr. Deekshitulu.

“If not, the two should admit in public that they had blatantly lied for political gain,” he demanded. Mr. Naveen Kumar Reddy also flayed the bureaucrats at the helm for trying to save politicians.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/row-over-ttd-decision-to-withdraw-defamation-case/article32911912.ece
79,2020/10/21,SEC moves HC against govt.,"Writ plea filed in court for funds to hold civil pollls

The State Election Commission (SEC) filed a writ petition in the High Court seeking a direction to the government (Principal Secretaries of Finance and Panchayat Raj & Rural Development) to provide budget and release funds as and when a request is made by it (SEC) for conducting elections. The SEC also prayed for assistance from the government in holding the civic polls.

State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar said in his affidavit that the government was trying to take control of the commission and its employees by miring them in controversies and casting aspersions on their functioning.

In the affidavit, he stated that the SEC was not being provided adequate support and resources needed to discharge its duties, as a consequence of his recent contempt petition against the government's action of not reinstating him as the Commissioner.

Mr. Ramesh Kumar pointed out that the High Court had struck down the AP Panchayat Raj (second amendment) ordinance - 2020 resulting in his restoration as the State Election Commissioner.

‘Funds not released’

He said the process of elections, which were postponed due to the COVID pandemic, was still under way and his reminders for the release of ₹40 lakh (which was sanctioned through G.O. Rt.No.35 dated January 17, 2020) was deliberately kept pending even as the SEC faced acute shortage of funds.

As the respondents did not respond, the SEC appealed to Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan in writing seeking his intervention in the matter in order to make the government enable the SEC to discharge the duties cast upon it under Article 243-K (3) of the Constitution.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sec-moves-hc-against-govt/article32910818.ece

The duo, a part of the ‘'Kanipinchani Nayanalu, Vinipinchina Ragalu’ troupe, instantly struck a chord with the audience by singing hit songs, before moving to court centre in the city late in the night. The couple -- a 20-year-old E. Sudhakar and his wife Rebecca -- select the songs with powerful social message to make people ponder over.

87,2020/10/21,First phase of operation to salvage aground ship of Bangladesh begins,"The exercise is likely to be completed in four to five days

Operation to salvage the 3000-tonne Bangladeshi ship MV Maa that ran aground near Tenneti Park in Visakhapatnam on October 13, took a baby step here on Tuesday with the salvor company, engaged by the owners, commencing the pumping of fuel oil from the ship.

The ship is carrying around 40 tonnes of fuel oil, and high power pumps have been deployed to pump out the oil.

“The ship has no power on its own and that is why we have deployed generators not only to supply power to the ship, but also commence the pumping operation,” said Surender Gill of Gill Marines, who have been assigned the first phase of the salvage operation.

“Pipelines have been laid from the ship to the road point and the oil will be pumped into mobile tankers. On the first day, we ran a trial run and was successfully able to pump out about 2,000 litres of fuel,” said Mr. Gill.

It is estimated that about 200 to 300 litres will be pumped out per hour and the company expects to complete the job in four to five days, working in all the three shifts.

The distance of the temporary pipeline from the ship to the road point is around 500 metres, but since the gradient is steep, the company is contemplating moving the mobile tankers to the Jodugudlapalem temple side on Wednesday.

“This may increase the length of the pipeline from 500 to 700 metres, but the gradient is flat and thus it will not put much pressure on the pumps and we can draw more in an hour,” he said.

Second phase

Once the fuel is drained out, the ship will become lighter by 40 tonnes and also the danger of oil spill while pulling it out using high-power tugs will cease to exist. After this operation is completed, the second phase of towing it out during high tide will begin.

The salvage of the ship has gained importance, after environment activists, raised a hue and cry and urged the authorities concerned to take up the operation on a war-footing.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/un54rh/article32904709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21ONGSHIP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/first-phase-of-operation-to-salvage-aground-ship-of-bangladesh-begins/article32904710.ece

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed the officials to act on humanitarian grounds in dealing with the people affected by the floods by providing basic food supplies, financial assistance, and ex gratia.

Addressing the District Collectors and Joint Collectors during the Spandana video conference here on Tuesday, the Chief Minister said that during these hard times, people expect the officials to be more empathetic. As part of the relief measures, the officials were asked to provide 25 kg rice along with one kg each of cooking oil, red gram, onions and potatoes.

Further, the Chief Minister ordered the District Collectors to provide an ex gratia of ₹5 lakh each to the kin of the deceased at the earliest. Of the 19 deceased, 14 families were given ex gratia. He told the officials to clear the rest.

The Chief Minister asked the officials to be on high alert and provide all help to the people taking shelter in relief camps and give ₹500 to each person in the relief camps while returning home.

He further directed the officials to focus on restoration of power supply and repairs to damaged roads on a war-footing and also stressed on providing safe drinking water and sanitation measures.

With regard to the crop damage, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy instructed all the Joint Collectors to submit the report on the enumeration of crop damages due to the incessant rains by October 31, including the budget estimates for the agri sector. He directed the officials to provide input subsidy to farmers without leaving any eligible farmer behind and a social audit has to be done in case any farmer was left out.

Input subsidy

“The State government is providing input subsidy in the same season and the kharif subsidy will be given along with the second spell of YSR Rythu Bharosa. The total subsidy of ₹145 crore for the months of June, July, August, and September will be credited on October 27.” For the month of October, the Chief Minister asked the officials to list the beneficiaries and submit them by November 15.

The Rail Mazdoor Union (RMU), East Coast Railway (E Co R), has demanded better working conditions to railwaymen, who were putting in their best efforts despite the pandemic threat.

The working conditions and industrial relations have gradually deteriorated in the railways in the recent past.

Gandhi told the media here on Tuesday.

He called for a united struggle to protect the interests of railway workers as the government was moving towards privatisation of railway and has already amended the labour laws to the advantage of managements. He demanded payment of bonus, which was the right of the working class, and to pay TA, DA and other allowances as usual.

Mr. Gandhi demanded that the government stop privatisation of railways, failing which, RMU would intensify the agitation apart from bringing all stakeholders onto a common platform to achieve the genuine demands.

Help-desks should function at all the hospitals, and this should be ensured in private hospitals within 15 days, he said. Posters should be arranged at the help-desks giving details about the precautions to be taken, and two Aarogya Mitras should run the help-desks. CCTVs should be arranged at the help-desks to monitor their functioning, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said.

He further said there should be no room for corruption in any of the hospitals, and that strict action should be taken against those who resort to graft. The Aarogya Mitras should monitor the availability of doctors, medicines and health services to the people, and give daily reports to the district Collectors, Joint Collectors, or the Health Secretary.

He said a special drive should be undertaken in the next 10 days to bring about awareness on the precautions to be taken by the people.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/focus-on-post-covid-ailments-jagan/article32904296.ece

104,2020/10/21,Sira is different from K.R. Pet: Deve Gowda,"JD(S) launches attack on CM’s son

Accusing the BJP of spending huge amounts of money to woo voters in bypolls to Sira and R.R. Nagar, the Janata Dal (Secular) leaders targeted the BJP vice-president B.Y. Vijayendra, who is staying at Sira to campaign for party candidate Rajesh Gowda.

At a party rally in Sira on Wednesday, which also saw JD(S) candidate Ammajamma, who had earlier been infected with COVID-19, making an appearance, the JD(S) party supremo H.D. Deve Gowda and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said their candidate was up against the financially-stronger BJP candidate. While the two leaders did not take the name of Mr. Vijayendra, the son of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, they said that Sira was different from K.R. Pete in Mandya, where the BJP wrested the seat from JD(S).

“The Chief Minister’s son has come here. What is his relationship with Sira? Instead of spending money here to woo voters, he can spend the money on the flood-affected people in North Karnataka,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said.

Earlier, Mr. Gowda, referring to Mr. Vijayendra, said “the BJP youth leader” had said that he would “finish off JD(S)” like in K.R. Pet. “However, Sira is different from K.R. Pet,” he said.

Denied ticket

105,2020/10/21,Munirathna’s supporters booked for attack on Congress workers,"Six supporters of BJP candidate Munirathna, including Lakshmi Devi Nagar ward councillor M. Velu Nayakar, have been booked on charges of assault and criminal intimidation after they allegedly attacked the Congress workers during the poll campaign at R.R. Nagar Assembly constituency on Wednesday.

Former MP and Congress leader R. Dhruvanarayana told the media that supporters of Mr. Munirathna attacked party workers when they were conducting a door-to-door campaign in booth numbers 108, 109 and 110 of the constituency ahead of the bypolls.

Mr. Nayakar along with other party workers allegedly snatched a voters’ list from the Congress workers and tore it up. They opposed the checking of names of voters in the list and objected to the campaign, Mr. Dhruvanarayana and Former Minister H.M. Revanna said.

The Congress demanded the immediate arrest of Mr. Nayakar and others who attacked the party workers and appealed to the police to maintain peace in the constituency. They demanded police protection for party workers.

The Congress workers gathered outside the Nandi Layout police station demanding the arrest of those involved.

D.K. Suresh (Congress), Bengaluru Rural MP, filed a complaint with the police demanding immediate action failing which he threatened to continue the dharna in front of the station. In his complaint, he said due to the attack by Mr. Nayakar and other BJP supporters, two Congress party workers, including a woman, sustained injuries. “Everyone has the right to campaign and seek votes, but the BJP is preventing the Congress from campaigning,” he told the media, and alleged that the BJP is creating bogus voter IDs and dropping the names of many people from the new lists.

Mr. Suresh further accused the police of inaction, and alleged that they dispersed the Congress workers who are under attack. “I have submitted a video clip of the attack to the police for investigation,” he said.

At another place, campaigning for party candidate Kusuma H., Mr. Suresh warned the BJP candidate not to intimidate party workers and he would be taught a fitting lesson if he had not stopped his supporters from attacking party workers

Councillor denies

Refuting the allegations, Mr. Nayakar alleged that Congress workers were resorting to unethical practices and offering money. “We objected to this and even brought it to the notice of the Congress leaders, but in vain,” he said. He denied allegations of the attack. “The police are witness to the argument between both party workers,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/q5dym4/article32912114.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGCONGRESSPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/munirathnas-supporters-booked-for-attack-on-congress-workers/article32912115.ece
106,2020/10/21,No change in CM; action to be taken against indiscipline: Kateel,"‘BSY will complete full term and lead the party in next polls’

A day after the Bharatiya Janata Party senior MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal publicly stated that B.S. Yediyurappa’s tenure as Chief Minister is set to end soon, party State president Nalin Kumar Kateel clarified that there was no question of changing leadership and warned that action would be initiated against indiscipline.

“Mr. Yediyurappa will continue as Chief Minister for the next three years,” Mr. Kateel said in a tweet on Wednesday. He also declared: “We will go to the next poll under his leadership.”

However, questions have been raised on the why it took more than a day for the him to respond to Mr. Yatnal’s remarks that embarrassed Mr. Yediyurappa in the run-up to the byelections and the biennial elections to the Legislative Council. Also, Mr. Kateel did not take the name of Mr. Yatnal during the reference to disciplinary action.

Meanwhile, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister K.S. Eshwarappa came out strongly in support of the Chief Minister and launched a straight attack on Mr. Yatnal and said he should be dismissed from the party without issuing a prior notice.

“Mr. Yatnal made a foolish statement. He is repeatedly issuing such statements and we will not value them. I appeal to our party State president to dismiss him from the party. There shouldn’t be any indiscipline in the party and we will take action against him,” Mr. Eshwarappa told media persons in Koppal.

“We recently held the BJP Legislature Party meeting and Mr. Yatnal participated in it. The Chief Minister asked all the MLAs to bring problems of their constituencies to his notice. But Mr. Yatnal was quiet in the meeting and later began making statements that the Chief Minister would soon be replaced. His statements might have made the Congress happy,” he said, asserting that “nobody can topple the present government”.

Though the Chief Minister was scheduled to visit Vijayapura district, from where Mr. Yatnal hails, on Wednesday as part of the aerial survey of flood-hit areas, it was cancelled due to inclement weather.

I’m following my conscience: Yatnal

BJP senior leader Basanagouda Patil Yatnal responded through a tweet to the criticism of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s supporters that he was making statements with an eye on the chief ministerial post or ministerial post.

“As an elected representative, I am working as per my conscience for the development of Karnataka and also as the voice of people. I have not reached the level of falling at somebody’s feet or pleasing them to become Minister. That is not my attitude,” Mr. Yatnal said in the tweet.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8p4b6k/article32912098.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGKATEEL2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/no-change-in-cm-action-to-be-taken-against-indiscipline-kateel/article32912099.ece
107,2020/10/21,Caste fault lines re-emerge amidst political ferment,"There is renewed demand to accept the caste census report that is said to show the count of two major communities as lesser than what is believed

The recent demands of the Kuruba and Valmiki communities for a better share in reservation, with the former seeking inclusion under ST and the latter demanding hike in reservation within ST, has again stirred the caste cauldron in Karnataka. Adding to the mix is the demand by the Panchamasali sect of Lingayats to be moved to 2A category under OBC.

These developments come amidst political ferment, with questions being repeatedly raised about the longevity of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s leadership and a fiercely fought bypoll. A section reads it as a “backlash” against the political narrative of the State coming to be dominated by ‘upper’ castes (Vokkaliga and Lingayat) after a spell of Ahinda politics under Siddaramaiah. There is a renewed demand to accept the socio-economic survey (popularly known as caste census) report, which is said to show the count of the two major communities as being lesser than what is currently believed.

Mr. Yediyurappa, a Lingayat leader, reportedly sees these demands as “orchestrated” attempts from within the BJP to topple him. “The reservation matrix is like a beehive and Mr. Yediyurappa definitely doesn’t have the political capital to meddle with it. Fulfilling any of these demands would only mean reconstituting the matrix, an exercise that will leave none happy,” a leader close to him argued, seeing it as an attempt to “precipitate a political crisis”.

Senior Minister K.S. Eshwarappa, who in the run-up to the 2018 Assembly polls raised a banner of revolt against Mr. Yediyurappa with the Sangolli Rayanna Brigade, is leading the Kurubas’ demand for ST tag. The participation of a few RSS functionaries at related meetings has raised eyebrows. Though Mr. Siddaramaiah participated in the October 18 meeting, he is reportedly concerned over the “forces behind the movement” and has stuck to his demand for caste census report to be adopted by the government, sources close to the leader said. “I am not here to only talk of Kurubas. I am of the opinion that all communities with tribal characteristics must be given ST status,” he said after the meeting.

At the same meeting, Mr. Eshwarappa assured that the State government will accept the caste census report. Sources close to the Chief Minister said he was not consulted by the Minister on the matter and termed the assurance as “mischievous”. A senior BJP leader perceived to be close to the RSS and the high command said the recent re-emergence of Mr. Eshwarappa as an OBC leader was a challenge to Mr. Yediyurappa.

These developments also work as a counter to the prevalent argument that if there is a change of leadership, Mr. Yediyurappa has to be replaced by a Lingayat only. “The BJP may also be looking at cultivating a constituency beyond Lingayats,” said a leader.

Mahasabha’s stand

Meanwhile, sources in the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha said caste census in its present form “deliberately undercounts Lingayats”, as it counts subsects under various heads, some not attributed to the community. “We want all from Veerashaiva-Lingayat subsects to be counted together. We will challenge the report legally, if need be,” a senior functionary said. The mahasabha on its part, said it was not looking at an alternate leadership to Mr. Yediyurappa for now. It had recently anointed the Chief Minister’s daughter Aruna Udaykumar as the president of its women’s wing.

However, the entire community is not backing the Chief Minister either. Panchamasalis, a Lingayat subsect upset over lack of representation in the Cabinet, has raised a banner of dissidence demanding a better share in the reservation. BJP MLA Basavaraj Yatnal, who has repeatedly questioned Mr. Yediyurappa’s leadership, belongs to this sect. “Unlike before, the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community is not entirely behind Mr. Yediyurappa. There are fault lines and this is being exploited by sections within the BJP to topple him,” a source close to the Chief Minister said.

(This is the first of a two-part series.)

Valmiki leaders launch hunger strike

Some leaders of the Valmiki Nayaka community, including Sri Prasannanandapuri Swami of Valmiki Gurupeetha, began a 10-day relay fast in Bengaluru on Wednesday demanding increased reservation quota and other benefits.

Their demands include hiking the Scheduled Tribe quota to 7.5% from the current 3%, doubling of MLA seats reserved for the ST category, internal reservation for the Valmiki Nayaka community and rehauling of the ST list by removing some “undeserving communities” from the group.

The seer has set a deadline of October 30 for the State government to issue a notification accepting all these demands. He has called for a Bengaluru Chalo protest rally on October 31, if the demands are not met.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ffkniv/article32912085.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGPANCHAMSALI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/caste-fault-lines-re-emerge-amidst-political-ferment/article32912086.ece
108,2020/10/21,Meeting next week on State’s readiness over vaccine: Sudhakar,"COVID-19 curve is flattening with a positivity rate of 5.5 per cent since past ten days; deaths under control, says Minister

Minister for Health and Medical Education K. Sudhakar on Wednesday said a crucial meeting has been convened in Bengaluru next week to discuss the steps to be taken for the delivery, distribution and administration in anticipation of development of a COVID-19 vaccine next year. Experts from various fields, including eminent doctors, scientists, and others, have been invited to attend the meeting to discuss the preparations to be made by the State ahead of the arrival of the vaccine, he added.

Dr Sudhakar said the State needs to gear up with the logistical support to meet the vaccine requirements, giving priority for the frontline workers who had been combating the pandemic.

Speaking to reporters ahead of a meeting to review the COVID-19 situation and the steps taken here in view of Dasara finale this week, Dr. Sudhakar said the pandemic curve is flattening in the State with the positivity rate falling to 5.5 per cent in the last 10 days. In Karnataka, 1.08 lakh tests had been done in the past 10 days, he said, adding that the ramping of tests had helped to contain the fresh infections.

He claimed that the pandemic was under control in the State when compared to other States since some States had reported 14 per cent positivity rate whereas it is 5.5 per cent in the State. “Initially, it looked that the State was reporting more cases. However, despite this, the State managed to control the deaths with early detection and treatment of the infected.”

With regard to the Dasara finale here, he said the turnout of visitors to Mysuru was not as anticipated since there has been no alarming rise in the footfall. “I had discussions with the Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar and I was told the tourist sites had been witnessing fewer footfall despite the festive season.

The police, on Tuesday, arrested two persons in connection with the murder. They had to open fire as the main accused attempted to escape after assaulting a policeman.

Bangaramma, 65, and her son Praveen, 34, were murdered at their place on October 10.

Shivamogga Superintendent of Police K.M. Shantharaj, in a press release issued in Shivamogga on Wednesday, said Bharat, 28, an employee of a private firm in Bengaluru, and Shruthi, 26, a resident of Kunnikodlu village in Sagar taluk, had been arrested.

He held a videoconference with senior Railway officers in Shivamogga on Wednesday. A.K.Singh, General Manager, South Western Railway, and others attended the virtual meeting.

The Indian Railways is expected to restart its services on all passenger routes in the coming days as the lockdown restrictions are being relaxed. The timings of some trains could be altered. The officers should make changes considering the benefit of people travelling from the district. The Jan Shatabdi that connects Shivamogga and Yeshwanthpur should be extended up to the city station in Bengaluru. Industrialists and merchants of Shivamogga should be benefited by the changes, he said.

The survey work on Shivamogga-Ranebennur railway line would be completed within a week and the tender process for the further work would start soon. Besides that, the acquisition of land for the construction of the terminal at Koteganguru would be completed in a few days, the MP said.

112,2020/10/21,Tourist footfall in Srirangapatna remains poor,"Gumbaz, Daria Daulat Bagh fall quiet during Dasara

Gumbaz, the mausoleum of 18th century rulers of Mysore Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, and Daria Daulat Bagh, also known as Tipu’s Summer Palace, in Srirangapatna near here used to draw a large number of tourists during Dasara festivities every year. But, the tourist attractions are wearing a deserted look this year.

The number of tourists visiting the destinations had been reduced to a trickle after the lockdown was eased more than four months ago. Though the tourist arrival had picked up marginally during the last two months, the numbers were nowhere close to the pre-lockdown days.

According to sources at the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in Srirangapatna, the Daria Daulat Bagh would receive between 1,000 to 1,500 visitors every day during weekdays and between 2,000 to 2,500 visitors during weekends before the lockdown. The numbers have now come down to just 100 to 150 a day.

“We used to get visitors from different parts of India and even abroad before lockdown. Now, most of the visitors are either from Bengaluru or Mysuru”, the source told The Hindu. Also, the entry ticket, which used to be ₹25 when purchased from the counter, is now available for only ₹20 online. Visitors to Daria Daulat Bagh have to purchase the tickets only online now.

Gumbaz too had witnessed a drastic fall in the number of visitors. Though entry is not ticketed, the revenues earned through collection of fee for parking of vehicles and safekeeping of footwear had taken a serious hit.

An ASI-protected monument, Gumbaz is managed by Tipu Sultan Wakf Estate. The accountant at the Estate claimed that the salaries of employees is borne from the revenue earned through fees collected for parking and safekeeping of footwear.

The poor footfall has also hit hard the locals offering horse rides to tourists and owners of shops selling souvenirs and a variety of other items.

113,2020/10/21,‘State govt. showing step-motherly attitude towards Kalyana Karnataka region’,"Accusing the BJP-led State government of deliberately delaying carrying out an aerial survey of flood-ravaged districts in Kalyana Karnataka region, KPCC working president Eshwar Khandre and Jewargi MLA Ajay Singh charged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa with adopting a “step-motherly approach” towards the region.

Addressing a press conference at the District Congress Committee office in Kalaburagi on Tuesday, Mr. Khandre and Mr. Singh demanded that Mr. Yediyurappa, who is slated to conduct an aerial survey of the flood-hit districts on Wednesday, should give enough time to access the damage caused by heavy rain and floods in Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Raichur, Bidar districts of Kalyana Karnataka region, and hold a review meeting with local representatives and discuss tackling the fury of floods.

Despite the government’s claims that there has been enough preparedness to handle floods, people in the grassroots level are battling even for basic necessities. “Nearly all districts of North Karnataka are reeling under floods and struggling on various fronts. Due to incessant rainfall, heavy floods and the spread of coronavirus, people are distressed and angry with the government,” he added.

Mr. Khandre urged Mr. Yediyurappa to lead a delegation from the State to the Centre to seek immediate flood relief assistance. Besides, the State government should release financial assistance to flood-affected districts on its own accord, he added.

Mr. Singh said that the condition was worse in Jewargi and Afzalpur taluks. In the last five days, there is no electricity in many villages as electricity poles have been washed away in the floodwaters.

115,2020/10/21,Plasma therapy: Hospitals ask for replacement donors,"While demand increases, doctors say there has been poor response from COVID-19 recovered patients to donate

Last week, the family of a 74-year-old critical COVID-19 patient had to scout for a suitable plasma donor as the plasma bank that had a stock matching the patient’s blood group asked for a replacement donor. This was even as the patient’s condition was deteriorating and the family was making one last-ditch effort with plasma therapy.

Amidst the debate over its effectiveness, the demand is actually increasing for convalescent plasma therapy, which is the use of antibody-rich blood plasma from a recently recovered patient to boost a critical person’s immune system.

However, as not all recovered patients can donate, it is hard for the distressed families to find a suitable donor during the crisis. On the other hand, doctors say that a poor response from recovered patients has made it inevitable for hospitals to demand for replacement.

Most private hospital blood banks authorised to take up plasma therapy in the city admitted that they were asking for replacement donors as it was “essential to keep the chain going.” While some hospitals give the patient a week’s time to get the donor, some others ask for immediate replacement.

“Although over 6.5 lakh patients have recovered, not even 0.5% of them have come forward to donate. Most recovered persons are either not willing to donate or feel it is unsafe for them to go out to a hospital to donate. Also, most are worried that their immunity level might reduce after the donation, which is a misconception,” said U.S. Vishal Rao, who heads the State-supported HCG plasma bank.

“Although we have given out 900 units so far, we have had only 500 plasma warriors who came forward to donate. Ideally patients can donate plasma every two weeks. While we need 200 ml for each therapy, we usually draw around 450 ml. The demand-supply gap is growing and unless there is replacement, we cannot keep the chain going. While we ask for immediate replacement, we do not hold the treatment of the patient if plasma is available,” said Dr. Rao. C. Shivaram, Consultant and Head of Transfusion Medicine at Manipal Hospitals, said, “We request the families of patients who undergo the therapy in our hospital to get a replacement donor within a week. Although we have been creating awareness about the need to donate, hardly 25% of our donations are through replacements. The rest are through healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses and technicians,” he said.

Safe to donate

Pointing out that an adult donor has three litres of plasma in him, Dr. Shivram said, “Out of this only 200 ml is expected to be enough to treat a patient. Whether one donates or not these antibody levels will go down in about three to four months. The good thing, however, is that the memory cells in the immune system that, when exposed to an invading pathogen, replicate and remain in the lymph nodes searching for the same antigen, resulting in a more efficient and rapid response to any subsequent attack,” he explained adding that it is safe to donate if the person has a good antibody level.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/xpfo6p/article32911710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGPLASMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/plasma-therapy-hospitals-ask-for-replacement-donors/article32911711.ece
116,2020/10/21,IMA case: HC unhappy over advocates sharing login credentials with litigants,"With several litigants logging in, video conference disconnects during hearing

The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday expressed displeasure over conduct of certain advocates of sharing login ID and password for the video conference (VC) hearing session, on the petitions related to I Monetary Advisory (IMA) group of companies. With a large number of litigants logging in, the VC link was automatically disconnected during the course of hearing due to user-overload.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi told the advocates that technical team had informed that link was disconnected as a large number of litigants/private individuals had logged in to VC hearing session, login credentials for which were shared only with the advocates concerned.

“Who shared the link with the litigants? Link was disconnected as a large number of litigants logged into VC hearing. If litigants want to watch proceedings, they can remain present in the offices of the advocates. They can’t join VC hearing in this manner. This kind of indiscipline cannot be tolerated...,” Chief Justice told the advocates, who had joined the VC hearing for the IMA case in the afternoon session of the court.

The Bench later requested the advocates, representing petitioners in IMA case, not to share login ID and password with the litigant while indicating the litigants can be allowed to watch proceedings in the offices of the advocates.

Serious view

Meanwhile, the Bench said that it would view very seriously if the State government failed to release by November 3 the non-salary grant for the office of the Competent Authority, appointed as per the provisions of the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Act, for the IMA cases. The grant is required to release amount for purchase of office equipment/stationery, outsourcing of vehicles for officers and payments towards forensic audit, videography, valuers, etc.

“The State government cannot neglect the competent authority appointed as per the law,” the Bench made it clear.

The Bench also directed the government to make payment of ₹12 lakh to the Central Bureau of Investigation towards expenses incurred to procure hardware gadgets for storing of data related to IMA cases.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ozw07g/article32911703.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ima-case-hc-unhappy-over-advocates-sharing-login-credentials-with-litigants/article32911704.ece
117,2020/10/21,BSY raised 1.3 lakh crore in a year: Siddaramaiah,"Leader of the Opposition in Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah has said that within a year and three months of his tenure, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had raised loans to the tune of ₹1.3 lakh crore putting more burden on the people of the State.

Addressing presspersons here on Wednesday, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that after coming to power, Mr. Yediyurappa had raised ₹46,000 crore during 2019-20 and as per the budget announcement for 2020-21 ₹52,000 crore was raised as loan. “And now in the additional budget another ₹33,000 crore loan is being raised,” he said.

He said people affected by last year’s floods were yet to get relief as there were no funds. “According to an estimate, the loss due to rains and floods in September and October is estimated to be around ₹15,000 crore. This is apart from the loss incurred during August rains. However, the Centre has not released anything for flood relief and none of the Central Ministers have paid a visit to Karnataka although the State has witnessed worst floods,” he said.

Referring to the aerial survey of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and review meeting with officials, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that officials would not give the factual report as none had time to visit places and collect ground report. Those who have been affected by the rains and floods would be able to give the actual report and one needed to speak to them, he said adding that he would be visiting the flood-hit districts of Belagavi, Vijayapura, Raichur and Kalaburagi on October 25 and 26.

On the statements by BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel, Minister Ashwanthnarayan, and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy about alleged harassment to Deve Gowda family and related issues, Mr. Siddaramaih hit back saying that all were lies of the ‘election times’. “If anything of that sort had happened, why Mr. Kumaraswamy was silent for over one year. What is the intention behind speaking now? And moreover who is Mr. Kateel to speak on behalf of Mr. Deve Gowda. Mr. Deve Gowda was in politics much before Mr. Kateel was born,” he said.

Regarding Mr. Ashwathnarayan’s statement about release of audio clips, Mr. Siddaramaiah asked the Minister to first respond to the audio and video clips that were presented on the floor of the House during formation of the BJP government in the State.

On Congress leader Zameer Ahmed’s statement that Mr. Siddaramaiah would be the next CM, he said he would not react to it. Moreover, the chief minister would be chosen by the high command based on the opinion of the legislative party.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bsy-raised-13-lakh-crore-in-a-year-siddaramaiah/article32911699.ece
118,2020/10/21,State’s daily test positivity rate falls to 5.42%,"TPR is vital marker in assessing spread of outbreak

For the first time after the lockdown was eased in June, the State’s daily test positivity rate (TPR) fell to 5.42% on Wednesday.

The TPR, which stood at an average of 7.7% in the last seven days, has been dipping since then. From 6.41% on Tuesday, the daily TPR further fell to 5.42% on Wednesday. The State’s cumulative TPR is currently 11.25%.

TPR, which is a vital marker in assessing the spread of an outbreak, is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. While cumulative positivity rate takes into account all the people tested so far, the daily rate is for those tested on a particular day. According to epidemiologists, a high positivity rate indicates that testing is relatively limited to people with high suspicion of COVID-19 and may miss new chains of transmission in the community. The World Health Organisation recommends that the daily positivity rate be below 5% for at least two weeks before relaxing public health measures.

From 6.76% on June 27, the State’s daily TPR saw a drastic jump to 11.2% in over a month’s time (on July 29). TPR hovered between 11% and 18% for a long time before it reduced to 13% in September. Then it further reduced in October and stood at 9.53% on October 11. From then onwards, the TPR has been on a decline consistently.

Attributing this to the high number of tests being conducted in the State, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar tweeted that the State has so far conducted 69,52,835 tests.

5,872 new cases

On Wednesday Karnataka reported 5,872 new cases taking the total to 7,82,773. With 88 deaths, the toll rose to 10,696. This is apart from 19 non-COVID deaths.

As many as 9,289 persons were discharged on Wednesday taking the total number of recoveries to 6,71,618. Of the remaining 1,00,440 active cases, 947 patients are being monitored in the ICUs.

Bengaluru Urban reported 2,717 cases taking the tally to 3,15,559. With 53 of the 88 deaths from Bengaluru, the toll in this district rose to 3,631. Active cases in Bengaluru touched 63,343.

As many as 1,08,241 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours including 21,623 rapid antigen tests.

119,2020/10/21,Chief Minister says compensation for flood-hit people will be given as per NDRF norms,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, while refraining from making announcement on relief in the light of code of conduct ahead of bypolls, assured after an aerial survey of flood-hit areas in Raichur, Yadgir and Kalaburagi districts on Wednesday that compensation will be given as per NDRF norms.

“We need another four-five days to get a clear picture about the damage caused by floods. As many as 14 taluks are affected in four districts and more than 43,000 people have been shifted to safer places. As many as 247 villages on river banks have been identified as sensitive and people in 117 of them have been partially shifted,” he said.

“Over 5,000 people have been rescued by NDRF, SDRF, Fire and Emergency Services personnel teams. And, 233 relief centres have been opened and 38,000 people are taking shelter in them. I have told the officials to ensure proper supply of food and medical services to the people who have taken shelter in relief centres. Compensation for flood victims would be given as per NDRF norms,” he said.

He was speaking to mediapersons at the Kalaburagi Airport after holding a meeting of Deputy Commissioners and other senior officers of the flood-hit districts.

“The Model Code of Conduct is in force for elections and I won’t make any announcements. I have conducted an aerial survey and seen that there is drinking water problem in Kalaburagi city and rural areas and drinking water is being supplied through tankers. I have directed the officials to ensure that there was no drinking water problem,” said the Chief Minister.

“Officials have told me that power supply was disrupted as electricity poles have fallen due to rain. The repair work is on and the power supply would be restored shortly. I have also directed the officials to take up road repair works wherever roads suffered damage in the rain and floods. I have told them to take stringent precautions to prevent the outbreak of any disease,” Mr. Yediyurappa said.

121,2020/10/21,"COVID-19: Over 1.3 billion students hit by closure of schools, colleges, says VC","University of Mysore Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar on Wednesday said 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion students and youth across the globe had been affected by the closure of schools, colleges and universities over the COVID-19 pandemic.

Presiding over the inaugural function of Rashtriya Uchhathar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA)-funded video conference hall, refresher course in commerce and release of online adaption of the book “Purana Nama Chudamani” at the UGC-Human Resource Development Centre at the University of Mysore, he said most governments in the world have temporarily closed educational institutions to contain the spread of the pandemic. The nationwide closures of educational institutions had affected 72 per cent of the world’s student population.

He said the challenges for commerce and management educators post-COVID-19 are multifold as any changes in the economic order of the world directly impacts business, commerce and trade. And the business educators must revisit their approach in order to be in tune with the growing uncertainties, technological shifts in teaching and learning process and social shifts in the student population.

In the new normal situation post-COVID-19, the ongoing crisis is forcing business educators to critically question their syllabi. “The reliance on one global market, economic rationality and standardised approach to organisational governance and accountability leaves us vulnerable.”

Prof. Kumar said human strength comes from diversity – ideas, systems, economies and people – and business education syllabi will need to evolve to provide such diversity. “We need to develop and deliver courses that help decision makers deal with complex problems and uncertainty.”

The VC said virtual and remote education will continue to increase. This will ideally increase access to students while reducing some of their costs to participate. “We can shape the evolving educational landscape to help business leaders of the future make better decisions that enable the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals.”

The interconnectedness of the world economy visible in this time of crisis will probably necessitate teaching more systematically, and in greater detail about foreign economies. Business education will need to give more space to teaching about societal impacts and humanistic concerns, he opined.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-over-13-billion-students-hit-by-closure-of-schools-colleges-says-vc/article32909925.ece
122,2020/10/21,Stakeholders for early expansion of Mysuru airport,"Runway extension necessary for the purpose

Stakeholders seeking additional air connectivity from Mysuru to other cities in Karnataka and the neighbouring States have averred that it was imperative to spur investment in the city and expedite industrial development of the region.

But for long-haul flights to operate to and from Mysuru, the extension of the runway was necessary and though the project has received clearance from the Director General of Civil Aviation, it was yet to commence.

The meeting convened by Mysore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) on Tuesday, was addressed by the Mysuru Airport Director Manjunath who said the originating air passenger traffic potential from Mysuru was high and this was the key question posed to him by airlines keen to include the city in their flight path.

He said the air service to Mangaluru by Alliance Air and which will commence in due course was preceded by a series of meetings the focus of which was on passenger potential. Referring to the underpass which was imperative to extend the runway, he said the concept was not novel and such runways existed in different parts of the world.

Apart from Mysuru’s tourism potential, the city was known for yoga, education and adventure sports and this could be harnessed to drive more traffic to the city apart from the potential for new industries.

In this context Mr. Manjunath said that Tatas had identified Nagpur and Mysuru for major investment in the field of aerospace engineering which could generate at least 2,000 jobs but the airport expansion was a must for it to materialise.

Sudhakar Shetty, past president, Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI), said upgrading the Mysuru airport would not only benefit the city but foster development and growth in Mandya, Kodagu, and Chamarajanagar districts as well. He urged the authorities to expedite the land acquisition process to commence the underpass works at the earliest.

This was followed by an interaction with participants most of whom complained of frequent cancellation of flights operating under UDAN. They said passengers lacked confidence about regular flights due to frequent changes in timings and cancellations as a result of which many preferred to fly from Bengaluru.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/stakeholders-for-early-expansion-of-mysuru-airport/article32909811.ece

124,2020/10/21,Row over naming of circle after late corporator,"Mysuru MP Pratap Simha and Mayor Tasneem cross swords over the issue

Mysuru City Corporation’s decision to name a circle after late Congress corporator Ananthu has sparked a row with Mysuru MP Pratap Simha and Mayor Tasneem crossing swords over the issue.

After the MCC Council, at its meeting earlier this month, resolved to name the circle situated near Lalitha Mahal-T .Narispur Road junction after Ananthu, Mr. Simha shot off a letter to MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde terming the resolution “illegal” on the grounds that the circle was situated on National Highway 766 that does not fall under the civic body’s purview.

He contended that City Corporations, City Municipal Councils or Town Municipalities do not have jurisdiction to name a circle that fell under the purview of National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and asked the MCC Commissioner to immediately drop the move.

But, Mayor Tasneem, responding to the MP’s demand, said that Mr. Simha himself had approached the MCC twice with recommendations to name the circle after a late doctor. “Didn’t he know that the circle was part of the NHAI when he himself had approached the MCC with a recommendation to name the circle after the late doctor?”, the Mayor questioned.

Late Ananthu’s wife Ashwini Ananthu, who is now a corporator representing ward number number 37 in MCC, contended that the resolution to name the circle after her late husband was moved after recommendations were received from not only former corporator of the area Mahadevamma, but also several others including office-bearers of Siddhartha Sports Club and Ganapathi temple.

She said Mr. Simha too had made a recommendation to name the circle after late Dr. Satish Rai. But, after a discussion in the council, a resolution was adopted to name the circle after Mr. Ananthu with the support of members of both Congress and JD(S), she said while pointing out that Mr. Ananthu had died while he was member of the MCC.

Reacting to Mr. Simha’s letter, Ms. Ashwini Ananthu said the MP’s letter had questioned the authority of the MCC, which had adopted a resolution in favour naming the circle after Mr. Ananthu. “Does it mean that the MCC’s resolution and the Mayor’s ruling have no authority?”, she asked.

Mr. Simha, in his letter, has also said that the MCC, by adopting the resolution, had thrown to the winds the convention of naming circles after eminent persons, freedom fighters and achievers in memory of their sacrifices to the country.

Also, before naming a circle, the MCC should follow the guidelines issued by the Department of Municipal Administration, Mr .Simha said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/row-over-naming-of-circle-after-late-corporator/article32909508.ece
125,2020/10/21,Carnatic vocalist T.S. Ramaa no more,"Renowned Carnatic vocalist T.S. Ramaa passed away in Bengaluru late on Monday night.

The 70-year-old musician, an A-Top grade artiste of All India Radio, taught music at APS College till she retired 10 years ago, and later joined Jain University, Bangalore, where she set up the postgraduate department in music.

R.K. Padmanabha, Carnatic vocalist, described her as a “Satwik musician” who dedicated her life to music with a spiritual bent of mind.

Trained under several gurus, Ramaa was known for her varied repertoire and penchant for learning till the end. “If a young student sang well, she would immediately want to learn the kriti from that person. Ramaa was always thirsting to learn,” recalled Mr. Padmanabha. When in Mysuru, she lived with guru V. Ramarathnam like his daughter. In the later years, she learnt from Jayam-Bhagyam, sisters of the late percussionist T.A.S Mani, and from Bangarpete Krishnamurthy. She also learnt from the late Seethalakshmi Venkatesan and L.S. Narayanaswamy Bhagavathar.

With a silky voice that had a malleable quality, she sang with devotion. Always on the path of tradition, ragas such as Punnagavarali, Kamach, Varali, and Bhairavi came alive in her voice. “She was a simple person and her music was simple and beautiful too,” says Chairman of Sangeeta Nritya Academy, musician Anoor Ananthakrishna Sharma. “Even in class, she was extremely honest and sincere,” recalls Mr. Sharma who was Ramaa’s student in APS College.

Echoing his opinion, Mr. Padmanabha said: “She never ventured into the unknown. She was meticulous and neat in her presentations.” Ramaa respected her fellow musicians and was always generous in complimenting them.

Ramaa never hankered for fame and publicity. “Not once did she complain that she never got her due. When I was chairman of the Sangeeta Nritya Academy as well as the Ganakala Parishath, we conferred awards on her. She was very happy that the honours came her way.” Her concerts, Mr. Sharma says, were like buffet lunches. They would have a wide variety catering to all kinds of audience tastes. Since she had been trained under several gurus, her repertoire was huge. She also had the ability to choose and plan her concerts appropriately.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/carnatic-vocalist-ts-ramaa-no-more/article32909068.ece

This festival is being conducted by Sahaja Samruddha in association with ASHA-Kisan Swaraj, Bharat Beej Swaraj Manch and Save Our Rice Campaign.

Krishnaprasad of Sahaja Samruddha said almost 10 months of the year has been lost due to the pandemic and the lockdown and no seminar or conference could be held all these days. But as more and more people are shifting to the virtual mode and are working online, it was thought fit to harness this medium and bring together all the stakeholders.

He said the seed diversity festival will have a slew of resource persons from across the country.

“Dasara is a festival which has various practices that are connected to seeds and seed testing rituals in different parts of the country. In these COVID times, we decided to do an online version of a seed festival since it also coincides with the beginning of Rabi season planning”, said Mr. Krishna Prasad.

Though the 2-day festival will seek to share knowledge, it could even share seed resources subsequently. The organisers said seed savers from different States will participate and the focus will be on traditional seed diversity of rice, millets, vegetables etc.

The keynote address will be delivered by Kuldeep Singh, Director of National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources. There will also be a live demonstration of cooking traditional culinary delights using the seeds.

Resource persons include scientists and seed conservationists from across the country who will share information and speak on topics such as rescuing India’s rice diversity from extinction, black rice of Manipur, cultivating rice diversity, and popularising millets besides covering topics such as diet, diversity and immunity.

Sources said the PCR tests saw an upsurge after they were made mandatory for the participants of Dasara inaugural here last week. As a precaution, following the advice of COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), the authorities subjected the participants (who had been permitted to attend) to the PCR method of testing 48 hours before the inaugural event since these tests were considered confirmatory in nature.

RT-PCR negative test report (done after October 14) should be made mandatory for COVID-19 safety at the Dasara venues. The test for officials, staff, security personnel, media persons, artists and others should be made compulsory, the TAC had recommended.

Crucial period

Also, the PCR tests may go up again ahead of the finale this weekend with the participants, including those who had been tested last week, having to provide their swabs under this method.

The RATs may also go up this week with the launch of mobile testing booths in view of the festive season. Mass testing in factories/industries had been arranged for free.

The RAT had achieved 200 per cent of its target between October 7 and 13 but it could achieve 100 per cent target last week. Despite having over 22 centres where the RATs are done for free besides PHCs, the tests did not exceed the target.

Does this indicate not many people are making use of the testing facilities after the fall in the weekly positivity rate? In the last seven days, Mysuru has reported 2,820 new cases, a significant fall, may be by 50 per cent, when compared to new infections in September and cases reported early this month.

At a press conference in Hubballi on Tuesday, he said that as the members of the community were ‘soft-natured and hard working’, their rightful demand had been neglected by successive governments.

“Only 5% of the community is rich, while the remaining are economically and socially backward. For most of them, agriculture is the main occupation and several earn their livelihood as farm workers,” he said.

129,2020/10/21,Yatnal’s remarks bring discontent to fore again,"‘BJP old-timers feel left out as outsiders have cornered many posts’

Though senior BJP leader Basanagouda Patil Yatnal is known to make sweeping and controversial statements, his remarks that Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa’s tenure is set to end soon have brought to the fore the simmering discontent among party old-timers who are waiting for a change of guard.

“The party’s old-timers feel that they are left out as outsiders have cornered a sizeable number of Ministerial posts. There is no other way as the government was formed due to their defections. But this has become a cause of dissatisfaction among old timers,” observed a party State leader.

“Mr. Yatnal’s remarks are an indication that several leaders in the BJP especially those from his own Lingayat community are hoping to get a Chief Ministerial opportunity if there is a leadership change,” observed another prominent leader in BJP State unit. Mr. Yatnal’s comments come in the run-up to the bypolls and biennial polls to the Council.

Though several senior leaders sought to immediately clarify that leadership change is not on agenda, none of them took Mr. Yatnal to task, but for those in Mr. Yediyurappa’s camp.

Newly-appointed BJP National General Secretary C.T. Ravi ruled out any leadership change and said Mr. Yediyurappa was the party’s unanimous choice for the post. Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan said, “Mr. Yediyurappa is our leader and he will continue as CM.”

On his part, CM’s political secretary M.P. Renukacharya launched a counter attack on Mr. Yatnal. “He is daydreaming of becoming CM. But the chief ministerial post is not vacant. Such views are personal and issued out of selfishness. They are not the views of legislators of North Karnataka,” Mr. Renukacharya said and warned that the party would take suitable action against those issuing such statements on leadership change.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/30rn7c/article32904842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BGYATNAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yatnals-remarks-bring-discontent-to-fore-again/article32904843.ece

131,2020/10/21,EPIC data: DEO told to submit report in 24 hours,"Congress leaders meet CEO and lodge complaint against BJP candidate

The Chief Electoral Officer, Karnataka, has directed the District Electoral Officer (DEO) and BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad to inquire into allegations of voters in Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly segment being coerced into divulging details of voters’ ID cards and submit a report within 24 hours.

This was after several Congress leaders, led by former MP V.S. Ugrappa, met with CEO Sanjiv Kumar and lodged a formal complaint against the BJP’s candidate in R.R Nagar Muniratha Naidu, seeking his disqualification from the election. The bypoll to this Assembly constituency is scheduled on November 3.

Mr. Ugrappa maintained that the Congress had proof that the BJP was collecting EPIC (electoral photo identity cards) from voters of poor socio-economic groups and minority communities. “We have received in writing from some voters that they were forced to handover their cards and that they were given ₹5,000 in exchange. Nearly 5,000 such cards have been so far collected by the BJP agents,” he charged and stated that this clearly showed that BJP was employing coercion and threats in the segment.

He also pointed out that this was the same modus operandi that Mr. Munirathna had employed in the previous Assembly polls held in May 2018. “After more than 9,500 EPICs were seized from an apartment in Jalahalli, coming under R.R. Assembly constituency, several cases were registered against Mr. Munirathna,” he said.

In May 2018, Mr. Munirathna contested on a Congress ticket. Asked why the party did not initiate any action against him then, Mr. Ugrappa claimed that Congress “believed the allegations were politically motivated.”

The Congress has now demanded that the CEO direct the authorities concerned to register an FIR against the BJP candidate, his agents and others involved in collecting voters’ details, apart from initiating steps for the conduct of free and fair polls.

Despite several attempts, Mr. Munirathna was unavailable for comment. However, Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan, reacting to Congress’ allegation, claimed the party was trying to divert public attention by creating an episode of collecting EPIC by unknown persons.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/epic-data-deo-told-to-submit-report-in-24-hours/article32904835.ece
132,2020/10/21,Karnataka sees dip in COVID-19 cases,"Following a significant rise in the State’s testing capacity, Karnataka is now among five States whose active cases have seen a considerable drop in the past few days.

While Maharashtra has seen the highest reduction (of 9,210 active cases), Karnataka’s drop of 3,050 was the second highest as on Monday.

The number of daily new positive cases too has reduced in the past one week. Karnataka, which reported over 10,000 cases consistently for the first 13 days of October, saw the numbers come down to around 7,500 daily. While the number came down to 5,018 on Monday, it was 6,297 on Tuesday.

While officials attributed this to increased testing — over one lakh samples a day continuously for the past 19 days — sources said some test results were “deliberately” being delayed to show a reduction in numbers. In September, when an average of 65,000 tests were conducted daily, around 8,500 cases were being reported per day.

The State’s average Test Positivity Rate (TPR), which had touched 13% in August and September, reduced to 9% in October. Tuesday’s TPR stood at 6.41%, while the Case Fatality Rate touched 1.04%.

Festival season crucial

Doctors, who said that the drop in cases was an all-India trend, asserted that people should not become complacent now.

V. Ravi, senior professor and head of Neuro Virology at NIMHANS, who is also part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said, “We need to see this trend continuing for another one week to 10 days before we call it a decline. It is all the more important for people to safeguard themselves during the festival season.”

C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State’s COVID-19 task force, said this was a crucial transition period. “We should not get carried away by the decline in numbers and become casual. People should continue following precautions and not become callous during the festival season. Always in distress whenever there is complacency, a rebound can happen,” he said.

6,297 cases, 66 deaths

Karnataka on Tuesday reported 6,297 new COVID-19 cases, taking the total number of cases to 7,76,901. With 66 new deaths, the toll rose to 10,608. This is apart from 19 deaths of COVID-19 patients caused by other reasons.

As many as 8,500 persons were discharged on Tuesday, taking the total number of recoveries to 6,62,329.

133,2020/10/21,"‘Shivakumar, Siddaramaiah conspired to bring down coalition government’","The Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday accused Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar and Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah of being responsible for the collapse of the coalition government led by H.D. Kumaraswamy.

Speaking at a press conference, Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan said the BJP would soon release audio evidence in this regard. This was part of the party’s counter attack against the Congress leaders who have accused the BJP candidate in the by-poll to Rajarajeshwarinagar constituency, Mr. Munirathna, of migrating to the saffron party from the Congress for monetary gains.

The Deputy Chief Minister said Mr. Munirathna had not taken any money or favour from the BJP for joining its fold. He had joined the BJP “at the behest of Congress leaders who had conspired to bring down the coalition government” by sending out MLAs from their party, he said. He accused Mr. Shivakumar of “backstabbing” Mr. Kumaraswamy while projecting himself as his close associate.

Interestingly, though Mr. Munirathna was present at the press conference, he desisted from commenting on the issue. Speaking on his behalf, Mr. Ashwath Narayan said more things would come out in this regard in the future.

He maintained that the Opposition parties were not prepared for the by-polls as they were under the impression that the legal issue over holding the by-polls would not be resolved. Hence the Opposition parties were levelling the allegations against Mr. Munirathna to cover up for their lack of preparation for the polls, he alleged.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/shivakumar-siddaramaiah-conspired-to-bring-down-coalition-government/article32904351.ece

135,2020/10/21,CPI cagey about Mani’s inclusion in LDF,"Kanam says coalition will take a final call after an LDF meeting today.

The Communist Party of India (CPI) refused to declare openly on Wednesday whether it would welcome the Jose. K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) into the Left Democratic Front (LDF) fold.

CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran, who chaired a crucial meeting of the party’s State executive here, said an announcement about the future of Mr. Mani on the eve of the LDF conclave would be extremely untimely.

“The CPI has not welcomed Mr. Mani outright. It has attempted to weigh the changes Mr. Mani’s shift in allegiance to the LDF has brought about on the political field. The CPI would state its case at the LDF meeting on Thursday. The party has a positive approach to all issues. It would not let go of an opportunity to weaken the opposition UDF,” Mr. Rajendran added.

Mani untested

Mr. Rajendran said the CPI was under no impression that Mr. Mani’s possible inclusion in the front would “abruptly reverse the course of the Meenachal river.” Mr. Mani’s purported strength in Central Travancore remained untested in the changed situation.

Local body polls

The CPI was singularly focussed on steering the LDF to victory in the local body elections in December. Assembly polls would come only later. He refused to state whether Mr. Mani’s likely inclusion in the LDF was subject to any timetable.

The CPI felt that Mr. Mani’s abandonment of the UDF had weakened the Opposition considerably. The party saw no rationale for opposing Mr. Mani.

The Kerala Congress (M) leader has declared his support for the pro-farmer policies of the LDF. He has unconditionally accepted the LDF’s political programme, Mr. Rajendran said.

The CPI has always balanced its ideological moorings with the practicalities of realpolitik. It has done so without compromising its values, he said.

Flays Congress

The Congress has abandoned its secular position and lurched to the right. It has aligned with the Bharatiya Janata Party to discredit the government, Mr. Rajendran said.

At the same time, the Congress has opened secret parleys with the Welfare Party of India and Jamaat-e-Islami to disadvantage the LDF in the election year.

Mr. Mani’s desertion of the UDF has offered the LDF an opportunity for undermining the cabal, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/re4777/article27906301.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KANAMRAJENDRAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cpi-cagey-about-manis-inclusion-in-ldf/article32911839.ece
136,2020/10/21,Exemptions likely in ban on tree-felling,"Team formed to mark areas where eucalyptus can be cut

IDUKKI The issue of permission for felling eucalyptus at Vattavada, Kanthallur, and Kottakambur villages may find a solution with District Collector H.Dinesan forming a team of revenue, forest, and survey officials to mark the areas for giving exemption from a blanket ban on tree-felling imposed in Devikulam taluk.

The ban was imposed as per a report submitted by the then Principal Secretary, Land Revenue, Nivedita P. Haran in 2015.

A large area of Vattavada, the main cool-season vegetable cultivating village, was under eucalyptus cultivation and the government last year gave permission to fell trees on private land after submitting an application with proper documents to the village offices.

It had been found that eucalyptus cultivation resulted in depletion of groundwater and reduced the area of vegetable cultivation at Vattavada and Kanthallur. The blanket ban on cutting trees had affected the livelihood of people and efforts to bring back the area under vegetable cultivation.

A major issue was that farmers did not get the benefit as only a few of them had title deed or proper documents to apply for the permission to cut eucalyptus. A recent meeting took note of the issue and it was decided to form a special team for land verification. The Collector had also asked village officers to give immediate permission for felling eucalyptus on land with proper documents.

The Forest Department had earlier objected to the move to lift the ban fearing that trees on forestland would also be felled under the cover of permission for felling eucalyptus on private land.

A forest official said Vattavada and Kanthallur were surrounded by forests and trees there would be felled if permission was given to cut eucalyptus on private land. A revenue official said as a large number of farmers at Vattavada did not have proper land documents, they did not benefit from the relaxation of the ban on tree felling.

Devikulam Subcollector S. Prem Krishnan said it was decided to conduct the survey in a time frame. It would help in identifying the land inherited by farmers and getting the benefits of relaxation on tree felling in Devikulam taluk.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/exemptions-likely-in-ban-on-tree-felling/article32911835.ece

Popular as ‘Zero Babu’, he was ailing for long owing to age-related illnesses. He earned the attention of music lovers for his drama songs early in his career.

138,2020/10/21,Buffalo calves to be distributed to famers,"Ithikkara first block panchayat in Kollam to launch project

Ithikkara has become the first block panchayat in the district to distribute male buffalo calves as part of ‘Buffalo Village’ project. The project, being implemented in connection with the State government’s Subhiksha Keralam initiative, aims at providing livelihood to farmers while ensuring availability of quality meat. A total of 125 persons belonging to economically backward Scheduled Caste community residing in the five panchayats under the block are the beneficiaries of the project. The block panchayat has also arranged insurance for the beneficiaries with 75% subsidy.

Low maintenance

Buffalo farming is considered an ideal option by many farmers as it requires minimal infrastructure. “Buffalo meat has high demand in market and the usual livestock diseases do not normally spread among the herd. A nine-month calf will gain five times its weight in six months and can be auctioned for a higher price,” said an official.

Profitable

The calves also require very little maintenance as they can be left at marshy places for grazing. “Green fodder is the main diet and they do not demand any regular care regime like other cattle. Buffalo rearing is a very profitable option for livestock farmers and there is also an exclusive market for buffalo meat,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/u73hd6/article32911570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/pothu-gramam-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/buffalo-calves-to-be-distributed-to-famers/article32911551.ece
139,2020/10/21,Govt. drops decision to cut salary,"Deducted salary will be given in April, 2021

The State government has finally given up its decision to deduct one month’s salary of government employees and teachers to overcome the financial crisis induced by COVID-19 pandemic.

A Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday decided to merge the six-days’ salary deducted for five months from April to August this year in the Provident Fund (PF) on April 1, 2021.

The government will give interest as per PF rules for the amount being merged, but will allow withdrawal of the same amount only after June 1, 2021. For pensioners and those who do not have a PF account, the deducted salary (20% of the monthly salary) will be given in equal instalments from June 1, 2021.

The State which needs ₹2,500 crore to pay the monthly salary of employees cannot afford another ₹2,500 crore and hence the decision to merge the deducted salary in the PF account, a communication from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said.

The decision comes in the wake of the directive of the CPI(M) State secretariat to Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac in view of the forthcoming elections to the local bodies, and the announcement of the pro-UDF unions that they would seek legal measures and resort to agitation if the government went ahead with the salary cut.

141,2020/10/21,Kerala fixes base prices for 16 agricultural items,"It will come into force in the State from November 1

Base prices for 16 agricultural items, including vegetables, fruits and tubers, will come into force in the State from November 1, Keralapiravi day.

The Cabinet on Wednesday cleared the proposal to introduce the base prices designed to protect farmers from adverse price fluctuations in the market. The government has termed the initiative as the first of its kind in the country.

The base price has been arrived at by calculating the production cost plus 20% on the basis of a study conducted by the State Agricultural Prices Board. To curb malpractice, the government has also fixed a ceiling for per-hectare productivity for each of the items.

The base prices (a kg) are as follows: tapioca (₹12), Nendran banana/Wayanadan Nendran (₹30/₹24), pineapple (₹15), ash gourd (₹9), cucumber (₹8), bitter gourd (₹30), snake gourd (₹30), string beans (₹34), tomato (₹8), ladies' finger (₹20), cabbage (₹11), carrot (₹21), potato (₹20), beans (₹28), beet root (₹21) and garlic (₹139).

In the event of the market prices of the aforementioned items falling below the base price in a district, a district-level committee will declare the base price as having come into force in that district. The quality of produce will be a criterion.

To become eligible, farmers have to upload the area of their farmland, data on sowing, expected harvest and harvest time before the season on the web portal www.aims.kerala.gov.in. The AIMS mobile app is downloadable from Google Play Store. They should also avail themselves of crop insurance. A farmer will be eligible for base price for a maximum of 15 acres in a season.

The Agriculture Department has joined hands with the Local Self-Government Department and the Cooperation Department to introduce the pricing, Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar said.

142,2020/10/21,Rahul Gandhi lauds State’s efforts to combat pandemic,"MP inaugurates arthroscopic surgery unit and ICU ventilator at district hospital

Congress leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi has appreciated the selfless efforts put forth by health workers in Kerala to combat the spread of COVID-19.

Opening the new arthroscopic surgery unit and ICU ventilator at the Wayanad District Hospital on Wednesday, he said Kerala had made commendable efforts in controlling the spread of the pandemic.

The arthroscopic surgery unit and the ICU ventilator were set up at a cost of ₹26.5 lakh and ₹11.2 lakh respectively under Mr. Gandhi’s local development fund. O.R. Kelu, MLA, presided over the event.

Later, the MP made a visit to the paddy fields of Thirunelli Agro Produce Company and interacted with traditional farmers, including Cheruvayal Raman, noted indigenous paddy conservator, who had been mentioned by Mr. Gandhi in a recent tweet.

He said he would do his best to find global market for indigenous paddy varieties.

143,2020/10/21,Cabinet nod for 10% quota in govt. jobs,"This is for economically weaker sections in the general category

The Cabinet has approved a 10% reservation in government jobs for the economically backward sections in the general category and who are not eligible for any other reservation.

The Kerala State and Subordinate Services Rules will be amended to include the new reservation and it will come into effect from the date of notification. The decision was taken at a Cabinet meeting here on Wednesday.

The Centre had earlier decided to give 10% reservation in government jobs and for admission in the educational institutions for the economically weaker sections in the general category based on the 103rd Amendment of the Constitution, an official communication from the Chief Minister’s Office said.

At present, 50% reservation is being provided to the SC/ST and Backward communities. The 10% reservation announced on Wednesday was from the general category and would not affect the existing quota for SC/ST and Backward communities.

In December last year, the government had approved the report of the K. Sreedharan Nair Commission recommending 10% reservation in government jobs for the economically weaker sections among the forward communities. The Cabinet gave the nod for the report with amendments mooted by the Law Department.

In August this year, the Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) had approved the government directive regarding the 10% economic reservation. This reservation will be applicable for appointments to all departments and public sector institutions.

Candidates from families that have an annual income of less than ₹4 lakh will be eligible for this reservation. Job aspirants belonging to families that possess more than 2 acres of land in grama panchayats or more than 75 cents in municipalities or more than 50 cents in Corporation limits will not be eligible.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cabinet-nod-for-10-quota-in-govt-jobs/article32910258.ece
144,2020/10/21,"e-scooter, e-rickshaw from KAL soon","Demand for three-seater ‘Kerala Neem G’ autorickshaws spurs move

The public sector Kerala Automobiles Limited (KAL) is to give a big push to State’s e-mobility journey by launching e-scooter, e-goods auto rickshaw, and e-rickshaw from its plant at Aralumoodu in the capital.

The KAL’s foray into personal mobility and other arenas comes in the wake of the demand for three-seater environment-friendly ‘Kerala Neem G’ autorickshaws launched by it from even outside the country. The KAL is the first PSU in the country to foray into the e-mobility business and the aim is to build on it.

The KAL has begun steps to roll out e-scooter, e-goods auto rickshaw, and the e-rickshaw after carrying out the feasibility. While the e-goods autorickshaw can be rolled out from the existing platform for e-auto, a new platform is needed for the e-rickshaw and the e-scooter. The modern machine shop set up on the KAL premises for ₹7 crore will come in handy for the new projects.

Efficiency and cost

The five seater e-rickshaw, to be rolled out for travel on the level roads and for city ride, is to run 80 km with one charging. While the price of the e-auto is ₹2.85 lakh, the e-rickshaw will be sold for ₹2 lakh.

The e-goods auto rickshaw will also run for 80 to 90 km with one charging. It will be able to ferry up to 600 kg of goods and will be priced below ₹3 lakh. The State road network would have environment-friendly e-goods autos replacing the conventional auto rickshaws in the near future in tune with the introduction of e-autos in three major cities.

The e-scooter and e-goods auto are to be launched in two months. The KAL is planning two variants of the e-scooter in March 2021, both will cost less than ₹75,000, KAL managing director A. Shajahan told The Hindu. The e-scooter will be a good alternative to traditional petrol scooters and it will offer great torque, speed, comfort, and performance. “We are rolling out an e-scooter equivalent to a 100cc conventional scooter and this will address the speed issue,” he said.

Indigenously made batteries using German technology can be charged within three hours and 55 minutes. Charging can be done using a three-pin plug in households that have single-phase connection for the upcoming e-scooter, e-rickshaw, and e-goods auto rickshaw.

The KAL’s plant that can now roll out 7,200 e-autos annually will soon be upgraded to manufacture 15,000 e-autos. e-autos will soon hit the streets in large numbers in Kerala as 17 dealers have been appointed. KAL is also taking steps to expand its Kerala-Neem G network outside the State, the MD said.

The initiative is part of the target of putting one million electric vehicles on the road by 2022, with a ‘pilot fleet’ of two lakh two-wheelers, 50,000 three-wheelers, 1,000 goods carriers, 3,000 buses, and 100 ferry boats by 2020.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dj4yl5/article32912546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Auto,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/e-scooter-e-rickshaw-from-kal-soon/article32910236.ece
145,2020/10/21,Kerala firm rolls out indigenous RT-PCR test kits,"Company offers to deliver kits anywhere across State within 4 to 5 hours

A Kerala-based company, TCM Ltd, has rolled out on a commercial scale ‘Covi-DetecT’, its brand of RT-PCR test kits based on technology developed by IIT Delhi.

TCM Ltd, which was a chemical company until recently, was among the six firms chosen by IIT Delhi to commercialise its technology. Announcing the development, Joseph Varghese, Managing Director of TCM Ltd, said that the company’s unit at Kinfra Biotechnology and Industrial Zone in Kochi has reached a capacity for 100 kits translating into 10,000 tests daily, which will be further augmented in a week’s time to roll out 500 kits (50,000 tests) per day.

He said that at present, Kerala is entirely dependent on supply of test kits from other States and it takes anywhere between 48 to 72 hours, sometimes even more time, for the kits to reach the State through a dry-ice packed journey. “In such cases, chances of quality deterioration are comparatively higher as against our capability to deliver the Kerala-made kits within 4 to 5 hours anywhere across the State. COVID 19 (RT-PCR) test kits are to be kept under minus 20° Celsius at all times and any variation will affect quality. Also, local labs are not required to stock the test kits in big quantities now, as they are made in their vicinity. There will be price advantages too,” he said.

“We are ready to sell Covi-DetecT to the government at near-cost prices and join the bandwagon to fight the dreaded disease,” he said.

Manju Abraham, Chief Scientific Officer of TCM Healthcare Pvt Ltd, a fully-owned subsidiary of TCM Ltd, said the RT-PCR assay developed by IIT-Delhi is by far the surest method available in India as it identifies the presence of the virus by analysing the RNA coding for spike glycoprotein, which is a protein expressed on the viral surface. “The biggest advantage of our test kit is that it also checks a human gene [GAPDH] along with the viral gene in the test and thus identifies any sample insufficiency which could have occurred due to improper sample collection, sample transport or RNA isolation,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1nuavv/article32377513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12IN-PCR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-firm-rolls-out-indigenous-rt-pcr-test-kits/article32910181.ece
146,2020/10/21,Sivasankar aware of all activities of Swapna: ED,"Agency opposes anticipatory bail plea of Sivasankar

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday informed the Kerala High Court that M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, had actively participated in various activities with Swapna Suresh and others who are accused of committing various offences, including the one under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).

Opposing the anticipatory bail plea of Mr. Sivasankar, the ED sought permission of the court to hand over the materials so far collected against Mr. Sivasankar in a sealed cover to the court. In a statement filed in the court, the ED said that it might require the custodial interrogation of Mr. Sivasankar at an appropriate stage depending upon the investigation.

The statement was filed in response to an anticipatory bail petition filed by Mr. Sivasankar The court will consider the case on October 23.

The statement said that Mr. Sivasankar had deposed before the ED that he had instructed his Chartered Accountant Venugopal Iyer to help Swapna to manage her finances. Mr. Sivasankar asked him to open a joint locker with Swapna and they later opened it.

Mr. Venugopal had further revealed that Mr. Sivasankar and Swapna reached his office one day with a bag full of money worth ₹30 lakh. Mr. Venugopal was hesitant to handle such huge amount of cash. However, Swapna had tried to convince him that the cash came from genuine sources and had asked him to keep the amount in the locker.

WhatsApp messages between Mr. Sivasankar and Mr. Venugopal had revealed that the latter had informed Mr. Sivasankar regarding the deposits and withdrawal from bank locker of Swapna. When Mr. Sivasankar was confronted with these facts during questioning, he had remained evasive and had stated that he never directed Mr. Venugopal to open bank locker in the name of Swapna. During the search by NIA, ₹64 lakh had been seized from the locker and ₹36.50 lakh from another locker at Federal Bank, Thiruvananthapuram.

The statement said that WhatsApp chat between Mr. Sivasankar and Swapna had disclosed that she had discussed everything with him. Therefore, the agency could not disbelieve his version that he was not aware that Swapna was making money through gold smuggling and by way of kickbacks.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sivasankar-aware-of-all-activities-of-swapna-ed/article32909995.ece
147,2020/10/21,Small units’ Ayurvedic drugs may have harmful metals,"Most such units do no have labs to ensure quality of raw materials, final products

That Ayurveda ‘arishtam’ made by a small manufacturer and available at a neighbourhood store may contain metals harmful to your health. It is better to be careful before gulping it down as an immune booster to contain COVID-19.

For, the State government does not have a mechanism to regulate the sale of herbal raw materials that are used to make Ayurvedic medicines. According to officials in the Drugs Control Department, anyone with a licence issued by the civic body can set up a store to sell them. Officials cannot check the premises or the quality of the herbs. Truckloads of medicinal plants are coming from other States as well.

Contaminated roots

N. Vimala, former Deputy Drugs Controller in charge of Ayurveda, told The Hindu on Wednesday that herbal roots that are essential components in certain ‘arishtams’ were found to have high content of metals such as lead and mercury. “Because of severe air and soil pollution, these roots could be contaminated. The manufacturers are supposed to wash them thoroughly and then dry them before use. However, only the big players in the Ayurveda industry bother to do so,” she pointed out.

The big players

It is mandatory for manufacturers who have Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificate to have in-house labs to ensure the quality of raw materials and final products. “But the equipment for heavy metal analysis are costly and smaller firms may not be able to afford them. So they outsource it to other places and the quality is compromised,” Dr. Vimala said.

Sources in the department also claimed that there aren’t enough staff to inspect the quality of drugs. Big manufacturing units such as Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala and government-controlled Oushadhi have their own system to check the quality of the medicinal plants and herbs, but hundreds of smaller players do not have any such facility.

‘Make registration must’

Dr. Vimala said she had submitted a proposal to the government during her stint in the department, making registration mandatory for raw material stores as well as Ayurveda pharmacy outlets. The report also contained suggestions to have district-wise mechanism to check the quality of the raw materials. However, the proposal is still in cold storage.

Meanwhile, it is learnt that the government is planning to consult experts and stakeholders in the industry to frame guidelines on the issue.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/small-units-ayurvedic-drugs-may-have-harmful-metals/article32909678.ece
148,2020/10/21,An unforgettable virtual moment,"COVID-19 patient watches daughter’s wedding on laptop of another patient at FLTC

COVID-19 scripted an unforgettable virtual moment in the life of T.P. Narayanan, an ex-serviceman from Kozhikode’s Kakkodi village, on Wednesday. The man who was helpless to attend his daughter’s wedding owing to the infection accomplished it the virtual way using the laptop of another patient at a first-line treatment centre (FLTC) in the city.

“It was on October 11 that I reached Kozhikode from Goa with the sole intention of organising my eldest daughter’s wedding. As it was the first such event in our family, I had secured sufficient leave from my new employer. We never thought that it would end up like this,” said Mr. Narayanan. He said he was least aware of the scope of watching it live, but it was made possible with the help of a youth from Vadakara.

Days of uncertainty

The date of the wedding had been rescheduled many times owing to the unexpected challenges related to the stringent COVID-19 protocols and containment zone regulations. Mr. Narayanan too had rescheduled his leave in such a way to do the arrangements for the wedding in advance. He said the unexpected test result came last Friday and it was quite a disappointing moment for all.

Mr. Narayanan said the family members, including the newlywed couple and local friends, contacted him many times over the phone and it somehow helped him to manage the situation. There were also a few friends at the FLTC who assisted him to take it in a positive way and enjoy the great moment for the family, he said.

Health Department officials said it would take at least a week more for Mr. Narayanan to get discharged from the treatment centre. “I am perfectly alright now with no visible symptoms or health issues. We will celebrate the moment together after the hospital days,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/an-unforgettable-virtual-moment/article32909666.ece
149,2020/10/21,Integrated facility for sea rescue operations,"A master control room, 3 regional control rooms to collect and interpret disaster data

Sea Rescue and Disaster Management Coordination and Information Centres (SRDMCIC) are to be established in the State for timely forecasting of disasters, to alert the agencies to be prepared for the quick search and rescue operations, and to coordinate with State and Central agencies.

A master control room and three regional control rooms will be set up as part of the new initiative. These control rooms will receive and collect information related to weather forecast, cyclone, tsunami warning, oceanic formations such as potential fishing zones, and wind and wave alert from various agencies.

These facilities will take up the task of interpreting the data received and translate them into local languages by avoiding technical language and jargon. They will have to undertake awareness programmes and preparedness activities between various line agencies.

Henceforth, the control rooms will coordinate the actual search and rescue operations being carried out by various agencies. Timely feedback to the administrators in the State and Centre will also be forwarded.

Gathering of pre- and post-disaster information and compilation of the data for future planning and improvement will be carried out. They will also have to carry out mock drills and training to create awareness and prepare a community-based disaster management plan.

The master control rooms will gather information from the three regional control rooms and coordinate the operations. The liaison with the headquarters of the line departments will be from the master control room.

₹68.20-lakh project

With the working group that met on September 19 clearing the proposal, the government has given the administrative sanction for the Ports and Fisheries Department to go ahead with the project estimated to cost ₹68.20 lakh.

Official sources said the master control room will be set up at a cost of ₹22.90 lakh and the three regional control rooms, for ₹45.30 lakh. The manpower required for the centres will be through redeployment of personnel and procurement through government e-marketing platform.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/article21246609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01kisan01Navy-G0C2VDGU83jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/integrated-facility-for-sea-rescue-operations/article32909562.ece
150,2020/10/21,ED questions IUML leaders in bribery case,"Sanctioning of Plus Two courses for an aided school in Azhikode

Officials attached to the Sub-Zonal Office of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Kozhikode on Wednesday recorded the statement of Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leaders, including State general secretary K.P.A. Majeed and Kannur district general secretary Abdul Kareem Cheleri, in connection with a bribery case of sanctioning Plus Two courses for an aided school at Azhikode in Kannur district in 2014.

The ED is probing the case registered based on Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The case was that Plus Two courses were sanctioned in the school after collecting a bribe from the management. Notices had been earlier issued to 30 persons for either recording their statements or questioning.

The recording of statements of Mr. Majeed and Mr. Cheleri, which began in the morning, continued till the evening, sources said.

It is also learnt that the ED has sent a notice to IUML legislator K.M. Shaji, who represented Azhikode Assembly segment in Kannur district. The bribery case first surfaced when a former IUML local leader Noushad Poothappara raised the allegation. Investigators recorded the statement of Mr. Poothappara on Tuesday.

The ED is expected to question Mr. Shaji in this regard on November 10 and also record the statements of representatives of school management and PTA office-bearers, sources said.

Previously the Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau (VACB) had registered an FIR at the Thalassery court stating that Mr. Shaji had allegedly taken a bribe of ₹25 lakh for allotting Plus Two courses in the aided school in his Assembly segment.

The VACB had taken up the case after local CPI(M) leader and block panchayat president Kuduvan Padmanabhan forwarded a complaint to the Chief Minister.

However, Mr. Shaji had earlier said the case was slapped on him out of political vengeance and that he would fight the case legally and politically.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ed-questions-iuml-leaders-in-bribery-case/article32909531.ece

153,2020/10/21,PMO gives clean chit to Muraleedharan,"Allegation of protocol violation in PR professional’s inclusion in global meet

An inquiry by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has found no substance in a private complaint that the Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan had violated protocol by including a public relations professional as an official delegate in the meeting of Ministers representing the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Council in Abu Dhabi last year.

The petitioner, Saleem Madavoor, had requested the PMO to conduct an inquiry, seeking to know on what ground Mr. Muraleedharan had included the woman on the list of official invitees to the international meeting.

BJP’s version

BJP leader S. Suresh published the PMO’s finding on his FB account. He said an embassy-level investigation in the UAE had called the ‘Communist Party of India (Marxist)’s [CPI(M)] bluff to discredit the Minister.’

The BJP had felt that Mr. Madavoor had tried to draw an equivalency between Mr. Muraleedharan and Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel. The Minister had come under suspicion of protocol violation by receiving aid in the form of food packets and Koran from the UAE consulate here. Dr. Jaleel had termed the ‘Ramzan charity’ a religious and cultural transaction and not a largesse from a foreign potentate as alleged by the BJP.

The PMO’s decision to close the case against Mr. Muraleedharan had set the matter to rest, the BJP said. It had also scotched a bid by the CPI(M) to divert public attention from the government’s alleged links with economic offenders and gold smugglers.

To petition CVC

However, Mr. Madavoor has sworn to pursue the matter further and petition the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) against Mr. Muraleedharan. The PR professional, who is also an office-bearer of the Mahila Morcha, had said she had attended the meeting on her volition and at her expense. She had not participated as a State guest as alleged by the complainant.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pmo-gives-clean-chit-to-muraleedharan/article32909271.ece
154,2020/10/21,Welfare fund board for MGNREGS workers soon,"Govt. to promulgate Ordinance as Bill could not be presented in Assembly due to COVID-19

The State government is planning to promulgate an Ordinance for a welfare fund board for Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) workers. A first such initiative by a State, this would provide them with pension, medical assistance, educational assistance for their children and other benefits.

The welfare fund has been under the government's consideration for the past few months, but with the prevailing COVID-19 situation the Bill could not be presented in the Assembly. Now, the plan is to promulgate an Ordinance to get the scheme started.

The benefits will be for workers who have completed the age of 60 and have paid contributions for not fewer than five years. For those who have paid the contributions for not fewer than 10 years, their families will get the benefits in case of the beneficiary's death. The workers who have completed the age of 60 will be entitled to pension, even though they are allowed to work until the age of 75. The fund also provides medical assistance, educational assistance for children, funds for marriage and also family benefits. The workers will have to pay a nominal monthly amount of around ₹50 as contribution. The detailed rules are being framed.

Curbs may go

""We have 20 lakh active workers under the MGNREGS and they all stand to benefit. In addition, there are around 2 lakh workers in the Ayyankali Employment Guarantee Scheme who can also join in this welfare fund. Those who take part as stop-gap arrangements will not be considered,"" said a source in the Local Self- Government Department.

The government is also planning to remove the pandemic-time restrictions regarding the maximum age of workers permitted to take part in MGNREGS works. After the pandemic began, the maximum age of workers was reduced from 75 to 65 as per an order from the Home Ministry.

""Although we have had several phases of unlocking restrictions, there have not been any mention about this particular one from the Centre. Due to this, many are unable to get work. About one lakh people would be benefited if these restrictions are removed. The State government is considering relaxation of the restriction considering this fact,"" said the source.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ipwmta/article32912538.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22tv-MGNREGScol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/welfare-fund-board-for-mgnregs-workers-soon/article32909086.ece
155,2020/10/21,LDF slams UDF for wooing WPI,"‘Move will lead to further communal polarisation of State’

United Democratic Front (UDF) convener M.M. Hassan’s private parley with Jamaat-e-Islami Amir M.I. Abdul Aziz has drawn sharp criticism from the Left Democratic Front (LDF).

LDF convener A. Vijayaraghavan said Mr. Hassan’s attempt to seek the tacit support of the Islamist organisation ahead of the local body and Assembly elections would give a fillip to Hindu majoritarian forces and underscore the communally polarising political narrative unleashed by the Sangh Parivar in Kerala.

Hassan denies charge

Mr. Hassan has, however, denied the charge. He said his meeting with Mr. Aziz was apolitical. As the UDF convener, he was expected to call on leaders of various organisations and try to find a common ground on diverse social issues. Mr. Hassan also refuted the charge that the UDF had entertained the idea of striking an electoral alliance with Welfare Party of India (WPI).

The CPI(M) had earlier characterised the WPI as a fundamentalist organisation and slammed purported attempts by the UDF, especially the IUML, to ally with it. It had also accused the Congress of wooing the “fundamentalist” SDPI to the UDF fold.

WPI State president Hameed Vaniyambalam had said the party had backed the Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha election as a credible political alternative to the Modi government at the Centre. In the process, the WPI had earned the ire of the CPI(M), which had repeatedly attempted to bracket the party as a communal organisation with extremist links.

Congress leader K. Muraleedharan appeared to acknowledge the purported support extended by the WPI to the UDF in 2019. He seemed to dispute Mr. Hassan's statement by “revealing” that the Congress had engaged the WPI politically ahead of the previous Lok Sabha polls.

K. Sudharakan, MP, also said that the UDF would not reject electoral support from any group. KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said he was not aware of any alliance with the WPI. The political affairs committee of the KPCC has taken no such decision, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ldf-slams-udf-for-wooing-wpi/article32909020.ece
156,2020/10/21,SEC working out norms for safe polling,"For people who test positive or go in quarantine on the eve of local body elections

The State Election Commission (SEC) is trying to work out how people who test positive for COVID-19 or go in quarantine on the eve of the local body elections can be allowed to exercise their franchise safely.

The guidelines issued by the SEC on Wednesday prescribe postal ballots for COVID-19 patients and persons in quarantine. However, there are procedural difficulties involved in issuing postal ballots to people who test positive or in quarantine on the days immediately preceding the elections.

State Election Commissioner V. Bhaskaran told The Hindu that a solution would be worked out through discussions with the Directorate of Health Services.

No proxy voting

At the all-party meeting convened by the SEC on September 18, political parties had shot down a proposal to allow the two groups to assign proxy voters. The parties had asked the SEC to devise a solution.

The other option, allowing patients and the quarantined to cast their votes in the last hour of voting also is fraught with difficulties. Many voters who fall in these categories would be hesitant and it would also entail putting polling officials at risk, say SEC officials.

SEC officials are hoping that the COVID-19 caseload in the State and the number of containment zones would significantly come down by December.

Although the local body elections are due in early December, the SEC has not announced the dates yet. The elections are to be held in two phases.

Elections will be held in 15,962 wards in 941 grama panchayats; 2,080 wards in 152 block panchayats; 331 wards in 14 district panchayats; 3,078 wards in 86 municipalities; and 414 wards in the six municipal Corporations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sec-working-out-norms-for-safe-polling/article32908954.ece

The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has directed the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) to put a stop to the practice of its employees forcing the ill, the elderly, and women to get off the buses in the middle of the road at night.

Commission member V.K. Beenakumari directed the KSRTC to take strict action against such employees and inform the commission of it. The action comes on a complaint by Kadappakada resident K.R. Radhakrishnan.

A cardiac patient, he had boarded a KSRTC bus at Adoor and sought to disembark at Kollam cotton mill bus stop, but was forced to get off at Randakutti stop, the complainant said.

Report sought

The commission sought a report from the KSRTC managing director who in turn informed the panel that disciplinary action was taken against the conductor and driver of the bus that starts from the Adoor depot.

However, the commission demanded that the KSRTC’s usual practice of issuing a show-cause notice and seeking an explanation should not be repeated, nor should people be forced to disembark in the middle of the road at night in violation of existing directions on the matter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/shrc-asks-ksrtc-to-care-for-the-ill-elderly-women/article32905865.ece

160,2020/10/21,Isaac opens tree banking project in Wayanad,"Govt. will set up coffee processing factory in district, says Finance Minister

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has said that the government was in its final step to set up a coffee processing factory in Wayanad district to market coffee powder under the “Wayanadan Coffee” brand.

Speaking after inaugurating the tree banking project of the Meenangadi grama panchayat through video conferencing here on Tuesday, Mr. Isaac said that the project envisaged ensuring sustainable income to coffee farmers in the district, a major Robusta coffee growing region in the country.

The tree banking project has been launched as part of developing the panchayat as the first “carbon-neutral panchayat” in the country. The carbon neutral project of the civic body would help to market the “Wayanadan coffee” powder even in foreign markets, Mr. Isaac said.

Hence, all grama panchayats should adopt steps to expand the project in the district, he said.

According to the scheme, for each newly planted sapling of the tree species enlisted by the panchayat, a farmer will get ₹50 every year from the second year onwards after the sapling takes root as interest-free loan. The Meenangadi Service Cooperative Bank would provide the loans, Dr. Isaac said.

The government had deposited ₹10 crore in the Meenangadi Cooperative Bank to run the scheme. As each tree under the project would be geo-tagged, the panchayat authorities could easily identify the growth or destruction each plant. The project would take an active role in the social and economic development of the in the district, the Minister said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/isaac-opens-tree-banking-project-in-wayanad/article32904529.ece

163,2020/10/21,Paivalike solar project to be ready for commissioning next month,"The 50 MW project is part of the Solar Park in Kasaragod district

The 50 MW solar project at Paivalike, part of the Solar Park in Kasaragod district, is expected to be ready for commissioning next month.

The work on the project had entered the final stages, said officials of Renewable Power Corporation of Kerala Limited (RPCKL), a joint venture of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) and central PSU Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI).

With the commissioning of the Paivalike component, the total capacity of the Solar Park would go up to 100 MW, said RPCKL chief executive officer Augustine Thomas. Initially, a 50 MW project had been commissioned at Ambalathara in the district on September 14, 2017.

The upcoming 50 MW component is spread over 250 acres in Paivalike village in Manjeswaram. The tariff has been fixed at ₹3.10 per unit. The power would be evacuated to the KSEB grid via the 110 kV substation at Kubanoor, situated 8.5 km from the Paivalike, officials said. “Construction of a 33 kV transmission line for evacuating power from Paivalike to Kubanoor is in progress,” said Mr. Thomas.

The KSEB had signed a tripartite agreement with SECI and the THDC India Limited (THDCIL) on March 31, 2015, for developing the 50 MW solar photovoltaic project at Paivalike as part of the Solar Park envisaged in Kasaragod. The RPCKL and THDCIL had inked the land-use agreement on February 7, 2019.

In August, the work was awarded to Tata Power Solar Systems Limited. The work was originally scheduled to be completed by August, but the COVID-19 pandemic had caused delays.

The total capacity of the Solar Park is expected to go up to 105 MW in the near future. Another 5 MW project was envisioned at Ambalathara, said RPCKL officials.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/paivalike-solar-project-to-be-ready-for-commissioning-next-month/article32904186.ece
164,2020/10/21,Resilience is the key,"How an MBA degree helps an organisation grow even in difficult times

We live in an era in which one has to adapt to the new normal, appreciate the changed environs and chart a path accordingly. In these turbulent times, certain organisations have shown resilience and grit in managing this transition. Why is resilience such an important factor in these tough times?

Resilience helps companies take precautionary measures to ensure continuity and sustainability. The business environment is dynamic and professionals need to develop agility of thought and action to survive. Higher education, especially management education, has to groom leaders who are resilient, sensitive and able to evolve and adapt to adverse situations.

Managers play an important role in building resilient organisations. The current pandemic makes resilience an important aspect for young managers. Here is how an MBA programme educates and trains future managers to build a resilient organisation:

Leadership strategy: The ability to anticipate the future based on current trends and staying flexible to adapt is a critical skill. Learning not just from our own experiences but also those of others and then translating that into substantive action will enable individuals and the organisation to gain a competitive edge. Strategising, combined with disciplined execution, is the key to sustainability and resilience. A good management programme, therefore, will encourage students to foresee and strategise by solving real-time business problems as case studies, live projects and simulations.

Innovation and adaptation: Generating alternative paths with optimised results, innovating, implementing new will help organisations ensure business continuity. Encouraging an entrepreneurial culture within the organisation will help accelerate innovation. An MBA curriculum is designed to enable students to innovate and manage ambiguity, understand common issues and gain a better understanding of a thriving organisation.

Creative problem-solving: An MBA course helps budding managers to think out-of-the-box and appreciate multiple points of view and adopt a considered approach.. Professionals can foresee and adopt practices that will help deliver better results and not persist with an ineffective course. This will help an organisation analyse patterns and create contingency plans for crisis management.

Real-world knowledge: An MBA acts as a bridge to the real business world. Field trips, internships, live projects, simulations and case studies enable students to understand the application of conceptual knowledge in a real-world scenario. This allows students to discern a novel and complete perspective, deal with disruptive changes in the real world and design and deploy plans that can ensure continued business success.

Empathising and building a community: Building organisational resilience requires employees to display their innate resilience. Empathising with each other and enabling their team to adapt and grow will help the organisation grow even during tough times. While coursework, marks and the degree form a major part of the MBA degree, the relationships built and experiences gained outside class are what makes the learning complete and build a network that provides a bulwark in tough times.

Organisational resilience cannot be built overnight. It needs leaders who understand, care and grow together. The right kind of management education will definitely provide the necessary skills and knowledge for students to go out into the corporate world and create organisations that will grow and sustain.

165,2020/10/21,‘Avengers’ actors assemble to defend Chris Pratt on Twitter,"The actor has been dubbed “the worst Chris” after an online poll, and was trolled for his involvement in a conservative church

Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) stars Robert Downey Jr, Mark Ruffalo and Zoe Saldana have rallied in support of co-star Chris Pratt who was dubbed “the worst Chris” on Twitter.

A user started a poll on microblogging site, asking people to choose the “worst Chris” from all the Chrises of Hollywood: Chris Pine, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt.

Those who took part in the poll started trolling Pratt for his involvement in a conservative church, which was described as “infamously anti-LGBTQ” by actor Ellen Page a few years ago.

They also claimed that Pratt is a secret supporter of US President Donald Trump.

Defending his “Avengers: Infinity War” and “Avengers: Endgame” co-star, Downey Jr asked Pratt’s detractors to look at their own lives before commenting on him.

“What a world... The ‘sinless’ are casting stones at my #brother, Chris Pratt... A real #Christian who lives by #principle, has never demonstrated anything but #positivity and #gratitude...” Downey Jr wrote in a post on Instagram alongside a photo of his with Pratt.

The MCU veteran also highlighted Pratt’s marriage to author Katherine Schwarzenegger, saying that her family “makes space for civil discourse” and “insists on service as the highest value”.

“If you take issue with Chris... I’ve got a novel idea. Delete your social media accounts, sit with your OWN defects of #character, work on THEM, then celebrate your humanness... @prattprattpratt I #gotyerbackbackback” Downey Jr added.

Ruffalo took to Twitter and urged Pratt’s critics to leave him alone and refocus on the presidential election due to take place on November 3.

“You all, @prattprattpratt is as solid a man there is. I know him personally, and instead of casting aspersions, look at how he lives his life. He is just not overtly political as a rule.

“This is a distraction. Let’s keep our eyes on the prize, friends. We are so close now,” he wrote.

Saldana, who plays Gamora opposite Pratt’s Peter Quill aka Star Lord in the MCU, also tweeted in defence of the actor.

“No matter how hard it gets, stick your chest out, keep your head up and handle it --Tupac. You got this @prattprattpratt . Your family, friends, colleagues & everyone who’s ever crossed paths with you knows your heart and your worth!” she tweeted.

Filmmaker James Gunn, who directed Pratt’s two “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies, addressed the criticism that the actor’s church is “homophobic.”

“So do 98% of Christians, all Catholics, most Muslims & some Jews. I was a Catholic for years, hoping I could have a bigger impact working for gay rights from the inside. I eventually gave up. But it was a valid choice & I applaud other non-bigots who do the same,” he tweeted.

He further stated that Pratt had previously clarified that his church’s views do not reflect his own personal opinions and he believes “that everyone is entitled to love who they want“.

Pratt’s wife Katherine Schwarzenegger, meanwhile, slammed an online outlet for giving air to a mean-spirited social media story.

“Is this really what we need? There’s so much going on in the world and people struggling in so many ways. Being mean is so yesterday. There’s enough room to love all these guys. Love is what we all need not meanness and bullying. Let’s try that,” she wrote in the comments section of the outlet’s Instagram page.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/lbnws9/article32909133.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/601961230,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/avengers-actors-assemble-to-defend-chris-pratt-on-twitter/article32909134.ece
166,2020/10/21,Sanjay Dutt on cancer: Happy to come out victorious from this battle,"In August, Sanjay Dutt had announced that he would be taking a break from his professional commitments to focus on medical treatment

Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt on October 21 announced that he has come out “victorious” from his cancer battle and thanked fans and well-wishers for their unwavering support in this journey.

The 61-year-old actor shared the news in a statement on Twitter on the occasion of his children’s birthday, Shaahran and Iqra who turned 10 on October 21.

“The last few weeks were very difficult time for my family and me. But like they say, God gives the hardest battles to his strongest soldiers. And today, on the occasion of my kids’ birthday, I am happy to come out victorious from this battle and be able to give them the best gift I can. The health and wellbeing of our family,” Sanjay Dutt said.

The news comes days after a family source told PTI that the actor had responded “very well” to the medical treatment for cancer.

In August, Sanjay Dutt had announced that he would be taking a break from his professional commitments to focus on medical treatment, amid speculation that he was battling lung cancer.

The actor, in his statement, further thanked friends and family for being his source of strength.

“This wouldn’t have been possible without the unwavering faith and support from all of you. I am eternally grateful to my family, friends and all the fans who have stood by me and been my source of strength through this trying time. Thank you for the love, kindness and the countless blessings that you have sent my way,” he said.

Sanjay Dutt, who was undergoing treatment at a hospital here, also extended his gratitude to the team of doctors and medical staff.

“I am especially grateful to Dr Sewanti and her team of doctors, nurses and the medical staff at Kokilaben Hospital who have taken such good care of me in the last few weeks. Humbled and grateful,” he added.

The actor, who was last seen in “Sadak 2”, opened up about his cancer diagnosis for the first time last week in an Instagram video shared by celebrity hairstylist Aalim Hakim.

He is gearing up for the shooting of his next, “KGF: Chapter2”, in November.

167,2020/10/21,"Mira Nair on ‘A Suitable Boy’: ‘Our past was real, truthful and prickly’","The director talks about adapting Vikram Seth’s novel, and describes the making of the show as a monumental and joyful task

The world of Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy is a familiar one for Mira Nair. The auteur’s latest project has been the breathtakingly beautiful BBC show based on the 1349-page tome. “It was 1951,” Mira says over a video call from the US. The filmmaker, who turned 63 on October 15, continues, “It was the year my parents got married. My father was a civil servant, he moved from Punjab to Orissa. I have lived in that time in a very real way. It is an era I have known, smelt, enjoyed and loved.”

From Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love (1996) and Vanity Fair (2004) to Amelia (2009), Mira has worked on period dramas. “I do not set out to make a period drama. For me it is quite the reverse. It is how to make a period drama, not feel period at all. How to make it breathe with life and with the unpredictability of life and yet be true in every single detail, to the time it was. Making A Suitable Boy was about how to sift through the modern mayhem of current Indian life, away from the frame.”

Director Mira Nair

Mira laughs heartily remembering people who wanted to be in the film, sneaking into the frame. “We dressed 200 extras for the scene. I would say ‘action’ and the extras would come out of the train in their handloom and thelas and there would be two people in sneakers, skinny jeans and backpacks in the throng. I would leap out of the chair demanding ‘Aap kaun ho? Aapko kaun bulaya? Hamare kapde kahan hai?’ (Who are you? Who called you? Where are our clothes?)”

Making A Suitable Boy was a huge, monumental and joyful task, says Mira. “I always saw it as cinema, so the horizons were vast and there was great depth of field. In the scenes with the Ganga, with the boats and the Ghats, we are seeing three or four levels into the horizon.”

Admitting to having an acute ear, Mira says, “We spoke like how they do in A Suitable Boy. It was a polished, convent school English. It is very different from the English we speak now. You have these Mumbai people saying ‘What are you doing yaar? What’s up? blah blah blah…’ (mimes a hulking Neanderthal). It is actually how we used to speak English in the 50s, 60s and 70s. Once television came in to India, we began to sound very American. All that had to be changed; so there was a fair amount of work on verbal dialogue.”

Thanks to the pandemic, there was no dubbing. “That was the other extraordinary part of making A Suitable Boy. We did six months of post-production remotely on computers. We sent the cast microphones and they dubbed the entire of six hours. It was extraordinary. Tanya (Maniktala), Ishaan (Khatter), Tabu everyone, whether you are a big star or not everyone did pura jugaad.”

Tanya plays Lata, whose mother wants to find her a suitable boy and Ishaan who plays Maan, who is in love with the completely unsuitable Saeeda (Tabu) are practically new comers. “I am unafraid of casting first-timers. I have to see the spirit of the character in the person, that they have what instinctively feels to me like the essence of the character,” Mira says.

“For instance, I could see the mercurial and charming Maan in Ishaan. It was not fake, it was coming from within. It was the same with casting Tanya. A Suitable Boy rests on her shoulders. I call Lata a dewdrop in action. She is on the brink of life, she hasn't seen everything yet. But she is also intelligent and very self-possessed. She is unlike most young girls today, who have been there and done that. Lata has a certain innocence, of observing without fully knowing what life has to offer.”

Mira is grateful to her casting directors, Dilip Shankar, Nandini Shrikent and Karan Mally. “They cast all my films. This was a one-year casting process. This is the first international show that is entirely cast and made in India because I insisted on it.”

The script, however, was written Britisher Andrew Davies. Wouldn’t a south Asian script writer have been a more apt choice? “To be honest, yes, but I came to the party a little later when Andrew had already been picked and eight hours of script written. I loved his distillation. Andrew gave it the television pace that we needed. He was extremely porous and welcoming to my suggestions. I wanted to shift the emphasis to being a marriage of the politics of the time and the personal journey of Lata and Maan and not have just a Pride and Prejudice kind of vibe of who will she marry. Lata and Maan were the embodiment of modern India—of that India of 1951.”

Does that mean upper caste, middle class, educated families were representative of the larger Indian experience of the time? “Oh, no,” Mira clarifies. “India is based in the hinterland. But Vikram Seth’s story is resolutely set in the anglicised, privileged class. Even though several classes are depicted, the major characters are ‘English-soaked.’ I wanted to bring out the truth of these characters. The characters are who they are as Vikram wrote them.”

While Mira has joked about A Suitable Boy being The Crown in brown, one wonders what part nostalgia plays in the appeal of the show. “It was important for me to hold a mirror to what India used to be at that time—politically and emotionally. Despite the wounds of Partition, there was still a deeply syncretic and interwoven culture between Hindu and Muslim, from the poetry and music, to the friendships and the great loves. That absolutely inextricable tapestry is being threatened today. The young of today will not have any idea of how it could have been. My mother used to say ‘savere hum Id manate the or shaam mein Diwali…’ (we would celebrate Id in the morning and Diwali in the evening). That is not going to be remembered if we are not careful. Our past in A Suitable Boy was real, truthful and prickly. It was not smooth sailing because the seeds of what we are doing now were planted at that time. It was not nostalgia for its own sake, but about holding a mirror so that the young of today can remember a time from whence we came.”

A Suitable Boy will stream on Netflix from October 23",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/wlshp4/article32908969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/final2079651220796502-Edit,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mira-nair-on-a-suitable-boy-our-past-was-real-truthful-and-prickly/article32908972.ece
168,2020/10/21,Four conservative values forms the backdrop of Akshara Haasan’s next film,"Akshara Haasan and filmmaker Raja Ramamurthy discuss their upcoming film ‘Achcham Madam Naanam Payirppu’

It is hard to categorise or guess what Achcham Madam Naanam Payirppu (AMNP) is about. If you have watched the film’s trailer, it is clear that debutant director Raja Ramamurthy does not want you to get even a hint of the plot.

Starring Akshara Haasan, Usha Uthup and Malgudi Shubha among others, AMNP follows the story of a 19-year-old girl, Pavithra (played by Akshara), who hails from a conservative family. In a Zoom chat, Akshara and Raja discuss the upcoming film, scheduled to be released on a digital streaming platform soon. Excerpts:

Can you tell us what AMNP is about?

Raja: Growing up in our society, girls are brought up by parents with these four values: achcham (fear), madam (innocence), naanam (shy), payirppu (chaste). This is what she is told she requires to be a ‘good woman’. These value systems become the central argument in my storyline.

The cast seems unconventional. What made you choose these actors?

Raja: I wanted to cast against type. Like Akshara, whose character is completely the opposite to what she is in real life. With Usha ma’am, she plays a veteran Carnatic singer, but she is a rockstar in real life. Malgudi Shubha ma’am plays a character with evil shades but she is one of the sweetest human beings you will come across.

Was it tough playing Pavithra?

Akshara: It is a very contrasting role but Raja had written it so well, and he was clear about what was required of me. Life becomes easier for an actor when that is the case.

How was it working with veterans like Usha Uthup and Malgudi Shubha?

Raja: It is extremely easy working with them because they are curious to learn new stuff. It was Shubha ma’am who kept the set alive.

Akshara: Shubha ma’am is positively contagious. Having such a person around would lighten up everyone’s moods. Usha ma’am is large-hearted and an extremely generous personality. She sang a song for all of us on the last day of shoot.

You are releasing the film on OTT platform. What are your two cents on the OTT vs theatre debate?

Raja: Until we find a vaccine, people will be comfortable watching films from the comfort of their homes. Theatres and OTT will have to co-exist. If a movie like Tenet didn’t do well because people did not want to take a chance with their lives, it speaks volumes. But this is also the time to start making movies for the big screen. I am not talking about the mass films we do with huge market heroes, but films that warrant a big screen watch.

Akshara: We have no choice due to COVID-19 but not everyone watches a lot of content online or subscribe to OTT platforms. However, it has definitely grown, and it is exposing people to newer filmmaking styles because of the wide range of content that is available.

What are your upcoming projects?

Akshara: There are a couple of stories under discussion but nothing much I can reveal now. I spent most of lockdown reading, writing and watching a lot of films on OTT platforms. I also kept myself active because it is easy to feel like kids when we have no work, and just sit at home and eat pizza. But as we grow older, we need to be more active. I have also recently started making preserves and jams, and that is keeping me busy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ezcxh8/article32908847.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPAMNP-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/four-conservative-values-forms-the-backdrop-of-akshara-haasans-next-film/article32908848.ece
169,2020/10/21,‘Ours is a democracy that doesn’t understand freedom of speech and expression’: Saqib Saleem,"Actor Saqib Saleem discusses playing a stand-up comedian in his recent film ‘Comedy Couple’

In no dystopian world can Saqib Saleem fall short of people fawning over his looks. Yet the model-turned-actor, who is actor Huma Qureshi’s sibling, takes a compliment on his appearance lightly.

“I’m flattered that you think I look good,” he says, over phone from Mumbai. The comment crops up because of his upcoming film, Comedy Couple, in which Saqib plays one half of a stand-up comedy act alongside co-star Shweta Basu Prasad: the reason being the commonly-held belief that a comic role isn’t the strongest suit for good-looking male actors.

Saqib disagrees. “Akshay Kumar, in his 50s, is one of the hottest men around, and the best in comedy. So, I don’t think it is true but yes, as a genre, comedy is entirely different from action films. Timing is crucial in comedy,” he says, and uses a soccer metaphor to elaborate: “Action scenes are like set-pieces, whereas in comedy, you need to add to what you have been provided with and create something else.” He adds: “I consider myself closer to the guy I play in Comedy Couple.”

Saqib plays Deep Sharma, who alongside Shweta’s Zoya Batra, does a dual standup act. Directed by Nachiket Samant, the film is produced by Yoodlee Films, the movie production arm of Saregama India. The film was shot post relaxation of lockdown restrictions in Mumbai and in the comedy clubs of Gurugram.

To get their timing right, the actors and the director held a workshop for 10 days. “It was important to get the stand-up act in the film right... because I say half the joke and she (Shweta) completes it,” he says.

Saqib then went to work on his standup set. “I watched a lot of stand-up comedy while prepping, and I realised that the most important thing a comic needs is the storytelling ability. He is able to create the environment where people start laughing because, at some level, they share their personal stories. So we used the workshop to craft the standup material for our film by using personal stories and anecdotes,” he adds.

However, shooting a stand-up set within a film during the pandemic came with its challenges. “The restrictions meant we couldn’t shoot with an audience. So we shot them separately. The difficult part was to understand where the director wanted his edits — the portions where he wanted laughter or just a chuckle, and then to preempt those emotions in my head before performing,” he remarks.

Saqib calls Comedy Couple’s screenplay “progressive” and it is one reason why the jokes in the film also take on the intolerance in society. “Even if you are offended by something,” says Saqib, “the way you express your opinion is important. It should not be by way of threat. We may be a democracy but I feel we don’t understand what freedom of speech and expression means.”

After Comedy Couple, the actor awaits the release of the big budget multi-starrer film directed by Kabir Khan, 83 — the film chronicling the success of the 1983 Cricket World Cup winning men’s cricket team.

Saqib plays Mohinder Amarnath in a cast that is headlined by Ranveer Singh, who plays Kapil Dev. “I think 83 is eyeing a Christmas 2020 release. Now that cinema halls are open in some places with reduced occupancy, let us wait and watch if 83 can bring people back to theatres,” he adds.

Titled Aranya in Telugu, Kaadan in Tamil and Haathi Mere Saathi in Hindi, director Prabhu Solomon’s film was initially scheduled to release on April 2, 2020, but was forced to change plans due to the pandemic. The pan-Indian film starring Rana Daggubati, Vishnu Vishal, Shriya Pilgaonkar and Zoya Hussain is now scheduled to release in theatres in January 2021 to coincide with the Sankranthi festival season.

The makers of Aranya announced the theatrical release with a new poster and video, highlighting the importance of saving the jungles: ‘As we fight together against the deadly pandemic, we must look to our forests for inspiration — the lungs of our planet that have long battled a growing pandemic of deforestation and industrialisation.”

Aranya is a fictional story based on true incidents. Rana plays Bandev, the jungle man, who stands up against urbanisation encroaching into jungle corridors. His character is inspired by environment activist Jadav Payeng. The Padma Shri winner who hails from the ‘Mising’ tribe in Assam, converted more than 1300 acres of barren land into a reserve forest. The film narrates the story of a man living in the jungle for 25 years and talks about ecological issues.

172,2020/10/21,"Son Heung-min interview: On Kane, Mourinho, and ‘All or Nothing’","The South Korean international and Tottenham Hotspur superstar talks about starring in Amazon Prime’s hit documentary and all things football

He’s the most popular Asian footballer in the world, captain of the South Korean national team, and widely regarded as one of the nicest guys to ever play the beautiful game.

But Son Heung-min is most recognised for his fantastic rise at Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, where he’s spent over five years, and grown into one of the most exciting attacking players in Europe.

Already leading the charts in the 2020-21 season with seven goals, Son has taken to football in the ‘new normal’ belligerently well, terrorising opposition defences with his pace, dribbling and immaculate shooting abilities, as his relationship with England captain Harry Kane reaches elite levels under the watchful eye of legendary manager Jose Mourinho.

However, the focus of our interview is on the footballer’s previous season — which has now been immortalised — in the hit Amazon Prime documentary All or Nothing. The series, which premiered globally in August, gave audiences a ringside view into the workings of a modern-day behemoth of a football club, while also tracing connections between players, the coaching staff, dealing with success, failure, banter and everything else in between.

Unsurprisingly, Son’s popularity has skyrocketed even more after the airing of the documentary, as fans have endeared to the 28-year-old’s calm demeanor and explosive playing style.

On a Zoom call recently from London, the Asian sports icon chats with us about his experience shooting for the series, what it means for the club’s fan base, his relationships with his peers, and more…

Excerpts from an interview:

Did the cameras make you guys conscious and change your behaviour in any way during the shooting of the documentary?

Not at all. You honestly forget the cameras being around, especially in the heat of the moment, or times like when we eat and joke around at the restaurants. There were even arguments, such as the one I had with Hugo (Lloris), that all happen during the game and we sort it out later.

Your manager Jose Mourinho said it was really weird seeing what goes on inside the hallowed walls of the dressing room, telecast on-screen...

I gotta be honest; I totally agree with the gaffer! (laughs) It was really weird for us, hearing my voice, and watching how we trained and played. But from the perspective of an audience, it must have been fun. It’s good for Amazon that something entertaining was happening in every episode, but for us, watching unlucky things like injuries come out of nowhere and change the complexion of the season was sad to witness.

The relationship you have with such a divisive figure like Mourinho is also something we get to see a bit of — any comments on that?

I remember I was on international break when I got the news that Poch (Spurs’ former manager Mauricio Pochettino) had been sacked. I had a really great bond with him, and was sad to see him go.

But then, we learnt that one of the best managers in the world was coming to take over; I’ve grown up watching Jose winning so many trophies and now I was walking next to him! It’s been fantastic. We have started really well this season, and his winning mentality can bring us success. I do think people misunderstand him sometimes. It’s been a year since he came in, and I’ve really enjoyed working with him.

Do you think the documentary has increased the fan base for Spurs as a football club globally?

Like I said, we didn’t really feel comfortable with the cameras being everywhere. But on the positive side, the series has helped Tottenham become bigger and is a good sign of things to come. Viewers can see how our club operates, how much effort we put into training and preparing for games, and so on. Sometimes we don’t perform phenomenally, but we always give it our all.

We players don’t like talking about the show too much though. I only see Moussa (Sissoko) watching it all the time, especially when we are flying to our European games. But he watches only the clips he’s part of. (laughs)

There’s also plenty of footage of you playing with the youth prospects at the club, did you enjoy that?

Absolutely. You know, when I was 17 and playing for Hamburg in Germany as a teen, it was thrilling to get an opportunity to meet the first team players. I just want to share my experience and help them do well in their careers as much as possible.

All or Nothing also places a lot of emphasis on the bond between you and Harry Kane. You both have started this season together like a house on fire..

Harry and I have been playing together for over five years now, and we understand each other really well. We even go to the airport and training ground together sometimes, and the friendship off the field has only made our relationship on the pitch stronger.

We talk about every single situation during training and tactical sessions, and his ability to understand me and my game, translates onto the field brilliantly.

Would you consent to be part of another documentary in the future?

A documentary on me or the football club? I don’t know… unfortunately you can’t predict which season you’re going to be successful in before filming it. (laughs). But I’m still young, so you never know. Maybe yes or maybe not? We’ll see.

177,2020/10/21,Mi phone consignment worth ₹15 crore looted off the Highway,"The consignment that included 15 cartons of 960 mobile phones each and a few more mobile phones were shifted to another vehicle.

A container carrying mobile phones was looted of its consignment and the drivers attacked, in Melumalai, Shoolagiri, in the early hours of Wednesday.

The Mi mobile phones suspected to have been worth ₹15 crore was looted by a gang suspected to have carried out similar such attacks in many districts in Andhra Pradesh.

The consignment that originated from Sriperampudur Industrial Estate was crossing Shoolagiri in Hosur, when the truck was reportedly stopped on the Highway at about 2 a.m. The drivers Arun (26) and Kumar (29) were attacked by a gang that tied them up. The consignment that included 15 cartons of 960 mobile phones each and a few more mobile phones were shifted to another vehicle. The gang had fled the spot with the consignment. The drivers Arun and Kumar later found help from the Highway patrol, who alerted the district police.

A total of 14,500 mobile phones worth around ₹15 crore is suspected to have been looted, though the police were still awaiting a formal complaint from the company as of Wednesday evening. The container vehicle that belonged to DHL courier was retrieved from the spot.

Speaking to The Hindu, Superintendent of Police Bandi Gangadhar said, the truck was stopped by the gang that is believed to have followed the consignment from the point of origin. “The same modus operandi was followed in Nellore, Chittor, Guntur, Warangal districts of Andhra Pradesh, where a gang would follow the vehicle and intercept it in a desolate spot. We are yet to receive a complaint from the company and we have the accounts of the drivers. The courier company’s vehicle is however intact,” Mr. Gangadhar said.

Earlier, Mr.Gangadhar visited the spot. The DIG Pradip Kumar reviewed the site as well. Truck jacking incidents have occurred in the same stretch of the Highway in Melumalai in Shoolagiri earlier. In 2015, a consignment carrying aluminum worth several crore was stolen and the driver was brutally murdered sparking an inter-State strike by truckers demanding protection.

Following the incident, truckers were issued an advisory to not to park in desolate places and only in designated lay-by along the Highway.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/y4w3qi/article32908931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21IN-MIPHONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mi-phone-consignment-worth-15-crore-looted-off-the-highway/article32908932.ece

185,2020/10/21,Kallakurichi police introduce dedicated beat system in 562 villages,"Over 500 policemen have been exclusively drafted for this community outreach initiative

As part of their community outreach initiative, Kallakurichi district police have introduced a dedicated beat system in over 500 villages across the district to ensure visible policing and improve police-public interface.

Over 500 policemen have been exclusively drafted for this initiative that has been executed in all the 562 mother villages and hamlets coming under three police-sub divisions in the district.

According to Superintendent of Police, Ziaul Haque, the interface will be used for sharing information, public grievances and serious issues. The police personnel were given a briefing about the initiative and the tasks were assigned to them, he said.

Cops in the rank of Grade I constables to Special Sub-Inspectors of Police will visit the designated villages twice a week and build contacts by interacting with the village heads, village administrative officers and other prominent persons to assess non-policing issues and undercurrent tension, which if left unattended could trigger a potential law and order problem”, he said.

The personnel will record any untoward incident and forward it to the officers concerned for immediate action.

The beat staff will also share their mobile numbers in the respective villages and will gather information on social issues, revenue problems and previous law and order issues.

A detailed profile of the villages would be maintained by every Beat staff. The cops would also bring major issues that could later snowball into law and order problems to the immediate notice of the Inspectors of Police under whose jurisdiction the station is located.

“This will be part of the policing system and not only helps the Department in addressing issues immediately but will also help nipping any potential problems in the bud. This system has now helped us in improving policing and defuse tension. We could prevent a caste flare up at Thirunavalur at midnight recently”, Mr. Haque added.

The Inspectors of Police in the respective police stations will compile the reports containing the information shared by personnel at the end of every week and forward potential problematic issues to the attention of the Deputy Superintendents of Police.

The DSPs will analyse all the reports and forward major issues that could be brought to the notice of the SP and the District Collector.

Grievances relating to revenue department and civic issues including road facilities will also be brought to the notice of the administration.

This initiative has not only helped in bringing down crimes per se but has also improved public satisfaction of the Department and helped us, Mr. Haque added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sj841v/article32906477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ziaul2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/kallakurichi-police-introduce-dedicated-beat-system-in-562-villages/article32906463.ece
186,2020/10/21,Moderate rain likely in parts of Tamil Nadu today,"Low pressure area has formed over Bay

A fresh low pressure that has formed over central parts of the Bay of Bengal will trigger rainfall over many parts of the State till Wednesday. However, the intensity of rain may reduce from Thursday as the weather system is expected to move northwards, according to the Meteorological Department.

On Tuesday, rain lashed many parts of Chennai. Some weather stations in Nungambakkam, Puzhal and Meenambakkam received up to 1 cm till noon. A few areas in north Chennai were waterlogged due to early morning showers.

During the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday, Salem received the highest amount of rainfall of 9 cm.

Officials of the Meteorological Department said the low pressure area and a cyclonic circulation associated with it were likely to bring light to moderate rainfall over most parts of the State. However, such widespread rainfall would last only till Wednesday as the system is expected to move away.

One or two places in nearly 13 districts, including Salem, Dharmapuri, Vellore and Perambalur may get heavy rainfall on Wednesday. Some north coastal areas may have rain up to moderate intensity till Thursday.

Thunderstorms may occur in some areas of Chennai till Thursday and the city may enjoy a generally cloudy sky and a day temperature of 30 degree Celsius.

Chennai has so far recorded 9.4 cm of rainfall in Nungambakkam and 4 cm in Meenambakkam this month. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said rainfall activity may be restricted to a few areas over the State from Thursday as the weather system is not expected to intensify.

“We are expecting the northeast monsoon to set in during the last week of October,” he added.

The Meteorological Department has also warned fishermen against venturing into the central Bay of Bengal as squally wind with a speed of up to 60 km per hour may blow till October 23.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/w9y9do/article32904772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21RAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/moderate-rain-likely-in-parts-of-state-today/article32904773.ece
187,2020/10/21,"13,415 seats filled in 2nd round of counselling","Over 9,400 candidates stayed away

Results of the second round of counselling for single-window engineering admissions were released on Tuesday. A total of 13,415 candidates opted for seats in various colleges.

The Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) committee had invited 22,903 candidates, whose cut-offs ranged between 174.75 and 145.5. However, as many as 9,488 candidates stayed away.

While seats in Anna University’s four departments filled up, Annamalai University, which since last year has been under the TNEA for counselling, was struggling to fill seats.

Annamalai University offers three different programmes in Computer Science and Engineering, including Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Although CSE remained a favourite among students with good cut-off marks, the new courses or even the traditional CSE had not found takers.

Anna University’s constituent college in Kancheepuram did better than its counterparts in Arni, Tindivanam and Cuddalore.

At the University College in Tiruchi, almost all seats in biotechnology were allotted. There are only two vacancies in the SC category and one in the SCA category.

All but one filled

Chennai-based colleges such as Jeppiar and St. Joseph’s filled all but one seat in biotechnology.

In the PSG College of Technology, there are no seats in bio-medical engineering or biotechnology.

Despite the rush to start courses such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Machine Learning, there was no rush from students for the courses, said teachers. “The students preferred traditional courses. It is difficult to predict what the students will choose,” a professor said.

The decision to launch these courses was made following encouragement from the All India Council for Technical Education, the teachers said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/13415-seats-filled-in-2nd-round-of-counselling/article32904722.ece
188,2020/10/21,Vaiko urges Governor to approve 7.5% reservation,"MDMK general secretary Vaiko on Tuesday urged Governor Banwarilal Purohit to give assent to the legislation seeking to provide 7.5% reservation in medical colleges for NEET-qualified students from government schools.

In a letter to the Governor, a copy of which was released to the media, he said 41% of Class 12 students in Tamil Nadu studied in government schools, but only 0.15% of them were able to enter medical colleges.

“Government school students come from socially and economically weaker sections of the society. It is against social justice to place them on a par with students studying in other educational institutions,” he said.

Pointing out that the legislation for providing 7.5% reservation to government school students was enacted in the Assembly based on the recommendations of Justice P. Kalaiarasan, Mr. Vaiko said if it was implemented, around 300 students from government schools would be able to enter medical colleges.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vaiko-urges-governor-to-approve-75-reservation/article32904708.ece
189,2020/10/21,Governor likely to clear quota in medical courses,"But he is said to have reservations on varsity bifurcation Bill

Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit is likely to clear a Bill envisaging 7.5% horizontal reservation in admissions to undergraduate medical courses for students from government schools in the State who qualify in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test. But he is said to be having reservations about another Bill, pertaining to the bifurcation of Anna University.

Revealing this, a source in the State government told The Hindu that the Governor was of the view that the bifurcation scheme, as mentioned in the Bill, may not be financially sustainable for the proposed Anna Technological and Research University (ATRU), which would have to depend purely on the government’s grants.

On Tuesday, a group of senior Ministers, including School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan, Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar, Law Minister C. Ve. Shanmugam, Higher Education Minister K.T. Anbalagan and Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar, met the Governor at the Raj Bhavan and they held discussions for more than an hour.

Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam and other senior officials were also present at the meeting.

The discussion was only on the 7.5% quota Bill, according to Mr. Jayakumar.

The Fisheries Minister said the Governor was “examining” the quota Bill from various angles, adding, “We are confident that he will come out with a favourable decision on the matter.”

He said the team of Ministers had impressed upon the Governor the need for him giving his assent early to the quota Bill. Apart from the State being a “land of social justice”, he said the horizontal quota would enable more government school students to pursue medical courses.

On the issue of Anna University’s bifurcation, the government source said Mr. Purohit apparently felt that if the government considers Anna University, under the present circumstances, to be ‘overloaded’, there could be two technical universities sharing the load equally, instead of the proposed arrangement of one university having the affiliated system and another being a unitary-type institution and bringing under its fold the College of Engineering, Guindy, Alagappa College of Technology, the School of Architecture and Planning and the Madras Institute of Technology.

Though the bifurcation was originally conceived in the light of the Central government’s decision last year to provide the status of Institution of Eminence (IoE) to Anna University, Mr. Anbalagan recently went on record, stating that the university did not require the status if it meant the ‘loss’ of 69% vertical reservation and “denied admission to poor students”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/yukaa7/article32904683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THPUROHIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/governor-likely-to-clear-quota-in-medical-courses/article32904684.ece
190,2020/10/21,Man booked for issuing rape threat to Vijay Sethupathi ’s daughter,"Vijay Sethupathi had faced criticism over his role in cricketer’s biopic

The cyber crime wing of the Chennai police booked a Twitter user for issuing a rape threat to actor Vijay Sethupathi’s daughter over Sri Lankan cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan’s biopic controversy.

The user, who goes by the Twitter handle @itsrithikrajh, on Monday issued a rape threat to the actor’s daughter, with a photograph of the father-daughter duo.

Several associations made online complaints and a few anonymous complaints were also received by the cyber crime wing.

“There has been lot of concern on social media regarding the comments made online against a celebrity. On receipt of complaints to this effect, a case has been registered in the cyber cell,” City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar tweeted, in response to the demands on social media. The police also said that Mr. Sethupathi’s representative had lodged a complaint at the Chennai Police Commissionerate, and it was following the complaint that the case was registered.

The man, identified as Rithik Raj, had been booked under various Sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot, enmity) and 294(b) (using obscene language) of the IPC and Section 67(b) of the IT Act (punishment for publishing material depicting children in sexually explicit act, in electronic form).

DMK MP Kanimozhi, DMDK founder Vijayakant, treasurer Premalatha Vijayakant and VCK chief Thol. Thirumavalavan condemned the rape threat made against Mr. Sethupathi’s daughter. Recently, similar threats were issued against Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s daughter after poor performance of the team in the Indian Premier League.

DMK MP Kanimozhi said on social media: “The perverse intimidation of Vijay Sethupathi’s #daughter is not only barbaric, but extremely dangerous to the very fabric of our society. Making women and children the soft targets is a cowardly act. The police should take stern action against the perpetrator.”

Mr. Vijayakant said he was shocked by the rape threats issued against the children of Mr. Sethupathi and Mr. Dhoni. “If someone disagrees with their activities, they can be criticised in a respectful manner. But nobody has the right to say nasty things about their family and children,” Mr. Vijayakant said. “Social media should be used to exchange ideas, not for these activities. Those who made these rape threats against the children of Vijay Sethupathi and Dhoni should be given strong punishment,” he said.

Ms. Premalatha also demanded that severe action be taken against those responsible for making the comments against Mr. Dhoni and Mr. Sethupathi.

Mr. Thirumavalavan said disagreements with Mr. Sethupathi should not be used to attack his daughter. “This is the height of indecency and perversion,” he said. I urge the State government to take action against the person who made the comments,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/4we3zb/article32904671.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THVIJAYSETHUPATHITIGERSADOPTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/man-booked-for-issuing-rape-threat-to-actors-daughter/article32904672.ece

He claimed that despite traders not coming forward to procure paddy in the wake of rain in the delta, the authorities were, even now, procuring paddy with higher level of moisture content and sending it for hulling.

The rates for the common variety and the grade ‘A’ variety were ₹1,918 per quintal and ₹1,958 per quintal respectively, Mr. Kamaraj added.

195,2020/10/21,AIADMK’s alliance is one of opportunism: Alagiri,"TNCC chief hits back at Minister Jayakumar over his comments

Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri on Tuesday said the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance was based on principles and not of “opportunistic politics” like the AIADMK-BJP front.

Responding to Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar’s claim that many parties [the DMK’s allies] were keen on joining the AIADMK front, and that the DMK was like an automobile that had suffered a breakdown, Mr. Alagiri said the Minister must stop engaging in “politics of comedy”, and the AIADMK had a lot of issues to resolve within its alliance.

‘Alliance strong’

Contrary to what the Minister claimed, the DMK alliance was quite strong, Mr. Alagiri said. “The DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance has been working in a united way and with discipline for the welfare of the people. The leader of the alliance, M.K. Stalin, is leading the front capably and always discusses issues with the alliance partners,” he added.

“Is the BJP a part of the AIADMK alliance or not? That itself is a big confusion [for them]. Only the BJP’s T.N. president, L. Murugan, greeted Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on being chosen as the CM candidate for the upcoming election. No other party in their alliance has done this. Have they deliberated on this issue?” he asked.

He wondered whether the BJP had been kept in the loop about the AIADMK choosing Mr. Palaniswami as the CM candidate. He said there could be no bigger insult for the BJP than being in the AIADMK alliance without even the slightest amount of respect.

“Can Mr. Jayakumar disclose which parties are there in the AIADMK alliance? The AIADMK is worried that if it includes the BJP in its alliance, it will face a humiliating defeat in the Assembly polls, similar to the one it suffered in the Lok Sabha election,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmks-alliance-is-one-of-opportunism-alagiri/article32904573.ece

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder Thol. Thirumavalavan said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation on Tuesday evening was a “disappointment”.

In a statement, he said there was an expectation that Mr. Modi would announce relief packages to the people who have suffered severe economic losses in the last few months due to the lockdown.

“He simply advised people. This is a disappointment. Due to the pandemic, the Indian economy has been the worst hit among all other major economies. Rural poverty has gone up and unemployment has increased throughout India and prices of essential commodities, such as onions, have increased,” said Mr. Thirumavalavan.

Under such circumstances, the Prime Minister was expected to make an announcement about relief. “However, he simply said wear masks. People need relief measures, not advice. Has the PM not understood this? Does he not care about the people? These are the questions that rise,” he said.

Mr. Thirumavalavan charged that the BJP had used the pandemic to increase petrol and diesel prices, get rid of subsidies for gas and remove workers’ legal rights.

The administration is evolving a plan to decongest the Sunday market ahead of the Deepavali season to prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 at a time when new cases and deaths have been on a downward trend.

According to Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi, a meeting with all stakeholders — Local Administration Department, law enforcement and traders — was proposed to chalk out a plan that would not inconvenience shoppers or ruin trade but at the same time offset a COVID-19 super-spreader eventuality.

Relief and Rehabilitation secretary A. Anbarasu said the thronging of the narrow space by large crowds was untenable during a pandemic.

“We cannot stop people from coming out for shopping during Diwali and neither we can’t allow breach of safety protocols. So, we have to find an alternative to decongest the place,” Mr. Anbarasu said.

The multiple entries and exits pose a challenge from the perspective of crowd control, it was pointed out at the meeting.

The authorities are looking to come up with a clear action plan in the next couple of days. Similarly, plan for regulation of crowd is also being evolved for places that attract high footfall such as places of worship, shopping malls and markets.

According to the Lt. Governor, a team of ICMR experts was expected to visit Puducherry next week for an assessment of the COVID-19 situation and recommend ways to further improve the treatment and prevention fronts.

As part of a proposal for installing CCTV cameras across the city, the LAD and Police department are mooting plans for separate installations under the Smart City and public health (monitoring safety protocol violations) initiatives.

199,2020/10/21,"Thanks to online classes, students get a break from exams","Focus is on completing portions, say teachers

Five months having passed since June, when most schools began their academic year virtually, many institutions have now started classes online for the second term as well.

The current set-up, however, has meant that a majority of schools have not been able to hold any major exams — the quarterly exams, that students write for 100 marks, have been done away with, and shorter tests have been introduced.

R. Vislakshi, president, Tamil Nadu Private Schools’ Association, said unit tests and short tests were preferred by many schools, since logistically, conducting a long paper virtually was challenging. “With the government also saying that students should not be compelled to take tests or attend online classes, shorter evaluation techniques like slip tests or unit tests were what we opted for,” she said.

Guidelines for online classes released by the State government had specified that while assessments could be carried out during the period, they should not be made mandatory or counted for the final grade.

At the Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School, students have been attending classes over Zoom. G.J. Manohar, principal, said they had given students the freedom to do assignments based on what was taught.

“We were keen on ensuring that learning continues in some way and this was an extension of that. This was in practice through the first term and we have just started our second term,” he said.

Concerns have been raised for students of Classes 10 and 12, who will take board examinations next year, and the need to have regular assessments and evaluations for them. “Most schools aren’t worried about conducting exams or testing the children in some way. The focus is more on completing the portions, since the pace of teaching has been a lot slower, so far, this year,” said a teacher from a private school. Several teachers’ associations and schools have been reiterating the need to make an early announcement on the reduced syllabus, which will help them structure the academic year better.

A few schools that have managed to hold quarterly exams virtually have done so only for senior students.

“For students of Classes 10 and 12, we considered it good practice, ahead of their board exams.

201,2020/10/21,"After a long interval, theatres look towards resuming shows","New releases unlikely if demands are not met: producers

After waiting for almost seven months, cinema hall owners in the State are eager to get back to business. They are waiting for the State government to give a go ahead, but film producers insist that it cannot be “business as usual” until the theatre owners agree to their many demands.

Members of the Tamil Film Active Producers’ Association (TFAPA) have placed three main demands, among others: abolish the virtual print fee (VPF); renegotiate theatrical revenue-sharing formula and provide a share in the revenue made via online ticketing.

VPF is a charge paid by the producer to digital service providers to screen movies in theatres.

Despite digital cinema service providers Qube Cinema and UFO Moviez announcing a flat 50% discount on VPF charges for a fixed number of weeks, TFAPA vice-president and producer G. Dhananjayan said its members were determined to abolish VPF.

“We have already placed the demands and theatre owners are yet to reply. We are unlikely to release new films until the issue is resolved,” he said.

Mr. Dhananjayan ruled out a situation where producers start releasing movies in theatres, while simultaneously engaging in talks with theatre owners over the key demands.

Favourable decision

Tiruppur Subramaniam, president, Tamil Nadu Theatre and Multiplex Owners’ Association, said he hoped to see producers coming forward to release new movies once the government orders the reopening of theatres. “We will have to meet the Chief Minister and place a request. We hope to get a favourable decision soon,” he said.

On the demands made by producers, Mr. Subramanian said he did not believe that they had renewed their demands on VPF and other issues. “I fully expect the producers to release new movies,” he said.

In a letter to TFAPA, Senthil Kumar, co-founder, Qube Cinema, urged the association to “address the issue in a wholesome manner so that we are not exclusively targeted by such a powerful and important body as yourselves”.

Addressing the charge by producers that they were being forced to pay VPF charges while Hollywood was exempted, Mr. Senthil said the VPF model followed in the United States, Europe and Australia was different from the one in India.

“Digital service providers there [in the U.S., Europe and Australia] charge a very high VPF of about $850 per digital print, about 90%-100% the cost of a film print [about ₹60,000-₹70,000]. The agreement entered into by the digital service providers with studios allow them to charge such high VPF rates, until they recover the cost of the digital cinema equipment, along with maintenance and support costs, and a reasonable return on investment. This is referred to as the recoupment model,” he said.

Explaining why the ‘recoupment model’ will not work in India, he said: “The rate charged per digital print is so low when compared to other international markets. The cost of equipment is even higher here because of the 35% import duties in the country, not just for the equipment, but also for all spares and consumables,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ivxtnp/article32904288.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THTHEATRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/after-a-long-interval-theatres-look-towards-resuming-shows/article32904289.ece

He received overwhelming support from the CPI (ML-New Democracy) and its frontal organisations including the PDSU besides various tribal youth organisations during his visit to the coal town of Kothagudem.

The senior CPI (ML-ND) leader and a five-time MLA from Yellandu Gummadi Narsaiah and a host of other party cadres participated in a meeting held in the coal town to muster support for the candidature of Mr Kodandaram from the Graduates constituency spread across the vast coal belt region and the Agency mandals of the district.

Addressing the participants, Mr Narsaiah exhorted the graduates to support Mr Kodandaram, the Telangana protagonist, who led the separate Telangana movement as the chairman of the TJAC in the past, to ensure that people's voice was heard in the Legislative Council and issues facing poor and downtrodden sections were highlighted.

205,2020/10/21,TRS should lose Dubbak in State’s interests: Jagga Reddy,"‘Harish Rao misusing official machinery’

Sangareddy MLA, T. Jagga Reddy has stated that TRS should lose Dubbak in the interests of the State and it was for the people to decide after the Congress has exposed the ruling party to the hilt in corruption, misgovernance.

Speaking to reporters here, he said Finance Minister, T. Harish Rao’s political career was at stake in the by-election and he was misusing the official machinery to campaign for the TRS candidate. He also alleged that Siddipet Collector, Venkatrami Reddy was breaching all norms to support the ruling party while some police officials too were working for the government.

Mr. Reddy said Dubbak voters should think twice while casting their vote and send a strong signal to the rulers that people cannot be taken for granted. “As an opposition party, we have exposed the ruling party and how it was damaging the state. It is for people to decide whether they want to vote for a government that makes hollow promises,” he said.

He wanted to know what happened to the students of Osmania University and Kakatiya University who played a key role in the Telangana movement? It is time they fight against the government’s failed assurance on employment and education apart from issues concerning the state.

The Congress leader said a strange political system was being practised in Telangana where people have to run after MLAs for solving the problems rather than MLAs being available to the people.

Despite the huge losses suffered by farmers due to the incessant rains neither the government nor the public representatives are able to give them any assurance of any help, he said",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/y9svqy/article31760975.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06JAGGA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trs-should-lose-dubbak-in-states-interests-jagga-reddy/article32910344.ece

Steps should be taken to ensure that the likely danger of tanks breaching or their bunds making way was averted.

Mr.Rao asked Mr. Rajat Kumar to form fifteen teams of engineers, officials and staff of irrigation department to check the condition of all the tanks and their bunds.

211,2020/10/21,PM Modi urged to tell States to drop sedition cases against journalists,"Letter to PM Modi says that in past few months, a number of journalists have been charged under Section 124A of IPC.

The International Press Institute (IPI), a global network of editors, media executives and journalists, along with the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ), in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urged him to direct the State governments to drop sedition cases against journalists.

Expressing “grave concern” at the recent arrest of Kerala-based journalist Siddique Kappan, who was trying to reach the family of a girl who died days after she was brutally assaulted and allegedly raped in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh, and other similar cases, the two organisations said the government must take immediate steps to ensure that journalists could work without any harassment and fear of reprisal from governments.

The letter said that in the past few months, a number of journalists have been charged under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code that lays down the punishment for sedition from three years to life term in prison.

The Section states that those, who by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise bring or attempt to bring in hatred or contempt, or attempt to excite disaffection towards the government established by law in India, could be punished with life imprisonment or for a period of three years in prison.

‘Rise in cases during pandemic’

“We find it extremely disturbing that governments in different States of India are attempting to stifle press freedom by filing cases against journalists under different sections of the Indian Penal Code. The number of cases filed against journalists increased enormously after the spread of the pandemic. The health crisis is being used as an excuse to silence those who have exposed shortcomings in the government’s response to it,” the organisations said in their letter.

A free media was essential for a successful public health response. As many as 55 journalists were targeted for covering the pandemic in India between March 25, when lockdown was first imposed, and May 31, a report by the Rights and Risks Analysis Group has shown, they noted in the letter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pm-modi-urged-to-tell-states-to-drop-sedition-cases-against-journalists/article32910565.ece
212,2020/10/21,"Bypolls: BJP, Congress intensify campaigning in Gujarat","Ruling party has fielded five Congress defectors and is facing heat on the issue

For the BJP and the Congress in Gujarat, the bypolls for eight Assembly seats have become a prestige battle with both leaving no stone unturned to win the maximum number. Both parties have intensified campaigning like holding small rallies and meetings to organising group meetings and door-to-door canvassing besides digital campaigning on social media platforms.

The eight seats are Abdasa, Morbi, Dhari, Karjan and Limbadi while three reserved seats are Gadhada (SC) and Dangs and Kaprada (ST). All seats were held by the Congress legislators, who resigned ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls and six of them joined the saffron party.

The BJP has fielded five Congress defectors: Brijesh Merja from Morbi, JV Kakadia from Dhari, Akshay Patel from Karjan, Pradhyumansinh Jadeja from Abdasa and Jitu Chaudhary from Kaprada. The party has preferred its own leaders from three seats: Kiritsinh Rana from Limbadi, Atmaram Parmar from Gadhada and Vijay Patel from Dangs.

Both Mr. Rana and Mr. Parmar are ex-Ministers and had lost to the Congress in the last Assembly polls in 2017 while Mr. Vijay Patel is a former legislator of the party.

The Congress has on the other hand fielded new faces like Kiritsinh Jadeja from Karjan, Chatan Khachar from Limbadi and Suryakant Gavit from Dangs. In Dhari, the party has fielded Suresh Kotadia, son of former Union Minister Manubhai Kotadia.

The BJP is fighting the polls on the plank of development works of the Centre and the State governments. However, the ruling party appears to be facing the issue of ‘importing’ Congress leaders at the cost of developing the local party leaders.

The Opposition party’s campaign theme is “betrayal of mandate” by the turncoats. On Wednesday, State Congress Chief Amit Chavda charged the BJP with “purchasing Opposition members” using the money power of the state.

“People of the eight seats deserve to know how much money was paid by the BJP to each of their legislators,” Mr. Chavda asked.

He said the electorate would teach them a lesson in the bypolls. Gujarat’s Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel retorted saying “the BJP has proof about how much money the Congress had offered to lure the BJP MLAs in the State”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/2yg39s/article32281216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THMain2NTHGGS17LA9IT3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bypolls-bjp-congress-intensify-campaigning-in-gujarat/article32910341.ece
213,2020/10/21,ITBP deputes first officer to head Guwahati-based eastern command along LAC,"The ITBP, with an estimated manpower of 90,000 personnel, had bolstered its presence all along the 3,488km-long LAC post these developments.

The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), which guards the LAC with China, has posted its first officer to head the newly-created Guwahati-based eastern command that oversees deployment of border battalions in that region.

Additional Director General Amrit Mohan Prasad, posted at the ITBP headquarters in New Delhi, has been transferred and posted as the ADG of the eastern command, an order issued on Tuesday by the Force said.

The Command, as per details accessed by PTI, overlooks ITBP battalions posted along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in States such as Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Assam with frontiers at Itanagar (northeast) and Lucknow (east) and sector offices at Likabali, Tezpur, Dibrugarh, Gangtok, among others.

The Command in Assam’s capital Guwahati also supervises ITBP battalions deployed for anti-Naxal operations in Chhattisgarh.

Some officers, sub-officers and administrative staff were earlier posted by the force to operationalise the command but the posting of the top officer was delayed, official sources said.

The mountain-warfare trained force had similarly posted an officer (in the Inspector General-rank) in June to head its western command located in Chandigarh that has control over battalions deployed along the LAC in Ladakh, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.

The two ADG-rank headed commands were sanctioned by the Union government in October last year for better operational functioning of the about 35-38 battalions of the force deployed at the LAC, starting from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh along the eastern front. The ITBP posts at this icy front are located at altitudes ranging from 9,000-18,700 feet.

Earlier, the border deployments of the force were headed by IG-rank officers at various frontier locations. The new commands will streamline operations, intelligence, deployment and administrative movements of ITBP personnel to the border regions and also bring better synergy with the Army that secures the LAC, a senior official had said earlier.

India and China currently have an ongoing standoff between their militaries in the Ladakh region. The ITBP, with an estimated manpower of 90,000 personnel, had bolstered its presence all along the 3,488-km-long LAC post these developments.

214,2020/10/21,"Will announce relief package soon, Uddhav Thackeray tells farmers","MVA govt. committed to restore your livelihood hit hard by the retreating monsoon, says Chief Minister

The Maha Vikas Aghadi government was committed to restore the livelihoods of farmers hit hard by the retreating monsoon, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Wednesday. He said his government would soon be announcing a relief package.

Speaking after touring rain-hit Osmanabad in the Marathwada, Mr. Thackeray said he had not come there to announce any random figure merely for the sake of garnering applause. He said the State Cabinet would be meeting in a day or two to decide on the modalities of the relief that would be given to the affected people.

“The situation is terrible. Crops and livelihoods have been destroyed…I am aware that you all have come here with a lot of expectations from me about when and how much will be the package that is announced. But I cannot announce anything that I will not fulfil. Today, I have come to reassure everybody that the government is with you... the spot inspections are nearly 80-90% over and we have received an estimate,” the Chief Minister said in Katgaon village.

Saying the Maha Vikas Aghadi government was committed to restore normalcy in the lives of the farmers as soon as possible, Mr. Thackeray also said the India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials had informed him that the threat of heavy rainfall had now waned, with only the possibility of lightning over the next seven to eight days.

“This year has been a catalogue of calamities — first COVID-19, then floods in Vidarbha and now heavy rains in other parts of the State…I am here to review the losses and to assure you that the government is with you. The soil has eroded in a number of places owing to heavy rains...help will be given as soon as possible.”

Mr. Thackeray has been under pressure from the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Leader of the Opposition (LoP) Devendra Fadnavis, who has been relentlessly targeting the Chief Minister and the leadership of the MVA government demanding to know why the State government had not yet announced a relief package for the farmers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vbncg7/article32880712.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MAHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/will-announce-relief-package-soon-uddhav-thackeray-tells-farmers/article32908936.ece
215,2020/10/21,J&K district council polls soon,"Union Cabinet approves adoption of Panchayati Raj Act for the Union Territory.

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the adoption of the Jammu and Kashmir Panchayati Raj Act, 1989, which was amended and notified by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on October 17.

The amendment paves the way for the creation of District Development Councils (DDCs), whose members will be directly elected by the people.

“The move will help establish all the three tiers of grass roots-level democracy in the Union Territory (UT) like in other parts of the country,” said Union Minister Prakash Javadekar.

“The three-tier system was not there in Kashmir before. They did not have the opportunity to elect their local representatives. This step redeems the promise made by the Prime Minister in Kashmir, and the Home Minister in Parliament. Now there will be early elections, and the power to manage local bodies will go to the people. Locally elected representatives will be able to do district and block level planning, and implement welfare schemes,” Mr. Javadekar noted.

As per the amendment, the DDCs will have jurisdiction over the entire district, excluding those areas designated as municipalities or municipal corporations.

Political parties’ concern

Political parties in J&K have expressed concern that this will limit the MLAs’ role. The Assembly was dissolved in November 2018. Last year, the special status of the former State under Article 370 of the Constitution was revoked and it was downgraded and bifurcated into UTs- J&K and Ladakh, the latter without an assembly. Currently J&K is under the administrative control of the Lieutenant Governor.

The order issued after the amendment says, “Every district will be divided into 14 territorial constituencies to elect members of the body. The DDC shall consist of the directly elected members from territorial constituencies in the district, members of the Legislative Assembly representing a part or whole of the district whose constituencies lie within the district and the Chairperson of all Block Development Councils of the district”.

“All DDC members, whether or not elected by direct election from the territorial constituencies in the district, shall have the right to vote in the meeting of the District Development Council,” reads the amendment.

216,2020/10/21,Swaraj India report highlights deficiencies in kharif crop procurement in Haryana,"It offers 17 suggestions to the government for improvement

Delayed payments, grossly insufficient numbers of farmers scheduled for sales per day, arbitrary quantitative limits on procurement and the lack of a grievance redress system are some of the problems highlighted by Jai Kisan Andolan and Swaraj Abhiyan in their report on deficiencies in the ongoing procurement process for kharif crops in Haryana. The report also offers 17 suggestions to the government for improvement.

Titled ‘Deficiencies in Procurement System and Difficulties Faced by Farmers in Haryana,’ the report has been handed over to Haryana Agriculture Minister Jai Prakash Dalal in Bhiwani by a delegation of Swaraj India led by its national president Yogendra Yadav.

Referring to the inconvenience faced by the farmers due to the new software and alleged wrong policies of the government, Mr. Yadav attracted the attention of the minister to the fact that none of farmers was paid for the crops procured so far. He said that Swaraj India would be forced to launch an agitation if the government failed to address the farmers’ grievances.

Based on the Swaraj Abhiyan team’s visit to a dozen mandis across six districts in South Haryana, the report claimed that notwithstanding the government’s claim to make payment within 72 hours, they “did not come across any farmer or trader who supported this claim”, adding that “the impression we gathered is that yet no farmer has received the payment in their account. This is putting farmers to great distress in this festival and wedding season. This delay acts as severe disincentive for the farmers and pushes them towards the private traders at severe losses”.

The report pointed out that only 5-11% of the total registered farmers in four districts – Bhiwani, Mahendragarh, Charkhi Dadri and Rewari – had managed to sell their crops in the first two weeks of the six-week procurement session. The slow procurement process forced the farmers to sell their crop to private traders at a price much lesser than Minimum Support Price and the commission agents were also forced to work much below their capacity. It suggested that 500-600 farmers be scheduled per day and all registered farmers cleared by mid-November. “Purchase must take place on all days, without any break for holidays,” the report said.

The report argued that the eight quintal and 33 quintal per acre limit on procurement of bajra and paddy respectively was irrational and punished the farmers for producing more. It said the limit fixed using the arithmetic average of the production in the state defied logic and the ceiling, if imposed, should be the upper end of statistical range.

The report said the online registration at “Meri Fasal Mera Byora” had increased, but in backward areas like Mewat, many farmers were still not aware about the requirement of registration and thus lost out on this opportunity for a fair price for their produce. “In the previous years we had noticed a clear system of grievance redress...this time we did not find public notification of grievance committee in any of mandis we visited,” said the report.

Among important suggestions, the report demanded that the farmers are sent a voice message along with an SMS to inform them of their scheduled date for procurement at least two days in advance, the schedule for the entire period of procurement must be prepared and made public, penal interest be paid at 18% per annum to farmers in case of delayed payment and commission agents must be authorised to purchase cotton on behalf of Cotton Corporation of India in those mandis where there are no corporation centres.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8s1t9q/article32907306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KHARIF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/swaraj-india-report-highlights-deficiencies-in-kharif-crop-procurement-in-haryana/article32907307.ece
217,2020/10/21,Madhya Pradesh police register case against Minister for making derogatory remark,"Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Minister Bisahulal Singh reportedly made a derogatory remark against the wife of his Congress contender in the coming byelection.

The Anuppur police have registered a case against Madhya Pradesh Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Minister Bisahulal Singh for reportedly making a derogatory remark against the wife of his Congress contender in the coming byelection.

The case was registered after hundreds of women, led by the wife of Congressman Vishwanath Singh against whom the remarks were made, marched to a police station on Tuesday. The case has been registered under Sections 294 (Obscene acts and songs) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, according to the FIR.

In a video that went viral on the social media on Monday, Mr. Bisahulal Singh is heard saying, “When nomination papers are filed, you give out details of properties. However, Vishwanath Singh [Congress candidate] has not provided details of his first wife. He has given details of his rakhail (mistress). It should be found out where his first wife is.”

Home Minister apologises

Meanwhile, Home Minister Narottam Mishra came forward to tender an apology. “I have not seen the video, but if anyone is hurt owing to the remarks, I apologise.”

Mr. Bisahulal Singh was among the 22 Congress MLAs who quit the party in March, precipitating the fall of the Kamal Nath government, and later switched over to the BJP.

While stating he would file a defamation suit against the Minister, Mr. Vishwanath Singh said, “The remarks expose his character. I have been married for 15 years and have a daughter, and his remarks have hurt the entire family.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/h4cpy6/article32853502.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THMain2NTHGGS17LA9IT3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/madhya-pradesh-police-register-case-against-minister-for-making-derogatory-remark/article32907111.ece

Anti-triple talaq crusader Shayara Bano, who recently joined the BJP, has been given minister of state status by the Uttarakhand government.

The move comes just ten days after Bano, who was the first Muslim woman to question the constitutionality of the practice of triple talaq in the Supreme Court, joined the BJP here in the presence of its Pradesh president Bansidhar Bhagat and a host of other leaders.

Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat’s media coordinator Darshan Singh Rawat said, “Bano is among three women, who were appointed vice presidents of the State Women’s Commission besides being accorded MoS status on Tuesday.”

The other two women appointed to the post are Jyoti Shah from Ranikhet in Almora district and Pushpa Paswan from Chamoli district.

The three posts in the commission had long been vacant.

“It is the chief minister’s gift to the women of the state during Navratri,” he said.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday said his government will bring a bill against the Centre’s farm laws on the lines of Punjab.

The Chief Minister announced this on Twitter, hours after the Punjab assembly unanimously passed four bills and adopted a resolution against the Union government laws.

INC under the leadership of Smt #SoniaGandhi ji& #RahulGandhi ji stands absolutely with our annadatas and will continue to oppose the anti-farmer laws passed by NDA Govt. Today Congress Govt in #Punjab has passed Bills against these laws & #Rajasthan will follow soon, Gehlot tweeted on Tuesday night.

Earlier, the Congress leadership had suggested states where the party is in power to pass laws of their own, negating the central legislation.

In the meeting of the State council of Ministers held at the Chief Minister’s residence, the effects of Centre’s three new laws on the farmers were discussed.

The council of Ministers decided that a special session of the Legislative Assembly will be convened soon and amendment bills will be brought to preserve the interests of the farmers, an official statement said.

The council also emphasised on the imperative of procurement of crops at minimum support price (MSP).

The council observed that the removal of the maximum limit of stock of various agricultural commodities under normal circumstances under the Essential Commodities Act after the implementation of the new agricultural laws will increase black marketing, unauthorised storage and rise in prices.

It was also discussed in the meeting that the provision of MSP in the Contract Forming Act will be in the interest of the farmers of the state, the statement said.

The meeting also discussed the coronavirus situation in the state government’s efforts to deal with it.

222,2020/10/21,Former ACP moves court against Republic TV,"Suit seeks to restrain the channel from discussing the TRP case

A former Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Iqbal Shaikh, filed a suit before the city civil and sessions court on Tuesday seeking a restraint on Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami from defaming the Mumbai Police and undermining the probe in the Television Rating Points (TRP) manipulation case, in which the channel is accused.

The suit has been filed by Mr. Shaikh through advocate Abha Singh, stating that “allegation pertained to the fact where meters placed at individual homes for determining TRP were rigged by offering illicit inducements to the households where the said meters were placed. These meters provided the viewership details of the channel view by individual homes. Through this process of rigging, individual channels would get higher rating i.e. TRP and thus higher advertisement revenue”.

On October 8, Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh said a TRP racket was busted by the Crime Branch, which involved Republic TV, Box Cinema and Fakt Marathi.

In the suit, the ACP seeks remedies for a ‘sustained campaign’ of defamation being directed against the Mumbai Police. The 92-page-suit states, “In complete violation of the norms of journalistic conduct by Mr. Goswami who have been made subject to such probe in a statutory investigation, a smear campaign of a sustained nature has been launched by the Republic TV against the Mumbai Police and which in turn has aggrieved Mr. Shaikh.”

Mr. Shaikh wants a permanent injunction, restraining them from either directly or indirectly discussing or referring to the case under investigation, and seeks ₹5 lakhs as damages for causing mental agony and loss of reputation to the Mumbai Police.

The suit also emphasises the statutory guidelines issued by the Press Council of India (PCI), which state that the same person cannot be the owner of a media establishment as well as the editor because ownership and editorial control have to be independent of each other. Mr. Goswami triples up, first as the owner and director of the media company, second as the editor-in-chief, and third as an anchor, which is an open contempt of the guidelines of PCI, the suit states.

The matter will be heard on October 21.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/former-acp-moves-court-against-republic-tv/article32904839.ece
223,2020/10/21,Two AMU doctors have service ‘terminated’ for speaking to the media,"Services are temporary so there is no question of termination or suspension, says University spokesperson

Two doctors of Aligarh Muslim University’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital (JNMCH) alleged on Tuesday that their services had been terminated because they “unofficially” gave statements to the media on the Hathras murder and alleged gang-rape case.

AMU officials said that it was a “routine affair” and had nothing to do with the Hathras case.

Dr. Mohammad Azimuddin Malik said his and his colleague Dr. Obaid Imtiyazul Haque’s services as Casualty Medical Officers (CMO) were terminated by Vice-Chancellor Professor Tariq Mansoor on Tuesday.

The letter signed by CMO In-Charge Dr. S.A.H Zaidi said the Vice-Chancellor had rejected their appointment to the post of Medical Officer-Emergency and Trauma with immediate effect.

“We understand that ours is a temporary job against leave vacancy, which is renewed every month. My month ended on October 10. Since then, I have been made to understand by seniors that I am supposed to continue. I have been signing on medico-legal cases. If I have been removed with immediate effect, who is going to appear in the cases of the last 10 days?” Dr. Malik asked.

He further said that after his opinion on a forensic lab report was published, he was asked to give a written explanation. “I refused to give any statement [to the media] but when the journalist asked my personal opinion I told her that chances of getting an important finding is more if the sample is collected within four days of the incident than when its collected after 11 days,” he said in the letter.

Dr. Malik alleged that he and Dr. Haque were being targeted because both of them had spoken to the media. He said that he had learnt their In-Charge had been called and reprimanded by the V-C.

He further said the newspaper had wrongly mentioned his designation as Chief Medical Officer. “There is no such post in the JNMCH. There are 11 Casualty Medical Officers and there is one In- Charge,” said Dr. Malik, who has specialised in Ophthalmology this year.

Shafey Kidwai, University spokesperson, said the V-C was reconsidering the decision, and if the CMO In-Charge asked for an extension of their services, it would be considered. “It is a routine affair. Their services are temporary so there is no question of termination or suspension. They were appointed when the cases of COVID-19 were increasing, against leave vacancy. Now that the pressure has eased and some of the regular doctors have resumed duties, their services might not be required. It has nothing to do with the Hathras probe,” said Professor Kidwai.

Sources said the university’s decision to reconsider seemed to be an afterthought because of the medico-legal cases as the rejection from the V-C could only come after the In-Charge had approved of their services for the month.

Dr. Hamza Malik, president of the Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA), demanded that the doctors should be “reinstated within 24 hours”, or else the RDA would take a “big decision”. “We have been assured over the phone that they will be reinstated, but we will not relent until we get it in writing,” he said.

In a related development, a Central Bureau of Investigation team quizzed the JNMCH doctors who treated the victim on Monday.

225,2020/10/21,Amit Shah meets Nagaland leaders,"Naga peace pact is expected to be finalised soon

Union Home Minister Amit Shah had a meeting with Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio and Leader of the Opposition T.R. Zeliang in Delhi on Tuesday to discuss the Naga peace pact that may be finalised soon.

Mr. Rio later met National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) chief Thuingaleng Muivah, who has been camping in Delhi since July after refusing to hold any dialogue with Naga interlocutor R.N. Ravi.

Mr. Shah is learnt to have asked Mr. Zeliang to rejoin the Joint Legislators’ Forum and endorse the “one solution” resolution of the Naga political issue signed by over 150 civil society groups and individuals on October 15.

In November 2017, the Centre had created the Forum, comprising all the 60-members of the Nagaland Assembly, to assist the Naga peace process.

Mr. Zeliang is also the leader of the Naga People’s Front (NPF), the chief Opposition party that had walked out of the Forum in August due to “huge trust deficit”.

Peace talks in trouble

The peace talks hit a rough weather in August after Mr. Muivah refused to hold any dialogue with Mr. Ravi, who is also the State Governor. A team of Intelligence Bureau officials was deputed to hold the discussions with the NSCN(I-M). Mr. Ravi and the NSCN(I-M) signed a framework agreement on August 3, 2015, in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The NSCN(I-M) has been demanding a separate constitution and a flag for the Nagas and the assimilation of all Naga inhabited areas in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur. In 2017, Mr. Ravi included more Naga groups in the dialogue process and signed a preamble with the seven Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs). Mr. Ravi continues the negotiations with the NNPG.

The NNPG issued a statement on Tuesday, accusing the NSCN(I-M) of delaying the talks.

“After 23 years of political talks, when a negotiator declares that Nagas do not accept the Union of India or the Indian Constitution, it could only mean political dialogue was a circus exercise for personal gains. The much touted FA [framework] agreement of 2015, by the very utterance, becomes invalid. Whether an emotional outburst or otherwise, the organisation owes an explanation to the Naga people. It reeks of a despotic, incoherent, unreliable and anti-people character and mind,” said N. Kitovi Zhimomi, convener, NNPG, said in a statement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xe2cd0/article32904735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TH-AMIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amit-shah-meets-nagaland-leaders/article32904736.ece

“As a one-time measure, if the idol of the committee has already been constructed beyond four feet and having connection with the rituals of Shree Jagannath Temple, which has got special status in Odisha, this Court does not want to disturb the same and allows the petitioner (Satasahi Puja Committee) to go ahead with puja,” said an order delivered on Tuesday by a Division Bench headed by Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq.

227,2020/10/21,BSP will emerge as kingmaker in M.P. bypolls: State party chief,"‘Atrocities against Dalits, custodial deaths among key campaign issues’

Madhya Pradesh Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Ramakant Pippal has exuded confidence that the party would pose a tough fight to the BJP and the Congress in the forthcoming by-election and emerge as kingmaker.

“Voters have lost faith in both the parties,” Mr. Pippal told The Hindu. “While they voted out the BJP in 2018 as it didn’t keep its promises over the years, the Congress betrayed their mandate as they couldn’t keep their flock together and defections brought down the government.”

In 2018, the BSP secured two seats in the Vidhan Sabha and supported the Congress to form the government along with four independent MLAs and the lone Samajwadi Party legislator. When asked which way the party will swing this time, Mr. Pippal claimed, “We will hold the key to the government. Behenji (BSP president Mayawati) will take a call later.” While the BJP requires nine seats to retain government, the Congress needs to bag all the seats to return to power single-handedly.

To canvass for candidates on the 28 seats, nine reserved for Scheduled Castes (SC) and two for Scheduled Tribe candidates, the BSP will raise the issues of continuing atrocities against Dalits, including the Hathras case, custodial deaths in the State, plight of migrant workers in the Gwalior-Chambal region during the lockdown and inability of the Congress to implement 27% Other Backward Classes reservation in government jobs and educational institutions, which has been challenged in court.

The Congress also hadn’t kept its promise of dropping cases against Dalit youth for reportedly taking part in the April 2018 protests against the Supreme Court order on the atrocities Act, Mr. Pippal claimed.

This time, two former Congress leaders are contesting on a BSP ticket in the Gwalior-Chambal region. Congress sources said former State Congress Scheduled Castes wing president Mahendra Boddh was likely to be a strong contender against Congressman Phool Singh Baraiya, a former BSP leader, on the Bhander seat.

The BSP enjoyed support in the Chambal and Vindhya Pradesh, especially among Jatavs, said Yatindra Singh Sisodia, director, Madhya Pradesh Institute of Social Science Research, Ujjain. “The party has a committed vote of 2.5-12% which favours it irrespective of the candidate,” he said.

The conservative idea that the BSP’s strong performance caused the Congress damage wasn’t applicable to Madhya Pradesh anymore, he said. “Dalits don’t just vote for the BSP or the Congress. The BJP, through social engineering, has been able to secure a sizeable non-Jatav vote over the years.” According to the CSDS-Madhya Pradesh Post-Poll Survey 2018, the BJP enjoyed the support of 25% SC voters, the Congress 48% and the BSP 19%.

Still, the BSP vote share has declined over the years in Madhya Pradesh, from 7.26% in 2003 to 5.07% in 2018. In the previous election, the party registered its strongest presence in Chambal, securing 13.08% of the vote on 35 seats. Most voters in the 26-35 years age group, at 28%, across the State supported the BSP in the 2018 election, according to the survey.

‘Dalits with Congress’

Dismissing the BSP role in the by-election, Congress media in-charge for the Gwalior-Chambal region K.K. Mishra said Dalits would favour the Congress for the pro-poor policies of the erstwhile Kamal Nath government. “We have kept the election promise of waiving crop loans of farmers, including those from the SCs,” he said.

Meanwhile, BJP spokesman Pankaj Chaturvedi said Rajya Sabha M.P. Jyotiraditya Scindia and his supporters enjoyed considerable support among the Dalits. “If at all, BSP’s strong presence will damage the Congress,” he claimed.

The by-elections were necessitated after 25 Congress MLAs, 19 pledging support to Mr. Scindia, joined the BJP, while three seats fell vacant after deaths of sitting MLAs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sjtwcp/article32904244.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE21RALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bsp-will-emerge-as-kingmaker-in-mp-bypolls-state-party-chief/article32904245.ece
228,2020/10/21,BS Desai’s paintings on display at Sublime Galleria,"The exhibition, titled Enigmatical Light, will be on till November 8

Curiosity about life and death, his practice of yoga and the mysteries of Nature influence the canvas of BS Desai. The artist believes his life and dreams are an integral part of his art.

Counting his mother as a source of inspiration, Desai says, “She stitched bits and pieces of cloth to create a beautiful kaudi (quilt). My paintings are the same, bringing in all hues of life.”

Desai, born in 1965 at Chiraladinni in Vijayapura district, was attracted to art at a young age. He studied Fine Arts and took photography as his profession for a brief period, before getting recruited as a drawing teacher in a Government school.

As a teacher, Desai tries to make his students aware of the need to conserve Nature. He often takes them on field trips to tanks, lakes and rivers and has photographed many rare birds that visit Hunasinakere tank in Hassan. “Not only birds but butterflies too travel long distances. I have spent long hours amidst these creatures,” he says.

Enigmatical Light, an exhibition of his paintings, is on at Sublime Galleria at UB City in Bengaluru till November 8.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/khdjws/article32906888.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Desai-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/bs-desais-paintings-on-display-at-sublime-galleria/article32906890.ece
229,2020/10/21,Highlights from Dutch Design Week,"At the virtual edition of Dutch Design Week, check out light installations, living coffins and hats that could help you social distance

Last year, over 3,55,000 people had converged at Eindhoven in the Netherlands for Dutch Design Week (DDW). That’s exactly why this year, the 19th edition of the annual event has gone virtual, with 3D viewing rooms, live streams and over 360 videos.

The pandemic has also dictated the main theme of the festival. The New Intimacy explores “a new equilibrium in a time when, due to Covid-19, the creative world has been accelerating the exploration of different ways of relating to each other and the world around us”.

Also Read The Mootu lounger at Dutch Design Week

On the fair’s website, tune into talks by its ambassadors — trend forecaster Lidewij Edelkoort, designer Sabine Marcelis, and Philips’ Chief Design Officer Sean Carney — on design trends, tactility in the digital age, and the future of healthcare. Dezeen, the architecture and design magazine, has also collaborated with DDW for a series of live discussions, including Stories of a Product (discussing how good design can improve people’s relationship with products).

Here are a few highlights from the festival.

Ananya Patel’s Topi-Cology

Inspired by birds that gather materials from their immediate environment to build nests, the Vadodara-based artist has used things from nature to create a series of hats. Seen here is the Neem Halo, one of the exhibits at Duth Invertuals’ True Matter show. The wide-brimmed hat is made with bamboo, banana stem and the bark of a neem tree that fell during the monsoon. It “offers shelter from the heat and insects”, explains the designer on an Instagram post and shares, tongue-in-cheek, that the neem’s distinct smell may also “keep people away”, an advantage in our times of social distancing.

Sabine Marcelis’ Virtual Tactility

The Dutch designer explores how one can translate physical objects — a series of polished resin and onyx marble stacked tables and totem lights — into a remote experience. With her ‘digital interaction’, created in collaboration with tech partners 5GHUB and Dimenco Displays, virtual visitors can control cameras placed in a remote gallery and experience Marcelis’ work.

With this site-specific installation, designers Nicola Charlesworth and Kim Stanek redefine an element of waste — dead-stock lenses from ophthalmic optics company Essilor — while paying tribute to one of Eindhoven’s most iconic buildings, De Bruin Heer. The duo examined the optician’s process and production (the building houses Mr Brown Specs & Beans, a luxury optician and coffee cafe) to create the installation that “seeks to reinstate each lens’ inherent beauty and value, [while] the distortion of the light source highlights the unique optical properties of each lens”.

Studio Hendrikx’s Living Coffin

This isn’t meant to be macabre, but rather a way to become one with nature. Using mycelium — the root network of mushrooms that inventor-biodesigner Bob Hendrikx says continuously transform “dead organic matter into fresh plant food” — the coffin brings humans into the cycle of life, helping humans enrich the soil instead of polluting it.

233,2020/10/21,Traders seek reoccupation of Then Vadal Street in Coimbatore,"Civic body yet to take a decision on the request

The Then Vadal Street that the Coimbatore Corporation cleared of encroachments has once again become the focus point with two groups attempting reoccupation.

The Corporation, following a court order, had removed 85 makeshift vegetable vendors who had encroached upon the Street, which is next to the T.K. Market, in June this year. It also removed the barricades on eastern and western side of the Street to widen the road width. The Corporation did not stop with that, though. It provided two alternative vending places for the evicted traders but they were reluctant to move to either of the place – the first was a two-wheeler parking lot west of the Market and the second was in Ukkadam.

Now, a section of the evicted traders had approached the Corporation saying that they would like to temporarily reoccupy the Then Vadal Street – till Deepavali – so that they could earn some money during the festive season.

Sources in the Corporation said the traders had also met the powers that be and claimed that they had political patronage.

Opposed to the demand, another section of traders said if at all the Corporation were to permit the traders, then they too should have a fair share of the road space and demanded that their members be given 50% of the space.

As the claim and counter-claim gained communal angle, the Corporation informed the Coimbatore City Police, which, the Corporation sources said, thwarted attempts by traders to reoccupy the Street on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The sources said the civic body was yet to take a decision on allowing the traders to set shop on the Street.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/traders-seek-reoccupation-of-then-vadal-street-in-coimbatore/article32912220.ece
234,2020/10/21,Transgender entrepreneur found murdered in Coimbatore,"Police Commissioner forms three special teams to crack the case

M. Sangeetha (59), a transgender entrepreneur and head of one of the transgenders’ associations in Coimbatore district, was found murdered at her residence on N.S.R. Road in Saibaba Colony here on Wednesday.

Police found her body in a plastic drum that was used to store water, after they were informed of foul smell emanating from the house.

Police said the body bore two stab injuries and a cut on the left side of the neck. The body was shifted to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital for post-mortem after inquest.

Transgenders associated with Sangeetha told the police that they last heard from her on Sunday, after which her phone was not reachable.

Coimbatore City Police Commissioner Sumit Saran formed three special teams to investigate the murder.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) G. Stalin said no one had gone to the rented house where Sangeetha stayed on Monday and Tuesday. The motive for murder was yet to be ascertained, he said.

The special teams questioned several persons, including transgenders who worked at Covai Trans Kitchen, a biriyani joint started last month under the leadership of Sangeetha on East Venketaswamy Road at R.S. Puram.

Before starting the venture, Sangeetha was undertaking catering work.

235,2020/10/21,Traders expect onion price to drop,"Big onions imported from Egypt

With big onions imported from Egypt by private traders reaching several markets in the country on Wednesday, this was reflected in the local wholesale price.

In Coimbatore markets, big onion that was sold at ₹90 a kg (wholesale) on Tuesday dropped to ₹ 80 a kg by Wednesday evening. The prices may decline to ₹70 a kg on Thursday. However, the real impact on domestic prices will be known in a week, depending on the consumer off-take of the imported onion, say traders.

A wholesale trader from the city said traders were less likely to hoard onion now as the varieties that currently come to markets could not be stocked for many days.

“The damage is high for the onion varieties that are currently sold in the market. Rains in onion producing States and COVID-19 induced crisis leading to less cultivation are said to be the reasons for the price hike,” said the trader.

Members of the All India Democratic Women's Association in Coimbatore staged a protest on Wednesday, demanding that the Central and State governments bring down the prices.

236,2020/10/21,‘Coimbatore Corporation had little to show to NGT committee on progress in waste management’,"Officials told to speed up the construction of micro compost centres

The State Level Monitoring Committee of National Green Tribunal for Solid Waste Management in Tamil Nadu has asked the Coimbatore Corporation to speed up the steps it had promised to take to decentralise solid waste management.

Committee Chairman Justice (retd.) P. Jyothimani briefly reviewed on Tuesday the progress the Corporation had made since the last meeting in January this year. After taking stock of the current situation, he told the Corporation officials to speed up the construction of micro compost centres and widen the coverage of door-to-door collection of segregated waste.

He cautioned the Corporation officials that he would not be lenient on the issue at the next meeting of the committee, sources privy to the development said.

The sources further said that since the last meeting, the Corporation had very little to show in terms of progress, partly due to COVID-19 pandemic control work. But even otherwise, the Corporation that could have completed the micro compost centres work did not show progress on that front too.

The Corporation could have easily extended the door-to-door collection of segregated waste to all the 100 wards as the COVID-19 lockdown provided an excellent opportunity for the civic body, they said.

Collecting waste that was not segregated led to open dumping at the Vellalore yard. Expressing concern over this, the Chairman told the Corporation that this practice should be stopped, the sources said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/udtone/article32912182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB22WASTECOLLECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-corporation-had-little-to-show-to-ngt-committee-on-progress-in-waste-management/article32912183.ece

Sources said that this surprise inspection conducted in the Central Zone was based on instructions from the district collector and Corporation commissioner ahead of the festive season. In the coming days, there would be many such inspections in all the five zones.

Shop managers should ensure that customers did not spend more than 30 minutes in textile or jewellery showrooms, and should insist them to not bring along senior citizens.

A private hospital in the district, in coordination with the Police Department, facilitated speedy transport of a kidney harvested from a brain-dead man in Madurai and transplanted it in a woman here on Tuesday.

Jegadamani (45) of Karur district was suffering from renal failure for the last two years and was undergoing dialysis at Abirami Kidney Care Hospital at Karur.

The inexperienced young guns of both Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad would like to put their hands up in testing times when both teams square off in a must-win Indian Premier League game on Thursday.

Whether it is Priyam Garg, Abdul Samad of Sunrisers or Kartik Tyagi, Riyan Parag of the Royals, the youngsters from both sides will be feeling the pressure of doing something out of the box in case their illustrious seniors fail in that pursuit.

Royals would hope to continue with the winning momentum and will expect their foreign recruits to perform like they did against CSK.

While Jofra Archer continues to be the backbone of Royals’ bowling attack, the wrist-spinning duo of Shreyas Gopal and Rahul Tewatia were terrific in the middle overs against CSK.

In batting, Jos Buttler looked in ominous form the other night, forcing skipper Smith to play the second fiddle but RR would need more consistent partnerships upfront.

244,2020/10/21,"Indian Premier League 2020, KKR VS RCB | Destructive Siraj leads Royal Challengers’ rout of Knight Riders","Pacer’s opening spell of 3-2-2-3 hurts Kolkata, which can only manage 84 for eight; Kohli’s men win with 6.3 overs to spare and move to second

Mohammed Siraj steamrollered Kolkata Knight Riders with a blistering fast-bowling display (4-2-8-3) at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. The 84 runs that KKR managed for the loss of eight wickets was the lowest total in IPL history for a team that wasn’t bowled out. Royal Challengers Bangalore romped home with eight wickets and more than six overs to spare.

Pat Cummins was economical in the PowerPlay (3-0-18-0) but KKR needed wickets. Lockie Ferguson, who had impressed against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday, was introduced only in the seventh over, by which point Devdutt Padikkal and Aaron Finch had slashed the target by half and there was no turning around.

The win lifted Virat Kohli’s men to second spot (14 points), ever closer to the playoffs, which has eluded the side since 2016.

For KKR (10 points), the crushing defeat can potentially drag it into the scrap for the last playoff position.

Striking gold

Kohli lost the toss, but struck gold with every roll of the dice, right from selecting Siraj in place of Shahbaz Ahmed, to the bowling changes he rang in through the contest. KKR never recovered from Siraj’s opening spell (3-2-2-3).

The pacer made full use of the moderate swing, and was aided by some impulsive batting.

KKR scored just 17 runs in the PowerPlay for the loss of four wickets. Rahul Tripathi went first, caught by A.B. de Villiers while trying to glide an away-going delivery from Siraj to third-man.

Nitish Rana was out next ball when he pushed forward without accounting for the movement, only for the ball to curl in and hit the off-stump.

Navdeep Saini, the first-change bowler, excised Shubman Gill.

Tom Banton, who replaced Andre Russell, drove a half-volley beautifully down the ground and then sent Saini soaring over the deep square-leg boundary. But his counter-attack was short-lived, caught by de Villiers when he swung at Siraj without moving his feet.

Siraj’s first two overs were both maidens, the first time in IPL history anyone had done so. These were superb returns for someone who has often attracted criticism for being profligate.

Then, the Yuzvendra Chahal-Washington Sundar double act suffocated KKR, with just 16 runs coming off six overs (nine to 14). Chahal trapped Dinesh Karthik leg-before with a googly that spun slightly and then outwitted Cummins with a teaser.

When Washington snuffed out Morgan (30, 34b, 3x4, 1x6) in the 16th over, all hopes of a KKR recovery had evaporated.

Chennai Super Kings all-rounder Dwayne Bravo has been ruled out of the ongoing IPL with a groin injury, dealing a massive blow to the already struggling side which has very slim chances of advancing to the play-offs.

The 37-year-old Bravo, an integral part of the CSK team for years now, couldn’t bowl the final over against Delhi Capitals in a match in Sharjah on October 17.

Skipper MS Dhoni was forced to bowl Ravindra Jadeja, who conceded three sixes.

“Dwayne Bravo is ruled out of the IPL due to a groin injury,” CSK CEO Kashi Viswanathan told PTI.

Bravo played six games and scored only seven runs in two innings. However, he got six wickets in as many games with an economy rate of 8.57.

CSK’s campaign has already been derailed after seven losses from 10 games. They are currently currently lying at the bottom of the league table.

Chennai Super Kings were already hamstrung by absence of senior players Suresh Raina and Harbhajan Singh, both of whom pulled out citing personal reasons.

The poor form of some of the senior players like skipper Dhoni and Kedar Jadhav has also hurt their cause.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/2j212l/article32907644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRAVO,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-dwayne-bravo-ruled-out-of-ipl-with-groin-injury-csk-ceo/article32907645.ece
246,2020/10/21,Jason Holder sad that ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement not part of IPL,"The ‘taking a knee’ gesture started in the West Indies’ Test series in England this summer, but the gesture was later discontinued for the subsequent series against Pakistan and Australia

West Indies captain Jason Holder has expressed his disappointment over none of the IPL teams “taking a knee” in solidarity with the “Black Lives Matter” movement, which has been completely ignored in world’s most glamorous league.

Holder, who is member of the IPL team Sunrisers Hyderabad, made the statement while receiving the prestigious Peter Smith Award on behalf of the West Indies cricket team in a virtual programme organised by the Cricket Writers’ Club.

The Peter Smith Award is an annual honour which recognises outstanding contribution to the presentation of cricket to the public.

“To be honest, I haven’t had one conversation up here around it (BLM). Sometimes it seems it has gone unnoticed, which is a sad thing. I guess it’s for us to re-highlight the importance of it, for people to understand what is happening in the world,” Holder said in his address posted on Cricket West Indies website.

“COVID-19 has obviously caused a lot of attention around it, there’s suddenly a lot of attention on the elections in America as well, too. But for us, particularly as black people in the Caribbean, a black-dominant society, it’s for us to continue the education.

“Cricket West Indies has done an excellent job in continuing awareness of it. The women had a series in England where they wore the Black Lives Matter logo and continued to push the movement as well,” he added.

The “taking a knee” gesture started in the West Indies’ Test series in England this summer in protest against racism after Black American George Floyd was killed by an on-duty white police officer in Minneapolis.

But the gesture was later discontinued for the subsequent series against Pakistan and Australia.

“I personally was a bit disappointed to see how the Pakistan and Australia tours went on after us and they’re not showing their solidarity. But it’s a long debate, a long hard challenge, a long road. We as people need to continue to come together, put our minds together and genuinely find ways to fix the inequalities in the world,” Holder said.

“It’s not an overnight fix. This is something that is going to be ongoing for maybe a number of years. But I think the most important thing is that we need to come together, we need to see each other as all equal human beings and treat each other that way, and be your brother’s keeper in this world.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/9lnrl7/article32907192.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HOLDERBLM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jason-holder-sad-that-black-lives-matter-movement-not-part-of-ipl/article32907193.ece
247,2020/10/21,"IPL 2020 | Wake up call for us, we should take more responsibility: DC captain Shreyas Iyer","Against KXIP, Dhawan alone scored 106 while the quintet comprising Iyer, Prithvi Shaw, Marcus Stoinis, Rishabh Pant and Shimron Hetmyer contributed 54 runs collectively

It’s a wake up call, said Delhi Capitals skipper Shreyas Iyer as he urged his team’s batsmen, with the exception of an in-form Shikhar Dhawan, to take “more responsibility” following a surprise IPL loss to Kings XI Punjab here.

Delhi Capitals lost by five wickets after putting 164/5 on the board. Opener Dhawan continued to be in great form and his sequence of scores now read 69 not out, 57, 101 not out, and 106 not out, the last one coming in a losing cause.

“This is like a wake-up call for us. Going forward we are going to face tough situations and tougher teams. We have played amazing cricket in the past but we have to leave that in the past,” Iyer said at the post-match virtual press conference.

“We have to come out all guns blazing, play with freedom and take more responsibility. We need one match to qualify and keeping that in mind, we will take one match at a time,” he added.

Against KXIP, Dhawan alone scored 106 while the quintet comprising Iyer, Prithvi Shaw, Marcus Stoinis, Rishabh Pant and Shimron Hetmyer contributed 54 runs collectively.

“I am really happy for Shikhar Dhawan for the way he is going. He is creating an amazing platform for us as batsmen. We should be knowing our roles pretty well,” the DC skipper said.

However, he feels that his batsmen are in a good frame of mind and the defeat was a one off setback.

“Other than that, I feel all the batsmen are in really good frame of mind and few matches can go wrong here and there as fatigue creeps in. Keeping that aside we need to focus on our strengths,” he said.

Iyer didn’t blame the Dubai track as he felt that it played the same in both innings.

Asked about what Dhawan is doing that others aren’t able to do, Iyer spoke about clarity of mind and planning.

“The wicket played same in both innings. The way Shikhar is batting, his mindset has been amazing, it has been great throughout and he needs that quick start that keeps him going.

“The way he planned was amazing and we just need these sort of innings from him everyday. So, little bit of partnership in Powerplay from our openers (Prithvi Shaw) and we will get a big one.”

Iyer conceded that 26 runs off the fifth over bowled by Tushar Deshpande really changed the momentum in KXIP’s favour.

“The fifth over of the Powerplay definitely changed the momentum towards them but other than that we really played hard and took the game to the last run,” he said.

“We missed some run-outs and catches but that’s part and parcel of the game. We will do hardwork at our training in next few days.”

Deshpande, Iyer’s Mumbai Ranji Trophy teammate, was taken to cleaners by Chris Gayle, who hit him for three fours and two sixes in an over.

“Deshpande is a confident lad and does his homework pretty well. He has been hit by Chris Gayle, who is a world-class batsman and it’s a great learning experience for him.

“He will go back and analyse his mistakes and come back stronger.

248,2020/10/21,"Indian Premier League 2020 | One of our top four has to finish off games, we have to correct that, says Rahul","Kings XI Punjab have often struggled to finish games from comfortable positions in this IPL.

Kings XI Punjab skipper KL Rahul was relieved to see his team finally get over the line comfortably but said the top-four batsmen must consistently close out games in the remainder of their IPL campaign.

KXIP have often struggled to finish games from comfortable positions in this IPL.

For a change, it was a straightforward chase for KXIP against Delhi Capitals on Tuesday despite a rare failure from their opening pair of K L Rahul (15) and Mayank Agarwal (5).

Nicholas Pooran (53 off 28) came up with another blinder of a knock and Glenn Maxwell (32 off 24) finally found some form to set up their five-wicket win over Delhi Capitals.

“My heart keeps reaching new limits every game but yeah it is nice to finish it in the 19th over for once. I did wonder, I won’t lie, especially when you are playing with six batsmen and an all-rounder,” Rahul said at the post-match presentation.

“It is something every team talks about: the set batsman has to finish off the game. One of the top four does that. We have to correct that,” he added.

KXIP’s bowling unit pulled things back in the death overs to restrict DC to a below-par 164 for five.

Under-fire Glenn Maxwell played a crucial 24-ball 32 and took a wicket. Rahul said it was important to back the Australian.

“Glenn is a great team man. He has been batting well in the nets. It was important to back him. It was good to see him get time in the middle. Hopefully, he carries this good work into the coming games,” he said.

In their last match, KXIP had beaten Mumbai Indians via a second Super Over and Rahul said he “didn’t sleep a whole lot” after that game on Sunday night.

“Took a long time to sink in. Kept thinking all night how we could have closed it off before the Super Over. But it keeps us humble, the game is bigger than any of us.”

Shikhar Dhawan (106), who was awarded the Man of the Match for his historic back-to-back hundred, said he took the onus on himself to do bulk of the scoring after not getting support from the other end.

“I took the responsibility of holding one end up and was also hitting the boundaries when I got the chance. I really enjoyed it today. It is good that I am scoring consistently so you carry it into the next games,” he said.

“We are going to have a discussion and see where we can improve. We have been playing very good quite consistently. This is not going to put us down.”

Delhi Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer said his team was 10 runs short but vowed to come back stronger.

“I feel that we fell around 10 runs short, but we got a lot of learnings from this game. Tushar leaked runs but that happens to the best of us. I’m sure he will come back,” he said.

“The good thing is that the boys will be charged up for the next game. We weren’t up to the mark tonight, but I’m sure we will be next time.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/x20y3g/article32904358.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MAXWELL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-one-of-our-top-four-has-to-finish-off-games-we-have-to-correct-that-says-rahul/article32904359.ece
249,2020/10/21,Delhi HC allows Arvind Kejriwal’s plea for witness statement in ex-Chief Secretary assault case,"High Court issues directive to trial court

New Delhi

In a major boost to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and other AAP leaders in the former Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash alleged assault case, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed a trial court here to also consider the statement of a former advisor to the Chief Minister who was present at the 2018 meeting pertaining to the case.

Justice Suresh Kumar Kait directed the trial court here, which is seized of the case, to consider the statement of V.K. Jain at the time of passing the order.

The High Court’s order came with a stern message to the police that it was their duty “to do free and fair investigation by bringing to the notice of the court all the evidences collected during the investigation without picking and choosing the one which does not support them”.

“The accused has been provided with a definite right under the provisions of Cr.P.C. (Code of Criminal Procedure) and the constitutional mandate to face the charge against him by a fair investigation and trial,” the High Court said.

Also read: Proceed with hearing in Chief Secy assault case: HC

Mr. Kejriwal, in his plea, had alleged the prosecution of withholding the statement of witness Mr. Jain recorded on February 21, 2018, because it did not suit the prosecution case and helped in falsely implicating him, his Deputy Manish Sisodia and other AAP leaders including Prakash Jarwal and Amanatullah Khan.

Mr. Jain, in the 2018 statement, which was reproduced in the judgment, stated that on the night of February 19, there was a meeting that took place between the AAP leaders and Mr. Prakash on the issue of ‘Door Step Delivery of Ration’, ‘Advertisement Funds Release’ and slow processing of files.

Also read: Delhi Chief Secretary 'assault' case

During the meeting, Mr. Jain stated that he went to the washroom and upon returning saw former Chief Secretary Prakash leaving. Mr. Jain stated that he could not say anything about what transpired while he was in the washroom.

The trial court had in its order, which was contested by the AAP leaders, noted that since it was a record of oral examination of Mr. Jain by the Investigating Officer (IO) and was noted in the ‘Case Diary’, the said examination did not take the place of a statement made under Section 161 Cr.P.C (Examination of witnesses by police). It had declined to supply this “crucial document” to the AAP leaders.

Justice Kait, however, observed that if a situation arose wherein an accused sought documents which supported his case and do not support the prosecution and the IO ignored these documents and forwarded only those documents which favoured the prosecution, in such a scenario, it would be the duty of the IO to make such documents available to the accused.

“The investigating agency has no power to appreciate the evidence, it rests with the court,” Justice Kait remarked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/okgsar/article32907559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANSHUPRAKASHKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-hc-allows-arvind-kejriwals-plea-for-witness-statement-in-ex-chief-secretary-assault-case/article32907560.ece

After scoring 99% in CBSE results, Delhi government school students have set another benchmark with 53 students having qualified in JEE Advance and 569 students having qualified for NEET, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, these results have emerged as stories of hope, featuring students from humble backgrounds who fought all odds to qualify these exams with flying colours, he said.

“Over 569 students from schools run by the Delhi government qualified for NEET, Of these 569 students, 67%, which is approximately 379, are girls. I am extremely proud of the fact that girls have performed extremely well,” Mr. Kejriwal said at a digital briefing.

“At least 443 students from government schools cleared JEE Mains and 53 students have qualified for JEE Advanced and have secured a seat for themselves in IITs,” said the Chief Minister.

He also asked students seeking to pursue higher studies not to be concerned about financial resources if they had cleared Class 12 and lacked the means to move forward.

“The Delhi government has scholarships to offer and any student, rich or poor, can get a loan amount of up to ₹10 lakh without submitting any collateral from the government and can exercise their right to education,” he assured students.

252,2020/10/21,"Ban on genset leaves 1,000 families in the dark for 12 hours","This comes after EPCA ban on diesel generators; residents say no regular supply since 2016

Around a thousand families residing in Sector 37D’s Ramprastha City — a 450-acre township along Dwarka Expressway — were forced to go without power supply for nearly 12 hours on Tuesday after the developer turned off the diesel generator.

For the past four years, the residents of the township have depended upon the power supplied by the generator for 10-12 hours daily. As many as 22 residential societies in the Millennium City don’t have regular power connections and depend on supply from the diesel generators. However, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority has banned the use of generators, with some exceptions, from October 15 because of the spike in pollution levels.

Ramprastha City’s Atrium Condominium Welfare Association president Pradip Rahi said the developer refused to supply power through the generator without citing any reason. The power went off around 5 a.m., leaving the residents in the lurch. “Most residents are working from home and have important meetings scheduled. The children could not attend their online classes,” said Mr. Rahi.

Meanwhile, the developer did not respond to repeated calls and messages for a comment on the issue.

The residents met the Deputy Commissioner during the day saying they had paid all dues to the developer, including electricity connection charges, but the township did not have a regular connection since 2016. The power from the grid was supplied partially through a temporary connection. The residents demanded that the developer be held accountable for not completing the infrastructure.

The power was restored around 5 p.m. after an intervention by the Department of Town and Country Planning. The DHBVN superintending engineer Manoj Yadav said the power had gone due to a fault in the sub-station. He said the developer was told to submit an affidavit to the EPCA with the schedule to complete electricity infrastructure in the township.

On the rampant violation of the ban on diesel generators in the city, Regional Officer, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, Manesar, Shakti Singh said the officials could not be “omnipresent”.

Haryana Chief Secretary Vijai Vardhan told The Hindu that a letter would be submitted to the EPCA on Wednesday with the detailed plan to supply power through the grid in these areas and seek temporary exemption.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ban-on-genset-leaves-1000-families-in-the-dark-for-12-hours/article32904382.ece

A 35-year-old man was allegedly murdered by his brothers over a property dispute in outer north Delhi’s Samaypur Badli, thepolice said on Tuesday.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North) Gaurav Sharma said the accused — Vivek Jha and Satish Jha — have been arrested for killing Dileep.

Dileep was reported missing by his brothers on October 16. Two days after this, a body was found in a canal in Haiderpur in an open steel trunk. With the help of a label on his pant, the body was identified.

The brothers were then called for questioning after their conduct was found to be suspicious. Next, Dileep’s wife told the police that he had a dispute with his brothers over their residential property. The wife has been staying at her mother’s house for the last two months.

The brothers, during sustained questioning, told investigators that they strangulated the victim to death on October 15 after they had a quarrel with when he had come home drunk.

A senior officer said the matter was reported on October 15 by the victim’s mother. She told the police that she, her husband and their daughter sleep on the roof of toilets outside Old Delhi railway station. The accused and a few other boys also sleep at the same place.

256,2020/10/21,Gulfisha’s statutory bail plea rejected,"Court also rejects plea of two others charged under UAPA

A Delhi court has rejected statutory bail plea of student activist Gulfisha Khatoon, arrested under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA,) in a case related to the north-east Delhi riots.

Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat also rejected similar statutory bail applications made separately by Saleem Khan and Tasleem Ahmed, who also have been charged under the stringent UAPA in connection with the riots.

“There is no merit in the present application,” the judge said while dismissing the statutory bail pleas.

Ms. Khatoon, in her plea, stated that she was arrested on April 11, 2020, and has been in judicial custody for over 183 days. She contended that no chargesheet has been filed by the police and, therefore, she has the right to be released on bail upon the expiry of 90 days of custody.

Both Mr. Khan and Mr. Ahmed too stated they were arrested in June and were had been in judicial custody for over 110 days. The trio also contended that the ASJ court does not have jurisdiction over the present case.

The Special Prosecutor submitted that there is no merit in the present application as the ASJ court has been authorised by the Delhi High Court to deal with the present case.

258,2020/10/21,HCNG dispensing centre for buses inaugurated,"A hydrogen enriched-Compressed Natural Gas (HCNG) plant and dispensing station was inaugurated at the Rajghat Depot here on Tuesday.

The four-tonne/day compact reformer-based HCNG production plant has been set-up by the IOCL in collaboration with the Delhi Transport Department. The department has provided a fund of ₹15 crore for the setting up of the plant and conducting the study.

Over 50 cluster buses have been earmarked by the Transport Department for holding demonstration trials starting today for a period of six months. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has also notified HCNG as a fuel starting September, 2020.

Hydrogen enriched-Compressed Natural Gas or HCNG, is predicted to be the first step to a hydrogen economy, and can be used in place of gasoline, diesel fuel/LPG and its combustion produces fewer undesirable gases in comparison to a normal automobile fuel.

It reduces the emission of carbon dioxide by 70% and increases the fuel efficiency by upto 3% resulting in overall fuel savings of around 5%.

260,2020/10/21,Kalinga’s story,"Duryodhana takes the help of Kalinga to get rid of Dhritarashtra’s affection for the Pandavas, said V.S.Karunakarachariar in a discourse. Kalinga tells Dhritarashtra a story. In a forest there was a clever fox, who sought the help of a tiger, a rat, a wolf and a mongoose to kill a lion. The rat was to bite the lion when the latter was asleep. With the lion in pain, killing it would be easy for the tiger. All five friends would then feast on the lion’s flesh.

The fox’s plan worked, and the tiger killed the lion. The fox then told the other animals that they should bathe before eating the meat, while the fox stood guard over the dead lion.

The tiger was the first to return, and the fox said, “The rat was here and said, ‘If not for my biting the lion, would the tiger have been able to kill it? Does this tiger deserve to be treated with respect?’ The rat’s words about you upset me.” The tiger felt that it would be a disgrace to eat the lion, for the killing of which a mere rat took credit. So, the tiger left. The rat arrived next. The fox said,” The mongoose was here just now and said that your bite would have poisoned the meat. It also wanted to hurt you. How could I allow a friend to be hurt?” The frightened rat ran into its hole. To the wolf, the fox said: “The tiger wanted to kill you, because you apparently doubted his strength.” The wolf ran away. To the mongoose, the fox said, “I fought the tiger and wolf and they ran off in fear. Let us fight. If you win, you can have the meat.” The mongoose felt that he stood no chance, and went away.

Kalinga says that the moral of the story is that Dhritarashtra must give up his affection for the Pandavas, and resort to every means possible to safeguard the kingdom for his sons.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/kalingas-story/article32904151.ece

A trickster who duped a man to the tune of ₹ 1.7 crore in the guise of gold business was arrested by Hyderabad Central Crime Police.

In August last year, K. Koteswara Rao Gupth from Ameerpet lodged a complaint against Kota Rakesh from Guntur alleging that the latter promised to supply gold at a low price compared to the market, and took ₹ 1.7 crore and failed to supply the yellow metal.

Based on the complaint lodged by Mr. Rao, a case was registered and police swung into action and collected evidence. They establishedprima facie evidence against the accused and launched a manhunt to nab the accused. Rakesh was arrested in Tenali and brought to Hyderabad on prisoner transit warrant, said Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty.

The accused, Rakesh (46) alias Komaravelly Harishankar alias Jampana Suresh hails from Chikkaballapur district in Karnataka. He used to tempt innocent people on the pretext of supplying gold at a low price. “To gain the trust of his clients, he would supply small amounts of gold for a low price two or three times. Once the person trusts him, he will collect the huge amounts and escape,” Mr. Mohanty said.

Earlier Rakesh was involved in various offences in Vijayanagaram, Vijayawada in AP and Karimnagar and Nalgonda here. “He was absconding to avoid the arrests and trials.

262,2020/10/21,A mountain of trash by the riverside,"“This cannot be removed by sweeping with a broom,” say Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation’s sanitation workers as they await the big machines to clean the trash lining the road.

On the northern bank of River Musi before the Purana Pul, garbage covers the bent trees, sidewalks, electric supply lines, temples built inside the river and washing stands of the washermen. The garbage ranges from furniture, electrical wires, used tyres, plastic waste, clothes and building waste. Where there is no garbage, there is sludge and muck.

Environmental damage

Away from the human tragedy wrecked by the rain over the past 10 days is the environmental destruction which has not yet been calculated. “We stay up there. The waste has been dumped on the road which is lower than the colony’s level,” says Latha, a resident of Sanjeev Nagar, who washes clothes in the river.

“It is inevitable there will be an outbreak of diseases if the waste is not moved quickly and processed. The biological waste can get into the water system and lead to diseases,” says K. Sujata Rao, former Union Health Secretary when informed about the waste that has been dumped by the river.

Multiple sewage channels in the city dump unprocessed waste into the river. According to the Telangana State Pollution Control Board, there are 23 sewage treatment plants on the Musi. The pollution control body pegged the cost of construction and maintenance of additional sewage treatment plants required to process the water flowing in the river over a 10-year period at ₹15,884 crore. Currently, only 43% of water flowing into the river undergoes some form of waste treatment.

“Whatever garbage that has been dumped in the river and in its catchment area must have been washed ashore. The river is dry most of the time and the waste must have accumulated there. If it is processed at designated sites, there should be no problem,” says V. Srinivas Chary of Centre of Excellence in Urban Development at Administrative Staff College of India.

264,2020/10/21,‘Power supply restoration taken up on war footing’,"Supply still cut off to consumers under purview of 45 transformers

All power utilities, particularly the two Discoms, in the State are engaged in power supply restoration works on war , said chairman and managing director of TS-Transco and TS-Genco D. Prabhakar Rao. Power supply was either stopped as a precautionary measure or snapped with washing away/damage to transmission and distribution installations.

Mr. Rao reviewed the progress of restoration works here on Wednesday and stated heavy rain and floods had caused extensive damage to the T&D network such as distribution transformers, poles, high tension and low tension transmission lines across the State, particularly in GHMC/HMDA areas. The damage was on account of rain and floods during the last two weeks, Mr. Rao said, adding that power utilities had been striving hard to restore power supply to all the affected areas.

However, the work had become challenging, particularly in the twin cities as power installations in low-lying areas still remain inundated, posing safety threat in the event of restoration of supply.

Besides, water in the cellars of several apartments in such areas had also been a hurdle in restoring power supply, he explained.

In GHMC are 15 out of the 286 sub-stations were affected but all of them were restored. Besides, of the 2,927 11-KV feeders, 754 were affected and rectified and among the nearly 1.18 lakh distribution transformers, 1,170 out of 1,215 affected transformers were rectified and 45 were still waterlogged. The transformers to which power supply could not be restored so far include 20 in apartments and 25 in other residential areas.

Of 8,73 lakh electrical poles in GHMC, 1,296 were affected but 1,264 of those were repaired/ restored.

He stated that three nodal officers had been appointed to oversee the restoration works and people could contact on them regarding power supply related problems. The nodal officers were entrusted the duty of monitoring the rectification works across the State. The contact numbers of the nodal officers are: 94408-13856 (TSSPDCL areas), 94408-11210 (TSNPDCL areas) and 94913-98550 (TS-Transco).",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lglakj/article32912024.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21-POLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/power-supply-restoration-taken-up-on-war-footing/article32912019.ece
265,2020/10/21,Bandlaguda Jagir residents living on the edge,"Only an hour’s notice if Osmansagar gates are to be lifted

On Wednesday, a viral video from Bandlaguda Jagir left people alarmed. In that, an employee of Bandlaguda Jagir Municipal Corporation could be seen appealing to people living alongside Musi river to vacate their homes and head to safer places as there were chances of the gates of Gandipet (Osmansagar reservoir) to be lifted the same day.

As one drives by Gandhamguda in the Jagir, a row of houses in low-lying localities alongside the river can be seen for a fairly long distance. While some are adjoining the river, some are placed a little away from flowing water. The threat of getting inundated is real for people living on the edge, literally.

Dream Homes colony is right on the edge of the river. Some residents of the community kept constant check on the water level on Wednesday afternoon. While children were seen playing in the gated community, the elders started to pack their belongings and leave. “There was no flooding here when it rained heavily on October 13. We were asked to shift to a safer place and are now doing so,” said Kamal Kishore, one of the residents of the locality.

Some of his neighbours too were preparing to leave. Along with them, people living in 10 more colonies were asked to shift to a safer place at the earliest.

The Municipal Corporation’s Commissioner G. Venugopal Reddy and his team mapped the places alongside the Musi river which are vulnerable to flooding if gates of the Osman Sagar reservoir were to be lifted. The 11 places include Bandalguda Village, KK Phase II, Venkateswara Nagar, Kukkala Manyam, Fort View apartments, Sowbhagya Nagar, Sai Harsha Nagar, Vishal Nagar, Sairam Nagar, Dream Home community and Carry Home community.

The Full Reservoir Level (FRL) of the Osmansagar is 1790 feet. By Wednesday afternoon, the water level had touched 1786.787 feet.

“If it rains heavily on Wednesday midnight, the FRL will be reached and gates of the reservoir will be lifted. Low-lying areas might get inundated. If the gates were to be lifted, one-hour time will be given. As a cautionary measure, we have already asked people living in the 11 colonies to move to safer places. We shifted some people living in shanties to a government school,” Mr Venugopal said.

The municipality employees corroborate that there are definite chances of some homes to get impacted if it rains heavily again.

T. Laxman, a 50-plus man who has resided in Bandlaguda Jagir all his life, has witnessed Musi overflow at least thrice and even cycled through overflowing water. On Wednesday afternoon, he was seen at the banks of the river. “We used to catch fish from the river. Now there are homes in that spot. I did not see it overflow in the past 15 years. If the gates are released and the river overflows, these homes will see the impact,” Mr Laxman said, pointing at a few houses seen from the river bank.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2ax28y/article32912015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy21-Laxman,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bandlaguda-jagir-residents-living-on-the-edge/article32912002.ece

Intensifying the efforts to retain the top slot in the implementation of Ease Of Doing Business (EODB) parameters, the State government has decided to make online submission of applications mandatory in two more sectors. The development assumes significance as Telangana which was placed at the top along with the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh has been placed in the third position in the latest EODB ranking after Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The slippage of rank was said to be because of the feedback mechanism where the State lost a few points.

The Director of Agricultural Marketing had been made the designated authority with the entire State as his jurisdiction.

Online mechanism has been introduced as there would be no physical touch point for the activities including submission of application, payment of application fee and tracking and monitoring the application status. Users would be able to download the final digitally signed approved certificate online and the checklist of required documents for these services would be made available on the website.

Similarly, online submission of applications and issue of registration/renewal certificates would be mandatory through the website www.pcpndt.telangana.gov.

Applicable procedures, comprehensive list of documents, clear time lines and third party verification of services would be made on the website.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/eodb-parameters-extended-to-two-departments/article32911923.ece
267,2020/10/21,₹25 lakh ex gratia forthe affected sought,"Cong. Core Committee meet held

The Core Committee meeting of the Telangana Congress that met at Pragnapur has demanded that the State government increase the amount for flood relief from ₹500 crore to ₹5,000 crore and also condemned Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for not visiting the flood-affected areas in the city or the extensive crop damage areas in rural areas.

“A number of issues such as huge misery and loss of life, property and agricultural crops and the inadequate response of state and central governments were discussed. The Core Committee unanimously passed resolutions on various issues,"" Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy said. The meeting was attended by AICC Incharge Manickam Tagore, CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka and other senior leaders.

The meeting also decided to write to the Prime Minister that the present situation in Telangana be declared as a national calamity, a statement said.

Mr. Reddy demanded that the amount sanctioned by the State government for flood relief be increased from ₹500 crore to ₹5000 crore; ex gratia of ₹25 lakh be given to each person who has died and ₹5 lakh for the houses damaged fully apart from ₹2 lakh to partially damaged houses.

Mr. Reddy said the government must immediately take up enumeration of crop damage due to rains. ""For all farmers where extensive crop damage has occurred, an amount of ₹20,000 per acre be given immediately. Damaged cotton, paddy and maize be purchased with relaxed conditions and higher moisture content be accepted.

The party leaders argued in the meeting that the Chief Minister had directed the farmers to cultivate finer varieties of paddy and since the farmers are yielding 30% lesser and losing Rs.10,000 per acre the government should purchase paddy at Rs. 2,500 per quintal.

Pump house

The Congress party also condemned the negligent approach of the TRS government and blamed it to the collapse of the Kalwakurthy lift irrigation scheme in Mahabubnagar district. This has led to a loss of thousands of crores to the public exchequer and loss of irrigation water to 3.2 lakh acres of parched lands in Mahabubnagar district.

The Minister, who is also Secunderabad MP, said as per the revised norms decided by the NDA Government in 2015, ₹4 lakh each will be disbursed to the families of the deceased and ₹2 lakh for anyone disabled during the natural calamity.

The money will be released from the National Disaster Response Fund and the State Disaster Response Fund. A sum of ₹1207 will be given for the injured persons, ₹1800 for those who lost their clothes and other belongings and ₹2000 for household goods purchases.

“The Modi Government had revised the relief and rehabilitation norms five years ago and accordingly funds will be released. The State Government has already submitted a preliminary report and officials are looking into it. It will be assessed along with the report submitted by the Central team,” said Mr. Reddy.

The Minister advised the TS Government to make use of the State Disaster Relief Fund to provide succour to the affected people and the Centre will reimburse the same as it is meant to be used for these kinds of emergencies.

“The Centre is ready to provide any kind of assistance to the State Government This is not the time to do finger pointing and criticise as Central teams are being dispatched without even waiting for the rains to subside. Centre or State, the funds will be from the public exchequer so there is no need for politicking on this issue,” he said.

At the same time, Mr. Reddy took a swipe at the TRS Government charging that the encroachments on lakes and storm water drains continues unabated. “Satellite data will clearly show the extent of encroachments on all water bodies in the last few years. Illegal dumping of debris is continuing and I myself had brought these to the notice of collectors concerned many a time,” he said.

The Minister also claimed the desilting of storm water drains is not being done efficiently. “Nothing much has changed to prevent urban flooding despite the change of Governments over the years,” he maintained.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ttel1c/article32908744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYDERABADRAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/5-member-central-team-to-visit-hyderabad-to-assess-losses-due-to-rains/article32908745.ece
273,2020/10/21,185 tanks overflowing around Hyderabad due to heavy rains,"Telangana Principal Irrigation Secretary Rajat Kumar has said that all the 185 tanks in Hyderabad have surplussed and overflowing following heavy rains over the past week.

On the directions of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao a few hours earlier, Mr. Rajat Kumar held a meeting with irrigation officials and constituted fifteen teams to monitor the situation at tanks round the clock and inform higher officials. By special powers, the Zonal Commissioners of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation were authorised to sanction works up to ₹2 crore for immediate powers. Earlier, they could sanction works not exceeding ₹20 lakh.

Speaking to reporters along with Engineer-in-Chief of Irrigation C. Muralidhar, he said except three tanks — Pallechuruvu at Rajendranagar, Appacheruvu at Gaganpahad and Gurram Cheruvu at Balapur — which suffered major damages, none of the remaining 182 tanks breached. The repairs to three tanks were carried out within twelve hours. There were minor damages to fifty three tanks.

The unprecedented rains resulted in 60 to 70 cms of rainfall within a week from October 14 while the average annual rainfall of the city was 80 cms. The chief amounts of rainfall were recorded on October 14 (32 cms). October 17 (10 cms) and October 18 (19 cms).

Reassuring citizens that the situation was not out of hands, the senior bureaucrat said fifty per cent of dewatering was already completed. . He admitted to problems of inundation in low lying areas where people were evacuated with boats of tourism department.

He did not spell out the number of deaths nor encroachments of tanks as the police looked into casualties while encroachments were a subject matter of courts and sub judice to discuss. However, he said all the tanks in the State were mutated to irrigation department.

Overall, he said 101 tanks out of 46,000 tanks in the State breached. Permission to strengthen the bunds of tanks was given. Irrigation officials were instructed to reduce the weir of tanks and release water to avoid breaches.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/8s20yv/article32911747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/185-tanks-overflowing-around-hyderabad-due-to-heavy-rains/article32907958.ece
274,2020/10/21,Disbursal of aid to rain-hit begins,"Minister K. T. Rama Rao takes lead by visiting affected areas

The State government has started disbursal of financial assistance of ₹10,000 to poor families that faced the brunt of the recent deluge losing valuables as well as essentials that are stored in their houses.

Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao said that three to four lakh people affected by the unprecedented floods would be extended financial assistance of ₹10,000 each.

With Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao announcing his government’s resolve to provide succour to affected families in Greater Hyderabad and certain other districts in the form of financial assistance as immediate relief, the government commenced distribution of the financial assistance in less than 24 hours of the announcement. Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao took the lead in the process visiting several affected areas throughout the day and interacting with residents in the affected areas braving the intermittent showers that lashed parts of the city.

He enquired with the officials about the extent of the damage and the amounts that would be needed for providing permanent solutions to check the problems like water logging and inundation on account of heavy rains. He also sought information about the measures that should be taken to avoid occurrence of flood-like situations in future in spite heavy rainfall.

Officials of the State administration as well as Ministers and MLAs fanned out into the affected areas to instil confidence among the affected families and distributed the assistance as announced by the Chief Minister. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar personally tracked the distribution process throughout the day and ensured that all the eligible beneficiaries were given the assistance.

Mr. Rama Rao conducted whirlwind visits to the affected areas and enquired with the residents about the losses they incurred as well as the problems they were facing in the aftermath of the deluge. He assured that the government was committed to coming to their rescue and take steps to ensure that normalcy returned in these areas at the earliest.

Mr. Rama Rao, accompanied by Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav and MLA Danam Nagender visited the MS Maktha in front of Raj Bhavan and distributed ₹10,000 each to affected families. He visited the Shaikpet area, one of the worst affected in the State capital, and enquired with the residents about the problems they were facing. The Minister made it a point to visit Nadeem Colony which continued to witness water-logging and affected areas in Nagole and distributed the assistance besides instilling confidence among the residents that the government would stand by them. He also asked all the public representatives to spend their time for the next one week in the rain affected areas and handover the financial assistance.

MP Asad Uddin Owaisi, MLAs Danam Nagender, Sudheer Reddy, Mayor Bonthu Rammohan, and local GHMC corporators accompanied the Minister.

Review meet

Earlier in the day, the Minister held a review meeting with the city MLAs and MLCs at Pragathi Bhavan.

He asked all the public representatives to stay on the ground for the coming ten days and assist the people.

He instructed them to ensure toilets are set up apart from availability of medicines, blankets, and food.

The Minister also appealed to the residential welfare associations and NGOs to come together and support the government in providing relief measures to the citizens.

He assured that the government will come up with permanent solutions to avoid flood-like situations in the city.

On the call given by the Chief Minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao the city-based MLAs and MLCs decided to donate their two-month salaries to Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. Mr. KTR appreciated them for their decision.

275,2020/10/21,‘EC to Kaleshwaram in violation of law’,"National Green Tribunal directs Centre to appoint expert panel on remedial measures

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has held that environmental clearance (EC) to Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project (KLIP) was granted ex post facto, after completion of substantial work, by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) “in violation of law”.

It has also observed that accountability needs to be fixed and remedial measures taken. For that purpose, it has directed the MoEF&CC to constitute a seven-member expert committee preferably out of expert appraisal committee (EAC) members with relevant sectorial expertise to go into the matter in light of the observations in the present case.

In the judgment posted on its website on Tuesday in a petition filed by one Md. Hayath Udin, a resident of Siddipet district, who is also a farmer affected directly by the project, the Principal Bench of NGT asked the Ministry to constitute the expert committee within a month and it may complete its exercise within six months thereafter shouldering the responsibility of monitoring the panel work to the Secretary of MOEF&CC.

The petitioner moved the NGT with a plea to declare the EC granted to KLIP as invalid since substantial work was done by the State government, project proponent, prior to filing application with the Ministry for clearance.

“We find that in spite of finding illegality in granting EC, it is neither possible nor desirable to undo what has happened, but accountability needs to be fixed and remedial measures taken”, the Bench comprising Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, Judicial Member Justice S.P. Wangdi and Expert Member Dr. Nagin Nanda said in their judgment.

The NGT principal bench suggested that the expert committee could assess the extent of damage caused in going ahead with the project without EC – the period from 2008 to 2017 -- and identify the necessary restoration measures. Further, it could look into relief and rehabilitation measures adopted and required to be further adopted, examine effective implementation of environmental management plan (EMP) submitted by the project proponent as also compliance of EC conditions.

“Any affected party will be at liberty to make representation to the MoEF&CC within three weeks along with suggestions and grievances, which may be taken into account by the expert committee”, the NGT said in its judgment. It has further asked MoEF&CC to consider measures to prevent recurrence of such violations where EC is sought ex post facto.

It is particularly required when the projects are multi-purpose and part of it requires EC, so that such requirement is not defeated on specious plea that the project was partly not covered by the schedule Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) notification as has happened in the present case, the NGT observed. Instead of confining consideration merely to documentary support, a mechanism is required to be evolved and followed whereby physical verification of material particulars can be undertaken, wherever necessary, it suggested.

In the matter of expansion of the project scope to draw 3 tmc ft of water a day from the present 2 tmc ft, the NGT observed that directions of the Centre are binding on the State unless challenged and set aside.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/yj97ks/article32904284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20KRAKALESHWARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ec-to-kaleshwaram-in-violation-of-law/article32904285.ece
276,2020/10/21,‘NGT verdict unlikely to have impact on first-phase Kaleshwaram works’,"Enhanced capacity works, for lifting third tmcft of water, to be affected, say senior engineers

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) judgment on the execution of Kaleshwaram Lift irrigation Project (KLIP) given on Tuesday is not likely to have any impact on the ongoing works pertaining to the project, for which environmental clearance (EC) has been secured already – for lifting of 2 tmcft water a day and water conveyance network.

However, it is likely to impact the works on lifting the third tmcft of water, which were taken up earlier this year, senior engineers of the irrigation department felt following the green tribunal’s verdict on a petition challenging the EC given even to works being executed to lift and convey 2 tmcft of water a day. The NGT has pointed out that clearance for the enhanced capacity of works was not taken and directed the State government to follow the Centre’s directions on it.

“Notwithstanding the time frame, all clearances to the Kaleshwaram project have been secured following due processes and there has been no violation in those processes including impact assessment, holding public hearing, environmental management, payment of compensation and relief and rehabilitation works,” a senior engineer involved in the execution of the project from the beginning said, unwilling to go on record/to be quoted.

He was of the opinion that even the expert committee recommended by the NGT to be constituted by the Environment Ministry could find the scale of relief and rehabilitation works for the people displaced by the project on the ground, irrespective of allegations by some sections that they were not in the scale expected by the affected people.

When contacted, Principal Secretary (Irrigation) Rajat Kumar told The Hindu that they (the State government) “will abide by the NGT judgement completely in the matter of executing Kaleshwaram project, particularly in case of enhanced capacity works”.

According to the irrigation department engineers executing the KLIP, the enhanced capacity of lifting and conveying third tmcft of water would have a network of one balancing reservoir, two pump houses, over 19 km length of pipeline network with 3.6 metre to 4 metre diameter pipes comprising 8 to 10 rows and nearly 14.3 km length of approach and gravity canal.

“Only the approach and gravity canals of the enhanced capacity of the project would require land acquisition and the pipelines would be laid underground without impacting the land use even for cultivation. Head works of the enhanced capacity already have the provision for installation of additional motor-pump sets to lift back water from Medigdda-Annaram-Sundilla Barrages into Yellampally Barrage without requiring any land acquisition or additional power transmission network,” the senior engineer explained.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ngt-verdict-unlikely-to-have-impact-on-first-phase-kaleshwaram-works/article32904163.ece
277,2020/10/21,A deluge of claims awaiting insurance companies,"General insurance companies are estimating around ₹500 cr. property damage claims

From damaging automobiles, flooding properties to ripping portions of roads, the havoc wreaked by torrential rain in Hyderabad and its suburbs is set to flood general insurance companies with claims in the days ahead.

They have begun in the form of motor claims, said sources in insurance industry, estimating property damage claims arising from the downpour to be around ₹500 crore.

In case of a flood-like scenario, two lines of business that get impacted are motor and property insurance. Stating this, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Chief Technical Officer T.A. Ramalingam said the number of motor claims are bound to be relatively high and have started coming. “We expect a couple of more days’ time before we get the full impact of the number of claims [as some areas are still waterlogged],” he said.

The cost of repairs of automobiles, especially new generation vehicles equipped with electronics, is likely to be an expensive affair. While that is an issue for vehicle owners and how much own damage insurance have they opted, for the automobile service sector the challenge is to handle the increase in the number of vehicles. At the over 50 authorised Maruti Suzuki service centres, the emphasis is on expediting the turnaround, according to a senior executive of the company’s service division.

Severely damaged cars, however, require more time to be brought back to running condition, especially those that remained under water for more than 24 hours. Besides authorised centres, a number of private multi-brand garages also are witnessing increase in the number of vehicles coming for repairs following the rain. Bal Reddy of S.K. Motors Bosch Car Service in ECIL said his workshop is receiving 3-4 rain rain impacted cars every day. According to him, workshops in some areas remain shut because of water logging.

Most of the cars damaged are those parked on the road, he says, adding there also are likely to be cases where the cost of repairs will be more than the resale value. Not all service centres are willing to undertake repairs on such cars as it is a time-consuming process, sometimes requiring a couple of months.

Senior surveyor P. Sowjanya Kumar said the insurance industry is estimating ₹500 crore of property damage in the rain. “Usually the reported claims are high, but the net will be less as the insured’s psychology is to report everything as damaged,” he said.

Noting that many claims were being reported, he said roads also form part of insurance and are covered, by the road contractors, under operational policy.

A clear picture on claims will take sometime. Reliance General Insurance ED and CEO Rakesh Jain said, “We have received 150 motor insurance claims and 21 commercial claim intimations. It is too early to determine the actual count and quantum of claims, as claims related to MSMEs start flowing 10 days after occurrence of the event. Going by the magnitude of the flood and property impacted, the actual claim numbers are expected to be high and we will be able to assess the situation fully only once the flood water recedes.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/5xosfh/article32904109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20HEAVYRAINS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/a-deluge-of-claims-awaiting-insurance-companies/article32904110.ece
278,2020/10/21,Indian Memory Project: Time travel through the history of a nation,"During this pandemic, when old albums are being dusted off to rediscover the people in them, the Indian Memory Project, a visual-narrative online archive turns 10. Curator Anusha Yadav on how these sepia-tone pictures are tiny integers in the story of the subcontinent

The courage and robust optimism of Jemishi Mehta’s Gujarati ancestors is bookended by two photographs — the first and the oldest family photograph they possess was taken in 1952, 37 years after Govind Ji Rewa Shankar Mehta, Jemishi’s great grandfather, moved from Jamnagar to Madras in 1915; the second, was taken in 2019.

Over the course of a 100 years, the Mehtas survived the upheavals of two World Wars, Partition, the rise and fall of businesses and the death of a son, whose image in the weathered photograph seems to have been obliterated by the passage of time, as much as he has been from the memory of those who knew him.

This poignant story was a recent addition to the 300 visual narratives featured in the Indian Memory Project (IMP), an online repository of stories from across the subcontinent. Built on memory and personal archives, the project holds a mirror to where we come from and where we are going as a nation.

Anusha Yadav, who helms IMP, established in 2010, was raised in the US, UK and India. A graduate of the National Institute of Design, this portrait photographer and brand culture design consultant’s interest in creating a human tapestry of our times began when she was a child. Her father passed away when she was 12 leaving behind boxes of photographs and Anusha engaged with his memory through them.

“For me any photograph then had to have a story,” says Anusha over a phone call from Mumbai. “I collected ads from India Today and Illustrated Weekly for my scrapbook. Jaipur, my hometown had families display photographs in the living room and I asked about the people in them. You never realise when the idea sows its seed. The interest in photography became sharper when NID and advertising happened. The visual offers valuable information about the subcontinent’s people, visitors, cultures, choices, circumstances and, thereby, consequences.”

The world over, many have used the lockdown to dust out family albums and catalogue pictures, but Anusha continues to receive the same number of entries for the project per month — two or three. However, she finds there is a growing interest in history design services such as family trees and biography books. IMP is supported by patrons whose funding has kept the portal advertisement-free.

One life, many stories

A one-woman show, Anusha curates while a floating population of volunteers and researchers unearth stories that have gathered the patina of memories even among the same family.

“When you don’t park your monetary hopes on something, you can keep chiselling at it. Some of the stories have helped families trace four-five generations across the world. It’s encouraging to know it is helpful and used for academic research,” says Anusha, underlining how IMP offers western audiences an eye-opener to an India they never knew. Part of the coursework at renowned educational institutions such as Ashoka University, Columbia University, and Yale, Anusha adds, “It changes notions of what India is to the West, that it is not Eat, Pray, Love, that it has one million personalities.”

Contributors, whether from India or abroad, are encouraged to send photographs and documents from before 1992 that have a link to the subcontinent. The documents should be owned and the sender should be able to identify those in a photograph. An accompanying text should also be submitted. It is after these criteria are met that Anusha and her team swing into action.

“Pictures are sacred; they are colour-corrected for brightness and contrast, nothing more. Aesthetics trump in studio set-up pictures. Families choose to not tell you something or choose to reveal something at a certain time; the text is proofed and edited. Most events mentioned, like war, migration, plague... have been documented and, therefore, can be fact-checked. Very personal facts are stated as ‘we were told’. If there is a discrepancy, we vet and articulate a grey area.”

Anusha adds that “Some of the text may need translation. Sometimes, pictures are sent on a whim and the sender may not recommit to investigating facts we may ask for; after much to and fro, there is no response. But quantity is not the issue. It’s not a magazine, it’s an archive. I don’t feel the need to bombard you with stories. I let it simmer.”

The tidal shifts that engulfed the subcontinent have resulted in 300 stories, each one a gem, unveiling a smorgasbord of personalities and experiences slotted under headers such as Delhi, Couple, 1920, Headgear, Muslim, ‘Mustache’, World War II and Studio Portraits.

Anusha’s favourite is the story of the devadasi who became the maharani of Dewas. “The photograph tells an incredible story of women who reclaimed their identity. Sometimes one story may lead to another more interesting footnote. Like the one on Sukhsampat Rai Bhandari who compiled the first English to Hindi and Marathi dictionaries. It was while researching on him that his involvement in the abdication of Tukojirao Holkar III of Indore after the famous Malabar Hill murder showed up.”

Remembrance of things past

Other remarkable stories come from Colonial India when young Indians keen to experience the wider world travelled abroad, like Manjerikandy Ramchandran who left Kerala at 16 and found fame as a wrestler in Africa; Lieutenant Laxman Kadle who worked in lonely outposts in Bengal, died and whose body was never found; the Sanghvis of the Wilson Pen Family who designed the pen that was used to write the seminal Constitution of India or the teenage Chameli Jain who participated in the freedom struggle, grew to be the matriarch of a family that has remained in the public eye and after whom is named an eponymous award for women mediapersons.

The writing brings alive old world nostalgia, places and institutions that have frayed around the edges; an escape into a time of wingback chairs, potted palms and Delhi University’s first ever girl rock band, Mad Hatter, kitted out in a sari and salwar kameez.

The IMP will never occupy a physical space says Anusha except for the museum store and the occasional pop-up. Its focus continues to underline that memorialisation must be an active practice and not a sporadic indulgence in nostalgia. And that through these visual stories, etched like images on a Grecian urn, we reclaim an almost lost Indian epic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/yburh7/article32908169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21MPOldPhotos-6,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/indian-memory-project-time-travel-through-the-history-of-a-nation/article32908170.ece
279,2020/10/21,Meet the family that gives shape to Chennai’s Durga idols,"Despite multiple challenges, idol maker Kishori Mohan Pal and his sons are in Chennai in time for Durga Puja, continuing a tradition that began 38 years ago

While most Bengalis flock to Kolkata for Durga Pujo, here is a family that unfailingly chooses Chennai over the City of Joy. Every year, idol maker Kishori Mohan Pal of West Bengal, and his team, who have been visiting the city since 1982, camp at Thakkar Bapa Vidyalaya in T Nagar where they create idols of Durga from scratch.

Kishori’s works are a regular fixture at the many Bengali associations in Chennai, Puducherry and Sriperumbudur on the city’s outskirts. The pandemic outbreak, however, threw his plans into uncertainty. “We usually reach Chennai three months before pujo. This time, we only got here in August,” says Kishori. A team of seven is now working long hours to complete the work at hand.

They received a call from the Kali Baari in T Nagar, and the following week were on a flight to Chennai. “Everything worked out to be much more expensive,” says Deben Pal, eldest of Kishori’s three sons, who has been accompanying his father since 1998. “We normally take the train. This time we had to book flight tickets online, something we attempted for the first time,” he adds.

Even transporting the raw materials took longer and cost more. “We bring everything from Bengal. The mud with which we create the figurines is from the Ganges,” he adds. Due to lockdown, Deben remarks that they could not scour for raw materials, and had to make do with what was readily available.

The demand for idols is also low this time, which also reflects in the size of the idols: five feet, compared to last year’s 10 feet height. “Last year, we received orders for 30 idols of Ma Durga along with her family: Lakshmi, Saraswathi, Ganesh and Karthik. This year, it is only 17. A lot of places are not celebrating. The ones who are celebrating are doing it on a small scale,” says Deben. The price of the idols start at ₹ 25,000.

With small budgets but large expenses, not to forget the time spent away from their families, has this trip been worthwhile for the Pals? “We would anyway have been sitting at home. It doesn’t matter if we incurred a loss. What is important is we could make these idols so people can celebrate this festival and pray,” says Deben, and expresses hope: “Asche bochor abar hobe (again, next year).”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/y31hg1/article32908070.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DURGAPUJO3,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/the-idol-makers-are-back/article32908071.ece
280,2020/10/21,SOP issued for management of COVID-19 victims’ bodies,"Department of LSG’s guidelines are based on Health Ministry protocol

The Department of Local Self Government has published the standard operating procedure for proper management of the bodies of COVID-19 victims.

The guidelines were issued following the confusion among the local bodies concerned and the relatives of the dead over the performance of the last rites. The standard operating procedure has been formulated based on the guidelines prescribed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on the management of the bodies of the victims and the precautions to be followed by the relatives and the municipal workers handling the bodies.

The local bodies will have to ensure safe handling, transportation and cremation of the body, if the relatives are not willing to receive the body. The ambulance used for shifting the body should be cleaned with one per cent sodium hypochlorite under the supervision of the health staff.

The family members can view the body after it has been prepared for burial in accordance with their customs and traditions. The body should not be taken out for bathing/viewing or placing in a mobile freezer. Those involved in placing the body in the grave or on the funeral pyre should wear PPE kits as per the health protocol.

The post-funeral ceremonies should be postponed as much as possible until the end of the pandemic. It is not compulsory that the belongings of the dead must be burnt or disposed of. However, it should be handled with gloves and cleaned with a detergent followed by disinfection with a solution of at least 70% ethanol or 0.1% (1000 ppm) bleach. The clothing and other fabric belonging to the victims should be machine washed with warm water at 60-90 degree Celsius and laundry detergent.

The hospital authorities should intimate the municipal authorities through the station house officer concerned on the last rites of the dead, if family members or relatives fail to get in touch with them or remain reluctant to receive the body within 12 hours after the death of the patient. The local bodies have to make all arrangements to cremate/bury the bodies as per the protocols in such cases, the guidelines said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/3ykxdm/article30780969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NCOV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/sop-issued-for-management-of-covid-19-victims-bodies/article32911496.ece

Haris, who died of COVID-19 in July, was named in an audio clip sent out by the nursing officer at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kalamassery. The officer had suggested in the clip that Haris had died because the staff had failed to place his ventilator tube properly. Meanwhile, a junior doctor, Dr. Najma Salim, who told a section of the media on Tuesday that the issues raised in the audio clip were likely to be true, has filed a complaint with the Kalamassery police. A few social media handles had wrongly alleged that she was part of the Kerala Students’ Union, and had portrayed her in poor light, she wrote in her complaint. She was also afraid of an attack against her on the basis of such posts on social media, she wrote.

Dr. Najma Salim said that she had previously alerted her superiors verbally to the fact that ventilator tubes and oxygen masks were sometimes not placed properly.

Questions around the deaths of three patients have been raised so far and she had known all three patients though she was not around when they died, she said.

In Haris’s case, a doctor on duty then had told her about the circumstances of his death, she said. “In the case of the two other patients, there were lapses, but I did not say that the negligence led to their deaths. They died a while after such lapses were noticed,” she said. Despite repeating that she was not part of a political party, allegations continued to do the rounds on social media prompting a police complaint, she said.

The police said that the complaint had been forwarded to the cyber cell for further action.

Nisthar K.A., who has filed a complaint alleging negligence in the death of his brother, Byhakki, who died of COVID-19 in July said, “The junior doctor’s statements made us question the circumstances around his death and we decided to proceed with filing a complaint,” he said. C.K. Sainabi, Haris’s sister, said that the family had been told that his condition was getting better a week after he was admitted. He was not in a critical condition when he was admitted to the hospital. The news of his sudden death had come as a shock and they were not told that he had died of a cardiac arrest, she said. While the family had complained to the hospital Superintendent soon after his death, they had received no response. Haris had not complained to them of any lack of medical attention, but negligence towards the end might have cost him his life, she said.

Rights panel order

The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has directed the Secretary of the Health Department and the Principal of the Government Medical College Hospital to conduct an inquiry and submit a report on the allegations that there were lapses in the treatment of COVID-19 patients at the hospital.

SHRC Chairman Antony Dominic has asked for the reports to be filed in three weeks. In its directive, the commission pointed out that the allegations were serious and that the audio clip had been brought to its notice.

‘Image tarnished’

The allegations had tarnished the reputation of the medical college and damaged the morale of the health workers at the institution, said a statement issued by the Ernakulam unit of the Kerala Government Medical College Teachers’ Association (KGMCTA). The hospital has been working relentlessly to fight the pandemic over the past nine months. While the KGMCTA supported an inquiry into the matter, the public and media organisations must refrain from engaging with the reactions that would damage the image of the hospital, their statement said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/brother-of-covid-19-victim-files-medical-negligence-complaint/article32911419.ece

285,2020/10/21,Livelihood innovation plan for migrant workers being explored,"Project part of ‘Let’s Reach Out Kerala’ initiative

Efforts are on to draw up a livelihood innovation plan for migrants in the second phase of the ‘Let’s Reach Out Kerala’ initiative, which was launched in the district a fortnight ago.

The project is being run by Atithi Devo Bhava, a migrant welfare project under the Ernakulam unit of the National Health Mission (NHM) in association with the Centre for Livelihoods and Social Innovation of School of Social Work, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai.

In the first phase during the lockdown, the initiative had reached out to nearly 15,000 stranded migrants across the State using a network of 200 volunteers.

“Our students will attempt to come up with such a plan based on their interactions with multiple stakeholders, including migrants, employers and State officials. For them, it is a fieldwork training offering them a hands-on learning platform on how issues related to migrant workers are being dealt with while also giving them an opportunity to actively contribute towards a more inclusive and equitable system, said Devisha Sasidevan, Assistant Professor, TISS, Mumbai.

Students are likely to suggest ideas and changes if something is not working, and help identify strong points of migrant workers, enhancing the effectiveness of official interventions.

Healthcare and livelihood assessment of migrant workers remain the priorities of the second phase of the initiative.

Call centre

Six students of social work from TISS, Mumbai, are in the city, while one student is working remotely, for associating with the project as part of their larger academic field work.

They were key in setting up a call centre as part of the Atithi Devo Bhava project’s initiative of linking NGOs in the district such as Kismat offering support to migrant workers returning to the State.

The centre addresses doubts of migrant workers and contractors on various formalities to be complied with on returning to Kerala like registering with the Atithi portal, and ensuring quarantine space.

The students being engaged are proficient in Hindi, Assamese, Marathi, Bengali, Bihari and Bhojpuri, enabling them to converse with migrants in their regional languages.

“Efforts are on to scale up the number of volunteers and even draw up a list of frequently asked questions,” said Dr. Akhil Xavier Manuel, nodal officer of Atithi Devo Bhava project.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/livelihood-innovation-plan-for-migrant-workers-being-explored/article32904682.ece
286,2020/10/21,PCB asks Kochi Corporation to pay up ₹13.95-crore penalty,"Notice issued to civic body as follow-up of NGT directive

The State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) has asked the Kochi Corporation to show cause within 15 days as to why it shall not recover an environmental compensation of ₹13.95 crore for its failure to comply with the norms under the Solid Waste Management Rules (SWM), 2016.

The notice was issued by the board chairman to the secretary of the civic body on October 15.

The amount was fixed for a period starting from November 22, 2018, to September 30 this year. The notice was issued as a follow-up of the steps being taken on the basis of a directive by the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal on a case related to non-compliance with SWM Rules, 2016 at the Brahmapuram solid waste processing plant, resulting in environmental pollution and posing a threat to public health.

The tribunal had stated that the Pollution Control Board could independently proceed against local bodies that were not complying with rules and assess the damage caused to the environment owing to such a lapse. The board had also used its powers prescribed under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986, while fixing the environment compensation based on ‘polluter pays principle’.

Waste generation

The assessment of environment compensation was done as per the population and class of the civic body. Kochi Corporation’s population was estimated at 6.77 lakh as per the 2011 Census data and it was included as a Class 1 local body. The daily waste generation was pegged at 315.96 tonnes. The waste disposed as per the rules was only 31.6 tonnes per days. The waste management capacity gap was estimated at 284.36 tonnes per day.

A meeting convened by the Chief Secretary in Thiruvananthapuram on September 22 had proposed that the compensation might be assessed for non-compliance from April this year onwards based on the population in each local body and as suggested in the tribunal’s order on July 3. The corporation would have had to pay a total of ₹25 lakh only as compensation from April 1 to September 30 based on this formula.

The board later decided to stick to the assessment procedure prescribed for the Central Pollution Control Board for cities included under the Class 1 category based on population. The notice also said that the corporation had not obtained authorisation under the SWM Rules, 2016.

Decision pending on municipalities

A decision on issuing notices for recovery of environment compensation from five municipalities dumping their biodegradable waste in Brahmapuram has been put on hold temporarily for want of clarity on the compensation regime.

Besides the Kochi Corporation, the Pollution Control Board had assessed the environment compensation for five municipalities including Aluva, Angamaly, Thrikkakara, Kalamassery, and Thripunitura for non-compliance of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The compensation estimated was ₹2.77 crore for Kalamassery, ₹1.72 crore for Aluva, ₹1.96 crore for Angamaly, ₹2.92 crore for Thrikkakara, and ₹2.72 crore for Thripunithura as on July 31, 2020.

Clarification sought

Senior board officials said that they had sought clarification from the Central Pollution Control Board on the formula to be followed for fixing the environment compensation on local bodies having population below one lakh. The five municipalities did not figure in the Class 1 category like the Kochi Corporation in terms of their population. A decision on whether notices should be issued to these five local bodies would be taken on the feedback of the Central board, they said.

The secretaries of the five municipalities had a recent online meeting with senior board officials on the action taken to manage the solid waste generated under their jurisdiction based on SWM Rules, 2016. Officials of the civic bodies claimed that they had internal systems in place to handle non-biodegradable waste. However, they admitted that biodegradable waste was still being transported to the dump yard in Brahmapuram.

As per the compensation scale proposed by the National Green Tribunal for non-compliance from April 1 this year, the local body having a population above 10 lakh would have to pay a compensation of ₹10 lakh a month while the corresponding figure for civic bodies having population between 5 lakh and 10 lakh will be ₹5 lakh per month. The tribunal had stated that the compensation would be ₹1 lakh a month for other local bodies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pcb-asks-kochi-corporation-to-pay-up-1395-crore-penalty/article32904649.ece

288,2020/10/21,Few takers for rainwater harvesting project,"Most households not willing to pay beneficiary contribution, says official

A rainwater harvesting project being implemented by the Kochi Corporation under the Union government’s Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) saw few takers among city residents, and has turned to government buildings to achieve its targeted fund utilisation. Around ₹1 crore had been set aside under the AMRUT project to set up rainwater harvesting systems in about 513 houses in the city. But only a little over 100 applications were received for the project and of them, only ten households were willing to pay the beneficiary contribution of ₹2,750, an official associated with the project said.

The implementing team was now in the process of identifying other buildings, mostly schools and anganwadis, to set up the rainwater harvesting system, they said. A rooftop system that would collect rainwater and transfer it to a tank for immediate use after filtering would be set up.

The Government Girls School in the Ernakulam South area was being considered as a possible site. Government offices might not be a feasible option, considering that some of the buildings were taken on rent, the official said. Of the ten beneficiaries who were willing to pay their contribution, work had begun in a few houses. The lukewarm response to the scheme was difficult to explain, since the project does not require the availability of much space, the official said.

All AMRUT projects are to be completed by March next year. Since there was little work to be done on the site itself, the team would be able to meet its target by next year, the official added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/few-takers-for-rainwater-harvesting-project/article32904616.ece
289,2020/10/21,New authentication system for LPG supply from Nov. 1,"Consumer will have to share OTP with the delivery boy to confirm receipt of cylinder

The public sector oil marketing companies, Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, will introduce a digital method for confirming receipt of LPG cylinders by customers from November 1 in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram.

The delivery authentication code will be a one-time password (OTP) sent to customers.

The consumer will have to share the OTP with the delivery boy to confirm receipt, said a communication from the IOC here on Tuesday.

The communication said that LPG being an essential commodity, was subsidized to a large extent and it was important to account for each LPG cylinder sold to registered customers of the oil companies.

The sharing of the OTP to confirm receipt of the cylinder will replace the traditional method of confirming receipt, which was for the customer to sign the distributor’s copy of the cash memo.

The delivery boy then made an entry in the domestic gas consumer card or the ‘Blue Book’ issued to the customers.

From June 2020, oil companies had introduced the digital method for taking confirmation of the receipt of LPG cylinders by customers.

Whenever a cash memo is generated by the distributor in the name of a customer, a four-digit code goes to the customer through an SMS to the registered mobile number.

The communication said that the digital method of taking confirmation of receipt was a safe and more sure method as it was a contactless and could be done by maintaining a distance of six feet between the customers and the delivery boy.

The new digital system was going to be made mandatory in all the 100 smart cities across the country from November 1, including in Kochi and the State capital, the communication said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/new-authentication-system-for-lpg-supply-from-nov-1/article32904547.ece

291,2020/10/21,"Medical college denies lapse, sees plot to defame institution","Junior doctor says audio clip suggesting staff negligence likely to be true

Doctors at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kalamassery, reiterated on Tuesday that there had been no lapse in the treatment given to COVID-19 patients at their facility, which is a designated COVID-19 hospital and the largest in the district.

Their clarification came after an audio clip sent out by a nursing officer at the hospital suggested that the staff's negligence had led to the death of a COVID-19 patient. In the audio clip, the nursing officer had said that a patient’s ventilator tube had not been placed properly.

Dr. A. Fathahudeen, pulmonologist and nodal officer for COVID-19 care at the hospital, said that the deceased patient mentioned in the audio clip, C. K. Haris, had been in a critical condition with pneumonia even on the day he died. The fact that he was seriously ill was communicated in the daily report sent from the hospital to the Director of Medical Education. He was on ventilator support and doctors had not considered moving him from the ICU to the ward.

Haris had been under treatment at the hospital for about three weeks and remained positive for the virus even when he died. He was overweight and had diabetes and hypertension, besides COVID-19 pneumonia, and obstructive sleep apnea that made it difficult for him to breathe when asleep. Haris was not on a mechanical ventilator but was on non-invasive ventilation where a tube is not inserted.

The nursing officer had explained that the audio message was only meant to keep her juniors aware, and it was routine to ask staff to be careful about oxygen supply, Dr. Ganesh Mohan, resident medical officer, told the media. The nursing officer was not directly involved in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients, had not interacted with the patients, and only played a supervisory role, Dr. Fathahudeen said.

A junior doctor had told TV channels on Tuesday that the audio clip was likely to be true and that ventilator tubes and oxygen masks were sometimes not placed properly. In their statement, hospital officials said that the junior doctor, working under the supervision of several specialists, had never alerted her seniors to such a problem. The junior doctor had also not been on duty when Haris died and doctors on duty at that time had not alerted the administration to any problems in his treatment, said a statement issued by Dr. Fathahudeen, Dr. V. Satheesh, Principal of the MCH, and Dr. Peter P. Vazhayil, Medical Superintendent.

False statements on purported inefficiency and lapses in treatment at the facility were being made in an attempt to besmirch the institution, their statement said.

Dr. Fathahudeen said that the patient’s family was asked to purchase a CPAP machine in order to help him breathe after his discharge from the hospital, since oxygen levels could fall even a few weeks after the patient’s recovery.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/o0bpnh/article32904458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20KI-PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/medical-college-denies-lapse-sees-plot-to-defame-institution/article32904460.ece

294,2020/10/21,Transwoman Sajana hospitalised for drug overdose,"Amidst a raging controversy over whether transwoman Sajana Shaji had made up her claim of having been stopped from selling packets of biriyani on the wayside at Thripunithura, Sajana was hospitalised in Ernakulam following a drug overdose.

A hospital spokesperson said that she was admitted to the ICU early on Tuesday after a drug overdose and her condition was stable.

After a post on social media last week in which Sajana had said that she and a few other transpersons were threatened and abused by a vendor nearby while selling biriyani packets, help was promised from all quarters. Health Minister K.K. Shylaja and actor Jayasurya were among those who offered assistance to the transwoman. But an audio clip, followed by insinuations of Sajana having made up the whole episode to rake in the moolah, soon began to circulate on the social media.

In a more recent video on Facebook, Sajana explained that apart from the help, she had faced some backlash after the incident and a few insinuations were made about the problems she faced being untrue. An audio clip, in which she was talking to a friend, was edited and circulated on social media recently, to portray her differently, she said.

Three years after being in hiding, Gorkha Janamukti Morcha (GJM) founder Bimal Gurung on Wednesday made a public appearance in Kolkata and announced that he had severed all ties with the BJP. Extending an olive branch to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Mr. Gurung said the BJP had not done anything for the Darjeeling hills.

Also read: Who is Bimal Gurung?

“I want to see Mamata Banerjee as Chief Minister for the third time in 2021,” Mr. Gurung said, adding that he wanted to ally with the Trinamool Congress in the 2021 Assembly polls to “give a fitting reply to the BJP.”

Long-time ally

Mr. Gurung has been an ally of the BJP and a constituent of the National Democratic Alliance ( NDA) for more than a decade and supported BJP candidates in the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat in the past, including in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. BJP nominee Raju Bista won the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat with a margin of over 4 lakh votes in 2019.

“The Prime Minister or Home Minister has not fulfilled the commitment made to us in the past six years. Whereas Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has fulfilled all promises she has made to every group or organisation,” Mr. Gurung told journalist in Kolkata.

Also read: Bimal Gurung charged under UAPA again

In a dramatic turn of events, the GJM founder, along with his close aide Roshan Giri, was first spotted outside the Gorkha Bhawan in Salt Lake but when the authorities refused to let him in, he held a press conference at a city hotel.

In 2017, Mr. Gurung led a violent agitation and 100-day shutdown in Darjeeling hills over the demand of separate State for Gorkhaland. After being booked under several cases, including under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Mr. Gurung had to leave the Darjeeling hills.

Another faction of the GJM led by Benoy Tamang warmed up to the Trinamool Congress and now holds control of the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), the regional autonomous body of Darjeeling hills.

Asked about the cases against him, Mr. Gurung said these were political cases. “I am not a terrorist or a murderer. These are political cases and I will fight them politically,” he said.

Reiterating his commitment for the issue of Gorkhaland, Mr. Gurung said, “Even If they arrest me, I will be happy to fight for Gorkhaland from behind bars.”

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has made elaborate arrangements for the live-viewing of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s virtual address to the people of West Bengal at 12 noon on October 22 in every polling booth across the state’s 294 Assembly constituencies.

Mr. Modi is scheduled to share his “Pujor Shubecha” (Puja greetings) message with the people of the State on October 22, when Durga Puja celebrations start there.

BJP sources said they have made arrangements across the state for more than 25 party workers and voters to watch the address in each of the over 78,000 polling booths while adhering to social-distancing norms.

In the run-up to the Prime Minister’s address, there will be a cultural programme at the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) in Kolkata from 10 a.m. on Thursday in the presence of senior West Bengal BJP leaders, they said.

The State BJP has made arrangements to telecast the exercise live.

West Bengal is scheduled to hold the Assembly polls in the first half of the next year. The BJP has emerged as the main challenger to the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and has been exuding confidence that it will end Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s 10-year-old reign in the State.

The saffron party had won 18 seats in West Bengal against the TMC’s 22 in last year’s Lok Sabha polls and trailed the ruling party in terms of vote share by only 3%.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6jita4/article32165804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/bjp-to-telecast-pm-modis-address-in-every-booth-in-west-bengal/article32909230.ece
297,2020/10/21,Calcutta HC makes minor modifications to its order but Puja pandals to remain no entry zones,"Division Bench allows a higher number of organisers to enter the Durga Puja pandals

Calcutta High Court on Wednesday made minor modifications to its order passed on Monday by allowing a higher number of organisers to enter the Durga Puja pandals but maintained that pandals will remain no entry zone and visitors will not be allowed inside.

Hearing a review petition filed by Forum of Durgotsav, a group of Durga Puja clubs, a Division Bench of Justices Sanjib Banerjee and Arijit Banerjee said that ‘dhakis’ (traditional drummers) may be permitted, not within the pandal area but in the no entry zone outside. ‘Dhakis’ will have to wear masks and maintain physical distancing norms, the court said.

For smaller Durga Puja pandals whose area is less than 300 sq metres instead of 15 organisers the chart prepared by the respective committee can include 30 names and for bigger ones the chart can include 60 names. The number stated in the order on Monday was 15 for smaller pandals and 25 for bigger ones.

The court added that charts with the name of organisers or locals who will be allowed inside the pandals should be hung up by 8 a.m. every day and all the people should not be present inside the pandal at one time. For bigger Durga Pujas 45 persons can be present inside the pandal and for smaller Durga Pujas 25 people can be present at one time.

The Court granted no other relief that will have the effect of diluting its earlier order including allowing ‘Sindur Khela’ (a ritual practised by women on Vijaydashmi before the immersion of idols).

298,2020/10/21,Puja festivities begin; Bengal sees record case surge,"The week-long Durga Puja festival in West Bengal began on Tuesday as the State recorded its highest single-day surge of 4,029 new COVID-19 cases, taking the total tally to 3,29,057.

With 61 more patients succumbing to the virus, the death toll has reached 6,180. While the active cases in the State rose to 35,170, the discharge rate marginally dropped to 87.43%. The percentage of positive cases out of the samples tested has gone up to 8.07%.

There was not much crowd outside puja pandals during the day after the Calcutta High Court on Monday directed that all pandals would be “no entry” zones for visitors. Police personnel were deployed outside several pandals in the city and the suburbs.

In a related development, Forum for Durgotsav, a consortium of Durga Puja clubs, on Tuesday filed a review petition in the HC challenging its order. The petition was admitted and the hearing would be held on Wednesday.

Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said that in view of the HC order he would have virtual participation in Durga Puja inaugurations. Mr. Dhankhar urged people to enjoy the festivities safely, and maintain social distancing, wear mask, and wash hands.

State BJP president Dilip Ghosh who had contracted the infection and was released from a private hospital during the day welcomed the HC order. “ I have been inside the hospital and seen the plight of people,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Health Department has added 2,174 beds, including 535 ICU beds for critical care patients, in State-run hospitals.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the renovated Vadakara sandbanks and Mananchira Square on Thursday through videoconferencing.

Work on the Vadakara sandbanks was executed by the Tourism Department under the Green Carpet project of the government. Rain shelters, children’s park, stone benches, water kiosks, compound wall, and a public address system are available at the renovated facility.

To keep an eye on anti-social elements, CCTV cameras, a long-pending demand from the police, were also installed at the spot. Besides, separate security cabins and a storeroom for keeping rescue accessories were constructed.

According to the Tourism Department, the government sanctioned ₹99.36 lakh for the project. Minister for Excise and Labour T.P. Ramakrishnan and K. Muraleedharan, MP, will address a local event to be held as part of the inauguration.

The Mananchira Square was beautified at a cost of ₹1.70 crore. According to officials, the space was improved with unique artistic works, stone pavements, modified entrance, ornamental lighting, and a comfort station block.

CPI(M) leader and former Kozhikode Mayor M. Bhaskaran, 80, passed away at the District Co-operative Hospital at Eranhipalam here on Wednesday.

He was undergoing treatment for various ailments for quite some time. He had been the Mayor of Kozhikode during 2005-10. He had contested the council elections since 1978, except in 1995. Also, he had been the chairman of the health and education standing committee.

Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, who is also the Chancellor of Calicut University, has sought a report from its Vice-Chancellor over the appointment of the Dean, Students’ Welfare.

This follows a complaint filed by P. Rasheed Ahammed, Syndicate member, questioning the Syndicate move to issue a notification for the post. This plan had led to criticism that the university was violating its own statutes and the Kerala Public Service Commission should have been informed about it. P.V. Valsaraj, the incumbent Dean, retires on October 31.

Mr. Ahammed had claimed that the Registrar and Controller of Examinations were the only non-teaching posts to which Syndicate can make appointment. In a letter to Mr. Khan, Mr. Ahammed had said that the university could have reported the vacancy to the KPSC to prepare a select list. He claimed that the Syndicate resolved to notify the vacancy despite his note of dissent.

An underground crematorium, probably the first of its kind in the State, is coming up at Ulliyeri grama panchayat in Kozhikode district.

Work on Prashanthi Garden, claimed to be a “model crematorium”, is under way on a 2.6-acre plot near the Palora hills.

307,2020/10/21,Calicut University accused of filing false affidavit in Kerala High Court,"Case relates to the appointment of varsity Registrar

Calicut University authorities have been accused of filing a false affidavit in the Kerala High Court in a case related to the appointment of the Registrar.

Mr. Ahammed alleged that the Syndicate had not discussed the appointment to the above posts and the Vice Chancellor had not been authorised to take a call at the meeting held on September 9.

308,2020/10/21,Action against Koyilandy drug store that sold liquid glucose as COVID-19 prophylactic,"Public health practitioner’s statement has misled people, says CAPSULE chairman

The Drugs Control Department is expected to take action against a drug store in Koyilandy in Kozhikode district, after reports emerged that glucose in liquid form was being sold there apparently as a preventive drug for COVID-19.

According to K. Sujith Kumar, Assistant Drugs Controller, the shop was found to be selling liquid glucose in bottles. “A show-cause notice will be issued to the owner of the shop. Their licence could be suspended and the drug dispensing permission will be revoked,” he told The Hindu on Tuesday. Mr. Kumar said that they searched the shop after directions from the State Drugs Controller. It is learnt that the officials have warned other shops against its sale.

E. Sukumaran, a former Deputy Director of Health and a well-known public health practitioner from Koyilandy, had earlier claimed that 25% of glucose in liquid form could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection if it is applied as nasal drops. A major newspaper published a report on this, quoting him. Later, Dr. Sukumaran also wrote an article in the same newspaper in defence of his claim. Public health activists pointed out that the sale of liquid glucose should be viewed against the backdrop of this statement.

Meanwhile, Campaign Against Pseudo Science Using Law and Ethics (CAPSULE), a platform of the Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad, has filed a complaint with the Travancore-Cochin Medical Council, which is the registration body for doctors. CAPSULE chairman U. Nandakumar said that Dr. Sukumaran’s claim neither had any scientific basis nor the support of randomised-controlled trials, which are essential for the use of any drug. Liquid glucose was yet to be proved effective to counter COVID-19. The claim had already misled a section of the society and led to widespread discussion, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/action-against-koyilandy-drug-store-that-sold-liquid-glucose-as-covid-19-prophylactic/article32904193.ece
309,2020/10/21,Welcome to the 2020 college experience,"What does joining a college in 2020 look like? We speak to first-year students across India to understand how they are making friends and attending online classes

For the two days that Nilambur-based Aswitha Raj fell unwell and had to skip online classes at Manipal University, she found an unexpected friend in her classmate Darunya. “Throughout the two days, she kept me updated with what was going on in class and shared her notes. I did not know people could care this much online,” she says.

Aswitha’s surprise at a classmate sharing notes — something that before 2020, would have been a basic expectation — is telling of the change in the essential college-going experience this year.

The freshman year is always an exciting one. For many, it marks a transition from the security of high school to the independence of college. New friendships are forged over afterparties, all-nighters, canteen hangouts, and an unsaid yet understood homesickness. How does that experience translate online?

“I have pretty much grown up with a phone in my hand,” says Madurai-based Ricky Franklin. Maintaining relationships over text is not unusual for this 18-year-old, but the main difference, he points out, “is that I have made these friends in real life first. So then while texting, you know their tone behind the words, you get when they are joking, and there is a lesser chance of misunderstanding. Getting to know a person purely via text takes more time.”

After over a month of online classes, students recall the thrill of meeting their classmates digitally. WhatsApp groups were formed in a flurry, Instagram accounts stalked, and Snapchat accounts added as students tried to figure each other out based on their curated online presence, their display pictures, and their bios. Sub-groups based on language preferences were created, allowing the normally reserved people to speak up more in their native tongues.

Getting friendly

“When we were first added to the official WhatsApp group, I personal-messaged everyone on that group saying that I know these are tough times, but I hope we could be friends. Some replied, some seen-zoned me,” Aswitha laughs, “And some numbers were actually of parents and that got awkward.”

Of the people who replied, about four or five continue to text her daily. Ricky too has made a separate WhatsApp group with three of his classmates. “The four of us just hit it off. We all have some passion that we follow other than our classes, like I’m a singer, this other guy is a sportsperson, one is a designer… ,” he says, adding, “It’s fun texting each other during class [like live commentary]. That’s not something we would have been able to do if it were a physical class.”

For the most part, however, online classes have been dry, with students complaining that paying attention becomes difficult when they cannot see their classmates or even their teacher sometimes.

Rakshika Babu, first year at Stella Maris, Chennai, is resentful that her first year of college is less fun than what she expected it to be, based on stories she heard from her seniors.

“My first reaction was, I did not sign up for this!” she says. “Moreover in online classes, in a group of over 80 students, we are hesitant to unmute ourselves and talk.”

Classes with a smaller group of students have had better luck in this department. Asian College of Journalism, Chennai, which has about 130 students this year, has admitted 12 to its Bloomberg programme. Jarshad NK, dean of ACJ-Bloomberg says they pay special attention to ensure that there is not only student to teacher communication, but also student to student. “We give them a lot of assignments in which they are forced to interact with each other after class. Within Zoom, there are breakout rooms that split up students into smaller groups for more personal interactions,” he says.

At MOP Vaishnav College for Women, Chennai, assistant professor Harinee Ravimaran sets aside 4 pm to 6 pm for students to call in to talk about whatever they wish — academic or otherwise.

Online freshers’ parties are also trying to fill the void of real-life socialising. While ACJ plans to invite people to send in their dance videos, perform songs or recite poetry live, MOP Vaishnav had the student office bearers speak to each of the batches — first, second and third years — personally.

Sunny side up

“But when it comes to knowledge sharing, the biggest advantage of online classes has been the lack of geographical boundaries,” says Jarshad. At ACJ-Bloomberg, a host of respected professionals in the field of journalism have been taking guest lectures: Pulitzer Prize winning Scillia Alecci, Raju Narisetti, formerly with The Wall Street Journal, and author Samanth Subramanian.

“We would fly experts down in the previous years, but the number of guest lecturers has gone way up this year,” says Jarshad, adding that online classes have also forced him to reinvent himself as a lecturer. “The sessions require minute-by-minute planning,” he says.

Harinee agrees that the amount of knowledge sharing in an online session is greater than it is in a regular classroom. “Not only that, sharing of resources is also immediate,” she says, explaining, “We generally advise students to do their own research after class, but once the bell rings, they would forget about that. With online classes, students have the luxury to open up another tab simultaneously, look up video explainers and share them immediately.”

What this also does is encourage those students who were otherwise reserved in class, and that is Harinee’s greatest joy. “There are students in my final year who for the past two years would sit in the back benches and either sleep or just not interact. They have now started responding and asking doubts in the chatbox.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/education/colleges/szy6jb/article32908635.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-967899642,https://www.thehindu.com/education/colleges/joining-a-college-in-2020-online-classes-virtual-batchmates/article32908636.ece
310,2020/10/21,Shifting of bus shelter on Melur Road can ease traffic congestion,"‘Traffic police had long ago objected to the location of the bus stop’

Traffic congestion on Melur Road opposite State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) depot in K.K. Nagar is a common sight.

It is more pronounced during peak hours and whenever an SETC bus attempts to set out from the depot to go to MGR Bus Stand at Mattuthavani.

The long-sized buses find it difficult to take a sharp left turn on to Melur Road on the narrow stretch of road. And they often block the entire Madurai-Melur lane and also come dangerously close to the opposite lane.

The location of the bus shelter on Mattuthavani-K.K Nagar lane opposite to the SETC depot adds to the congestion.

“This is the narrowest portion of the long road. That is why the median put up all along the road has not be erected on this stretch. But the halting of buses entering the city at this stop often leads to traffic jam,” said S. Jeyakaran, 58, manager of a private hospital in the vicinity.

The attempt by vehicles, especially two-wheelers, to take a U-turn after refueling at a petrol pump near Central Vegetable Market and vehicles coming out of the vegetable market to proceed towards Melur add to the chaotic situation, Mr. Jeyakaran added.

Share autos stopping haphazardly at the bus stop results in buses halting in the middle of the road, which chokes vehicular movement at the spot. Besides, those who alight from the buses often meet with accidents when they attempt to cross the road from behind the stationary buses.

“Traffic police had long ago objected to the location of the bus stop,” an official in Madurai City Traffic wing said.

When this proposal to erect the bus shelter was mooted in 2016-17, traffic police had disapproved of the move citing fatal road accidents on the stretch.

“The officials then suggested shifting of the bus shelter a few metres ahead near Kaliamman temple at Mattuthavani,” the police officer said.

That stretch along Melur Road is part of the wider portion of the road. Besides, there is lot of vacant space on the left side of the road. At present, a couple of vulcanising centres are functioning there. Even parking of large trucks and buses do not pose obstacles to the free movement of vehicles.

“If the bus shelter is shifted there, a huge bus bay could be created for safe halting of vehicles,” he added.

Agreeing with the police official, Mr. Jeyakaran says since there is no opening of the median at the spot, people would not attempt to cross the road near the proposed bus stop.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/w8rh5v/article32911315.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA22-BUSSTOP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/shifting-of-bus-shelter-on-melur-road-can-ease-traffic-congestion/article32911316.ece

People can apply for the pass with the Superintendent of Police or the Inspector concerned. Any violation would be viewed seriously and invite action under Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Act.

Elaborate security arrangements would be in place for crowd management, barricades would be placed and and large number of police personnel would be deployed on routes entering the district.

Vehicles from other districts should stick to the routes mentioned in the permission order and any violation would be viewed seriously.

This act of the former judge was highly condemnable, and to allow this kind of mischievousness and perversity was against human ethos that they as citizens wished to always uphold irrespective of gender, religion or caste. “We are governed by the rule of law and judges are no exception,” a joint statement said.

If he had genuine allegations against other judges, he could have used other avenues available in law, they added.

Former AIADMK MLA of Vilaathikulam G.V. Markandeyan, who recently joined the DMK, submitted a petition to Vilaathikulam police three days ago seeking permission for hoisting the party flag in front of the bus stand. While giving permission to Mr. Markandeyan, the police made it clear that the DMK cadre, while gathering for flag hoisting, should not disrupt vehicular traffic and should wear masks besides ensuring physical distancing. The police also told him that public address system should not be used.

Against this, backdrop, the AIADMK cadre also sought permission from the police on Wednesday morning to hoist the party flag near the bus stand but the police denied permission. However, the ruling party cadre said Vilaathikulam MLA Chinnappan and the cadre would hoist the flag even without police permission.

As trouble was brewing since morning, around 200 police personnel were deployed near Vilaathikulam bus stand on Tuesday evening itself.

After Thoothukudi MLA Geetha Jeevan hoisted the DMK flag around 5 p.m., Mr. Chinnappan came in procession along with the AIADMK cadre on Soorankudi Road towards the spot where the DMK cadre had assembled.

When the police stopped them, the AIADMK cadre led by Mr. Chinnappan picked up a heated argument with the police and the situation compelled the police to use mild force to disperse them. After the DMK cadre left the spot, Mr. Chinnappan and the ruling party cadre staged road roko in front of the bus stand and the agitation was withdrawn a few minutes later after DIG, Tirunelveli Range, Praveen Kumar Abinapu, held talks.

317,2020/10/21,Appoint legal advisor in every district to assist Education department: HC,"‘Due to lack of proper legal advice, wrong orders are being passed by authorities affecting government’s interest’

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has suggested that the State government appoint a qualified legal advisor in every district to provide proper assistance to educational authorities.

It has pointed out to a number of cases related to the Education Department being filed before the Madras High Court and its Madurai Bench.

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that the Revenue Department has a personal assistant (legal) to assist the Collector. Every Commissioner of Police is provided with a legal advisor. Similarly, every District Chief Educational Officer should have a legal officer to advise them.

It is appropriate to have a legal advisor so that proper counsel can be obtained before the educational authorities pass any order. Due to lack of proper legal advice, many a time wrong orders are being passed by the authorities and the interest of the department is affected, the court said.

The court was hearing a petition filed by educational authorities to condone the delay of 543 days in filing a writ appeal preferred against a single judge order.

Considering the issue involved in the writ appeal, the court said it was constrained to condone the delay and officials responsible for the delay should be taken to task.

No proper explanation was given by the department for the huge delay, except mentiong various dates. The lethargic attitude of the authorities cannot put the department as well as the State’s interest in jeopardy. The officials are expected to act swiftly, especially when it affects the State’s interest, the judges said.

In many cases, fearing action under contempt of court, officials file appeals before the High Court, which will definitely cause loss to the state exchequer and also affect the government’s interest. Some kind of responsibility should be fixed on the officials.

The court suo motu impleaded the Secretary to the School Education Department and the Director of Elementary Education as respondents in the case.

It directed the respondents to take a decision in this regard and file a report to the court. The case was adjourned to October 28.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/appoint-legal-advisor-in-every-district-to-assist-education-department-hc/article32910333.ece

Only those with a valid pass, which includes the name of the driver, vehicle registration certificate/number (should be own board and not a taxi) and the names of occupants, which shall not exceed five persons, would be permitted.

324,2020/10/21,Fine slapped on farmer for illegal felling of trees,"Forest department has slapped a fine of ₹5,000 on a farmer for cutting trees on his land close to the reserve forest area without obtaining mandatory permission.

Sources in the Forest department told The Hindu that farmer Perumal Muthu, who had his land just a km away from the boundary of reserve forests in the Kozhunthumaamalai beat near Govindaperi, approached the forest department for getting the mandatory permission for felling 106 teak trees, each aged about 14 years. As per norms, the grower should get permission from the forest department for cutting trees if the land is situated 5 km from the forest boundary.

Since the permission had to be given by officials at highest level, the delay irked both the farmer and the prospective buyers of timbers, who decided to go ahead with the cutting of trees with the cooperation of a few lower level forest personnel.Armed with the lower level personnel’s advice of paying the fine for cutting the trees without the permission, the trees were felled recently and cut into pieces for easy transport. While 50 trees are yet to be transported from the spot, other timbers had already reached the designated destinations, the sources added.

Meanwhile, a team of senior officials, on getting information about illegal felling of trees, visited the spot and slapped a fine of ₹5,000 on Perumal Muthu.

“Felling of 36 trees was confirmed and the fine was imposed on the farmer for cutting the trees without permission. The cut trees were just poles and not huge logs and hence only ₹5,000 was imposed,” said Deputy Director (in charge), Kalakkad – Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve’s Kalakkad division.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/fine-slapped-on-farmer-for-illegal-felling-of-trees/article32909740.ece
325,2020/10/21,Bridge collapse: civic body faces disciplinary action,"“It failed to ensure proper structural design and construction”

The Tamil Nadu Local Bodies Ombudsman has directed the Director of Town Panchayats to initiate disciplinary proceedings against Thirukkurunkudi town panchayat officials for failing to ensure proper design and construction of a two-year-old bridge that collapsed in November 2017.

The 32.48 metre-long bridge with a vent height of 4.45 metres was constructed in September 2015 with funding of ₹40 lakh from NABARD. It is situated on Nambithalaivanpattayam – Aavaaranthalai Road across the Nambiyar. The bridge collapsed on November 30, 2017. Though the local body put the blame on increased discharge of water from Kodumudiyar dam following heavy rain in catchment areas triggered by Cyclone Ockhi, the public alleged that inferior construction and poor design of the vents led to the collapse of the bridge which was used by over 4,000 people from five villages.

Though the duration of the construction was six months, the contractor completed it within three months and 10 days, raising doubts that improper curing should have been one of the reasons for the collapse.

Demanding a comprehensive probe, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam staged a demonstration at Thirukkurunkudi and sought action against the officials who compromised on quality of construction and design of the bridge. MDMK’s Tirunelveli rural district secretary T.M. Rajendran filed a complaint with the Ombudsman and sought action against the officials and probe by experts.

Meanwhile, R. Sekar of Vanniyankudiyiruppu also filed a complaint with the Ombudsman saying ₹15 lakh allocated by the panchayat for the construction of a parapet on this bridge had been misappropriated without constructing it.

When a technical committee from Anna University inspected the collapsed bridge, it identified various design flaws uch as improper location of piers that caused excess lateral thrust on one of the piers, inadequate design of scour depth and scour protection measures. The technical committee also raised doubts over quality of concrete and improper curing.

The Thirukkurunkudi town panchayat, while maintaining that the sudden discharge of 19,000 cusecs of water from Kodumudiyar dam on that day led to the collapse of the bridge, did not submit any substantial evidence to prove it. The petitioner refuted this claim saying Cyclone Ockhi that ravaged neighbouring Kanniyakumari district had spared Tirunelveli district.

Accepting the petitioner’s averments based on evidences submitted by him and the experts’ technical report, the Ombudsman, headed by former civil servant S. Ayyar, directed the Director of Town Panchayats to take disciplinary action against all the officials concerned.

Now, ₹96 lakh has been allotted for construction of a new bridge.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/l3ft9i/article32909682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22MATVL-BRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/bridge-collapse-civic-body-faces-disciplinary-action/article32909683.ece

328,2020/10/21,Current market rally is broad-based: SEBI’s Tyagi,"‘India logged $11 bn in net FPI inflows’

The current stock market rally, in the backdrop of the challenging times caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, has been broad-based with large and mid-cap stocks gaining 55% and small-cap stocks 70% Ajay Tyagi, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) said on Wednesday.

Stating that the secondary markets reacted adversely in March following the declaration of pandemic, with lower circuit breaker getting triggereding on two occasions within a span of two weeks – an occurrence which that had never happened in the past — he said the volatility index, or VIX, rose to 84 in March from an average of 15 in the previous three months.

Mr. Tyagi said the markets had since recovered with SEBI taking timely surveillance mesures with respect to exposures and margins to curb volatility.

“The Sensex/Nifty today is very close to the all-time high hit in January,” he said.

“Volatility has also relatively stabilised with the VIX now hovering at around 25,” Mr. Tyagi said at a virtual Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) event.

On the narrative that liquidity and low interest rates were primarily boosting the markets and that there had been a disconnect between the markets and the real economy, the regulator said the recovery had been broad-based owing to SEBI’s policy measures.

“It is not just the large-cap but also mid- and small-cap indices which have recovered since the lows hit in March,” he said.

Rising investor interest

He said investor participation in the equity market had risen, with the average daily turnover in the cash market in this financial year about ₹60,000 crore, or 54% higher than last year.

“The equity derivatives segment has also seen the average daily turnover grow by around 27%. The average daily turnover in both the cash market and equity derivatives hit their all-time high figures in June and September 2020,” he said.

He said during April- September this year 2020, 63 lakh new demat accounts were added compared with 27.4 lakh accounts in the same period last year, up 130%. He also said India had received about $11 billion in net FPI investments in the equity markets, till date in this financial year.

“While most emerging markets, including Brazil, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, South Africa and Malaysia, have witnessed FPI outflows this calendar year so far, India has witnessed net FPI inflows during the same period,” he added.

Mutal funds had recorded net inflows of ₹1.47 lakh crore in this financial year till September, he said, adding that in the case of primary markets, the total funds raised had touched ₹1.54 lakh crore till September, just short of the ₹1.58 lakh crore raised during the same period last year.

IPOs oversubscribed

“Almost all IPOs and rights issues this year have been oversubscribed several times. Further, over ₹22,000 crore equity issuances are in the pipeline.”

He also said the funds raised through corporate bonds this financial year till September was about ₹3.8 lakh crore, or 25% more than the year-earlier period.

“SEBI’s policy measures have somewhat contributed in facilitating the rather satisfactory working of both the primary and secondary markets in these gloomy and uncertain times.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/bgzkog/article32911755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THBUTYAGI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/current-market-rally-is-broad-based-sebis-tyagi/article32911756.ece
329,2020/10/21,Economy almost at doorstep of revival: Das,"‘Lenders raising capital to ensure credit for businesses upon revival of economy’

India’s economy is ‘almost at the doorstep of revival’, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das asserted on Wednesday, adding that banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) had raised, or were in the process of raising, capital to ensure adequate credit availability for businesses once the revival took hold.

The RBI’s monetary policy and the government’s fiscal policy were working in symmetry with an expansionary focus and an accommodative as well as counter-cyclical stance, Mr. Das said. The government would have to revisit its fiscal roadmap once the worst effects of the pandemic had been contained, he added.

Stressing the need for urgent governance reforms in both public and private sector banks and NBFCs, Mr. Das said this had been a lingering concern since the 2008 global financial crisis and needed attention.

“At this juncture, reforms in governance of banks and non-banking finance companies, especially in India, are very important. People mostly mix up banking reforms with ownership reforms,” he noted.

“Banks with robust governance practices, internal control systems, risk assessment and who do not undertake smart accounting, if I can put it that way, are the ones that are never overleveraged and not only survive, but grow in every crisis,” he said, adding that this was an ownership-agnostic issue.

Mr. Das was speaking at an event to release Portraits of Power, an autobiography of N.K. Singh, Chairman of the 15th Finance Commission.

“Post COVID-19, once the pandemic is contained, the government will certainly have to spell out a fiscal roadmap to adhere to the [60%] debt-to-GDP target that Mr. Singh and his committee [to review the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management law] had set out,” Mr. Das said, pointing out that the general government [Centre and States’] deficit was already exceeding the targets for this year.

“India is at the doorstep of revival process after the effects of the pandemic. And it’s very important that financial entities have adequate capital. Many of them have already raised capital, others in public and private sector are planning and would certainly do so in the coming months,” he said.

The RBI had asked all banks and NBFCs to build capital buffers so that credit is available to support growth when the economy’s revival phase begins, the central bank chief added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/xtkpp1/article32911626.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THBUDAS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/economy-almost-at-doorstep-of-revival-das/article32911627.ece

Ma Huateng, founder of Tencent, which operates the popular WeChat messaging service, was No. 2 at $57.4 billion, up 50%. Debuting at No. 3 was Zhong Shanshan, chairman of bottled water brand Nongfu Spring, with $53.7 billion following his company’s Hong Kong stock market debut in September.

Rising share prices created an average of five new Chinese entrepreneurs worth at least $1 billion every week over the past year, according to Hurun’s founder, Rupert Hoogewerf.

“The world has never seen this much wealth created in just one year,” said Hoogewerf in a statement. “China’s entrepreneurs have done much better than expected. Despite Covid-19 they have risen to record levels.”

The richest woman on the list was Yang Huiyan of real estate developer Country Garden. She was No. 6 at $33 billion, up 29% from last year.

Rankings of China’s richest change abruptly from year to year as real estate, technology and other industries rise and fall in the fast-evolving economy.

This year, the coronavirus boosted the fortunes of Alibaba’s Ma and other internet entrepreneurs as the shutdown of the Chinese economy to fight the virus propelled demand for online shopping and business tools.

Li Yongxin of Offcn, an online work training platform, more than doubled to $20.6 billion. Chen Xiangdong of tutoring platform Genshuixue rose eightfold to $11.8 billion.

Ma, 56, retired as Alibaba chairman last year and also is a shareholder in Ant Group, a payments service spun off from Alibaba. It is preparing for a public share offering after being valued at $150 billion in a 2017 private financing round, which will add to Ma’s fortune.

Entrepreneurs in electric cars, an industry the ruling Communist Party is promoting, also saw their fortunes swell.

Zeng Yuqun of battery producer CATL tripled to $17.6 billion. He Xiaopeng of electric car brand Xpeng, rose 80% to $6.6 billion following a stock market debut in New York. Li Bin of NIO rose 300% to $3.5 billion.

Business leaders who tumbled down the list included Ren Zhengfei, founder of Chinese tech giant Huawei. U.S. export controls imposed in a feud with Beijing over technology and security threaten to cripple its sales of smartphones and switching equipment. Ren’s net worth declined 10% to $2.8 billion, according to Hurun.

333,2020/10/21,"Cathay Pacific cuts 8,500 jobs, shutters regional airline","Executive pay cuts will also continue throughout 2021

Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific Airways said Wednesday it would cut 8,500 jobs and shut a regional airline as it grapples with the plunge in air travel due to the coronavirus pandemic.

About 5,300 employees based in Hong Kong and another 600 elsewhere will likely lose their jobs, and 2,600 unfilled positions will be cut. The cuts are about 24 per cent of the company’s workforce, Cathay Pacific said in a statement.

The company will also shut down Cathay Dragon, its regional airline unit, with operations ceasing from Wednesday. It will seek regulatory approval for most of the routes to be operated by Cathay Pacific and its budget airlines subsidiary HK Express.

The restructuring is aimed at reducing Cathay Pacific’s cash burn to 500 million Hong Kong dollars (USD 64.5 million) a month, from about 1.5 billion Hong Kong dollars (USD 193.5 million) to 2 billion Hong Kong (USD 258 million) dollars currently, Cathay Pacific CEO Augustus Tang said in a statement.

“The global pandemic continues to have a devastating impact on aviation and the hard truth is we must fundamentally restructure the Group to survive,” Tang said.

“We have to do this to protect as many jobs as possible, and meet our responsibilities to the Hong Kong aviation hub and our customers.” The restructuring plan will cost about 2.2 billion Hong Kong dollars (USD 283.8 million), the company said.

Executive pay cuts will also continue throughout 2021 and there will be no pay increments for 2021 nor bonuses for this year for all Hong Kong employees, Cathay Pacific said. Ground staff will also be offered a voluntary leave plan in the first half of next year.

In June, Cathay Pacific raised 39 billion Hong Kong dollars (USD 5 billion) in a recapitalization plan that gave the city’s government a stake of about 6 per cent in the airline.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/k9f73q/article24204078.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20CATHAYPACIFIC,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/cathay-pacific-cuts-8500-jobs-shutters-regional-airline/article32905792.ece
334,2020/10/21,Amazon extends work from home option till June,"The latest guidance is applicable globally, says the company’s spokeswoman

Amazon.com Inc on Tuesday told employees whose work can be done from home that they can do so until June, extending the timeline on a return to office due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Employees who work in a role that can effectively be done from home are welcome to do so until June 30, 2021”, an Amazon spokeswoman said in an emailed statement on Tuesday, adding the guidance is applicable globally.

Amazon had earlier allowed that option until January.

The development comes less than three weeks after the world's largest online retailer said more than 19,000 of its U.S. frontline workers contracted the coronavirus this year.

Some staff, elected officials and unions in recent months have said that Amazon put employees' health at risk by keeping warehouses open during the pandemic.

“We have invested significant funds and resources to keep those who choose to come to the office safe through physical distancing, deep cleaning, temperature checks, and by providing face coverings and hand sanitizer,” the Amazon spokeswoman said on Tuesday.

In May, Twitter Inc became the first major tech company to allow employees who can work remotely to do so indefinitely.

Other tech giants have extended the work from home option for their employees with Microsoft Corp saying earlier this month it will let most employees work remotely for up to half their weekly working hours.

Facebook Inc had said it would allow its employees to work from home till July next year, while Google had extended the remote working period for employees who do not need to be in the office till June",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/41p7r/article32719941.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THAPAMAZON,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/amazon-extends-work-from-home-option-till-june/article32905729.ece

CLUE: Roaming freely in train leads to thrilling experiences (9)

Clue types : Anagram, acronym letter-pick

Definition : Roaming

Answer : ITINERANT

Clue explained:

Here we’re looking for a 9-letter word. It should be a synonym of the clue’s definition. And as you would know by now, the definition of a clue is almost always found at either the beginning of the clue or the end.

So, the definition could be a synonym of ‘roaming’. Or maybe or ‘experiences’. Or maybe even of ‘thrilling experiences’. So, let’s use the words in between to make sense of it all and see if that gives us a hint about which is the definition.

‘Freely’ can possibly be an anagrind (a word that indicates an anagram). An anagram is always a useful device for us solvers because it gifts us a bunch of the letters from the answer. So, if we were to anagram the adjacent words ‘in train’, and put them in a different order, we have the letters ITINRAN. Now, look at that weird set of letters and see if it reminds you of a synonym for either of our two shortlisted definitions, ‘roaming’ or ‘experiences’. To me, it already reads like “itinerant”, which is another word for ‘roaming’. So...

... If ‘roaming’ is really the definition to this clue and ‘freely’ is the anagrind and ‘in train’ is part of the anagram fodder, then there are still four more words left for us to work out within the wordplay — ‘leads to thrilling experiences’.

Now, when you see a phrase like ‘leads to’, your mind should automatically imagine that the setter is hinting at the starting letters of the adjacent word/s. The starting letters of ‘thrilling experiences’ are T and E.

And if you anagram (as indicated by ‘freely’) the letters of ‘in train’ as well as T and E, you certainly get ITINERANT, which, if your mind is still and focussed, you would immediately recognise as the 9-letter word that means ‘roaming’!",,https://crossword.thehindu.com/clued-in/kxgku4/article32904248.ece/alternates/FREE_660/bazinga-ball-pit,https://crossword.thehindu.com/clued-in/clued-in-160-crosswords-a-place-where-the-mind-can-roam-free/article32904197.ece
343,2020/10/21,Flawed Foreigners Tribunal,"Cases of suspected foreigners are decided arbitrarily and callously

Nurjahan Nessa was asked to prove that she is Indian before Foreigners Tribunal No. 4 in Hajo, Assam, in 2016. She produced several documents based on which the tribunal declared her Indian. Nessa was one of the very few suspected foreigners who got an opportunity to defend themselves before this tribunal. We analysed 818 orders passed by this Foreigners Tribunal between June 16, 2017 and December 30, 2019, obtained through the Right To Information Act, and found that 96% were decided ex parte. Also, the orders were inconsistent, vague and biased.

Claims by the police

A majority of the orders followed set templates with only the names of persons, police stations, and dates being changed. The descriptions of investigations by the police are questionable. In 733 cases, the police claim to have met the suspected foreigners. The police asked these suspected foreigners to produce documentary proof of their citizenship, and 570 of them allegedly produced no documents (the remaining orders did not mention whether any documents were produced). It is hard to believe that when it comes to a matter as serious as citizenship, 570 people could not produce even a scrap of paper furthering their claim. In 218 of these cases, the police went on to declare that the suspected foreigners were from Bangladesh (mostly from Maimansingh). Apart from these alleged meetings with the suspected foreigners, the orders do not allude to any other investigation by the police.

Although the police claimed they were able to meet suspected foreigners before submitting their inquiry report, in at least 98% of such cases, they were unable to locate the suspected foreigners subsequently to serve a notice to appear before the tribunal. The police alleged that these persons were not residents of their earlier locality and could not be traced despite their asking local residents and gaonburahs (village headmen). A practising advocate revealed that in some of his cases, the gaonburahsalso appeared as witnesses for the suspected foreigners and confirmed that they were not questioned by the police as to the whereabouts of these suspected foreigners. Foreigners Tribunals do not allow for the police to be cross-examined, thereby leaving no room to disprove or challenge submissions made by them regarding their alleged meetings with the suspected foreigners and their subsequent inability to find them. All this works out conveniently for the police and the tribunals given the anxiety in Assam about finding and deporting Bangladeshis. Unlike regular criminal trials where an accused is presumed not guilty and the state has to prove that he committed a crime, the burden of proof under the Foreigners Act of 1946 is on the accused. If a person fails to appear before the Foreigners Tribunal, it can pass an order declaring him a foreigner ex parte, without allowing him an opportunity to defend himself. In all the ex parte orders, the police produced no evidence to indicate that the suspected foreigners were not Indian, yet the latter were declared Bangladeshi.

A desperate search for Bangladeshis

Only in 31 cases were the suspected foreigners allowed to refute the allegations made against them. All these 31 orders were passed by the same tribunal member. The progression of her career as a member of the Foreigners Tribunal gives us an inkling of how the desperate search for Bangladeshis in Assam has tainted the quasi-judicial process of adjudicating citizenship claims. She was appointed as a member of the tribunal in July 2015 on a contractual basis. On June 20, 2017, she was denied an extension along with several other members because she had not declared enough people as foreigners. She was reinstated only after she and the others challenged the termination of their services before the Gauhati High Court.

Since most of the cases analysed were decided ex parte, we expected that these proceedings would have at least been swift. This tribunal took an average of 10 years to dispose of a case. It is interesting to note that 92% of the cases analysed were disposed of in 2018 and 2019 alone. In 82% of the cases, the police gave the tribunal reports of service of notice in 2018 and 2019, although some cases dated as far back as 1999. The cases appear to have been kept in cold storage for several years and disposed of with undue haste in 2018 and 2019. On average, the tribunal took 39 days from the date of receipt of this report to pass an ex parte order.

The tribunal ordered the deportation of the suspected foreigners in 97% of these cases. However, very few, if any, will actually be deported since deportation requires Bangladesh to accept the deportees. Assam’s Parliamentary Affairs Minister said only 227 persons were deported between March 13, 2013 and July 31, 2020.

There is an urgent need to make the procedure followed by the Foreigners Tribunal fair and transparent. The claims of 19 lakh people excluded from the National Register of Citizens will go before these tribunals. Their cases cannot be decided arbitrarily and callously as they have been in the past.

344,2020/10/21,"In the U.S., it could go either way","Candidates ought not to find reasons for complacency

With scarcely two weeks of campaigning remaining before voting day in the U.S. presidential election, it appears that the Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, is building a considerable lead over the incumbent, President Donald Trump. However, there are warning signs that the Democrats would be unwise to take the prospect of victory for granted.

First, consider the onslaught of the pandemic, which brought the U.S. economy to its knees. A grinding slowdown in business activity led to a historic high in unemployment levels (14.7%) in April 2020. While the joblessness rate has come down since, it has put the spotlight on the federal government’s failure to respond with an agile, science-driven pandemic strategy that could have saved lives and refloated the economy.

Also read: The U.S. election just became more uncertain

Many may now consider Mr. Trump a bungling commander-in-chief, who attacked masks, lockdowns and social distancing as Democratic scare tactics. Yet — and this is where it is important to understand the psyche of American society — there is a considerable segment of voters — mostly white, in semi-urban and rural areas, either blue collar workers or small business owners — who genuinely abhor diktats on mask-wearing and dread the crushing economic impact of lockdowns. This is why, even though the latest polls suggest that north of 53% of Americans disapproved of Mr. Trump’s performance of his job and only a little more than 41% approved, his approval ratings have remained stable. Not only does this reflect that Mr. Trump likely has a core cohort of supporters who are intensely loyal and will vote for him, it is also driven by the intensifying partisan polarisation of voters — namely the fact that over the course of his term in office, an average of 87% of Republicans have approved of Mr. Trump’s handling of the job, compared with an average of only 6% of Democrats.

Second, the election outcome will be driven to a large extent by undecided and independent voters, many of them situated in swing states. Currently, Mr. Biden enjoys a lead in the swing states of Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona and Michigan, whereas Mr. Trump holds the lead in Ohio and Iowa. However, a caveat that most sensible analysts of opinion polls underscore is that these polls undercounted Trump supporters in 2016, and there is no clarity on whether they have corrected this; and also that the same polls may be overcounting Democratic support given the likelihood that more people may express support for Mr. Biden than actually turn out on voting day.

Anecdotal evidence from battleground states suggests that undecided voters are seeing the election as a choice between an incumbent with a weak character but a Republican-based economic policy that lifted up the economy until COVID-19 struck; and a challenger who has integrity of character — read as ‘not prone to abuse people on social media and elsewhere’ — but might raise crushing taxes on the middle classes.

The possibility of a showdown

Third, the historically unfounded controversy whipped up by Mr. Trump around mail-in voting has the potential to dent Democratic prospects as election month rolls around. In a survey by the Pew Research Center, 50% of Trump supporters said they would cast their votes in person versus 20% of Biden supporters. Similarly, 51% of Biden supporters said they would vote or already have voted by absentee or mail-in ballot compared with 25% of Trump supporters. With Republicans rushing to confirm a conservative Supreme Court nominee and Mr. Trump refusing to commit to a peaceful transition of power, the stage may soon be set for a political showdown of biblical proportions that sees the election outcome decided in court.

These factors point to swirling uncertainty over which of the two candidates hold sway. Regardless of opinion polls — proved wrong in predicting the 2016 outcome — neither candidate ought to find reasons for complacency in this terrain, during these final, critical days of campaigning.

345,2020/10/21,Towards fewer deaths in Tamil Nadu,"The government should consider adopting a range of measures to reduce the number of COVID-19 fatalities

The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to rage across the world. Europe is trying to tackle the second wave of cases and deaths. Its worried leaders are implementing frantic measures to prevent the spread of the disease and reduce the mortality rate.

India’s COVID-19 spread

India is caught in the first wave. It is slowly inching towards beating the U.S. in terms of cases and assuming the no. 1 position in the world, despite the amateurish way in which the U.S. is handling the pandemic. Why has India been unable to achieve what China or other East Asian countries have been able to achieve? One view is that India is not an authoritarian state like China. But India did impose a stringent lockdown in March when the country had just over 600 recorded cases. But now, to save the economy, it has been forced to open up despite having over 75 lakh cases.

Many experts say the lockdown was premature, and the way it was implemented led to the spread of COVID-19 from major urban centres like Mumbai and Chennai to rural pockets in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, etc. Another view is that it did not prevent the spread much but only delayed the peak. Also, with movement restrictions imposed between States and districts, the virus was seen spreading at different rates in different districts and peaking at different times. As a result, India saw an increase in the number of cases and reached the peak in September. Hopefully, the decline in cases will continue. Unlike in Spain, Italy, France, etc., India did not reach the peak rapidly perhaps because districts were compartmentalised. We must now be prepared for the second wave if a vaccine or a proven cure is not found in the near future.

Fortunately, India’s mortality rate is not as alarming as in the Western countries; with 1,08,000 COVID-19 deaths till October 10, India’s deaths per million is 78, against the world average of 138. The country’s younger age profile is cited as one reason. Natural immunity to the virus thanks to large-scale use of malarial drugs and the BCG vaccine might be another. Fortunately, India has suffered low mortality despite poor tertiary healthcare facilities in most States. Whatever may be the reasons, we hope that this holds up till the end. The main issue for policymakers is what can be done at this stage to keep cases and deaths under check.

The Tamil Nadu picture

Let me attempt to answer this question with reference to Tamil Nadu, a State with which I am familiar. The number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu crossed 10,000 recently. Although the accuracy of this number is questionable, as it is with other States, this is the official figure, and we have to accept it for want of any independent survey. The question is whether the State has done better than others and whether anything more can be done to reduce mortality.

In view of data inaccuracies, a useful measure of mortality is deaths per million/lakh of the population. The data for a few States are furnished in the table above. Surprisingly, Tamil Nadu has not done that well despite excellent tertiary healthcare infrastructure. Tamil Nadu has seen 14 deaths per lakh of the population against the national average of 7.8. This is far higher than Kerala’s figure of 3 deaths per lakh of the population. The State must attempt to reduce new deaths going forward.

Also read: Coronavirus | Tamil Nadu continues to see a dip in cases

It is time to spell out what can be done to contain mortality, given the possibility of a second wave hitting us with no credible vaccine in place in time. Here are some suggestions. The State government along with many task forces and the best medical brains is already implementing some or many of these ideas.

Suggestions to contain mortality

We have handled the pandemic mostly as a law and order problem, whereas it is primarily a public health issue. Therefore, public health professionals must lead the fight against the virus.

The primary responsibility to prevent the spread lies with the public, most of whom do not seem to care. They must follow the guidelines strictly.

Also read: Coronavirus | Over 6 lakh have recovered so far in Tamil Nadu

However, the government also has a duty to properly educate them. It could launch an effective media campaign to bring high awareness among the public. My interactions with the public reveal considerable deficiency of information. Printed handouts must be given to every household along with media advertisements. In addition to well-known measures such as wearing masks and physical distancing, the public must be warned of the danger of being in a closed environment. They must be told how to seek timely medical assistance. An independent survey on public awareness should be conducted to create better awareness.

Saving lives is the primary responsibility of the government. It is not that the government is unaware or has not done anything, but it must set a goal so that the number of new deaths per lakh is reduced further. This is achievable if there is a coordinated effort by the State Health Department. A helpline for fever for every city, which is run by medical professionals, would be useful to detect early cases of fever. Doctors may guide patients with fever symptoms through telemedicine. Private medical personnel may also be roped in. Most are now familiar with WhatsApp and can therefore access telemedicine services. This will enhance confidence in the public of handling an episode of fever. Reporting will be better in this arrangement.

Patients could be guided for testing for COVID-19 wherever necessary. In case of a positive result, the patient may be given an option of quarantining at home or a government facility. A trained doctor must take over at this stage and guide the home-quarantined patients towards recovery through telemedicine.

Whenever any patient needs hospital care, he must be able to get immediate admission, with help from government online data on bed availability in public and private hospitals. This bed management requires some effort. The private sector must be persuaded to come on board — the government must avoid any attempt to fix the price. The online system must be accessible to the public and managed by the Health Department to ensure data accuracy. A public health professional may be posted in each hospital to assist patients in admission.

Another important task is to publish standard treatment guidelines. Given the innumerable research findings pouring from across the world, these guidelines cannot be static but modified regularly. This would help all medical professionals to know the latest treatment protocol.

To protect senior citizens who are at high risk, the government could delay renewal of their driving licence, ration cards, etc.

Smooth running of an efficient mechanism is difficult and requires many administrative leaders at different levels. The day a common man can immediately get a free bed in a government hospital or a paid bed in a private hospital is the beginning of our effective control of the mortality rate. We hope that this day will come soon.

346,2020/10/21,The many bright spots on India’s innovation horizon,"Recognising the potential, the government is putting in place a framework of collaboration, facilitation and regulation

Innovation rearranges existing elements into permutations and combinations that benefit society. In his Brāhmaphutasiddhānta, Brahmagupta’s marvellous take on his innovation of zero was, “A debt minus zero is a debt. A fortune minus zero is a fortune. A debt subtracted from zero is a fortune. A fortune subtracted from zero is a debt. The product of zero multiplied by a debt or fortune is zero.” The Indian innovation of zero fundamentally reordered history. The novel coronavirus pandemic provides an opportunity for similar reordering for posterity.

Realistic potential

India is a fertile ground to be a technology-led innovation garage. It is the fastest growing country in terms of Internet usage, with over 700 million users and the number projected to rise to 974 million by 2025. The JAM trinity (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile) trinity has 404 million Jan Dhan bank accounts with 1.2 billion Aadhaar and 1.2 billion mobile subscribers. There is a potential to add over $957 billion to India’s GDP by 2035 with artificial intelligence (AI), according to a recent report by Accenture.

Innovation in India is being structured around the triad of collaboration, facilitation and responsible regulation. It is advanced by cross-disciplinary collaboration. In his famous essay, ‘I Pencil’, Leonard Read brings forward the wonder of collaboration between people cutting trees, mining graphite, working in factories, marketing, designing and managing, just to produce a single pencil.

Innovation is a recombinant and brings tangential benefits through products and services that may not even have been its initial purpose. The founders of Twitter had set out to make a platform for people to find podcasts; Instagram was first intended to be a sign-in application; CRISPR, or the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, which is the transformative gene editing tool, was partly being researched for fixing problems in the yoghurt industry. It won this year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The realistic potential of technology for India resonates in the ‘Amara law’ named after Roy Amara, a Stanford computer scientist, who said that “People tend to overestimate the impact of a new technology in the short run, but to underestimate it in the long run.”

October 2020 saw two disruptive events that were organised by the Government of India for collaborative knowledge creation. At the Vaishvik Bharatiya Vaigyanik (VAIBHAV) summit (https://bit.ly/35aC3O8), which was inaugurated on October 2, more than 3,000 overseas Indian-origin academicians and scientists from 55 countries, and about 10,000 Indians participated to ideate on innovative solutions to our challenges. The Prime Minister articulated this spirit of knowledge sharing while inaugurating the summit; he called it “a true sangam or confluence of great minds” where “we sit to form our long-lasting association for empowering India and our planet”. The concluding session has been planned on October 31. This has been concomitant to the Responsible AI for Social Empowerment (RAISE) 2020 summit (https://bit.ly/2IN0Dx4), which was from October 5-9. It was to charter a course to effectively use AI for social empowerment, inclusion, and transformation in key sectors such as health care, agriculture, finance, education and smart mobility.

Start-up disruptions

This focus on celebrating innovation has led to several start-ups disrupting the Indian market. The recent winners of the ‘Digital India AatmaNirbhar Bharat Innovate Challenge’ (https://bit.ly/3jer2QV) Chingari with its video communication tools and MapMyIndia with its elaborative maps, ‘Logically’, with its news delivery features are becoming household names. Furthermore, Setu, true to its name, is building a bridge to bring banks to people. It has built an application programming interface which allows customers to make small ticket payments without going to the bank. Yelo is offering neo-banking payment and money transfer services online for workers in the gig economy. Niramai (or Non-Invasive Risk Assessment with Machine Intelligence) uses an AI-based thermal imaging portable tool that carries out non-invasive breast cancer screening for women for early detection. This intervention is of great importance as an estimate suggests that one in two affected women in India die due to late detection. Qure.ai uses AI for health-care diagnostics in rural India, tackling challenges such as tuberculosis and now COVID-19. Gramophone offers pricing information from mandis, advice on soil and crop health and access to agricultural inputs via micro-entrepreneurs to farmers in Madhya Pradesh, aiding their operation efficiency. Vernacular.ai offers a voice-based AI product that can understand up to 10 Indian languages and around 160 dialects. It is helping build virtual, smart, responsive and effective chat assistants suitable for diverse Indian consumers.

Many incentives

Innovation needs risk capital in terms of resources and psychological security for researchers. It needs an environment where it is safe to fail. The government has been building a comprehensive framework to this end. It is incentivising research and development with several schemes such as Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) scholarships, the Ramanujan Fellowship, the Knowledge Involvement in Research Advancement through Nurturing (KIRAN) scheme, Smart India Hackathons (SIH), Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), the Biotechnology Ignition Grant (BIG) scheme, setting up of the Future Skills PRIME (Programme for Reskilling/Upskilling of IT Manpower for Employability) capacity building platform and also the triad of Scheme for Transformational and Advanced Research in Sciences (STARS), Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC) and Impactful Policy Research in Social Science (IMPRESS). The National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems aims to ‘catalyse translational research across “Al, IoT or the Internet of Things, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Big Data Analytics, Robotics, Quantum Computing, Data Science”.

Furthermore, the government has been actively facilitating collaborative and light touch regulatory practices to promote innovation and incentivise risk-taking. It has increasingly relied on collaboration, communication and creativity, taking the route of standard and principles adherence. The Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India allow for regulatory sandboxes for piloting new ideas. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has recently introduced recommendations for regulating cloud services in India, suggesting a light-touch regulation in collaboration with industry, balancing commercial freedom and principles adherence.

A better life

Walter Isaacson once cited this: “Advances in science when put to practical use mean more jobs, higher wages, shorter hours, more abundant crops, more leisure for recreation, for study, for learning how to live without deadening drudgery which has been the burden of the common man for past ages.” Innovation has the potential to build a future where AI will transform education and health care, machine learning and blockchain will make commerce robust and resilient, clean energy will drive our economy, gene-drives would exterminate invasive and harmful species, gene-editing would help us bring back extinct species and reinvigorate depleted ecosystems, quantum computing will raise our processing capability to resolve challenges which seem insurmountable and augmented, and virtual reality will optimistically change the way we interact with the physical world.

Steam engines made us understand thermodynamics, flights made us understand aerodynamics. There is ‘in-deed’ merit in relentless focus on innovation as it essentially augments ease of living for citizens, dematerialising and democratising products and services.

347,2020/10/21,The triumph of hope: On Jacinda Ardern's election victory,"Inclusive politics and decisive governance won another term for Ardern in New Zealand

Jacinda Ardern was expected to win Saturday’s parliamentary election in New Zealand given that almost all opinion polls had predicted this for the 40-year-old global liberal icon, noted for her inclusive politics and tough handling of the coronavirus pandemic. But it was the margin of the victory that surprised many. Her centre-left Labour Party won 49.1% of the popular vote and is projected to take 64 seats in the 120-member Parliament. This is Labour’s greatest victory in almost 50 years and the biggest victory of any party since the nation adopted a proportional representation voting system, which gives assembly seats to any party winning more than 5% vote, in 1996. The Opposition centre-right National Party won 26.8% of the vote and is projected to take 35 seats, down from the 56 seats it won in the previous election. Ms. Ardern, who came to power in 2017 by forming a coalition with the Greens and the nationalist New Zealand First party, faced unprecedented challenges in her first term, from the Christchurch terrorist attack and the White Island volcanic eruption to the COVID-19 outbreak. She herself had turned the polls into a de facto referendum on her government’s handling of the pandemic by calling it the ‘COVID election”. New Zealand, home to over five million, recorded just 25 pandemic deaths — one of the lowest fatality rates in the world. It has eliminated community transmission by imposing strict lockdowns and brought back relative normalcy before the election.

What makes Ms. Ardern’s victory significant is that her brand of politics — socially liberal, economically inclusive and politically democratic — has bucked the trend of conservatives and the anti-immigrant, anti-minority far-right parties making gains in crisis-ridden societies. Offering a new way of governance, she presented herself as an empathetic co-citizen who happens to be running the government. This approach was successfully tested when a far-right terrorist opened fire at two mosques in Christchurch in March 2019, killing 51. She immediately reached out to the country’s Muslim minority and backed a Bill that banned most assault style weapons. She has also promised to alleviate child poverty and fight climate change more vigorously. Inclusive politics and a humane approach, coupled with quick decisive actions to tackle crises, transformed her into the most popular New Zealand leader. But the emphatic victory also means great expectations. The lockdowns have had a heavy economic cost — a contraction by 12.2% in April-June. One of the criticisms she faced during the campaign was that she did not have a recovery plan. The COVID-19 threat is still looming large. She will have to prove her critics wrong and live up to the expectations of those who supported her while ruling for, what she said, “all New Zealanders”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-triumph-of-hope-on-jacinda-arderns-election-victory/article32903618.ece
348,2020/10/21,Heckler’s veto: On Vijay Sethupathi's withdrawal from Muralitharan biopic '800',"Films can be subjected to criticism after their release, but not stymied before they are made

Opposition from sections of Tamils has led to versatile Tamil film star Vijay Sethupathi withdrawing from a planned biopic on the Sri Lankan bowling legend, Muttiah Muralitharan. Opponents mainly from the Tamil film industry and political parties in Tamil Nadu claim that Muralitharan had “whitewashed genocide” by not raising his voice against the Sri Lankan state, and warned the actor against playing his character, contending that he would only jeopardise his career and alienate his fan following. It is a shame that these protests have prevented a talented actor from essaying a role based on the story of Muralitharan, who scaled Himalayan peaks in international cricket through talent and determination. Noting the unfair and unrelenting attacks on Sethupathi to the point of accusing him of being a traitor, Muralitharan appealed to the actor to keep out of the biopic. The ultimate decision may have been Muralitharan’s own, but it is quite clear that Sethupathi dropped the idea only after the onslaught. The film’s motion poster released recently had evoked great expectation among cinema aficionados, especially because of the actor’s highly convincing resemblance to the cricketer. Appropriately named ‘800’, in celebration of the number of Test wickets the bewitching off-spinner bagged, the biopic appears to aim at showcasing his rise in the backdrop of the violent ethnic conflict that shook Sri Lanka for three decades.

Exponents of art being cowed down by protests is not new to Tamil Nadu. The real problem in the latest example of popular intolerance prevailing over artistic ventures is that an old chestnut in Tamil Nadu politics — the idea that every Tamil should pass a ‘Tamil nationalist’ test — has been resurrected to stymie this project too. Madras Cafe, a Hindi film, could not be screened in the State after opposition to its portrayal of the LTTE. In 2008, a Sri Lankan producer was forced to give up his footage while he was in Chennai to process his film at a studio. Some of those who demanded that Sethupathi withdraw from the biopic have emphasised that they were merely making an appeal to him, given his past political views in favour of causes that resonate with the people of Tamil Nadu. Whether it was an appeal or a threat, it is a no-brainer that pressure was brought to bear on an artist to give up his professional decision. As for Muralitharan’s political views, it may be that some of his remarks were seen as supporting the Sri Lankan Army’s triumph over the LTTE and questioning the truth behind the grief of the mothers of the disappeared thousands. However, that is no reason to run down his monumental achievements in his chosen sport. And nothing prevents any detractor from questioning the film’s motive or content after its release. It is unfortunate that the heckler’s veto has prevailed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hecklers-veto-on-vijay-sethupathis-withdrawal-from-muralitharan-biopic-800/article32903616.ece

Nitin Mittal, who weighed 130 kg, suffered from cirrhosis of the liver. He was registered in a hospital in Delhi for liver transplant and was undergoing treatment. During this period his kidney function deteriorated and he was put on dialysis.

He had visited Gleneagles Global Health City in Chennai and consulted Joy Varghese, director of hepatology and transplant hepatology.

Mr. Mittal’s wife wanted to donate a kidney and he was registered for cadaver liver transplant. When tests revealed that she was pregnant the doctors put Mr. Mittal on medication and sent him back to Delhi.

However, his condition began to deteriorate. His blood count fell to below five (normally it should be between 12 and 17). His kidney disease caused further complications. Within a year he had undergone over 40 blood transfusions. He was admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital in Delhi and his cardiac function was 30% lower than normal. He lost consciousness.

The family became apprehensive and contacted the GGHC liver team for second opinion. On their advice, he was transported by air ambulance to Chennai nearly two months ago.

Investigations at GGHC revealed that he had fungal growth in blood. He was admitted to the specialised liver ICU for a fortnight and put on round-the-clock dialysis for 3-4 days.

His sister came forward to donate a portion of her liver. “The transplant surgery took 14 hours. The patient was discharged on the 16th day post-surgery,” Dr. Varghese said.

“A dedicated team of critical care specialists and nurses made sure that the patient and both the donors remained safe from COVID infection”, said Selvakumar Malleeswaran, head of liver ICU.

“We faced a big challenge in performing dialysis for the patient with such low BP and had to perform continuous renal replacement therapy before and during the surgery,” said K. Muruganandham, senior consultant, urology and renal transplantation surgeon.

The kidney was retrieved through keyhole surgery. “The kidney started producing urine immediately after implantation. The positivity of the donors and recipient aided in their quick and smooth recovery” said P. Muthukumar, senior consultant, nephrology and renal transplant physician.

Mr. Mittal would be on immuno suppresants and would be periodically evaluated, the doctors said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cxi9ui/article31371148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JOYVARGHESE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/delhi-man-undergoes-live-donor-liver-and-kidney-transplant/article32907541.ece

Police sources claimed the incident occurred on Sunday morning.

The former High Court judge went with four people to an apartment in Kalakshetra Colony where retired Supreme Court judge R. Banumathi stayed with her daughter.

The complainant Devaraj, a security guard of the apartment, alleged that one of them introduced himself as a judge, and told him that he wanted to meet the person residing in a house on the first floor of the apartment.

When the guard refused to allow them stating that no one was was residing in the house, they banged the front door and hurled abuses. After being alerted by the security guard, a police patrol team reached the spot and asked them to disperse.

On a complaint from the security guard, the Tiruvanmiyur Police recorded the FIR against them under Sections 294(b) (obscene language) and 448 (trespassing)of IPC, a police officer said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/five-booked-for-creating-ruckus-outside-justice-retdbanumathis-residence/article32906417.ece
358,2020/10/21,Cracking down on drunk driving even while maintaining distance,"To avoid physical contact while checking drunk driving cases, the traffic policemen of Chennai are asking motorists to walk over to breathalysers mounted on the patrol vehicles and blow into them.

With 454 Chennai traffic police personnel testing positive for COVID-19 till date, personnel are taking every possible precaution to prevent getting infected.

To avoid physical contact while checking drunk driving cases, the traffic policemen are asking motorists to walk over to breathalysers mounted on the patrol vehicles and blow into them.

So far 454 of around 3,000 traffic policemen have tested positive. Of this, 411 have rejoined duty while 35 are under home quarantine, five in care centres and three in hospitals.

Since the cases were reported in the city and Tasmac shops were closed, the traffic police stopped using breathalysers to check fior nebriated motorists.

Increase in cases

With the reopening of Tasmac shops, the police have also started cracking down on drunken driving.

“We are now seeing an increase in drunken driving. But we do not want to risk the lives of motorists or police personnel. So we are asking motorists to pick the straw and blow into the breathalyser. If the reading is high, we seize the vehicle, sanitise it and then ask them to collect it the next day,” said S.R. Senthil, Deputy Commissioner, Traffic (East).

C. Raja, inspector, Nungambakkam traffic police, said now motorists were produced before virtual courts, and they could pay the fine of ₹10,000.

“Everything is contactless now. It keeps us and the motorists safe,” he said.

A senior traffic police officer said personnel with comorbidities were being given office jobs.

“Generally we do not deploy them on roads. We have also been provided protective gear, such as masks, hoods, gloves and hand sanitisers,” the officer said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nb5pp1/article32904524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20OCTTHMOUNTED-BREAHT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cracking-down-on-drunk-driving-even-while-maintaining-distance/article32904525.ece

An official of the College said transpersons were being given admission since 2010. Transpersons were among the target group for the community radio that the institution runs.

The college is in the process of creating a corpus so that more transpersons could gain admission to the institution.

Sudha T.G., an activist, who has been fighting for the cause of transpersons, recalled that when K. Baskar was the Vice-Chancellor of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University he introduced a scheme by which transpersons were given free education.

361,2020/10/21,Onions sell for ₹90 a kg in Koyambedu wholesale market,"Crop damage due to heavy rain has led to a fall in supply

As onion supply to the city remains scanty, the price of 1 kg of the vegetable touched ₹90 in the Koyambedu wholesale market on Tuesday. It will take at least two months for the prices to drop and this will happen only after the arrival of fresh harvest, traders noted.

Heavy rain in onion producing States and crop damage had led to a supply crunch. While the cost of most vegetables is relatively stable, onions and carrots have been priced high at the wholesale market.

Onion arrivals to Koyambedu dipped to 35-40 truckloads on Tuesday from the daily average of 70-80.

Wholesalers noted that the price of onion varied from ₹40 to ₹90 per kg, depending on the quality. Small onions sold for up to ₹110 per kg.

Onions from Maharashtra contribute 45%-50% of the supply to the city, while the rest comes from Telangana and Karnataka.

However, heavy rain and labour shortage during the harvest had resulted in a dip in production.

P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants’ Association, said, “The arrivals of small onions has also reduced by half. Carrots cost up to ₹100 a kg as rain in the Nilgiris has destroyed the crops. We may have to wait till mid-December for onion prices to come down.”

In a measure similar to last year, when the price of onions peaked to ₹140 per kg in December, wholesale traders have started sourcing onions from Egypt and a few truck loads trickled into the market this week.

John Valtharis, president, Koyambedu Onion Wholesale Traders’ Association, said, “It will take a fortnight for more onions imported from Egypt to arrive from Mumbai port to Chennai. Egyptian onions are sold for ₹50-₹60 per kg. Some traders are also sourcing the produce from countries like Iran and Afghanistan.”

Wholesalers suggested that the government should explore the open ventilated warehousing model used to store onions in Brazil and Israel to prevent such recurring price hikes.

Preventing hoarding

As an effort to prevent hoarding, officials of the Koyambedu Market Management Committee have started conducting frequent checks since Monday. Officials noted that hoarding had not been observed so far.

Meanwhile, the Cooperative Department will start selling onions at a subsidised price of ₹45 per kg in its 29 Farm Fresh outlets across the city, starting Wednesday.

An official said, “Onions will be available in the 65 outlets across the State from Thursday. Initially, we will be procuring 10 tonnes of onions from Nashik through the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/oqii2/article32904312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20OCTTHONION-SALE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/onions-sell-for-90-a-kg-in-wholesale-market/article32904313.ece
362,2020/10/21,"As roads get busy, Chennai traffic police personnel back on their toes","With the city on the fast track to normalcy, measures for road safety are back on the table after an uneventful lockdown between March and September

The traffic police heaved a sigh of relief after accidents and rash driving dropped during the lockdown period between March and September.

Since the start of September, after public transport resumed, they are back on their toes to ensure safety on the roads even as full-fledged vehicular movement is yet to resume. On top of this, they also have an additional job on hand — creating awareness about COVID-19 among the motorists.

According to statistics provided by the traffic police, between March 24 and September 5, road accident deaths dropped by over 50% and the number of related injuries decreased by 63% compared to the corresponding period last year. However, fatalities and injuries between September and October 2020 are nearly the same compared to 2019.

“During the lockdown, there were no buses or autorickshaws and the vehicle population was less than half compared with normal days. The accidents then were mainly injuries caused by people falling from bikes or cycles, cases of speeding and accidents involving emergency vehicles. After the lockdown was lifted, traffic is slowly returning to normal,” said N. Kannan, Additional Commissioner of Police, Traffic.

“Traffic is yet to resume fully as many schools, colleges and IT offices are still closed. Even MTC buses are not fully operational. But there are many two-wheelers and cars on the road. Early last month, there was a lot of rash driving as people got used to empty roads, now even that is on the wane as traffic density is increasing,” a senior police officer said.

The police said they had identified close to 200 blackspots in the city based on the number of fatalities. “If many accidents happen in the same spot over many years, it will be our first priority spot. We are studying the reason, including faults in road design, and we will take steps to resolve the issue,” Mr. Kannan said.

Police officers said enforcement was being made stricter. “Till now people were driving without helmets. We have started stopping those without helmets, those speeding and those driving after drinking. In the city’s periphery, we have placed barricades and checkposts to deter speeding.”

‘Adopting’ roads

The police have also started “adopting” roads, to facilitate smooth flow of traffic. “We are adopting roads which are congested and removing encroachments.”

“This will ensure free flow of traffic as the stretch will become wider, and accidents will also be prevented,” said a senior police officer. Each police station will adopt one stretch for improvement.

“If there is a black spot on the stretch, then they will devote more attention,” the officer added.

Though the traffic police are cracking down on speeding and traffic offences, they are more focused on contactless enforcement to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“Since CCTV cameras were introduced, we track the speeding vehicle’s registration number and send a challan to the owner’s house. We are also going to introduce more automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras in many arterial stretches soon. So we do not have to stop a motorist when he commits an offence,” a senior police officer said.

Many traffic policemen feel that they now have an additional role to play. “Apart from handling traffic violations and regulating traffic, we are also creating COVID-19 awareness at traffic signals. We check for people not wearing masks and advise them to wear it or provide them with one,” a traffic inspector on Poonamallee High Road said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/lcovy3/article32528054.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ChennaiCITYStG7L7O1MDC3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/as-roads-get-busy-traffic-police-personnel-back-on-their-toes/article32904861.ece
363,2020/10/21,IIT-Madras to train students in high-performance computing,"It is a nodal centre under National Supercomputing Mission

The Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-M), will train students in high-performance computing (HPC) soon. The institute has been made the nodal centre for training under the National Supercomputing Mission (NSM).

The centre will train scientists and engineers, and create manpower capable of conducting research in artificial intelligence (AI).

Recently, the institute signed an agreement with the Pune-based Centre for Development of Advanced Computing.

Rupesh Nasre, a faculty in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, said the aim was to build infrastructure, develop applications, focus on research and create a human resource pool.

“Certain institutes were given different clusters of varied capacity to improve the overall infrastructure within the country. The aim is to train and create a set of personnel, including HPC programmers, users or system administrators, besides developing applications,” he said.

Need for ground

“HPC is not prevalent in India. We need to develop ground up by floating certain curriculum courses as part of B. Tech or even B. Sc. For this, you need basic computing infrastructure, which is a little high-end compared to our laptops and desktops,” he added.

As of now, only the older IITs have high-performing computers. These are a cluster of computers that are inter-connected and allow for several operations to be performed simultaneously.

The recent MoU and the resultant training would provide for HPCs in the newer IITs as well, Mr. Nasre said.

At IIT-M, there are students who have domain knowledge, but do not know how to compute. There are also those who know computing, but don’t have domain knowledge, he said.

The institute has developed a mobile phone application that students can download. There are also YouTube videos from where they can learn HPC, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/1fnp03/article32904541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10TH-LT-INDIANINSTITUTEOFTECHNOLOGY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/iit-madras-to-train-students-in-high-performance-computing/article32904542.ece
364,2020/10/21,Coronavirus | Doctors voice concern over the long-term effects of COVID-19,"Apollo Hospitals launches post-COVID recovery clinics

At the launch of post-COVID recovery clinics, doctors flagged concerns on long-term persistent effects of the disease and the need for continuum of care for patients.

From persistent fatigue to breathlessness, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, scarring of lungs, risk of blood clots and cardiac manifestations, doctors are seeing patients, who have recovered from COVID-19, with many such symptoms.

“We are 10 months into the pandemic. When it began, there was a lot of panic. The panic is still present. We thought all people are susceptible, with the elderly and those with comorbidities at a high risk for complications. So, the initial response was on how to stay protected. People were told to go to hospitals early if they developed the infection. We are realising that it does not end there. Persons who have recovered are running into a lot of problems,” V. Ramasubramanian, senior consultant, Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospitals, said on Tuesday as the Apollo Hospitals Group launched post-COVID recovery clinics across its network.

COVID-19, he said, was not only a respiratory illness but also a systemic disease affecting all organs, predominantly the lungs. “Some of the commonest symptoms are tiredness, mild breathlessness, joint pain, dryness in mouth, problems with appetite and sleeplessness. Persons who did not require hospitalisation for COVID-19 are experiencing such symptoms,” he added.

Scarring in lungs and blood clots are other possibilities, while psychological effects due to isolation and stigmatisation are being felt.

“Some have neurological problems such as mind fog or brain fog. Some of my colleagues cannot use cell phones to send messages. They find the letters blurred on electronic devices. We realised that COVID-19 affects all organs. There are long haulers with persistent fatigue, breathlessness even with an oxygen saturation of 98 to 99. This is called autonomic abnormality. We need to tackle this, for which a comprehensive multidisciplinary unit is required,” Dr. Ramasubramanian explained.

On the effects of COVID-19 on the heart, Dr. Ramasubramanian said there was an increased risk of blood clots forming in blood vessels due to inflammation. “Studies have shown that the heart function is temporarily damaged during COVID-19. There could be problems in heart function, contraction, blood flow and rhythm disturbances. There is an increased risk of sudden death after weeks,” he said.

L. Sundararajan, senior consultant pulmonologist, said 80% of patients recover well. “Even among them, some have long lasting effects of COVID-19 on almost all organs,” he said.

In the outpatient department, doctors were seeing patients three to four months later with scarring of lungs and symptoms of breathlessness with minimal exertion, he pointed out.

Referring to long COVID-19 syndrome, he added that it might take weeks or months for a patient to make a full recovery, raising the need for a platform such as a recovery clinic to make a complete assessment of patients. At least 50% of persons have symptoms, D. Suresh Kumar, senior consultant, Infectious Diseases, added. He recalled how a young person complained of hair loss after suffering from COVID-19.

While the elderly had symptoms of fatigue, problems in appetite and giddiness, the young had symptoms such as anxiety and lack of sleep.

366,2020/10/21,"Offset dilution in defence, a flawed policy turn","As an episode in India’s aerospace industry shows, it can succeed if it is designed and executed correctly

Recently, the government diluted the “offset” policy in defence procurement, reportedly in response to a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India’s report tabled in Parliament last month. Many contend that the move is a setback for augmenting domestic capabilities or for realising the goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat. But why is it a setback for the goals under Atmanirbhar Bharat? The experience with the procedure in the aerospace industry since 2005 seems to offer useful lessons in redesigning defence offsets.

What is an offset policy? And how is it expected to boost domestic capabilities? What lessons can we draw from a similar system in the aerospace industry? These questions are addressed below.

Offset ties up the ends

Most countries restrict trade in defence equipment and advanced technologies in order to safeguard national interest. Yet, for commercial gains and for global technological recognition, governments and firms do like to expand the trade. Negotiated bilateral sales between countries are a way out of the dilemma. Soft credit often sweetens the deals, with restrictions imposed on use, modification and resale of such equipment and technologies, to protect the proprietary knowledge and expertise embedded in them.

In such trade negotiations, the price of the product is one of the many other factors. Geopolitics and the technical knowhow involved in the equipment weigh-in considerably since the contracts are for the long term, with technological fixities. The product and technology compel buyers to stick to them for: the advantages of bulk purchase, and dependence on the supplier for spares and upgrades. In other words, there is considerable “path dependency” in such choices, rendering the decisions difficult to reverse.

Also read: Two-year residual life of 56 Mi-17s after ₹223-crore upgrade untenable: CAG

Developing country buyers often lack an industrial base and research and development (R&D) facilities (which take a long time to mature). The price and the terms of the contract often reflect the government’s relative bargaining strength and also domestic political and economic considerations.

Large buyers such as India seek to exercise their “buying power” to secure not just the lowest price. They also try to acquire the technology to upgrade domestic production and build R&D capabilities. The offset clause — used globally — is the instrument for securing these goals.

A number of changes

Initiated in 2005, the offset clause has a requirement of sourcing 30% of the value of the contract domestically; indigenisation of production in a strict time frame, and training Indian professionals in high-tech skills, for promoting domestic R&D. However, the policy has been tweaked many times since.

Also read: IAF bought uncertified engines at inflated prices in 2010: CAG

As of November 2019, as in a reply to a parliamentary question, the Defence Ministry had signed 52 offset contracts worth $12 billion via Indian offset partners, or domestic firms. The duration of these contracts extends up to 2022.

According to the recent CAG report mentioned above, between 2007 and 2018, the government reportedly signed 46 offset contracts worth ₹66,427 crore of investments. However, the realised investments were merely 8%, or worth ₹5,457 crore. Reportedly, technology transfer agreements in the offsets were not implemented, failing to accomplish the stated policy objective. We are unable to verify the claim as the government has not put in place an automatic monitoring system for offset contracts, as initially promised.

On September 28, the government has diluted this policy further. Henceforth, the offset clause will not be applicable to bilateral deals and deals with a single (monopoly) seller, to begin with.

Setback for defence

Most defence deals are bilateral (as stated above), or a single supplier deal (given the monopoly over the technology). The dilution means practically giving up the offset clause, sounding the death knell of India’s prospects for boosting defence production and technological self-reliance. The government, however, has defended the decision by claiming a cost advantage. It is a lamentable excuse for the reported policy failure. Price is but one of many factors in such deals, as explained above. The higher (upfront) cost of the agreement due to the offset clause would pay for itself by: reducing costs in the long term by indigenisation of production and the potential technology spill-overs for domestic industry. Hence, giving up the offset clause is undoubtedly a severe setback.

Shortlived in aerospace

The offset policy can, however, succeed, if it is designed and executed correctly, as a parallel episode in aerospace industry demonstrates. Despite the heft of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, India is a lightweight in global civilian aircraft manufacturing, as the public sector giant mostly devotes itself to defence production. The much-touted National Civil Aircraft Development (NCAD) project — to come up with an indigenously designed Regional Transport Aircraft (RTA) — has remained a non-starter from day one.

However, with the introduction of the offset policy in 2005, things changed dramatically. For contracts valued at ₹300 crore or more, 30% of it will result in offsets, implemented through Indian offset partners. As aerospace imports rose rapidly, so did the exports via the offsets, by a whopping 544% in 2007, compared to the previous year. By 2014, exports increased to $6.7 billion from a paltry $62.5 million in 2005, according to the United Nations Comtrade Database. The offset clause enabled India to join the league of the world’s top 10 aerospace exporters; the only country without a major domestic aerospace firm. The success was short-lived, however. Exports plummeted after the offset clause was relaxed, primarily when the threshold for the policy was raised from the hitherto ₹300 crore to ₹2000 crore, in 2016. The offset exports fell to $1.5 billion by 2019. The 2005 policy helped promote a vibrant aerospace cluster, mostly micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) around Bengaluru. The policy dilution undid success. The moral of the story is there for everyone to see.

Aiding self-reliance

Reportedly because of the CAG’s critical remarks in its latest report tabled in the Parliament, the government has virtually scrapped the defence offset policy. Thus, India has voluntarily given up a powerful instrument of bargaining to acquire scarce advanced technology — a system that large and politically ambitious nations seek to exercise. There are successful examples to draw lessons from, as the aerospace industry episode demonstrates. India needs to re-conceive or re-imagine the offset clause in defence contracts with stricter enforcement of the deals, in national interest, and in order to aim for ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan’, or a self-reliant India.

367,2020/10/21,"Letters to the Editor — October 21, 2020","Have an inquiry

It is painful to read about allegations having been levelled against the seniormost puisne judge of the Supreme Court of India and who is next in line to the high office of the Chief Justice of India (CJI). One cannot allow these allegations and counter-allegations to simply be debated in public without seeking solutions. The only way is for the CJI to appoint a retired judge with outstanding credentials to conduct an inquiry into the allegations. It is needless to say that if there is no truth in the allegations, then action should follow against the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister.

India is going through challenging times and the independence of the judiciary which is essential to ensuring the stability of democracy in the country is at stake. The Supreme Court has to act immediately to restore public confidence in the judiciary.

N.G.R. Prasad, D. Nagasaila,

Chennai

The Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister’s letter to the CJI, and now in the public domain, is an odd move. Does it behove a Chief Minister’s stature to be casting aspersions on the integrity of judges in such a manner? Will this not only erode faith in the judiciary but also undermine its authority? That the issue is sought to be sensationalised is all the more disconcerting.

P.K. Varadarajan,

Chennai

If there is an ‘immunity’ for judges within the system, it is out of a sincere belief that judges will be above board, uphold the sacredness of jurisprudence and deliver impartial and unquestionable judgments.

In the case of the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister’s letter, one expects the Chief Justice of India to constitute a committee of retired judges with impeccable records to find out the truth within a short timeframe. The judge in question should submit himself before this committee for scrutiny.

CSK sliding

It is evident that CSK is a pale shadow of ‘The team’ that won in the past. While the bowling attack was quite good, the batsmen never scored enough runs. The decline of M.S. Dhoni as a batsman has hurt the team’s performance, and most of his gambles have failed. It would be unfortunate if he is literally shoved off the stage after performing so well in the past. Such is the fickleness of Indian spectators.

Anthony Henriques,

Mumbai

IPL 2020 has been the worst edition for CSK so far. There needs to be an overhaul. Stephen Fleming, MSD, Bravo, Watson have been fantastic over the years but they need to be realistic, So too Jadhav, Chawla and Vijay. You win some and lose some but the manner in which CSK has fallen and surrendered is shocking to say the least. CSK fans are disappointed, angry and hurt by the insipid performance.

368,2020/10/21,‘Comedy Couple’ movie review: Romcom let down by unimaginative writing,"The Saqib Saleem and Shweta Basu Prasad-starrer has a few laughs, but a weak script and the use of old tropes make it a painful watch

The closest match for Comedy Couple in food is Navratan Korma.

You have a male lead who is a habitual liar, the lead pair is billed as India’s first and only standup comedy couple, there is potential for a culture clash: the man’s parents are as traditional as they come while the girl’s single mother paints nude models in Paris. Oh, there is also the familiar tale of a boy and girl in love thrown into the mix.

Except, there are too many cooks who seem to have handled this korma that when you are done watching Comedy Couple, it is hard not to think: maybe, a simple dal could have done the trick.

‘Comedy Couple’ details Cast: Saqib Saleem, Shweta Basu Prasad, Rajesh Tailang, Aadar Malik, Pranay Manchanda, Pooja Bedi

Saqib Saleem, Shweta Basu Prasad, Rajesh Tailang, Aadar Malik, Pranay Manchanda, Pooja Bedi Director: Nachiket Samant

Nachiket Samant Storyline: Lies, deceit, broken hearts and a complicated relationship: a romcom story about a standup comedy couple.

Comedy Couple follows the story of Deep Sharma (Saqib) and Zoya Batra (Shweta); the gags and jokes aren’t exactly unimaginative, but the benefit of hindsight does make one think if the standup act itself was irrelevant to the storyline. Deep and Zoya could well have been doctors or trapeze artists in the Great Bombay Circus, it wouldn’t have made a difference to the tried-and-tested formulaic storyline adopted by Nachiket.

Deep is a software engineer, but he quit his job to try his hand in stand-up comedy after falling for Zoya. They are in a live-in relationship but the conservative society they live in keeps bumping them around. However, Deep lies about all of it to his parents fearing blowback due to their conservative nature. His habitual lying causes more than its share of rifts in the duo’s lives. Whether or not they patch up and get back — as is the case with romcoms — forms the rest of the story.

Saqib and Shweta exhibit the type of chemistry that is often missing in romcoms. What’s remarkable is that the duo could find the sync so seamlessly despite shooting the film in the aftermath of COVID-19 lockdowns. Shweta is the more composed act of the two; Saqib appears to push harder but falls just short of being convincing in the various acts: love, lies, desperation and despair.

There is very little of note to speak about the film’s cinematography and editing. But considering how post-pandemic movies are going to depend massively on the writing team’s nous, to make it or break it, Comedy Couple’s screenwriters seem to have let it down massively.

There are the occasional funny bits involving Deep’s father (Rajesh Tailang) and his friend Rohan (Aadar), but this romcom could have been so much more fun, had the Korma cooks focussed on one of the many ingredients, and then spinning the ideas of love, relationship and despair around it. Due credit for including a superficial take on ‘Gau Mutra’ politics but one would rather watch Kunal Kamra for an unhinged take on the same topic.

Deep Sharma’s lies — deliberate, innocent or the evil type — could have produced more slapstick humour, that is if the writers thought of pushing Saqib Saleem in the direction that he had to be. Putting Rajesh Tailang and Pooja Bedi in the same room too would have produced more ‘comedy’ than what the lead pair achieve on the fictional stage in the film.

There was a time in the ‘90s when romcoms were just normal; every other week would see a project in that genre arrive at the box office. It is no more the case, but even for nostalgia value, it makes sense for writers to pay more attention and compile something that ticks the boxes for the millennial crowd. It is any day better than depending on the same old tropes, and hope against hope that a new lead pair and an unoriginal idea for characterisation could somehow help them hit the jackpot.

369,2020/10/21,Bonding over barbecue,"Gardens and balconies have become the centre of activity, as families are discovering the joys of barbecuing

There is something meditative about sitting with people who matter and watching food slowly sizzle; especially in these times, when our social lives have shrunk suddenly and painfully.

With social distancing in place, cities under successive lockdowns since March, WFH and cooler weather, COVID-19 has inadvertently revived old-fashioned family bonding over barbecues in the garden or on small balconies.

“What started as a trial has evolved into a weekend ritual,” says Dhruv Ramachandran, a Law student in Delhi, who has been home in Chennai since the virus outbreak. With time on hand, Dhruv decided to experiment with the barbecue set his father ordered online. He cooks with his dad —a barbecue enthusiast — and the duo has tried out Iranian kebabs and Peshawari grills among a host of other recipes using chicken, mutton and seafood. For Dhruv, the process is more about spending quality time with family on the verandah in his backyard. Delicious food is a bonus.

A lot of Indians have been setting up grills at home over the past few years. The equipment, charcoal, accessories, meat and marinade can be bought online. “You learn how to marinate the meat, ignite the coal, and cook the meat… all through trial and error,” says Sayan Majumdar, a manager working with an MNC in Kolkata, who took to grilling during the lockdown, experimenting with what he has learnt from watching American barbecue shows. “For humid Kolkata weather, evenings are the only good time to do this though,” says Sayan, who has his grill on the balcony.

“I learnt the technique of brining, which is immersing the meat in water infused with salt, brown sugar, herbs, chilli flakes and sometimes, vinegar. The meat soaks in the flavours and works well,” he says.

Wood works The type of wood added to the coal embers in a barbecue enhances the flavour of the meat. Apple, cherry, maple and mesquite wood are the most sought-after. Since trees such as maple and mesquite are not available in India, barbecue enthusiasts source it through friends. Some get creative, using wood of native fruit trees and even chicory, for their distinctive flavours.

Ever since the lockdown, Shaun George Joseph says his Kochi-based brand Pepe Bbq, has seen a spike in sales. “I’ve been getting a lot of queries about smaller barbecue grills,” he says, adding that this period has been more productive than he expected. He asked a vendor to make stainless steel equipment and now has a range that starts at ₹800 and goes up to ₹5,000. Shaun says his customer profile has become more varied. “I used to get younger people — picnickers and college students. Recently, two elderly neighbours, who have been playing cards since the lockdown, came here looking for a grill as they wanted to add some barbecuing to their game nights,” says Shaun.

For lockdown grillers, it is a DIY food adventure. But barbecuing extracts a certain amount of commitment, says Sampurna Gupta Chatterjee, a Delhi-based lawyer whose barbecues are a yearly calendar event for her friends. Every New Year’s eve, she hosts a barbecue on her apartment terrace. “It requires a lot of patience as you need to watch over the meat as it cooks slowly. It is not like you can toss the meat on the grill and forget all about it,” she says. Igniting the coal is the crucial part, and then comes maintaining the temperature, all the while checking on the meat. “Doing a barbecue in Delhi winter itself is a challenge, but that is the fun of it,” says Sampurna.

Purists point out that barbecuing is often confused with grilling. While the former is smoking the meat in indirect hot air, the latter is cooking the meat on direct heat, says Bengaluru-based Roy Abraham Varghese, a marketing communications professional, who has been barbecuing for the past 15 years. Pitmaster Roy says he learnt the fine art through sheer practice.

“It is a vast area. One needs to understand the meats and the cuts. The wood added to the coal embers brings out the entire flavour profile of the meat,” he says. While Roy picks pork butt as his favourite, fillet mignon and tomahawk are his pieces de resistance. He helps those starting out with basic techniques and tricks. Roy’s weekends are devoted to barbecue, and the lockdown gave more time to explore his passion.

While sourcing good meat is a problem in India, pitmasters have found their way around the challenge. Joel Rebbi from Kochi showed his butcher YouTube videos of the specific cuts he wanted. Days of trial and error later, he got the butcher to deliver the right cut. The quality of the meat may not match up to international standards, but to make a brisket in spite of the constraints is rewarding, says Joel, who devoted four years just to master the brisket. “Initially, it felt like chewing on bark, but now it melts in the mouth,” he says. Beef, he adds, is one of the most difficult meats to barbecue.

“It isn’t only about mulling over meat; why not some beet?” asks Bijal Hindocha, a homemaker from Chennai, who says vegetables such as zucchini, broccoli, carrots and beetroot work very well in a barbecue. . “Let’s think beyond potato and paneer. A char-grilled zucchini tastes just as wonderful. So also, broccoli” says Bijal, who tried grilling beetroot recently. Her malai broccoli is a family favourite. Indian spices work very well, she adds. Bijal flavours the oil with spices before grilling the vegetables and says it is a great way to enhance the flavour. For vegetatrians, eggplant, onions, bell peppers and mushrooms are other options.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/7tlutn/article32909417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kimpveggrilljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/barbecue-season-is-on-and-families-are-bonding-over-food/article32909419.ece
370,2020/10/21,Chennai food entrepreneurs upgrade familiar staples to make meal planning easier,"As lockdowns brought the focus back to home pantries, entrepreneurs began upgrading familiar staples to make it easier to put together quick, tasty meals

Tempeh Chennai

“I am a very bad cook,” laughs Samta Rohira disarmingly. Fortunately, for the many fans of her soybean and chickpea tempeh, that did not deter her from experimenting to find ways to make and supply the nutrient-dense, fermented food in Chennai. Sought for its unique flavour, tempeh is tough to find in the city since it is relatively unfamiliar. However, this savoury alternative to meat, a traditional staple in Indonesia, is getting increasingly popular especially with vegans and vegetarians.

“My mom was born in Surabaya, so we travel to Indonesia every year,” says Samta. “We used to spend our summer holidays there, for two months a year when I was growing up.” Her family was based in Chennai, where she grew up before moving to Jakarta to work for five years after graduating from Ethiraj College for Women. “Then I got married and landed back in Chennai,” she says.

Once the lockdowns began, she began to miss Indonesian food. “I could not travel this year. I began to wonder, ‘how can I bring my staple food to the city?’” The experiments began in March, and she was ready to launch by September. “I have to follow certain processes to adjust to the temperature here,” she says, adding that she makes tempeh twice a week, and each batch takes about three days. “Whatever I make gets sold out.”

To make meal planning easier, she also makes a chilli garlic sambal. “People buy both together — so you can put together a meal in minutes,” says Samta, adding, “I eat like this all the time: steamed rice, sambal, pan fried tempeh and veggies on the side.”

Let’s Spread It

Roshan Thadani understands the importance of high quality staples. While COVID-19 triggered the rise of cloud kitchens with elaborate menus, encouraging customers to order indulgent meals, he launched with a jar of mayonnaise.

After graduating with a degree in Hotel Management, Roshan worked with The Bombay Canteen and city-based Writer’s Cafe, learning the nuances of being both a line cook as well as a restaurant manager. When the lockdowns began, he started to work on creating a whole egg mayonnaise made with no added preservatives, thickeners, emulsifiers, flavourings or colour.

With a satisfying homemade flavour, the classic (made with mustard, vinegar and olive oil) is well balanced, with the acidity of the vinegar cutting through its creamy richness. There is a Chillinaise, its colour and flavours deepened with freshly made chilli garlic sauce. And a compellingly garlicky aioli, his most popular blend.

While homemade mayonnaise has a much shorter shelf life than the store-bought versions (Roshan suggests you consume it in 15 days), it has an appealing clarity of flavour unmuddied by the clutch of preservatives that go into mass produced jars. The classic works well with salads: quickly chop onions, cucumbers and tomatoes, then swathe them in a large dollop of it. The chilli version adds a kick to sandwiches.

And you are quite likely to find yourself shamefacedly working your way through the aioli, armed with just a bag of crisps, and a spoon.

Ricky’s Cookie

Just before lockdown, in March, Karthikeyan Jagganathan launched lemon pockets, a cookie fusing fresh lemon, cream cheese and caramelised white chocolate. His brand, Ricky’s Cookie, which he runs with his wife Poorani Ramakrishnan, was turning a year old and already drawing a following for its adventurous flavours highlighting unexpected ingredients like chironji nuts, rhubarb and red rice.

However, with the ongoing pandemic, Ricky’s Cookie — like many other businesses — floundered. “I was all set to open a cafe space. Thank goodness we did not do it,” says Karthikeyan, who quit his job as a systems engineer at TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) to follow his dream, and join Ferrandi, a culinary school in Paris. After a year at school, he did a string of internships at prestigious French restaurants, including Chef Alain Passard’s influential L’Arpège.

As the festive season approaches, Karthikeyan is determined to inject an air of celebration into what has been a grim year. And he is doing it with an indulgent super-sized cookie.

With a diameter of seven inches, the cookie is chunky with dark chocolate from Auroville’s Mason and Co. (Mason and Co. executes every step, from bean to bar, resulting in a product that has personality and terroir-influenced nuances.) The cookies, studded with roasted pecans, are rich and buttery, but not overwhelmingly sweet.

“We did not want to call it a monster cookie, which is a popular term for this size in America,” says Karthikeyan. “We wanted it to be a gift. A way to cheer someone up. So we call it our celebration cookie.”

371,2020/10/21,Gutkha racket: main accused arrested,"Caught at Mumbai airport as he was trying to flee to Bhubaneshwar

The Anti Narcotics Cell of the Navi Mumbai police have arrested Pramod Das alias Kalu (35), the main accused in a gutkha racket, from the Mumbai airport as he was trying to flee to Bhubaneshwar.

“Kalu ordered the stock from Gujarat and supplied it in Mumbai,” senior police inspector Ravindra Budhwant said.

On October 9, four people were arrested — Jitendra Karthikchandra Das (26), Priyavrat Abhaykumar Das (29), Munna Shrijanardhan Yadav (28) and Akheya Budhadev Khonda (22) — with gutkha worth ₹35.53 lakh from Rabale MIDC.

The next day, Mumtaz Ahmad Nafis Ahmad Shah (33), who runs a paan shop at Khairane, was arrested and gutkha worth ₹5.3 lakh was seized. On October 13, Lakshminarayan Budhan Jha (35) was arrested from Vichumbe in Panvel and gutkha worth ₹4.2 lakh was seized.

372,2020/10/21,Maharashtra withdraws general consent to CBI,"Third State after West Bengal and Rajasthan to take such an action

The Maharashtra government on Wednesday withdrew its general consent to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), curtailing its powers in the State.

The CBI will now have to approach the State government on a case to case basis, seeking permission to conduct investigations. Maharashtra is the third State after West Bengal and Rajasthan to take such an action.

The move comes a day after the CBI registered an FIR in the TRP scam, allegedly involving Republic TV. The Mumbai Police, which registered the case on October 8, was conducting a probe into the matter.

373,2020/10/21,Khadse’s exit exposes discontent over BJP sidelining OBC leaders,"12 BJP MLAs likely to switch sides: NCP

Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse’s decision to quit the party, which he served for 40 years, has brought to the fore the discontent within the State unit over the sidelining of leaders from the OBC community, a core voter base of the party.

Mr. Khadse was a product of the BJP’s social engineering programme in the 70s and 80s to attract OBC voters, with its Madhav (Mali, Dhangar and Vanjari) formula. Mr. Khadse has categorically put the blame on the Leader of Opposition, Devendra Fadnavis, and clarified that he has no ill feelings against the party and its leadership.

In the 2019 Assembly polls, Mr. Khadse and Chandrashekhar Bawankule, another OBC leader from Vidarbha and former power minister, were denied party tickets. Mr. Khadse’s daughter was then given the ticket at the last moment.

There was also speculation that Pankaja Munde, daughter of the late Gopinath Munde, would switch parties as she was unhappy with the functioning of Mr. Fadnavis, the then CM.

With Mr. Khadse joining the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the party hopes to regroup its lost strength in north Maharashtra and gain the support of the Leva-Patil community. NCP State president Jayant Patil has said another 12 BJP MLAs are in touch with the party and are likely to switch sides soon.

Reacting to the development, Mr. Fadnavis said Mr. Khadse was dealing in half-truths. He said, “I have nothing to comment as he wants to make a villain out of someone. The BJP is a big party and it won’t stop if one person leaves it. Jalgaon is a stronghold of the BJP and its people are with the party.” He added that no MLAs would leave the party.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/akgcac/article32913104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMEKNATHKHADSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/khadses-exit-exposes-discontent-over-bjp-sidelining-obc-leaders/article32912179.ece
374,2020/10/21,Navi Mumbai-Mumbai waterway to open soon,"₹111-crore project in final stages: CIDCO

The much-awaited waterway between Navi Mumbai and Mumbai is expected to start functioning from March next year.

The service was expected to start in May this year, but was delayed due to the pandemic. CIDCO said the ₹111-crore project to construct Nerul jetty is in the final stages of completion.

The Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB), the Bombay Port Trust (BPT) and CIDCO are jointly developing the waterway along the east coast of Mumbai, which will connect the city to Navi Mumbai and Raigad. Transport services will first begin on the Nerul-Bhaucha Dhakka route and then on the Nerul-Rewas-Mandwa route in Raigad district.

The BPT has built a water terminal at Bhaucha Dhakka, while the MMB constructed one at Mandwa. CIDCO is building the terminal at Nerul. The project will include a Ro-Ro (roll-on roll-off) service. On Monday, Thane MP Rajan Vichare reviewed the project along with CIDCO vice-chairman and managing director Sanjay Mukherjee.

“The journey from Navi Mumbai to Mumbai takes around two hours, but once the service starts, it will be reduced to 25 minutes. Plans to connect Vasai-Virar, Mira-Bhayander to Navi Mumbai are also in the pipeline,” Mr Vichare said.

CIDCO PRO Priya Ratambe said, “The work on the jetty started in April 2018 and was expected to finish by April 2020, but the pandemic and clearance from the Forest Department delayed the project. However, now it is back on track and will be finished in the next five months. MMB will run the ferry service.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/navi-mumbai-mumbai-waterway-to-open-soon/article32912150.ece
375,2020/10/21,"Eknath Khadse to join NCP, blames Fadnavis","I am certain that until the ex-CM is with BJP, I will not get justice, says OBC leader

Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and one of the tallest OBC leaders in the State, Eknath Khadse, on Wednesday resigned from the party, and said that he would be joining the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Friday.

Blaming former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis for his humiliation within the party as well as in public life, Mr. Khadse (68) said that he had no complaints against the rest of the BJP leadership. “I was harassed by cases, including those of outraging the modesty of a woman and land grabbing. I have come out clean in every case. But the trauma I had suffered for four years was tremendous. Mr. Fadnavis destroyed my life,” Mr. Khadse, who was number two in the 2014 State Cabinet, said.

The veteran BJP leader belongs to the first generation of ‘bahujan’ BJP leaders of late Gopinath Munde and late Pandurang Fundkar who did the ground work in 80s and 90s to expand the party.

Mr. Khadse said that he would not have thought of quitting the party which he had helped grow in Maharashtra for 40 years. “I feel sad about quitting the party but I am left with no choice. I am certain that until Mr. Fadnavis is with the BJP, I will not get justice within. Therefore, I have decided to part ways,” he said.

After being denied the CM’s post in 2014 by the BJP’s Central leadership, Mr. Khadse was always painted as a sulking figure who had to work under Mr. Fadnavis, a junior to him within the party ranks. He had openly said that the BJP should have chosen a ‘bahujan’ face as Maharashtra CM instead of Mr. Fadnavis.

“I knew the party discipline and how the government worked. If Mr. Fadnavis was the CM, then I had to work under him and I was doing so. But it seemed he always felt threatened by my presence. I was spied upon, complaints were filed against me, inquiries were set up, and I was asked to resign,” he said.

Mr. Khadse’s decision comes after months of speculation and despite efforts by the BJP State leadership to stop him from switching sides. State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said, “We tried our best to stop him. We hoped that he would not quit, despite being angry on certain issues. We tried to solve them. We wish him to do good work in his new party.”

Earlier in the day, Maharashtra NCP president and Irrigation Minister Jayant Patil announced that that Mr. Khadse had resigned from the BJP and would be joining the NCP on Friday.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray welcomed the decision of Mr. Khadse to join the NCP and the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. “The BJP should analyse as to why its base is being dismantled while it is conquering new heights,” Mr. Thackeray said.

Mr. Khadse, an OBC leader from north Maharashtra, enjoys dominance in his native Jalgaon district and also in different constituencies in the region. His daughter-in-law Raksha Khadse is a BJP Lok Sabha MP from Raver constituency.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/73ra6y/article32829189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMEKNATHKHADSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/eknath-khadse-quits-bjp-to-join-ncp-on-friday/article32907392.ece
376,2020/10/21,Western Railway adds 4 ‘ladies special’ local trains in Mumbai,"A day after Railway Minister Piyush Goyal allowed all women passengers to travel in local trains in Mumbai, the Western Railway on Wednesday added four ‘ladies special’ trains on its suburban network.

Women will be allowed to board the other suburban trains also during the non-peak hours, officials said.

Railway authorities resumed the local train services in the metropolis from June 15.

Currently, only those engaged in essential services as categorised by the Maharashtra government are allowed to travel in the local trains run by the Central Railway and the Western Railway, through a QR code mechanism.

With the addition of four ladies special trains, the Western Railway (WR) is now running six trains only for women.

The overall daily services on WR network has gone up to 704 amid the COVID-19 lockdown, a railway official said.

Besides, the Central Railway (CR) is running 706 local train services, including four ladies special trains, in the city and suburbs, he said.

The railway authorities have permitted women to travel in local trains on both the CR and WR routes during non-peak hours - from 11 am to 3 pm and 7 pm onwards - from Wednesday.

Goyal made the announcement on Tuesday, after the Maharashtra government sent a second letter to the railway authorities to consider the request at the earliest.

The state government had earlier written to the Railways on October 16, requesting that all women be allowed to travel in the local trains.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3d21gp/article32907110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mumbai-local,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/western-railway-adds-4-ladies-special-local-trains-in-mumbai/article32907106.ece
377,2020/10/21,Women can travel on local trains from today,"Four days after the Maharashtra government allowed women to travel on suburban local trains, Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday said that the move would come into effect from October 21.

“I am happy to announce that Railways will allow women to travel on suburban trains from 21 Oct between 11 am to 3 pm & after 7 pm. We were always ready and with the receipt of letter from Maharashtra Govt today, we have allowed this travel,” Mr. Goyal tweeted.

The announcement comes after Maharashtra Chief Secretary Sanjay Kumar sent a reminder to the Central Railway and the Western Railway.

“The State government vide the above mentioned letters had communicated that all the women commuters with a valid ticket may be allowed to board trains during the non-peak hours (11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and again 7 p.m. onwards till the end of local services for that day) as per the discussion held between the representatives of all stakeholders, including the State and the Railways,” the letter from Mr. Kumar said.

“However, the implementation of the joint decision is yet to be initiated,” he added.

The Central government’s decision, however, followed a political slugfest with the Congress accusing the BJP of playing dirty politics.

“There have been four meetings with Railways officials: first in September, second on October 9, and third and fourth on October 13. In the last meeting, Railways officers deliberated with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and police officials for two-and-a-half hours. All aspects were discussed and a decision to implement the move on October 17 was taken. But on October 16, the Railways backed out and started talking about the Railway Board permission,” State Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said.

Mr. Sawant claimed that the announcement by Mr. Goyal came after pressure was put on his department by the State government and the Congress. “Earlier, the Railways was giving flimsy reasons to not allow women commuters. Now, the Union minister says that the decision has been taken based on the Chief Secretary’s letter. That means there were no real issues but only dirty politics by the BJP to delay the announcement,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/women-can-travel-on-local-trains-from-today/article32904820.ece

The Maharashtra Cyber Cell has arrested a 25-year-old man for siphoning off money from the bank accounts of Paytm app users after fraudulently accessing their user names and passwords.

Mohammed Munna Ansari (25), a resident of Ghatkopar, worked as a field sales executive for a firm in Andheri hired by Paytm to introduce the app to local traders.

“After helping traders install the app, he would steal their bank account details and later siphon off money. We have found 350 user names and passwords in his custody. We are investigating how many people he has cheated so far,” said Balsingh Rajput, Superintendent of Police, Maharashtra Cyber Cell.

Rajesh Patel, a dairy trader, had filed a complaint that ₹59,448 had been withdrawn from his bank account between August 20 and September 20. Paytm had sent an email alerting him of someone suspiciously logging into his account.

The accused was charged under Sections 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, and Sections 43, 66 and 66 (C) of the Information Technology Act.

380,2020/10/21,"PNB hasn’t recovered any money from Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi: RTI reply","Duo collectively owes the bank ₹15,423.39 crore

The Punjab National Bank (PNB) has neither recovered any cash nor any amount from the auction of various assets seized from fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi, according to a reply given by the bank under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

Mr. Modi and Mr. Choksi, the prime accused in the alleged fraudulent issuance of Letters of Undertaking, collectively owes ₹15,423.39 crore to the public sector bank. Mr. Modi was earlier arrested in London and his extradition process is pending.

The information dated September 28, 2020, was provided to social worker Jeetendra Ghadge, whose RTI application the bank had rejected, but relented after filing the first appeal. While Mr. Modi owes ₹7409,07,25,776 (₹7,409.07 crore), Mr. Choksi has to pay dues worth ₹8014,32,41,616 (₹8,014.32 crore).

The bank had not replied to a query on the recovery of dues till the time of writing this report. The also bank refused to reveal the total assets seized from the duo.

‘It would impede the process of investigation of apprehension or prosecution of offenders that is exempted from disclosure U/S 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act, 2005. Hence, the information cannot be given,” the bank said.

Another RTI application was filed seeking information on the legal expenses incurred by the PNB in pursuit of these cases. The bank refused to provide the information saying it would hamper the investigation.

Mr. Ghadge said, “The money involved in the scam does not belong to the bank, but to the people of India. Ultimately, we have lost ₹15,423 crore, which would have helped us build hospitals and other infrastructure. It is unfortunate that three years on we are unable to catch the offenders and recover the money.”

The bank did not respond to a request to comment on the RTI reply.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5uwr34/article23472617.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mehul-Nirav-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pnb-hasnt-recovered-any-money-from-nirav-modi-mehul-choksi-rti-reply/article32904133.ece

382,2020/10/21,Efforts on to raise MCH to global standards: CM,"New diagnostic equipment inaugurated

The government is trying to raise the Government Medical College Hospital here, the first in the State, to international standards, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

He was speaking after inaugurating digital subtraction angiography, digital fluoroscopy, and digital mammogram machine at the Radio Diagnosis department of the hospital here on Tuesday.

Second phase

The Chief Minister said ₹194.33 crore had been sanctioned for the second phase of the hospital master plan.

A six-storey Medical Laboratory Technology (MLT) block, 11-storey paediatric block, and eight-storey surgical block were coming up in this phase.

The MLT block would have a lecture hall, lab, mini conference hall, and library.

Paediatric block

The SAT paediatric block will have medical gas room, out-patient consultation, lab, radio diagnosis, wards and so on, while the surgical block will have procedure rooms, 16 operation theatres, and wards.

The government had already sanctioned ₹5 crore to upgrade the stroke centre, he said.

The digital subtraction angiography machine, set up at a cost of ₹6 crore, would help obtain accurate depiction of blood vessels, thus helping treat serious illnesses such as blocks, cancer, stroke, blood pressure, and so on.

The digital fluoroscopy machine has been installed at a cost of ₹65 lakh.

It aids in studying the functioning of the internal organs using a form of X-ray in real-time.

These tests carried out by a radiologist need to be printed on a film only in cases it is necessary, thus saving on the film’s expense.

Breast cancer

The digital mammography machine, costing ₹1 crore, was donated by the Thiruvananthapuram district Rotary Club.

The machine aids in the early detection of breast cancer, and is hence very essential for a public health system.

The diagnostic test will cost anything above ₹3,500 in the private sector.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/efforts-on-to-raise-mch-to-global-standards-cm/article32905829.ece
383,2020/10/21,Vconsol to help students perform well in exams,"Platform can host more people using less data

The district panchayat and the District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) have roped in the award-winning Techgentsia Software Technologies Pvt. Ltd. to support students from Classes 10 to 12 to perform well in the public examinations.

The Vidyajyothi scheme that had been launched by the district panchayat in association with DIET a few years ago was found to be very successful. However, with schools still closed owing to the pandemic and classes remaining digital as part of the State government’s First Bell programme, the challenge was how to ensure that Vidyajyothi study material, prepared by expert teachers in an easy-to-understand format, reached students.

It is to overcome these challenges that the district panchayat turned to Vconsol, developed by Techgentsia that won the Union government’s ‘Grand challenge for developing video conference solution.’

Increase in reach

Not only does Vconsol reduce data use, it can include more people thus increasing its reach, Techgentsia CEO Joy Sebastian was quoted in a statement.

At a time, nearly 300 students can watch the classes. Through the link provided to a school, the students can not only watch the classes taken by the teachers but also interact with them and clear their doubts.

Govt. recognition

Classes can also be recorded and stored on Vconsol. Students who cannot log in for the online classes can watch these recorded classes whenever possible.

The services of Vconsol were bring provided completely free, district panchayat Education standing committee chairperson V. Ranjith said.

Activities connected with the First Bell classes and teachers’ classes shot in a studio by DIET can be conveyed to students, DIET Principal in-charge T.R. Sheejakumari said.

384,2020/10/21,Nod for 7.5 % quota likely,"303 government school students may get admission

The State government was hopeful of seeing through admission of 303 government school students, who have cleared National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test into medical and dental courses, in view of the Bill passed in the Assembly for 7.5% horizontal reservation, School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan said on Wednesday.

‘We are expecting a positive development shortly,’ he told media persons when asked to comment on why the Governor had not granted assent to the Bill yet. Enrolment in government schools had gone up by more than four lakh this year owing to the development of academic infrastructure in schools, he said. He cited the admission of two government school students in B.Tech. programmes of National Institution of Technology - Tiruchi as proof of good education.

The School Education Department plans to establish over 7,200 smart classrooms in government schools before this year-end, he said earlier while addressing a function organised to hand over certificates for two-year extension of recognition to private schools in Tiruchi and surrounding districts.

The government had decided to issue certificates for extension of recognition with two-year validity, instead of one year, to private schools to save them from hassles, he said. The validity of the certificates will be extended to three years if a petition in the Supreme Court on the issue was withdrawn.

The Minister handed over certificates to managements of 525 schools in Tiruchi, Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam, in the presence of Ministers Vellamandi N. Natarajan and S. Valarmathi.

385,2020/10/21,Heritage enthusiasts disappointed,"Perambalur brought under ASI Chennai Circle

While the creation of new administrative circle of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in Tiruchi has warmed the cockles of the historians and conservationists, heritage enthusiasts from Perambalur district are a disappointed lot as their district has now been brought under the Chennai Circle.

With the bifurcation of the Chennai Circle, Tiruchi has got 162 monuments and sites in about 20 districts under its jurisdiction. Most of the important monuments in the State are under Tiruchi Circle. Perambalur district, despite being just about 50 km away from Tiruchi, has been brought under the Chennai Circle.

“It was a great pleasure to see the formation of a new circle in Tiruchi. But it is shocking that Perambalur has been annexed to the Chennai Circle,” observed Ramesh Karuppaiah, a heritage enthusiast of the district. The famous Ranjankudi Fort in the Perambalur district is maintained by ASI, he pointed.

“We were hoping that the creation of the Tiruchi Circle will lead to the improvement of Ranjankudi Fort, Valikandapuram Shiva Temple, Samskan Mosque and Karai in the Perambalur area,” he said.

Pointing out that Perambalur district and Ariyalur district were once part of the integrated Tiruchi district, Mr.Karuppaiah contended that just as Ariyalur, Perambalur too should be retained under the Tiruchi Circle of the ASI. “We will be happy if our plea is considered and a change is made,” he added.

Activists also point out that Ranjankudi Fort, a 17th-century fortress located about 22 km north of Perambalur, could be developed as a picnic or tourist spot. The ASI, a few years ago, had executed some development works at the fort. The State Tourism Department is also said to be looking at improving amenities at the site and they were expecting a further push to tap the tourism potential of the area with the creation of the new circle.

A senior ASI official said that Perambalur district may have been included under Chennai Circle to maintain a healthy ratio of the number of protected monuments/sites under each circle. However, it was a policy decision taken by the ASI headquarters and any decision of change in jurisdictional areas could be taken only in New Delhi, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/heritage/article32910831.ece

387,2020/10/21,Dalit leader observes fast,"The panchayat president of Perugamani in Andanallur block observed fast on Wednesday alleging that the vice-president of the panchayat and other officials were discriminating against her. A Scheduled Caste woman, A. Kirthika Arunkumar, alleged that some officials were not cooperative.

She said that three officials, including a ward member and the vice-president, had made false allegations against her. ‘They claimed that I was involved in some corrupt activities. This is false and is being done so that I will be removed from my post,’ she said. She claimed that the three officials have been boycotting meetings and programmes ever since she was elected. ‘They do not even enter a room if I am in it. They refuse to sign documents too,’ she said.

She tolerated the ‘caste discrimination’ ever since she had been elected panchayat president but decided to raise a complaint after allegations were made, she said. ‘I have raised a complaint with the Block Development Officer several times, but in vain. I decided to draw attention to their atrocities after at least five complaints,’ Ms. Arunkumar said.

She withdrew the hunger strike after the Block Development Officer V. Nirmala intervened and assured to address her complaints. ‘I have called for a meeting of all ward members and officials and will enquire about the panchayat president’s claims.

In deference to the directions of the Central Government, the Kendriya Vidyalayas are in the process of collecting feedback from parents on conducting regular classes for levels IX to XII.

‘Of course, we are ready to conduct classes. But then, the parents have the say on this matter. By and large, parents seem to be reconciled to the outcome of the online classes, and are not prepared to take the risk of sending their wards to the schools,’ the principal of a Kendriya Vidyalaya said. The KVs had completed half-yearly examinations earlier this month, and the short week-long vacation has also begun. Multiple choice questions were asked for the online examination of one-hour duration for each subject, he said.

As for the private CBSE schools, the standing instructions of the State Government have to be followed. Private school managements are wary of starting regular classes after what they perceive as the ‘risky experimentation’ by Andhra Pradesh government to open schools. The move had turned counter-productive, leading to further spread of the pandemic, school principals say.

Since the CBSE schools had started the online classes early on, they have been able to complete close to 80% of the portions, after factoring in the 25 % cut in contents this year due to the pandemic. ‘Nevertheless, we cover the portions deleted for this academic year also, keeping in mind the need to keep the students fully prepared for competitive examinations for entry into professional courses,’ said C.J. Chacko, principal, Samad Senior Secondary School.

Following the Central Government’s plan for re-opening of schools, the Anna Science Centre - Planetarium in Tiruchi had held an awareness programme for teachers and parents on Tuesday. The programme titled ‘Meet your Medical Expert’ programme was conducted to allay apprehensions in the minds of parents, its Project Director R. Ahilan said.

Interacting online with parents and school teachers, M.A. Aleem, former vice-principal, K.A.P.Viswanatham Government Medical College Hospital, Tiruchi, said students must desist from sharing pencils, pens or erasers, as an extreme precaution to prevent the spread of the pandemic.

389,2020/10/21,Entire harvested paddy will be procured,"Food Minister R.Kamaraj has announced that the entire quantity of ‘kuruvai’ paddy harvested in delta districts will be procured.

Talking to reporters at Thennamanadu in Orathanadu block on Wednesday, he said that private traders seem to have refrained from purchasing paddy from the farmers this ‘kuruvai’ season. So, flow of grains to the direct purchase centres in the delta districts recorded a steep increase compared to previous seasons.

As of October 21, the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation had procured 65 lakh bags of paddy from the farmers which is the highest in terms of procurement during the first month of procurement season which commences from October 1 every year. Around 40,000 acres out of 3.45 lakh acres of ‘kuruvai’ paddy cultivated in the delta district this season was yet to get harvested.

Stating that all the paddy brought to the DPCs irrespective of the moisture content would be procured from farmers, he said that if needed additional DPCs would be opened in areas such as Thennamanadu where flow of grains was high.

When his attention was brought to the accusation from the opposition parties that ‘fair and reasonable’ minimum support price for paddy was not offered, he said that in 2010 when the main opposition party was at the helm of affairs both in the State and Centre the MSP offered to paddy was ₹1,100 per quintal. But now the MSP for paddy is ₹1950 per quintal, he said.

Similarly, the present AIADMK government alone had allowed the corporation to hike the number of paddy bags to be procured in a day to 1000 bags from 800 bags in order to alleviate the sufferings of the farmers, he added.

Earlier, the minister inspected the procurement process at the DPC in Thalikottai, Mannarugudi taluk in Tiruvarur district where he said that a letter had been written to the Union government seeking further relaxation in moisture content. However, every grain harvested by the farmers would be procured, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/paddy/article32909505.ece
390,2020/10/21,Water seepage continues at anicut,"Farmers are worried over the continued water seepage from the Aachampatti Ayyanar Anicut in Budalur taluk despite some repairs carried out at the structure.

The anicut built across a jungle stream is located at a short distance of around 15 km from the Grand Anicut and could hold water in about 200 acre spread if properly maintained. This year, rejuvenation of the water holding area and repair of shutters were taken up at a cost of around ₹50 lakhs under the ‘kudimaramathu’ scheme.

Meanwhile, heavy rain lashed the catchment areas of the anicut at Gandharvakottai taluk in Pudukottai district during the first week of this month. Huge quantity of rainwater flowed into the anicut area only to get drained within two days as the shutters of this water body were not closed in view of the ongoing work, lamented villagers.

On hearing the news, the Communist Party of India cadre led by party’s union secretary, R.Ramachandran visited the spot and staged a demonstration. Subsequently, officials from the Public Works Department, Aginiyaru division, assured them that the shutters would be closed properly.

However, rainwater that accumulated in the anicut water holding area due to heavy precipitation in Thachankuruchi, Manganur and other hamlets in Gandharvakottai taluk for the past two days continued to drain from the water body through a gap in one of the shutters, claimed a Aachampatti CPI unit office-bearer, R.R.Mugil on Wednesday.

Repeated requests from the locals and farmers to bring maintenance of the anicut under the Lower Cauvery Basin control has failed to evoke favourable response, he said and pointed out that it takes more time for officials from the Agniyaru division office, located at around 80 km away from the village, to reach the spot in case of any emergency. The water body served as the main source not only for agricultural operations in this region but also as a reliable source for recharging ground water table, he added.

Meanwhile, a section of farmers in Vanniyampatti hamlet in Sengipatti Village Panchayat in Budalur block had cleared an encroachment on the water inlet channel of Panchanoorani lake with support from the cadre of the CPI and the CPM on Wednesday.

The issue of encroachment was brought to the notice of the officials well in advance but no stone was turned to get the water inlet channel cleared of the encroachment. Though the region received good precipitation in the last few days, the lake remained empty. The farmers supported by the Communist cadres cleared the encroachment on the inlet channel to ensure the flow of rain water into the lake, sources said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/water/article32909454.ece

As part of its effort to protect the historical monuments, the Department of Archaeology has carried out conservation works in the tower, the fort and the moat around it.

“It is one of the 12 projects funded by the Asian Development Bank. The Chief Minister has already inaugurated three monuments and another seven will be inaugurated soon,” Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture Minister K. Pandiarajan said.

The 75-foot hexagonal structure has eight layers, and is surrounded by a moat and a fort. It also functioned as a lighthouse. A stone tablet in the fort says in Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and English that “it was constructed by Maharaja, a friend and ally of the British, to commemorate triumphs of British Arms and downfall of Bonaparte”. Manora derived from the word minaret. It is also called ‘Jayasthampam’. The total cost of the restoration project is ₹2.30 crore.

“We think that only Rajasthan is the State of forts. But Tamil Nadu also has a lot of forts, and it is our duty to secure a place for these forts in the tourist guide. We are also planning to publish a cultural text similar to the texts published by Rajasthan and Delhi,” Mr. Pandiarajan told The Hindu.

K. Olimalik, Assistant Executive Engineer of the Department of Archaeology, said the restoration work included a special coating on the walls to prevent erosion caused by the salty winds of the sea. “We have erected fencing and done face-lifting by creating a lawn around the structure,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/97pybq/article32905836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20OCTTHMONUMENT-STATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/manora-fort-in-thanjavur-gets-a-facelift/article32905837.ece
394,2020/10/21,"Stay away from Dasara festivities, SP tells staff","‘Prevalence of grim situation in the wake of COVID-19 the reason’

Superintendent of Police M. Ravindranath Babu has asked the police personnel and their family members not to celebrate Dasara festivities in the wake of the situation prevailing in some police families due to COVID-19.

As many as 15 police personnel died due to various reasons this year, including six with coronavirus, and 297 policemen were affected by the virus in the district. The recovery percentage was good, the SP said.

Mr. Ravindranath Babu said as part of the ten-day Police Commemoration Day activities, which begin with the commemoration day parade on Wednesday, officers would visit the bereaved families and enquire about their welfare.

“Hundreds of police personnel were suffering with COVID and their families were in distress. I request the staff to stay away from celebrations and focus on helping the needy,” the SP urged the staff.

He said that 2,300 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits, 30,000 litres of sanitiser (in bottles), vitamin tablets, 300 thermo scanners, oximeters, dry fruits, hand washers, cleaners, juice bottles and other material wee supplied to the police free of cost.

Promotions

Mr. Ravindranath Babu said that 19 civil and one armed reserve ASIs were promoted as Sub-Inspectors, 70 head constables were elevated as Assistant Sub-Inspectors (ASIs) and 60 constables were promoted as head constables in Krishna district.

Scholarships worth about ₹66 lakh were given to 60 police children on merit basis.

395,2020/10/21,Timely treatment saves youth’s leg from amputation,"Dhana Srinivas (18), an avid sports lover, hailing from the city, could have lost his right leg as a side effect of contracting COVID-19 virus a month ago but for the timely intervention of doctors at Medicover Hospitals.

The traces of coronavirus had an adverse impact on the lower limb of the boy, leading to acute thrombosis, which could have necessitated amputation.

The team of experts at Medicover Hospitals identified the problem after conducting a CT angiography of the limb, decided on the treatment procedure. Srinivas was admitted to the hospital on October 2 and on the following day, he was put through a series of corrective procedures like thrombectomy, peripheral angioplasty and pedal arch reconstruction, to salvage the limb.

Siba Sankar Dalai, interventional neuro radiologist at Medicover Hospitals, said that amputating the leg would have ended the dreams and aspirations of the boy. He responded to the treatment quickly, and was back on his feet and discharged from the hospital on October 9.

Dr. Dalai emphasises that COVID-19 was not just a dangerous disease in the acute phase, but causes severe morbidity and mortality, even after the cure. Many of the COVID patients were showing thromboembolic complications, a few weeks after being completely cured of the virus. They were generally presenting with gangrene of leg and hand, and brain stroke. Srinivas was one such unfortunate victim.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/timely-treatment-saves-youths-leg-from-amputation/article32904550.ece
396,2020/10/21,Apollo launches Post-COVID Recovery Clinics,"‘They will help patients deal with effects of infection’

The Apollo Hospitals Group announced the launch of ‘Post-COVID Recovery Clinics’ across the hospital network on Monday.

These clinics will address the needs of the rising number of patients, who have recovered from COVID, but are suffering from mid and long-term persistent effects of the infection.

Over 50% of COVID patients suffer from problems that include breathlessness, chest pain and heart issues, joint pains, vision problems, and memory loss, months after contracting the novel coronavirus. The clinics will be manned by a team of specialists, including neurologists and immunologists, to help patients deal with the aftermath of COVID-19 and restore their health.

Sami, Chief Operating Officer, Apollo Hospitals, Visakhapatnam, said that these clinics would help patients to get the specialised care they need. The trained clinicians ensure that the patients get the correct treatment and recover completely.

COVID-19 impacts almost all the vital organs in the body. Apart from acute events like stroke and myocardial infarction, chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension are part of the post-COVID syndrome. A number of sudden deaths in post-COVID patients have been reported and most of these were attributed to acute cardiac events.

He explained that while long-term problems were common among patients who have been hospitalised, even patients who had recovered from a mild case could suffer from the prolonged effects of the virus. Some of the long-term effects may be severe and disabling in nature. The specialised clinic would enable monitoring of symptoms on an ongoing basis and deliver timely medical attention.

The clinics were being initially launched in Apollo hospitals treating COVID-19 in Visakhapatnam, Chennai, Madurai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mysore, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar, Guwahati, Delhi, Indore, Lucknow, Mumbai and Ahmedabad. The clinics would be manned by a dedicated team consisting of a family physician, assisted by a nurse.

For appointments, one can visit Apollo Hospitals, Visakhapatnam, either at Health City and Ramnagar, or call: 0891-2867777/2727272.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/apollo-launches-post-covid-recovery-clinics/article32904526.ece
397,2020/10/21,CPI(M) seeks continuation of Best Available Schools scheme,"‘It benefited a large number of SC/ST, BC, minority students’

The CPI(M) district committee has sought continuation of the scheme for provision of education to SC/ST, BC and minority students through Best Available Schools scheme, which has produced good results among these students over the years. In a letter to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday, party district committee secretary K. Lokanadham and district secretariat member Killo Surendra noted that there were 12 such schools under the purview of the Paderu ITDA.

A total of 3,340 students were studying in these schools. The idea of starting this scheme was to encourage and motivate talented students from these communities to go for higher studies. It’s unfortunate that the scheme is being scrapped now on the plea that ‘Amma Vodi’ scheme was introduced under ‘Navaratnalu.’

The CPI(M) leaders recalled that the scheme was introduced by former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy in 2005 with the objective of providing corporate education free of cost to the poor. The students of these schools were being provided hostel accommodation and nutritious food and the government was reimbursing the expenditure on books and fee. Many of the passouts of these schools had joined engineering, medicine and civil services after qualifying in the entrance tests, they said.

The orders issued by the YSR Congress Party government, on September 28, withdrawing the scheme on the plea that ‘Amma Vodi’ was introduced, was causing unrest among the beneficiaries and their parents. They noted that the decision goes against the vision of Dr. Rajasekhara Reddy, who wanted to benefit the poor through the scheme.

They demanded withdrawal of the orders and continuation of the scheme.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/cpim-seeks-continuation-of-best-available-schools-scheme/article32904493.ece
398,2020/10/21,Police Commemoration Day: parade at Beach Road,"Officials laud services of personnel in the pandemic

The city and district police will be observing Police Commemoration Day on Wednesday and will organise a commemoration parade near Police Martyrs’ Memorial, Beach Road, at 7.30 a.m.

Police personnel, their families, senior officials from district administration, Ministers, MLAs and other political representatives will pay tribute to the police martyrs on the occasion.

The day is observed every year in remembrance of the 10 CRPF men who had laid down their lives fighting Chinese aggression at Hot Springs in Ladakh on October 21, 1959. A contingent of 20 men led by Sub-Inspector Karam Singh of the CRPF was ambushed by the Chinese Army. While 10 died fighting, others were imprisoned.

Police Commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha said that police personnel who have been working in the frontline since the outbreak of the pandemic have performed bravely in non-combat situation.

Deputy Inspector General ( DIG - Visakha Range) L.K.V. Ranga Rao recalled the services of police personnel in the range limits, especially during the pandemic. He urged people to recognise the services of police. He said that around 12 police personnel had died while on duty during the pandemic from three districts — Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam.

He said that following instructions from the higher officials, a series of programmes will be conducted from October 21 to November 1, marking the day, following the safety norms.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/police-commemoration-day-parade-at-beach-road/article32904436.ece
399,2020/10/21,Vegetable prices hit the roof,"Crops suffered extensive damage due to the recent rains, say officials

Skyrocketing prices of vegetables in these times of COVID-19 add to the woes of the poor and middle class families, who have already been hit by the pandemic. Rates of almost all vegetables are on the rise and a family of four has to shell out not less than ₹500 on vegetables per week.

Onion price is ₹57 a kg at rythu bazaars and in the open market it is around ₹80 a kg. Field and cluster beans are priced at ₹70 and ₹50 respectively, capsicum around ₹65, potals at ₹52, tomatoes hover around ₹35 and bitter gourd ₹40. Onion is most common ingredient, which goes into almost all Indian curries.

An average Indian family will need at least two to three kilograms of onions a week. Same is the case with tomato, which is added in most Indian curries and dals, as it gives a distinct taste and flavour.

Vegetables grown in 26 hectares, banana crop in 23.6 hectares, and papaya in over 84 hectares in 49 villages of 15 mandals in the district, suffered extensive damage due to the recent rains, according to District Collector V. Vinay Chand.

“We are hardly getting any vegetables for ₹200. Despite the threat of the virus looming large, some consumers, especially youths, jump the queue and fail to observe physical distance. This is observed more at onion and tomato stalls at the Rythu Bazaars,” says D. Nagajyothi, a professional LIC Agent, residing at MVP Colony.

“Most of the local farmers, who grow vegetables, switch over to paddy before the rains,” says a farmer at the Kancharapalem Rythu Bazaar.

“Fifty metric tonnes (two lorry loads) of onions are normally sold every day through the 13 Rythu Bazaars in the city. An additional two lorry loads would be sold in the open market. Due to heavy rains in Maharashtra, from where we get most of our onion stocks, we are only getting one lorry load for the Rythu Bazaars,” says the Assistant Director of Marketing M. Kaleswara Rao.

“The heavy rains this year in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra have caused extensive damage to crops and resulted in the steep hike in vegetable prices. Tomatoes are grown mostly in Kurnool and Karnataka and heavy rains have damaged the crop in a large area,” says A. Kurma Rao, vice president of the Wholesale Vegetable Dealers Association, Gnanapuram.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/ou0jov/article32904414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20-VZ-RYTHUBAZAAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/vegetable-prices-hit-the-roof/article32904415.ece

402,2020/10/21,Virtual Lakme Fashion Week’s couture celebration,"Super models Lakshmi Rana, Candice Pinto and Deepti Gujral share their experiences of walking the ramp at digital LFW 2020 without a cheering crowd

For supermodels Lakshmi Rana, Candice Pinto and Deepti Gujral, fashion shows mean backstage frenzy with a swarm of designers, make-up artists and hairdressers, walking the ramp in a new ensemble to cheering fashion connoisseurs, influencers, celebrities and flashbulbs popping. “These memories are etched forever,” say the trio who will make a new beginning with digital Lakme Fashion Week 2020 from October 20-25. The models share their preparations, challenges and how they miss the live action in the post-pandemic fashion world.

Relieved to be back

“Media buzz, around 30 photographers taking pictures from the front row and a cheering audience are the norm at any fashion show. A digital show is much quieter; it’s sans audience and with only the crew,” says Lakshmi Rana who walks for designers Pankaj & Nidhi and Rimzim Dadu. She adds, “The live buzz is missing but everyone’s grateful to see the efforts to get the fashion industry back in order and give people work. Shoots in a digital format may not be as exciting as a live show, but it is a relief to be back.”

Lakme Fashion Week shoots were done in the first week of October and post-production work was completed in the last few days.

Modalities involved

So how does a digital show work? A camera crew captures models walking on a ramp, showcasing the dsigns; multiple shots of different camera angles are then edited and presented in a grand way.

In contemporary fashion shows, models have to work fast since they showcase multiple outfits in a single show. In contrast, digital shows take more time due to re-takes to ensure the team gets the perfect shot. “The camera zooms in on designs and models need patience to follow instructions to suit the camera,” says Candice Pinto, who has modelled for two decades. She calls the cheering audience in a live show ‘an extra boost’. “We do miss that element but after having done fashion shows for so many years, it doesn’t affect us.”

Digital show amid safety measures One can be at home and still sit in the front row to watch Amit Agarwal’s new collection or a multi-designer showcase at the first digital Lakme Fashion week (LFW) between October 20 to 25. Organised jointly by Lakmé and IMG Reliance, the virtual fashion platform showcases season-fluid collections, Gen Nex shows and sustainable fashion. “The platform embarks on a digital journey with new formats of display using advanced technology; While events that we manage are held over several months, adapting the same level of safety regulations for a five-day shoot was a challenge,” says Jaspreet Chandok, Head – lifestyle businesses, IMG Reliance.

Participants at the shoot were in a ‘bubble’ following safety protocols — four to six days of home quarantine and a three-day room isolation at St. Regis, Mumbai. Jaspreet adds the hotel implemented contact-less dining providing over 4500 + meals boxes for five days to the members.

Staff monitoring social distancing norms, usage of masks, face shields and gloves were in place with separate green rooms. Says Jaspreet, “The venue (St. Regis, Mumbai) had social distancing and sanitisation stickers placed as reminders at different places to ensure safety measures. Over 800 COVID-19 tests were conducted during the shoot and drivers were also quarantined and tested prior to being on duty.”

One can watch the live stream by registering on Lakme Fashion Week website from October 20 to 25

In her first digital show, Candice showcases designs by Manish Malhotra, Gaurang (Gaurang Gupta), JADE by Monica & Karishma and Abraham & Thakore. Admitting she was hesitant, she says, “Being from Mumbai, the worst-hit city, safety was the the first thing that crossed my mind. The protocol of testing us one week before isolating us in a hotel made us agree to the show. We were excited but also scared of the situation.”

Lakshmi, who had also participated in Digital India Couture Week 2020 adds, “It was amazing to see camera capturing even intricate details in a virtual display. I am also eager to see how the production team uses the shots in front of a green screen. There were just eight of us (models) shooting between shows.”

Deepti Gujral walking in her first virtual fashion week for Gaurang, Manish Malhotra, Bemberg Presents Hemang Agrawal says, “There is so much happening in the country, not just the pandemic but even the economy is low. It is a big thing if amid all this, we are able to keep the industry alive with a virtual show.”

The models would start by 10 am and wrap by 6 pm. According to Deepti, the best part of a virtual show is its re-shoots and editing scenes but the shows too have a time limit. “There is an equal amount of pressure and hard work. One can definitely take more shots but with four shows in a day, one cannot spend time re-shooting. Models have to be versatile to give good shots so that one can move on to the next shot to save time.”

Lakshmi considers her Rohit Bal’s show for Lakme Fashion Week Finale done four years ago at St Stephen’s College as her favourite. “The entire building was lit up, creating an amazing imagery; The show for Amit Agarwal at the iconic Mukesh Mills in Colaba was also special.”

She adds, “ Keeping the pandemic scenario in mind, I feel a sense of gratitude. However, I hope things will normalise by next year. I don’t think this is the only pandemic we are facing and there could be things which may go wrong later. People have discovered many positive points in a virtual format and I feel it is the future.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/c2d8bf/article32907270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym21deepti-gujral,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/super-models-lakshmi-rana-candice-pinto-and-deepti-gujral-on-walking-the-ramp-at-the-digital-lfw-2020-without-a-cheering-crowd/article32907273.ece
403,2020/10/21,Take your pick at this online festival of saris,"It celebrates designs in six yards and brings alive the country’s looms that have been silent owing to the pandemic

With the country opening up gradually during the pandemic, buying handloom is not particularly high on people’s priority list, feels Bharathy Harish, coordinator of Madhurya Creations in Bengaluru. Weavers were hit hard by COVID-19. “Diverse communities with unique weaving patterns developed over the last 5,000 years are our country’s pride and joy. It is our duty to help our weavers; towards that end, Madhurya Creations is hosting House of Heritage, an online project to help weavers showcase their unsold stock.”

Madhurya Creations was started by Art of Living to revive the traditional arts and crafts of India. “We work with weavers from several parts of the country including Kanchipuram, Uppada, Paithan, Chanderi, Maheshwar, Banaras, Kota, Phulia and Ilkal in North Karnataka. We create designs that combine motifs and patterns from different parts of the country,” explains Bharathy.

Bharathy says weavers have been unable to sell what they had woven before lockdown. “They have been forced to look for alternative employment as construction workers or domestic help. There are entire weaving villages that have no other means of income. If we make a conscious decision to support these weavers during the festival season, it will go a long way in keeping their looms alive.”

With 1,080 weavers on board, the online showcase will have saris for all occasions, ranging from daily wear to bridal wear and everything in between. One of Madhurya Creations’ revival efforts is Uppada saris. “It is woven in the jamdani style by a handful of weavers in the quaint village of Uppada in the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. We are not only reviving traditional designs but are also focussing on current trends in terms of colour and motifs,” she adds.

Bharathy says there is an effort to decode the meaning of traditional motifs and weaves on social media. For instance, what is the significance of Benarsi silk for weddings? “Varanasi is considered one of the oldest cities of the world and is in some sense, eternal. When people get married, they want their relationship to last forever and the Benarasi sari symbolises this perfectly.”

The sale is on till Deepavali. For details, visit https://www.madhurya.com/.

Regal selection

House of Heritage has a Royal Selection featuring saris chosen by 25 women of royal lineage. Shailaraje Pawar of Dhar in Madhya Pradesh says, “My family supports the handmade Bagh prints of Dhar district. Weavers of the region have been patronised by our fore fathers, and we will continue to do this.”

Rasika Prakash and Divyashree Kumari of Sirmur, Uttarakhand, say that they favour hand-painted and printed, as well as gold and silver thread zari on chiffons.

Says Mayurakshi Singh of Arki in Himachal Pradesh. “We must have initiatives that adapt to changing trade and consumer patterns, so that by our purchase of a national handloom product we would be incentivising a fading craft.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/33eby/article32906976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KNP1388-Edit-Edit,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/take-your-pick-at-this-online-festival-of-saris/article32906981.ece
404,2020/10/21,Current Chernobyl-level radiation harmful to bees: study,"Researchers exposed bee colonies in a laboratory setting to a range of radiation levels found in areas of the exclusion zone around the ruined Chernobyl site

Bumblebees exposed to levels of radiation found within the Chernobyl exclusion zone suffered a “significant” drop in reproduction, in new research published Wednesday that scientists say should prompt a rethink of international calculations of nuclear environmental risk.

The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, set out to discover how ionising radiation affects insects, which are often thought to be more resilient than other species.

Researchers in Scotland and Germany exposed bee colonies in a laboratory setting to a range of radiation levels found in areas of the exclusion zone around the ruined Chernobyl site, where a reactor exploded in 1986 in the world's worst nuclear disaster.

They found that colony reproduction reduced by 30% to 45% at doses previously considered too low to impact insects.

“We found that at radiation levels detectable in Chernobyl, the number of new queen bees produced from the colony was significantly reduced and colony growth was delayed — meaning colonies reached their peak weight at a week later,” said the paper's lead author Katherine Raines.

The lecturer in environmental pollution at the University of Stirling told AFP by email that researchers “anticipate that this may have an effect on pollination/ecosystem services in contaminated areas”.

The authors said they chose bumblebees both because of a lack of lab-based research into bees and because of their crucial role in pollination.

Ionising radiation can occur either from nuclear sites or medical procedures, although the levels tested were higher than those that would likely be found in the environment from normal releases, Raines said.

But she added that the researchers were “very surprised that we could detect effects as low as we did”.

“Our research suggests insects living in the most contaminated areas at Chernobyl may suffer adverse effects, with subsequent consequences for ecosystem services such as pollination,” she added.

The authors said if their findings could be generalised “they suggest insects suffer significant negative consequences at dose rates previously thought safe” and called revisions to the international framework for radiological protection of the environment.

People are not allowed to live near the Chernobyl power station and the abandoned settlements within the exclusion zone are surrounded by forests hosting birds, wolves, elks and lynxes.

405,2020/10/21,Aishwarya Sridhar on what it takes to shoot an award-winning photograph of Indian fireflies,"The 23-year-old photographer-filmmaker on how a posse of endangered fireflies deep inside the Western Ghats made her the first Indian woman to win at Wildlife Photographer of the Year

In June 2019, standing by the side of an old, indigenous plum tree, amid the deep greenery of Bhandardara, Maharashtra, Aishwarya Sridhar stood stock-still, her camera focussed on the hypnotic illumination unfolding before her: Indian fireflies, by the thousands, moving about harmoniously whilst laying forth their magnificent bioluminescence. This moment, forever etched in the young shutterbug’s memory, would take her to newer heights.

What she shot that night in June — the photo titled ‘Lights of Passion’ — fetched Aishwarya the ‘Highly Commended’ award at Wildlife Photographer of the Year Awards under the ‘Behaviour-Invertebrates’ category. Now in its 56th year, the annual international wildlife photography competition is London’s Natural History Museum’s showcase for the world’s best nature photography and is open to photographers of all ages.

Thrilled as she is, the 23-year-old is a little upset that she cannot be in person at the Natural History Museum, London, to see her photograph on display. “I have asked a couple of friends in London to visit the museum and take photos of the display for me,” she says, excitedly.

Bioluminescent marvel

Aishwarya’s interest in fireflies was lit when she came across a newspaper article that spoke of its abundant presence in the Western Ghats. It helped that fireflies, in small numbers, would often fly past the balcony of her home in Panvel, Mumbai. Her research led her to Bhandardara. “Clicking fireflies when the moon is bright is tough because their bioluminescence goes dull,” she says. So, the best time to shoot was in the window before sunrise, just as the moon almost set.

Wildlife photographer Aishwarya Sridhar

With help from locals who guided her to the spot in the jungle, Aishwarya trekked for two-and-a-half-hours in pitch darkness, braving nocturnal species on the prowl. “I spotted a Myrobalan tree which was completely covered in fireflies. It was the first time I had seen fireflies in such huge numbers. I felt like I was standing in the magical world of Harry Potter,” she adds.

She initially took snaps using the longer 100-400mm lens, but was not satisfied with the results. “I was missing out on their flashes because the whole tree wasn’t in the frame. It was tough to focus on the fireflies, and using a torch would have disturbed them. I had to rely on my eyesight to get a precisive shot of the tree,” she says.

Lens view Aishwarya’s image, ‘Lights of Passion’, was selected from among 50,000 entries sent by participants from over 80 countries.

She, however, is no stranger to wildlife documentation having been a filmmaker of Panje — the Last Wetland (2018)

Aishwarya is also a recipient of the Diana Award 2019, given to young change-makers aged nine to 25 by the Royal House, London.

The skies above her were scattered with twinkling stars, and so she decided to create a star trail to frame the fireflies. Using her Canon EOS-1D X Mark II camera and Canon EF16-35mm f/2.8 L II USM lens — at a focal length of 24mm, shutter speed of 24 seconds, f/2.8 and ISO 1000, she snapped 27 consecutive photos, which she later stitched together, post-production. “In other photographs [of fireflies], I didn’t see the juxtaposition of fireflies with the night sky, so that propelled my creative direction,” she says.

Aishwarya — who is also part of the Canon ambassador program as a Canon EOS Explorer — notes that fireflies in India are not photographed as often as is assumed. “Indian fireflies are pretty different from others in the species with respect to bioluminescence. In other countries, you find fireflies make the grasslands their habitat. Here, they make their home on trees,” she says, adding why she is endlessly fascinated with them: “They are stunning ambassadors of Earth’s natural magic. I hope this photograph gets people wanting to explore more about fireflies.”

406,2020/10/21,EU agrees to farm reform with tough new environment rules,"Under the agreement, all farmers will be forced to respect stricter environmental regulations if they want to benefit from financial aid.

European Union ministers agreed Wednesday to overhaul its big budget farm policy with tighter rules to protect the environment and fight climate change.

The new policy adopted by the 27 EU countries will now be the subject of negotiations with the European Parliament, which this week will vote on its own proposals.

“After a long struggle, we have reached a crucial agreement,” German Agriculture Minister Julia Klockner said after two days of talks in Luxembourg. Klockner said there was a “good balance” in achieving a Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) that is “greener, fairer and simpler.”

The member states and members of the European Parliament must decide together between now and next year on rules that will apply starting in January 2023.

The European commissioner for agriculture Janusz Wojciechowski said the deal was “a good starting point” for these negotiations, suggesting a “good compromise” could be reached.

With a budget set for around 387 billion euros over seven years, the CAP accounts for the biggest share of EU spending.

Under the agreement, all farmers will be forced to respect stricter environmental regulations if they want to benefit from financial aid.

Small farms will be subjected to simple checks “which would reduce the administrative burden, while guaranteeing at the same time their contribution to environmental and climate objectives,” it says.

So-called “ecoregimes”, a system of incentives for farmers to apply more stringent environmental standards, would also become compulsory.

Each member state will have to devote at least 20% of EU direct payments to them, with the goal being for farms to receive additional funds if they go over and above the basic norms on climate and the envrionment.

The issue was a cause of friction as many eastern European countries fear losing European funds if an insufficient number of farmers participate in environmental programmes.

“Just a few hours ago we had very different opinions,” Wojciechowski said, adding an agreement is good for farmers who need clarity for planning ahead.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/3024gn/article32907426.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0008TE23N,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/eu-agrees-to-farm-reform-with-tough-new-environment-rules/article32907427.ece
407,2020/10/21,"Coronavirus | AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trial Brazil volunteer dies, trial to continue","Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported that the volunteer had been given a placebo and not the trial vaccine, citing unnamed sources

Brazilian health authority Anvisa said on Wednesday that a volunteer in a clinical trial of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University had died but added that the trial would continue.

Oxford confirmed the plan to keep testing, saying in a statement that after careful assessment “there have been no concerns about safety of the clinical trial.” Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported that the volunteer had been given a placebo and not the trial vaccine, citing unnamed sources.

AstraZeneca declined to comment immediately.

A source familiar with the matter told Reuters the trial would have been suspended if the volunteer who died had received the COVID-19 vaccine, suggesting the person was part of the control group that was given a meningitis jab.

The Federal University of Sao Paulo, which is helping coordinate phase 3 clinical trials in Brazil, said an independent review committee had also recommended the trial continue. The university earlier confirmed the volunteer was Brazilian but gave no further personal details.

“Everything is proceeding as expected, without any record of serious vaccine-related complications involving any of the participating volunteers,” the Brazilian university said in a statement.

So far, 8,000 of the planned 10,000 volunteers in the trial have been recruited and given the first dose in six cities in Brazil, and many have already received the second shot, said a university spokesman.

CNN Brasil reported that the volunteer was a 28-year-old man who lived in Rio de Janeiro and died from COVID-19 complications.

Anvisa provided no further details, citing medical confidentiality of those involved in trials.

Brazil's federal government has plans to purchase the UK vaccine and produce it at biomedical research center FioCruz in Rio de Janeiro, while a competing vaccine from China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd is being tested by Sao Paulo state's research center Butantan Institute.

Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said on Wednesday the federal government will not buy the Sinovac vaccine.

408,2020/10/21,Coronavirus | ‘Infodemic’ management a serious challenge during COVID-19: Soumya Swaminathan,"Led to confusion, risk-taking and ultimately mistrust towards governments, public health response, says WHO Chief Scientist

Managing the “infodemic” has been a serious challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist, World Health Organization (WHO), on Wednesday.

Virtually delivering the 15th JRD Tata Memorial Oration, organised by the Population Foundation of India (PFI) coinciding with its 50th foundation day, she said that even a commonsensical thing to do such as wearing masks has become a polarised debate due to the “infodemic”.

Defining “infodemic” as having too much information, including false or misleading information, particularly on social media, she said that it led to confusion, risk-taking and ultimately mistrust towards governments and the public health response.

She said that the WHO has been working with technology companies to address this challenge by directing the public to credible sources of information, taking down false and misleading information from online platforms, and developing chatbots in different languages that the public could use for accessing information.

Dr. Swaminathan, however, stressed that tackling this was not a straightforward business as it was linked to people’s belief and behaviour.

On ‘shared appointments’

Pointing out the “shared appointments” initiative tried by Aravind Eye Hospital in Puducherry, in which more than one patient with similar problems are provided a consultation at the same time, she said that combining this with telemedicine could bring in a paradigm change.

Highlighting that telemedicine was increasingly being used during COVID-19, she said that shared consultations could provide benefits such as learning from others, higher follow-up rates, and higher compliance to medication.

She said that COVID-19 had exposed existing social inequities and the importance of investing in public and primary health infrastructure. “We see examples of countries where investments in primary healthcare over the past decade or two have paid off,” she said.

She also emphasised the differential impact of the pandemic on women and children, and stressed on the need for governments to focus more on them.

409,2020/10/21,Coronavirus | ICMR approves low-cost testing method developed by IIT Kharagpur,"The machine cost less than ₹5,000 to make and the test kits would each cost about ₹500, IIT-Kharagpur researchers said.

A new coronavirus diagnostic method, using a low-cost portable unit developed by researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, has been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) after testing with patient samples showed an accuracy level slightly lower than the gold standard RT-PCR method at a fraction of the cost.

The machine cost less than ₹5,000 to make and the test kits would each cost about ₹500, IIT-Kharagpur researchers told journalists on Wednesday. Once the viral RNA was extracted, the testing process took about one hour. The IIT was in discussion with commercial manufacturers and start-ups, and hoped that the government would also subsidise the cost of test kits, they said.

In parallel testing with 200 samples containing a wide range of viral loads, IIT-Kharagpur’s COVIRAP method correctly detected 108 out of the 115 positive samples identified by an RT-PCR machine, and 83 out of 85 negative samples, meaning that it has a 94% sensitivity and 98% specificity in comparison to RT-PCR.

“Initially, we were very sceptical, but we were delighted when it worked. The assays are comparable [to RT-PCR],” ICMR virologist Mamta Chawla Sarkar told journalists on Wednesday.

“This assay holds the capability of detecting extremely low levels of viral loads that any other method based on similar principles of testing... In practice, this means that very early stages of infection can be detected, thereby isolating the patient and arresting the uncontrolled spread of infection in the community via asymptomatic patients,” she noted.

Only ₹5,000 to make it

Unlike the RT-PCR machine, which could cost up to ₹25 lakh, and needed to be operated by a molecular biologist, the COVIRAP machine cost the IIT researchers only ₹5,000 to make and could be manufactured at even lower cost if economies of scale were applied by commercial manufacturers, said lead researcher and IIT professor Suman Chakraborty.

‘Ideal for use in rural areas’

“The COVIRAP method requires very little equipment, and is ideal for use in rural areas with limited facilities. The portable unit can even be placed on a table in a field, without the need for an air-conditioned laboratory. It can be operated by rural youth with minimal training,” said Dr. Chakraborty. However, the viral RNA would still have to be extracted in a lab.

The machine employed an isothermal nucleic acid amplification method, which did away with need for a thermocycler, he said. Once the sample was processed in the machine after being mixed with solutions developed by the IIT team, treated paper strips -- similar to the pregnancy strips -- are dipped into it, and the emergence of coloured lines will depict the presence of the virus. A mobile app has been developed to analyse the strips placed in a hand-held unit, in order to minimise human error.

Isothermal nucleic acid amplification employs an approach similar to one in RT-PCR and has its advantages and disadvantages. Other laboratories, including those of the CSIR (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research) and the Department of Science and Technology have designed devices based on this approach but none yet have been cleared by the ICMR and reached the stage of commercial manufacturing.

FELUDA test

FELUDA, a kit developed by the CSIR-IGIB (Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology), also is a ‘paper strip based test’ but employs a gene editing technology called CRISPR-cas9. Like COVIRAP, it too claims to deliver results in an hour--as compared to 3-4 hours in an RT-PCR-- but are ultimately laboratory based tests and depend on skilled personnel to extract the nucleic acid RNA from a nasopharyengal sample prior to the actual testing. FELUDA, cleared by the Drug Controller General of India and the ICMR, has been licensed to Tata Sons and is expected to be commercially available later this month.

410,2020/10/21,"Research shows evidence of a river flowing through the Thar Desert 172,000 years ago","The presence of a river running through the central Thar Desert would have offered a life-line to Paleolithic populations, and potentially an important corridor for migrations

Researchers have found the evidence of river activity in central Thar Desert, near Bikaner, as early as 172 thousand years ago, and may have been a life-line to human populations enabling them to inhabit the region.

The findings, published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, represent the oldest directly dated phase of river activity at Nal Quarry in the central Thar Desert.

The study by researchers from The Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany, Anna University in Tamil Nadu, and IISER Kolkata indicates that Stone Age populations lived in a distinctly different Thar Desert landscape than we encounter today.

This evidence indicates a river flowed with phases of activity dating to approximately up to 172 thousand years ago, nearby to Bikaner, Rajasthan, which is over 200 kilometres away from the nearest modern river. These findings predate evidence for activity in modern river courses across the Thar Desert as well as dried up course of the Ghaggar-Hakra River, the researchers said.

The presence of a river running through the central Thar Desert would have offered a life-line to Paleolithic populations, and potentially an important corridor for migrations, they said.

Different phases of river activity

“The Thar Desert has a rich prehistory, and we’ve been uncovering a wide range of evidence showing how Stone Age populations not only survived but thrived in these semi-arid landscapes,” said Jimbob Blinkhorn from The Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. “We know how important rivers can be to living in this region, but we have little detail on what river systems were like during key periods of prehistory.”

Studies of satellite imagery have shown a dense network of river channels crossing the Thar Desert, according to the researchers.

“These studies can indicate where rivers and streams have flowed in the past, but they can’t tell us when,” explained Professor Hema Achyuthan of Anna University. “To demonstrate how old such channels are, we had to find evidence on the ground for river activity in the middle of the desert.”

The team studied a deep deposit of river sands and gravels, which had been exposed by quarrying activity near the village of Nal. The researchers were able to document different phases of river activity by studying the different deposits.

“We immediately saw evidence for a substantial and very active river system from the bottom of the fluvial deposits, which gradually decreased in power through time,” Achyuthan said.

Luminescence dating

The researchers used a method called luminescence dating to understand when quartz grains in the river sands were buried.

The results indicated that the strongest river activity at Nal occurred at approximately 172 and 140 thousand years ago, at a time when the monsoon was much weaker than today in the region.

River activity continued at the site between 95 to 78 thousand years ago, after which only limited evidence for the presence of a river at the site, with evidence for a brief reactivation of the channel 26 thousand years ago, the study found.

The river was flowing at its strongest during a phase of weak monsoonal activity in the region, and may have been a life-line to human populations enabling them to inhabit the Thar Desert, the researchers said.

The timeframe over which this river was active also overlaps with significant changes in human behaviour in the region, which have been linked with the earliest expansions of Homo sapiens from Africa into India, they said.

“This river flowed at a critical timeframe for understanding human evolution in the Thar Desert, across South Asia and beyond,” said Blinkhorn. “This suggests a landscape in which the earliest members of our own species, Homo sapiens, first encountered the monsoons and crossed the Thar Desert may have been very different to the landscape we can see today.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ia7xy7/article32908088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/research-shows-evidence-of-a-river-flowing-through-the-thar-desert-172000-years-ago/article32908090.ece
411,2020/10/21,NASA spacecraft grabs sample of rocks from asteroid Bennu,"Located over 100 million miles from Earth Bennu could hold clues to the origins of life on Earth, scientists say.

A NASA spacecraft touched down on the rugged surface of the Bennu asteroid on Tuesday, grabbing a sample of rocks dating back to the birth of our solar system to bring home.

The minivan-sized OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, built by Lockheed Martin, extended its 11-foot robotic arm toward a flat patch of gravel near Bennus north pole and plucked the sample of rocks, the space agency's first handful of pristine asteroid rocks.

“Sample collection is complete, and the back-away burn has executed,” Lockheed mission operator Estelle Church added seconds later, confirming the spacecraft eased away from the space rock after making contact.

The probe will send back images of the sample collection on Wednesday and throughout the week so scientists can examine how much material was retrieved and determine whether the probe will need to make another collection attempt.

If a successful collection is confirmed, the spacecraft will journey back toward Earth, arriving in 2023. Japan is the only other country to have already accomplished this.

Bennu, located over 100 million miles from Earth and whose acorn-shaped body formed in the early days of our solar system, could hold clues to the origins of life on Earth, scientists say. “Everything went just exactly perfect,” Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator from the University of Arizona, Tucson, said on a NASA live feed from Lockheed's mission support building. “We have overcome the amazing challenges that this asteroid has thrown at us, and the spacecraft appears to have operated flawlessly.”

The robotic arm's collection device, shaped like an oversized shower head, is designed to release a pressurized gas to kick up debris.

The spacecraft launched in 2016 from Kennedy Space Center for the journey to Bennu. It has been in orbit around the asteroid for nearly two years preparing for the touch and go maneuver.

Asteroids are among the leftover debris from the solar systems formation some 4.5 billion years ago. Scientists believe asteroids and comets crashing into early Earth may have delivered organic compounds and water that seeded the planet for life. Atomic-level analysis of samples from Bennu could provide key evidence to support that hypothesis.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/t8pltw/article32906589.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ekzir78XYAENuE5,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/nasa-spacecraft-grabs-sample-of-rocks-from-asteroid-bennu/article32906590.ece
