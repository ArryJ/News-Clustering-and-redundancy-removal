1,2020/10/24,Tokyo opens its Olympic swimming venue,"City governor says all venues have been readied for hosting the event.

Tokyo opened its new Olympic swimming venue on Saturday, and Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike pointed out that it was finished eight months ago, just weeks before the Tokyo Olympics were postponed until next year by the coronavirus.

We have now completed all the new venues, Ms. Koike said.

Now comes the hard part for Tokyo Olympic organisers: figuring out how to run the Olympics, nine months from now, in the middle of a pandemic. The Games are set to open on July 23, 2021.

Tokyo officials and the International Olympic Committee have been studying contingencies for months. But it may not be until next year that they reveal exactly how the Olympics can be pulled off.

How will 15,400 Olympic and Paralympic athletes from more than 200 nations and territories safely enter Japan? Add to this, thousands of officials, judges, media, broadcasters, sponsors, and VIPs.

Not to mention fans. Will it be only Japanese, or will non-Japanese be allowed in? It’s stable for the time being, Ms. Koike said, speaking of Japan were about 1,700 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.

“We would like to receive more athletes and more people from the outside,” she said.

The 15,000-seat swimming venue sits just off Tokyo Bay. It’s cost is listed at $520 million, which makes it the second-most expensive venue after the $1.43 billion national stadium.

Tokyo organisers say they are spending $12.6 billion to conduct the Olympics, although a national audit says the cost is twice that much.

Last month a University of Oxford study called Tokyo the most expensive Summer Olympics on record.

Among the first to swim a lap in the pool on Saturday was Rikako Ikee, who won six gold medals at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Ikee would have been among the favorites for several medals in Tokyo, but she was diagnosed with leukemia over a year ago. She has undergone treatment and is hopeful of qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympics.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/husxej/article32935894.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THTOKYOOLYMPICSSWIMMINGPOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/tokyo-opens-its-olympic-swimming-venue/article32935895.ece
2,2020/10/24,Tit for tat,"Any sense is there in this? It is like wearing shirt-pant, then putting swimming trunks on top because what if suddenly swimming mood is coming?

Respected Madam/Sir,

Insulting means there are rules or no? You go to other people’s house, ok they can insult you. Fine. You meet somebody outside in park. Enjoy and insult each other, it is free country. But when somebody comes to house? Then? Whether you must get insulted? Never. It is called common courtesy. But these days where is time for common courtesy and all.

What is the timetable of youths these days? 10 a.m.: Breakfast. 11 a.m.-2 p.m.: Dance like buffoons on TikTok type app. 2 p.m.-4 p.m.: Come to Mathrubootham house and do insulting talks. 4 p.m.-8 p.m.: Fight with other youths about international matters on Twitter as if UN General Secretary has personally asked for inputs. 9 p.m.: Dinner. 10 p.m.: Sit outside in public place wearing white earphones hanging from ear as if infection is there, but whether listening to music? Never. Just sitting and doing talks with other youths.

Any sense is there in this? It is like wearing shirt-pant, then putting swimming trunks on top because what if suddenly swimming mood is coming?

Why suddenly Mathrubootham is shouting about youths? I will explain. Listen carefully and please circulate amongst youths in your office.

Two-three days ago Mrs. Mathrubootham is suddenly entering the living room and destroying all peace of mind like Mukesh Ambani entering new industry. She said, please keep house clean at 4 p.m. ok? I said what nonsense Kamalam, house is already clean. She said, old man I just found four banana peels behind the bed. One peel maybe from 1995. Whether you will listen? Never. Better to throw maida at one chicken and wait for egg puffs.

I said, Kamalam ok fine, I will clean the house, long time we have not tried mutta puff? She said, if you clean I will consider. I asked who is coming at 4 p.m.? She said nephew of Ladies Association member is coming to wait in our flat till lady returns from meeting. I said one prayer to Tirupati Balaji and carefully removed two banana peel and one apple core from under sofa.

Sharp 4 p.m. who came to the house? Nobody. Rascal fellow is coming at 4:25 p.m. I said welcome. Please relax. Books is there. DVD is there. TV is there. Please enjoy. He looked at books and said, uncle you are still reading Alastair Maclean? Whether you have any new thrillers written after 1980s? I said hahaha, young man, this and all are classic novels.

Then he went to DVD stand and after 10 minutes came back and said whether I am watching any popular movies or only rare type films. I said, what abhisekham of nonsense you are pouring over my head fellow? Spartacus is rare type film? Zorba The Greek is rare film? Raise the Titanic? What films you are watching?

He said uncle have you seen Christopher Nolan films? Or read books by Knausgaard? Or maybe essay by David Sedaris?

Just as my hand is reaching for flower vase, Kamalam came and said, old man, please go and purchase mutta puffs. I said ok. I asked the boy hello, whether you want mutta puffs? He said no, he has not touched maida since 5-6 years.

Ten minutes later three of us are sitting in dining room. Kamalam and myself eating puffs with tomato sauce. Boy sitting and looking. I can see the water in his mouth. He asked, how is the puff? Kamalam said kanna you want to try one?

Before he could reply, I said Kamalam what nonsense he cannot eat this. I went to the kitchen and came back with banana and apple and put in front of him. Then I quietly sat and ate mutta puffs in slow motion as if perfume advertisement.

Yours in revenge,

Bihar Assembly elections | Tejashwi Yadav narrows gap as confusion plagues NDA

Mr. Yadav, heir apparent of RJD chief Lalu Prasad and CM face of the party, may not be the first choice of the voters but he appears to be giving a tough challenge to the Nitish Kumar-led NDA, largely because of strong anti-incumbency wave across the State.

Bihar Assembly elections | Millennial politicians are determined to take over reins, says Prof Ashwani Kumar

Professor Ashwani Kumar, political scientist at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, speaks to The Hindu on why the upcoming Assembly polls in Bihar are different from the last 45 years and herald a new epoch in State politics.

The BJP has accused the Congress of employing “selective outrage” in cases of crimes against women, questioning the silence of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra over the alleged rape and murder of a six-year-old girl in Punjab.

At Akbarpur Raina village in Gulaothi block of Bulandshahr, Chanderpal Singh Jatav is unequivocal in his assessment of BSP supremo Mayawati. She should “retire”, he says, and make way for Chandrashekhar Azad as he could “protect Dalit pride” as she once did.

Latest recoveries have exceeded the fresh cases in the recent days, with 67,549 COVID-19 patients having recovered and discharged in the last 24 hours.

Azerbaijan's Defence Ministry reported fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh.

Banks and other lenders have been asked to credit the difference between the compound interest and simple interest for the six month period between March 1 and August 31 into these loan accounts by November 5.

The company’s comment came following a hearing by a Joint Committee of Parliament on Data Protection Bill, 2019.

5,2020/10/24,Bihar Assembly elections | Result crucial to Congress revival,"Leadership issue hinges on poll tally

The Congress may be the junior partner in the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led alliance in Bihar but its performance in the Hindi heartland State could play an important role in the party’s revival plan.

Amidst a renewed call for Rahul Gandhi to take over as the Congress chief once again, the election could well be a litmus test for Mr. Gandhi, the principal campaigner for his party.

It could also set the tone for the party’s campaign for the next round of Assembly elections, expected around April-May next year, in crucial States such as West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and the Union Territory of Puducherry.

“These elections come at a time of churn within the Congress. The party plans to have a full-time president next year and if it does well and improves on its previous tally, Mr. Gandhi may become the natural unanimous choice. But if that’s not the case, then there will be challenge as senior leaders had recently written about the leadership question,” said Professor Sri Prakash Singh, Department of Politics, Delhi University.

In the 2015 Assembly elections, the Congress had its best performance in nearly two decades. Of the 41 seats it contested as part of the grand alliance between the RJD and Nitish Kumar Janata Dal-United (JD-U), the party won 27 seats.

The unexpected results were meant to be a trigger to revive the party in the Hindi heartland where it had lost out to leaders such as Lalu Yadav, Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan — all products of JP [Jayaprakash Narayan] movement — and their brand of politics at social re-engineering.

But far from it, the then Bihar Congress chief, Ashok Choudhury, switched sides when JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) by parting ways with the RJD and the Congress.

Dependent on alliance

“The party at the State level as well as the central level only relies on alliances. Congress workers mostly carry on with routine political activity and become visible only during the elections,” said K.K. Jha, a member of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) from Bihar.

“There were so many issues. From 15 years of anti-incumbency to the collapse of the health and education system, the Congress should have emerged as the main voice of the people. Nearly 200 children died from encephalitis in Muzaffarpur but we could not hold the government accountable. Since it has become a habit of sorts to depend on alliances, our State leaders failed to raise issues strongly,” Mr. Jha added.

No voter base

In these elections, of the 243 Assembly seats, the Congress has fielded candidates in 70 constituencies. But the party can hardly boast of a strong organisation on the ground or winnable candidates.

“While the RJD has its Yadav and Muslim voter base intact, the Congress does not have a voter base or an organisation on the ground. And they have also not been able to reach out to any particular group like the Brahmins and Dalits, who used to be their traditional voters,” Professor Singh said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/iq0x3/article32937413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THRDRAHUL22,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-elections-result-crucial-to-congress-revival/article32937414.ece
6,2020/10/24,Analysis | Tejashwi Yadav narrows gap as confusion plagues NDA,"While the Nitish Kumar led ruling alliance retains the edge, the UPA is gaining ground

Barely a month back, the Bihar Assembly election seemed a walk over for the NDA comprising four allies — BJP, JD(U), Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and Vikasheel Insaan Party.

However, as the campaign gained momentum just two weeks back, each day seems to see the opposition UPA, led by RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, gaining round with a large turnout of voters at his poll meetings.

Mr. Tejashwi Yadav, heir apparent of RJD chief Lalu Prasad and chief ministerial face of the party, may not be the first choice of the voters but he appears to be giving a tough challenge to the Nitish Kumar-led NDA, largely because of strong anti-incumbency wave across the State.

In parts of south and central Bihar, the mood of the voters reflected more an anti-Nitish Kumar sentiment than a pro-Tejashwi Yadav mood. Across castes and constituencies, people were vocal in their ire against the Chief Minister rather than rooting for the RJD leader.

Despite the top BJP leadership reiterating its support from Mr. Kumar as the face of the NDA and the inclusion of all allies, , party workers at grassroots are confused and many disinterested in campaigning for non-BJP candidates.

In Dinara, Paliganj, Bikram and Sasaram constituencies, the local BJP workers were seen campaigning covertly for the rebel party candidates contesting the poll on the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) ticket.

Also read | Bihar Assembly elections | Tejashwi ready to contest from Nitish home turf Nalanda

This dovetails with LJP chief Chirag Paswan’s aggressive opposition to the Chief Minister, and his fielding candidates on 143 seats, mostly against JD(U) nominees. Though the BJP has been at pains to clarify that the LJP is not a part of the NDA in Bihar, at the Centre the party still is very much part of the NDA. This has led to confusion among grass root BJP workers on whether to support the official NDA candidate or the popular but rebel party leaders contesting on LJP ticket.

Even if the LJP doesn’t win more seats, it is likely to damage the JD(U). A weaker JD(U) will, for the first time, be forced to rely on the BJP in the State.

Also read | Tejashwi Yadav takes a swipe at Nitish

Another cause for worry for Mr. Nitish Kumar is that the Extremely Backward Castes (28-30% of the total population of the State) which he had, meticulously carved out from the OBCs to ensure that he stayed in power for last 15 years, also seem to be disenchanted with him.

The unhappiness stems from two reasons: first, corruption, mostly at lower levels of bureaucracy, police and officials implementing Mr. Kumar’s welfare projects like the Saat Nischay (seven resolves); second, prohibition which has done more damage than good to them unlike the claims of Mr. Kumar. Adding to their anger is Mr. Kumar’s recent “insensitive” handling of the issue of migrant workers forced to return home during lockdown.

Also read | Tejashwi Yadav’s apology for ‘mistakes’ of RJD regime fails to impress Bihar’s ruling NDA

However, voters’ ire is not against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and they are keen to have a BJP CM in the State for once. For that to happen, the BJP needs to get around 90-95 seats and the JD(U) at least 40.

The confused signals from the ruling alliance seem to be working in favour of 31-year-old Mr. Tejashwi Yadav, who is banking on the RJD’s solid M-Y (Muslims-Yadavs) vote of nearly 31%. This could win him around 70-75 seats. And with a little add on from alliance partners, the number for the UPA could go over 100.

UPA allies have also hit the ground with the Congress working hard on at least 40 out of the total 70 seats that it is contesting and among the three Left parties in the block, the CPI(M-L) appeared to be on strong footing in nearly 10 seats out of total 19 it is contesting. Besides, Mr. Yadav’s promise of 10 lakh government jobs now seems to be resonating among youths more than Nitish Kumar or, the State BJP leaders would care to admit.

7,2020/10/24,"Bihar Assembly elections | RJD manifesto promises 10 lakh jobs, farm loan waiver","The Rashtriya Janata Dal announced that it would give priority to agriculture, industry and education if voted to power.

Rashtriya Janata Dal, which heads the opposition Grand Alliance coalition in the Bihar elections, released its poll manifesto Saturday reiterating its promise of 10 lakh jobs and loan waiver for the farmers.

The manifesto was released by Tejashwi Yadav at a press conference in the party office here.

The cover page of the manifesto displays photographs of Mahatma Gandhi, Dalits icon BR Ambedkar, freedom fighter Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, socialist veterans Ram Manohar Lohia and Karpoori Thakur, Loknayak Jayprakash Narayan among others, but it does not have a photo of the party’s founder and its charismatic leader Lalu Prasad.

Mr Tejshwi’s photo finds a prominent space on the cover page.

There is a message from Mr Prasad in the document in which he highlighted how his party government in the past fought the battle to ensure social justice for the downtroddens and brought Bihar back on the path of development.

Mr Prasad, who is in jail in Ranchi after his conviction in four cases of multi-crore rupees fodder scam, also made a scathing attack on rival NDA government in the State, saying, “there is no jobs, atrocities against women have increased and happiness is missing from the face of farmers”.

While emphasising on its future plans for the State if voted to power, the RJD vision document also hit out at the Bharatiya Janata Party for trying to “fool people” by announcing 19 lakh jobs in the State.

“Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been raising doubts on our promise of providing 10 lakh jobs, so how will his future government fulfill ally BJP’s declaration of 19 lakh jobs?” Mr Tejashwi asked.

The RJD announced that it would give priority to agriculture, industry and education if voted to power.

The opposition chief ministerial candidate accompanied by State party president Jagdanad Singh and its national spokesman Manoj Jha, reitereted “we will give 10 lakh jobs.”

Replying to Mr Kumar’s queries about source of finance for the 10 lakh jobs, Mr Tejashwi said the State’s annual budget is of ₹ 2.5 lakh crore “out of which his (Kumar) government is able to spend only 60 per cent of the budget, the rest around 80,000 crore can be utilised by a competent government for people’s welfare.”

The RJD’s manifesto stressed on increasing income of farmers and waiving KCC (Kisan Credit Card) loan taken by the cultivators till 2020.

It also vowed to purchase grains from the farmers at an enhanced Minimum Support Price that would include bonus.

Education

In the field of education, it promised to fill vacancies of teachers in schools on a war-footing.

It further declared that the party headed future government would increase budget on education to 22 per cent of the total budget.

Mr Tejashwi said that if voted to power they would promote investment into the State for setting up industries so that citizens of the State are not forced to migrate outside.

The RJD also promised computer training to the citizens in every panchayat free of cost.

International level sports university would also be established in the State, the RJD manifesto said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/91rbn5/article32936384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YADAVKB,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-elections-rjd-manifesto-promises-10-lakh-jobs-farm-loan-waiver/article32936385.ece
8,2020/10/24,Bihar Assembly elections | This independent candidate gets a leg-up from Jean Dreze,"Belgian-born economist has been camping in village to support MGNREGA activist Sanjay Sahni

The poll campaign in the Kurhani Assembly constituency of Muzaffarpur district is similar to that in the other 243 constituencies of Bihar, except that noted economist Jean Dreze and a group of student volunteers from different parts of the country have been camping in a village for the last 10 days to support Independent candidate Sanjay Sahni.

Mr. Sahni, a class VII dropout, is a popular MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) activist in the area and closely associated with the Belgian-born Indian economist and social scientist Mr. Dreze, RTI activists Nikhil Dey, Aruna Roy and others.

Along with Mr. Dreze, a group of eight student volunteers from Hyderabad, Bangalore, Delhi, Jharkhand and Bihar too have come to root for Mr. Sahni in the election.

Every day, braving the sultry climate and the scorching sun, students Xara Khan, Shailja Tondon, Achyuthan, Vipul, Anil Vyom, Nikhil and Piyush Fozan hit the dusty village tracks along with Mr. Sahni and a group of village women for campaign in the constituency dominated by Scheduled Castes and Extremely Backward Caste people.

Mr. Dreze too accompanies them sometimes but mostly stays at the camp office handling strategy and social media for the candidate.

“The sheer energy of the candidate and of the young student volunteers is inspiring…here you can see democracy in action with the participation of poor and disadvantaged people in the campaign”, Mr. Dreze told The Hindu when asked why he had come to this remote place in Bihar to campaign for a candidate contesting Assembly elections.

Ms. Tondon, who studied at JNU and now works at the Centre for Social Sciences and Humanities in Delhi, and Ms. Khan, a fresh pass-out from Rishi Valley School in Hyderabad, travel several kilometres daily on their foot to be with the village’s women campaigners and guide them from time to time to cover their faces with mask.

“The reason I chose to come to Kurhani to campaign for Sanjayji is because I want to be part of a counter-movement against the systematic attack on democracy”, said Ms. Tandon, while for Ms. Khan “it was an opportunity to absorb the women campaigners’ strength and hope for future struggles”.

“I’ve never participated in any political campaign before…also when I read Jean’s latest book Sense and Solidarity and came to know that he is coming here for campaign, I couldn’t resist coming here for the campaign, though my parents were a bit scared for me”, said 17-year-old Ms. Khan, wiping beads of sweat from her forehead with her stole wrapped tightly around her face.

Mr. Achyuthan, Mr. Fozan and Mr. Nikhil too are with them learning “new ropes of democracy”. They do not want any change in Bihar’s governance but a “transformation” that could eventually bring out structural changes in society.

Mr. Dreze and Mr. Vyom are at the camp office at Mahant-Maniyari in Ratnauli village of the constituency to analyse data, be in touch with people on social media and welcome the visitors as well.

The local villagers are amused to see a foreigner speaking in Hindi and staying put with them 24x7 for the last 10 days. They know that Mr. Dreze is a famous economist but do not know about his contribution to the MGNREGA.

“Yes, we know him…he is a very famous eekonomisst of the country…students from big cities of rich families too have come to support Sanjay Sahni, a local lad who has been working for us to get our right to work under MGNREGA for last several years”, said Anita Devi, Mandeshri Devi and Indu Devi at Mahant Maniyari village.

Sanjay Sahni, in his mid-thirties, too feels proud and honoured that he is getting support from Mr. Dreze and the student volunteers for campaign. “Though I’ve have been working with Jean Dreze and other activists like Nikhil Dey, Aruna Roy and others, I had not imagined that they would come here to be with me for my campaign”, Mr. Sahni said, while campaigning in Rampur village.

Since 2013, Mr. Sahni runs a group named Samaj Parivartan Shakti Sangathan for villagers to get their right to work under the MGNREGA and ration under Public Distribution System (PDS) in Kurhani block of the district.

Earlier, he was working as an electrician and had a stall on the pavement of Janakpuri area of Delhi.

One day, in August 2011, he strayed into a cyber café on the other side of the road and typed “NREGA Bihar” and the search engine gave him all the details of MGNREGA related to his village, Ratnauli. “I had heard that if you type anything on Google, you would find the answer”, he said. Later, armed with the printouts, he returned to his village to confront the local authorities for gross misuse, scam and fabrication in numbers and payments to the innocent villagers.

“People are now aware of their rights and have learnt to question authorities about their rights”, he said, flashing a smile on his face.

The Kurhani constituency is steeped in poverty and the majority of people are poor and downtrodden.

“Do you know your rights now? …will you allow contractors and mukhias (village heads) to deny you work under MGNREGA and ration under PDS like they used to earlier?”, Mr. Sahni asked a gathering of mostly women.

“No,” they said in chorus.

But, what will be Mr. Sahni’s first task, if he wins the poll? “I’ll open a help centre at the Kurhani block office where all work will be done for the villagers at one desk”, he said quickly.

“This gives me faith in a candidate like Sanjay Sahni who is keeping the democratic values alive…people like him must be in our Assembly to help us make progress as a State”, said Mr. Dreze.

Mr. Sahni is pitted against sitting NDA candidate Kedar Gupta (BJP) and RJD nominee Anil Sahni.

9,2020/10/24,"Bihar Assembly elections | Millennial politicians are determined to take over reins, says Prof Ashwani Kumar","They are locally influential and drawing huge crowds to their political rallies, he says

Professor Ashwani Kumar, political scientist at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, speaks to The Hindu on why the upcoming Assembly polls in Bihar are different from the last 45 years and herald a new epoch in State politics.

The Bihar polls were considered a slam dunk but a spirited campaign and clever positioning by Tejashwi Yadav and Chirag Paswan seem to have made the contest interesting. Your take?

The Bihar Assembly elections promise to be historic in many ways. Whatever be the outcome of the elections, the ageing political patriarchs from the days of Total Revolution (Sampurna Kranti) are set to fade into history; it is the last election with regard to those who came up in the Emergency and Mandal.

If the 2005 elections were about Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) misrule, 2010 was a victory of Nitish Kumar’s ‘vikas’, and 2015 resonated with the return of Mandal titans Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar in ‘Naya Bihar’. The Assembly elections of 2020 will be the last polls of the older generation of socialist leaders in Bihar.

With Lalu Prasad in absentia, Ram Vilas Paswan deceased and the ageing Nitish Kumar facing the toughest political challenge of his life, Bihar is on the cusp of an improbable youth insurgency. Refusing to play the secondary role in the making of new Bihar, the starry-eyed upwardly mobile millennial politicians Tejashwi Yadav, 30; Chirag Paswan, 37; Mukesh Sahani, 35; Shreyasi Singh, 29; Garib Das, 26; Pushpam Priya Choudhary, 28; Sandeep Saurabh, 32, and many others, including fire-brand student leader Kanhaiya Kumar, are determined to take over the reins in a post-clientilsitic Bihar.

Also, there is something novel here — these millennial young politicos or their cohorts belonging to subaltern groups point to further democratisation of politics, as a new youth elite has emerged through the resilient post-Mandal politics in Bihar.

Many of whom you have named are political dynasts and inheritors, so what is new in this youthful politics?

Unlike their famous fathers, who inherited the legacies of caste, rural and feudal experiences, these neo-dynasts are savvy with social media, electoral rhetoric and also conjure up an image of aspirational India. Demographically speaking, Bihar is a State with 80 million (65%) youth population, and it is home to a large proportion (58%) of youth, below the age of 25. This demographic reality is reflected in the electorate, as there are as many as 56% voters in Bihar in the 18-40 age group among the 7.6 crore voters in Bihar.

In other words, Bihar’s politics stands transformed by millennials and their generational cohorts. The four north Indian States of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have seen median ages fall, while the South is greying; this will have an impact and is having one within the established political parties too.

How is the leadership within parties changing in Bihar?

This unexpected youth insurgency has impacted all political parties and has initiated what is termed as a “demographic electoral shift in leadership”. Older-generation BJP leaders like Sushil Modi, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Nand Kishore Yadav, Giriraj Singh are pitted against the rising new-generation stars like Nityanand Rai. Likewise, veteran Congress party leaders like Sadananda Singh, Madan Mohan Jha, Aditya Singh have handed over their pocket borough to the next generation sons and daughters.

Schooled in the old grammar of patronage and caste, Upendra Kushwaha of Rashtriya Samata Party (RLSP) and Pappu Yadav of Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) are also facing the heat of gravitational force of rising youth. Interestingly, the older generation of bahubali politicians like Anant Singh, Sunil Pandey, Surendra Yadav continue to be in the electoral fray, but Anand Mohan Singh’s 29-year-old Chetan Anand is contesting Shivhar seat on RJD ticket, signalling a generational shift even in the mafioso politics in Bihar.

That sounds like a regular generational shift that’s happened in the past, how is it different from others?

Strauss and Howe, the demographers who coined the term ‘millennials,’ have identified some core traits of them. Millennials, including post-millennials and Gen Z, consider themselves special, both as individuals and as a group. They are confident, tech-savvy, meritocratic, high-achieving, team-oriented and pressured to succeed even if it means donning the role of potential hackers of systems. And they are practical, entrepreneurial, and digitally networked than their more austere, risk-averse parents.

Paradoxical as it might sound, they are not nationally powerful politicians as yet but they are locally influential, drawing huge crowds to their political rallies, and changing the local political equations and coalitions. Given his administrative experience as youngest former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, Tejashwi has excited the imagination of voters by his ‘million jobs’ pledge. With his audacious and strategic decision to part company with JD,U) while retaining the NDA, Chirag has invoked the powerful slogan of ‘Bihar First, Bihari First,’ making the Bihar elections truly aspirational and open-ended.

Nitish Kumar is credited with bringing in some development to Bihar, yet he is facing strong anti-incumbency in the State. How do you square that with an “aspirational youth”?

Success begets its own enemies. Call it ‘revolution of rising expectations’ or ‘demographic revolt’ of the millennial generation, Nitish Kumar’s roads, electricity and transport etc have become passé in such a short time. People, especially the post-millennial generation youth, men and women, have no living memories of so-called ‘Jungle raj,’ kidnappings or caste militias like Ranvir Sena.

They want aspirational new-age goodies like smartphones, free WIFI, dating games, smart classrooms, gig economy jobs, and also wish to shed the tag of lowly migrant workers. This is where Nitish Kumar has been found wanting by the aspirational generation. And it is here the BJP has done better than the JD,U). By projecting Prime Minister Modi as the star campaigner, the BJP has insulated itself from the anti-incumbency backlash of younger generation and it is hoping to cash in on millennials’ aspirations and disaffections.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xrhfxi/article32935784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Aswani-kumarjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-elections-millennial-politicians-are-determined-to-take-over-reins-says-prof-ashwani-kumar/article32935828.ece
10,2020/10/24,"U.S. allies welcome Israel-Sudan deal; Iran, Palestine cry foul","Sudan is the third Arab govt. to reset ties in last two months

Sudan and Israel agreed on Friday to normalise relations, in a U.S.-brokered deal to end decades of hostility that was widely welcomed but stirred Palestinian anger.

The announcement makes Sudan, technically at war with Israel since its 1948 foundation, the third Arab country to forge diplomatic relations with the Jewish state in the last two months.

“HUGE win today for the United States and for peace in the world,” U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted.

Other U.S. allies, including Germany, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, welcomed the deal as a boost to stability in the West Asia.

Meanwhile, Palestinian leaders strongly condemned the deal, echoing their rejection of Israel’s normalisation accords with the UAE and Bahrain signed in Washington last month.

“The State of Palestine expressed today its condemnation and rejection of the deal to normalise ties with the Israeli occupation country which usurps Palestinian land,” president Mahmoud Abbas’s office said in a statement.

Iran, which has been a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause, said Sudan had paid a “shameful” price to be removed from the “phony” blacklist.

“Pay enough ransom, close your eyes on the crimes against Palestinians, then you’ll be taken off the so-called ‘terrorism’ blacklist. Obviously the list is as phony as the U.S. fight against terrorism.

11,2020/10/24,Coronavirus | Countries battle COVID-19 as WHO sees ‘exponential’ rise,"U.S. reported 80,000 cases in a day; France extends curfew

Grim data highlighted the struggle for authorities around the world to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control on Saturday, as the U.S. reported 80,000 infections in a single day, France extended a curfew to two-thirds of citizens and Germany’s death toll passed 10,000.

The World Health Organization had earlier warned of an “exponential” rise in infections threatening health systems’ ability to cope.

Clashes over restrictions

But populations weary of social isolation and economic hardship have pushed back against fresh restrictions to slow the resurgent virus’ spread, including overnight clashes in hard-hit Naples between Italian police and hundreds of protesters.

In the U.S., COVID-19 has become a central election issue ahead of a November 3 vote, with President Donald Trump on Friday promising attendees at a Florida rally that “we’re going to quickly end this pandemic, this horrible plague.”

Meanwhile, challenger Joe Biden matched Mr. Trump’s vow to make a vaccine available for free to all who want it “whether or not you’re insured” and said the Republican incumbent has “given up” on controlling the outbreak.

Johns Hopkins University had earlier reported 79,963 new American cases in 24 hours, a new record, although the number of daily deaths has remained broadly stable since the beginning of autumn at between 700 and 800.

Overall, more than 2,23,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S.

France on Friday followed Spain past the milestone of one million cases, while the government extended an overnight curfew designed to slow the spread to affect some 46 million people.

And after Germany recorded its 10,000th death from the novel coronavirus, Chancellor Angela Merkel told citizens that “the order of the day is to reduce contacts, to meet as few people as possible” in a weekly video podcast.

In Poland, President Andrzej Duda tested positive for COVID-19.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned that “too many countries are seeing an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases and that is now leading to hospitals and intensive care units running close to or above capacity — and we’re still only in October.”

Across the world, COVID-19 has claimed the lives of 1.1 million people and infected close to 42 million, with the WHO warning the northern hemisphere was at a critical juncture.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mtiv06/article32937582.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-TOPSHOT-GERMANY-HEALTH-VIRUS-GASTRONOMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-countries-battle-covid-19-as-who-sees-exponential-rise/article32937584.ece
12,2020/10/24,"Once U.S. leaves, Pakistan will gain more space in Afghanistan, says Ata Mohammad Noor","Former Balkh Governor warns of the developing security situation in country

A debt he had to repay. That’s what senior Afghan leader and former Governor of Balkh province Ata Mohammad Noor says he thought when he first heard the news that terrorists had attacked the Indian Consulate in his capital of Mazar-e-Sharif in January 2016. Within minutes, the Governor had picked up his M-4 carbine (rifle) himself and rushed to the scene with his guards to defend the Indian diplomats trapped inside the Consulate from the gunmen shooting at them from a building nearby.

“We never forgot what India did for us. When many other countries were supporting the terrorists and the Taliban, India supported the Northern Alliance,” he said, recounting the attack during his visit to Delhi this week. “As Governor, I might have had 10,000 soldiers, but I felt it was my personal responsibility to repay India for the hospitality we had received then,” he said, referring to how India had given Northern Alliance fighters shelter, medical aid and logistical support during the 1990s, when he fought as part of the Mujahideen alongside Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Masood to overthrow the Taliban in 2001.

Operations lasted for more than 24 hours, during which Mr. Noor led his forces, firing at the building that housed the three terrorists to stop them from escaping. All three terrorists, believed to to be militants from the ‘Afzal brigade’ of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), were killed.

The siege that had begun at the same time as the JeM attack on the Pathankot air base in India, came just a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to Kabul and Lahore. “A dangerous and deadly group was sent by Pakistan, and we dispatched them,” Mr. Noor said in Farsi, using the word “Khatarnak” to describe the attackers.

Diplomatic mission

Four years later, Mr. Noor is in Delhi on a diplomatic mission: calling for India to take a keener interest in the Afghan situation, that he fears will deteriorate if U.S. forces pull out completely, as they have announced they will, and Doha talks with the Taliban fail to make headway. Mr. Noor, whose son Khalid is the youngest member of the Afghan negotiating team in talks with the Taliban, is himself not sanguine about the success of the talks.

“The situation is complicated, and that is the reason I am here,” he told The Hindu in response to a question about worries that Afghanistan could return to a situation like 1996, when the Taliban took control of Kabul and allowed foreign groups like al-Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Toiba to grow. “I want to thank India for its proactive diplomacy in the past, and ask them to be more proactive. Unfortunately, as the U.S. leaves, the Taliban will be more aggressive, and Pakistan will gain more space,” he added, referring to Pakistan as the “mother of the Taliban”.

When asked what he meant by “proactive diplomacy”, Mr. Noor said that during his talks in Delhi with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla, he had spoken of the need for India to remain “in the game”, to have a robust presence in building regional consensus for peace, to help facilitate Intra-Afghan talks, and to support the Afghan government. He said he had also asked India to consider talking to the Taliban directly, in an effort to “broaden India’s interests” and to “dilute the influence of others”, pointing to the fact that regional countries, including China, Iran, Pakistan and Russia, had increased their leverage in Afghanistan through engagement with the Taliban.

Non-Pushtun leaders

Mr. Noor’s visit to Delhi follows invitations from the government to two other non-Pushtun Afghan leaders who were key commanders during the war against the Taliban: Rashid Dostum and the National Reconciliation Council chief Abdullah Abdullah, in a signal that India is re-engaging with players it has not been in contact with more recently, especially as each had differences with President Ashraf Ghani.

While Mr. Abdullah had visited India previously as the Chief Executive of Afghanistan, ties with New Delhi were strained after he contested President Ashraf Ghani’s re-election in January this year. However, Mr. Noor said the former ‘Resistance’ leaders are now united with the Ghani government in their defence of Afghanistan. A leader of the Jamiat party, and an influential power figure in Kabul today, Mr. Noor became a fighter at 18, battling the Soviet Army, and then the Taliban.

“If needed, we will all come together to fight again,” he says. “It won’t be the Northern Alliance... but the resistance will be there.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rqlqqf/article32937555.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-ATANOOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/once-us-leaves-pakistan-will-gain-more-space-in-afghanistan-says-ata-mohammad-noor/article32937556.ece
13,2020/10/24,"Pandemic will end soon, claims Trump","President accuses Joe Biden of overstating the health crisis to scare Americans into voting for him

President Donald Trump promised supporters in Florida on Friday that the coronavirus pandemic would end soon and accused Democratic rival Joe Biden of overstating the health crisis to scare Americans into voting for him.

The pandemic, which has killed more than 2,24,000 people in the United States and cost millions more their jobs, has become the dominant issue of the campaign, with Mr. Trump on the defensive over his administration’s handling of the crisis.

Comprehensive Bill

Mr. Biden earlier in the day said Mr. Trump had given up on containing the virus and promised if he wins the November 3 election, he will ask Congress to pass a comprehensive COVID-19 Bill that he would sign within the first 10 days of taking office.

“He’s quit on America. He just wants us to grow numb,” Mr. Biden said during a speech in his home city of Wilmington, Delaware. “I’m not going to shut down the economy. I’m not going to shut down the country. I’m going to shut down the virus.”

During two rallies in the battleground state of Florida, Mr. Trump mocked Mr. Biden for saying in Thursday night’s presidential debate that the U.S. was entering a “dark winter.”

He said the former Vice-President and his Democratic allies were trying to scare people by overstating the virus threat.

“We’re going to quickly end this pandemic,” Mr. Trump, who has played down the threat since it started, said in The Villages, a sprawling retirement community in central Florida.

Later, Mr. Trump told a big crowd in Pensacola that the election was a choice “between a boom and a lockdown.”

Warning by researchers

Researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation warned on Friday that the virus could kill more than half a million people in the U.S. by the end of February 2021. Roughly 1,30,000 lives could be saved if everybody wore masks, according to the study.

The campaign stops followed the second and final debate between the two contenders on Thursday night, when Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump sparred over how to handle the pandemic.

Mr. Trump’s campaign said on Friday it had raised $26 million around the debate. Mr. Biden’s campaign, which has trounced Mr. Trump in the money race in recent months, did not release a fundraising figure from the debate but sent out appeals saying they were outraised.

With 11 days left until the election, more than 53 million Americans have already voted, a record-setting pace, according to the University of Florida’s Elections Project. Michael McDonald, who administers the project, has said the election could set a modern turnout record, surpassing the 60% participation rate of recent presidential elections.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/36xx74/article32937495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-TOPSHOT-US-VOTE-TRUMP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pandemic-will-end-soon-claims-trump/article32937496.ece
14,2020/10/24,"Map controversy: It was distorted because of technical reasons, says Nepal","We have not diluted our claim to the Kalapani region, says Kathmandu

The map used to convey Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli’s Vijaya Dasami greetings was distorted because of technical reasons, the government of Nepal clarified on Saturday. Rajan Bhattarai, Foreign Affairs Advisor to Prime Minister Oli, said Nepal has not diluted its claim to the Kalapani region which has been at the centre of a territorial dispute.

“Scaling down of the image for online usage created this impression. It’s a technical issue. We have not changed our position at all on the territorial demand. The government of Nepal is strongly committed to the map that was passed by Parliament. It was the same map that was actually used in the message by the honourable Prime Minister,” said Mr. Bhattarai over phone from Kathmandu.

The response came after The Hindu reported that Mr. Oli’s message showed an old map which did not include the strategically located Kalapani-Lipulekh-Limpiyadhura region of the Pithoragardh district that Nepal has been claiming. Mr. Bhattarai blamed the online media of Nepal for creating ‘confusion’. “We are using the new map and the revised insignia for our festival greetings.”

The issue began on Friday when Mr. Oli sent out online greetings for Vijaya Dasami or Dashain which is the biggest festival of Nepal.

The triangular piece of land in the extreme northwest of Nepal is however shown as part of Nepalese sovereign territory in the new map unveiled on May 20 and was made part of the insignia of the Nepalese state by an amendment on June 13. Mr. Oli’s use of the national insignia carrying the old map drew strong reaction from the political class of Kathmandu with leaders expressing surprise.

“Mr. Oli at his individual level can use any map of Nepal that he wishes but as the Prime Minister he should have used the national map that was passed by Parliament and dedicated to the Nepalese people,” said Bishwaprakash Sharma, spokesperson of the Opposition Nepali Congress told The Hindu over phone. Mr. Sharma said Mr. Oli has undermined Parliament as the map was passed in both the Houses.

It also drew comments on social media with Nepalese users connecting the move with Thursday’s discussion that he held with Samant Kumar Goel, chief of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW). The visit drew attention as it came a fortnight before the scheduled visit of Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane.

Despite Saturday’s clarification from Mr. Bhattarai, the map had not been corrected on his social media pages.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/b3klis/article32937409.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OLISHARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/map-controversy-it-was-distorted-because-of-technical-reasons-says-nepal/article32937410.ece
15,2020/10/24,Monarchy | The Ramas of Thailand,"The royals, traditionally revered in the country, face pressure as protests mount

In Thailand, the King traditionally enjoyed a god-like status. The monarchs from the reigning Chakri dynasty that was founded in 1782 are called the Rama Kings, after the Hindu God Rama, the avatar of Lord Vishnu. The institution of the Thai monarchy, which is roughly 800 years old, has its roots in Hinduism and Buddhism. While the warrior Kings, under different dynasties, adopted Hindu Gods’ names as their official titles, the Theravada Buddhist concept of ‘Dhammaraja’ (kingship under dharma) has been the proclaimed goal of the monarchy. Even after it lost absolute powers in the 1932 Siamese revolution, the monarchy continued to enjoy an outsized influence in the government and society. Thailand’s strict lèse majesté rules shielded the King from public criticism, irrespective of the political changes. But the winds are now changing.

Thailand, which has seen 12 successful coups since 1932, is no stranger to mass uprisings. In the past, protests were largely focussed on the government or the powerful military. What makes the ongoing agitation, started earlier this year against the military-backed government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha, different is that the protesters are increasingly targeting the monarchy.

On October 14, protesters, mainly school and college students, tried to disrupt a royal motorcade in Bangkok that was carrying Queen Suthida and flashed the three-finger salute, a symbol of resistance and solidarity which they borrowed from The Hunger Games books and movies. It was an unprecedented show of dissent to the monarchy by protesters in a country where public criticism of the institution could land one in jail for up to 15 years. A day after, the government declared a state of emergency, banning public gatherings and censoring the media coverage of the protests.

Not backing off

But the protesters did not back off. They termed the emergency yet another move by the government to take away their freedoms. A week later, as it was clear that the students were determined to press ahead with their agitation, the government cancelled the emergency and called for calm. Protests in Thailand began after the pro-democracy Future Forward Party was banned by the country’s top court in February. But public resentment against the ruling elite was building up since the 2014 military coup that brought Mr. Prayuth to power. Since then, the military rewrote the Constitution, awarding itself and the monarchy more powers and privileges, and held an election last year, which made sure that Mr. Prayuth continued as the Prime Minister.

The new King, Maha Vajiralongkorn (the 10th monarch of the Chakri dynasty, also called Rama X), who ascended the throne in 2016 after the death of his father Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), blessed the coup masters, while the Generals spent millions to promote the monarchy. The King was earlier required to appoint a regent while travelling abroad. The new Constitution did away with this clause. The junta gave the monarch full control of the Crown Property Bureau, which manages the palace’s roughly $30 billion worth of assets. King Vajiralongkorn also brought two Army units under his direct control. He has steadily expanded the powers of the palace, while the military has used the monarch’s backing to gain legitimacy for its actions.

For the protesters, if the Prime Minister represented a repressive regime, the King, who is mostly in southern Germany, is a symbol of extravagance at a time when the country was wrecked by the pandemic.

In August, Anon Nampa, a 35-year-old human rights lawyer, called for reforms to the monarchy. The protesters have since submitted 10 demands to the government, asking for a separation of the King’s assets and the Crown Property Bureau, reducing the Palace’s share in the national budget, a ban on the King from expressing his political views and endorsing future coups.

The protesters say they were not against the institution of monarchy. What they want are reforms — a democratic Thailand with the King being a ceremonial head of the state — not abolition. For now, the government has ignored such demands, and warned against “insulting” the monarchy. But the fact that even a state of emergency did not stop the protests poses a serious challenge to both the government and the King.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jdrcfe/article32937145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-TOPSHOT-THAILAND-ROYALS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/monarchy-the-ramas-of-thailand/article32937146.ece
16,2020/10/24,Luis Arce | The socialist successor,"Bolivians vote for an aide of Evo Morales in defiance of the military-backed govt.

Last Sunday’s landslide victory for Luis Alberto (Lucho) Arce in the Bolivian presidential election is, arguably, a repudiation of the policies of the military-installed right-wing government that was formed after the disputed October 2019 election. Mr. Arce, a socialist and the long-time former Finance Minister, polled more than the combined vote share of his two nearest contenders, and thus eliminated a run-off. His Movement for Socialism (MAS) party obtained a comfortable parliamentary majority. The emphatic victory ends the political instability of nearly 11 months, after an unelected and little known evangelical senator Jeanine Anez assumed charge as the transitional leader last November. The elections were postponed twice, citing the COVID-19 emergency, causing fury among MAS supporters.

The recent verdict is simultaneously a resounding endorsement of Evonomics — the economic policies pursued under the former President of 14 years and the first indigenous occupant of the office, Evo Morales. They entailed the partial nationalisation of Bolivia’s extractive industries and revenue generation during the commodities boom, enabling the social redistribution programmes that lifted millions out of poverty.

The latest results have sparked media speculation that the man behind the throne in La Paz would be Mr. Morales, Mr. Arce’s mentor and former boss, who is to return from exile in Argentina. But there are enough indications already that while the 57-year old protégé intends to build on the Bolivian model to revive the sputtering economy, Mr. Morales would play no direct role in the government.

Mr. Arce’s plans include the substitution of the country’s import dependency with industrialisation on one hand, and securing international debt relief and levying a wealth tax on the other to raise revenues to continue MAS’s poverty alleviation initiatives.

Low-profile moderate

The President-elect, given his reputation as a low-profile moderate within the party, is perhaps best-placed to navigate the country’s recent tumultuous political divisions. Since the November 2019 ouster of Mr. Morales, the country has been rocked by violent confrontations between the security forces and MAS loyalists. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has dubbed the killings of protesters as a massacre and called for an international investigation.

Born in La Paz on September 28, 1963, Mr. Arce grew up in a middle class family. He graduated from the University of Warwick, England, in 1997 with a masters in economics. Mr. Arce spent a large part of his career as a public official at the Central Bank of Bolivia.

In 2006, Mr. Morales, who came to power riding the pink wave that was sweeping through South America, appointed Mr. Arce as the Minister of Economics and Public Finance. Ever since, he remained a close aide of Mr. Morales. He oversaw the rapid expansion of the economy as well as the public spending programmes, which helped MAS build a strong connect with the country's poor.

Syncretic traditions

Interim President Anez had rolled back many of Mr. Morales’s policies. Her display of the Bible at public appearances, in a demonstration of her Catholic identity, downplayed Bolivia’s syncretic traditions of respect for diverse racial symbols at a time when social relations have been strained.

Underscoring the overall direction of his government and the urgent need for national reconciliation, the President-elect promised in a speech following his victory to establish a unity government, to effect change without hate and to learn from MAS’s past mistakes.

The latter remark was possibly an oblique reference, among others, to the controversial and blatantly undemocratic judicial reversal of the 2016 referendum verdict, wherein the people opposed changes to the Constitution that would have authorised Mr. Morales to run for a fourth presidential term.

The fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has placed the country as the third highest in terms of per capita rate of deaths, is the other big challenge facing the next government. Mr. Arce has earned a mandate for the policies he crafted in the past. Now the challenge is to live up to the expectations of the voters in the midst of the unprecedented public health emergency.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/u5ostz/article32937127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LUIS-ARCE-FINAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/luis-arce-the-socialist-successor/article32937129.ece
17,2020/10/24,Pakistan Democratic Movement | Taking on the Generals and their Prime Minister,"Rival opposition parties have come together on a single platform, challenging the government of Imran Khan and the powerful military

Pakistan has been there before. Political parties coming together in alliance to take on a military dictator or an authoritarian civilian government. This time, it is in the form and shape of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), which has both the Pakistan Muslim League (N) and the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) as leading lights.

The old warhorse Maulana Fazlur Rehman, head of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F), is the president of the PDM.

In 73 years of existence, Pakistan has been under military rule on four occasions. Time and again, the Army has demonstrated that it wants civilian Prime Ministers to be brought to heel. Usually, the coup has been the preferred khaki style but with Imran Khan as Prime Minister it’s been held out as a “hybrid” model of governance.

Two recent rallies in Gujranwala, Punjab, and in Karachi, Sindh, have galvanised the Opposition and brought what were once two opposing poles of Pakistani politics — the PML (N) and the PPP — out in the open to attack both Prime Minister Imran Khan and his Army props.

As many as 11 political parties, many of them regional entities, came together to form the PDM on September 20 in Islamabad.

Demanding the Prime Minister’s resignation, they decided to put in place an alliance structure, which will “lead and guide nationwide protests against the anti-public and anti-nation government in a disciplined and integrated manner”.

Arguing that Mr. Khan’s government had been accorded “fake stability” by the establishment, the PDM expressed “extreme concern” at the increasing interference of the establishment in Pakistablistering attack

Blistering attack

Such statements are pretty standard in Pakistani politics. But former Prime Minister and PML(N) leader Nawaz Sharif departed from the standard when he launched a blistering attack on the serving Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, whom he had appointed to the job back in November 2016, superseding two generals senior to Gen. Bajwa.

Mr. Sharif also took on the serving Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) chief Faiz Hameed, a close associate of General Bajwa, in his video address from London to the first PDM rally in Gujranwala on October 17.

“You are responsible for the exit of my smooth-running government,” Mr. Sharif thundered at Gen. Bajwa. “You got judges to write the judgments you wanted,” Mr. Sharif, who is convicted for corruption, said. The three-time Prime Minister also laid the blame for rising prices and unemployment at Gen. Bajwa’s door. About the serving ISI chief, Mr. Sharif claimed, “all this had been done” at Gen. Hameed’s instance.

His comments are nothing short of blasphemous in Pakistani politics. You can talk of the “establishment”, a euphemism for the Army, but you can’t name names. Mr. Sharif has broken that tradition and his public comments blaming Gen. Bajwa have created ripples in the country’s politics.

Mr. Sharif is also likely to have created problems for his alliance partner, the PPP, and other more moderate and risk-averse politicians like his own brother and senior PML (N) politician Shehbaz Sharif. But then he’s sitting in London and is unlikely to return.

The leader on the ground for him is his daughter Maryam Nawaz, someone to watch out for in Pakistan.

On the defensive

“The Army has been put on the defensive by the PDM rallies. Their spokespersons have to come out to defend them,” a Karachi-based analyst, who preferred anonymity, told The Hindu. “It’s good that Mr. Sharif is naming names. These things should be out in the open. Everyone knows who is backing Imran Khan’s government.”

If Mr. Sharif ruffled feathers with his comments on Gen. Bajwa, the arrest of Captain Safdar, Maryam Nawaz’s husband, from their hotel room, in the early hours of October 19 after a successful PDM rally in Karachi, was nothing short of inexplicable. “Police broke my room door at the hotel I was staying at in Karachi and arrested Capt. Safdar,” Ms. Maryam tweeted after the incident.

There is CCTV footage of Capt. Safdar being taken away by armed men as well as these personnel standing outside Mariyam Nawaz’s room.

This story is unlikely to die down in a hurry and will be used by the PDM to hit out at both Mr. Khan and the Army leadership.

But what happened before the arrest was equally bizarre.

Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar, Inspector-General of Police in Sindh, was reportedly abducted by personnel of the Pakistani Rangers, a central force, on Sunday-Monday night, and forced to sign on the dotted line so that Capt. Safdar could be arrested.

Later, IGP Mahar and 14 other senior Sindh police offers decided to take earned leave, only to withdraw their applications after top PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari called up Army chief Gen. Bajwa, who then ordered an “inquiry” into the incident.

“The unfortunate incident that occurred on the night of 18/19 October caused great heartache and resentment within all ranks of Sindh Police... IG Sindh has decided to defer his own leave and ordered his officers to set aside their leave applications for 10 days in the larger national interest, pending the conclusion of the inquiry [ordered by Gen. Bajwa],” the Sindh police said on Twitter.

All this stuff is unprecedented. If the Pakistan Rangers and Army personnel can kidnap an IGP of a province, then it raises questions on the country’s political system. The fact that Mr. Bhutto spoke to the Army chief and not the serving Prime Minister shows his lack of confidence in the leadership of Mr. Khan.

The Prime Minister has himself played his dharna politics while in Opposition so he should be cognizant that events such as this bizarre kidnapping and arrest can sometimes have a long-lasting impact on people’s perceptions.

Great partnership

Mr. Khan and General Bajwa have had a great partnership going. “For the first time, the Prime Minister and the Army chief are on the same page. There are no differences of opinion even on foreign policy issues like India and Afghanistan. Make no mistake, Mr. Khan will complete his term in office,” an Islamabad-based analyst said. Pakistan is due for elections only in 2023.

Whether it is Mr. Nawaz Sharif or the PPP leadership, the Army as an institution has never been totally convinced that the “civilians” are sufficiently attuned to furthering khaki interests. So, Mr. Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) were built up to “partner” so that the Army doesn’t have to be seen taking power directly yet again.

Economic strains can upset this Khan-Bajwa partnership. So can ham-handed actions of the kind on display in Karachi. Mr. Khan can probably ride out this storm with Gen Bajwa’s backing. Bluster, however, can’t be a substitute for governance.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v157dz/article32937124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25ImranProtest,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-democratic-movement-taking-on-the-generals-and-their-prime-minister/article32937125.ece
18,2020/10/24,At least 13 killed in suicide bombing at Kabul education centre,"The attack came in an area of west Kabul that is home to many from the Shia community.

A suicide bombing on Saturday at an education centre in Afghanistan's capital Kabul killed at least 13 people and injured dozens, officials said.

A Taliban spokesman on Twitter denied responsibility for the attack, which came at a sensitive time as teams for the insurgents and government meet in Qatar to seek a peace deal even as violence rises and the United States withdraws troops.

A Ministry of Interior spokesman, Tariq Arian, cited security guards as identifying a bomber who detonated explosives in the street outside the Kawsar-e Danish educational centre.

Health Ministry spokesman Saeed Jami said 13 bodies had been recovered and 30 injured people transported by ambulance to hospitals. Casualties could rise, he added.

The attack came in an area of west Kabul that is home to many from the Shia community, a minority in Afghanistan targeted by groups such as Islamic State in the past.

19,2020/10/24,Fresh clashes erupt in Nagorno-Karabakh after Washington talks,"Azerbaijan's Defence Ministry reported fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, a part of Azerbaijan populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.

New clashes broke out between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces over Nagorno-Karabakh a day after talks in Washington to try to end the deadliest fighting in the mountain enclave in more than a quarter of a century.

Azerbaijan's Defence Ministry reported fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, a part of Azerbaijan populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.

Local officials accused Azerbaijan's forces of shelling buildings in Stepanakert, the largest city in the region, which Baku denied.

The Hindu Explains | What’s behind the Armenia-Azerbaijan clashes?

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met separately with the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia on Friday in a new attempt to end nearly a month of bloodshed that Russian President Vladimir Putin said may have killed 5,000 people.

The collapse of two Russia-brokered ceasefires had already dimmed the prospect of a quick end to fighting that broke out on Sept. 27 over Nagorno-Karabakh.

Azeri forces say they have made territorial gains, including full control over the border with Iran, which Armenia denies. Nagorno-Karabakh's ethnic Armenian administration says its forces have repulsed attacks.

Ready for talks, says Azerbaijan

President Ilham Aliyev told French newspaper Le Figaro that Azerbaijan was ready to sit down for negotiations but blamed Armenia's actions for the continued hostilities.

“We are ready to stop even today,” Aliyev was quoted as saying. “But, unfortunately, Armenia grossly violated the ceasefire ...If they don't stop, we will go to the end with the aim of liberating all the occupied territories.”

U.S. President Donald Trump said “good progress” was being made on the issue but did not elaborate and declined to say if he had spoken with the leaders of either country.

Asked how his talks went, Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan told reporters “very good” as he exited the U.S. State Department, and added that work on a ceasefire would continue.

World powers want to prevent a wider war that draws in Turkey, which has voiced strong support for Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.

Shortly before the Washington talks, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul that he hoped Moscow and Ankara could work together on resolving the conflict.

Differences over the conflict have further strained relations between Ankara and its NATO allies, with Pompeo accusing Turkey of fuelling the conflict by arming the Azeri side. Ankara denies it has inflamed the conflict.

Mr. Pompeo had said ahead of Friday's talks that he hoped the ”right path forward” could be found.

But Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said he saw no diplomatic resolution of the conflict at this stage, and Aliyev has described the prospects of a peace settlement as “very remote”.

21,2020/10/24,COVID-19: Two Melbourne schools shut,"About 800 residents in Melbourne’s northern suburbs have been isolating because of the school outbreak

All staff and students from two schools in northeast Melbourne have been told to immediately get tested for COVID-19 after the emergence of seven new cases on Saturday. There were no deaths.

Both schools will be closed for the next two weeks. Already about 800 residents in Melbourne’s northern suburbs have been isolating because of the school outbreak. Warnings have been circulated to workers, including taxi drivers, who might have visited the area.

The state’s death toll remained at 817 on Saturday and the national figure at 905, with only one death in the past week.

The updated figures Saturday followed the city’s most significant anti-lockdown protest on Friday. A Freedom Day rally began mid-afternoon and continued for several hours, erupting at times in violent scuffles between police and demonstrators. Protesters, many of whom did not wear masks, called for an end to lockdown restrictions.

Police arrested 16 people and handed out dozens of fines for breaches of health directives, including those that make mask-wearing compulsory and limit trips to 25 km from home.

Three police officers were injured during the protests and one was taken to a hospital.

22,2020/10/24,"I know the pride you feel about Kamala Harris’ nomination, Joe Biden tells Indian Americans in op-ed article","Major parties have been wooing Indian Americans, whose numbers in some battleground States have exceeded the victory margin there in 2016

With just days to go for the U.S. election, both major parties have been wooing Indian Americans, whose numbers in some battleground States have exceeded the victory margin there in 2016. Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s outreach to the community included a recent op-ed that talked about his main campaign issues – the botched pandemic response and rebuilding the economy – but also included diaspora specific messages, including his running mate Kamala Harris’s Indian origins.

“Four years ago in November, one of the last events I hosted at the Vice President’s residence was a Diwali reception. Here I was, an Irish Catholic Vice President opening my home for a holiday traditionally observed by Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains, and that night joined by Muslims, Christians, and Indian Americans of various backgrounds representing the diversity of the diaspora,” he wrote.

On Ms. Harris, he wrote: “Kamala is smart, tested, and prepared. But another thing that makes Kamala so inspiring is her mother, Shyamala Gopalan. We feel Kamala’s pride when she talks about her. She was from Chennai…”

“I know the pride you feel about her nomination because her story is your story, too. It’s an American story. And it’s why I’m asking Kamala to be what Barack Obama asked of me to be: the last person in the room and, together, to represent the belief in possibilities,” Mr. Biden said.

The recent Indian American Attitudes Survey found that the Harris running-mate pick had had a significant turnout effect – 49% of Indian Americans surveyed said the choice of Ms. Harris made them more enthusiastic about Mr. Biden’s candidacy, while 15% said it made them less enthusiastic about him.

Also read: Joe Biden not good for India as he could be soft on China, says Donald Trump Jr

In the op-ed, Mr. Biden talked about the Trump administration trying to have the Affordable Care Act overturned in the U.S. Supreme Court during the pandemic and connects Mr. Trump with Wall Street (a recurring theme in the Biden campaign), saying a handful of billionaires have done well in the pandemic.

Mr. Biden also addressed Mr. Trump’s race-related rhetoric and recent policies tightening legal immigration (such as the temporary suspension of the H1B programme and new immigrant visas) in the op-ed.

“We also believe America is a land of opportunity. But it’s likely you and your family have been caught in the middle of President Trump’s crackdown of legal immigration and pathways to permanent residency and citizenship and his decisions on the H-1B visa program. And his dangerous rhetoric about immigrants has empowered white supremacists and even fueled hate crimes against Indian Americans,” he said.

23,2020/10/24,Final Trump-Biden presidential debate draws 63 million viewers,"On Thursday, the candidates debated mostly over health care

The final presidential debate between President Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden drew 10 million fewer viewers than their first meeting.

An estimated 63 million viewers tuned into the debate featuring Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden on Thursday night, the Nielsen company said Friday. The debate was hosted at Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee.

The numbers were tallied between 15 networks that aired the debate. Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden’s first matchup last month was seen by 73.1 million people. The second debate was cancelled after Trump’s coronavirus infection and replaced by duelling town halls on ABC and NBC — the viewership for both the presidential candidates together was 27.6 million.

The Biden town hall reached 14.1 million people, while Trump had 13.5 million. On Thursday, the candidates debated mostly over health care, energy policy and how Trump handled the coronavirus pandemic.

24,2020/10/24,Crisis in hospitals as U.S. nears high for COVID-19 cases,"States from Connecticut to the Rocky Mountain West reel under the virus surge

The United States is approaching a record for the number of new daily coronavirus cases in the latest ominous sign about the disease’s grip on the nation, as states from Connecticut to the Rocky Mountain West reel under the surge.

Also read: COVID-19 vaccine delivery to begin in January, says U.S. official

The impact is being felt in every section of the country — a lockdown starting Friday at the Oglala Sioux Tribe’s reservation in South Dakota, a plea by a Florida health official for a halt to children’s birthday parties, dire warnings from Utah’s governor, and an increasingly desperate situation at a hospital in northern Idaho, which is running out of space for patients and considering airlifts to Seattle or Portland, Oregon.

""We’ve essentially shut down an entire floor of our hospital. We’ve had to double rooms. We’ve bought more hospital beds,” said Dr. Robert Scoggins, a pulmonologist at the Kootenai Health hospital in Coeur d’Alene. “Our hospital is not built for a pandemic.”

In the southern Idaho city of Twin Falls, St. Luke’s Magic Valley Medical Center said it would no longer accept children because it is overwhelmed with coronavirus patients. Except for newborns, all under age 18 will be sent 206 km away in Boise.

Among those in northern Idaho joining Scoggins at a meeting of Idaho’s Panhandle Health District was board member Walk Kirby.

""People are dying, they’re going to keep dying and catching this stuff,” Kirby said. “How many people won’t wear a mask? The same people that won’t get vaccinated for it.”

Utah’s Gov. Gary Herbert proclaimed Friday to be “a record day for Utah - but not a good one” as COVID-19 cases reached an all-time high for the state.

""Up until now, our hospitals have been able to provide good care to all COVID and non-COVID patients who need it,” he said. “But today we stand on the brink. If Utahans do not take serious steps to limit group gatherings and wear masks, our healthcare providers will not have the ability to provide quality care for everyone who needs it.”

Watch | Oxford's COVID-19 vaccine shows positive results

By public health order, masks are required in 21 counties, said Herbert, urging Utah residents to wear one whenever they are around someone outside their immediate household.

The seven-day rolling average for new daily COVID-19 cases in the U.S. surpassed 61,140 Thursday, compared with 44,647 two weeks ago. The record was reached July 22 when the rolling average was 67,293 in the midst of a summer outbreak driven largely by surges of the virus in Florida, Texas, Arizona and California.

The U.S. recorded 71,671 new cases Thursday, with several states setting records across the Midwest and West.

The U.S. surge mirrors a similarly widespread spike in Europe, where Rome, Paris and other major cities are reining in nightlife as part of the increasingly drastic measures undertaken to slow the spread of the pandemic. French authorities said the country had recorded over 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic, becoming the second country in Western Europe after Spain to reach that number.

The head of the World Health Organization warned that countries in the Northern Hemisphere are at a “critical juncture” as cases and deaths continue to rise.

""The next few months are going to be very tough and some countries are on a dangerous track,” said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a press briefing on Friday.

Some of the latest developments in the United States-

South Dakota

In South Dakota, the Oglala Sioux Tribe ordered a one-week lockdown of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in response to a surging number of COVID-19 cases in the state. Through the morning of Oct. 30, all non-essential travel is banned and non-essential businesses must close.

The tribe posted on its Twitter page that there were 391 active COVID-19 cases as of Thursday on the reservation, which has about 20,000 residents.

The lockdown comes as South Dakota surpassed 9,000 active coronavirus cases on Thursday and reported an all-time high of 973 new cases in one day.

Florida

The top health official in one of Florida’s most populous counties discouraged parents from hosting birthday parties for their children, no matter the size.

Dr. Raul Pino, a state health officer in Orange County, said half of the 30 attendees at a recent Sweet 16 party in the Orlando area came down with the virus. Last month, an Orange County high school closed for two weeks after students who had attended a birthday party tested positive.

""Those parties will not only affect those people participating in that activity, but also everyone else they come into contact with when they leave,” said Pino. “We will continue to see consequences if we don’t act super-responsibly.”

Texas

In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott is sending more medical reinforcements to the El Paso area in response to a surge of coronavirus infections. The Texas Department of State Health Services and the Texas Division of Emergency Management will provide more medical personnel and equipment this week.

El Paso County reported 3,750 new coronavirus infections this week, including 1,161 on Thursday. That number accounts for 17.5% of the 21,321 cases reported this week by the state’s 254 counties.

Idaho

Even as the health-care situation worsened in northern Idaho, a regional health board voted to repeal a local mask mandate. It acted moments after hearing how the Kootenai Health hospital in Coeur d’Alene had reached 99% capacity.

Kootenai is the third-most populous county in conservative Idaho.

The state is experiencing its largest coronavirus spike since the pandemic began, with new cases increasing statewide by 46.5% percent over the past two weeks. Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, has declined to take steps such as requiring masks statewide to slow the virus’ spread.

Dr. Joshua Kern, vice president of St. Luke’s in the Magic Valley region that includes Twin Falls and Jerome, said Thursday during a virtual press conference that he and other medical professionals are scared.

""The purpose of any intervention around coronavirus has been to prevent the hospitals from being overwhelmed, and here I am today saying the hospital is being overwhelmed,” he said.

A day later on Friday, his hospital announced the move to send younger patients to Boise.

New jersey and Connecticut

For a while, as new COVID-19 cases surged in the Midwest and elsewhere, the level of new cases remained low in the Northeast, which had been hit hard earlier in the pandemic. Several states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, imposed 14-day quarantine requirements for travelers arriving from dozens of states with higher rates of positive tests.

This week, however, rates in New Jersey and Connecticut rose to the point where they qualify for their own quarantine restrictions.

After some confusion, the Democratic governors of New Jersey, Connecticut and New York, where rates remain lower, decided to keep their travel rules in place, but not add each other to their quarantine lists.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/b3r6x1/article32934984.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDUSAHOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/crisis-in-hospitals-as-us-nears-high-for-covid-19-cases/article32934985.ece
25,2020/10/24,"Coronavirus | AstraZeneca, J&J vaccine trials back on track in U.S.","‘The FDA reviewed all safety data from trials globally and concluded it was safe to resume the trial’

Two major clinical trials for experimental COVID-19 vaccines got back on track in the United States Friday -- providing a glimmer of hope as the number of cases skyrocket across the country.

COVID-19 has now killed more than 223,000 Americans, and the health crisis is a top issue in the presidential election pitting incumbent Donald Trump against Joe Biden.

AstraZeneca announced that the trial of its vaccine candidate, developed with Britain's University of Oxford, has resumed in the U.S., the only country where it remained suspended following a participant's illness six weeks ago.

“The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today authorized the restart in the U.S., following the resumption of trials in other countries in recent weeks,” the drugmaker said.

The trial was suspended worldwide on September 6, but resumed shortly thereafter in Britain, and in the following weeks in South Africa, Brazil and Japan, with authorities determining the illness was not apparently linked to the vaccine.

“The FDA reviewed all safety data from trials globally and concluded it was safe to resume the trial,” AstraZeneca said.

The company added it was hoping to have results later this year, “depending on the rate of infection within the communities where the clinical trials are being conducted.”

The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine project is one of the most promising and advanced in the world to combat the global pandemic, which has now claimed the lives of 1.1 million people.

It is one of 10 vaccine candidates being tested on tens of thousands of people in so-called phase 3 trials.

In the United States, the two top candidates vying to get a green light from the FDA are those made by Pfizer and Moderna. Both expect to request approval next month.

Many countries are counting on using the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine to inoculate their populations.

The drugmaker pre-sold hundreds of millions of doses on several continents, and signed partnership deals with other producers to ensure the doses could be made locally.

'No evidence' vaccine to blame

Shortly after AstraZeneca's announcement, Johnson & Johnson said it was preparing to resume recruitment for its parallel trial, which was suspended last week after a volunteer fell ill.

“After a thorough evaluation of a serious medical event experienced by one study participant, no clear cause has been identified,” the group said in a statement.

“The company has found no evidence that the vaccine candidate caused the event.”

Just before Friday's announcements, a top US official involved with Operation Warp Speed, the government's vaccine initiative, said he expected the J&J trial to resume quickly.

Paul Mango, from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, also said he expected the country to have enough doses on hand to vaccinate the “most vulnerable” Americans before year's end.

“By the end of January, we believe we'll be able to vaccinate all seniors,”Mr. Mango said, adding that by March or April, “we believe we'll be able to vaccinate any American who desires a vaccination.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/5kqyrj/article32818235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ASTRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-astrazeneca-jj-vaccine-trials-back-on-track-in-us/article32934657.ece
26,2020/10/24,Brazil authorizes import of potential vaccines from China,"The decision comes just days after President Jair Bolsonaro insisted he wouldn’t allow doses to be shipped from the Asian nation.

Brazil’s health regulator has authorized the import from China of a potential vaccine against the coronavirus, just days after President Jair Bolsonaro insisted he wouldn’t allow doses to be shipped from the Asian nation.

The health regulator, Anvisa, said in a statement Friday that Sao Paulo state’s Butantan Institute can import 6 million doses of the CoronaVac shot that Chinese biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac is developing.

The potential vaccine cannot be administered to Brazilians as it isn’t yet approved locally, the statement said.

Earlier this week, Mr. Bolsonaro sparked confusion when he publicly rejected the CoronaVac shot, saying Brazilians would not be used as guinea pigs. The declaration followed news that his health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, had agreed to purchase CoronaVac doses produced locally by the Butantan Institute.

On Wednesday, the executive secretary of Brazil’s Health Ministry said in a televised statement that there had been a misunderstanding.

“There is no intention to buy vaccines from China,” said Antonio Elcio Franco, who added there will be only “a Brazilian vaccine” made at the Butantan Institute. Brazil’s presidential palace didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about Anvisa’s authorization of imported vials.

Its authorization comes after the Butantan Institute’s director, Dimas Covas, told newspaper Folha de S.Paulo that Anvisa was withholding permission to import inputs from Sinovac in order to produce the vaccine in Brazil.

Anvisa said in a separate statement earlier Friday that it had analyzed the request and found some discrepancies.

Mr. Bolsonaro has often expressed mistrust of China, particularly on the campaign trail in 2018, although he has softened his rhetoric somewhat in office.

“From China, we will not buy. I don’t believe it transmits enough safety to the population, because of its origin. That’s our thinking,” he said in an interview with radio station Jovem Pan on Thursday night. “With certainty, other vaccines that are being studied could be scientifically proven.”

27,2020/10/24,Nepal map row | PM Oli hints at softer stand with Dasara greetings,"The Nepal Prime Minister sends Dasara greetings using old map without Indian territory.

After months of simmering dispute with India over the Kalapani issue, Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli indicated a softer line on Friday when he used an old map of Nepal to greet everyone on the festival of Vijaya Dashami. The old map does not show the region of Kalapani-Lipulekh-Limpiyadhura, which is part of India’s Pithoragarh district.

The triangular piece of land is, however, shown as part of Nepalese sovereign territory in the new map, which was unveiled on May 20, and made part of the insignia of the Nepalese state by an amendment on June 13.

Prime Minister Oli’s use of the national insignia of Nepal carrying the old map has drawn strong reactions from the political class of Kathmandu, with leaders expressing surprise about the use of the old map during Dasara, which is the biggest festival in the Himalayan country.

“Prime Minister Oli at his individual level can use any map of Nepal that he wishes but as the Prime Minister of Nepal, he should have used the national map of Nepal that was passed by Parliament and dedicated to the Nepalese people,” said Bishwaprakash Sharma, spokesperson of the Opposition Nepali Congress, speaking to The Hindu over phone.

Mr. Sharma said Mr. Oli has undermined Parliament by not using the new map.

Sharp reactions

Use of the old map also drew sharp reactions on social media, with Nepalese users connecting the move with Thursday’s discussion between Mr. Oli and Samant Kumar Goel, chief of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW), the external intelligence wing of India.

Nepalese publication Myrepublica reported that Mr. Goel led a nine-member delegation. The visit drew attention as it came a fortnight before the scheduled visit to Nepal of General Manoj Mukund Naravane, chief of the Indian Army.

Since the unveiling of the new map and the amendment in Parliament that gave it a legal status, Nepal has not gone back on its demands on the Kalapani-Lipulekh-Limpiyadhura. Mr. Oli has spoken on the phone with Prime Minister Modi but no meeting of the border mechanism has so far been held to discuss the issue.

Mr. Oli has, meanwhile, firmed up his hold over the government of Nepal and resisted challenges from rivals in the Standing Committee of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP).",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/t6d9me/article32933331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THRDOLI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nepal-map-row-pm-oli-hints-at-softer-stand-with-dasara-greetings/article32933332.ece

Earlier this month, Ultimate Fighting Championship superstar Holly Holm was in top form at the UFC Fight Night held at Yas Island in Abu Dhabi, as the professional boxer/ kickboxer-turned-MMA fighter beat Irene Aldana, and set up yet another run for the bantamweight title.

In her storied career, the Hall of Fame champion boxer has seen it all, as a multiple-time world champion in boxing, defending her titles 18 times in three weight classes, and holding the distinction of being the first (and only) fighter to hold a world boxing title as well as a UFC title.

Widely considered among the best female boxers of all time, Holly also gained worldwide fame in 2015 when she won the bantamweight title, giving popular wrestler/ MMA fighter Ronda Rousey her first loss in the sport, in what was hailed as one of the biggest upsets in combat sports history.

Today in the ‘new normal,’ Holly belongs to the select group of pro-athletes in combat sport who have to engage with their peers in close quarters during matches, as compared to the likes of football or cricket where social distancing can be naturally followed.

“We have had a whole different experience than anything else, going across the world, quarantining and all that. I have a great team with me, and my coaches are great, helping me get some workouts in and I’m very prepared,” Holly tells us on a Zoom call from Abu Dhabi, where she was present for UFC Fight Night.

“Back where I live, even when COVID first started, I was able to be outside running, working out and so on. Then the gyms opened up and I had great training partners who helped me stay in shape during the pandemic. So I’m lucky it hasn’t affected me too badly,” says the 38-year old.

She adds, “My family has been really supportive and asked me to keep fighting. We have had like four or five tests, so there's that ease in our minds that we aren’t being exposed to a bunch of people by travelling.”

Being one of the most experienced UFC fighters on the circuit, does she come under pressure to perform each time she steps into the ring? How are events different now without any fans cheering or jeering?

“Yeah, I definitely feel the pressure — but in a good way. I feel like if things weren’t expected of me, it means I haven’t accomplished anything before. I want to show people why I’m still here and fighting. The atmosphere now... it’s different, but I’m okay with it. Fans are watching all over the world and I keep that in my mind; we are still fighting in front of millions. Once you’re in there with your opponent, you want to win, that’s what I want to focus on,” Holly says.

Having adapted to the UFC’s techniques after a decorated boxing career, Holly explains that she had to evolve her style to fit in, after she made the switch: “Boxing is very different from MMA. You’re not worrying about the kicking range, the clench, the wrestling and grappling. Some habits from boxing had to stop which don’t work in MMA, and I had to evolve as a mixed martial artist.”

Does she have advice for aspiring female boxers in countries like India? “Keep following your dreams and be patient. A lot of times, people get into the sport, but forget it takes time to progress from the amateur to professional stage. You aren’t getting a title fight in your first bout. Take it one step at a time and don’t get complacent. Challenge and believe in yourself. It takes time to learn.”

Holly concludes with a word on some of the most treasured memories in her career: “Anytime I’ve been a huge underdog. Everyone remembers the Ronda fight, but there have been plenty of times where I came in and believed in myself, no matter what anybody said and the whole world is against you. Those are the victories that stick with you the most.”

29,2020/10/24,Somewhere in time,"South’s three-club bid showed a maximum with a high card in clubs in response to North’s min-max inquiry. Should North have asked? Probably not. It is usually a poor idea to bid two no trump, without a good fit for partner, unless your hand is worth a strong no trump or better. It might not be balanced but it should be that strong. Can you reasonably expect to make a game with less opposite a pre-empt? There might be a game out there somewhere in time but looking for it will lead to a lot of minus scores.

The four-heart contract would have chances on a different opening lead. Declarer might be allowed to ruff a spade in dummy and set up dummy’s diamonds before the defense set up their club trick. The club lead was awful for South. Not only was the defense getting after their club trick, they would probably knock out dummy’s ace of clubs, which would be needed as an entry to the diamonds if declarer could ever set them up.

South decided to try and use some deception to bring home his contract. He smoothly played low from both hands on the opening club lead! From East’s point of view, a diamond shift was not appealing, and a spade would assist South in getting a spade ruff in dummy. Trying to prevent a spade ruff in dummy, East reasonably shifted to a low heart. South quickly ran off six heart tricks and four club tricks to make his contract. Nice play!",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/2fl9jz/article32931191.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SM25BRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/society/somewhere-in-time/article32931192.ece
30,2020/10/24,From the Husain-Raza set to the Oscars: Bhanu Athaiya’s story,"Over 100 articles from Athaiya’s estate are coming up for auction, including her artworks and meticulously kept notes

The image of Bhanu Athaiya calmly walking up to receive the Oscar in a silver-studded blue chiffon sari with her white handbag clutched firmly under her arm is as iconic as the Ram Dhun the orchestra played to celebrate her win. Sir Richard Attenborough says it took him exactly 15 minutes to know that Athaiya was the right person to create the costumes for Gandhi.

Athaiya, who died aged 91 on October 15, wasn’t a woman given to talking about herself, or her incredible research into provincial and ancient costumes of India, or her relationships with a plethora of directors and stars over a 60-year career and 125-odd movies. Even her 2010 memoir, The Art of Costume Design, contained only 11 sketches and limited personal information. That’s why it’s both educational and disquieting to see that over 100 articles from Athaiya’s estate are coming up for auction between October 2020 and April 2021.

These will not include her Oscar or her Gandhi memorabilia that she returned to the Academy for safekeeping in 2012. The first lot currently on view includes her artworks and handwritten notes from the time she was the only woman in the Progressive Artists’ Group (PAG), as well as information about her family and early life. These alone make her story worthy of a museum collection.

Still from ‘Gandhi’

Father’s legacy

Athaiya’s handwritten notes mention that her father, Ganpatrao ‘Annasaheb’ Rajopadhye, was a rich, self-taught artist from Kolhapur. He encouraged his wife and six daughters to study and even hired an art tutor for Athaiya when she was eight. He served as an associate director on the Telugu film Harischandra (1935) and ventured into independent direction and production a few years later.

He died in September 1940 while his film Mohini (1940, Marathi) was still under production, but it introduced the 10-year-old Athaiya to films; she played the role of the king’s son in it.

Athaiya started working as a part-time illustrator for a woman’s weekly called Fashion and Beauty. Her greatest moment of pride was painting Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba for the Independence Day issue of August 15, 1947. By 1948, she was winning prizes and her teacher recommended her for a scholarship at the J.J. School of Art in Mumbai — the hub of the European style of painting in India. Simultaneously, she landed a part-time job as fashion illustrator for the newly launched Eve’s Weekly.

She also designed for the magazine’s boutique, where film stars like Nargis and Kamini Kaushal shopped. Nargis introduced her to Raj Kapoor, who asked her to design Nadira’s clothes in Shri 420 (1955), which created a fashion sensation.

At J.J. School, V.S. Gaitonde was her teacher and her influence can be seen in his work of this time. He also did a painting of her called Portrait of Bhanu (1952). In her graduating year, she won both a gold medal and a fellowship to study mural painting. Invited to be a part of the PAG exhibition in 1953, she contributed two paintings, Prayers and Banana Sellers. This was an exciting time. “I, along with other upcoming artists such as M.F. Husain, Kishen Khanna, Raza, Ara, Souza, Gade, and others would meet and hear talks and accounts of the changing scene in art from other parts of the world,” writes Athaiya.

The pull of cinema

The PAG officially broke up in 1954, but Athaiya had chosen cinema by then. “The pull to be involved in cinema was far stronger and I finally gave in to it,” she writes. She worked in C.I.D. (1956), followed by Pyaasa (1957), Chaudhvin Ka Chand (1960) and Sahib Bibi Aur Ghulam (1962). In 1966, she did Teesri Manzil, Mera Saaya and Amrapali, and got a scholarship to study fashion design in France for six months.

“Paris opened up the world for me. I travelled to Spain to absorb the art of Goya and the colours and sights of the gondolas! Another weekend saw me taking in the art and cultural heritage of Rome!! As students, we were given a lot of opportunities to visit fashion houses and see the big names in the couture world at work,” she writes.

Gandhi (1982), of course, was the film that introduced her to the world. She designed all the Indian outfits for the huge cast, including the 3,00,000 extras in the funeral scene. “In my mind, I had told myself that I had done my best, that I had done justice to Gandhiji’s name and the freedom movement,” she writes.

She continued to be the most iconic costume designer in Indian cinema, designing ensembles that ranged from Simi Garewal’s breathtaking costumes in Siddhartha (1972) and Sridevi’s chiffon sarees in Chandni (1989) to Dimple Kapadia’s evocative Rajasthani ensembles in Lekin (1991) and the huge canvas of Indian and British costumes for Lagaan (2001). Her last film was the Marathi thriller Nagrik (2015).

That Athaiya was clearly aware of the importance of her work in formulating history through her art, design and historical research is evident from her meticulously kept notes. She stood toe to toe with the greatest artists, directors and illustrators and defined post-Independence India, both through her research on regional and ancient costumes and her ability to create contemporary glamour and fashion. “I had an understanding of culture,” she once said to a film critic.

It will be interesting to see if her designs and notes now find a home where they can be enjoyed by the public as her costumes were, or if they disappear into a vault somewhere.

31,2020/10/24,"The brightest star: Remembering Sheila Dhar, writer and singer","Sheila Dhar wrote of the gifts, struggles and comicality of those around her. But when it came to her own self and music, she was dismissive at best

One story that writer and singer Sheila Dhar told but did not write was about smoking on the sly. She was a young medical student then, before switching to English literature, and had just discovered the stolen joys of cigarettes. She smoked at college and thought rinsing out her mouth before her music classes insured her against being found out, but she was mistaken. One day after a somewhat dispiriting session, her music teacher dismissed her saying, “Bibi, ya toh gaana gayo, ya sutta maaro.” [“Young lady, you can either sing or light a fag.”]

Helpless guffaws shook her as she imitated his tone, relishing the coarseness of the teacher’s phrasing. She was speaking to a three-person audience: Rukun Advani and I had begun as her editors and become her friends; and Partho Datta was by then one of her closest musical friends. He is now a professor of Arts and Aesthetics at JNU, and scholarly rummagings through musical archives are part of a day’s work for him. Yesterday, he unearthed and sent across a treasure: a rare recording of a live performance, complete with crackling, occasional distortions, applause.

Mrs. Dhar’s recorded performances are few and scattered. Set beside her acute, brilliantly comic writing, the deeply meditative, interiorised quality of her singing is scarcely believable. This is not a performer telling stories with a merry twinkle and watching for the effect of her words on her audience; it is someone singing as a way of communing with the deepest reaches of her own being. It is as if the voice that sings and the one that speaks come from two different people.

Echoes of the singing voice can be found in the early part of her book Raga’n Josh, especially in the moving chapter on her mother, titled ‘Baua’, which reflects the introspective, sometimes deeply melancholic moods that overcame her. Her book is a memoir of a kind but it is not about herself. She writes of the gifts, struggles, comicality and joy of those who surround her: at times, family and friends, but centrally, musicians. When she does write about her own music, it is with a dismissive air, as if she were a comic misfit, a magpie among nightingales.

Someone asked me the other day why I had written in an article that working in the world of books was the best kind of work. One of the reasons is Mrs. Dhar, whom I would never have known but for my job. When I met her, I was a junior editor ordered to put her first book into paperback. She sailed into my room unexpectedly one afternoon to inspect me, infuriated at being thus relegated — few authors like a change of editors, especially if they are rolled downhill, from senior to junior. That first meeting went badly; she left with looks of withering exasperation. But she returned a fortnight later. She sank into a chair and dabbed at one of her eyes. It was half-closed, twitching, probably with an injury.

What’s so funny?

I felt a tide of unseemly giggles rise inside me. It must have been from panic at having to meet her again and the more I tried to clamp down on it, the worse it got.

“What’s so funny?” she said in an ominous tone. She was large, tall, imperious, a woman who would have inspired fear and awe if she were the head of a university or a government.

In the way people dig deeper graves in desperation, I managed to gasp, “You look like Lalita Pawar.” I was thinking of the actor from the 1960s who was known for her winking eye, a tic that was endlessly deployed in Hindi movies to comic effect. Having uttered the actor’s name, I knew it was all over for me. Mentally, I began emptying my recently acquired desk.

After a moment’s stunned silence, Mrs. Dhar started to twinkle and the open, guffawing laughter I came to know well began bubbling out of her. I think this merriment about herself is what made her dismissive of her own singing. Similarly, she refused to believe that her stories were worth telling. They were coaxed out of her with great patience by the publisher Esha Béteille, then a senior editor at Oxford University Press.

Mrs. Dhar’s next book, The Cooking of Music, was published by Permanent Black, and frequent editorial meetings were deemed essential by her and by us. We would get to work at mid-morning and by afternoon, distracting scents of mutton pasanda and fried lotus stem would waft across from the kitchen; after a huge lunch that left us comatose, there would be late afternoon tea with mung dal halwa from Ghantewala in Old Delhi. Before each such meeting, she would phone Partho Datta and plan the menu, especially the carnivorous part of it.

Culinary planning

“What should I cook for Anuradha, poor thing, a Bengali married to a vegetarian.”

“Why bother so much?” Partho would reply, pulling her leg.

She would say only half-joking, “Arre, kya kehte ho, beti ghar aa rahi hai.” [“Don’t say that. It’s my daughter coming home.”]

Mrs. Dhar died in 2001 of lung complications at 72. Right at the end, no visitors were allowed near her because she was vulnerable to infection. My last sight of her was from outside the door of her room, across many metres, masked. This seems an average daily cruelty now, but it was unnerving and heartbreaking then.

She would have liked this story, narrated by the Icelandic writer Andri Snær Magnason about his friend, the scientist Gudmunder Páll Ólafsson:

‘We were convinced that if he came back he would come as a bird, not as a majestic eagle or a great northern diver, but a misunderstood bird like a starling. Gudmunder Páll always took the side of misunderstood animals. Two days before his funeral, I opened the door to my office and heard a strange whistling of wings and a chirping. A little starling had somehow come in and was beating its wings frantically against the window. I could hardly believe my own eyes. I carefully caught the bird, held it gently in my grasp, and my eyes filled with tears. I opened the window, released the bird and watched him fly out into the late summer sun.’ (On Time and Water, 2020)

33,2020/10/24,"Sex, lies and Zoom calls","That ubiquitous post-Covid video conference is beginning to unveil a whole world of absurdities

One receives with no little dismay the news that an American gentleman by the name of Jeffrey Toobin has been suspended by TheNew Yorker magazine because he was seen masturbating on a Zoom work call. By all reports, Mr. Toobin is a serious man, a staffer of the prestigious New Yorker for 25 years and attached to CNN as a legal analyst, and one can’t help feeling that if this can happen to someone like him it could perhaps happen, if not to anyone, then certainly to a lot more people than one imagines. Not that one wants to imagine what one might call a Zoom-onanist in overly terrific detail.

The camera is watching

This incident follows an earlier one in which, during a Zoom city council meeting in Rio de Janeiro, one of the participants was overcome with the need to enjoy carnal exchange with his partner. The gent forgot (or failed) to turn off his camera and the other participants could see the frenetic activity in the far background of the frame. This being Brazil, a country more mature than others in these matters, the council chair continued the meeting while technicians were asked to cut off the feed from the erring member’s video and audio.

“I don’t believe a Zoom call is over until I hit LEAVE, quit my browser, shut down, close the laptop lid, stick my computer in a drawer and leave the room,” tweeted noted American art critic, Jerry Saltz. Given the various incidents of ‘backstage’ moments leaking into live conference mosaics it’s hard to label Mr. Saltz’s statement as paranoia; ‘due diligence’ might be a far more accurate tag for what he describes.

Among all the different compressions the pandemic is bringing to our lives — such as the melding of office and home space, the disintegration of the notion of working hours, the challenge to assumptions and needs for physical proximity previously taken for granted — the further mutation of the role the camera plays in our lives is a crucial one. The Toobin case, for example, lights up a lot of intersecting issues simultaneously.

Forbidden pleasures

Firstly, there are the much-discussed erotics of the computer screen that delivers digital slices from the rest of the world into your most private zone, your mind. The frisson of this might come from the feeling of controlling what the screen does and how it behaves, even as the Internet accidentally trips you into various rabbit holes of surprise and discovery.

On the flip side, there is the sizzle created by the reverse frame, that is, not what you can see via the computer but what the computer can see of you, specifically what the frame of the computer camera reveals of you and what it hides from the other(s), the above and below of it, the off-stage right and left of it.

Group video apps were already proliferating when they were given a turbo boost by Covid. Already we’ve had jokes about executives all dressed up for formal online meetings, suited but not booted, with all sorts of business going on below the deskline, so to speak, whether someone is in their track pants, pyjamas, briefs or whatever.

This schizo-dressing could begin from practical need or sheer laziness. But from the thrill provided by this, it’s but a short path to the age-old impulse of wanting to engage in sexual activity at times and in places where such activity is forbidden, to plunge into the whirl of pleasure proscribed by the context, often where the risk of being discovered and of ensuing repercussions is high.

Watching porn and using it to engage in atmanirbharta was one of the earliest uses of Internet video. Virtual sex by consenting parties is also now old hat. The proliferation of handheld devices has made porn and virtual sexual exchange even more ubiquitous. However, in these jaded times further sandpapered by Covid, all sorts of other stuff could bring an individual to libidinal satisfaction.

Mr. Toobin, for example, was participating in a kind of election ‘war game’ conducted by his magazine, where people were playing the roles of Trump, Biden, the Supreme Court, the military. Perhaps it’s a gross assumption to think he was fantasising about local activity while, presumably, thinking globally.

In these post-truth times, all sorts of things can excite people: quasi-news, fictional news, or data and information, false or true. The floating trigger of the screen can and probably does set off almost uncontrollable thrills in some people, whether it’s from Donald Trump’s (alleged) recovery from (alleged) Covid, or claims of daring fighter-bomber raids into a neighbouring country’s territory, or watching the sleaze fest of ‘Doorknob’ Goswami working to destroy the reputations of unsuspecting people.

34,2020/10/24,Gazing into the future,"As gated communities battle the pandemic, there are striking additions to the landscape. Will they become an integral part of it?

Spool back seven months. At CEEBROS Belvedere, jugaad had broken new ground. Temporary wash basins had come up, one at the entrance, and another in the garden. Connected to Sintex dustbins, these wash basins were a home-brewed idea. Right now, another jugaad is brewing at this gated community on Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) — 28 pedal-operated sanitiser stands are being made in-house. They would soon keep the “temporary” wash basins company.

Girish Narayanan, president, CEEBROS Belvedere Owners Association (CBOA) reveals, “We continue to have those wash basins at the gate and in a couple of other places. Besides, at the entrance to each block, a metal-based pedal-operated hand sanitiser stand has been parked. The next plan is to have one such stand at every floor.”

Hitting jugaad street

The community has seven blocks, each coming with four floors. So, providing sanitiser stands on 28 floors is the target.

“The Facilities Management Team is making pedal-operated sanitiser stands themselves instead of buying them from outside. They have already made a few makeshift pedal stands by using PVC pipes,” elaborates Girish, adding that already a couple of makeshift pedal stands made with PVC pipes have been pressed into service.

Girish wants to see hand-washing becoming a visible feature of community living, going well beyond the pandemic. Keeping germs of all stripes at bay, at all times, does not hurt anyone.

“By keeping a sanitiser stand on each floor, it becomes a more personalised solution for residents of that floor,” says Girish, adding that the pedal-stand project has invited sponsorships.

At the OSR park which comes paired with playthings, a stage and a basketball court that doubles as a badminton court, a permanent wash basin is set to be installed. Water and soap would be kept at the facility.

“The idea is that anyone entering the OSR area washes their hands, and washes again before leaving,” he says. “It is mandated and will be a permanent feature.”

A major reason for having a permanent sanitisation station at the OSR park is to protect children from other infections as well, he points out.

“Children can carry scabies, picking it from the mud. When they come home, they may immediately take a snack, forgetting to wash their hands. If we mandate washing of hands at the park itself, we ensure that kids are going to do it.”

Though Girish would like to say that the pedal-operated sanitiser stands would also be a permanent feature, he chooses to puts a guarded and realistic number to the initiative, for the time being.

“For another one year, at the least.”

Gateway to safety

A rack at the entrance of gated communities is a symbol of these times. Where deliveries are concerned, a great number of communities want to keep the exercise restricted to the gate for some more time to come. Many of them have gone in for a rack to make the collection process safer and easier.

“Three months ago, we kept a simple cost-effective rack at the gate, and it has changed the workflow and increased social distancing and minimised the time of contact between the community’s security staff and delivery professionals. Delivery persons straightaway keep these parcels on the racks. The security staff only have to hand it over when residents come to collect it,” says Suresh Dhayaalan, secretary, Victoria Towers Owners Welfare Association.

“There is a likelihood of this prop becoming a permanent feature,” adds Suresh, whose gated community is in Kazhipattur, OMR.

Even after communities feel safe about accepting deliveries on the doorsteps, will they offer the option of a safe facility at the gate where these can be deposited for collection?

If they do become a permanent feature, would these collection racks get more sophisticated, even evolving into a fool-proof locker system? Or would collection facilities be integrated into the construction, and made up of brick and mortar?

The pandemic has left us with more questions than answers, with many sure-footed answer stumbling along the way.

One observable feature is that, at this point in time, as communities try to streamline the deliveries collection process, many of them are prepared to spare some generous real estate and metal for it.

“We want to have the deliveries made at the gate for at least one more year. We have cleared a storeroom of electrical fittings — hardly ten metres from the gate — and are using it to keep the deliveries. We are going to place seven racks inside this room, one dedicated rack for each block. The delivery person would deliver the goods at the gate; collecting it, the security staff will place it in the appropriate rack, and inform the resident concerned. Residents have to collect their deliveries,” says Girish.

Wheel in a feature

One adjustment often necessitates other adjustments. At Appaswamy Cityside in Kandanchavady, a trolley used by the housekeeping staff for their work has been repurposed as a vehicle to transport deliveries to residents’ doorsteps.

“As the grabage collection bins come with wheels, we decided the trolley could be spared to meet a new exigency. The trolley is kept at the gate and when a heavy item or a collection of items have been delivered, and the resident concerned cannot lug it all the way back to their home, they could use the trolley,” says Rabiya Aftab, Association president at Appaswamy Cityside. “We may go in for one more trolley for this purpose. As we are just a 136-unit apartment, two trolleys would do.”

Though at present, the security staff wheel in deliveries for senior citizens at the community, Rabiya thinks after the pandemic, seniors may even want to exercise this option themselves, that is if the system of delivery of goods at the gate is allowed to continue.",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/jvuch9/article32935703.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25dc-pedal,https://www.thehindu.com/society/gazing-into-the-future/article32935704.ece
35,2020/10/24,Have you ever considered putting your community on a ‘declutter’ diet?,"During the lockdown, Elcot Avenue on Chennai’s IT Corridor started a novel Reuse-Recycle-Reduce forum online

Things bought on a whim and ignored after the initial enthusiasm is past. Things flaunted a gazillion times and therefore, cannot be flaunted anymore. Declutter Elcot Avenue (DEA) rockets such items back into the orbit of usefulness through a community-driven reusing exercise.

An initiative at Elcot Avenue in Sholinganallur, it transfers used and unused items rendered useless in one pair of hands to another pair that values it. It is for the owner to decide whether to offer an item for free or a price.

Benazir Tehrani started DEA on WhatsApp during lockdown when she realised her universe would not shrink into insignificance if it shed some non-essentials and essentials and those things that lay in-between. High up on the list was a telescope admittedly bought in a fit of impetuousness for her daughter, and put on star-gazing duty as frequently as the exoplanet Gliese 581g is visited. In plain terms, it remained unused.

With many of her neighbours in Elcot Avenue and Kumaraswamy Nagar, Sholinganallur, similarly identifying forgotten, dusty items, DEA has become a community initiative.

R. Ramaswamy, president of Clasic Farms Owners and Residents Association and Secretary-cum-Treasurer of Clasic Gardens Owners Association, Kumarasamy Nagar, puts it this way: “This community which has earned accolades and awards for its zero-waste initiatives, jumped at the idea of decongesting their homes and giving away gently used items.”

He adds: The families went on a “Treasure Hunt” looking for items that can be recirculated.

“Nobody can promote any business in this group,” states Benazir. “It is a platform for recycling and reusing used items.”

Benazir explains that at first, the initiative reached out to three NGOs by donating old clothes for them to make masks.

“We were donating bags and bags of clothes. But how long can we be giving away only clothes?” says Benazir.

By then, she realised it would be a great idea to try to tackle a challenge people faced while relocating. These people struggled to find takers for items they wanted sold quickly for a nominal price.

In the middle of Chennai’s information-technology heartland, Elcot Avenue with its mix of gated communities and independent bungalows, often has a family relocating abroad or to a different Indian metro on work. Benazir says many a time she has noticed huge mattresses in good condition being thrown by the side of garbage bins.

“When I would try to find out the reason, I would invariably learn that there were no takers for these things. Sometimes, in our car park, there would be items abandoned by a family that is moving out,” says Benazir, who lives in a gated community. “By finding takers for these items within the community itself, the problem of transport is automatically addressed. It would be just a case of moving the items around the complex.”

Benazir admits to being inspired by a couple of community-driven “decluttering” initiatives in Mumbai.

The group has largely restricted DEA to Elcot Avenue and surrounding areas, because, as Benazir puts it, the community here has a strong three R’s culture (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle).

Strict guidelines

The WhatsApp group is not operated by a laundry list of guidelines; but from what the admins say about the ones in operation, these are cut in gabbro-stone.

“Anyone offering an used item and those keen on buying it can’t have a discussion over the sale in the group. They have to take the transaction to their private chat. We also don’t encourage too much talk, and so, anyone posting an item should present one or more pics (in a collage) and pair it to a short description along with a mention of the price,” elaborates Benazir.

There are regular instances of an owner of an item choosing to just give it away, for free.

“My daughter had a huge telescope costing ₹5,500, which we had bought on a whim and a fancy, and we knew she was not going to use it. I said I was not going to sell it, but give it away to a child who was really interested in astronomy. So, I asked if anyone was interested and asked them to message me. I said I would speak to the child to gauge their interest in astronomy. One child was identified, and the telescope was given free to her,” says Benazir.

She notes that there are cases of items having been devoured ravenously under a minute. Apparently, a lady put out 12 artefacts for free, and they were taken in two ticks of the clock.

“Lightening sales and quick disposals have made this a very popular and most sought-after avenue of recycling, for the 2500 residents of this community,” says Ramaswamy, one of the administrators of the group.

Under the overpowering shadow of the pandemic, there is always a risk attached to people dropping in to inspect items offered for sale (or for free), how is the safety question addressed?

Benazir says “everyone takes responsibility for maintaining social distancing and sanitising” and meeting all the necessary safety requirements.

A list

In a written note, Ramaswamy shares a list giving a picture of the kind of used and unused items that over the last three months have been finding ready takers:

“School and college textbooks; computer software programme books; computer accessories; used and unused furniture items ranging from a kids table to sofas and dining tables; used and unused electronic household items and kitchen ware ranging from a simple stove to ovens, fridges and ACs and water purifiers; console games, music systems including speakers and MP players and even gramaphone and LP records; guitars, harmoniums, mouth organs, violins, tablas and banjos; baby items such as play mats, cribs and bassinets; CDs of Comics and cartoons along with educational aids like blackboards; and then cycles, two-wheelers and even cars.”

Sometimes, a sale can provide a peek into a career and even a life plan.

“I came to know that a high-flying executive from the community had retired early when he had put up swanky and elegant Samsonite and Aristocrat suitcases for sale through this forum,” says Ramaswamy. “I believe Declutter Elcot Avenue has come to stay in our community. The virus may go away or not but this viral sale medium has come to stay with us.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/917kqb/article32935479.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25dc-elcotavenue,https://www.thehindu.com/society/have-you-ever-considered-putting-your-community-on-a-declutter-diet/article32935480.ece
36,2020/10/24,‘COVID-19 spurring digital adoption’,"Technology is now central, says Dell

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has compelled companies to embrace technologies and systems that have accelerated the pace of digital transformation worldwide, Michael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies, said in a recent virtual address.

“Ten months ago, few of us had ever heard of coronavirus. Now, just about every aspect of our lives has been upended. There is a heartbreaking story of lives lost, shuttered businesses, and rising unemployment. In that moment, the global economy has pivoted and the stories of passion and resilience have been inspiring,” said Mr. Dell, founder of the eponymous IT company. “Technology has never been more central than it is right now.”

‘In three months’

The pandemic had spurred firms to re-imagine their businesses. “For many enterprises, digital three-year plans got done in three months... The digital transformation will only accelerate from here, with the combination of massive computing power, 5G, and AI. It’s like a machine. The fuel for that is data; with everything becoming intelligent and connected, the relevance of data will explode.”

Asserting that the data era had arrived, he said organisations needed to accelerate their digital transformation. “5G is the digital fabric that allows us to extend the cloud to the mobile edge,” he said.

Dell was now focussed on offering its products and solutions ‘as a service’, the CEO said. “In the past year, we’ve seen very strong growth in our as-a-service offerings. Now, we will deliver all products and solutions as a service in an effort we are calling, Project Apex, so you can consume solutions anywhere you want, pay as you use, pay as you go or subscribe. We are full speed ahead at building the essential infrastructure for the data era, towards accelerating digital transformation with solutions that are automated, intelligent and integrated,” Mr. Dell added.

‘More sustainable’

“People have asked for years, what happens if everyone works from home? Well, now we’re finding out. The more we can virtualise travel, interaction, collaboration, communication, the greener, more sustainable, and more productive we become,” Mr. Dell said.

“This can also be a launchpad to address social disparities. A highly distributed workforce broadens the reach of opportunity. Advances in telemedicine and long-distance learning are breakthrough opportunities to broaden access to care and education. It’s not one size fits all. But overall, we’ve just jumped ahead to a more digital future, and we’re not going back.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/s9o4lo/article32937474.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th23BUMichael-Dell-Chairman-and-CEO,https://www.thehindu.com/business/covid-19-spurring-digital-adoption/article32937477.ece
37,2020/10/24,GuruQ to collaborate with small rural schools,"GuruQ, an online and home tutoring platform, has announced to collaborate with small rural schools to better quality of education as such schools don’t have resources similar to urban areas.

Under its initiative to ‘Educate every child,’ the firm has chalked out plans to expand in small rural villages of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha.

“GuruQ is aiming to reach out to 100 such schools in a year and almost educating 30,000 students in a year,” it said.

With tuition fees which starts from ₹50/hour, the firm that helps students connect with tutors, focuses on syllabus as well as on improving skills of students.

Started in 2016 by Minal Anand, its CEO, the firm offers classes via both online and offline mode.

It provides tutors for K-12 students, and students who wish to crack competitive exams such as CLAT, NEET, JEE Main and Advanced, students who wish to study foreign languages like German, Spanish, Russian, Italian and Chinese as well as students who want to crack entrance exams to study in foreign universities.

Without offering video tutorials, it facilitates interaction between tutors and students to get every concept explained.

39,2020/10/24,"Punjab rape and murder | Unlike U.P., Congress-ruled Punjab did not deny incident or block justice, says Rahul Gandhi","Rahul Gandhi hits back a BJP over rape of minor at Hoshiarpur

Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday hit back at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the rape of a minor at Hoshiarpur in Congress-ruled Punjab, and asserted that, unlike the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress government has not denied the incident or threatened the family of the victim.

Mr. Gandhi, in a tweet said he would go to “fight for justice” in these States as well, if they blocked justice.

“Unlike in UP, the governments of Punjab and Rajasthan are NOT denying that the girl was raped, threatening her family and blocking the course of justice. If they do, I will go there to fight for justice,” Mr. Gandhi said on Twitter with the hashtag #Hathras

Earlier, in the day, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had targeted Mr. Gandhi, and his sister and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, for “selective outrage” over rape, and their silence over the gruesome incident of a rape and murder of a minor in Punjab.

Ms. Sitharaman had also accused the Congress leaders of visiting the Hathras rape and murder victim’s family as if they were going to a “picnic”.

At a press conference, Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev accused the BJP of playing politics over the Hoshiarpur incident because of the Bihar Assembly elections, and targeted Ms. Sitharaman and her colleagues Prakash Javadekar and Harsh Vardhan for questioning the Hathras visit of the Congress leaders.

“I hope that Nirmala Sitharaman-ji will stop displaying her total insensitiveness to such a sensitive issue. Don’t politicise it,” she said, adding, “The nation understands that you have suddenly woken up from your deep sleep because Bihar is in an election mode. There is no second reason. Your party, your leaders and even Prime Minister Narendra Modi do not see beyond elections and that is why all of a sudden you have decided to make Hoshiarpur an issue.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7h31zo/article32937432.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-Rahul,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/unlike-up-congress-ruled-punjab-did-not-deny-incident-or-block-justice-says-rahul-gandhi/article32937442.ece
40,2020/10/24,"Carbine deal a benchmark to invest in India, says UAE arms firm Caracal","UAE's state-owned arms manufacturer firm keen to set up facilities.

The deal for 93,895 Close Quarter Carbines (CQBs) for the Indian Army, for which United Arab Emirates (UAE)’s government-owned small arms manufacturer Caracal was shortlisted, is like a “benchmark” for UAE industry and they are watching closely on further investments in the Indian market, said Hamad Salem Alameri, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Caracal in an interview to The Hindu.

“Once this first contract moves, lot of sister companies within the group will see this as a success story and people will have the confidence to come and invest in India,” Mr. Alameri said. He said this was the most important message that everyone is looking at and people are willing to come and invest in India and create jobs with the blessings of the two governments.

However, while Caracal was shortlisted two years back, the final deal has been delayed and recently an in-principle decision was taken in the Defence Ministry to cancel the deal and take the domestic route for procurement. But no formal announcement has been made so far.

“Nothing came to us officially on the cancellation or on the intent of cancellation,” Mr. Alameri said.

He said in the last two years Caracal had developed lot of suppliers and technology partners and the starting point of indigenisation will be 60%. Stating that Caracal has already identified four locations to set up the facility and also identified local partners to be able to commence production immediately, Mr. Alameri said India is already part of their global supply chain and over 20% of the components fitted on the CAR 816 are already made in India.

The deals for 72,400 assault rifles and 93,895 carbines were approved by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) in January 2018 to be processed through the Fast Track Procurement (FTP) route. While the deal for assault rifles was concluded with Sig Saur and SIG-716 assault rifles delivered to the Army, the CQB deal in which Caracal was selected has been held up. The total number CQBs required is much larger given the Army’s requirement.

Caracal was among two of five contenders who qualified in the trials, from which it was declared the lowest bidder as its bid was $26 mn less than the competitor, Mr. Alameri said. As part of the evaluation, an Army team conducted trials at the vendors’ facilities and later the carbines were tested in India with local ammunition to check compatibility.

Caracal which is looking to expand its presence in the Indian market, is now bidding for the Sniper rifles tender of the Army and also looking to supply sub-machine guns to the Home Ministry, Mr. Alameri added.

The CAR-816 carbines meant to replace the Army’s 9mm Sterling carbines in service and have higher bullet velocity and reduced weight compared to the Sterling carbines. Caracal has already said it is positioned to complete the order within 12 months.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tn2pyz/article32937902.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CloseQuarterCAR816Carbinejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/carbine-deal-a-benchmark-for-uae-firms-to-invest-in-india/article32936643.ece
41,2020/10/24,"Union Minister Kishan Reddy hails ITBP, says it broke the myth about some countries’ strong armies","His jibe was aimed at China.

The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), in developments that took place in the last few months, has broken the myth of some countries that they have a powerful army, Union Minister G Kishan Reddy said on Saturday, in an indirect reference to the ongoing standoff between India and China in Ladakh.

The Minister of State for Home was addressing the troops of the mountain warfare-trained border force on the occasion of its 59th raising day in Greater Noida.

He did not take names but said while India believes in the philosophy of “vasudhaiva kutumbakam” or the world is one family, the culture of the country teaches it to worship both “shastra and astra” or sacred scriptures and weapons at the same time.

“This has taught us that the enemy can raise its head anytime, anywhere and we should be fully prepared to face any possibility. The ITBP is an important pillar of that preparedness of the country,” Mr. Reddy said.

“The armies of some countries had a myth that they were among the powerful armies of the world, but during the developments in the past few months, the ITBP has broken that myth,” he added.

The country and its citizens are proud of the ITBP’s valour and dedication, the Minister said.

The ITBP is the designated force to guard the 3,488-km-long Sino-India Line of Actual Control (LAC) that runs from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh in the northeastern flank of the country.

The Army and the border-guarding force are engaged in a military standoff in the Ladakh region for the past few months. The ITBP had sometime ago said it “fought the whole night” and gave a befitting reply to the Chinese PLA troops during a violent clash between the two sides on June 15-16.

Mr. Reddy said the force not only mans the borders and ensures the internal security of the country, but also protects its economic interests.

“India is surrounded by a hostile neighbourhood and our enemy, time and again, puts obstacles to stop our economic development. When you defeat these designs of the enemy, you ensure the country’s economic development,” he said.

Mr. Reddy said the Narendra Modi government is “determined” to strengthen and “modernise” the force, and informed about certain sanctions given to it in the recent past.

“I am happy to inform that the ITBP has been given the approval by the Ministry of Home Affairs to establish 47 border posts, uniform special clothing and mountaineering equipment for high-altitude locations, latest weapons are being provided and work is on to prepare priority border roads for the force,” he said.

The Minister said the Centre had approved a budget of ₹7,223 crore for the force for financial year 2019-20.

“I assure you that there will be no dearth of funds for the ITBP,” Mr. Reddy added.

ITBP Director General (DG) Surjeet Singh Deswal also spoke at the event as he lauded the bravery displayed by the troops recently in Ladakh under “very challenging circumstances“.

Mr. Deswal said he toured the Ladakh border front recently and himself honoured the gallant personnel, while adding that recommendations have been sent to the government for awarding gallantry medals to some of them who fought against the Chinese troops.

The force has left no stone unturned to guard this border, faced with challenges of weather, low temperatures and oxygen levels and a difficult terrain, he said.

Mr. Deswal said the force has finalised and sent to the Home Ministry a proposal for constructing “phase-2 of India-China border roads“.

“A proposal has also been sent to the high-level empowered committee for the creation of 18 foot-tracks in Arunachal Pradesh. We hope that the work on this will begin soon,” the ITBP chief said.

He added that the force is providing better vehicles, bullet-proof jackets and helmets, clothing and ration to its troops on the border.

New systems for better communication have been installed, Mr. Deswal said.

The ITBP was raised in the aftermath of the 1962 Chinese aggression and it has a strength of about 90,000 personnel with 60 battalions on the ground.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5pr78v/article32894733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KISHANREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mos-reddy-hails-itbp-says-it-broke-the-myth-about-some-countries-strong-armies/article32936526.ece
42,2020/10/24,Farooq Abdullah to lead Gupkar alliance,"Not anti-national but anti-BJP, stresses seven-party amalgam; adopts the flag of the erstwhile State as its symbol.

Seven mainstream parties of Jammu and Kashmir on October 24 gave formal shape to their recently cobbled alliance for the restoration of Article 370, electing National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah as its chairman and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti as vice-chairperson and asserted that theirs was “not an anti-national” grouping.

Veteran CPM leader M.Y. Tarigami was elected the convenor while Lok Sabha member from South Kashmir Hasnain Masoodi will be the coordinator of the conglomerate known as Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD).

Editorial | Valley’s voice: On J&K’s Gupkar alliance

Sajjad Gani Lone of People’s Conference would be the spokesman for the amalgam.

After a meeting held at Ms. Mufti’s house, Mr. Farooq Abdullah, who turned 84 earlier this week, said the alliance is fighting for the restoration of special status to Jammu and Kashmir and is an “anti-BJP platform” and not an anti-national amalgam.

“I want to tell you that this is false propaganda by the BJP that the PAGD is anti-national. I want to tell them that this is not true. There is no doubt that it is anti-BJP, but it is not anti-national,” he told reporters in Srinagar.

Mr. Farooq Abdullah alleged that the BJP has tried to break the federal structure through acts like the abrogation of Article 370 and dividing Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories. “They have tried to destroy the Constitution of the country, they have tried to divide the nation, to break the federal structure which we saw what they did on August 5 last year,” the NC president said.

‘BJP’s false propaganda’

“I want to tell them that this [PAGD] is not an anti-national jamaat. Our aim is that the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh should get their rights back. That’s where our battle is. Our battle is not for more than that,” he said.

Stating that the BJP was doing propaganda against the constituents of the PAGD in Jammu and elsewhere in the country, the NC leader said, “They are trying to divide us [people of Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh] in the name of religion. This attempt will not succeed. This is not a religious battle; this is a fight for our identity, and for that identity, we are standing together,” he said.

The amalgam, which met for the first time after its formation, will come out with a white paper, within one month, going into the governance in Jammu and Kashmir over the past one year, Mr. Lone told reporters after the meeting.

“The white paper will not be rhetoric. It will be based on facts and figures to present the reality to the people of Jammu and Kashmir and around the country... An impression is being given that all the corruption had happened in Jammu and Kashmir,” Mr. Lone said.

The amalgam decided to hold its next meeting after a fortnight in Jammu, followed by a convention in Srinagar on November 17. The alliance adopted the flag of the erstwhile State as its symbol.

While the Communist Party of India’s Kashmir head A.R. Trukroo joined the PAGD, Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee appears to have quietly distanced itself from the alliance.

JKPCC chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir, who was part of the meetings that took place before the formalisation of PAGD earlier this month, has skipped the last two meetings. The JKPCC had issued a statement after the previous meeting that Mr. Mir could not attend due to the advice of doctors.

BJP warning

Reacting to the announcements, Jammu and Kashmir BJP chief Ravinder Raina said, “Conspiracies of the Gupkar Gang” would not be tolerated and anyone challenging the unity and integrity of the country would be jailed.

He also announced that October 26 will be celebrated as ‘accession day’ to send a clear message that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India.

Also read | BJP demands Mehbooba Mufti’s arrest for her statement on national flag

“We will celebrate October 26, the day when Maharaja Hari Singh signed the instrument of accession, as ‘Villai Diwas’ like Diwali and freedom celebration,” the BJP leader asserted.

Hitting out at PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, the BJP leader said those feeling troubled and insecure in India should go to Pakistan as J&K is not their fiefdom. He asserted that no power on earth can restore Article 370 and the flag of the erstwhile State.

“This time we have Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah and those conspiring against the country will not be forgiven. We will give our blood and our lives for our motherland and the tricolour,” Mr. Raina, holding the national flag in his hand, told reporters in Jammu.

Responding to the PDP chief’s statement that she would only hold the tricolour when the flag of the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir is restored, the BJP leader said only the national flag will flutter in the Union territory.

Referring to the National Conference and PDP leaders, he claimed that when they are in power, they praise India, but when out of power, they remember Pakistan and China.

“They will not be allowed to take forward an anti-India agenda. Let them try, this Gupkar Gang is getting strengthened from six parties to 600, we will not allow them to fulfil their dreams. They are a bunch of power-hungry people and the people of Jammu and Kashmir know them very well...,” Mr. Raina said.

“What if Mehbooba does not hold the tricolour in her hand, there are crores of people in Jammu and Kashmir who love and respect the national flag from the core of their hearts,” he said, adding that his party would celebrate ‘accession day’ on October 26 by hoisting the tricolour and taking out rallies to send a strong message.

“... any leader who is found conspiring against the country will pay a heavy price. They cannot save themselves and Tihar jail is waiting for them,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jjptw6/article32937438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gupkarjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/farooq-abdullah-named-chairman-of-peoples-alliance-for-gupkar-declaration-mehbooba-mufti-to-be-deputy/article32936487.ece
43,2020/10/24,Punjab rape and murder | BJP questions silence of Congress leaders,"Why are Rahul, Priyanka silent on minor girl’s rape in Punjab, Nirmala Sitharaman asks.

The BJP on Saturday accused the Congress of employing “selective outrage” in cases of crimes against women, questioning the silence of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra over the alleged rape and murder of a six-year-old girl in Punjab.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, at a presser at the BJP’s national headquarters in New Delhi, also took a swipe at Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav, questioning if he had asked Mr. Gandhi about the issue while holding a joint poll campaign with him in the State. She also noted that the child hailed from the Dalit community.

Also read: Hathras, a new phase in the caste atrocity narrative

Attacking Mr. Yadav, she referred to a news report of 2008 to mention the “allegations of eve-teasing and misbehaviour with women against the RJD brothers”, a reference to him and his elder brother Tej Pratap.

“It [the Punjab incident] may not hurt the RJD because that is how things were when they were in power,” Ms. Sitharaman said adding that the RJD presided over “Jungle Raj“ during its rule between 1990-2005.

Hitting out at the Congress, she said, “The pretentious Congress has not said a word. The tweet-friendly Rahul Gandhi has not tweeted on the Hoshiarpur incident. There has been no outrage. And no picnic either.”

Her ‘picnic’ jibe was in reference to Mr. Gandhi and Ms. Gandhi’s visit to Hathras in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh following the alleged gangrape of a Dalit girl, who died in a Delhi hospital subsequently.

“The Congress party should stand up and answer. Does this kind of selective outrage suit the stature of their party? Why is the brother-sister pair not going and voicing horror in Hoshiarpur? Why not in Rajasthan? The selective cry of outrage that the Congress wants to show when it is elsewhere but not in States governed by it is completely exposed,” Ms. Sitharaman said.

Stating that crimes like rape should not be politicised, she said certain political parties are selective in voicing horror.

In a horrifying incident, a six-year-old girl was allegedly raped, killed and then set on fire, with her half-burnt body found at a home in Tanda’s Jalalpur village, police said on Thursday.

The accused — Gurpreet Singh and his grandfather Surjit Singh — have been arrested on the charges of murder, rape and under other Sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, they said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kgrreu/article32936382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIRMALASITHARAMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-shows-selective-outrage-in-cases-of-crimes-against-women-says-nirmala-sitharaman/article32936383.ece
44,2020/10/24,PM Modi inaugurates three projects in Gujarat,"Launches 2.3 km-long ropeway project on Mount Girnar near Junagadh city a major pilgrimage site

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated three projects in his home State Gujarat — one each related to farmers’ welfare, healthcare, and tourism development — via video conference from New Delhi.

PM Modi launched the ‘Kisan Suryodaya Yojana’ aimed at providing day-time electricity to farmers in the State for irrigation and farming purposes. The second project he inaugurated is a paediatric heart hospital at the U.N. Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre in Ahmedabad, developed with an investment of ₹470 crore by the State’s Health Department.

The third project the PM launched is a 2.3 km-long ropeway project on Mount Girnar in Junagadh city, a major pilgrimage site. The ropeway project is being touted as the longest temple ropeway in Asia. The 2.3 km Girnar ropeway has been developed by Usha Breco Limited at an investment of ₹130 crore.

In his address on the occasion, Mr. Modi said, “The world class ropeway will make it convenient for more people to visit Girnar. Earlier, it used to take five-seven hours to climb Girnar, but now it will take only seven-eight minutes. More devotees and tourists will visit Girnar. It will give a boost to adventure activities. I am also happy that the project will create more employment opportunities for local youths.”

The Girnar ropeway is a state-of-the-art passenger ropeway comprising 25 cabins, including one glass-floored cabin, each having the capacity to carry eight passengers at a time. The ropeway will ferry 800 people in an hour, and 8,000 in a day.

During his online inaugural address, PM Modi slammed the Opposition over the delay in completion of the ropeway project.

“Had they not created hurdles in [the building of the] Girnar ropeway, it would not have stalled for so many years. People and tourists should have got the benefit of it a long time back,” he said, adding that the project not implemented due to controversies related to environment and other factors.

Mr. Khandu was speaking at a programme on Friday at Bum La, a pass on the Indo-Tibet border in the northeastern state, to honour a soldier who died fighting in the 1962 India-China war.

“This is not 1962, but 2020, and things are different now. Right from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh, we are fully prepared. If required, the people of Arunachal will not hesitate to stand behind the Indian Army,” he said.

China does not recognise Arunachal Pradesh as an Indian state but as a part of southern Tibet, a claim that has been rejected outright by India.

Speaking on the changes in the last six decades since 1962, the chief minister said infrastructure development along the border areas has received a major thrust under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“The development of border areas, specially roads, is important. It is being done in full speed in Arunachal Pradesh and we will soon witness several such infrastructural revamps in the state,” he said.

Mr. Khandu was at Bum La to pay tribute to Subedar Joginder Singh on his 58th death anniversary. He recalled the supreme sacrifice of Singh, who laid down his life fighting the Chinese army in the 1962 Indo-China war.

Singh, who was a subedar in the 1st battalion of the Sikh Regiment, was commanding a platoon at Bum La in the then North East Frontier Agency, now Arunachal Pradesh.

“Fighting against all odds, Subedar Singh attained martyrdom on this day during the 1962 India-China war. The people of Arunachal salute his bravery and will always remember the supreme sacrifice he made for the nation,” Mr. Khandu said.

Though heavily outnumbered, Singh had led his troops against a Chinese assault and defended his post until he was wounded and captured. He died of his injuries while in Chinese custody and is believed to have single-handedly killed several Chinese soldiers and created history in the annals of the Indian Army.

He was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, the highest military gallantry award of the country, in 1962.

Kulwant Kaur, Singh’s daughter, inaugurated a newly-built war memorial in her father’s name at the programme.

The memorial has been built by the Arunachal Pradesh government just below the famous IB Ridge to commemorate Singh’s heroic defence against the People’s Liberation Army of China.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/zauz0j/article32935379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Khandu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/times-now-different-from-1962-says-arunachal-cm-pema-khandu/article32935370.ece

“That is why we deeply appreciate to be a part of this discussion and will continue to work alongside governments and regulators to find the right solutions which not only protect users’ privacy but are also interoperable with other major global privacy regulations” the company spokesperson said.

The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) on Friday said the revision of the base year for the consumer price index for industrial workers (CPI-IW) from 2001 to 2016 announced by Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar would lead to suppression of the real impact of price rise, harming the interests of workers.

“The entire exercise made by the Labour Bureau functioning under the Ministry of Labour on this matter has been thoroughly arbitrary, deliberately designed to suppress the real impact of the price rise of essential items for human survival and also to deprive the workers of their entitlement for legitimate DA [dearness allowance],” a statement by CITU general secretary Tapan Sen said.

The bureau had ignored the fact that prices of essential items, in particular food, were on the rise, while reducing the weight given to food items in the consumption basket from 46.2% to 39%, the CITU said.

“The Minister’s statement justifying this arbitrary reduction as change in the consumption pattern of the working people away from food item is ridiculous and cruel inhuman joke,” the statement said.

The CITU said employers had been asking the government to freeze the variable DA payment to workers as a relief to them during the economic slowdown and that the revision in base year had provided the employers that through the backdoor.

49,2020/10/24,"Right to travel abroad is part of fundamental right to dignity, personal liberty: Supreme Court","This right cannot be merely illusory, says Bench

The Supreme Court has held that the right to travel abroad is an inseverable part of the fundamental right to dignity and personal liberty.

This right cannot be merely “illusory”. A recent judgment by a Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud decided the “interesting” question whether a court can make the ban on travelling abroad a condition for granting bail.

The appellant, Parvez Noordin Lokhandwalla, wanted leeway to visit the U.S. to revalidate his green card.

The competent court is empowered to exercise its discretion to impose “any condition” for the grant of bail under Sections 437 (3) and 439 (1) (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Justice Chandrachud noted.

However, this discretion of the court has to be “guided by the need to facilitate the administration of justice, secure the presence of the accused and ensure that the liberty of the accused is not misused to impede the investigation, overawe the witnesses or obstruct the course of justice.”

The nature of the risk has to be carefully weighed by the courts individually in each case for permission to travel abroad while out on bail. The conditions for the grant of permission have to balance both the public interest in the enforcement of criminal justice with the rights of the accused.

“The human right to dignity and the protection of constitutional safeguards should not become illusory by the imposition of conditions which are disproportionate to the need to secure the presence of the accused, the proper course of investigation and eventually to ensure a fair trial,” Justice Chandrachud cautioned.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/but1ck/article32922040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THSC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/right-to-travel-abroad-is-part-of-fundamental-right-to-dignity-personal-liberty-supreme-court/article32933800.ece

53,2020/10/24,Government is not vindictive: Minister,"‘GITAM university is not a charitable organisation’

Reiterating that the government is not vindictive, Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao has accused the TDP for raising a hue and cry unnecessarily over the “reclaiming of government land” from GITAM deemed to be University.

Addressing the media here on Saturday, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said the university was not a charitable organisation.

“It charges exorbitant fee from the students and does not follow the rule of reservation. The government has reclaimed only the encroached extent as per the guidelines,” the Minister said.

Wondering why the land was not regularised during the TDP term, the Minister claimed that many TDP leaders too had objected to the institution’s “illegal land encroachments.”

Accusing the TDP leaders of creating hurdles in the path of development, the Minister said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was trying to strengthen government institutions unlike former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu who had worked for the benefit of private organisations.

Earlier, at a separate press conference, YSRCP Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath alleged that the TDP was batting for those who had encroached nearly 40 acres of government land worth ₹800 crore in the city.

Refuting the university’s claim that it was not issued prior notice, Mr. Amarnath said that five months ago, surveyors of the Revenue Department had conducted a survey and informed the university management that 40 acres of government land fell within the campus compound and that it would be reclaimed.

In the year 2014, when Mr. Naidu was the Chief Minister, the university had applied for alienation of the land, he said.

“How can the government consider if someone first encroaches land worth crores of rupees and then applies for regularisation?” he questioned.

‘SIT report soon’

Alleging that huge amounts of money had been swindled and vast extents of land encroached during the TDP term, the MLA said, “The YSRCP, then in the Opposition, had questioned the TDP over the encroachments in Vizag. Had we not mounted pressure, the Dasapalla Hills area in the city would have turned into a concrete jungle by now.”

Under pressure from the YSRCP, the TDP government was forced to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the land scam. However, it did not make the SIT report public. The YSRCP, after coming to power, had constituted another SIT. Its report will be out very soon,” he added.

“Anybody involved in grabbing government land will face similar consequences,” the MLA warned.

Pendurthi MLA Adeep Raj said, though GITAM was involved in several irregularities, the TDP government had not taken any action, considering the family relationship between members of the university management, Mr. Naidu and TDP leader N. Balakrishna.

Accusing the TDP of politicising the issue, he said the government was not targeting the opposition leaders.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/government-is-not-vindictive-minister/article32937879.ece
54,2020/10/24,Jagan adopting vindictive politics: Ayyanna,"‘Demolition machinery getting active on Saturdays to target properties of TDP leaders’

Senior TDP leaders on Saturday hit back at the YSRCP government for demolishing a part of campus of GITAM deemed to be University here on the pretext that it was government land.

Addressing the media at the university, former Minister Ayyanna Patrudu said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was resorting to “vindictive and revenge politics” by targeting the TDP leaders.

“When Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy was the Chief Minister of the combined State, he had tried to demolish a part of the campus. After realising that it would be wrong on the part of the government to destroy an educational institution, he had revoked the order and restored the land. Mr. Jagan should take a cue from this and learn to respect educational and religious institutions,” he said.

“TDP leader and GITAM founder M.V.V.S. Murthi had approached the Rosaiah-led Congress government in the combined State seeking regularisation of about 37 acres of government land that fell within the GITAM Medical College campus at government rate. But the government did not oblige. The institution that has nurtured lakhs of students is being punished because its present president Sribharat is the grandson of Murthi,” Mr. Patrudu alleged.

“The machinery used for demolition purposes become active every Saturday to target the houses and institutions of the TDP leaders. Saturday is chosen as the courts do not function on that day and the aggrieved cannot approach it for a stay order,” he observed.

‘CM should introspect’

“The Chief Minister should embark on self introspection and know about the number of criminal cases pending against him before pointing fingers at others,” said another former Minister Bandaru Satyanaryana Murthy.

GITAM Medical College had rendered yeoman service when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak and had even served as district COVID hospital, he said, and added that “it is still serving the patients, but this was the treatment meted to the institution. MLA Pala Srinivas was present.

‘Act of revenge’

Staff Reporter in Vijayawada writes: TDP Polit Bureau member K. Kala Venkata Rao condemned the demolition of the alleged encroachments at GITAM institution. In a release, he termed it as an “atrocious act of revenge” by the YSRCP government against an institution that had bagged many awards. “While the TDP government had bagged awards for development, the YSRCP government is excelling in destructive activities,” he observed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jagan-adopting-vindictive-politics-ayyanna/article32937869.ece

Farmers in Prakasam district who pray every year for good rains are now cursing their fate.

The drought-ridden district has seen deficient monsoons every other year. However, the monsoon this year was above normal, with the district getting 74.8% excess rainfall in the month of September alone, enabling farmers to grow crops in an extent of 5.38 lakh acres during Khariff.

However, they were in for a rude shock as the rains in the second week of October and the subsequent floods left most of the crops damaged.

Standing crops, including chilli, cotton, black gram, green gram and cow pea, in over 26,000 acres have been damaged, mostly in Markapur division.

Counting the losses, All India Kisan Sangarsh Coordination Committee district convener Chundri Ranga Rao said farmers in western Prakasam had just started a few rounds of plucking in his cotton field. The rains came at the most inopportune time, making it impossible to complete plucking of the ready-to-harvest crop.

Over 20,000 farmers in 19 mandals who had taken up cultivation of chilli, red gram, maize and sesame, are ruing their fate as the rains according to an assessment by the Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangam (APRS) had caused a loss of ₹300 crore so far.

Productivity in paddy fields is likely to drop to 20 quintals per acre as against the normal 30 quintals. Farmers now have to spend three times more for removal of excessive weeds and increased pest attack following the heavy rains.

Expecting handsome returns in the wake of the spice crop’s price going northwards in global markets, chilli growers had spent at least ₹50,000 per acre so far. But the heavy rains had dashed all their hopes, explained APRS district secretary Vadde Hanuma Reddy.

Heavy rains and flash floods also left a trail of destruction in the district, damaging 224.35 km of roads,including a maximum of 148.25 km of road surface in Ongole R&B division. The damage to roads was about 35 km in Kanigiri division and another 37.3 km, according to R&B Superintending Engineer P. Maheswar Reddy.

Installations relating to government property including power and irrigation departments were also badly damaged, requiring ₹14.13 crore for temporary repairs and ₹103.28 crore for carrying out permanent repairs, said District Revenue Officer K. Vinayakam.

61,2020/10/24,No question of diluting free power scheme: Balineni,"‘Farm meters aimed at ensuring quality supply’

Allaying fears of farmers over fixing of smart meters to pump-sets, Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy on Friday made it clear that the free power scheme to the farmers would be continued at any cost.

Addressing a district-level electricity committee meeting here along with his Cabinet colleague A. Suresh, the Energy Minister said there was no question of the YSRCP government diluting the free power scheme introduced by the former Chief Minister, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, in the undivided Andhra Pradesh.

The metering of farm pump-sets had been taken up as part of reforms in the electricity department with a view to ensuring quality power to the farmers, he explained, adding that it was due to wrong policies of the previous TDP government that the department was saddled with debts to the tune of ₹75,000 crore.

The meters would be provided free of cost to the farmers, and a separate bank account would be opened for them for crediting the amount towards settling the power bill to the distribution companies. The State government was focusing on switching over to solar power in a big way to sustain the free power scheme, he explained.

Power tariff for aqua units had been brought down to ₹1.50 per unit to make their produce competitive, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/no-question-of-diluting-free-power-scheme-balineni/article32933448.ece

63,2020/10/24,Decision on local body polls after December: Minister,"‘We need to be cautious as second COVID wave is expected’

The government will take a decision on conducting elections to the local bodies after December as the number of COVID-19 cases is expected to rise in the next two months, Industries Minister M. Goutham Reddy has said.

“We are now witnessing a lull. It is expected that the virus will intensify as the festivals draw to a close,” the Minister observed while addressing the media here on Friday.

Mr. Goutham Reddy said there could be a second wave, and the government needed to be cautious.

Experts had been warning of an upsurge, the government would, therefore, not take a hasty decision on the elections, he added.

Asked what was preventing the government from holding the elections when Bihar was going to the polls in spite of the prevalence of COVID-19, Mr. Goutham Reddy said the Assembly elections there had to be conducted as per the statutory requirement. “It is not proper to make a comparison between the local body polls in A.P. and the elections in Bihar,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/decision-on-local-body-polls-after-december-minister/article32933414.ece
64,2020/10/24,Tobacco auctions end on a dull note,"Untimely rain and pandemic adversely impact farmers; Markfed intervention brings little relief

FCV tobacco auctions in 2020 have ended on a dull note with only 128.65 million kg out of the fixed crop size of 136 million kg marketed at an average price of ₹123.95 per kg, which is higher than the previous year’s price by just ₹2.42.

The year began on a bleak note for the farmers with untimely rains. The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in March resulted in a prolonged lockdown and suspension of auctions.

With major players shying away from the auctions citing low quality in the SLS and SBS platforms, the State government was forced to press the AP Markfed as a buyer and started purchasing the FCV tobacco from July. The Markfed’s role was limited as it purchased just 12.93 million kg at an average price of ₹81 per kg.

Double whammy

It was a double whammy for the farmers this year as the Tobacco Board decided to further trim the crop size. The board’s role too appeared to be waning as the average prices hit an all-time low, forcing the State government to intervene.

The board said it had taken 175 days to complete the auctions. In the latter half of the year, auctions were held in accordance with the COVID-19 protocol.

Tobacco Board Executive Director R. Muthuraj congratulated the stakeholders who cooperated in the successful completion of auctions despite the pandemic and helped realise a higher price over the previous year.

“Untimely rains during the harvesting stage (first week of January) caused damage to the standing crop, which resulted in poor grade out-turn and higher proportion of low-grade varieties. The impact was higher in the Southern Black Soil and Southern Light Soil regions. In the SLS and SBS regions, the production of low-grade tobacco was high,” he said.

Auctions for sale of 2019-20 FCV tobacco had commenced from February in a phased manner. After sale of 4.47 million kg, auctions were temporarily suspended from March 22, 2020, due to COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdown. Auctions, however, resumed on April 27 at five platforms followed by all the other 18 platforms by May.

After resumption of auctions in Andhra Pradesh in the last week of April, though the bright grade fetched better prices, there was a price drop for medium grade in the SBS and SLS regions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tobacco-auctions-end-on-a-dull-note/article32933408.ece
65,2020/10/24,"Top priority to nine-hour free power supply to farm sector, says Balineni","‘₹1,700 crore sanctioned for upgrading agriculture feeders’

Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy has said that utmost priority is being accorded to supplying power to the agriculture sector for nine hours during day time to give a boost to the rural economy.

The ultimate aim was to create a robust power sector by strengthening the power utilities and make Andhra Pradesh a destination for cost-effective power, Mr. Srinivasa Reddy said in a release on Friday.

The government sanctioned ₹1,700 crore for upgrading the agriculture feeders in tune with the importance given to the nine-hour free supply, he said.

AP-Transco had undertaken infrastructure development works for better implementation of the scheme, the Minister said, and added that the government intended to make free power to the farmers a permanent scheme.

Solar plant

Mr. Srinivasa Reddy further said that the government was in the process of establishing a 10,000 MW solar power plant to exclusively cater to agriculture.

“The government is spending ₹8,354 crore on the free power scheme that will benefit 18.50 lakh agriculture connections. This apart, ₹718 crore is being provided for supplying power at subsidised rates to the aqua farmers,” he said.

Besides, the government released 65,565 new agriculture connections in 2019-20.

As part of the efforts to improve the precarious finances of the distribution companies (Discoms), the government released ₹17,904 crore in 2019-20 towards clearing their subsidy arrears.

Out of subsidy arrears of ₹13,391 crore pending as on March 31, 2019, the government released ₹8,655 crore in 2019-20 and ₹9,249 crore towards subsidy announced in 2019-20 and other charges.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/top-priority-to-nine-hour-free-power-supply-to-farm-sector-says-balineni/article32933391.ece
66,2020/10/24,"YSRCP govt. drifting aimlessly over Polavaram project, says Congress","‘Progress of work not updated on the website after Jan 2019’

The Congress has said that the YSRCP government is ‘drifting aimlessly’ when it comes to completion of the Polavaram irrigation project.

Taking potshots at the ruling party, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Gidugu Rudra Raju sought to know why the YSRCP government had decided to proceed with the project, despite demanding its execution by the Centre when it was in the opposition.

‘Unilateral decision’

The government unilaterally changed the contractors for the project without the nod of Polavaram Project Authority or the Centre, he said on Friday. “Even as the Centre had declined to release funds for the project until the State properly accounts for the ₹5136 crore spent prior to 2014, the YSRCP government appears to be undecided on moving ahead,” said Mr. Rudra Raju.

He claimed that the previous government had uploaded project details on its website only after the Congress exerted pressure. However, the details have not been updated after January 2019.

“Though the authority has met eleven times till date, minutes of only those meetings held during the TDP regime are available in the public domain. This tells all about the transparency in the government,” the AICC secretary lamented.

Mr. Rudra Raju also accused the YSRCP government of shying away from revealing the details of the expert committee and dam development review committee meetings.

‘No counter filed in HC’

Referring to the petition filed by MP K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao in the High Court, seeking the Centre bear the entire expenditure of the Polavaram project, Mr. Rudra Raju wondered why the erstwhile TDP and the present YSRCP governments had failed to file a counter, which he said would have benefited the State.

The Prakasam police on Friday arrested three people including two from Karnataka on charge of duping people by selling fake gold ornaments.

The accused have been identified as Govindu Kalyan Nayak (23), J.Sivaiah (30) and Gowrappa (35).

“One of the accused introduced himself as Ravi to Bojja Adam of Nagambotlapalem village near Tallur, saying that his brother, an earth-mover operator, had unearthed gold from a farm near Madurai in Tamil Nadu. Ravi allegedly told Mr. Adam that he wanted to sell the gold at cheap price as he was in urgent need of money,” Ongole DSP K.V.V.N.V. Prasad said.

Modus operandi

M. Adam mentioned in the police complainant that he met the brother of the accused at ABM College on October 2 . The brother allegedly got checked a piece of gold ornament by a gold smith. Mr. Adam paid him ₹1 lakh as advance and paid ₹6 lakh at the time of delivery of the gold.

Mr. Adam went to Palamaner in Chittoor district where the accused gave him a plastic bag containing the ornaments weighing 2 kg. Mr. Adam realised that he was cheated when he found the gold fake.

He approached the II Town police in Ongle on October 15 after all his efforts to contact the accused were in vain.

Prakasam Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal formed two special teams which arrested the accused at Obli village near Kolar and Yerapothunahalli village near Chikballapur in Karnataka.

Investigation revealed that the accused had cheated several persons in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka in the past by adopting the same modus operandi.

The Dakshina Kannada district police on Saturday shot at a murder accused injuring his leg and later arrested him. The police gave his name as Khaleel, accused of the murder of one Umar Farooq alias Chenna Farooq in Bantwal town police limits on Friday evening.

Farooq, 28, a resident of Kalladka with criminal background, was hacked to death allegedly by a gang led by Khaleel at Bogodi Gudde Angadi near Panemangaluru on Friday evening after hitting the victim’s two-wheeler with their car. Old rivalry was said to be the reason behind the attack. The police immediately barricaded all exit points from the district to apprehend the accused, who were planning to flee.

DK Superintendent of Police constituted a special team under Bantwal Circle Inspect of Police and comprising Sub Inspectors of Police from Bantwal town, Rural and Uppinangady police stations. The team got information on Saturday morning that the accused were on their way towards Bengaluru on NH 75 and intercepted their car at Gundya in Puttur taluk.

While the police were securing the accused, Khaleel allegedly assaulted the team members with a sharp weapon injuring Bantwal Rural PSI Prasanna. This forced Bantwal Town PSI Avinash to open fire at the accused. While Khaleel was arrested, other accused managed to flee, a communiqué from DK Police said. Khaleel was a native of Kalladka and presently resides at Nandavara.

The police are on the lookout for the remaining accused.

Farooq had allegedly told Khaleel’s father a few days ago that he would eliminate the latter’s son even as both had been friends earlier. Infuriated with the threat, Khaleel reportedly invited Farooq to his place, Nandavara in the pretext of discussion.

70,2020/10/24,Ullal CMC stops collecting non-segregated waste at doorstep,"This is being followed since a fortnight, says Commissioner

Ullal City Municipality has stopped collecting waste from the doorsteps of people if segregated waste is not handed over to it, according to its commissioner Rayappa.

“We are doing so since past fortnight,” he told The Hindu adding that hence many people have now begun segregating waste. The dry and wet waste is being collected daily from its 27 wards, he said.

The civic body had entered into an agreement with a Bengaluru-based NGO to process the dry waste collected daily from the houses. Other waste material collectors have also been told to hand over dry waste to the NGO, he said. Dry waste collected in the jurisdiction of the municipality was between 2 and 2.5 tonnes daily. The civic body collected about five tonnes of wet waste daily, which is being transported to Mangaluru City Corporation’s compost plant at Pachchanady.

A private chicken waste processing unit at Baikampady collected about three tonnes of chicken waste daily from the municipality area. It made animal feed and oil used in soap manufacturing industry from it, the commissioner said.

Mr. Rayappa said the municipality will set up a dry waste collection centre that is expected to be operational after a month.

Four dry waste centres

Meanwhile, the Mangaluru City Corporation has proposed setting up four dry waste collection centres under Swachh Bharat Mission in the city. Of them two are being constructed at Kavoor and Madhavanagar in Surathkal. Their structures are being built on the premises of sewage treatment plants, said Madhu S. Manohar, environment engineer at the corporation.

The land for two more centres is yet to be finalised. Tentatively, land had been identified at Jeppinamogaru and Mannagudda. Those centres will be managed by NGOs. It has been planned to divert the dry waste collected by the contractor of the corporation every Friday to those centres for further segregation and to send material to recyclers.

A day after heavy rains brought the city to its knees, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa inspected various affected areas.

Accompanied by Revenue Minister R. Ashok, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Administrator Gaurav Gupta and Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad, the Chief Minister announced a relief of ₹25,000 for each house that was inundated.

Mr. Yediyurappa, who also holds the Bengaluru Development portfolio, directed the civic officials to identify the beneficiaries and begin distributing the compensation cheques immediately.

In Dattatreya Nagar alone, coming under Hosakerehalli ward, nearly 700 houses were inundated. It was during his inspection in Dattatreya Nagar that many residents demanded that he inspect the houses in the low-lying area that were flooded. Though Mr. Yediyurappa got off his car, he had to return as the crowd swelled.

Speaking to reporters later, Mr. Yediyurappa said that he had directed the BBMP officials to find a permanent solution to prevent flooding. He also said that all encroachments would be cleared and that the drive would be taken up soon.

Earlier in the day, he held a meeting with Mr. Ashok, Mr. Gupta and Mr. Prasad on measures taken up by the BBMP in the affected areas.

According to the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre, the highest rainfall of 109.5 mm was recorded at Kengeri.

76,2020/10/24,Two committees to manage Sigandur Chowdeshwari temple,"DC issues order following controversies over administration

Shivamogga Deputy Commissioner K.B.S hivakumar has issued an order constituting two committees to look after Chowdeshwari Temple at Sigandur in Sagar taluk, which hit the headlines recently over differences between the trustees and the priests of the temple.

The DC, in his order issued on Friday, said the monitoring committee would include the Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner of Sagar sub-division, a retired district judge and an auditor. The advisory committee would include the Minister in charge of the district; MLA of Sagar; Lok Sabha member of Shivamogga; Ramappa, trustee of Sigandur Chowdamma Devi Trust; and Sheshagiri Bhat, chief priest of the temple.

The committees have been formed in the wake of recent controversies over the temple administration. Many organisations had appealed to the State government to bring the temple under the Muzrai Department, citing financial mismanagement in the administration. There were allegations that the trust had built many structures encroaching upon the forest area. Recently, the differences between S. Ramappa, the trustee and Sheshagiri Bhat, the priest, had attracted the attention of media.

The DC had visited the temple last week. Chief Minister B.S.Yediyurappa too had held a meeting on the issue during his recent visit to Shivamogga.

The DC, in his order, said the site where Siganduru Chowdeshwari Temple existed was part of Soppina Betta, within the wildlife forest area in the Kargal Range. Siganduru Chowdeshwari Trust had built a temple, lodge, dining hall, toilets, marriage hall, hotel, parking yard and commercial complexes by encroaching upon 20 acres of government land. The tahsildar of Sagar had ordered the demolition of illegal structures on October 30, 2015, itself. The DC also noted irregularities in maintaining the records of valuables offered by the devotees.

Citing these issues, the DC said, he had submitted a report to the State gGovernment. Referring to a High Court order concerning a temple in Chikkamagaluru district, the DC has favoured Muzrai Department taking over the Sigandur temple. He constituted the committee to look after the temple management until the government takes a further decision.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/two-committees-to-manage-sigandur-chowdeshwari-temple/article32936167.ece
77,2020/10/24,"Murder accused shot at, arrested","The Dakshina Kannada district police on Saturday shot at a murder accused, injuring him in the leg, and arrested him. Police gave his name as Khaleel, accused in the murder of Umar Farooq alias Chenna Farooq in Bantwal town police limits on Friday evening.

Farooq was hacked to death allegedly by a gang led by Khaleel at Bogodi Gudde Angadi near Panemangaluru on Friday evening after Farooq’s two-wheeler was hit by a car. Old rivalry was said to be the reason behind the attack. Police immediately barricaded all exit points from the district to apprehend the accused who were said to be planning to flee.

DK Superintendent of Police constituted a special team under Bantwal Circle Inspect of Police and comprising Sub-Inspectors of Police from Bantwal Town, Rural and Uppinangady police stations.

Reportedly upset over a domestic dispute, a man assaulted his father-in-law, mother-in-law and his wife in Hubballi on Saturday, killing his father-in-law on the spot. The incident took place on Saturday morning.

Retired principal of a law college S.S. Mushannavar opened the door of his house to go for his regular morning walk. The accused, Santosh G.S., who reportedly was waiting outside the house, barged into the house and attacked Mushannavar with a knife.

Santosh also attacked his mother-in-law and wife before he was overpowered by others in the house.

Commissioner of Police Labhu Ram, who visited the spot, told presspersons that prima facie it appeared to be the outcome of a marital dispute between husband and wife.

79,2020/10/24,Franklin Templeton cannot wind up six mutual fund schemes without securing unit holders’ consent: HC,"However, it stays operation of the verdict to enable company to approach apex court

The High Court of Karnataka on Saturday said that the Franklin Templeton Trustees Services (FT Trustees) Pvt. Ltd. cannot implement its decision to prematurely wind up six open-ended debt-oriented Mutual Fund (MF) schemes without obtaining the consent of the unit holders in the form of a simple majority.

The consent is mandatory as per 18(15)(a) of the Security Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996, when the majority of the trustees decide to wind up or prematurely redeem the units, the court said while declining to interfere with the FT Trustees’ April 20, 2020 decision to prematurely wind up the schemes.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S .Kinagi delivered the verdict while disposing of the petitions filed by unit holders, who had challenged the decision to close the schemes without following the MF regulations.

However, the Bench stayed the operation of its verdict for six weeks to enable the trustees and the Franklin Templeton Asset Management (FT-AMC) India Pvt. Ltd. to approach the Supreme Court.

No redemption

Meanwhile, the Bench also clarified that there cannot be any redemption by the unit holders during this period of six weeks of stay while also directing the trustees and the FT AMC not to indulge in any borrowing or claim liabilities in relation to these schemes.

The petitions, filed by Amruta Garg in the Delhi High Court and 83-year-old investor Areez Phirozsha Khambatta and his wife in the High Court of Gujarat, were transferred to the High Court of Karnataka in June following a direction from the Supreme Court. A public interest litigation petition filed by M/s Chennai Financial Markets and Accountability in Madras High Court was also heard along with these petitions.

With today’s verdict the process, initiated by the FT Trustees and FT AMC by issuing a notice on May 28 to call a meeting of unit holders to authorise through e-voting the trustees or Deloitte Touche Tohmastsu India LLP to take further steps for winding up of the schemes, cannot be implemented.

61 hours of videoconference hearing

The Bench, while appreciating the cooperation of advocates, who argued from London, New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru through videoconference hearing owing to COVID-19 norms, said that this case has show that any complicated legal matter can be effectively conducted through videoconferencing.

Pointing out that the proceedings in these petitions were heard without any major technical glitches for 61 hours spread over 25 days of court sessions since July and internet connectivity was lost only once, the Bench appreciated the participation of lawyers.

Six schemes

The six schemes to be wound up are: Franklin India Low Duration Fund; Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund; Franklin India Credit Risk Fund; Franklin India Short-Term Income Plan; Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund; and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund.

Holding that the unit holders are entitled to the copies of the resolution of the trustees to wind up the schemes, the Bench directed the trustees to given to the petitioners copies of the resolutions dated April 20 and May 28, which were submitted to the court in sealed cover.

Forensic audit

While stating that petitioners are not entitled to copies of SEBI’s forensic audit/investigation report on six schemes as the audit has not yet reached its final conclusion, the Bench directed the SEBI to examine the question of taking action within six weeks after completion of audit/investigation.

SEBI’s role

The Bench said that the SEBI should have played a very proactive role in such matters though there was no need for the trustees to take prior approval from SEBI for winding up the schemes. The also upheld the constitutional validity of the regulations related to winding up of mutual fund schemes in SEBI’s regulations.

The SEBI had supported the contention of the trustee and FT AMC that 39(2)(a) of the MF Regulations does not prescribe ratification by the unit holders to wind up the schemes.

Also, the SEBI had favoured continuation of the winding up process requesting the court to allow e-voting by unit holders as per the May 28 notice to authorise the trustees or any agency to liquidate assets.

“If the decision to wind up is reversed, the trustees would have to reopen the schemes for transaction and all unit holders would put 100% redemption requests immediately. To meet such redemption requestions, MF would have to sell securities in distress at very deep discount as the whole market is aware of the present distress... Any distress sale of assets of a scheme would reduce NAV (Net Asset Value) which will be detrimental to all the unit holders of the schemes. This in turn would create a wide spread contagion effect across the entire mutual fund industry and harming the interest of all the investors at large,” the SEBI had argued

Petitioners’ contention

It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that the winding up process was illegal as no consent from the unit holders was sought, while alleging that the problem of ‘liquidity stress’ had arisen much prior to impact of COVID-19 and the pandemic situation was used only as an excuse for winding up. The petitioners had also alleged that the SEBI had failed to discharge its duties affectively while challenging the constitutional validity of the regulations related to winding up of mutual funds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/n3jomo/article32823401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10KRAKARHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/franklin-templeton-cannot-wind-up-six-mutual-fund-schemes-without-securing-unit-holders-consent-hc/article32935987.ece

81,2020/10/24,"Soon, RT-PCR test results within 24 hours","Patients in Mysuru had complained of waiting for over a week for test results

A new testing facility is coming up in Mysuru city after Dasara wherein the results of swab test using the RT-PCR method would be available within 24 hours from the time of sample collection. This is expected to reduce complaints from patients over results taking a long time - sometimes even a week.

A lab each at the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) and the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) were carrying out the PCR tests in Mysuru, both handling nearly 1,500 swabs a day.

However, since Mysuru had ramped up tests to over 4,000-5,000 a day, the remaining swabs are sent to labs in Bengaluru for the tests and this was said to be the reason for time taken in getting results. The dispatch time from the two Bengaluru labs on the swabs was around 6 to 9 days, resulting in complaints from the patients.

The issue was taken up with Minister for Health and Medical Education K. Sudhakar recently. The MMCRI will soon be equipped with the new testing system wherein the results are available within 24 hours. And the system can handle as many as 4,000 swabs a day.

Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri in Mysuru on Friday said the government has told the districts to carry out mostly PCR tests and go for Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) only if the results were needed urgently. As the RATs does not discover infection in case of less viral load, 90% of the tests had been shifted to PCR method though the RATs’ results are available within 20 minutes. As of now, only 10% of RATs are being done in the district and maximum tests are being done using the PCR method, she said.

Ms. Sindhuri, in a Facebook live session on Friday, said more beds are now available in government hospitals treating COVID-19 and there was no scarcity of beds with more beds equipped with oxygen supply being added.

As many as 50 beds equipped with centralised oxygen supply were getting ready at the trauma care centre and 50 beds each with oxygen supply in all taluk headquarters were being readied. Patients from taluks can avail treatment from taluk hospitals, she said, and added that the private hospitals had been told to set aside 50% of beds. This was being enforced by teams constituted for this purpose, inspecting the hospitals on a daily basis.

Nearly 24 private hospitals in Mysuru are treating COVID-19 patients and each of them is supposed to display the availability of beds at the reception counter, the DC said, and added that testing, availability of beds, oxygen supply-equipped beds and ventilators had been streamlined.

All parameters are showing improvement in Mysuru with the case fatality rate (CFR) down from 2.1% to 1.5% since over 20 days and the number of tests too have gone up from 2,000 to nearly 4,000 a day.

With regard to the death audit, Ms. Sindhuri said early tests and early treatment are the only remedy to control the toll and advised that the patients should not be under the impression that the infection was more serious in elderly persons and patients with co-morbidities and not among the youth.

She also spoke about patients shifted to private hospitals from government hospitals and advised against such decisions since oxygen levels may drop while shifting, causing complications.

Ms. Sindhuri said the new infections in Mysuru have come down but it is not yet COVID-19-free. There’s only a slight improvement in the situation. People should continue taking all precautions until Mysuru is rid of the disease.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/4cdi76/article32933832.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGMYSURUTESTING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/soon-rt-pcr-test-results-within-24-hours/article32933833.ece

Flowers were showered on the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari seated on a chariot adorned with flowers to kickstart the festivities. Minister in-charge of Mandya district Narayana Gowda, Srirangapatna MLA Ravindra Srikantaiah, Deputy Commissioner M. Venkatesh and others were present during the inauguration.

The procession with the idol was taken out from Kirangur Bannimantap to Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in the town. Usually, the idol placed in a replica of ‘ambari’ is carried on an elephant in the main streets of the town as part of the Dasara procession. The procession was a simple affair this time in view of precautions taken over the pandemic. Only a few cultural troupes were allowed to participate.

After the procession, a cultural programme was organised at Sultan Battery in the town. Singers Raghu Dixit and Kannada music composer Guru Kiran performed.

As the event was organised at the Battery, people from nearby areas watched from their balconies as the entire area was illuminated.

If overcharging was seen, steps would be taken so that the excess amount was returned to the patients, she added.

Ms. Sindhuri, who has already directed all hospitals to set aside 50% of beds for COVID-19 patients, said the private hospitals cannot overprice treatment as the rates had been recommended by the government based on the category and severity of the infection. The rates range from ₹10,000 and ₹25,000 per day and this should not be exceeded at any cost, she said.

85,2020/10/24,"Mysuru Dasara: Virtual audience, tours gain traction","When singer Rajesh Krishnan and his team took to the stage in front of the illuminated Mysuru palace as part of Dasara cultural programmes early this week, there were hardly about 250 people in the audience.

But there were nearly 1.93 lakh people watching the programme aired on different channels and being live-streamed on social media in what was a tribute to legendary singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam who passed away recently.

“This is one of the highest viewership for Mysuru Dasara. Though people were physically not present, they were still a part of the programmes and savoured every bit,” said Raju, Assistant Director, Department of Information and Publicity, and the nodal officer for virtual broadcast of Dasara programmes.

There were viewers from across the globe who enjoyed a slice of Mysuru Dasara virtually, he added.

But virtual viewership is not restricted to Dasara cultural programmes alone. Turning the present crisis plaguing the tourism sector affected by the pandemic into an opportunity, a group of entrepreneurs are presenting a virtual tour showcasing Mysuru to the rest of the world.

The concept of virtual tours is gaining traction among travel addicts across the globe. The virtual tour of Mysuru is an initiative of Gully Tours – earlier known as Royal Mysore Walks – who showcase Old Mysuru with its heritage and culture to the discerning tourists.

Vinay Parameswarappa, founder and CEO, Gully Tours, said it is a unique way of experiencing Dasara in Mysuru and it will be hosted on Zoom where a city expert would take the participants on a fun and interactive journey with live narration with the help of archival photographs, videos and maps. “The Mysuru Dasara Virtual Tour is part of a series of Virtual Tours by Gully Tours. The first was a virtual tour of Mysuru palace which was well received and had participants from India, U.S., U.K. and Australia,” he said.

With the virtual tour, participants get to explore the origins, symbolism and significance of the city’s grand festival right from the comfort of ones house.

COVID-19 hit the tourism sector hard and the Gully Tours was no exception. But it harnessed technology to take advantage of the growing trend of online working, webinars, etc. and decided to offer virtual tours that have already caught on in other parts of the world.

But this experiment will not end with Dasara as Gully Tours has planned a series of simulated trips over the next few weeks including a virtual tour that explores the story of Tipu, Srirangapatna and its global connections, one of Kochi where they will explore its spice trade history and the Jewish community, and one of the IT industry in Bengaluru among others. A portion of the proceeds will go to assist tourist guides who are without income since the ockdown began.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/q0jw3y/article32933805.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGVIRTUALP3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-dasara-virtual-audience-tours-gain-traction/article32933806.ece

87,2020/10/24,‘Re-start meal scheme in schools’,"Child rights activists and students unions have urged the State government to resume mid-day meals for schoolchildren to ensure that they don’t suffer from starvation.

In a letter to the Chief Minister, All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) has sought re-starting the mid-day meal programme in all government schools of the State, that was stopped during the COVID-19 lockdown.

Mid-day meal is a long-term programme that should never be discontinued. It is the only way in which children from poor families get nutritious food. The programme should be resumed immediately, even if schools are reopened later, the letter said. As a result of the lockdown, the State government has not distributed either foodgrains or milk powder to schoolchildren, that were given to them as part of the mid-day meal or Ksheera Bhagya scheme, since June.

“It is a contradiction that while millions of children are starving, foodgrains procured by the government are rotting in public godowns. In Belagavi district, there are over six lakh children who have not got mid-day meal. On the other hand, there are 48 tonnes of rice, 9.1 tonnes of wheat and 5.9 tonnes of other grain in government and public warehouses that have not been distributed. This clearly demonstrates that the government does not care for its people,” said Mahantesh Bilur, district convenor of AIDSO.

Women and Child Welfare Society founder Anjali G. feels that the lockdown was completely unnecessary and had only added to the problems of the poor. India has slipped many places down the global hunger index, lower than several Asian countries. One of the reasons is the unscientific manner in which the lockdown and other COVID-19-related issues were handled.

She said that the lockdown had taken away jobs and livelihoods of many families who were now finding it hard to feed their children. If the government starts the mid-day meal programme, at least such families will get help to a large extent, she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/re-start-meal-scheme-in-schools/article32933600.ece
88,2020/10/24,Kittur Utsav toned down this year,"The three-day festival reduced to a one-day event in view of COVID-19 situation

Celebrations of the Kittur Utsav, the annual feast on the birth anniversary of Rani Channamma, the dowager queen of the British era kingdom of Kittur, was toned down in Kittur on Friday in view of the COVID-19 situation. However, precautions, including social distancing and wearing masks, were not followed during the celebrations.

The three-day festival was reduced to a one-day event this year. The number of artistes to perform along with the rally was reduced to a few and cultural programmes such as songs and dances were not performed on stage.

MLA Mahantesh Dodagoudar, Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath, seers of local mutts and others garlanded the statue of Rani Channamma on the intersection of the Pune-Bengaluru National Highway.

The district administration had invited some descendants of the Kittur Desai family that Rani Channamma belonged to. The officers and guests welcomed the Veer Jyoti lamp that is taken around the district before every Kittur Utsav.

A procession was taken through the main streets of the town. A huge crowd gathered to watch the procession. A large section of the people who gathered did not wear masks nor did they follow social distancing.

At Kakati, the birthplace of Rani Channamma, Police Commissioner K. Thiyagarajan joined Mr. Hiremath in the celebrations.

89,2020/10/24,Some local Congress leaders have exploited my secular credentials: Deve Gowda,"JD(S) national president, who is campaigning for the byelection in Sira Assembly constituency, says he is fighting despite his old age to protect his party

Despite fears of COVID-19, octogenarian former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda has decided to stay and campaign for the byelection in Sira, a constituency with a strong Vokkaliga presence that the Janata Dal (Secular) earlier held. In a telephonic interview from Sira in Tumakuru district, the JD(S) patriarch spoke about his campaign and shared his anger against the Congress, once his party’s ally.

What are the chances of the JD(S) retaining the Sira seat?

This will be a litmus test for us. The party has a base here and we have to give it strength. We will not win with money power. I am personally approaching voters and it is up to them to take a decision based on the party’s work and that of the deceased legislator B. Satyanarayana. The byelection is different and the ruling party is going to exploit power.

What brought you to the electoral arena, considering your age and the COVID-19 pandemic?

People who grew in the JD(S) and migrated are now talking of the party “disappearing” after this election. That is why I have taken this election seriously. I am fighting despite my old age to protect the party. The party is certainly going to survive. I am not bothered what Congress leaders say. I will stay here and campaign till November 1.

Do you think it was a mistake for the JD(S) to have allied with the Congress in 2018 to form the coalition government?

Yes. I did not want H.D. Kumaraswamy to head the government and had instead suggested senior Congress leader M. Mallikarjun Kharge’s name. We were forced by the Congress high command to head the secular government. Local leaders were not consulted. The former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and the former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar were responsible for bringing down the government. That is the blunder I have committed. I have learnt a lesson.

Your son and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy in a recent interview said that your ‘secular weakness’ has been exploited by the Congress. Do you agree?

Certainly. Some Congress local leaders have exploited my secular credentials throughout my political career. I have stood by secular politics and I did not compromise even when the NDA parties, including the BJP, offered to support me when I was stepping down as the Prime Minister. Even now, Congress leaders publicly state that there will be no JD(S) after this election. I am striving to revive the party that has been damaged for agreeing to form a secular coalition in Karnataka.

But you were elected to the Rajya Sabha recently with the help of the Congress.

Some local leaders have other plans. It was because of Mr. Kharge and K.C. Venugopal that Congress chief Sonia Gandhi decided to not field another candidate, paving the way for my entry to the Rajya Sabha. Problem is with local leaders.

Why is the Congress aggressively attacking the JD(S) now?

KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar attempted to destabilise the JD(S) in the past by persuading Mr. Siddaramaiah to go out of the party. The former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna and Mr. Shivakumar have attempted to destabilise the late N. Dharam Singh-led coalition government. Today, Congress leaders are doing the same thing to destabilise the party.

How do you intend to bring secular forces together from now on?

First, my age and health have to permit. I do not know what role I will play in the remaining time. This country should not suffer on account of fundamentalist forces. There should be protection to minorities, Dalits, and all other sections. This country belongs to all. Democracy is deep rooted and one-party rule cannot happen. I will make known by future plans after November 10.

Will the JD(S) have any role in the current political speculation over change of guard in the BJP government?

I have nothing to do with it. When B.S. Yeddyurappa took oath, we openly declared we are not going to destabilise his government. I do not want to offer any comment on the speculation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/zct76s/article32933370.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGDEVEGOWDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/some-local-congress-leaders-have-exploited-my-secular-credentials-deve-gowda/article32933371.ece

Other priority groups and populations will be covered in a phased manner, stated a note from the Department of Health and Family Welfare.

Karnataka has started work on preparing a database of healthcare workers and the State’s task force that met on October 13 discussed the COVID-19 vaccine introduction and preparedness. The existing cold chain system of routine immunisation under the Universal Immunisation Programme will be utilised for vaccine introduction when it becomes available. The cold chain preparedness and strengthening assessment is being done, stated the note.

Following directions from the Union Ministry to complete preliminary data collection by October 31, a State-level orientation was held on October 20 for all Deputy Commissioners, District Health Officers, and reproductive child health officers.

“District-level orientation for government and private health facilities has also started. Standard templates for collection of details of healthcare workers are being shared with all healthcare facilities. All health facilities registered under the Karnataka Private Medical Establishments Act are being informed through online portals and SMS for timely data collection. Professional bodies of doctors are being roped in for this,” the note said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/healthcare-workers-to-benefit-first-from-covid-19-vaccine/article32933318.ece
91,2020/10/24,Karnataka Health Department permits pooled sample testing,"To optimise RT-PCR testing, the Health Department has issued a circular directing health authorities in both government and private sectors to pool COVID-19 samples (with a sample size of five per pool) and test them. Based on the result of the sample pool, further action should be taken (i.e. if positive, individual samples should be tested while if negative, all will be deemed negative).

This is in the wake of the test positivity rate (TPR) in the State dropping from 14% to 7%. Currently, samples are being tested individually through RT-PCR.

“It should be noted that the pooling of samples for diagnostic purposes is permitted only in taluks which report a test positivity rate of below 5%. And pooling is not recommended in taluks reporting a test positivity rate above 5%. In Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) areas, zones shall be taken as a unit. If the TPR of the zone is less than 5%, then pooling should be done. The total number of RT-PCR tests assigned to the districts remains unchanged,” the circular said.

“For arriving at a TPR, the time period of the last seven days shall be taken. The Deputy Commissioners/Special Commissioner, BBMP, should notify the taluks/zones for pooled testing every Monday based on last one week’s positivity report,” the circular stated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-health-department-permits-pooled-sample-testing/article32933316.ece
92,2020/10/24,COVID-19: Karnataka sees a huge surge in RT-PCR testing,"More than 30% of the tests have been conducted in Bengaluru Urban and Kalaburagi districts

The State’s dependence on Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) has reduced considerably with over 64% of the total 71,68,545 tests conducted till date being molecular (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, or RT-PCR). RT-PCR testing is the gold standard that has negligible chances of false negativity.

While over 30% of these have been conducted in Bengaluru Urban and Kalaburagi alone, Dakshina Kannada and Mysuru have contributed to nearly 4%. Kodagu has done the least number of RT-PCR tests, with its share being not more than 0.5 %.

With testing ramped up aggressively in Bengaluru Urban, the spread of the virus is slowing down here. However, the other districts are seeing a surge and the days taken to double COVID-19 cases in at least 13 districts is lower than the State average of 46 days.

Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, told The Hindu that the State had set a target of conducting 80% of the total tests through the RT-PCR method, and on a day-on-day basis the target had been met in the past few days. “Although we have ramped up RT-PCR, we will continue testing using RAT as it is the most useful point-of-care test, especially in the identification and treatment of SARI and ILI cases. Our strategy of increasing tests even as the cases were surging has helped in containing the spread,” he said.

“Till a few days ago, we were conducting about 80% RAT and 20% RT-PCR tests. We have reversed this now and have overtaken Tamil Nadu in the number of RT-PCR tests,” he said.

Testing strategy

Giridhara R. Babu, member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said, “The overall testing strategy is more important than the numbers.” He added that districts should be reviewed on two criteria. “Finding people by syndromic approach and testing people with symptoms is the first thing. Next, it is important to assess what is the proportion of symptomatic people who tested negative on RAT and who were then tested using RT-PCR. Many districts are going through a surge in cases. Therefore, testing levels have to be increased, depending on the stage of outbreak in the districts,” he said.

V. Ravi, senior professor and head of the Department of Neuro Virology at NIMHANS, who is part of the State’s COVID-19 expert committee, said Karnataka has been able to bring down the number of new cases and daily test positivity rate only after ramping up RT-PCR tests. “An increase in RT-PCR tests has helped in tracking, testing and identifying positive people and isolating them, reducing false negativity,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/85wsbo/article32935029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23bgbgyasRT-PGDN7T3PDV3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-karnataka-sees-a-huge-surge-in-rt-pcr-testing/article32933303.ece
93,2020/10/24,COVID-19: Karnataka’s daily test positivity rate falls below 5%,"Karnataka on Friday reported 5,356 new COVID-19 cases, taking the total number of cases to 7,93,907. With this, the State’s daily test positivity rate (TPR) reduced to 4.94%, which is a good indication. However, the cumulative TPR stood at 11.07%.

TPR, which is a vital marker in assessing the spread of an outbreak, is the percentage of people found to be infected by the virus from among those being tested. While the cumulative positivity rate takes into account all the people tested so far, the daily rate is based on those tested on a particular day.

According to epidemiologists, a high positivity rate indicates that testing is relatively limited to people with high suspicion of COVID-19 and may miss new chains of transmission in the community. The World Health Organisation recommends that the daily positivity rate should be below 5% for at least two weeks before public health measures are relaxed.

Meanwhile, the State reported 51 new deaths, taking the toll to 10,821. This is apart from 19 deaths of COVID-19 patients due to other reasons. The State’s case fatality rate (CFR) touched 0.95% on Friday.

As many as 8,749 persons were discharged on Friday, taking the total number of recoveries to 69,35,584. Of the 89,483 active cases, 936 patients were being monitored in the ICU.

95,2020/10/24,"Set up dedicated team to enforce COVID-19 norms in Bengaluru, says HC","The High Court of Karnataka on Friday directed the State government to set up a dedicated team of officials for Bengaluru city to strictly enforce the norm of compulsory wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing in public places.

The court also directed the government to impose an additional condition of compulsorily wearing of mask/covering the mouth and nose with a cloth and maintaining social distancing while granting permission for holding rallies, processions and demonstrations under the Licensing and Controlling of Assemblies and Processions (Bangalore City) Order, 2008.

It said a dedicated team was essential as it was impossible for the mere 198 marshals of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), whose main task is to prevent people from throwing garbage in public places, to enforce COVID-19 regulations in a city with a population of around 1.3 crore.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi issued the directions which was hearing a PIL petition filed by Letzkit Foundation. It also noted that the participants of various rallies and demonstrations were contributing to the norm violations.

Directing the government to set up the dedicated team before October 28, the Bench said the government must entrust a specific area to a specific member of the team.

Whenever permissions are granted for rallies and more under the licensing order of 2008, the government should deploy certain police personnel with the task of ensuring that the participants strictly adhere to the norms, said the Bench.

The Bench also noted that public servants such as sub-inspectors of police, assistant sub-inspectors of police, head constables, panchayat development officers, gram panchayat secretaries, and municipal bill collectors were among those authorised by the law to collect spot fines from people not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/set-up-dedicated-team-to-enforce-covid-19-norms-in-bengaluru-says-hc/article32933267.ece

The High Court of Karnataka on Friday gave the liberty to the State Election Commission (SEC) to take a decision as per law on holding elections to around 5,800 gram panchayats (GPs) even though the court has reserved orders on a public interest litigation (PIL) petition which sought directions for holding the elections without further delay.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi made these observations in the order while reserving the verdict on the petition, filed by K.C. Kondaiah, a Congress MLC, and four others.

Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi told the Bench that there is a need to postpone elections to gram panchayats considering the increase in the number of COVID-19 positive cases and the SEC should take the government into confidence in view of the pandemic as the health of citizens is the priority at present.

However, the SEC said it had a series of discussions with all the district administrations and the police on holding the elections, after the conclusion of the byelections to the State Assembly, in a phased manner by ensuring health safety of citizens and the public servants on election duty.

During the hearing, the Bench said the elections can be held in districts where the number of COVID-19 cases is less while reminding the conduct of SSLC exams, when the A-G said it was difficult to enforce COVID-19 norms during election campaign at village levels. “We can control students but not politicians,” the A-G replied while showing a photograph of how COVID-19 norms were violated during election campaign in Bihar.

97,2020/10/24,"BJP, Congress oppose the Kerala government's move to withdraw general consent to CBI","If implemented, Kerala will join a line-up of non-Bharathiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled States to ban the central agency from functioning in their respective jurisdiction without the explicit consent of the provincial government

A purported move by the Kerala government to withdraw the general consent given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to operate in its territory appeared to have become an irritant in the State's arguably fraught relationship with the Centre.

If implemented, Kerala will join a line-up of non-Bharathiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled States to ban the central agency from functioning in their respective jurisdiction without the explicit consent of the provincial government. The States include West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and, soon, Maharashtra.

BJP decries move

Union Minister of State for External Affairs, V. Muralidharan on Saturday decried the government's reported plan to the ban the CBI.

The State government wanted to fend off the CBI to cover up high-level corruption and save top leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) from being investigated for recurrent political murders in North Kerala, he said.

The Pinarayi Vijayan government had brazenly recruited top lawyers from New Delhi to prevent the CBI from investigating Life Mission, a State-agency involved in providing free housing for the poor, on the charge of violating the Foreign. Contribution (Regulation) Act. The CPI-M also feared that overlapping investigations by central law enforcement agencies into the UAE gold smuggling case and narcotic busts in Karnataka would reach the doorstep of its leadership, he added.

CPI(M) fears exposure: UDF

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the Congress-led United Democratic Front (LDF) would oppose the move to ban the CBI. He said the LDF wanted to conceal its corruption and other high crimes, including playing second fiddle to gold smugglers treasonously.

CPI defends move

State secretary of the Communist Party of India (CPI) Kanam Rajendran said Mr Muralidharan seemed to imply that the BJP owned the CBI. He said the Central government had without compunction used the CBI to destabilise non-BJP ruled States, and Kerala was no exception.

The Left Democratic Front (LDF) was aware of the plot to use the central law enforcement to discredit the government in the election year.

The CPI had on October 23 requested the LDF to recommend to the government to withdraw the free rein accorded to the CBI under the provisions of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act. The law clearly states that law and order and crime investigation are State subjects.

CPI(M) backs proposal

The CPI(M) had on Friday formally requested the government to explore legal options to curb the CBI from acting on its own volition in Kerala.

The CBI could probe local cases or charge-sheet suspects only with the permission of the State administration.

The agency cannot act on its own accord even in cases involving scheduled offences. The CBI does not require the consent of the State government only in investigations ordered by the Supreme Court of the High Court, the party felt.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/n9fqpj/article32808488.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08-KDR-SC-LavG8F7RC17D3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bjp-congress-oppose-the-kerala-governments-move-to-withdraw-general-consent-to-cbi/article32936085.ece

Inaugurating the campus, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan complimented the premier technical institute for proactively addressing the needs of the region. A permanent campus in 500 acres, being set up adjoining the Nila campus, would go a long way in promoting education and pushing societal advancements.

Union Minister for Education Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank laid the foundation stone for the main campus, the work on which has already begun. He said the IIT, Palakkad, made rapid progress since its opening in 2015. The IIT has 640 undergraduate students, 225 postgraduate students, and 132 doctoral scholars. He praised their role in building a “new India”.

100,2020/10/24,Kerala gold smuggling case: HC stays Sivasankar’s arrest till Oct. 28,"It will pronounce its judgment that day on his bail plea in UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case

The Kerala High Court has stayed the arrest of M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, till October 28 in the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case. The court will pronounce its judgment that day on his bail application.

Appearing for the Enforcement Directorate (ED), S.V. Raju, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) of India, submitted that Mr. Sivasankar could be the kingpin of the entire smuggling activities and may have used Swapna Suresh as a pawn in the operations. Swapna was just the face of the operations and Mr. Sivasankar could have been pulling the strings. The agency was probing these aspects, he said.

Mr. Sivasankar may have had a direct role and involvement in the operations, Mr. Raju argued while opposing the bail application.

ASG’s submission

According to the ASG, Swapna was under Mr. Sivasankar’s control and he could have benefited from the smuggling operations that were carried out 21 times. Mr. Sivasankar, being one of the senior-most bureaucrats of the State and the Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, may well have intervened to clear obstacles in the way of the smuggling racket.

It was likely that smuggling was carried out more times than the accused had cared to admit, he said.

The ASG submitted that Mr. Sivasankar was well aware that the money recovered from Swapna’s locker was proceeds of the crime.

‘Little evidence’

P. Vijayabhanu, counsel for Mr. Sivasankar, said he had always cooperated with the investigation and there was nothing on record to prove the allegations levelled against him by the agencies. While the Customs had questioned Mr. Sivasankar for 30 hours, the ED interrogated him for 36 hours. The National Investigation Agency had earlier submitted that they did not have any plans to arrest him, he argued.

The counsel also submitted that Mr. Sivasankar was being hounded and he was finding it difficult to even rent a hotel room.

101,2020/10/24,KSRTC to take a call on infra for e-buses,"Shift from diesel to CNG and electric buses to cut operational costs

With a gradual shift from diesel to CNG and electric buses mooted to rein in operational costs to turnaround the loss-making utility, the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation is expected to take a call soon on establishing infrastructure, including charging points at its depots.

Emphasis will also have to be given to preventive maintenance of buses and pacts with startups and other firms for annual maintenance contract, to lessen life-cycle cost.

The KSRTC, which has charging stations at an average distance of 100 km, will have to increase the number of charging stations, even as it begins generating electricity by installing rooftop solar power plants at bus depots, official sources said.

Creating a dedicated special purpose vehicle with the Kerala State Electricity Board and ANERT to operate electric buses and collaborating with KSRTC’s SCT College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram, in areas such as data analytics, trip scheduling, and fleet maintenance will pay dividends.

e-buses will have considerably low wear and tear since they have negligible number of moving parts vis a vis diesel buses, further decreasing operational cost. It goes without saying that e-buses do not cause air and sound pollution either, they added.

Experts have suggested introducing buses with minimum number of batteries to operate within cities or between neighbouring districts as it will reduce capital expenses on buses, with the cost of batteries constituting about 40% of the cost of a bus, it is learnt.

A few stakeholders having expertise in e-mobility are in discussions with the KSRTC to convert diesel buses to e-buses, rein in operational expenses, and lessen the carbon footprint of bus operations. “Already, the KSRTC has begun making optimal use of its old buses by converting them into restrooms for its crew and as a low-cost accommodation option for tourists visiting locales such as Munnar. Buses in good condition can be converted to e-buses, in a phased manner, for sustainable and long-term gains,” said Sibi Mathai, MD of a firm which maintains the Volvo fleet of the KSRTC and a few other RTCs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ksrtc-to-take-a-call-on-infra-for-e-buses/article32933275.ece

Wedding saris would be woven at the silk weaving unit. Sarees would also be made according to the customers’ orders utilising the 10 looms in the centre. The foundation stone for a marketing complex being set up at a cost of ₹50 crore was also laid on the occasion.

Mr. Jayarajan said that the Kerala Khadi Village Industries Board was working hard to ensure job security for khadi workers in Kerala, make more productive the khadi movement, which was begun by Mahatma Gandhi as part of the national movement, and to play an important role in the overall growth of the country.

For the past four and a half years, the khadi sector had been on a path of recovery. During the period, 26 khadi production centres were started and 3,384 jobs created. Steps were being taken to create 5,000 more jobs, the Minister said.

He said that khadi products needed to be diversified. People were of the opinion that only the elderly and politicians wore khadi clothes. Hence, the need to diversify and increase production and marketing, he said.

Measures were being taken to produce muslin in Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, and Thrissur and to reduce the workload of the workers by using sophisticated power looms. This would also lead to increased production. The government had sanctioned ₹125 crore for paying the minimum wage in the khadi sector and ₹23.3 crore for production incentive.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rprmdt/article24656828.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EPJAYARAJAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-striving-to-create-jobs-in-khadi-sector-minister/article32933274.ece

Filmmaker David Fincher has confirmed that there won’t be any further seasons of his critically-acclaimed series “Mindhunter.”

The Netflix show follows a special team within the FBI, spearheaded by Agents Bill Tench ( Holt McCallany) and Holden Ford ( Jonathan Groff), that investigates what makes serial killers tick during the ‘70s.

The first season premiered in October 2017 and the show was formally renewed for its sophomore outing, which debuted in August 2019.

However, since then, the streamer and the director haven’t announced a third season. Earlier this year, Groff, McCallany and Anna Torv were released from their contracts due to uncertainty over the show’s future.

In an interview with Vulture, Fincher said he is “probably” done with show as it was a costly endeavour for him.

“I think probably. Listen, for the viewership that it had, it was an expensive show. We talked about ‘Finish ‘Mank’ and then see how you feel,’ but I honestly don’t think we’re going to be able to do it for less than I did season two. And on some level, you have to be realistic about dollars have to equal eyeballs,” the filmmaker said.

Fincher further said that the show was a “lot for me” as he spent six to seven months a year for over three years in Pittsburgh in order to work on the series.

“We had done the first season of ‘Mindhunter’ without a showrunner, with me pinch-hitting on a week-by-week basis. We started getting scripts for the second season, and I ended up looking at what was written and deciding I didn’t like any of it. So we tossed it and started over.

“I brought in Courtenay Miles, an AD I’d worked with who wanted to write, and she ended up co-showrunning ‘Mindhunter.’ But it’s a 90-hour work week. It absorbs everything in your life. When I got done, I was pretty exhausted, and I said, ‘I don’t know if I have it in me right now to break season three’,” the director said.

Fincher’s upcoming movie is “Mank”, based on the life of “Citizen Kane” screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz. The movie will be released on Netflix on December 4.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fho38r/article32936465.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mind,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/no-more-mindhunter-on-netflix-confirms-david-fincher/article32936466.ece

107,2020/10/24,‘Borat Subsequent Moviefilm’ review: Sacha Baron Cohen’s back to raise hell,"Despite a variety of relevant topics all commented upon, the sequel does not feel as sharp and fresh as the original

He is back, and this time with his daughter.

Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen), the reporter from Kazakhstan, who in Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006), came to study American culture and ended up making his country a laughing stock around the world. Borat was thrown into prison for this and has spent the last 14 years breaking rocks.

Now, he is given a chance to make things right when the President (Dani Popescu) suggests he go once again to America and present a monkey (the minister of culture no less) to President McDonald Trump. Borat’s producer, Azamat Bagatov, unfortunately does not accompany him as he has been turned into a dreadfully detailed armchair.

Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan Director: Jason Woliner

Cast: Sacha Baron Cohen, Maria Bakalova, Dani Popescu

Storyline: The intrepid reporter from glorious nation of Kazakhstan returns to US and A for more cultural learnings

Run time: 96 minutes

Of course, nothing goes as planned with Borat and instead of a monkey he is stuck with his daughter, Tutar (Maria Bakalova). Borat tries to make good by offering his daughter instead and all matter of mayhem ensues only to come right in the end.

COVID-19, the US elections, racism, feminism and anti-Semitism are all commented upon apart from the ubiquitous smartphones and Internet searches. Borat appears in a variety of disguises, including a pink bikini in that much publicised encounter with former Mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani. There is the weird accent and strange syntax as well the political incorrectness, but it all feels a little bit bleh—not as sharp and fresh as the original. One could have done with some irreverent laughs in these endless rainy days. Sigh.

108,2020/10/24,Donald Trump calls ‘Borat’ star an unfunny ‘creep’,"Sacha Baron Cohen’s new film shows Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in a compromising position in a hotel room with a young woman acting as a journalist

President Donald Trump says he thinks Sacha Baron Cohen, the comedian behind the Borat films, is a creep. Baron Cohen’s new movie, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, shows Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in a compromising position in a hotel room with a young woman acting as a journalist.

Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday night that he didn’t know what happened with Giuliani.

“But, you know, years ago he tried to scam me,” Trump said of Baron Cohen. “And I was the only one that said, ‘No way. This guy is a phony guy.’ I don’t find him funny,” Trump said, adding, “To me, he’s a creep.”

Trump appeared briefly on HBO’s Da Ali G Show in 2003, but walked away from an interview with Baron Cohen’s Ali G character after just a minute.

One scene in Baron Cohen’s new movie scene shows Giuliani on a bed, tucking in his shirt with his hand down his pants after the woman helps him remove recording equipment. Giuliani called the scene a hit job and said he realized he was being set up.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/i4rbr4/article32935615.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020TRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/donald-trump-calls-borat-star-an-unfunny-creep/article32935616.ece

110,2020/10/24,"Opposition role is to play politics and not to remain silent, says Stalin","Stalin said if the Chief Minister was keen to prove his efficiency, he should get the Governor’s assent for the Bill.

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday said if his party’s efforts to get 7.5% reservation for NEET-qualified state government school students in medical college admission was seen as a political game, it would wholeheartedly accept the charge of politicisation.

Addressing a demonstration organised by the DMK to press Governor Banwarilal Purohit to grant assent to the Bill seeking to implement 7.5% reservation, Mr. Stalin said Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami might accuse the DMK of playing politics as he was not able to understand the issue.

“The opposition would play politics (arasiyal) and not prepare aviyal (dish),” he quipped.

Reiterating that the DMK would not rest till the Governor gave his nod to the bill, he said Mr Palaniswami “who crawled to get the Chief Minister post” could plead with the Governor to get the consent.

“We do not expect the Chief Minister to crawl before the Governor. What is the justification for occupying the Chief Minister’s seat when you are not able to request the Governor to get his assent,” Mr. Stalin said.

In a statement later, he said if the Chief Minister was keen to prove his efficiency, he should get the Governor’s assent for the Bill.

Pointing out that already 40 days had passed since the Bill was sent to the Governor for assent, Mr Stalin wondered what was the need for the Governor to take into account the legal aspects since the reservation was recommended by a retired judge Justice Kalaiyarasan.

“If the bill gets the assent around 300 government school students could get entry into medical colleges. Otherwise only eight of them can get seats. How can we remain silent in the face such a grave injustice,” he asked.

Mr. Stalin said the Governor would be under the impression that his delay would result in the AIADMK government giving up the bill. “But the DMK would not sit idle. We will adopt all the ways and means to make the Governor to give his nod to the bill,” he stressed.

He wanted to know what was the need for the Governor to delay his assent since he had travelled the state and earned a name for his active approach. “Probably he would have thought that the AIADMK government would not question him. But the DMK will question him,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/42hcir/article32936147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/opposition-role-is-to-play-politics-and-not-to-remain-silent-says-stalin/article32936148.ece

113,2020/10/24,Retired DGP moves HC seeking advance bail,"Actor had accused him of cheating

Retired Director General of Police W. Ramesh Kudawala, 61, has approached the Madras High Court, seeking anticipatory bail in a case booked against him and others for allegedly cheating film actor Soori in the purchase of an immovable property at Siruseri for ₹5.76 crore.

The petitioner apprehended that the police might arrest and “compel” him to admit to the offence, though he had nothing to do with the transaction. He also said that the reported transaction was civil in nature and would not attract any penal provision under criminal law.

The former police officer said his son Vishnu Vishal was a film actor, managing his professional and financial activities on his own. The petitioner also asserted that he had never interfered in the professional activities of his son.

Mr. Soori, in a police complaint, claimed that the petitioner had approached him for playing a comic role in a movie, titled Veera Theera Suran, in which his son was to play the lead role. He further claimed that his remuneration was fixed at ₹40 lakh.

Though the movie was to be originally produced by V.R. Anbuvel Rajan of AVR Productions, it was later decided that it would be produced under the banner of Vishnu Vishal Productions. It was also stated in the complaint that the movie was renamed as Kadhanayagan.

According to the actor, he was not paid any remuneration for 32 additional days of shooting that took place after a change in the production house. In the meantime, Mr. Kudawala reportedly enticed the actor to invest in real estate.

Landlocked property

Claiming that he had purchased the property through Mr. Rajan, in the belief that the latter was Mr. Kudawala’s business associate, Mr. Soori stated that only after the purchase did he come to know that the property was landlocked and had no approach road.

After extracting contents of the complaint in his advance bail petition, the retired DGP claimed he had no connection, whatsoever, with the alleged transaction.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/retired-dgp-moves-hc-seeking-advance-bail/article32933725.ece

115,2020/10/24,High Court refuses to quash 35-year-old case,"It deals with a murder attempt

The Madras High Court has paved the way for the commencement of trial in a 35-year-old case, booked for an alleged attempt to murder Anton Balasingam, a close confidante of LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran, at his residence in Besant Nagar, Chennai, in 1985.

Justice P.N. Prakash refused to quash the case just because Balasingham was no more, just one accused was available for trial and most records were not available with the court due to the passage of time and the transfer of the case from one court to another.

The judge agreed with Government Advocate (criminal side) P. Kritika Kamal that though Balasingham was no more, other witnesses were available to testify. Further, case records had been reconstructed and trial could proceed, he said.

Though some accused were absconding and one person had died, the judge ordered that the trial could commence against the available accused, Veerasangili Kanniah Thanabalan alias V.K.T. Balan, who had moved the High Court to quash the case on the ground of long delay.

Relying on a couple of Supreme Court verdicts, wherein it had been held that delay could not be a sole ground to quash a case, the judge said in the present case, the allegations against the accused were indeed very serious as a bomb had exploded in Balasingham's residence but luckily, no one was injured.

Further, the accused had also been charged with passing on official secrets regarding the country. Therefore, a delay or loss of records could not be cited as reasons for quashing the case, the judge said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-refuses-to-quash-35-year-old-case/article32933712.ece

117,2020/10/24,HR&CE Department will give impetus to temple land identification exercise,"Commissioner is upset at the lack of major progress in the last two years

The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department has decided to give an impetus to a court-initiated exercise that commenced in February 2018 for identifying immovable properties owned by every temple under its control, ascertaining the extent of properties alienated illegally so far, the lands that were under encroachment and those for which paltry amounts were being paid as rent or lease.

HR&CE Commissioner S. Prabhakar has expressed disappointment over the lack of any major progress in the last two years and summoned all district-level Assistant Commissioners to his office for submission of the details, along with statistics. In a communication to regional and district officials, he deplored the practice of officials providing contradictory statistics to the Department.

The communication recalled that Justice R. Mahadevan of the Madras High Court had, on February 12, 2018, directed the Department to form individual committees to identify all temple land and free them of encroachment and illegal occupation within six weeks.

The judge also ordered that the property details of every temple be hosted on the Department’s website, and action be initiated against officials who had failed to protect the lands.

Committees formed

Immediately thereafter, the Department ordered constitution of property identification committees in every temple.

District-level review committees, comprising the Assistant Commissioners, were also formed. The committees were directed to submit their monthly reports in an appropriate format to the HR&CE Commissioner. However, when their performance was reviewed recently, it was found to be unsatisfactory.

The review revealed that only 90% of the temples had constituted the property identification committees so far and even those committees had completed only 25% of the work. Further, just 10% of the temples had submitted their final reports. Expressing displeasure over contradictory reports filed by some officials, the HR&CE Commissioner said such an act does not bode well for the administration of the Department.

T.R. Ramesh of the Indic Collective Trust, which had filed several cases in the High Court for protecting temple properties, alleged that the HR&CE Commissioner began to crack the whip only after a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha recently warned that he would have to appear in person before the court if no proper progress was shown on the issue of alienation of lands.

He said the Department was expected to report progress to the Division Bench on December 1 when the Division Bench would hear the issue once again.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hrce-department-will-give-impetus-to-temple-land-identification-exercise/article32933628.ece

After nearly six years, Nokia’s defunct plant at Sriperumbudur, which was acquired by Salcomp, commenced production as Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami inaugurated it on Friday.

Mr. Palaniswami inaugurated seven projects worth ₹1,298.2 crore with the potential to generate as many as 7,879 jobs.

Of the seven projects that went live, the memoranda of understanding for six were inked at the second edition of the Global Investors’ Meet that was held at the Chennai Trade Centre in January 2019.

“We have commenced production, and the plant will reach full capacity by the end of 2022,” Sasikumar Gendham, managing director of Salcomp India, told The Hindu. According to him, two lines were activated for production, while another six would go live by the year-end. “The plan is to make 50 million pieces of chargers and components that go into mobiles/chargers by the end of 2021,” he said.

Nokia’s Chennai plant downed shutters in 2014 following a tax dispute. When Microsoft acquired Nokia’s handset business, the Chennai plant was excluded from the deal. The tax issues were settled in 2018 and the plant was put up for sale. It was acquired by Salcomp in 2019.

120,2020/10/24,"Give assent to the Bill or leave, CPI(M) tells Governor","Purohit’s response raises doubts: Ramakrishnan

The CPI(M) State unit on Friday urged Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit to immediately give assent to the legislation passed in the Assembly for providing 7.5% horizontal reservation to NEET-qualified government school students or else move out of Tamil Nadu.

In a statement, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member G. Ramakrishnan referred to the Governor’s response to DMK president M.K. Stalin that it will take at least three to four weeks for him to decide on the Bill.

“His response raises doubts. What other important work he has got during that period? Did the Governor point that out to the Ministers who met him? Why did the Ministers not disclose it?” he asked.

Mr. Ramakrishnan also said the delay in decision raises suspicion that the Governor is helping in adopting policies of the BJP government and it cannot be allowed.

Alagiri’s warning

Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri on Friday warned of severe consequences if the Governor kept delaying the decision on giving assent to the Bill.

In a statement, he pointed out the Governor could not act against the recommendation of the State Cabinet, and strongly condemned the delay in decision-making.

Mr. Alagiri also slammed the ruling AIADMK government and alleged they had not put adequate pressure on the Governor over the issue.

He further alleged that Governors in States like West Bengal and Maharashtra, among others, were acting like agents of the BJP government at the Centre, and the Tamil Nadu Governor was also adopting the same approach.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/give-assent-to-the-bill-or-leave-cpim-tells-governor/article32933761.ece

The government will persist in its attempts at getting the Governor’s assent for the Bill providing 7.5% horizontal reservation to NEET-qualified State government students in medical admissions, Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said on Friday. He added that the government was confident that Governor Banwarilal Purohit will give his assent to the Bill.

Speaking to reporters in Chennai, Mr. Jayakumar said counselling for MBBS/BDS would be held only after the Governor gives his assent. “We have 100% confidence in the Governor. He will definitely give his approval to the Bill. Only when the horizontal quota of 7.5% is fulfilled will counselling be held. We are clear on that,” he said.

122,2020/10/24,"Stalin shedding crocodile tears, says CM Palaniswami","‘DMK leader is trying to gain political mileage out of quota’

DMK president M.K. Stalin is shedding crocodile tears on the issue of the 7.5% horizontal reservation in medical education and is trying to gain political mileage, but the people will see through his designs, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Friday.

No right

“The DMK and the Congress, which were responsible for the introduction of the NEET, have no right to say the AIADMK government has not mounted enough pressure on the Governor on the horizontal reservation issue. It is the AIADMK government that has created 3,050 new medical seats in the last nine years,” Mr. Palaniswami said in a statement.

The AIADMK government got a Bill on the horizontal quota passed in the Assembly to give an opportunity to students of government schools on a par with those of private schools.

“Hence, people will see through the Leader of the Opposition shedding crocodile tears...,” he said.

Mr. Palaniswami said that to gain political mileage, Mr. Stalin wanted to create an impression that it was because of the DMK’s efforts that the Governor was looking into the Bill.

‘Virus spread contained’

He said the government had successfully contained the spread of COVID-19 and keeping in mind the welfare of the people, he had announced that a vaccine, when available, would be given free of cost.

“Mr. Stalin is afraid that the AIADMK government is finding favour with people and following my announcement on the vaccine, he is again indulging in ‘press release politics’. People will not be fooled by this,” he said.

Baseless: Stalin

Mr. Stalin on Friday charged Mr. Palaniswami with making baseless statements about NEET and said the exams began to be conducted in Tamil Nadu only after he took charge. “Mr. Palaniswami has no right to speak about competence in his statement. If he wants to prove his competence and worth to the people, he should get the Governor’s approval immediately for the horizontal reservation of 7.5% in medical admissions,” he said.

Joining issue with the Chief Minister, Mr. Stalin said he had written to the Governor on the issue only with the good intention that he would take a swifter decision if both the ruling party and the opposition jointly raised the issue.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stalin-shedding-crocodile-tears-says-on-horizontal-quota-sayscm-palaniswami/article32933732.ece
123,2020/10/24,Five women charred to death in fireworks unit accident,"Three critically injured employees have been admitted to Madurai hospital

Five women workers were charred to death and three employees, including a man, suffered critical burns in a fire accident at Rajalakshmi Fireworks under the T. Kallupatti police station limits in Madurai district on Friday.

The police have identified the victims as M. Veluthai, 45, of S. Paraipatti; P. Lakshmi, 50, of Kilarpatti; P. Suruliammal, 50, of Govindanallur in Virudhunagar district; K. Ayyammal, 65, of Kadaneri; and S. Kaleeswari, 45, of Athipatti.

R. Sundaramoorthy, 39, of Amathur, P. Lakshmi, 45, and M. Mahalakshmi, 45, from Kadaneri sustained more than 70% burns. They were admitted to the Government Rajaji Hospital in a critical condition, the police said.

Fire and Rescue Services personnel from Madurai and Virudhunagar districts, led by Deputy Director (Southern region) P. Saravanakumar, rushed to the spot and put out the fire that had spread from the chemical mixing room to two working sheds.

High temperature

Officials suspect that mixing of chemicals under high atmospheric temperature on a hot afternoon could have triggered an explosion in the mixing room around 2 p.m.

“A blast in the chemical mixing room is suspected to have caused the fire,” Madurai Collector T.G. Vinay said. The unit had a licence valid till March 2021. The number of employees working in the unit was within the permitted limit. “An inspection by explosives experts will reveal the actual cause and whether there was any violation of safety rules,” he said.

After the explosion in the mixing room, flames spread to two working sheds where the women were working. They were caught in a ball of fire, said Madurai District Fire Officer S. Kalyanakumar.

Firemen with three fire tenders from T. Kallupatti, Virudhunagar and Watrap struggled for nearly an hour to put out the flames. Superintendent of Police Sujit Kumar rushed to the spot.

The Collector visited the hospital and instructed the Dean to provide high quality treatment to the injured.

Virudhunagar MP B. Manickam Tagore has sought ₹10 lakh in relief to the family members of the deceased.

Compensation ordered

In Chennai, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami ordered ₹2 lakh each in compensation to the families of the deceased. He also ordered ₹1 lakh each in compensation to the severely injured persons from the Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund.

126,2020/10/24,VCK calls for State-wide protest demanding ban on Manusmriti,"Controversy erupts over Thirumavalavan’s remarks on women.

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) founder and Chidambaram MP Thol. Thirumavalavan has called a State-wide protest on Saturday to urge the State and Central governments to ban the Hindu religious text, Manusmriti, on the grounds that it demeans women, the backward castes and indigenous groups, and spreads hatred against them.

The Dravidar Kazhagam, the Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam and the May 17 movement have pledged support to the protest.

In a statement, Mr. Thirumavalavan said the Manusmriti, believed to have been written almost 2,000 years ago, speaks ill of the working class, as a whole, instigates violence against them and justifies their murder. “It portrays women in a bad light. It states that a particular ‘varna’ or caste does not have the right to live. This is why Ambedkar burnt the Manusmriti in 1927 and exposed its inhumanity in many of his books,” he said.

Mr. Thirumavalavan said the Manusmriti lost its place as law of the land after the British took over India and created a law that considered everyone equal. “The Sanatana forces that are in power today are again trying to reorganise power structures according to the Manusmriti. This is why violence against women is growing in India. This is why the question on whether India is being governed according to the Constitution... or the Manusmriti is being raised,” he said.

A controversy over Mr. Thirumavalavan’s comments in a speech erupted after the protest was announced. A video of the speech, at a web-based conference organised last month by the European Union Periyar Ambedkar Comrades’ Federation, on the topic “Periyar and Indian Politics”, went viral. In the clip, he states, “As per Hindu Dharma, all women are created by God as prostitutes. They are prostitutes as per Hindu Dharma...Manu Dharma. The status of all women is less than that of a man.”

Actor Kushboo Sundar of the BJP condemned Mr. Thirumavalavan’s statement and demanded that he prove his claim that the Manusmriti says “women are prostitutes”. Asked whether she had read the Manusmriti, Ms. Kushboo said there was “not a single word that demeans women”.

The Cyber Crime Wing of the CCB booked a case on Friday against Mr. Thirumavalavan based on an online complaint from Ashwathaman, a BJP functionary.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/notkh0/article32933355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THTHRIUMAVALAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vck-calls-for-state-wide-protest-demanding-ban-on-manusmriti/article32933356.ece

M. Mallanna is a tenant farmer as well as landlord in Mallareddypet village in Sadashivapet madnal. He has about 25 acres of land and leased out 35 acres more. He cultivated cotton on total 60 acres. He has already paid the lease amount of ₹5.25 lakh in advance as per the norms.

On an average each farmer in this village has spent about ₹20,000 per acre which comes to about ₹12 lakh in the case of Mallanna. The total debt incurred by him for this season stood at ₹17.25 lakh.

Had the cotton been harvested by the time of Dasara, as per schedule, Mallanna might have earned a few lakhs of rupees and cleared his debts. This was the case not only for Mallanna but several other farmers in the district.

Patti Ramesh, Vadde Yadagiri and others of Pottipally and P Ravinder of Machireddypally are neck deep in trouble with their debts mounting. For the past three years, lack of rains worried farmers while this year it was excess rain that damaged the crops totally. At some places cotton is getting regenerated from the balls thereby damaging the crop totally.

“Usually, we get eight quintals of yield for an acre of paddy and a qunital can be sold at ₹5,600 of minimum support price. Our crop was already damaged and discoloured. Who will buy the crop?” asked P. Ravinder of Machireddypaplly.

131,2020/10/24,COVID acts as spoiler to Bathukamma festivities,"Rain plays spoilsport for flower growers

The crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the recent spell of unseasonal rains played a spoilsport for flower growers mainly the marigold farmers with sharp slump in demand for flowers in the prime floral festival Bathukamma season.

Marigold farmers in Rahgunadhapalem, Konijerla, Bonakal and a few other mandals bore the brunt of the recent bout of untimely rainfall. The unseasonal rains hit the farmers in the crucial harvesting season, dashing their hopes of good returns in the Bathukamma and Sarannavaratri festival season. The low yield of flower produce due to reasons like rain devastation and the decline in the overall area under marigold cultivation in the district this year has led to a sharp rise in the price of marigold in the market. But there are a very few takers for the flowers, the cost of which almost tripled from ₹50 to ₹60 per kg last year to anywhere between ₹150 to ₹200 per kg this year.

In the absence of a flower market, a long-felt demand of flower growers in the district, some greedy middlemen are minting money by exploiting the upsurge in prices of marigold, depriving the farmers of remunerative price, sources said.

We have cultivated marigold against all odds by incurring high production cost during the coronavirus lockdown a few months ago, recalled Premalatha, a marigold grower of Raghunadhapalem.

""The recent bout of untimely rains caused extensive damage to the flower plants,"" she rued, deploring that they were left in dire straits in the midst of the floral festival season.

133,2020/10/24,Punjab rape and murder | Amarinder Singh dismisses BJP’s criticism as ‘political puffery’,"Our govt. promptly arrested the accused: Amarinder Singh

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday dismissed the attack by BJP leaders on his government over the Hoshiarpur rape and murder case, terming the remarks of Union Ministers Nirmala Sitharaman and Prakash Javadekar as “political puffery”.

“Contrary to what these leaders were claiming, there is no comparison between the Hoshiarpur and the Hathras cases,” Capt. Amarinder said, pointing out in the latter instance, the Uttar Pradesh government and the police had not only failed to initiate stern action but also allegedly tried to cover up the matter to benefit the upper-caste accused. This, he said, was in sharp contrast to the prompt action taken by the Punjab police, which immediately arrested the accused.

Ridiculing the BJP leaders’ criticism of the “so-called silence of the Congress leadership on the Hoshiarpur case”, Capt. Amarinder pointed out that his party had been forced to speak up and protest in the Hathras case because the State had failed to get justice for the Dalit girl there. “Had the BJP government in U.P responded as effectively and speedily as we did in Punjab, neither the Congress and the Gandhis, nor scores of NGOs, lawyers, human rights activists would have been forced to take to the streets to fight for the victim,” he added.

“No BJP leader had uttered a word in protest against the acts of omission and commission of the U.P government and police in the Hathras case, when the entire nation was in angry uproar,” he said, slamming the party over its politically motivated reaction to the Hoshiarpur incident.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/w5qia5/article32937421.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THRDAMARINDER1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-rape-and-murder-amarinder-singh-dismisses-bjps-criticism-as-political-puffery/article32937422.ece
134,2020/10/24,Rajasthan Assembly session on new farm Bills from October 31,"To follow Punjab’s lead, reject Centre’s farm legislations

A special session of the Rajasthan Assembly to bring in Amendment Bills against the Centre’s recent farm laws will begin here on October 31. Speaker C.P. Joshi on Saturday convened the session, which was adjourned on August 24 after the Congress government won the confidence vote on the floor of the House.

The notification for convening the session was issued after the State government made a recommendation for carrying out an “urgent legislative work”.

Official sources said the Governor's permission for reconvening the sitting was not required because the Assembly was earlier only adjourned without the formal orders for prorogation.

The Gehlot government is set to introduce the Bills, on the lines of those in Punjab, formally rejecting the new Central Farm Acts and nullifying their applicability to the State. The Assembly may also adopt a resolution against the Centre’s “rigid stand” on the issue despite strong opposition by large sections of farmers across the country.

The State Council of Ministers had earlier this week approved the proposal to bring the Bills in the Assembly, while laying emphasis on a mandatory provision for procurement of agricultural produce at minimum support prices. There may be penal provisions for those paying less than MSP as in the Punjab bills.

As many as seven crops — wheat, gram, mustard, moong, urad, soybean and groundnut — are covered under MSP in Rajasthan. The State’s proposed farm laws may also restore the powers for settlement of disputes in crop procurement to the civil courts.

The Chief Minister had recently indicated that Rajasthan would follow suit after the passage of Bills against the Central statutes in the Punjab Assembly. The Congress, which stood resolutely with the farmers, would continue to oppose the laws harming the agriculturists passed by the BJP-led government at the Centre, Mr. Gehlot had stated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/qbqfo5/article32937377.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJASTHANASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rajasthan-assembly-session-on-new-farm-bills-from-october-31/article32937378.ece

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Saturday said that the newly passed farm laws were not only against farmers but also against consumers, and linked them to the latest spurt in onion prices.

Addressing a press conference in Patna while campaigning for the Congress candidates in the Bihar Assembly polls, Mr. Baghel said that by amending the Essential Commodities Act, the Centre had now allowed hoarding by traders. A State government could act only in the event of a war, drought or a 100 % increase in prices, he added.

“This is a law for capitalists...It’s not even two months since the law was passed but the consumer can already see its impact. Onions that were selling at ₹30-40 is now selling for ₹70-80, and if you go to Kerala, it has crossed even ₹80,” Mr. Baghel said.

The Chhattisgarh Chief Minister said that even though the Act envisaged no government regulation other than under exceptional circumstances, the Centre had now been “forced to check the prices because of elections in Bihar and bypolls in Madhya Pradesh”.

“In his election rally, the Prime Minister had said that some Opposition parties are batting for middlemen (dalals). But I want to say it is you government that is helping capitalists and their middlemen. Don’t blame the Opposition,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jsql4/article32937264.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BAGHEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/baghel-links-new-farm-laws-to-rise-in-onion-prices/article32937265.ece

Chatar festival in the Bhawanipatna town of Odisha’s Kalahandi district, which is usually marked by the sacrifice of thousands of animals and birds, passed off without much bloodshed on Friday.

Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Kalahandi district administration imposed a strict security blanket that did not let devotees kill animals and birds in propitiating Goddess Manikeswari.

Every year, the idol of Goddess Manikeswari is taken to Jena Khal on the outskirts of the town, and after the performance of secret rituals, the deity returns to her abode. The return journey is known as Chatar Yatra.

Lakhs of devotees from Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and West Bengal participate in the festival. A three kilometre main thoroughfare, and nearby lanes and by-lanes, turn red with animal blood. On this occasion, almost every family has an animal or bird to sacrifice.

This year, the Orissa High Court had ordered ban on animal sacrifice. “No person including the State shall be allowed to sacrifice any animal or bird during ‘Chatar Yatra’ festival on the public road or in and around the precincts of the temple,” the Orissa HC had ordered while acting on a public interest litigation.

“God is the creator of the universe. He has created the human beings, animals, birds and all the species on this earth. The animals and birds breathe like us. They have also a right to live in harmony with human beings and the nature. Like the parents cannot tolerate to see the blood of their children, deity cannot be pleased by sacrificing the animals,” it observed.

The HC had directed the administration to generate awareness among people before prohibiting the animal sacrifice.

However, Supreme Court had stayed the Orissa HC court order, which meant there was no restriction on animal sacrifice.

“People have celebrated the festival by staying inside their home. We had taken a preparatory meeting on the COVID-19 pandemic and sought cooperation. It was then decided that Chatar festival would be held without any devotees,” said Kalahandi District Collector Gavali Parag Harshad.

Similarly, Kalahandi Superintendent of Police Battula Gangadhar said that, as matter of precaution to avoid crowds in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, 13 platoons of police were deployed. Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC were imposed to avoid assembling of devotees.

In the wee hours of Saturday, the festival was celebrated with a limited numbers of devotees and government officials. A troupe of traditional Ghumura dancers participated in the procession.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hsg4dr/article32936708.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHATRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/animals-spared-of-sacrifice-in-pandemic-hit-odisha/article32936709.ece
137,2020/10/24,Bulandshahr Sadar bypoll could signal a socio-political realignment in U.P.,"With Mayawati ‘missing’ and an all-powerful BJP, some Dalit leaders are pushing for a transition to the Azad Samaj Party.

At Akbarpur Raina village in Gulaothi block of Bulandshahr, Chanderpal Singh Jatav is unequivocal in his assessment of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati. She should “retire”, he says, and make way for Chandrashekhar Azad as he could “protect Dalit pride” as she once did.

He had lost his son in a freak accident and no political party could get him compensation. Now, he has pinned his hope on the Azad Samaj Party because he had seen its leader hitting the road for Dalit causes, including in the latest Hathras case, where a Dalit girl was killed and allegedly gang-raped by four upper caste men.

With the Azad Samaj Party jumping into the electoral politics of Uttar Pradesh, in the patron-client pattern of politics in north India, the upcoming bypoll for Bulandshahr Sadar seat is presenting possibilities of a socio-political realignment in the State.

In Mr. Singh’s outer courtyard, Mahendra Singh, who once used to be Mayawati’s pointsman in west U.P. and Delhi, is selling Azad Samaj Party to a group of Jatavs. Invoking Bhimrao Ambedkar, he says, political democracy without social democracy is meaningless. “She became U.P.’s Chief Minister four times. Did any Dalit get a licence or permit?” he asks. He reminds his listeners of the time under BSP founder Kanshiram when the party was flourishing in four States. “Now it has reduced to one. Who would take the responsibility?” he asks.

He admits the churning would take time. “This bypoll is about sending a message that the future of the Bahujan Samaj (referring to Muslims and Dalits) is with the Azad Samaj Party as Behenji (Mayawati) has made it amply clear that she won’t be part of any coalition that would be formed to take on the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) in 2022. These people fear that from 18, the BSP might come down to eight. We want Azad to be the face of the coalition against the BJP,” he asserts.

In bucolic Bulandshahr, pride is what every political party is keen on preserving in the by-poll for the Sadar seat. The response to the newly promulgated farm laws is what one went looking for, but on the ground, farmers, particularly Jats, who own large tracts of land in the area, are more concerned about the lathi charge that their leader Jayant Chaudhary received in Hathras when he went to meet the family of the victim.

“Lathi is something we wield, how can we be at the wrong end of it?” asks Virendra Singh, an aged farmer leader at the camp office of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). Old-timers in “farmer politics” advise the RLD vice president, who likes to present the educated face of farmers, to hit the street more often. They tell him to take a leaf out of Chandrashekhar Azad’s book.

They have had memories of the early 1990s when, in Gulaothi, Mayawati symbolically talked of signs of upper caste nails on the Dalit woman’s body. “Her speeches stoked fire that would burn anything that came in her way. Today, Azad tries to create the same spell,” says a local RLD leader working closely with the Samajwadi Party (SP)-RLD candidate Praveen Kumar Singh.

While at the SP-RLD meeting in Bhainsoli-Sharifpur village, the BSP is described as the “BJP ki beti” (daughter of the BJP) for being afraid of Central agencies and not being able to stand up for Muslims during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)-National Register for Citizens (NRC) protests, at the BSP’s camp office in Upper Court area, party workers question the source of Azad’s funding.

“Both ASP (Ambedkar Samaj Party) and AIMIM (All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen) are being propelled by the BJP to cut into the BSP vote,” says Prem Pal Singh, president of the Shikarpur Assembly segment of the party in the district. Finding it hard to defend their supremo’s absence from the rough and tumble of politics, BSP party workers maintain that Ms. Mayawati is still the glue that could hold the Jatavs and Muslims together. “After the Hathras case, even the Valmikis will come into our fold as they have realised who shoved brooms in the hands of those who held pens in the Ramayana period (in a reference to the author of the epic),” says Mr. Singh.

Her absence from Hathras is described as a way to keep herself away from physical harm. “Sab pit rahe hain (everybody is getting beaten up),” says Mohd Lukman, a meat businessman. “And the media is not reporting ‘our stories’,” he adds.

The fear is palpable at the BSP camp office. “If a BJP worker goes to a police station and says that this Muslim boy was staring at us, an FIR is lodged in no time,” claims Mr. Lukman. “We are being threatened with the NSA (National Security Act) and the Gangster Act but if we go with a complaint, we get a lesson in social amity from the SHO (Station House Officer),” he adds.

But Mr. Singh keeps reminding the workers not to share stories of fear with the media. “It gives strength to the BJP’s narrative,” he muses. And, perhaps, Mr. Azad’s as well.

Social activist Zaheeruddin, who has been working in the region for a long-time, underlines that both the BSP and ASP have fielded Muslim candidates who have the image of a “bahubali” (strongman) in the area. “Both have made money through questionable means but the locals are in awe of them. If we find fault in others, we have to look within as well. In the long run, only a mohazaab (well-behaved) politician who has the support of both Hindus and Muslims could take on the BJP,” he says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/90xfdo/article31193252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28IN-CHIEF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bulandshahr-sadar-by-poll-could-signal-a-socio-political-realignment-in-up/article32936600.ece
138,2020/10/24,Manipur remains cut off following landslips in Senapati and Ukhrul districts,"Relief work is hampered by non-stop downpour. No loss of life, say police.

Manipur remains cut off following landslips in Senapati and Ukhrul districts on Friday night, official sources said on Saturday.

The first landslip took place at Khongnem in Senapati district. While 50 metres of NH 37 has been damaged, over 300 loaded and unloaded trucks and some private trucks and cars are stranded on either side of the cave-in along the national highway.

Police and district officials are at the site of the damage to supervise the repair work. Two trucks carrying machinery and one goods truck had been dragged down the deep gorge by the sliding mud and debris. Students at Maram and Senapati are extending help to the repair work. The work is hampered by the non-stop downpour. The police say there has been no casualty among the tribal villagers.

Reports from Ukhrul, a district bordering Myanmar, said there was a massive landslip near Halang village. Some neighbouring tribal villages have been cut off. Officials said men and machinery have been rushed to the two districts and clearance of the debris is under way. There is fear that there could be more landslips as Manipur is reeling under downpour.

Following torrential rains in the past few days, all major rivers are running above the danger level. The Waterways department has deployed labourers and officials in the trouble-prone areas. Officials said flood control material is kept in readiness for instant transportation and use. Officials and labourers are camping near the swollen rivers round the clock. The weather forecast is that there will be more rains in the next three days.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xsxcfu/article32936554.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THMANIPURANDLANDSLIDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/manipur-remains-cut-off-following-landslips-in-senapati-and-ukhrul-districts/article32936555.ece
139,2020/10/24,Farooq Abdullah prays for peace at Durga Nag temple,"He also prayed that displaced Kashmiri pandits return to their homes as soon as possible.

Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah on Saturday visited the ancient ‘Durga Nag’ temple here on the occasion of ‘Durga ashtami’ and ‘Ram navami’, and paid obeisance to the deity.

The National Conference (NC) leader, who turned 84 earlier this week, prayed for peace and wellbeing of humankind.

He arrived at the temple located at the Dalgate along with members of his party when priests from the Kashmiri pandit community were performing a ‘havan’ there.

“This is an important day for our Hindu brothers and sisters and this temple has a significance. I came to extend my greeting to them on the occasion of religious festivals being celebrated here,” Mr Abdullah, who is a Lok Sabha member, told reporters.

He also prayed that displaced Kashmiri pandits return to their homes as soon as possible.

Dressed in a traditional pathani suit, the NC leader was wearing a face guard in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. He also appealed to people to follow all protocols of social distancing at public places.

Durga Nag is believed to be a more than 700 years old temple.

140,2020/10/24,"Jammu & Kashmir Congress asks Mehbooba to desist from making ‘provocative’, ‘irresponsible’ remarks on national flag","Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma said, “Such statements are intolerable and unacceptable in any society.”

Asking former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti to desist from making highly provocative and irresponsible remarks on the national flag, the Congress unit in the Union Territory on Saturday strongly condemned the PDP chief’s statement on the tricolour.

Reacting to Mehbooba’s statement on the national flag, Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma said it is highly ‘provocative’ and ‘irresponsible’ and she has hurt the patriotic sentiments of people.

“Such statements are intolerable and unacceptable in any society,” he said. Mr. Sharma said the national flag is the symbol of the honour and dignity of the country and reminds people of the sacrifices of crores of Indians to achieve freedom and protect the country’s dignity, honour and territorial integrity.

“She should desist from making such outrageous utterances to hurt the sentiments of every Indian,” the Congress leader said.

In her first media interaction after her release from 14 months of detention, Mehbooba on Friday said she would hold the tricolour only when the separate flag of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir would be restored.

“As far as I am concerned, I have no interest in elections. Till the time the Constitution under which I used to contest elections is returned to us, Mehbooba Mufti has got nothing to do with elections, let me tell you that,” she said.

In an act seen as defiance, the flag of the erstwhile State was prominently placed on a table in front of the PDP president, along with the flag of her party, during the press conference. It was for the first time that the PDP displayed the flag of the erstwhile State at a party function or a presser.

“This is my flag,” Mehbooba said, pointing to the flag of the erstwhile State, when a reporter asked her about her statement that if Article 370 of the Constitution was revoked, there will be no one left to hold India’s flag.

“When this flag of ours is restored, we will hold that flag (tricolour) also. But we will not hold any other flag till the time our flag, which was robbed from us, comes into our hold,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/99mpzs/article32223760.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUFTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jammu-kashmir-congress-asks-mehbooba-to-desist-from-making-provocative-irresponsible-remarks-on-national-flag/article32936364.ece

A 16-year-old girl was shot dead after three men barged into her house late on Friday in Firozabad district over an eve-teasing incident to which she had protested, police and her family said.

Two accused were arrested and being interrogated, said the police.

The family of the victim said she had earlier retorted to the accused after they allegedly passed abusive comments at her while she was passing by on the street.

The girl’s father told the media that the men barged into his house in Rasulpur area and kicked the door open. The girl was shot in the head, he said.

“My daughter was studying in the 12th Standard. When she was coming home, they misbehaved with her and used abusive language. She had given them a strong reply,” said the girl’s father.

As per the girl’s father’s complaint, the incident happened at 11.45 p.m. on Friday.

Superintendent of Police Sachindra Patel said that the girl’s father told them that the assailants barged into the house as the gates were left open.

Mr. Patel also added that the neighbours of the family came to know about the incident only after the police arrived on the scene.

Given the circumstances and the people present on the spot, all aspects of the case are being minutely investigated, said the officer.

“There are contradictions in the statements given by the family,” he said.

143,2020/10/24,BJP demands Mehbooba Mufti’s arrest for her statement on national flag,"The PDP chief had said that she will only hold the national flag after the flag of Jammu and Kashmir is restored.

The Jammu and Kashmir BJP has demanded PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti’s arrest for her “seditious” remarks, wherein she said she would only hold the tricolour when the flag of the erstwhile State is restored.

The BJP said “no power on earth” can either hoist the State flag again or restore Article 370 of the Constitution, which granted a special status to the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir.

Addressing reporters on Friday for the first time since her release from a 14-month detention following the abrogation of Article 370 in August last year, Ms. Mufti said she will only hold the national flag after the flag of Jammu and Kashmir is restored.

In an act seen as defiance, the flag of the erstwhile State was prominently placed on a table in front of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president, along with that of her party, during a press conference.

“I request Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha to take cognisance of the seditious remarks of Mehbooba Mufti, book her for the seditious act and put her behind bars,” Jammu and Kashmir BJP president Ravinder Raina told reporters.

“We will sacrifice every drop of our blood for our flag, country and motherland. Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of our country, so only one flag can be hoisted in Jammu and Kashmir and that is the national flag,” he said.

Mr. Raina said the saffron party will not tolerate such “nefarious designs” aimed at instigating the people of Kashmir.

“I warn leaders like Mehbooba Mufti not to instigate the people of Kashmir. We will not allow anyone to disturb peace, normalcy and brotherhood. In case anything wrong happens, she will have to face the consequences,” he said.

If Kashmiri leaders are feeling insecure in India, they can go to Pakistan and China, he added.

During her presser, Ms. Mufti accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of “looting” the dignity of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

“We had acceded to a liberal, democratic, secular India. Let me tell them that we are not comfortable, we are incompatible with today’s India where minorities and Dalits are not safe and where they tried to disrespect us by looting our dignity,” she said.

Referring to the Centre’s move to abrogate Article 370 on August 5 last year, Mr. Raina said no decision taken by the government can be reversed.

He said Article 370 gave rise to separatism, terrorism and was instrumental behind thousands of killings.

“As the government has permanently scrapped Article 370, no power on earth can restore it. No power on earth can hoist any flag other than the national flag in Jammu and Kashmir,” the BJP leader said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/v1fu1y/article32932725.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MEHBOOBA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-demands-mehbooba-muftis-arrest-for-her-statement-on-national-flag/article32935579.ece
144,2020/10/24,Punjab sees sharp rise in stubble burning,"Over 9,400 cases reported in one month

With paddy harvesting gaining pace in Punjab, the key grain producing State is witnessing a sharp rise in stubble burning this kharif (summer) season.

As per the government data based on satellite aggregation, 9,434 cases of stubble fire occurrence were reported between September 21 and October 21 in the State. Last year, there were 3,515 farm fire incidents between October 1 and October 21. The State has so far seen 5,282 more cases of farm fire than the last season.

Tarn Taran on top

Tarn Taran district saw the highest number of farm fire cases at 2,086, while Amritsar with 1,657 cases is at the second spot. Ferozpur district recorded as many as 1,033 cases and is third on the list, according to the Punjab Pollution Control Board.

Paddy has been grown over 27 lakh hectares of land in Punjab this year. This includes cultivation of Basmati on 7 lakh hectares. Cumulatively, this is expected to yield paddy residue of 16.50 million tonnes.

Stubble burning, close to the autumn season every year, has been one of the contributing factors to air pollution across the northern region, including New Delhi, causing respiratory problems.

Early harvesting

Krunesh Garg, member-secretary of the Punjab Pollution Control Board, said the key reason for the higher number of fire cases was the early harvesting. “Owing to COVID-19 situation, paddy planting got advanced this year and hence the harvesting has been early as well,” he said.

Amid concerns of labour shortage during the nationwide lockdown following the COVID-19 outbreak, the Punjab government had announced advancement in the paddy nursery sowing and transplantation dates by 10 days. The operations (nursery and transplantation) commenced on May 10 and June 10 respectively, instead of the May 20 fixed earlier by the agriculture department for sowing of paddy and June 20 for transplantation.

“Also, this year the weather conditions have been comparatively dry than last year, which is another factor for early harvesting. I am sure that the final figure of fire cases and burnt area will be lower than previous years at the end of the season,” he said.

As part of the State’s stubble management strategy, over 23,500 more agri-machines are being provided this year to farmers, either individually or in groups or through cooperative societies at a subsidy ranging from 50% to 80% by the agriculture department. This is in addition to 51,000 paddy straw in-situ management machines provided over the past two years.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-sees-sharp-rise-in-stubble-burning/article32933795.ece
145,2020/10/24,Varanasi weavers’ strike continues,"Weavers in Varanasi and adjoining districts are continuing their strike demanding restoration of the flat rate electricity bill and withdrawal of the meter system introduced earlier this year. The powerloom weavers, on strike since October 15, alleged that since the implementation of the new meter system, the electricity department had been harassing them to pay higher rates or face connection cuts.

The weavers earlier went on a strike on September 1 but two days later, their delegation met a senior government official in Lucknow and the two sides reportedly reached an understanding. As part of the compromise, the government would charge them on the basis of the previous flat rate till July and from August, a new system would be devised within 15 days of the meeting after consultation with the weavers.

‘Feeling betrayed’

However, no official order has been passed yet, said Iftekhar Ahmed Ansari, president of the U.P. Bunkar Sabha, which has been leading the strike. He added power connections continued to be cut and the government again implemented the new system with enforcement from August. “We feel betrayed,” said Mr. Ansari.

146,2020/10/24,Valmiki families in Ghaziabad village ‘convert’ to Buddhism,"Local administration says no proof of any such ceremony

Members of the Valmiki community in Karhera village of Ghaziabad claim that they have “converted” to Buddhism as a mark of protest against atrocities being committed against the Dalits, particularly the Hathras case where a Dalit girl was allegedly gang-raped and murdered by four upper caste men.

The local authorities, however, deny any such conversion ceremony was held. An FIR has been registered in Sahibabad police station against unknown persons under Sections 153A and 505 of IPC for promoting enmity between communities.

‘Finding faults’

In a ceremony conducted under the banner of the Buddhist Society of India, 236 members of the community converted to Buddhism on October 14, said Rajratna Ambedkar, the great-grandnephew of B.R. Ambedkar. “Local administration is finding faults with the certificates issued and one MLA is even attributing ulterior motives to the conversion,” said Mr. Ambedkar.

He was referring to the Loni MLA Nand Kishore Gurjar’s letter to the Home Minister alleging that the Mumbai-based Society had links with Pakistan’s ISI and underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. “We would take legal action against him. Buddhism is an Indian religion and we don’t believe in forcefully converting anybody,” said Mr. Ambedkar.

On the Ghaziabad administration’s charge that the certificates didn’t have serial numbers and blank certificates were distributed, Mr. Ambedkar said they would soon file affidavits in court. “Because of the COVID 19 protocol, around 50 members were given certificates during the ceremony while those of the rest were given to the family members.”

In an inquiry ordered by District Magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, ADM (City) Shailendra Kumar Singh found that no evidence was provided for the ‘conversion’. In most of the certificates, correct names and addresses were not indicated. The date and registration numbers were also missing. Some certificates were blank on which names and addresses could be written. The report further said that in the memorandum submitted by the local people, only local problems had been mentioned and that there was no reference of conversion. “The issues raised in the memorandum are being addressed,” said Mr. Singh in the report.

Karhera is an urban village in Ghaziabad. Inderdas Maharaj, whose grandson Pawan Valmiki allegedly invited the Buddhist Society of India, said there were about 70-80 Valmiki families in the village dominated by the upper caste families. “We are living here for generations and never faced any social tension. I conduct ‘satsang’ in the Valmiki temple in the locality and get respect from all. After the Hathras episode, my grandson Pawan made me realise that we are feeling suffocated in this ‘house’, it’s time to shift to another ‘house,” said the 73-year-old.

“The administration has raised some questions. We will answer them but I feel it is a matter of faith. When we were in this faith, we were never asked to show any papers,” he said.

After the incident, he said, the administration had “come into action.” “Earlier, even the ward member would not show up but now officials of all the departments are coming,” he laughed.

Showing his certificate, Aman said they were asked to write down problems. “Now the administration is saying that our concern was not the atrocity faced by our sister in Hathras and that we were protesting against the civic issues,” he said.

Keshav Kumar, Circle Officer, Sahibabad, said the FIR was registered on the complaint of a local named Montu Chandel Valmiki.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bbiysg/article32933791.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24HATHRAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/valmiki-families-in-ghaziabad-village-convert-to-buddhism/article32933792.ece
147,2020/10/24,‘BJP trying to divide society on caste lines’,"Party’s tactics will never succeed in Punjab, says Chief Minister Amarinder

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday accused the BJP of trying to divide society on caste lines to promote its political interests.

Referring to the BJP’s attempt to take out a so-called ‘Dalit Insaf Yatra’ on October 22 without taking due permissions, Capt. Amarinder said, “These divisive tactics will never succeed in Punjab, whose people are happily living together for their collective progress.”

Capt. Amarinder said the BJP has no moral right to talk about Dalit rights, which they had been brazenly trampling wherever they were in power.

He said statistics showed that Uttar Pradesh, under the BJP rule, accounts for over 25% of the total cases of atrocities against the Scheduled Caste people in the country, and had recorded the highest number of such incidents in 2018.

“Is this your definition of justice for Dalits? Is this what you are offering the SC people of Punjab,” he asked the BJP.

‘Failed the farmers’

The Chief Minister said the BJP, finding itself totally cornered over the farm laws, was indulging in theatrics and mispropaganda with the sole motive of diverting public attention.

“The fact is that the party has completely failed the farmers and also the SC students, whom its national leadership had deprived of access to higher education by abruptly withdrawing from the Central post-matric scholarship scheme,” he said in a statement.

Capt. Amarinder attributed the BJP’s attempted rally to the fact that it was rattled over the State government’s successful launch of its scholarship scheme for the SC students. “Despite suffering ₹800 crore losses due to the anti-Dalit decision of the BJP-led Union government, the cash-strapped Punjab government had not only introduced a new scheme – B.R. Ambedkar SC Post-Matric Scholarship - for SC students, but even expanded its ambit to benefit more youngsters,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6tibnb/article32933789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24CAPT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-trying-to-divide-society-on-caste-lines/article32933790.ece
148,2020/10/24,Family claims man beaten to death in Similipal tiger reserve,"Odisha Forest Department says staffers spotted the deceased lying unconscious during patrolling

A man was beaten to death by Forest Department personnel inside the Similipal Forest, a tiger reserve, in Odisha’s Mayurbhanj district, his family members alleged on Friday.

The Forest Department, however, disputed the claim saying the deceased was spotted lying unconscious by its personnel while they were patrolling inside the forest.

Gajendra Naik (40), a resident of Nachhipur village under the Kaptipada police station limits, died on Thursday morning, 10 days after he was hospitalised. Family members and villagers staged a demonstration with the body in front of the Podadiha beat on Friday. They demanded compensation for the family and punishment to the Forest Department personnel.

“We eke our livelihood by collecting non-timber forest produce. My husband had gone into the forest on October 9, but did not return. Family members and some villagers went looking for him, but could not find him. Two days later, the Forest Department informed us that my husband was admitted to a hospital in a serious condition,” said Binodini Naik, wife of the deceased.

“The forest personnel told us that my husband may have injured himself falling from a height. I had doubts about this as he did not have any injuries apart from blood stains in the ear and mouth.

149,2020/10/24,Indian Premier League 2020 | KXIP snatches win from under SRH’s nose,"Defending 126, Jordan and Arshdeep do the star turn as Rahul’s men continue their ascent

Chris Jordan’s three for 17 helped Kings XI Punjab defend the lowest total — 126 — this edition and edge past Sunrisers Hyderabad by 12 runs at the Dubai International Stadium on Saturday.

With SRH needing 17 off the last two overs, KXIP captain K.L. Rahul took a gamble and bowled Jordan in the penultimate over.

The Englishman vindicated the decision, conceding just three and picking up the wickets of Jason Holder and Rashid Khan off successive deliveries.

The slide

Arshdeep Singh (three for 23) then defended 14 off the final over as SRH slipped to 114 all out after being 56 for no loss at one stage.

It was Arshdeep’s dismissal of Vijay Shankar in the 18th over that opened the floodgates after SRH had remained in the chase for most part. Jonny Bairstow (19, 20b, 4x4) and David Warner (35, 20b, 3x4, 2x6) infused urgency, adding 56.

Warner was out caught-behind off Ravi Bishnoi (one for 13) after a referral. Bairstow and Abdul Samad fell soon after.

Manish Pandey and Shankar arrested the slide with a 33-run fourth-wicket stand. But once they fell, the KXIP bowlers took over and delivered the team’s fourth consecutive victory.

Slow start

Earlier, Rashid (4-0-14-2) spearheaded an incisive bowling performance for SRH after it asked KXIP to bat. Rahul (27, 27b, 2x4, 1x6) and Mandeep Singh — opening the innings in the absence of Mayank Agarwal — were off to a slow start.

Sandeep had Mandeep caught at deep square-leg for his 100th IPL wicket. Chris Gayle started with a couple of boundaries, but T. Natarajan (none for 23), Rashid and Holder (two for 27) kept the batsmen on a tight leash.

The pressure eventually told when Gayle and Rahul fell off successive deliveries, leaving KXIP struggling at 69 for three after 11 overs. Nicholas Pooran and Glenn Maxwell were watchful, but before the duo could shift gears, Sandeep dismissed Maxwell in the 14th over.

Pooran’s rescue act

When Rashid had Deepak Hooda stumped by Bairstow four balls later, KXIP was in a spot of bother. The otherwise free-stroking Pooran remained unbeaten on 32 oﬀ 28 balls (2x4), his cautious innings proving the difference in the end.

The day in numbers

Second lowest total defended by KXIP in the IPL after the 119 against MI in 2009.

This is the lowest target SRH has failed to achieve in the tournament. It had faltered while chasing 137 versus MI in 2019.

SRH lost its last seven wickets for just 14 runs to slump from 100/3 to 114 all out.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/eeuvxh/article32939946.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Punjabjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-kings-xi-punjab-vs-sunrisers-hyderabad-in-dubai/article32936858.ece
150,2020/10/24,Under-19 World Cup-winner Tanmay Srivastava retires from cricket,"The batsman from Uttar Pradesh, who was a key member of the World Cup-winning squad in 2008, did not specify his new plans

Mumbai Batsman Tanmay Srivastava, who was part of India’s Under-19 World Cup winning team in 2008, announced his retirement from all forms of cricket on Saturday, saying he has found new dreams and bigger aspirations to work towards.

The 30-year-old left-hander took to social media to make the announcement but did not specify his new plans.

“It’s time to bid adieu to my cricketing playing career! I’ve built memories, made friends, achieved the best I could in these playing Junior Cricket, Ranji Trophy and most-importantly being a good performer in U-19 World Cup, 2008 and bringing the cup home with the team!!,” the Kanpur-born cricketer tweeted.

In a lengthy note that followed, Srivastava thanked his coaches, Uttar Pradesh cricket administrators, parents and wife for being a constant source of support.

“I think I have made enough cricketing memories on and off the field to last me a lifetime. For all those who still feel, I should have not retired yet, well...,” he said.

“I have new dreams and bigger aspirations and now is the time to work towards them. Now is the time for the next chapter.”

Srivastava played 90 first-class matches and scored 4,918 runs, with 10 centuries and 27 fifties to his name. He could, however, never make the cut for senior national team.

He represented Uttar Pradesh and later captained Uttarakhand in domestic cricket. In the IPL, he turned up for Kings XI Punjab and the now-defunct Kochi Tuskers.

In the 2008 U-19 World Cup in Malaysia, Srivastava had finished as the tournament’s leading run-scorer with 262 runs and played a key role in the final, scoring 43, which the Indian team had won.

That U-19 team in 2008 was led by current India skipper Virat Kohli.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/5rb4zd/article32936551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TANMAYKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/under-19-world-cup-winner-tanmay-srivastava-retires-from-cricket/article32936552.ece
151,2020/10/24,"Indian Premier League 2020 | Varun bamboozles DC, keeps KKR afloat","The mystery spinner’s five for 20 complements the efforts of Rana (81) and Narine (64).

Varun Chakravarthy’s mystifying spin (4-0-20-5) left the Delhi Capitals befuddled as it slumped to a 59-run defeat against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

After Nitish Rana (81, 53b, 13x4, 1x6) and Sunil Narine (64, 32b, 6x4, 4x6) — back in the team after a four-game absence, during which his bowling action was cleared — forged a 115-run stand off just 56 balls to propel KKR to 194, Varun broke DC’s back during the chase. He dismissed every match-winner DC could boast of — Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant, Shimron Hetmyer, Marcus Stoinis and Axar Patel.

The win helped KKR stay in the race for the playoffs.

DC benched an under-performing Prithvi Shaw and paired Ajinkya Rahane with Shikhar Dhawan. But that move did not yield the desired result as Pat Cummins sent both packing early.

Dream spell

Shreyas (47, 38b, 5x4) and Pant (27, 33b, 2x4, 1x6) combined for 63 runs for the third wicket to leave the match interestingly poised. But Varun’s dream bowling in his first three overs (3-0-12-5) slammed the door shut. The DC batsmen struggled to pick him, and everyone except Axar fell while trying to slog. This was the 29-year-old’s maiden five-for.

Earlier, after being asked to bat first, KKR rode on Rana and Narine’s efforts. Having scored just 84 in its last outing against RCB, KKR was in trouble again at 42 for three. The left-handed duo stepped in to ensure that there were no further slip-ups. Rana, who was promoted to the opener’s slot, accelerated to perfection. Narine, at the other end, complemented his partner.

DC speedsters Anrich Nortje and Kagiso Rabada ran out of steam after prising out the three top-order batsmen while Ashwin was the most expensive, conceding 45 in his three overs. Still, the match hung in the balance until midway through DC’s chase before Varun made it his evening.

152,2020/10/24,Indian Premier League 2020 | Rajasthan faces the might of Mumbai in must-win clash,"Questions remain on whether Rohit, who suffered a hamstring injury and missed the game against CSK, will be available on Sunday.

Skipper Rohit Sharma’s fitness would be a concern for defending champions Mumbai Indians as they aim to continue their dominant run, while a depleted Rajasthan Royals would hope to stay afloat when the two teams clash in an IPL match in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.

Mumbai roared back to form by crushing Chennai Super Kings by 10 wickets on Friday after their Super Over loss to the Kings XI Punjab. RR, on the other hand, lost to the Sunrisers Hyderabad by 8 wickets in their last game.

Table-toppers MI are on course to make it to the play-offs but the game is crucial for Rajasthan, who are languishing at seventh place and a loss would mean a step closer to elimination.

Questions remain on whether Rohit, who suffered a hamstring injury and missed the game against CSK, will be available on Sunday for MI.

But Rohit’s absence was hardly felt on Friday as the young Ishan Kishan (261 runs) launched into CSK bowlers with gusto.

So did Quinton De Kock (368 runs), continuing his sublime run. In the event of Rohit missing out on Sunday as well, the two will open again.

Mumbai’s middle-order has also been among runs — be it Suryakumar Yadav (243 runs), Hardik Pandya (164 runs), swashbuckling West Indian all-rounder Kieron Pollard (208 runs) or Krunal Pandya (82 runs).

With their big-hitting ability, the Pandya brothers and Pollard are a threat to any opposition.

MI bowlers are also wreaking havoc, especially New Zealand left-arm pacer Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah, who are lethal upfront and in the death.

The two have accounted for 33 wickets, while Australian Nathan Coulter-Nile (2 wickets) has supported the duo.

Spinners Krunal (5 wickets) and Rahul Chahar (13 wickets) are equally aggressive in the middle overs.

For Rajasthan, the biggest worry is the form of skipper Steve Smith, who has made 265 runs from 11 matches and a mis-firing top-order.

In the course of the season, Rajasthan have made constant changes at the top and that has hurt them badly.

The team does possess quality players like Ben Strokes (110 runs), Sanju Samson (272 runs) and Jos Buttler (271 runs), but the trio has failed to deliver collectively.

With two crucial points at stake, the management would be hoping that the three click on Sunday, something which has not happened this season.

All-rounder Rahul Tewatia (224 runs and 7 wickets) has been a revelation with both the bat and ball, but too much is being left for him to achieve.

On the bowling front too, RR lack consistency.

Only Jofra Archer (15 wickets) has been effective with his pace but has failed to get support from fellow pacers Karthik Tyagi, Jaydev Unadkat and Ankit Rajpoot, who have 12 wickets combined. Spinner Shreyas Gopal has leaked 343 runs from 11 games.

Stokes, as a bowler, has also been unimpressive and has failed to get a single wicket so far.

RR head coach Andrew McDonald said the team has not been able to be at its best and it chances of making the play-offs are fading.

“Our destiny is probably in other teams’ hands now and as for us we need to keep believing, our challenge is seven wins and we’ll try to give our best to achieve that,” he conceded.

Teams (From):

Mumbai Indians: Rohit Sharma (c), Aditya Tare, Anmolpreet Singh, Anukul Roy, Chris Lynn, Dhawal Kulkarni, Digvijay Deshmukh, Hardik Pandya, Ishan Kishan, James Pattison, Jasprit Bumrah, Jayant Yadav, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Mitchell McClenaghan, Mohsin Khan, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Prince Balwant Rai, Quinton De Kock, Rahul Chahar, Saurabh Tiwary, Sherfane Rutherford, Suryakumar Yadav, Trent Boult.

153,2020/10/24,Joe Root terms Virat Kohli the most complete player across all formats,"England Test skipper lauds his Indian counterpart’s resolve shown in 2018 by producing 894 runs across the three formats after having a disastrous tour in 2014.

England Test skipper Joe Root considers Virat Kohli as the “most complete player” across all formats, saying he has an all-round game and his ability to chase down totals in white-ball cricket is “extraordinary“.

Root also called countryman Jos Buttler as the “most complete white-ball batsman” in the world currently.

It has been widely accepted that Kohli, New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson, Australia’s Steve Smith and Root are currently the leading batsmen in world Test cricket.

“Virat is probably the most complete player out of the three of them across formats. His ability to chase things down in the limited-overs format and to pace it as well as he does as often as he does and be not out at the end is extraordinary,” Root was quoted as saying by ESPNCricinfo.

“He’s got a very good all-round game but you wouldn’t say he’s weaker against spin or pace,” Root said.

Kohli followed up his disastrous 2014 tour of England by producing 894 runs across the three formats against the home team in 2018.

“He obviously struggled on his first tour to England, but he scored really heavily when he came back. And similarly, elsewhere in the world, he’s put in massive performances. All that with the weight of India on his shoulders, as well,” Root said.

The 29-year-old said he tries not to measure himself against other players but likes to watch the top three go about their business.

“I try not to measure myself against Kohli, Williamson and Smith. But I do watch a lot of how they go about constructing different types of innings across the three formats,” he said.

“You’re looking at three of the greatest players the game has seen. They’re three brilliant people to watch play and learn from. I’m not sure I’d put myself in their bracket, to be honest,” he added.

Root hailed Williamson’s technique and how the Kiwi finds a way to trust his defense under pressure.

“I look at how late Kane plays the ball, how still and correct he is. How, under pressure, he finds a way to trust his defence on any given surface. That’s a great quality to have,” Root said.

He added that despite not being the most graceful to watch, Smith is an exceptional player who is able to manipulate the bowlers to bowl where he wants.

“You look at Smith and at times he’s just awful to watch. But you’d pay to have him in your team. He’s a fantastic run-scorer. The way he thinks about the game and manages passages of play is exceptional,” Root said.

“He makes bowlers bowl where he wants them to and his self-confidence you can see by the way he leaves the ball and some of his idiosyncrasies,” Root added,

Talking about Buttler, the skipper said the wicketkeeper batsman has the ability to “demoralise” the opposition with his destructive batting.

“Jos has been the most complete white-ball batsman we’ve had ever. The way he can play a number of different scenarios. He can just demoralise attacks and very quickly swing games massively in your favour.”

Root said that the best of Buttler is yet to come, likening him to South African batting maestro AB de Villiers.

“I think he’s a phenomenal player and I still don’t think we’ve seen the best of him yet. Hopefully this summer in Test cricket can unlock doors for him.

“I saw a piece about AB de Villiers and he said it took him 50 Tests to work out his Test game. I think it’s very similar to Jos, to be honest.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/m03886/article32935948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THREUTERSKOHLIADNROOT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/joe-root-terms-virat-kohli-the-most-complete-player-across-all-formats/article32935949.ece
154,2020/10/24,A captain can’t run away: hurt Dhoni hopes to steer side to pride-saving wins,"CSK are all but out of reckoning from a play-offs spot.

The usually indefatigable Mahendra Singh Dhoni conceded to being hurt at the way Chennai Super Kings’ IPL campaign has hurtled from one disaster to another but ruled out benching himself from the remaining three games, saying “a captain can’t run away“.

CSK are all but out of reckoning from a play-offs spot and Dhoni said the three remaining games would be an exercise in understanding how the side should plan for the next season. They next take on Royal Challengers Bangalore on Sunday.

“We have to make the most of the next three games and it is good preparation for the next year. Identify the batsmen, who will bowl at the death and hopefully the players will soak up the pressure,” he said after the 10-wicket loss to Mumbai Indians here on Friday.

“Captain can’t run away, so I’ll be playing in all the games,” he added.

CSK have just six points from 11 matches and are at the bottom of the IPL points table. Dhoni said several factors have contributed to the dismal run.

“...it hasn’t been our year. Whether you lose by 8 or 10 wickets, it hardly matters, but where we are at this stage of the tournament, it does hurt. What you need to see is where we actually went wrong, right from the second game,” he said.

“There can be a 100 reasons, but one of the main things you ask yourself is whether you’ve played to the potential you’ve got no matter the conditions. When you put a good team on paper, have we done enough to back up the stats? And this year we haven’t.”

The former India captain said luck also did not favour CSK this time.

“It was more about the bowling. Rayudu got injured, the other batsman were maybe not there 200% and in cricket when you’re going through a tough phase, you need a bit of luck.

“The games we wanted to bat first, we haven’t won the toss, and there’s no dew and all of a sudden when we bat first there’s dew,” he said.

He said there have been just too many batting failures this season.

“You can’t always think the result will go your way. Even when you’re hurting, you try to smile and take it on the chin. I feel the boys have done that, they’ve tried to perform.”

Dhoni said the remaining three games will be an ideal opportunity to give a platform to the youngsters.

Victorious Mumbai Indians’ stand-in captain Kieron Pollard, on the other hand, described the win as a team effort.

“We wanted to bowl them out under 100 but Sam batted well. I think it was a total team effort,” said Pollard who led MI in the absence of injured Rohit Sharma.

“Two-three wickets early puts you in the game and to get 4-5 is fantastic. Then the openers going out and finishing off and not leaving any uncertainty was good.”

He said MI would want to finish in top-two in the league phase but said it’s about getting the points and not thinking about play-offs opponents.

“There’s always room for improvement, myself making some mistakes on the field, guys not being aware in certain situations. Maybe it’s no technical, but it’s things you need to speak about.”

On leading the side, he said, “It (captaincy is part and parcel of it, sometimes you don’t actually have to be a leader to be a leader.”

“I know a thing or two. So it was just a matter of me stepping in and it came off tonight. It was just matter of making right decisions, not giving them freebies.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/2rgq7g/article32935921.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DHONI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/a-captain-cant-run-away-hurt-dhoni-hopes-to-steer-side-to-pride-saving-wins/article32935919.ece
155,2020/10/24,IPL 2020 | Embattled CSK takes on RCB in a battle to re-discover winning touch,"CSK, with six points from 11 games, still have a theoretical chance to make it to the playoffs, provided they do not lose any of their remaining three games, improve their net run-rate and all other match results go their way.

Their house in complete disarray after eight defeats from 11 outings, Chennai Super Kings will look to give their forgettable campaign a semblance of respectability when they take on in-form Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League in Dubai on Sunday.

CSK, with six points from 11 games, still have a theoretical chance to make it to the playoffs, provided they do not lose any of their remaining three games, improve their net run-rate and all other match results go their way.

The three-time IPL winners have struggled in all departments of the game, leading to heavy criticism towards skipper MS Dhoni for not showing enough faith in the youngsters.

CSK brought in young Ruturaj Gaekwad and Narayan Jagadeesan against Mumbai Indians but both batsmen perished without opening their account.

The Super Kings batsmen were rocked by Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah’s devastating pace-bowling spell, slipping to 21 for five inside the powerplay.

Their bowlers also failed to make an impact as the “Yellow Army” suffered its first-ever 10-wicket defeat on Friday.

Sam Curran’s half century was the only saving grace for the CSK. With 173 runs and 10 wickets in 11 games, the England all-rounder has been their silver in a devastating season.

CSK is expected to continue giving opportunities to the youngsters, treating the remaining three games as an audition for the next season.

“We have to make the most of the next three games and it is good preparation for the next year. Identify the batsmen, who will bowl at the death and hopefully the players will soak up the pressure,” Dhoni said after the loss to MI.

They run into a RCB squad which has grown in confidence as the tournament has progressed. Virat Kohli and his men are placed third on the points table with 14 points, the same as the table toppers MI and Delhi Capitals.

They will aim to grab the two points on offer, while also trying to improve their net run-rate, which could play a vital role in deciding the top two teams heading to the playoffs.

RCB are coming on the back of two morale-boosting victories against Rajasthan Royals and Kokata Knight Riders.

While AB de Villiers single-handedly fetched them the win against the Royals, pacer Mohammed Siraj tormented KKR by bowling a sensational spell, including a double-wicket maiden, in the eight-wicket victory over the two-time champions.

The pace trio of Chris Morris, Isuru Udana and Navdeep Saini have done well for the team, while spinners Washington Sundar and Yuzvendra Chahal have also proved effective.

RCB’s strong batting line-up led by captain Kohli has also lived up to the billing. Young opener Devdutt Padikkal has looked in good touch, while de Villiers has been a key player.

The two team’s last game against each other was also on this ground, with RCB inflicting a 37-run defeat upon CSK.

156,2020/10/24,"IPL 2020 | Accuracy matters as wickets become slower and drier, says Boult","The left-arm seamer, who was roped in as a replacement for Lasith Malinga, scalped four wickets — three in the powerplay — to set up his team’s 10-wicket win over CSK.

Mumbai Indians’ pacer Trent Boult says he is reaping the rewards of consistent accuracy this IPL season on pitches which are getting slower and drier with each passing game.

The left-arm seamer, who was roped in by Mumbai Indians as a replacement for the experienced Lasith Malinga, scalped four wickets — three in the powerplay — to set up his team’s 10-wicket win over Chennai Super Kings in Sharjah on Friday.

“New franchise, different personnel, it’s been exciting to be out there playing (in this global situation). I think it was all pretty natural stuff, pitch the ball up, was nice to get some assistance,” said Boult, who has taken 16 wickets so far this IPL.

“I’ve been lucky to get the first over so if it’s going to swing, it’s going to be up front. The wickets are becoming a lot slower and lot drier. I think it just comes down to accuracy.”

Boult (4/18) and Jasprit Bumrah (2/25) bowled devastating pace-bowling spells in tandem to restrict CSK to 114 for 9.

Ishan Kishan (68 off 37), opening the innings in place of an injured Rohit Sharma, and Quinton de Kock (46 off 37) overhauled the target, scoring 116 for no loss in 12.2 overs for a dominating win.

“I was just trying to be positive. These type of totals are tricky. We are always busy when I’m batting with Quinny, and it’s good to bat with him because I get to learn from him, improvisation and all,” Kishan said.

The left-handed batsman said he worked on his ground shots during the off-season.

“It’s not easy for new batsmen to come in and start hitting. This match was really important for us because CSK is a very experienced side and it’s never an easy game against them,” he said.

But Rohit’s absence was hardly felt on Friday as the young Ishan Kishan (261 runs) launched into CSK bowlers with gusto.

So did Quinton De Kock (368 runs), continuing his sublime run. In the event of Rohit missing out on Sunday as well, the two will open again.

Mumbai’s middle-order has also been among runs -- be it Suryakumar Yadav (243 runs), Hardik Pandya (164 runs), swashbuckling West Indian all-rounder Kieron Pollard (208 runs) or Krunal Pandya (82 runs).

With their big-hitting ability, the Pandya brothers and Pollard are a threat to any opposition.

MI bowlers are also wreaking havoc, especially New Zealand left-arm pacer Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah, who are lethal upfront and in the death.

The two have accounted for 33 wickets, while Australian Nathan Coulter-Nile (2 wickets) has supported the duo.

Spinners Krunal (5 wickets) and Rahul Chahar (13 wickets) are equally aggressive in the middle overs and perform the dual task of containing and grabbing wickets with utmost ease.

For Rajasthan, the biggest worry is the form of skipper Steve Smith, who has made 265 runs from 11 matches and a mis-firing top-order.

In the course of the season, Rajasthan have made constant changes at the top and that has hurt them badly.

The team does possess quality players like Ben Strokes (110 runs), Sanju Samson (272 runs) and Jos Buttler (271 runs), but the trio has failed to deliver collectively.

With two crucial points at stake, the management would be hoping that the three click on Sunday, something which has not happened this season.

All-rounder Rahul Tewatia (224 runs and 7 wickets) has been a revelation with both the bat and ball, but too much is being left for him to achieve.

Their younger players are also getting starts but need to convert them and take responsibility in case the seniors misfire again.

On the bowling front too, RR lack consistency.

Only Jofra Archer (15 wickets) has been effective with his pace but has failed to get support from fellow pacers Karthik Tyagi, Jaydev Unadkat and Ankit Rajpoot, who have 12 wickets combined. Spinner Shreyas Gopal has leaked 343 runs from 11 games.

With Tyagi giving away 42 runs against SRH, he could be replaced by Varun Aaron. Stokes as a bowler has been unimpressive as he has failed to get a single wicket so far.

158,2020/10/24,Pakistan shifts T20Is against Zimbabwe to Rawalpindi due to poor air quality in Lahore,"The Pakistan Cricket Board has shifted next month’s three T20 Internationals against Zimbabwe from Lahore to Rawalpindi citing the deteriorating air quality here.

The three T20Is, which were earlier scheduled at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, will now be held at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on November 7, 8 and 10.

“Following the sudden deterioration in air quality and now further expected air pollution in November, we have made a swift decision to move the matches scheduled in Lahore,” PCB chief executive Wasim Khan said in a statement on Friday.

“The early onset of hazardous pollution and subsequent poor air quality meant that the risk to keep matches in Lahore at this stage was too great.”

The rescheduling also affects the remaining four Pakistan Super League matches which will now be held in Karachi.

“For the sake of everyone involved and to ensure the remaining four matches of the HBL PSL and the three T20Is against Zimbabwe were completed without risk or interruption, it was important to move the matches,” Wasim said.

Earlier this month, the ODI leg of Zimbabwe’s limited-overs tour of Pakistan, beginning on October 30, was moved from Multan to Rawalpindi due to logistical and operational challenges.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pakistan-shifts-t20is-against-zimbabwe-to-rawalpindi-due-to-poor-air-quality-in-lahore/article32935358.ece
159,2020/10/24,Indian Premier League 2020 | We have not played to our potential this season: M.S. Dhoni,"With today's loss, CSK are all but out of reckoning for a place in the play-offs with just six points from 11 matches

Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Friday admitted that his side failed to perform to their potential from the second game onwards as they suffered an embarrassing 10-wicket defeat at the hands of Mumbai Indians in an IPL match here.

With the loss, CSK are all but out of reckoning for a place in the play-offs with just six points from 11 matches. They remained rooted at the bottom place in the IPL points table.

“What you need to see is what are the things that are going wrong. Specially this year, it hasn’t been our year. Whether you lose by 8 or 10 wickets, it hardly matters, but where we are at this stage of the tournament, it does hurt,” he said.

“What you need to see is where we actually went wrong, right from the second game,” Dhoni said at the post-match presentation.

“There can be a 100 reasons, but one of the main things you ask yourself is whether you’ve played to the potential you’ve got no matter the conditions. When you put a good team on paper, have we done enough to back up the stats? And this year we haven’t.”

The former India captain said luck also did not favour CSK this time.

“It was more about the bowling. Rayudu got injured, the other batsman were maybe not there 200% and in cricket when you’re going through a tough phase, you need a bit of luck.

“The games we wanted to bat first, we haven’t won the toss, and there’s no dew and all of a sudden when we bat first there’s dew,” he said.

He said cumulatively there have been batting failures but termed it a part and parcel of the game.

“You can’t always think the result will go your way. Even when you’re hurting, you try to smile and take it on the chin. I feel the boys have done that, they’ve tried to perform.

“I think it’s important for us to have a clear picture of next year. There are lots of ifs and buts - auction, where the venues will be.”

Dhoni said the remaining three games will be an ideal opportunity to give the platform to the youngsters.

“See some of the youngsters in preparation for the next year, see who will bat and who bowls at the death and soaks the pressure. A few more who are on the bench will get games in the coming three games.”

Mumbai Indians’ stand-in captain Kieron Pollard described the win as a team effort.

“We wanted to bowl them out under 100 but Sam batted well. I think it was a total team effort,” said Pollard who led MI in the absence of injured Rohit Sharma.

“Two-three wickets early puts you in the game and to get 4-5 is fantastic. Then the openers going out and finishing off and not leaving any uncertainty was good.”

He said MI would want to finish in top-two in the league phase but said it’s about getting the points and not thinking about play-offs opponents.

“There’s always room for improvement, myself making some mistakes on the field, guys not being aware in certain situations. Maybe it’s no technical, but it’s things you need to speak about.”

On leading the side, he said, “It (captaincy is part and parcel of it, sometimes you don’t actually have to be a leader to be a leader.

“I know a thing or two. So it was just a matter of me stepping in and it came off tonight. It was just matter of making right decisions, not giving them freebies.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ouvx35/article32700051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DHONI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/we-have-not-played-to-our-potential-this-season-csk-captain-dhoni/article32933794.ece
160,2020/10/24,Three rare migratory birds spotted in Salem,"Birding enthusiasts from Salem have spotted and recorded three new rare migratory birds Whimbrel, Pacific Golden-Plover and Eurasian Wryneck during a bird walk organised recently. The enthusiasts said that it was first time these species have been recorded in Salem.

Birding enthusiasts under the Salem Ornithological Foundation conducted a bird walk recently as part of International October Big Bird Day celebrations here. Birding enthusiasts in teams visited various hotspots in the district and recorded 108 species as part of the event. The team, which went to areas close to the Mettur dam spotted and recorded Whimbrel, Pacific Golden-Plover and Eurasian Wryneck.

161,2020/10/24,Heavy rush in markets ahead of puja celebrations,"ERODE

Despite increase in price of fruits, flowers and other puja items, people in large numbers thronged vegetable and fruit markets to purchase items for Saraswati and Ayudha pujas that were to be celebrated on Sunday and Monday respectively.

Right from the morning, a good crowd was seen at Uzhavar Sandhai at Sampath Nagar and also at the retail vegetable and fruit market that functions at VOC Park Ground. Also, R.K.V. Road, Eswaran Kovil Street, Kongalamman Kovil Street, Manikoondu and Panneerselvam Park areas were crowded with people busy in making purchases for the puja celebration.

Temporary shops selling puffed rice, banana plants, flowers, fruits, mango leaves, ash gourd, coconuts and sugarcane had come up at various places on the roads and personal distancing norms were flouted in most of the places.

Consumers said that the price of flowers had gone up by over 200% while the price of fruits increased by 50% to 70% on Saturday.

Many shoppers pointed out that the flowers were sold at very high prices by the traders to reap good profit affecting the middle and low-income level people. “Traders refuse to give flowers even for ₹50”, said a shopper P. Murugesh of Thindal.

Most of the roads in market areas witnessed traffic snarls as policemen had a tough time in regulating the crowd and also the traffic.

Meanwhile, the Corporation has warned the residents and traders not to break ash gourd and coconuts on the roads which may cause accidents or inconvenience to road users. They said that safety of pedestrians and road users is important and asked people not to break items on the roads.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/heavy-rush-in-markets-ahead-of-puja-celebrations/article32937482.ece

165,2020/10/24,"Others cannot usurp role of police and create a false narrative, says Delhi Police Commissioner","Delhi Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava says if investigation into riots cases, which is ‘based on scientific evidence’, points at a set of accused persons, the police will do their job

Delhi Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava answered a range of questions from The Hindu on policing in the Capital, the impact of COVID-19 on the force and its role during the February communal riots in the city. Excerpts from written responses to questions sent to Mr. Shrivastava:

How many Delhi Police personnel have been afflicted by COVID-19? What steps have been taken to help the affected families?

Since the onset of COVID-19, 5,341 police personnel have been afflicted by the disease, of which 4,638 have recovered. We have unfortunately lost 22 brave men to COVID-19 in discharge of their duties. One of the hallmarks has been the manner in which the fallout of the pandemic was handled by the force. The officers and men continue to work hard, sincerely and relentlessly, in handling law and order, knowing well that it may expose them to the virus. We are encouraging them to build immunity against the novel coronavirus through Ayurvedic immunity drugs and yoga exercises. The Ministry of Ayush has provided us Ayurvedic medicines. SOPs and necessary infrastructure were created for afflicted policepersons to facilitate testing, hospitalisation, institutional quarantine etc. The health status of each affected policeperson is monitored at a senior level. Protective gear, including mask, is provided to all police personnel. Financial assistance and compensation is being provided to those who laid down their lives in the line of duty. During the crisis period the entire force has stood as one and the morale and camaraderie is high.

As Police Commissioner of Delhi, what are the major challenges on the law and order front during COVID-19 times?

Around 3 crore people reside in Delhi, including the floating population. Once the unlocking process began in June, one of the primary functions has been to ensure observance of COVID-19 protocols — of wearing mask, maintaining social distancing and hand sanitisation — without affecting the resumption of normal life. It is being achieved through meaningful prosecution and general awareness campaigns across the city. Resumption of religious, political and social activities without adversely impacting the observance of COVID-19 norms has remained a major challenge. The police force remains stretched to the maximum in keeping the crime situation under control while sparing sufficient manpower for other essential COVID-related duties. The exposure of police personnel to virus had to be regulated lest a large number of them go out of action as a result of sickness. Crime has been successfully checked despite its tendency to grow during adverse socio-economic conditions. The difficulties have further increased as jail capacities have reduced due to social distancing considerations in the jails.

Has the pandemic changed police work in any way?

Adapting to the changes in the environment is a pre-requisite to succeed during crisis period. Necessary changes in the manner of police working were made without losing effectiveness and compromising with the quality of work. Since it required minimisation of exposure of police personnel to the virus, physical meetings gave way to virtual meetings, social distancing among police personnel was achieved by hiring/taking over unused government buildings for the time being for work and use as barracks, going digital and paperless in a large way in place of files and paper reports. Videoconference is being used for examination of witnesses and complainants. It is used even for interrogating the accused, when a part of the investigation team joins through virtual means.

What are the new technologies Delhi Police has begun using to make it a modern, cutting-edge force?

During the COVID-19 period, we have been working at the back end to adapt to new technologies to make the functioning easy, efficient and transparent. Among the first is the introduction of the e-Beat Book. It enables a police officer in the field to access the various databases regarding crime, criminals, fingerprints, photographs, stolen vehicles, etc. Such an access while in the field facilitates instant decision-making that helps investigation and verification exercises. It has helped in curbing crime, arresting criminals and connecting with the residents.

Second, the Integrated Complaint Monitoring System (ICMS) is being tested for adoption soon. All complaints made to police either on paper, e-mail, social media, telephone, etc. will be monitored and the complainant informed about its progress. Since all the complaints are maintained digitally, its monitoring becomes easy and handling of complaints transparent.

Third, all final reports under Section 173 of the CrPC are being drafted digitally on the CCTNS platform. This is besides the recording of FIRs and maintaining crime and criminal data on the CCTNS.

Fourth, office working through e-Office has commenced in the Police Headquarters, which will soon be expanded todistrict and unit offices. e-HRMS (Human Resource Management System) will help attending to the grievances of the police personnel. The annual performance appraisal of all police personnel will be recorded digitally on e-Sparrow.

Fifth, a Social Media Cell has been created to attend to complaints/tweets on digital platform. There is a long wish list that is at different stages of implementation.

Will having three police ranges help Delhi Police in its law and order duties?

The different regions of Delhi have their own attendant issues requiring close supervision. Delhi is the national capital and issues need to be dealt adequately and promptly. Having three zones for attending to specific priorities of the respective regions would improve law and order management in Delhi.

Women’s safety continues to be an area of major concern in the city...

Women safety continues to be one of the top priorities for Delhi Police. One cannot deny the concerns every resident of Delhi has for women’s safety. Any crime against women is a threat to the very dignity of society. In the past nine months of the current year, crime against women has come down by approximately 30% compared to the same period last year. However, that leaves no room for complacency. A series of crime prevention measures, which include increased deployment in areas frequented by women, deployment of women police personnel as beat officers and in PCR vans, introduction of a number of women safety projects/apps such as Himmat Plus, Sashakti, Shishtachar, anti-stalking helpline 1096, finalisation of cases involving crime against women in 60 days, investigation of cases by women police officers, improving lighting in dark spots, installation of CCTV cameras, etc. have helped in keeping a check on crime against women. We are committed to making Delhi safer for women.

You took over as Police Commissioner in the middle of the Delhi riots, in which more than 50 people were killed. National Security Adviser Ajit Doval himself had to go to north-east Delhi as a confidence-building measure. The rioting continued in Delhi for four days. Did Delhi Police fail in performing its duties?

Delhi Police has a very good record in handling law and order, crime prevention and other areas requiring police attention. I am sure all possible measures were taken to maintain law and order in the city. It is not fair for me to comment on this issue for want of first-hand knowledge about the factors that were taken into consideration.

There are several videos allegedly showing police complicity during the riots, including that of policemen beating and asking a Muslim to sing the National Anthem. The man died. It’s been over seven months, what action has been taken against the policemen involved?

An FIR has already been registered in the matter. The video shows some police personnel assaulting and coaxing a few persons later identified as Faizan and four others. From the CCTV camera installed nearby and video clippings, some headway has been made. The police personnel on duty near the location have been examined. Delhi Police will not spare anyone who exceeded his brief.

The Delhi Minorities Commission in its report on the riots linked Kapil Mishra’s February 23 speech to the outbreak of violence. Why has no FIR been registered against the BJP leader for inciting violence?

I am not sure how it [the DMC] has come to this conclusion with the limited information and details it has. A chargesheet has already been filed in the court on the conspiracy leading to the communal riots. The police are mandated to investigate into the complaint recorded in the FIR and submit a final report (chargesheet) in the concerned court of law. It is in the court where every evidence produced by the police is evaluated and where it may be contested. Others cannot usurp the role of the police and create a false narrative. The court of law is the correct forum for this purpose. Investigation is judged on the basis of evidence and not perception. However, it has already been clarified that the investigation has concluded that riots and stone throwing took place at Chand Bagh on February 23 at 11 a.m. and the first injured reached the hospital at 12.15 p.m. as a medico-legal case. The video that shows Kapil Mishra talking to the media was taken around 3.30 p.m. on February 23. Therefore, on this count itself it is very clear that the riots had started much before Kapil Mishra was videographed making the statement.

Has any explanation been sought from DCP (North East) Ved Prakash Surya as to why he was seen in the frame when Mr. Mishra spoke of removing protesters from the Jafrabad area?

DCP (North East) Ved Prakash Surya was handling the law and order situation arising from the communal riots that took place on February 23 around 11 a.m. It is for this reason that he had already put on anti-riot gear and was in the affected area when Kapil Mishra arrived at Maujpur. Since stone throwing had taken place before the video was shot, they [stones] can be seen lying on the road in the videos.

Former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur has said that almost every State has weaponised sedition as a means of silencing critics. Do you agree with him?

I will refrain from commenting on the statement.

Civil society groups, many retired police officers and intellectuals have condemned what they describe as a crackdown against young activists who came to the fore in the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens...

I have already replied once before on this issue. Like in all cases we commenced the investigation with an open mind and relied heavily on scientific evidence, such as CCTV footage, WhatsApp chats, cellular connectivity, recovered deleted mobile phone data, geo-location, DNA analysis, Vahan database, facial reconstruction, fund flow analysis, etc. If the investigation based on scientific evidence points at a set of accused persons, the police will do their job. Besides scientific evidence, Delhi Police has examined a large majority of persons who either have a role in the north-east Delhi riots or have information that helped to arrive at the truth. It has questioned persons without regard to their religion and party affiliation. It has arrested 1,616 persons irrespective of their caste, religion, occupation or affiliation. Those arrested are almost equally distributed among both communities. I am sure the other community/group does not fit into the category of “young activists”. You should be equally concerned about them as well.

On January 5, masked persons carrying rods and sticks entered Jawaharlal Nehru University campus and thrashed students and teachers. There has been no arrest in the case so far. The video of a woman identified as Komal Sharma — associated with the ABVP — holding sticks inside the JNU campus was widely shared. Has any action been taken against Ms. Sharma and others behind the violence that night?

Delhi Police is investigating three cases related to the JNU incidents that occurred in January. The FIRs disclose names of students belonging to both [contending] factions in JNU. They have been examined in the cases. Komal Sharma was also examined. The case will be finalised soon. However, no person has been arrested in the cases.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hhzf8s/article32937401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SNSHRIVASTAVA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/others-cannot-usurp-role-of-police-and-create-a-false-narrative-says-delhi-police-commissioner/article32937402.ece

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal threw open the much-awaited flyovers at Seelampur and Shastri park to the public in northeast Delhi on Saturday and said the AAP government is ensuring the best facilities for the people of the city by saving money in every project.

He said the distance between Inter-State Bus Terminus and U.P. border can now be covered in 10 minutes. Addressing a gathering at an event in New Delhi, Mr. Kejriwal said his government has saved ₹53 crore on the project by building the two flyovers at a cost of ₹250 crore against the sanctioned amount of ₹303 crore.

The Chief Minister claimed that when a hospital is built in any part of the country, there is an expenditure of ₹1.5 crore per bed but the AAP government has been saving money in every project. “In Delhi, we built an air-conditioned hospital having all facilities with an expenditure of only ₹30 lakh per bed... Since the AAP has come to power, we have been saving money in every project. Through the saved money, we have made medicines, water and electricity free, and are also building the best schools. We are providing facilities to the people of Delhi by saving money in projects,” he said.

The Chief Minister said the people living in the area will benefit from the new flyovers. No previous governments or any former Chief Ministers paid heed to the issues of the people of East Delhi and they were given “stepmotherly treatment”, Mr. Kejriwal alleged.

PWD Minister Satyendar Jain said the government will construct children’s parks under the flyovers. The government said that Shastri park flyover has six lanes. The construction of the new flyover will bring relief to around 1.5 lakh vehicles which seem to travel through the route daily, a statement stated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/8x25rz/article32936558.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24IN-KEJRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-cm-kejriwal-throws-open-seelampur-shastri-park-flyovers-to-public/article32936559.ece

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine should be made available throughout the country for free, saying all the people were troubled by the coronavirus.

A debate has started on whether the COVID-19 vaccine, which is yet to materialise, should be made available to people for free, with the Bharatiya Janata Party promising free doses of the vaccine in its manifesto for the Bihar polls.

“The whole country should get free COVID-19 vaccine. It is a right of the entire country. All the people are troubled by the coronavirus, so the vaccine should be free for the country,” Mr. Kejriwal told reporters after inaugurating two flyovers in northeast Delhi.

168,2020/10/24,Delhi riots: Delhi HC grants bail to SIM card salesman charged under UAPA,"The Delhi High Court has granted bail to a SIM card salesman, arrested under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with the north-east Delhi riots, noting that the police has failed to give any evidence that he was directly involved in the protest against Citizenship Amendment Act.

“It is not the case of the investigating agency that the petitioner (Faizan Khan) was part of any such WhatsApp groups which were made to coordinate/organize protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019,” Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said.

The judge further pointed out that there was no allegation against Mr Khan that he engaged in any form of terror funding or such other ancillary activity.

“For invoking the UAPA against the present petitioner, it is the duty of the investigating agency to demonstrate that the petitioner had “actual knowledge” that the said SIM card would be used for organizing the protests,” the high court said.

“There is no proof on record such as CCTV footage, video or chats of petitioner with any of the group except the allegation that he provided SIM on fake ID in December 2019 and taken a small amount of ₹200/- for the same,” Justice Kait said.

It is not the case of the prosecution that he provided many SIMs and continued to do the same. It is also not the case of prosecution that he was part of any chat-group or part of any group who conspired to commit offence as alleged in the present case, the judge highlighted.

The high court rejected the argument made by additional solicitor general S.V. Raju that since inception Mr Khan was well aware about the conspiracy of riots. Thr ASG had claimed that the SIM Card supplied by Mr Khan was further used to managed the various sites and to mobilize the Muslim people of area on the protest sites which further led to Chakka Jaam and riots in various protest site in Delhi.

The judge also took note of the fact that Mr Khan voluntarily appeared before the agency for questioning and did not evade or flee between the periods of registration of the FIR on March 06 and the date of his arrest July 29.

“This is material fact shows that the petitioner has fully cooperated with the probe and had made himself available as and when directed by the investigating agency,” the high court said.

During interrogation Mr Khan disclosed that Jamia Mailia Islamia University student Asif Iqbal Tanha visited the shop and had demanded the SIM card on a fake ID. Mr Khan activated the SIM Card on using ID of one Abdul Jabbar with the live photograph of one Gaurav Kumar Diwakar, working as a salesman in the shop.

Senior advocate Salman Khushid, appearing on behalf Mr Khan, submitted that the investigating agency has misapplied and wrongly invoked UAPA against his client. “The invocation of the UAPA, 1967 vis-à-vis the petitioner is a gross abuse by the investigating agency to deprive the petitioner of his personal liberty,” Mr Khurshid had argued.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-riots-delhi-hc-grants-bail-to-sim-card-salesman-charged-under-uapa/article32936210.ece
169,2020/10/24,‘Ensure Khalid is given same treatment as other inmates’,"Delhi courts tells Tihar jail to give him books, warm clothes

A Delhi court on Friday asked Tihar jail authorities to ensure that former JNU student Umar Khalid, who was arrested in connection with north-east Delhi riots, is given the same treatment as other inmates and allowed to move outside his cell.

Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat also asked Tihar jail authorities to allow Mr. Khalid to get books and warm clothes in view of the onset of winter.

Mr. Khalid, on Thursday, during a videoconferencing hearing on an application moved by the Special Public Prosecutor for a 30-day extension of his judicial custody, claimed that he was not allowed to step out of his cell akin to “solitary confinement”.

‘Security reasons’

Tihar jail Superintendent, who appeared before the court through videoconferencing, said Mr. Khalid has been provided all the facilities as other inmates and he is taken out of his cell on a regular basis. The Superintendent said the decision to restrict his movement was taken in view of security reasons.

“I understand that there is a safety and security issue, but that cannot become the norm. The norm is to keep him out,” Judge Rawat said.

The Jail Superintendent, in his reply, also stated that “the cell where the inmate [Khalid] is kept is located at such a place from where more than half of the ward movement is visible”.

Reacting to this, Judge Rawat said, “What do you want to say from this? This is a very strange and bizarre thing to say.”

During the hearing, Mr. Khalid said that after the issue was brought to the attention of the court on Thursday, the Jail Superintendent came to meet him and took him out of his cell. “When an order was passed by Additional Superintendent Pradeep Sharma that I will not be allowed to go out at all, the condition became very acute for me over the last few days,” Mr. Khalid said.

Judge Rawat also asked Mr. Khalid to cooperate with the jail authorities in view of the security risk being posed to him.

The Jail Superintendent said that they have around 50-60 inmates coming in on a daily basis whose credentials are unknown to them. In view of this, Mr. Khalid’s security aspect is to be considered, he said.

The court also extended till November 20 the judicial custody of Mr. Khalid and JNU student Sharjeel Imam in the case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ensure-khalid-is-given-same-treatment-as-other-inmates/article32933722.ece
170,2020/10/24,Call to restart non-COVID treatment,"The resident doctors of Lok Nayak Hospital, the largest Delhi government-run hospital, on Friday reiterated their demand to restart non-COVID-19 treatment at the hospital.

“Just making building in the name of hospital will not suffice for public health if trained doctors are not available. Its high time to focus on training of doctors and re-initiate Non-COVID services at LNH [sic],” the RDA of the hospital tweeted.

The RDA, in a letter to the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the hospital used to attend more than 9,000 OPD patients and more than 200 surgical procedures every day before the COVID-19 pandemic and all these people are suffering as Lok Nayak Hospital is an exclusive COVID-19 facility now.

“The first-year postgraduate students have been deployed in the periphery by the orders of Chief Secretary, Health, and now they are doing clerical job at peripheral district centres for more than six months where there is no scope of learning,” the letter said.

The RDA also said that as the hospital is treating only COVID-19 patients now, many senior resident doctors left their posts as they were not gaining knowledge and clinical skills and new residents are hesitant to join.

“This has left many seats vacant in various departments,” the letter stated, adding that two of the most affected departments are working with half the strength with 42 seats vacant in the Department of Anesthesia and 10 in the Department of Medicine.

In a shocking incident, a Delhi Police Constable was allegedly abducted by a bus driver and his staff after he intercepted them and boarded the vehicle for checking. Two persons have been arrested, police said.

A senior police officer said that the incident took place on Wednesday night when Constable Sachin, posted at Kashmere Gate police station, was patrolling in the area and heard some women passengers shouting for help from inside the bus. He then asked the bus driver to stop.

When the bus stopped, two staff members of the bus came outside and started arguing with the Constable. Sensing something suspicious, he boarded the bus but the bus attendants and the co-drivers overpowered him. “They locked him inside, made him sit on the floor and sped away. They also snatched his service pistol and mobile phones. When he resisted, they manhandled him. When a few passengers on board objected to this, they were also threatened,” the officer said, adding that the accused left him at Makkhanpur area near Firozabad in Uttar Pradesh. The Constable then reached Makkhanpur police station and informed his senior officers.

During investigation, police found that the offending bus was being operated by one Munna alias Rajeev Chaurasia and his son Ankit. The bus was then traced to Machhand village in Madhya Pradesh after which a raid was conducted at the accused’s residence and both were arrested.

172,2020/10/24,"Centre considering ‘action’ in DU power struggle, but VC not removed yet","VC Tyagi’s Registrar appointee writes to Ministry after Centre backs Pro VC Joshi, says decisions taken as per varsity statutes

The Centre is considering “strict action” against the Delhi University Vice Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi, but has not yet moved to seek his permanent removal, according to senior Education Ministry officials.

DU has been grappling with a power tussle between the senior most functionaries appointing different officials as Registrars of the varsity. On Thursday, the Ministry had written to the university, intervening in the spat over P.C. Jha’s appointment as Registrar by Prof. Tyagi, who is currently on medical leave.

The Ministry’s letter had backed Pro Vice Chancellor P.C. Joshi, who has been the acting VC, and his appointee Vikas Gupta as Registrar instead.

The Ministry stated that Prof Tyagi’s orders issued during his absence were not valid, and added that, “In future, if the Vice Chancellor wants to join the office, proper medical fitness certificate issued by the competent authority who treated him may be obtained.”

A meeting was held in the Ministry on Friday, to discuss the ongoing power struggle and other administrative issues at DU.

Following the meeting, when asked what further action the Ministry was taking, officials said that “strict action is being contemplated”. However, when asked whether Prof. Tyagi was being removed, officials said this was “not yet” being done.

Earlier on Friday, Prof. Jha wrote to the Education Ministry stating that appointments made by Prof. Tyagi were in compliance with relevant ordinances of the varsity.

In his letter to the Ministry, Prof. Jha wrote, “It is informed that Professor P.C. Jha, in addition to his responsibilities as Director of South Campus, is acting as Registrar of University of Delhi, as an interim arrangement. It is also informed that Dr. Geeta Bhatt has been appointed as Pro Vice Chancellor in place of Professor P.C. Joshi.”

“VC Yogesh K. Tyagi has taken decisions in due compliance with the Act, Statutes and Ordinances of Delhi University,” the letter read.

The VC’s office also complained that Prof. Tyagi’s appointee Dr. Bhatt was unable to access the official email address of the Pro Vice Chancellor as the password had been changed on Thursday night.

A Friday email from an official in the VC’s office to the director of the University Computer Centre demanded that the password be conveyed to Dr. Bhatt and that the “fake press release” put on the DU website in the name of the Registrar be removed.

That release was issued late on Thursday night by Registrar Gupta, whose appointment Prof. Joshi had notified earlier in the day. “It is hereby clarified that professor PC Joshi, Pro VC will act as VC and is the only competent authority to approve or issue orders as per the provisions of the [DU] Act, statutes and ordinances of the university. Any notification or orders issued without the due approval of P.C. Joshi are null and void,” the communication read.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/centre-considering-action-in-du-power-struggle-but-vc-not-removed-yet/article32933608.ece
173,2020/10/24,‘Reply to plea on quashing of notice for UPSC exam’,"Not enough seats reserved for people with disabilities: HC

The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Centre to respond to a petition seeking quashing of notice for this year’s civil service examination on the ground that not enough seats have been reserved for those with visual and multiple disabilities.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan also issued notice to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on the allegation made by a disability rights organisation that seats have not been reserved in accordance with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act of 2016.

Evara Foundation, in its plea filed through advocate Kamlesh Kumar Misra, also sought to stay the declaration of the results for the preliminary examination.

The court declined the plea, saying the UPSC will be asked to recompute its result if the final order goes in their favour.

The High Court is also seized of a similar petition by another organisation, Sambhavana, a registered society of the disabled for the disabled, claiming that UPSC has reserved only 24 vacancies for persons with disabilities out of a total of 796 “expected approximate vacancies”.

Sambhavana said this was below the 4% mandatory reservation under Section 34 of the RPWD Act.

On Friday, the court declined Sambhavana’s plea seeking early hearing of its petition noting that the civil services main examination was scheduled to commence from January and the next date of hearing in their case was in November.

Evara Foundation, in its plea, has contended that due to inadequate number of advertised vacancies for visually impaired and those with multiple disabilities, fewer candidates belonging to these two categories will qualify for the main examination.

It also contended that the number of seats reserved for visually impaired, people who are deaf and hard of hearing or with locomotor disabilities is not in accordance with the RPWD Act.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/reply-to-plea-on-quashing-of-notice-for-upsc-exam/article32933599.ece

Telangana State Human Rights Commission has restrained Northern Power Distribution Company of Telangana Ltd (TSNPDCL) from disconnecting 251 low-tension (LT) connections in the residential quarters of Mancherial Cement Company Private Ltd as also connection to Mulkalla pump house that supplies water to the quarters till November 17.

The Commission has also restrained the cement company from evicting its 251 employees and their families from the company quarters till that date.

In his interim order on a complaint filed by Akhil Sai Mallaram, an employee of the cement company and an electricity consumer, Member (Judicial) of the Commission Ananda Rao Nadipally held that prevailing COVID-19 pandemic situation and the current festival season are ample ground, as submitted by the petitioner, to retrain the power utility from disconnecting the connections and the cement company from vacating its employees from residential quarters. The petition was heard by the Commission on Friday and the interim order was issued on Saturday.

The petitioner submitted to Commission that in June 2019 TSNPDCL had disconnected high-tension power connection to the Mulkalla pump house, the only source that supplies water to the residential quarters, due to non-payment of energy consumption charges. In August 2019, the power utility had sanctioned new domestic LT connections to all the 251 residential quarters of the cement company and since then the employees have been paying bills regularly including the bill amount of Mulkalla pump house. However, the power utility had again issued notice to the cement company to clear the HT connection dues or else it would disconnect the domestic connections to 251 quarters after October 23. Based on the power utility’s notice the company has asked its employees occupying the 251 quarters to vacate the quarters since there would be no power supply.

The Commission has directed the divisional officer of the power utility and the cement company to file their reports by November 17 stating that it is necessary to hear the version of the power utility and two of its offices as also the cement company to decide whether the power utility is entitled to disconnect power to 251 quarters in spite of payment of bills regularly and how the company asks its employees to vacate quarters without providing alternative accommodation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/shrc-restrains-power-utility-from-stopping-power-to-251-quarters/article32937890.ece
182,2020/10/24,‘Hyderabad flood manageable with the help of technology’,"State Planning Board holds meeting with engineers, experts

Engineers and experts in subjects linked to flooding have opined that linking all the 185 tanks in and around Hyderabad with modern technology to divert flow of water during deluge coupled with measures to control flood (rainwater) flow by restoring ‘nalas’ and removing encroachments would help prevent flooding and inundation.

Vice-chairman of State Planning Board, B. Vinod Kumar held a meeting with the engineers of Institution of Engineers-India (IEI) and other experts here on Saturday on “how to overcome flooding and inundation in the event of deluge in Hyderabad and alternative ways out”. The engineers and experts had detailed discussions on the issue before meeting Mr. Vinod Kumar.

According to officials, the engineers and experts explained to Mr. Vinod Kumar that the unprecedented rains recurred in the city after a gap of over 100 years. The death toll in the 1908 floods in Musi was over 17,000 when the population of the city was only about 5 lakh.

The recent flooding, however, had caused loss of life on a lower scale although the population had gone beyond 1 crore.

Experts were of the opinion that 45% of the inundated/flooded colonies during the recent heavy rains experienced the impact of deluge for the first time and another 35% for the second or third time. The remaining 10% residential areas had, however, experienced, flood several times after 1908.

Further, they were of the opinion that surplus flood water from Osmansagar (Gandipet) and Himayatsagar could be linked to the command area of Musi downstream by removing the encroachments along the river course so as to ensure obstruction-free flow within the course. Besides, the drainage and sewage water that is let into Musi should be treated on a daily basis before allowing it flow out of the city.

The State Planning Board along with the engineers of IEI and experts in dealing with floods and irrigation would submit a comprehensive report on preventing recurrence of flooding of Hyderabad to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao soon.

For the first time in the history of Civil Services preliminary exam, the results were declared in record 20 days though the general time taken is 45 days.

The minimum qualifying mark for all the categories seems to have been higher than last year,” said V. Gopala Krishna of Brain Tree.

Notification

The examination was notified in February 2020 for 796 vacancies and was conducted on October 4 by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC ), a few months behind schedule due to the prevailing pandemic.

The Main examination for those who qualified in the prelims will be held in all the capital cities of the country from January 8 for a period of five days. The results of the Main examination are expected by the end of March.

Minister for Agriculture and Marketing Singireddy Niranjan Reddy, in a statement issued on Saturday, said arrangements have been made to sell the subsidised onion at ₹35 a kg to consumers in Rythu Bazars. Every consumer can get a maximum of 2 kg of subsidised onions by showing their identity cards such as Aadhaar, voter ID and others at the counter.

The minister said the government intervention would not only provide the pricey commodity at a subsidised rate to consumers, but would also help control the onion prices in the open market – at least prevent it from shooting up further. Stating that the onion crop has been damaged badly in the recent rains, the minister said the Centre had also banned hoarding of the commodity and fixed limits of stocking by the retail and wholesale vendors.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/subsidised-onion-to-be-sold-in-rythu-bazars-at-35-per-kg/article32937868.ece

187,2020/10/24,Few takers for RTC buses,"Less than half of the 3,000 special buses deployed pressed into service

Telangana State Road Transport Corporation’s bus stations and stops buzzed with activity as thousands from the city headed for their hometowns across the State ahead of Dasara.

As a part of Dasara bus services, the transport juggernaut chalked up plans of deploying around 3,000 special buses to various destinations including Warangal, Adilabad, Khammam and Mahbubnagar, among several others. But, as on Saturday, less than half of those were pressed into service.

“Last year, due to the strike called by trade unions, the operations were affected. The number of buses and passengers were reduced. But in 2018, the number of services as well as the occupancy was much higher. I think it is because of COVID-19 pandemic that the number of passengers this year is lower than that of 2018. Reduced spending capacity due to the pandemic could be another factor,” said a TSRTC staff member.

On the one hand, it is from the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station that buses towards destinations in erstwhile composite districts such as Mahbubnagar and Khammam move. On the other, the Jubilee Bus Station caters to passengers travelling to destinations in north Telangana such as those in Adilabad, Nizamabad, Karimnagar and Medak. The Uppal bus stop saw movement of buses towards Warangal and Thorrur. Buses beginning their journey from L.B. Nagar moved towards Nalgonda district and stopped en route.

Those familiar with operations said a large number of passenger movement is seen towards north Telangana.

While inter-district services in the State were operational, inter-State services between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh continued to remain suspended. Both State transport undertakings could not come to an agreement on the number of kilometres and the number of buses they should clock. The situation forced several passengers to travel by private transport and shared cabs.

Several passengers appeared to ignore COVID-19 precautions such as wearing masks at the bus stations and stops, including at the one in Uppal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/few-takers-for-rtc-buses/article32937754.ece
188,2020/10/24,Shoppers ignore call of the mall,"Very few throng restaurants, vehicle showrooms too

It was low-key Dasara shopping in Hyderabad on Saturday as very few people thronged malls, restaurants and vehicle showrooms. The few exceptions were the budget retailers who offered big discounts on their stocks, apart from jewellery showrooms.

At an upscale mall near Botanical Gardens, very few shoppers were seen. The only place that had some buzz was the dining area.

Dasara is also the festival during which Telugu movie makers schedule their release to cash in on the holiday crowd. This year, the releases were limited to OTT platforms due to COVID-19 restrictions. Only the low-profile Colour Photo began streaming on OTT platforms.

Missing was the festive buzz at vehicle showrooms which see a spike in sales during Dasara due to religious sentiments.

The only whiff about the festival were the heaps of marigold flowers being sold in city corners and thoroughfares, and the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation buses bedecked with flowers and buntings to mark Ayudha Puja.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/shoppers-ignore-call-of-the-mall/article32937748.ece

190,2020/10/24,Rush missing from railway station on Dasara eve,"Only passengers with confirmed tickets allowed inside the Secunderabad station

The usual hustle and bustle at Secunderabad railway station on the eve of Dasara was sorely missing this year. Entry into the railway station was restricted to people carrying a ticket. While there was a constant flow of passengers, the premises outside the station wore a deserted look and the otherwise busy parking lot had sparse vehicles.

In previous years, people in Hyderabad used to head to their native places in the run-up to Dasara, due to which all means of transport overflowed with passengers. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has completely changed all that.

Since entry into the station was restricted only to passengers, family members and friends zipped away after dropping them off at the entrances. Platform tickets too were not sold. So, the option of sending off family or friends till the train departed was not available.

“We opened the parking lot after over seven months. But not many people are parking their vehicles here,” said a man who issues parking tickets near the main entrance of Secunderabad Railway Station. The parking lot at the second entrance of the railway station is closed.

Earlier, South Central Railway officials had said that no passenger should come to the stations without a confirmed ticket. Authorities thoroughly checked whether passengers wore masks and maintained physical distancing.

Holding bags and wearing backpacks, people showed either a hard copy or digital copy of their tickets to gain entry. This, after sanitising their hands. Staff holding the sanitisers chased passengers, who were in hurry, to clean their hands.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/g8lys4/article32937730.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy25SCR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rush-missing-from-railway-station-on-dasara-eve/article32937722.ece
191,2020/10/24,‘Dream of Kaleshwaram water realised’,"Contest is between free power to bores and charging the same: Harish

Finance Minister T Harish Rao said that Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has realised the dream of Kaleshwaram water and now people are getting irrigation for their fields.

Participating in election campaign in several villages held in Dubbak constituency on Saturday, Mr. Harish Rao said that the contest was between free power to borewells being offered by the TRS and power charges to borewells by fixing meters being proposed by the BJP. He said that during Congress regime motors had burnt due to irregular power.

“We have presented the development in five years that was not made possible in six decades by both Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party. We have offered drinking water through Mission Bhagiratha and now women need not wait at street taps. Godavari water is being brought here from 300 km and lifted to a height of 500 metres. We are offering Kalyana Lakshmi for every eligible and eighteen families have benefited in your villages,” said Mr. Harish Rao while addressing a gathering at Govindapur, Madhira and Posanpally villages.

Referring to pensions being extended to beedi farmers, the Minister questioned why the same was not extended in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states. He said farmers had been forced to pay ₹10,000 if the motor burnt and ₹30,000 if transformer burnt but the situation was changed after Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) came to power.

Mr. Harish Rao said that BJP village committees were leaving the party and joining the TRS and five committees in Daultabad mandal had already joined the party.

192,2020/10/24,Dubbak poll forced CM’s hand: Uttam,"‘But for it, decision on MSP for maize would not have come’

The government’s decision to buy maize at a support price of ₹1,850 per quintal and releasing dearness allowance for employees is a victory of Dubbak people and without these elections no such decision would have come, said TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy.

This was the power of farmers, employees and the support extended by the Congress to their just demands. But for these elections such a decision would not have come and if one by-poll can force Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to his knees imagine a victory for Congress in Dubbak can force him to fulfil all his electoral promises, Mr. Reddy argued.

He said the Chief Minister who ridiculed government employees comparing them with dog’s tail for demanding PRC and DA had suddenly announced DA fearing the outcome of Dubbak by-poll. TRS should be defeated in Dubbak to keep the autocratic rule of KCR in check.

Mr. Reddy said Dubbak results would bring a lot of changes in the State politics and the KCR government would be forced to fulfil several promises it made. Employees were yet to get a new PRC and two DAs, crop loan waiver remained unimplemented and farmers who lost their crops due to natural calamities did not get any compensation, he said adding that the government would be forced to procure all crops at MSP.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/dubbak-poll-forced-cms-hand-uttam/article32937586.ece

195,2020/10/24,Central team’s visit eyewash: Congress,"How can large-scale damage be assessed in two days, ask party leaders ’

Stressing that the Central team led by Union Home Ministry's Joint Secretary Praveen Vashista visiting the city to assess the flood damage had made a mockery of lakhs of people who suffered, the Telangana Congress wondered how could visiting officials study such large-scale loss caused by rains across the State in just two days.

Addressing a press conference here former MPs Madhu Yashki Goud and Anjan Kumar Yadav, AICC national spokesperson Sravan Dasoju and Youth Congress president Anil Kumar Yadav said visit was eyewash. “How can they assess damage caused on such a large scale in just two days? And how can they arrive at the real picture, by depending on Telangana government officials, who failed to deliver their duty when rains and floods struck people?"" asked Mr Dasoju Sravan.

“Instead of following the itinerary planned by Telangana government officials and speaking to those whom officials had shepherded, the Central team should have made a surprise visit and interacted with general public, opposition parties, civic society groups to get a real picture,” he said.

Mr. Sravan alleged that in many places officials had misled the Central team to hide their incompetence. “For instance GHMC East Zone Commissioner Upender Reddy, and South Zone Commissioner Samrat Ashok stage-managed and ensured that the Central team got positive feedback from people,” he claimed.

The Congress was also angry that the Central team did not give an appointment to them and said instead team members sat in Taj Krishna Hotel and prepared reports, according to the briefing given by Telangana officials.

Mr. Sravan said Mr K. Chandrasekhar Rao was probably the only Chief Minister in the entire history, who did not visit the flood-hit areas and did not bother to console those, who lost lives due to rains.

The Congress leaders alleged that the TRS leaders were now trying to gain political mileage by distributing money offered by the government as compensation, as being given by them personally. “Why is the government not offering Rs 10,000 cheques,” they asked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/8viiaf/article32937524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25HYHAKIMPETKUNTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/central-teams-visit-eyewash-congress/article32937525.ece
196,2020/10/24,OTP scheme for LPG refills from November 1,"Come November 1, domestic liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) customers of public sector oil marketing companies in six smart cities of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana will need to share a one-time password (OTP) while taking delivery of the refills.

Warangal and Karimnagar in Telangana and Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Kakinada and Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh are the cities where the OTP-based delivery authentication code (DAC) to ensure the refill reaches the intended customer will be rolled out.

The six cities form part of 100 smart cities across the country where the oil companies are getting ready to launch the project next month.

Besides the smart cities, the project is likely to be extended to a few more cities, Hyderabad being one of them, sources in the companies said.

Hyderabad is not part of the list, but the project of customer authenticating refill deliveries is already under way in the city, said R.Sravan S.Rao, Executive Director and State Head of Indian Oil Corporation for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

The fundamental idea behind the OTP scheme is to reach the cylinder to the intended customer and push forward the digitisation process.

The DAC scheme will replace the existing process of the delivery boy getting the customer’s signature on the receipt while delivering the refill and submitting it later at the LPG distributor office. In the new scheme, an one-time password received on the registered mobile phone has to be shared by the customers at the time of taking delivery.

Sources in Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) said the emphasis of government is every LPG customer should be clearly identified. Thus, those using connection registered in someone else name will find it difficult with the new scheme.

Telangana LPG Distributor’s Association General Secretary K. Jagan Mohan Reddy said an official communication was yet awaited.

He said there are bound to be some teething issues, especially if the family has only one mobile phone and that is with someone who is at work elsewhere.

Mr.Rao said customers will not be inconvenienced and refill delivered if there are issues such as those pertaining to mobile connectivity.

In such cases, the delivery boy has to call the distributorship and ask them to exercise the override option that hitherto he did.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/otp-scheme-for-lpg-refills-from-november-1/article32937520.ece
197,2020/10/24,2 Srisailam units to resume generation,"Trial run of the restored units on to check various parameters

About two months after a fire brought power generation to a halt in the 6×150 megawatt underground Srisailam Left Bank Hydro Electric Station (SLBHES) near Eegalapenta in Nagarkurnool district, two of its units are set to resume generation formally on Monday.

After experimental run to check various parameters of the two units on Thursday and Friday by running them for short duration in phases, trial run of Units 1 and 2 commenced on Saturday morning. During the experimental run, the two units were also synchronised with the grid on Friday evening. According to officials of the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation (TS-Genco), the trial run continued throughout the day and is likely to continue further.

“But for the COVID-19 impact, the two units would have been revived last month itself. Several engineers and employees of the prestigious underground power station with the facility of reversible pump mode of generation and Director (Hydel) of Genco who was supervising the work too have contracted COVID-19 during the restoration/repair works delaying the completion by about three weeks”, a senior executive of the Genco told The Hindu on Saturday.

They were able to bring back the two units to generation stage with spares sourced locally (within the country) and with local experts. “We are happy to revive the two units at least at the fag end of the flood season. It has been quite challenging but our engineers and employees have proved their mettle one more time”, the senior officials stated.

With good inflows continue to reach the Srisailam reservoir from Bhima-Krishna-Tungabhadra rivers, the TS-Genco officials are hopeful of making up at least some lost ground in generation of the low-cost energy. Last year, generation in the Srisailam LBHES during September and October months was about 988 million units (MU).

In 20 days of generation possible this August, nearly 400 MU energy was generated till the fire broke out on August 20 night bringing the facility to a grinding halt., officials explained. As part of the revival of the Srisailam LBHES, the Genco authorities have also replaced the outdated supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system there with a modern facility.

Minister for Energy G. Jagadish Reddy, Chairman and Managing Director of TS-Genco D. Prabhakar Rao and other senior officials of the Energy department and power utilities are expected re-launch the two units of Srisailam LBHES officially on October 26. Genco officials plan complete restoration of three more units over the next three months, irrespective of possibility of generation, and the remaining one unit before the flood season next year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2-srisailam-units-to-resume-generation/article32937511.ece

201,2020/10/24,Durga puja loses sheen this year,"COVID pandemic forces organisers to tone down celebrations

Friday marked the Saptami of the nine-day Durga Puja. But the sound of dhaak (drum), the smell of bhog (food), the fragrance of dhuno (frankincense) were just a memory for countless families during the festival this year in Hyderabad.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced festival organisers to tone down the celebrations and adopt online streaming option to keep the faithful in good humour. At the Hyderabad Bangalee Samity puja tent near Indira Park, the sign on the road is direct: Entrance for members only.

“This is a break in tradition after 55 years for us,” says Subrata Ganguly of Bangiye Sanskritik Sangha at the low-key celebration at Mahbub College in Secunderabad area. “We used to get 8,000 people per day, and for cultural events the numbers topped 15,000, but now we are allowing only 50 members with social distancing as per police guidelines. But hundreds of people are logging in to see the live-streamed programmes of pujo,” said Mr. Ganguly.

Organisers have tried to shift the drama online, with an important caveat: Dear Devotees, keeping in mind the COVID-19 guidelines this year, there shall be no distribution of prasad or bhog. Entry restricted and limited puja organisers only.

202,2020/10/24,Complete disbursal of relief amount on war-footing: KCR,"Southern Discom Chairman and Managing Director apprises Chief Minister of extensive damage to power T&D network

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has instructed officials to complete the relief and rehabilitation measures in Hyderabad on a war-footing.

“Due to heavy rains and floods, water entered into houses in several localities and damaged everything, including essential commodities and clothes. People were not in a position to even cook their meal. To help overcome such a helpless situation, the government has decided to extend immediate financial assistance of ₹10,000 each to affected families,” the Chief Minister said at a review meeting held here on Friday.

According to officials in the Chief Minister’s Office, directions have been issued to ensure that at least one-lakh families get the assistance every day so that they could get some relief before the Dasara festival. “If the poor get the assistance before the festival, it will be good for them,” the Chief Minister said and asked the officials to carry out the exercise actively. Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, Principal Secretary (MA&UD) Arvind Kumar, GHMC Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar, MA&UD Commissioner Satyanarayana Reddy, Water Works ED Satyanarayana, SPDCL CMD G. Raghuma Reddy and others attended the review meeting.

Informing the damage caused to power supply network in the city, Chairman and Managing Director of Southern Discom MR. Raghuma Reddy said at the meeting: Heavy rains and floods have caused extensive damage to the transmission and distribution network in the city, including 33/11 KV sub-stations at 15 locations, and 11 KV feeders at 1,080 places. All of them have been repaired and restored.

Besides, Mr. Reddy stated that a total of 1,215 distribution transformers were also damaged in Greater Hyderabad and all but 8 have already been restored. Supply could not be restored to consumers under 8 transformers as they continue to remain in flood water. Flood to Musi river has also damaged 1,145 transformers supplying power to agriculture connections in the rural areas. Of them, 386 have been repaired already to restore power supply and another 759 were yet to be repaired. Of the transformers yet to be repaired, 586 were submerged/washed away in the flood waters of Musi in Nalgonda, Yadadri-Bhongir and Suryapet districts, he explained.

Further, he explained that all the 1,299 electric poles damaged in Greater Hyderabad have been restored already. Flood to Musi has damaged 5,335 poles in the rural areas, and of them - 3,249 were replaced/restored and the work was going on the remaining 2,086 poles.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/complete-disbursal-of-relief-amount-on-war-footing-kcr/article32933744.ece

204,2020/10/24,GHMC reduces Hakimpet Kunta into dumping yard,"Shrinkage of the lake is also being blamed for flooding in Nadeem Colony

As city was battling rains and floods in other parts of the city over the fortnight, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation turned the Hakimpet Kunta between Filmnagar and Shaikpet into a dumping site for waste.

“We are dumping only temporarily. We will move it to the processing site later,” said an assistant engineer of GHMC when asked about the dumping activity.

While the dumping activity was ongoing, water was flowing out from the other side of the lake forcing residents of Sabza Colony and other areas to build their own temporary embankments to keep the water out. It was the continuous water mixed with sewage from this lake that added to the flood agony of residents of Toli Chowki.

Waste, flood debris, sand and waste that had accumulated in Toli Chowki area was brought in vehicles with unmarked/masked numbers and dumped at the site. “We are just following orders. We cannot do anything,” said a vehicle driver who brought the debris from Galaxy Cinema in Toli Chowki, when asked about the dumping into the lake.

The walled railing on the south-eastern side of the lake has been torn down to facilitate dumping.

The area is still known as Shaikpet Nala and was part of the lake and channel network to prevent flooding in the area. “The reduction in carrying capacity of these lakes by dumping is one of the main reasons for frequent flooding in that area,” says Lubna Sarwath of Save Our Urban Lakes.

The shrinkage of the lake is also being blamed for the flooding in Nadeem Colony. “The waters are not receding in our area as the water from all the upstream lakes are still flowing here. If the Hakimpet Kunta was not shrunk, the flood would not have lasted so long,” said Dastgir, a resident of Nadeem Colony. Hakimpet Kunta (id number 3903) is among the lakes identified for conservation by Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority in 2014.

But despite the official action, which included notification of Full Tank Level boundaries and revenue survey numbers, nothing seems to have changed on the ground for protection of the lake.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/i936um/article32933738.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY24HAKIMPETKUNTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ghmc-reduces-hakimpet-kunta-into-dumping-yard/article32933739.ece
205,2020/10/24,The revenge of the lakes in Hyderabad,"Over the past week, floods in Hyderabad have killed 33 people and destroyed property. Swathi Vadlamudi and Syed Mohammed report on how a burgeoning population and rapid infrastructural development have put tremendous pressure on the water bodies of the city, reducing their area, quantity and quality

Mohammed Abdul Quddus Qureshi’s body was found at the Nagole sewage treatment plant along the Musi river, 13 km from his home in Alinagar, even as the steady downpour in Hyderabad continued. His decaying body had floated across three police commissionerate jurisdictions before being fished out. He was laid to rest in a cemetery in Chanchalguda, a neighbourhood in the Old City, near the fresh graves of four of his family members. They were also swept away by the waters of the overflowing Palle Cheruvu lake, part of the Umda Sagar lake basin. Of the nine members of the family who were swept away in the deluge of October 13, only one, Mohammed Abdul Taher Qureshi, survived; three remain missing. The family’s loss accounts for a chunk of the 33 deaths recorded in Hyderabad.

Taher Qureshi was trying to move the eight members of the single-storey house across the rising waters to safety in his brother’s three-storey building. But the torrent was so strong that it was as if the chabutra, on which they were standing, dissolved in it like salt.

“I heard a wall collapse and in no time, water came in with full force onto the road and consumed the ground floor of the building. I buried two grandchildren and two daughters-in-law. My brother’s body, which was found in Nagole, had decomposed. The bodies of three others have still not been found,” says Abdul, his voice quivering.

A short distance from Alinagar, along National Highway 44, the floodwater from the Appa Cheruvu lake close by, devoured siblings Tanima and Amer, and a cousin, Taher. Their bodies were found a day later. The body of Ayaan, an eight-year-old boy, was also retrieved. The family of four along with their cousin were at home when the water swirled over the wall, sweeping away the house and its inhabitants.

In a separate incident, also on NH 44, Moaawia Youssef, a Sudanese student, who was on his way to the airport along with his cab driver, was last seen on October 14. While the cab driver was eventually traced, the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport Police confirmed that the National Disaster Response Force teams have thus far been unsuccessful in tracing the student.

Unprecedented flooding

The downpour had more devastation in store, and the restive Gurram Cheruvu lake, also part of the Umda Sagar lake basin, served as its vassal. On October 18, its bund that serves as a road connecting Barkas (a corruption of the word ‘barracks’) to Balapur succumbed to water pressure. What followed was an unprecedented flooding of neighbourhoods south of the bund.

Ravi, a caretaker of a dairy farm, recalls the roar with which the water broke the bund. “Around 1 a.m., it rose up to 12 feet, broke our walls and took away cash and furniture. I rushed to save my mother. It is a miracle that we — our four buffaloes, 15 sheep and four horses — are safe. The water then went towards Hafiz Baba Nagar,” he says.

Editorial | Dealing with a deluge: On Hyderabad floods

The scenes from Hafiz Baba Nagar are telling of the loss and devastation. Dozens here are left with nothing but the damp clothes on their backs. “The water smashed the wall of my house, and portions of the roof collapsed. The washing machine, fridge, and our clothes were all swept away. I will have to rebuild my life from scratch,” says Mohammed Salman, an optical fibre cable trencher, and the owner of a home in B Block.

On October 14, after night-long rain, the daily rainfall recorded at the weather monitoring station of the India Meteorological Department at Begumpet was 19.2 cm. It was the second highest in the recorded history of rainfall in a single day at this station since 1891. The water drowned the roads and inundated homes worth crores of rupees in upmarket localities such as Manikonda, Gachibowli, Rajendranagar and Madhapur on the western part of the city, the hub of the IT industry.

On the other hand, data from the automatic weather stations, installed by the Telangana State Development Planning Society, showed the highest for the day at 33 cm, recorded at the Singapore Township in Pocharam, in the eastern part of the city. A week later, the Irrigation Department Principal Secretary, Rajat Kumar, noted that 185 lakes overflowed on account of the rains. Of these, Appa Cheruvu, Palle Cheruvu and Gurram Cheruvu were described as those that breached.

The sisterhood of lakes

In Telangana’s natural terrain, lakes exist in sororities. The State’s undulating topography allowed the existence of a reported one lakh chain-linked lakes/ponds, locally known as Kuntas and Cheruvus, in Hyderabad and its peripheries in the pre-independence era. Surplus water from each lake flowed down to the next water body in the basin, completing a chain link. The system worked well for the region in the Deccan Plateau where canal irrigation was not an option. Owing to the linkages, flooding could be avoided during monsoons, and there would be enough water impounded for summer crops. The rulers recognised this fact, and through their diktats, maintained the lakes’ health. They also added new lakes, constructed strong bunds and drains to control the flows, and maintained and developed them.

After independence, the lakes came under the centralised command of the Irrigation Department, alienating the users from their water bodies. Since the 1970s, the pace of urbanisation has picked up, substituting the traditional value of subsistence placed on the land with that of real estate. As the city spread, traditional vocations such as agriculture and fishing vanished. Concrete jungles took over within no time.

A unique aspect of the Asafjahi rule was its grant of titles to farmers in the lake beds so that when water receded in summer, the alluvial soil offered them bounty crop. No activity apart from farming was allowed on the lake bed.

With urbanisation fast catching up, and infrastructure creation not apace with it, lakes became the handy receptacles of the city’s sewage. Builders laid sewage lines up to the nearest lake, or connected them to the storm water drain network wherever it existed. The capital region is so replete with such interconnections between sewage lines and storm water drains that ‘dry flows’ is a standardised term for sewage flow into drains during the dry season. As a fallout, eutrophication soon set into the lakes, making the lakes rich with weed and poor in water-holding capacity and biodiversity. The fish died. The water became unfit for any kind of consumption. Slowly, but surely, the lake shrunk in area, quantity and quality.

Farmers and their descendants who had titles inside the lake beds sold the exposed land. Wherever the lakes became veritable sewage repositories, the urban poor settled in those areas. And where the waters were still pristine enough to proffer a ‘lake view’, the plots were sold at premium rates. Gigantic infrastructure development projects taken up by the successive governments, including the Outer Ring Road, Hyderabad Metro Rail, and the Strategic Road Development Plan, to name a few, tampered with the topography of the capital region and altered the hydrology of the lake basins. The role of land sharks, who many a time are the political leaders themselves, cannot be understated, in filling the foreshore areas of the lake bed with debris and raising structures within the full tank level.

It would not be an exaggeration to state that there is not one lake in the limits of Greater Hyderabad which has been exempted from this fate, including the famed Hussain Sagar lake. The status of the lakes in the municipalities/corporations surrounding the State capital is worse.

Shrinking water bodies

From one lakh, the water bodies have drastically come down to 185 within the Greater Hyderabad capital region, and to 3,132 within the limits of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) as enumerated by its Lake Protection Committee till date. Of the 185 lakes in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), for 75, the surplus weirs and courses are completely closed.

According to a report on the disappearing water bodies of Hyderabad, by the Society for Participatory Development, submitted to the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, in 2017, the city had lost 3,245 hectares of water bodies in the previous 12 years.

The Lake Protection Committee was constituted in 2010 upon the High Court’s directions responding to a PIL. It is headed by the HMDA Commissioner, and has members from departments such as GHMC, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, Irrigation, Panchayat Raj, Environment and Forests, and five district administrations under the HMDA’s purview. The Committee had been inept in terms of enforcement. It has limited itself to counting lakes alone. It has failed to fulfil its mandate of identifying lakes, demarcating boundaries and buffer zones for them, fencing them with FTL (Full Tank Level) stones, and preserving them by preventing and removing encroachments. Of the 3,132 water bodies, all formalities have been completed with respect to only 224. This number has remained unchanged for the past one year. Even where the FTL boundaries are notified, encroachments within have remained untouched, owing to several sociopolitical dynamics.

The decay of Gurram Cheruvu

Palle Cheruvu and Gurram Cheruvu are part of the Umda Sagar lake’s watershed area as per the Survey of India’s topology sheets. Gurram Cheruvu receives its inflows from Pedda Cheruvu of the same basin, which in turn is downstream of the Burhan Khan lake. There is one more unnotified water body, the Shukur lake, in the same line, emptying into Gurram Cheruvu.

The Burhan Khan lake, which is uppermost in the hydrological chain, is a huge water body with an FTL of 132 acres, of which 130 acres were intact till 2013 when it was surveyed. The government, however, had given plots for a housing colony for the poor in the lake bed, while on the other side came up a gated community, partially encroaching on the lake. A temple is now seen under construction in the foreshore area near the weir, dumped heavily with debris. During the recent floods, the lake began to submerge the colony of the poor.

While the Pedda Cheruvu and Shukur Sagar lake are relatively unhindered, rampant construction on the surplus course of both have choked the inlet of the Gurram Cheruvu. This has inundated colonies at the lake’s mouth when a deluge of inflows arrived from upstream due to copious rains.

On the northern edge, the Gurram Cheruvu’s main sluice was buried under heavy encroachment encouraged by local leaders and their henchmen. Truckloads of debris were allegedly dumped into the lake and levelled using heavy machinery, about which a police complaint had already been lodged by the Tehsildar in the Chandrayangutta Police Station, but to no avail. When the lake brimmed after two decades, officials were caught in a cleft stick, as Hafiz Baba Nagar residents settled downstream demanded diversion of the water. Meanwhile, the lake’s backwater had drowned the Barkas locality neck deep.

Instead of clearing the encroachment, and opening the sluice, officials tried to widen the weir portion, weakening the bund. It breached at midnight, and all hell broke loose.

The decay of this lake began not more than two decades ago. “Our uncle had agriculture under the lake. We grew paddy and vegetables, and he would distribute the crop after storing some for our needs. When the bullocks got sick, we the cousins would carry the plough along in the field,” recalls Aslam Bin Haji Al Baghdadi, 25, a resident of the area. Now, there is no farming or fishing here. The water is filled with water hyacinth weed.

A sewage receptacle

Water hyacinth defines the other lake of doom, the Palle Cheruvu, too. This lake is privately owned, just like its source lake, the Umda Sagar. Umda Sagar receives its inflows from Jalapalli Lake of the same basin. Reports about encroachments into the Jalapalli Lake appeared in the media, while the HMDA is yet to notify the centuries-old tank.

Palle Cheruvu tells the story of how a water body surrounded by burgeoning residential colonies has become a sewage receptacle. When Umda Sagar upstream started overflowing, the surplus water entered Palle Cheruvu, which had only one small drain, two feet wide. While the Irrigation Department maintains that the lake had breached, local people say that the lake topped over the bund and gushed on to the road and the surrounding areas on the night when Qureshi lost eight members of his family. Post the tragedy, irrigation officials were seen dumping tonnes of earth on the bund in order to raise its height.

“The outflow channel of Palle Cheruvu meets the surplus channels of two more lakes, the Salkam Cheruvu and the Surram Cheruvu, from the same basin. Together with the Gurram Cheruvu outflow, it becomes a massive stream roaring towards the Musi River during floods. But the channel is now occupied by structures, severely restricting the flow,” says Lubna Sarwat from Save Our Urban Lakes.

Gurram Cheruvu and Palle Cheruvu are both in the HMDA’s list of notified lakes. In the Umda Sagar basin, 14 of the 28 lakes had totally disappeared between 1978 and 2017, while three were in the process of disappearing, as per the study report submitted to IISc, Bengaluru. The area under water spread had reduced from 236 hectares to 134 acres.

A 2017 research paper on remote sensing study by ICRISAT and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala records the shrinkage of water bodies in the city and its surrounding areas over 16 years. In 2005, lakes recorded a total acreage of 12,535 ha. In 2016, this reduced to 2,283 ha. This means that all the floodwater that would otherwise have been impounded in these lakes, enriching the ground water, quenching thirst and feeding biodiversity of the basin is now let berserk either into the surrounding lakes, or into low-lying areas, inundating homes and killing the residents.

A long-term action plan needed

But the authorities are still to learn their lessons. There is no single authority dealing with the lakes in the city. GHMC has a separate wing for lakes, and takes its own decisions about their development. One measure receiving criticism is the laying of walking tracks around the water bodies, by filling the boundary paths. The corporation has tried engineering solutions for inundation, such as constructing box-type RCC storm water drains from areas of flooding up to the nearest lake, but this has given rise to another problem by impounding more water than the lake can hold.

Two studies — one by Kirloskar Consultancy in 2002 for the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad and the other by the Voyants Consultancy in 2008 for GHMC — recommended widening and improving storm water drains, and diverting sewage.

The Voyants’ Master Plan divided the entire GHMC area into 16 hydraulic zones and identified 173 major drains, 391-km long, which needed decongestion and widening immediately. Its implementation necessitates the acquisition of 28,800 properties encroaching on the drains, an insurmountable task. Only about 35 km of the drains could be cleared till 2016 when the city experienced inundation yet again in several areas, forcing the government to consider the proposals seriously.

Ananth Maringanti, an environmentalist from Hyderabad Urban Labs, says, “It is time to seriously consider long-term definitive action, rather than resorting to drastic measures. The city has pushed its most deprived to the edges of the water bodies, and the socioeconomic dimensions involved in displacing them cannot be ignored.”

The devastation of the past few weeks forced the government to announce a ₹550 crore relief package. On October 19, Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao said that ₹1 lakh would be given to those whose houses were fully damaged. Owners of partially damaged houses would be given ₹50,000. Another ₹10,000 would be given to households in low-lying areas who were hit hard by the flood.

Upstream of the Gurram Cheruvu bund, where Sayeed Colony, Ali Gulshan Colony and Hamshan Colony remained flooded for several days, Ali Bin Abdallah claims that calls made to political leaders remained unanswered. Till October 20, he alleged, neither senior officers of the GHMC nor of the revenue department arrived to assess losses.

It was voluntary organisations that began to plug the perceived yawning gap in relief work. NGOs rescued victims and provided them with immediate relief in the form of food and clothing. WhatsApp groups and places of worship turned into relief war rooms. GPS coordinates of where essential supplies were needed the most were posted, with students and professionals working at the grassroots delivering them to those in need.“Providing relief began soon after rains hit the city and was crucial in plugging some gaps. To avoid duplication of work, a few organisations have come together to chalk out a strategy,” says activist S.Q. Masood.

Caught in a difficult situation, the State government is blaming the problems on the unprecedented rainfall in a single day. As per a study by the department of Civil Engineering, BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, extreme daily rainfall in the city will be a recurring phenomenon in future too. The study has postulated that in 2040, 2045, 2068, 2088 and 2098, the city may experience intense rainfall in a day ranging between 27 cm and 69 cm. How the city prepares to mitigate the potential damage that it will bring is to be seen.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/eo3di1/article32932506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GurramCheruvu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-revenge-of-the-lakes-in-hyderabad/article32932513.ece
206,2020/10/24,Ernakulam district administration’s testing strategy cuts both ways,"Infection spread may go undetected if contacts of patients are not tested, says official

The Ernakulam district administration’s decision to test symptomatic people alone will help diagnose COVID-19 infection in vulnerable people early on, but could leave several cases undetected.

“With the surge now, the strategy is to identify and test symptomatic people as early as possible to contain the spread of infection and reduce mortality. When people with sore throat, cough, fever, diarrhoea, or breathing troubles report these symptoms, they are tested immediately. Peripheral health-care facilities are now focusing their resources on identifying and testing symptomatic people in their vicinity, rather than contacts of patients who might already be in quarantine,” said Dr. Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission. Vulnerable primary contacts with co-morbidities will continue to be tested, he added.

An official at the district surveillance unit, however, said a policy of not testing contacts of patients could mean that the source of infection goes undetected in a lot more cases. “We will miss asymptomatic positives who might venture out even if they are asked to remain in quarantine for 14 days. After a while, we might even start missing mildly symptomatic patients. Widespread testing among vulnerable populations, among contacts, and in areas where clusters might form, needs to continue, rather than just testing symptomatic people,” he said.

But the disease is now headed towards an endemic stage, which means it is everywhere, said Dr. A. Sukumaran, former State epidemiologist. “For immediate containment early on, testing both asymptomatic and symptomatic people was important. Now, we can no longer prevent the spread, so minimising it is the practical approach. For that, testing only symptomatic people and preventing death is justified,” he said. People without symptoms dying suddenly is very rare, he pointed out.

The flip side to focusing on symptomatic people who might develop severe complications is that the spread can still happen through asymptomatic individuals, said Dr. Rakhal Gaitonde, Professor, Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies at the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology. “Any strategy that does not test adequately among primary and secondary contacts or at least among primary contacts is likely to miss the way the virus spreads. If people who could potentially spread the disease are not identified, it could lead to new outbreaks. Testing among primary and secondary contacts is a minimum requirement to ensure we don’t have cases that are undiagnosed,” he observed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/tybv5x/article32933469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24-KI-POOTHOTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ernakulam-district-administrations-testing-strategy-cuts-both-ways/article32933470.ece

208,2020/10/24,PCB finds rampant violation of SWM rules at Brahmapuram,"Facilities for waste treatment at the site not maintained properly

The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) has found violations of the Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016, at the Brahmapuram dumping yard of the Kochi Corporation.

The board’s findings have found place in the notice on environment compensation issued to the civic body on October 15 for unscientific handling of waste at the site. An inspection held by the board on July 23 found that the facilities for treatment and disposal of solid waste at the site were not maintained properly.

The windrow composting shed is in a dilapidated condition, and mixed solid waste, including plastic, was found dumped in the open. The manure produced seems to be marginal compared to the quantity of waste collected daily at the plant. It did not meet the fertilizer standards as per the SWM Rules, 2016 and contained heavy metals, according to the report.

Huge quantities of rejects have been dumped at various places, resulting in the formation of legacy waste. Fire mishaps were reported in the legacy waste dumping yard three or four times in 2019 and this year, causing air pollution in and around the site.

Leachate from the windrow composting shed and biodegradable solid waste were not collected and treated properly owing to improper drains, and there were chances of leachate reaching the nearby Kadambrayar river. Incidentally, the waterbody figured among the polluted river stretches identified by the Central Pollution Control Board.

The leachate treatment plant set up prior to the visit by the Regional Monitoring Committee appointed by the National Green Tribunal in January last was found defunct.

209,2020/10/24,Smart monitoring of waste management on the anvil,"LSGD to conduct audit of homes ahead of rolling out the project

The Haritha Keralam Mission (HKM) is considering setting up automated waste management system in select local bodies in Ernakulam to step up efficiency of waste collection and management.

The move forms part of the government’s efforts to streamline and improve waste management services. Two proposals on intelligent and automated waste management systems are on the anvil. The first digital system is being developed with technical support from the Integrated Rural Technology Centre in Palakkad. Senior officials of the Department of Local Self-Governments said the software would help in tracking waste collection by Haritha Karma Sena volunteers from each home. Waste generators can pay their user fee through the digital mode.

“We will have to carry out an audit of homes in select civic bodies ahead of launching the initiative. Relevant data for running the system will be integrated with the digital platform. Each house will be provided with a QR code. Members of each household can attach the QR code at the entrance to the house,” they said.

The green volunteers engaged in waste collection will scan the QR code using their mobile phones. Data on the quantity of waste collected and the user fee remitted by users will be uploaded to the centralised system. The project will be introduced in a few local bodies in the first phase to gauge the technical hurdles in its implementation. The authorities also plan to seek the support of companies and establishments in select local bodies for the execution of the venture. They can spare a share of their corporate social responsibility funds for the novel project.

For the second project under consideration, the software for the smart garbage monitoring system has been developed by Keltron. Besides keeping track of the collection process, the mobile application will help users raise complaints, if any, about shortcomings in waste collection from households. Their complaints will be transferred online to officials of civic bodies for follow-up action. Citizens can also alert instances of dumping or burning of waste in violation of rules to the authorities.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/smart-monitoring-of-waste-management-on-the-anvil/article32933411.ece
210,2020/10/24,Tourism stakeholders of West Kochi upbeat about November 1 reopening,"They pin hopes on CSML’s efforts to relay roads and construct drains

The famed heritage streets of Fort Kochi and the beach front, which used to teem with foreign and domestic tourists in the October-February tourist season, presents a striking contrast now, with street dogs literally outnumbering the few local residents who venture out once in a while.

Similar is the case with most other tourist locales in West Kochi, be it heritage areas in neighbouring Mattancherry or even Kumbalanghi, hailed as India’s first model tourism village. But stakeholders are hopeful that the situation will improve when the State government permits regulated entry into beach destinations from November 1.

One among the founders of Clean Fort Kochi Foundation, David Lawrence, who also owns a homestay in the heritage zone, said residents and tourism stakeholders were dismayed at streets remaining deserted despite the onset of the tourist season. “Of course, entry to the beach has been temporarily curbed, with Section 144 in vogue to prevent crowding. This has been the situation in the high-in-demand locale since mid-March when the lockdown was announced. The government must urgently repair the beach walkway which is in ruins due to sea erosion,” he added.

He attributed the proliferation of street dogs in the area to people who regularly feed them, and the often uncleared garbage. “Our foundation used to clean the beach and streets every week, with the assistance of four daily-wage workers. In addition, a team of 20 workers engaged by the Ernakulam DTPC and Fort Kochi Heritage Conservation Society are duty-bound to ensure cleanliness of the premises every day. Sadly, this has not been happening, mainly due to slack supervision.”

The silver lining is that Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) is relaying roads and building drains in an effective manner, despite opposition from a few quarters, including encroachers. Subsequently, streets do not get flooded, and rain water does not enter low-lying buildings. Tourists can be assured of good roads and pavements this time, Mr. Lawrence said.

Kumbalanghi

Kumbalanghi, located on the other end of West Kochi, has its own share of problems, including a spike in COVID-19 cases. “This could be because physical distancing is seldom maintained, especially in tea shops and public transport. People can often be seen wearing face masks on the lower jaw. However, life is going on as usual in the area, but for almost nil inflow of tourists,” said M.P. Sivadattan, former president of Kumbalanghi panchayat and director of Kerala Kerala Homestay and Tourism Society.

Sometimes, guests visit homestays and other properties in the village to unwind and enjoy ethnic dishes. They do not opt to stay overnight though. Most operators of homestays, which have elderly people or kids, are not entertaining guests. On their part, the Kerala Tourism and the Responsible Tourism Mission are proactively doing their part, hosting webinars and numerous other activities to woo discerning tourists interested in experiential tourism that Kumbalanghi is famous for. Tour packages are being readied keeping them in mind, he added.

People who erected Chinese nets in the area are happy at the phased removal of around 1,000 unauthorised nets which affected the livelihood of a few hundred traditional fishermen in the area. Around 300 nets have already been removed, it is learnt.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/xw5ep8/article32935036.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22kijlp02TouriGPV7T3D2T3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/tourism-stakeholders-of-west-kochi-upbeat-about-november-1-reopening/article32933367.ece
211,2020/10/24,Tribute to Chenda maestro Kalamandalam Kesava Poduval,"By adding the subtle nuances while playing the percussion instrument Kalamandalam Kesava Poduval redefined the aesthetics of Chenda

In 2016, the octogenarian took a detailed trip to his native village he had left six decades ago. By this time, Kalamandalam Kesava Poduval was renowned more as a Kathakali percussionist than a tayambaka exponent.

The hilly surroundings of Anakkara in Palakkad district was where Poduval lived till 25, showing promise as a chenda artiste in the solo tayambaka concert steeped in classical Malamakkavu style. Along with his two brothers, there emerged a notable trio who were mentored by their father Kudalil Achutha Poduval. Then, in 1956, the youngster opted to play for Kathakali. And joined Kalamandalam, the dance-drama’s premier institution in Cheruthuruthy, 35 km east of his house near scenic Kumbidi.

There, under the illustrious Krishnankutty Poduval and Achunni Poduval, the youngster imbibed the nuances of chenda in adding to Kathakali’s theatrical value. Soon after his course, Kesava Poduval found a job in Muthappan Kaliyogam at upstate Parassini near Kannur. That stint (1961-63) ended ahead of an invitation from an institute south of Kochi.

Legion of disciples

Thus, in 1964, Poduval joined RLV College of Music and Fine Arts in Tripunithura. The 22-year service earned him not just a good line-up of students; the temple town helped Poduval prove his percussive skills and emerge as a fairly busy performer across Kerala.

His retirement from RLV in 1986 no way portended inaction. Poduval continued with his private tuitions, grooming talents into decent practitioners of Kathakali chenda, tayambaka and even melam—the festival ensemble spanning no less than three hours.

“Age was no bar. From children to the middle-aged, the master took each under his wings. Females were no taboo,” points out Gopikrishnan Thampuran, a frontline disciple of Poduval who died this month. “He won’t lose his poise with the below-par or lazy.”

Kalamandalam Kesavan Poduval learning under Kalamandalam Achunni Poduval

Unruffled conduct and understated chenda-playing were the hallmarks of the maestro, who breathed his last on October 10, months short of turning 90. The cool head enabled him to maintain a twin career, though by the mid-1970s Poduval decided to virtually quit tayambaka and focus on Kathakali chenda.

“Old-timers say tayambaka’s loss ended up to be Kathakali’s gain,” recalls Gopikrishnan, who took Poduval to his ancestral land four years ago as part of a crew shooting a documentary on the master. The endeavour bore fruit

in early 2017 when NadaKesavam was released as a short movie at a function back in Tripunithura to honour Poduval, a winner of the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi award.

Author-scholar T S Madhavan Kutty notes a symbiotic relation between tayambaka and Kathakali chenda. “Trained Kathakali drummers tend to be poetic in their tayambaka,” he states. “In other words, Kathakali chenda can make your tayambaka suitably restrained.”

Trusted colleague

Poduval, essentially, was both. Never the outgoing type, his calm sweetness was evident in playing the chenda as well. Kathakali veteran Sadanam Krishnankutty says background percussion was safe and sturdy when Poduval led it. “Technically, we are from different schools. Yet, if it’s him on the chenda, we never discussed stage procedures in advance,” he says.

Incidentally, Krishnankutty kept insisting that Poduval must let his only son learn maddalam, the drum that plays complementary to the chenda in Kathakali. The proposal bore fruit: Kalamandalam Sasikumar not only gained name in his 30s, he teamed up with his father on Kathakali daises featuring the slow and fast choreographies.

Maddalam guru Gopikkuttan Nair, who turned out to be a colleague of Sasikumar at Kalamandalam, trails off the annual pilgrimages he undertook with Poduval to Sabarimala in the 1980s. “At the famed Ayyappa temple on Vishu days, we’d present Kathakali,” he says. The shows were invariably led by the iconic Kalamandalam Krishnan Nair, who was also Poduval’s colleague at RLV.

Kathakali artiste Geetha Varma has similar memories about Poduval joining a troupe largely comprising females. “Inside the van and at the greenroom, he would be typically withdrawn. Behind the hand-held curtain, when I’d enter as the character and pay the ceremonial obeisance, he’d pat on my shoulder,” she says. “That was inspiring

Vocalist Kalamandalam Sreekumar recalls a 1996 journey upcountry. “In wintry Dehradun, we were to wear sweaters. Poduval wooed us into the age-old tradition of performing bare-chested,” he says. Chimes in musician Pathiyoor Sakarankutty: “Never will Poduval distract anyone on stage with his showmanship.” Top chenda artiste Kalamandalam Krishnadas concurs, adding, “No off-key note. So musical!”

Such assets existed even as a student at Kalamandalam, says Panjal Unnikrishnan, his contemporary at the institution. “Much elder to me, yes. So we’d take tips on chenda lessons from him,” he says. A couple of years later, I accompanied him at a tayambaka. Terrific!”

The master’s RLV-time pupil Kuttipuzha Balachandran reveals Poduval’s love for cinema posters. Adds Gopikrishnan: “Clock repair was a parallel interest.”

Poduval’s son Sasikumar met with a fatal road accident in 2010. That made the master reclusive. For chenda lovers, though, memories would resonate.

212,2020/10/24,‘Owning your identity is the most valuable thing to do’: Yung Raja,"Singaporean Tamil rapper Yung Raja on his latest single ‘The Dance Song’ that is all about owning one’s identity

It’s all about the vibes with Yung Raja, the 25-year-old Singaporean hip hop artiste whose latest single — ‘The Dance Song’ — is picking up traction on streaming platforms. Since its release two weeks ago, the song has been viewed over 4.5 lakh times on YouTube.

Raja’s parents emigrated to Singapore, where he was born and raised, from Tamil Nadu nearly two decades ago. But the young rapper prefers to put Tamil culture front and centre of the music he creates; for instance, ‘The Dance Song’ bears Rajinikanth and Tamil cinema influences. Over a phone call from Singapore, Raja asserts that he chooses to promote this multilingual brand of music.

“My [Tamil] culture and my language is rich. But for it to be digestive or resonate with someone who does not understand it, there should not be a barrier,” he says, explaining the reason why he mixes English into his songs. “Being bilingual is unique only to certain parts of the world. I am someone who speaks Tamil and English equally. So, it is an advantage I have,” he adds.

‘The Dance Song’ is amusing. For one, you have Raja making the waves: he dances to the song by waving his hands and body out of rhythm; the lyrics — a part of the verse goes: “...this ponnu in love with my kolanthe face, her aunty gon tell me how this kolambu taste, buggers with pulippu push me to moradan stage (sic)...” — also doesn’t lack mirth.

Yet Raja maintains that there is something beyond the entertainment aspect. “It is a song that people can watch and totally forget about what is going on around the world”, he says, describing it as a track that celebrates owning one’s identity.

“That is the most important message. I think people don’t understand how much identity is valued in today’s world. Being a part of the hip hop community, I have the unique privilege of being able to speak the truth through my art,” he says, adding, “For me, being an artiste is a privilege. It is not just about uplifting people and bringing them together, but to be able to tell them who Yung Raja is in an uncut manner... it is something I take pride in.”

Raja is now associated with the marquee music label Def Jam, which is known for its association with musicians like Jay-Z, Rihanna, Ludacris and Kanye West. Raja, too, is looking forward to pull clear of other emerging hip hop talents from Southeast Asian countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam etc., by addressing a common complaint levelled against him: that he doesn’t produce enough music. “I have released only one song a year in the last two years. That structure is going to change, and there will be more music and more vibes.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/uzej3p/article32936352.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Yung-Raja-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/owning-your-identity-is-the-most-valuable-thing-to-do-yung-raja/article32936353.ece
213,2020/10/24,Coronavirus | Fewer people on Kolkata streets this Durga Puja,"Strict safety norms put in place

The Calcutta High Court order making Durga Puja pandals “no entry zones”, and the awareness generated by the administration in asking people to stay indoors to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, seemed to have worked as there were fewer people on the streets in Kolkata during the peak of Durga Puja festivities

On October 23, when the State celebrated Saptami, the Kolkata Metro, which is considered the lifeline of transport in the city, ferried about 34,000 passengers. On a usual weekday before the Puja, the North South line of Kolkata Metro typically ferries more than twice the number of passengers. For instance, on October 21, 84,801 commuters had availed the services of the Kolkata Metro.

On Saturday, October 24, the day when Astami is observed till 7 p.m. in the evening, only 24,300 passengers took the metro ride.

Kolkata Metro officials said that there was hardly any crowd in the trains and on the platforms today. Unlike previous years, the Kolkata Metro has decided not to run special overnight trains to manage the Durga Puja crowd. The last trains are leaving the terminal station at 9 p.m.

Meanwhile, a few incidents have come to the fore in the past few days, when the Kolkata Police had to asked Durga Puja pandals not to allow visitors in the pandals. From north Kolkata to south Kolkata, Puja pandals did not have much by of crowds. While people did descend on the streets in some areas, crowding in the Durga Puja pandals was largely avoided. In districts and towns of the State, the situation was the same and not much crowding was observed inside pandals.

There are a number of other factors that led to fewer crowds this Durga Puja, officials said. While people have become aware that crowding could lead to a spike in infections, suburban and local trains are also not plying, which makes it difficult for people from the districts to soak in the festivities in the city.

Meanwhile, the rituals related to Durga Puja like Anjali (offering of flowers) and Kumari Puja, were observed across all community Durga Pujas in the State. There are about 37,000 community Durga Pujas in the State, of which 3,000 are organised in Kolkata.

59 deaths in Bengal

West Bengal on Saturday added 4,148 new COVID-19 infections, taking the total infections in the State to 3,45,574. Fifty-nine people succumbed to the viral infections, taking the COVID-19 toll in the State to 6,427. The active cases in the State increased to 36,807, while the discharge rate marginally declined to 87.49%. Of the 59 deaths, Kolkata recorded 19 deaths, taking the COVID-19 toll in the city to 2,097. North 24 Parganas recorded 14 deaths, taking the toll in the district to 1,464. Kolkata added 895 new COVID-19, while the number of COVID-19 infections in North 24 Parganas was 896.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/m1mwv4/article32937680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25th-metro,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/fewer-people-on-kolkata-streets-this-durga-puja/article32937681.ece
214,2020/10/24,Chittaprosad Bhattacharya’s paintings on display in online exhibition,"Victoria Memorial Hall joins hands with DAG for unique initiative during pandemic

Every year, during the festival season, art galleries and museums in and around Kolkata curate exhibitions mostly centred on the theme of festivals. As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, presenting challenges to galleries and museums in organising physical exhibitions, the question that many of these institutions are grappling with is what kind of art they should bring into the public domain.

Victoria Memorial Hall, along with DAG, a private art gallery, has decided to put together the art of celebrated painter Chittaprosad, known for his heart-wrenching sketches and drawings of the Bengal Famine of 1943-44, alongside economic exploitation, urban poverty and depravity.

“It is a good time to choose the digital platform to convey some of the anguish from a people’s artist and for all of us to use this festive season to get out of our comfort zones,” Jayanta Sengupta, secretary and curator of Victoria Memorial Hall, said.

The online exhibition titled ‘People’s Artist – Chittaprosad: In Solidarity, In Solitude’ has more than 40 works of the celebrated artist, from around Independence. Chittaprosad Bhattacharya (1915-1978) was a member of the Communist Party of India and worked as an artist-cadre during the tumultuous years before and after the birth of the new Republic.'

His explorations of new spaces of political action led him to his work for children through puppets and storytelling, and shift into a more personal and intimate space of politics. In 1968, he wrote “art is neither a weapon or a means of propaganda of any ideology—as we were told a few years ago by the political pundits”, revealing his commitment to developing a visual language that could speak directly to and for all people.

Along with the online exhibition, the VMH and DAG have also organised five different events in October and November, where experts, art historians and academicians will shed light on the work of the celebrated artist. The events include a book talk by Sanjukta Sunderason (Leiden University) that will look at Chittaprosad’s experiments in art and politics, introduced and moderated by well-known art historian Tapati Guha-Thakurta.

The artworks in the online exhibition have been sourced from the Ghare Baire, an exhibition put together by DAG at Currency Building, Kolkata and from the collection of DAG. Ghare Baire - The World, The Home and Beyond: 18th-20th Century Art in Bengal was commissioned by the Ministry of Culture, Government of India, and it has been produced by DAG in collaboration with NGMA.

The exhibition that brings together three centuries of art from Bengal under one roof is at the newly-restored Currency Building in Kolkata.

“The exhibition, true to the spirit of Chittaprosad, has been curated through a collective process, where a group of students from across the world have joined our ‘Curious Curatorium’ initiative. They are a part of a month-long exploration of the artworks, developing the curatorial framework and building a narrative through their selection of artworks,” said Sumona Chakravarty, Deputy Director, Ghare Baire, DAG Museums.

Pointing out that the online exhibition on Chittaprosad and events around it has generated good response, Ms Chakravarty said that for online exhibition one has to think about exhibitions in a broader context, which is the dialogue and discourse around the exhibition.

Mr Sengupta, who feels that online exhibitions afford a more intimate engagement with art that is sometimes lost in the solitude of individual visitors in grand, overpowering museum spaces, said that the exhibition on Chittaprosad has been “planned it in a way that it grows and grows, and acquires a life of its own by means of the conversations and interactions we seek to enable through talks and workshops”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/h531y2/article32936349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHITTAP1738-1-1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/chittaprosad-bhattacharyas-paintings-on-display-in-online-exhibition/article32936200.ece
215,2020/10/24,Concern as contagious infection affects goats in rural areas,"Unavailability of vaccine, lack of adequate number of vets worrying farmers

With the unavailability of vaccine and lack of adequate number of government veterinary doctors, a contagious viral infection in goats has started troubling a large number of small scale farmers in the rural areas of Kozhikode district. Most of the farmers now depend on the service of private doctors to administer the vaccine, which costs ₹400 a shot.

Farmers from Velam panchayat, which reported the highest number of cases, said the veterinary doctors in their area were working as sectoral magistrates as part of the additional COVID-19 duty. The government should at least consider the deployment of additional veterinary doctors or should relieve the veterinary doctors from COVID-19 duty to meet the crisis, they said.

Following the farmers’ complaints, the Velam grama panchayat authorities visited some of the affected areas and discussed possible solutions with higher authorities. They said a veterinary doctor from Kunnummal block panchayat was brought to the spot to administer the first shot of the vaccine in 40 affected goats. Additional vaccines would be required to administer the second and third shots to those animals, they said.

“The viral infection has been reported from different locations in Kerala. What we want now is the required quantity of vaccines for saving the affected animals. There should be enough doctors to handle this vaccination process,” said Velam grama panchayat president V.K. Abdulla. He said farmers would not be able to afford the services of private doctors and private medicine suppliers. He said the skin disease was found causing serious disfigurement in goats with scabs around the lips, muzzle and mouth.

Officials from the Animal Husbandry Department said the spread of the disease had been confirmed from different parts of Kerala and effective treatment was available for saving the animals. “It reportedly spread through the infected livestock brought here from other States. Measures are in place to get the required quantity of vaccines for effective treatment,” they added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/70nt0e/article32933494.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24kigoatfarmjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/concern-as-contagious-infection-affects-goats-in-rural-areas/article32933496.ece
216,2020/10/24,Illegal construction: Kozhikode Corpn. serves notice on MLA,"Town planning dept. finds violations during inspection

The Kozhikode Corporation on Friday served notice on Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) legislator K.M. Shaji for the alleged unlawful construction of his house near the civil station in the city.

Official sources said a notice had been served under Section 406 (demolition or alteration of building work unlawfully commenced, carried on or completed) of the Kerala Municipality Act. Mr. Shaji was also served with a provisional order requiring him to show cause within 14 days on the illegal construction and stop all construction activities with immediate effect.

The development comes a day after the Town Planning Department team, during an inspection of the house, found that the total space of construction was 5,500 sq.ft although permission had been granted to construct a house of 3,200 sq. ft.

The house in Vengeri revenue village is under the possession of Asha, Mr. Shaji’s wife, and permission for its construction was granted in 2013.

Taxes not paid

The officials found that the owner had not secured occupancy certificate from the civic authorities. No taxes had been paid as the house had not been allotted a number. However, a temporary electricity connection had been acquired at the time of construction of the house.

The Town Planning Department carried out the inspection based on a directive from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is probing a bribery case related to the sanctioning of Plus Two courses for an aided school at Azhikode in Kannur district in 2014.

The case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act was that Plus Two courses were sanctioned to the school after collecting a bribe of ₹25 lakh from the management.

A notice has been served on Mr. Shaji to be present for questioning next month. A report on the inspection would be submitted to the ED on Tuesday.

Officials said that in cases of unauthorised construction without serious violations, the owner would usually be asked to pay a penalty, remit pending taxes and the house regularised. Only in rare cases, prosecution is initiated and demolition carried out.

‘To look into lapses’

Meanwhile, Mayor Thottathil Raveendran said the Corporation would look into lapses if any on the part of Revenue inspectors and tax collectors.

Mr. Shaji, however, has dismissed the matter as frivolous and termed the episode politically motivated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/ih9j1u/article31880906.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TV03CORPORATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/illegal-construction-kozhikode-corpn-serves-notice-on-mla/article32933490.ece
217,2020/10/24,Kerala to get 700 Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras by next Feb.,"MVD move to improve automated traffic enforcement

As part of improving its automated traffic enforcement activities, the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) will introduce 700 Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras in the State by February 2021. The portable devices with Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities will work with the support of 14 special control rooms.

The Kerala Road Safety Authority will fund the project. It is also a part of the ongoing Safe Kerala campaign of the State government to mitigate road accident deaths. The plan of the MVD is to gradually end manual enforcement activities and explore the use of AI-based tools.

The MVD had previously introduced e-challans through point-of-sale (POS) machines to collect fines from traffic rule violators. It has been a convenient option for many to use debit or credit cards for spot fine payment. For the MVD, it has come as an effective tool to ensure transparency in transactions and faster enforcement. The device also has options to take photographs of violators or vehicles and prepare online check reports.

Joint Transport Commissioner Rajeev Puthalath said the proposed addition to digital platforms would streamline enforcement activities with cent percent accuracy and help reduce manpower to a large extent. The ANPR cameras could be placed anywhere to ensure flawless action against erring drivers, he added.

“The Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation (Keltron) will be handling the project implementation and its supervision. They are expected to conduct the trials by December with some of the ANPR cameras,” said Mr. Puthalath. According to him, the portable ANPR cameras will source solar power for operations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kerala-to-get-700-automatic-number-plate-recognition-cameras-by-next-feb/article32933484.ece

220,2020/10/24,Crime rate against weaker sections in TN has risen: AICC leader,"Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the weaker sections in many districts of Tamil Nadu were attacked, said All India Congress Committee secretary Sunil Dutt here on Saturday.

Speaking to reporters, he said that the poor handling of the pandemic by the Central government had claimed many lives. When Congress leader Rahul Gandhi warned about the virus spread and urged the BJP led government to take precautions, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi neglected, he charged.

Utilising the COVID-19 pandemic, the Scheduled Castes were targeted and exploited. It was unfortunate that the AIADMK government had not taken an iron hand against the attackers.

The Bihar election rallies were an indication that people wanted a change. The meetings of the Congress showed that the alliance would win hands down. This will be a beginning and soon, the Congress would be in power in all the poll-bound States.

Taking a dig at the BJP, Mr. Dutt went on to say that all the institutions built by the Congress in the past had been sold by the BJP now. No where in the globe well performing public sector undertakings would be sold. The BJP was keen to promote and protect their own ""friends""in the corporate world, the Congress leader charged and hence they were ""selling"" even the airports.

Criticising the BJP government for the plight of a rape victim in Hathras village, Uttar Pradesh, he said that the BJP's slogan should be read as ""save girl child and women from the BJP leaders...."" he lamented and said that the Dalit girl was deprived of even a decent last rites.

The people were baffled over the rising prices of essential commodities. Asked to comment on the price rise of onion, he said, even the Prime Minister may be unaware about the rise on prices of onions in the coming days. It was looking upward and may touch the price of yellow metal.

The people have started questioning the BJP leaders on the promise made by them in 2019 to bring back the absconders, who had cheated the public sector banks and took shelter abroad after swindling crores of rupees.

He lauded the district Congress presidents and functionaries for reaching out to the needy people in the State during the pandemic. He also recalled the yeomen services rendered by late H. Vasantha Kumar in Kanniyakumari. The Congress high command would decide on the candidate at the appropriate time, he replied.

223,2020/10/24,HC denies bail to accused in Gokul Raj murder case,"Taking into account that the trial in the Gokulraj murder case was at a crucial stage, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court dismissed the criminal appeals preferred by six accused facing trial in the case. The accused had challenged the dismissal of their bail applications by the III Additional Sessions Judge, Madurai.

Justice R. Tharani took cognisance of the fact that the court in 2019 had dismissed similar criminal appeals preferred by the four accused in the case. The court observed that out of the 116 witnesses, 86 were already examined and most of the witnesses yet to be examined were only official witnesses.

The Supreme Court has already passed an order to complete the trial in the case within a prescribed time limit. In view of the fact that connected bail petitions were dismissed by various courts and considering the order of the Supreme Court, releasing the accused on bail at this stage may cause delay in the disposal of the case, the court said.

“It is seen that the offence is grave in nature. Whether there is any overt act against the appellants and whether there is any evidence against them cannot be decided before the completion of the trial. The alleged motive for the occurrence is communal hatred which is against the Constitution,” the judge observed and dismissed the criminal appeals.

The appeals were preferred by Sathishkumar, Sridhar, Ranjith, Suresh, Giridhar and Prabhu facing trial in the murder case.

The Madras High Court transferred the trial in the case to Madurai based on a petition filed by the mother of Gokul Raj. She apprehended that she might not get justice if the trial was conducted in Namakkal, under hostile circumstances.

The body of Gokul Raj, belonging to a Scheduled Caste community, was found on a railway track near Pallipalayam, Namakkal district, on June 24, 2015. The youth’s mother alleged that her son was murdered for being in a relationship with a caste Hindu girl.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-denies-bail-to-accused-in-gokul-raj-murder-case/article32937337.ece

The complaint was that the father and son duo had lured Jeeva by saying that they would get him a big contract worth ₹200 crore in Maldives. In a bid to make him fall in the trap, they even allegedly assured to get him a bank loan arranged in Maldives through financial consultants.

To make the complainant believe, the father and son had made a few people from Maldives to hold a conference with Jeeva. As a first step, they wanted him to part with ₹40 lakh, which he had given on different dates.

225,2020/10/24,Violation of safety norms found at cracker unit,"Madurai

Rajalakshmi Fireworks near T. Kallupatti where a fire accident claimed seven lives on Friday was found to have blatantly violated safety rules by allowing too many workers and illegally making aerial fireworks.

A team of officials from Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), Sivakasi, on Saturday inspected the scene of accident. “The major violation in the unit, licensed by District Revenue Officer, was that it employed more workers than the permitted number,” Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives, R. Sundaresan said. The unit has two mound walls and two working sheds. Each mound wall can have only two employees and each working shed can have four workers. “It means the unit could have employed a maximum of 12 workers whereas there were at least 35 workers at the time of accident,” he added.

Allowing too many workers had led to increased death toll. Other major violation was that the shed had been used by multiple leases. “We have found labels of at least two fireworks companies on the premises of the unit. Only one entity is allowed to operate the unit under Explosives Rules,” Mr. Sundaresan said.

Since different companies had deployed their workers, the crowded employees had been working under the shade of trees whereas they are supposed to work within the working sheds.

They had also violated the safety norms by unauthorised stocking of finished and semi-finished goods at different places like the office room and laboratory.

While the units licensed by DRO have limited facilities, they were allowed to manufacture very limited types and quantity of fireworks. However, here they were making aerial and fancy fireworks goods violating the license conditions.

PESO would send its report to Madurai district administration for further action.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/nmku7t/article32937139.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25MASVK-FIREWORKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/violation-of-safety-norms-found-at-cracker-unit/article32937140.ece
226,2020/10/24,Price of shallot touches a new high,"At the wholesale market at Oddanchatram, it was being sold at ₹100 per kg

Despite the Central government’s ban on onion export and the State government’s initiative to sell the vegetable through cooperatives, the price refused to fall in the wholesale market at Oddanchatram on Saturday.

According to the merchants, the shallots were quoted at ₹100 per kg and the big onions were quoted at ₹80 per kg. “If this was the rate revolving in the wholesale market, the price would be higher in retail outlets and even higher in private chain stores,” Nagarajan, a farmer from Gujiliamparai said.

With rainfall continuing in many States from where onions arrive, the price may not come down for the next month or two, Muthu, a merchant said.

At least a dozen merchants sell onions - big and small at the uzhavar sandhai here. However, with prices sky-rocketing only five traders had onions. The total arrival at the sandhai was 600 kilos of shallots and 700 kilos of big onions. Though there were not many takers at this price, the Agriculture department official at the sandai said that people may buy at this rate as the prices may only look upwards till Deepavali.

With farmers' in Gujiliamparai, Yeriodu and Vedasandur having just commenced their crop activities, the harvest may happen only in mid or third week of January 2021. Until then, the prices may be revolving around ₹80 and above, they predicted.

Speaking to The Hindu, a Horticulture officer in Kodaikanal said that the government may increase onion imports from Egypt soon and prices would come down around ₹50 per kg and hoped that the Cooperative stores would sell them in large quantities ensuring that there was no artificial demand.

Another senior officer in Oddanchatram said that they have appealed to the wholesale merchants not to hoard the commodity as the imported onion was already available in cities like Madurai, where they were being sold at ₹40 per kg.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/3nsa19/article32936954.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA25ONIONSDGL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/price-of-shallot-touches-a-new-high/article32936955.ece

Throwing the mandatory safety protocols to the wind, people thronged the flower markets in the city for shopping ahead of Saraswathi and Ayudha Puja celebrations here on Saturday.

The prices of flowers, including jasmine and button rose, touched a new high in the Kamarajar and VOC Markets.

Hundreds of farmers from Srivaikundam, Eral, Sawyerpuram, Kulayankarisal, Kurumbur, Alwartirunagari and among other pockets brought in their produce from early morning onwards.

Other than the flowers, decorative items and puja materials were selling at a fancy price, Nagarajan, a flower merchant said and added that jasmine was the most expensive flower. Though the markets had good arrivals, the demand was also very high, he added.

With people rushing to the flower markets, there was relatively less activity in bazaar areas, where many wholesale and retail grocers had little sales through the day, Vincent a dhal merchant said and added that until Deepavali, the sales may not be very brisk as customers would go for textile and cracker shopping.

Though the police were visible in the markets, they were unable to stop people who were not wearing face masks. The outlets in the VOC Market too were packed heavily till 11 a.m., and many of the farmers and merchants too were not wearing the mask, a sanitary inspector from the health department of Thoothukudi Corporation said and added that the civic authorities made announcements through public address system at vantage locations, but these appeared to have fallen on deaf ears.

A medical officer at the Thoothukudi GH said that there were fever cases coming in from a few wards in the Corporation limits and it showed that there was an urgent need for self-discipline among all residents. Any negligence, may see a surge in COVID-19, he apprehended and hoped the people extended their fullest cooperation for the next 60 days.

In a press release, Collector Sandeep Nanduri said on Saturday that the residents should stay indoors and avoid crowding. In the event of stepping out, he appealed to the people to wear face masks and adhere to physical distancing.

234,2020/10/24,Land identified for textile park in Karkala,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in the 2020-21 budget announced two new textile parks to employ 3,000 people

The State government’s move to set up a textile park in Karkala in Udupi district has taken a leap with the Udupi district administration identifying 20 acres of government land at Miyar for the purpose.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in the Budget for 2020-21 had announced the setting up of two new textile parks in the State, one at Karkala and the other at Shiggaon in Haveri district. They will generate employment for 3,000 persons, he had said.

Udupi Additional Deputy Commissioner B. Sadashiva Prabhu told The Hindu that the district administration wrote to the government about two weeks ago seeking allotment of land identified for setting up the park. If needed, the government will be requested to allot more land later once the park on 20 acres became operational.

Assistant Director of the Department of Handlooms and Textiles, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, H. Shivashankar, said that once the government allots the land, a special purpose vehicle (SPV), a legal entity created to fulfil a specific task, will have to be constituted to take the proposal forward. The SPV will create infrastructure such as road, water and power supply, dormitory, hostel, restaurant and related facilities in the park and allot the sites for investors. The department has the provision to provide incentives up to 40 % to investors while they set up their units in the park, he said.

Referring to Udupi sari, which enjoys Geographical Indication (GI) tag, he said that not many youngsters are coming forward to weave this sari.

Mamatha Rai, trustee of Karkala-based Kadike Trust, which has been working to revive and popularise the Udupi sari for long, said that the twin districts now have 65 persons who weave Udupi sari with 25 weavers being in The Talipady Primary Weavers Service Cooperative Society Ltd., Kinnigoli, in Dakshina Kannada.

Ms. Rai said that the trust with financial assistance from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) provided four-month training, which got over on October 17, in weaving Udupi sari to 10 new weavers in the Talipady society. Following this training, the number of weavers in the Talipady society rose to 25.

The trust which launched “Save Udupi sari” campaign two-and-half years ago, including on social media, has been helping weavers by providing training in weaving and natural dying, in product diversification, designing aspects and for marketing the sari. It has also helped in getting GI tag for the sari.

“Two years ago there were no Udupi sari weavers below 55 years in the twin districts. The 10 new weavers who have joined the Talipady society are aged between 34 and 56,” she said and added that youngsters are joining the weaving profession in the two districts after about 25 years now.

He said that the administration had entered into an agreement with Jyoti Advertisers on July 22, 2008, for managing the beach on public-private partnership and it came to an end on March 23, 2018.

Legal proceedings initiated by the private partner came to be dismissed by respective courts.

236,2020/10/24,Cabinet gives approval to upgrading Udupi District Govt. Hospital,"The number of beds to go up to 250 from 124 and staff strength to 195 from 129

In a boost to public health system, the State Cabinet has approved a proposal to construct a new building for the District Government Hospital in Udupi with 126 additional beds. It has also sanctioned 66 additional medical and para-medical staff.

Udupi MLA K. Raghupati Bhat tweeted on Friday that it was a long pending demand of the people of Udupi. He congratulated the Chief Minister and the former and present Minister for Health and Family Welfare for giving approval to the new project in the Cabinet meeting on Thursday.

The approval has been given 23 years after Udupi was carved out of Dakshina Kannada as a district, Mr. Bhat said.

Additional Deputy Commissioner of Udupi B. Sadashiva Prabhu told The Hindu that with this, the total beds in the hospital will go up to 250 from 124. The staff strength will be go up to 195 from 129.

District Surgeon and Medical Superintendent of the hospital Madhusudhan Nayak said that the new proposal, including the cost of building construction, salary of additional staff and some equipment, has been estimated at about ₹ 119 crore. Dr. Nayak said that existing building was constructed in 1961. Later, as the need arose, small extensions were constructed from time to time to add to the structure. Consequently, there are leakages in the roof of the building and maintenance problems as some buildings have concrete roof and others tile roof.

The new building will have an operation theatre complex, laboratory facilities and in-patient wards. When the new building is ready, all facilities will come under a single roof.

However, the present out-patient block, emergency block, geriatric wing (12 beds), burns ward (10 beds), Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) Plus Centre, which were built a few years ago, would remain untouched, Dr. Nayak said.

The old hospital building would be demolished in phases as the new building comes up without hampering medical services.

Udupi district was carved out of Dakshina Kannada in 1997 by combining Udupi and erstwhile Kundapur and Karkala taluks. Though it is called the District Government Hospital, the hospital for all purposes, including infrastructure facilities, remained a taluk hospital.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/dj0w/article32933570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MNHOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/cabinet-gives-approval-to-upgrading-udupi-district-govt-hospital/article32933571.ece
237,2020/10/24,Deadline for filing I-T returns extended till December 31,"The CBDT said the deadlines have been extended in order to “provide more time to taxpayers for furnishing of Income Tax Returns”.

The government has further extended the due date for filing income tax returns for the financial year 2019-20.

For taxpayers who need to get their accounts audited or furnish reports on specific domestic or international transactions, the deadline is now January 31, 2021. For the rest, it has been extended to December 31, 2020 from the earlier deadline of November 30.

The deadline for businesses to file annual Goods and Services Tax returns and reconciliation statements for for the financial year 2018-19, has also been extended from October 31, 2020 to December 31, 2020. The government said it had received a number of pleas for the extension in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, and the GST Council had also recommended that taxpayers be granted more time to comply.

Several chartered accountant bodies had been urging the government to extend the returns filing timelines this year in view of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that led to a national lockdown starting March 24. The government had earlier extended the deadline from July 31 to November 30.

“Further, in order to provide relief to small and middle class taxpayers…the due date for payment of self-assessment tax for the taxpayers whose self-assessment tax liability is up to ₹1 lakh had been extended to November 30, 2020,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes said in a statement on Saturday, adding that these deadlines had been extended again ‘to provide relief for the second time to small and middle class taxpayers.’

The due date for payment of self-assessment tax for these taxpayers has now been extended to January 31, 2021 for those who need to furnish audited accounts or report specified transactions. For the rest, the deadline has been extended to to December 31, 2020.

Consequently, the date for furnishing of various audit reports under the Income Tax Act, including tax audit report and report in respect of international/specified domestic transaction has also been extended to December 31, 2020 from the earlier extended deadline of October 31, 2020.

GST returns

“Government has been receiving a number of representations regarding need to extend due date for filing Annual Return (FORM GSTR-9) and Reconciliation Statement (FORM GSTR-9C) for 2018-19 on the grounds that on account of the COVID-19 pandemic related lockdown and restrictions, normal operation of businesses have still not been possible in several parts of the country. It has been requested that the due dates for the same be extended beyond 31st October 2020 to enable the businesses and auditors to comply in this regard,” the Finance Ministry said.

239,2020/10/24,MPC wary of inflation: minutes,"Policy needs to stay accommodative amid COVID threat to economy: RBI panel

A second wave of COVID-19 remains a threat to the Indian economy and the central bank believes monetary policy needs to remain accommodative despite inflationary pressures, according to the minutes of the monetary policy committee’s latest meeting, released on Friday.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) left interest rates unchanged at that meeting, as expected.

Almost all members of the MPC said they see room for further easing, but a recent rise in price pressures would need to abate for them to use that space.

“This space needs to be used judiciously to support recovery in growth,” RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das wrote in his statement.

Structural reforms to unlock growth are needed but may lack support with growth and employment depressed, Deputy Governor Michael Patra said.

“In the absence of intrinsic drivers, the recovery may last only until pent-up demand has been satiated and replenishment of inventories has been completed,” Dr. Patra said. “Empirical evidence suggests that consumption-led recoveries are shallow and short-lived.”

Dissent note

One of the new external members, Jayanth Varma, added a dissent note as part of his minutes. He agreed with the MPC’s intention to keep policy accommodative during the current financial year and into the next financial year, he said, but he opposed using the word “decided”.

“It appears to me that the steep yield curve reflects a lack of credibility of the MPC’s existing accommodative guidance,” he said, but the MPC was risking making a commitment it might not be able to keep as new data emerges or conditions change. He said he would have preferred to use the word “expected”.

Mr. Varma pointed out the damage inflicted by high long-term interest rates on the economy as policy rates fail to feed through, causing a collapse in investments.

Governor Das said, however, guidance from the central bank would help translate policy rates into longer-term yields and bolster consumption and investment demand.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/5jayek/article32932910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THBURBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/mpc-wary-of-inflation-minutes/article32932911.ece

Jana Small Finance Bank (SFB) is planning to open 200 branches over 18 months, said a top official.

“Recently, we opened our 500th branch in Bengaluru. We will be opening about 100 to 110 branches by March 2021,” said Ajay Kanwal, MD and CEO.

“The next year will see the opening of another 100 branches. While we have already planned for about 110 branches for the current fiscal and another 30-40 branches for the next fiscal, the balance is yet to be finalised,” he said.

According to him, it would cost about ₹20 lakh to open a branch and the funding would be met through internal accruals. Right now, Currently, Jana SFB is presenthas presence in 22 States with a major presence in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka followed by Maharashtra. Most of the branches would come up in tier-II and tier-III cities.

Mr. Kanwal also said the bank was planning to go for an initial public offering (IPO) by March 2021.Preparations were on and the draft red herring prospectus (DHRP) would be filed in the coming months. He also said currently, right now the promoters’ stake stood at held a stake of about 42%.

241,2020/10/24,‘Urban Company’s revenue may double’,"‘Demand higher than pre-COVID level’

Home services aggregator Urban Company, which has onboarded 6,000 service partners over the past two months, is expecting to double its revenue in the current financial year, driven by higher demand for services such as men’s grooming, home cleaning and home painting, than before the pandemic.

“We’ve been fortunate and the business has come back very strongly after the lockdown,” Varun Khaitan, co-founder, Urban Company, said in an interview.

“We are optimistic about the trajectory here onwards as more consumption happens. Consumers will come back to us in even larger numbers, and by the end of the financial year, we hope to be twice of what we were in March, in terms of revenue,” he added. The firm had posted a revenue of ₹216 crore for FY20, a growth of 103% over FY19.

With the onboarding of service providers over the last two months, the total number now stands at about 30,000 in 18 cities.

“This [6,000 service providers], I think, is sizeable and most of these people are those who had lost their previous jobs because their workplace had to shut down. From what we understand, 30-40% offline salons and spas have shut down and may not open,” he said.

He added pre-COVID-19, the platform was providing 7.5 lakh services a month and in October, this number was expected to rise to 9.5 lakh services.

The growth has been driven by services such as appliance repair, home cleaning — which is at almost double the pre-COVID-19 level, home painting — expected to be four times pre-COVID-19 level, men’s grooming and haircuts — which is seven times the pre-COVID-19 level.

“Some of the growth has also been fuelled by the festive demand. The only services which are still catching up are services like women’s beauty and spa massage because understandably, these are very high touch services but still the recovery of these services is much more than one would have anticipated.”

Mr. Khaitan added that Urban Company was spending about ₹4-5 crore on PPEs which were sent out to all service providers every two weeks.

Further, the platform is planning to expand operations in 12 new cities by next summer.

“Internationally, we are good in these three countries [UAE, Australia and Singapore] and will be launching in another new country sometime next year.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/urban-companys-revenue-may-double/article32937514.ece
242,2020/10/24,IL&FS debt resolution misses target,"Firm rolls over ₹7,300-cr. shortfall to coming quarters, says COVID-19 added to logistical complexities

Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) Ltd. on Saturday reported a ₹7,300 crore shortfall in meeting the target for debt resolution by the September quarter citing COVID-19 related issues.

This shortfall is being rolled over for resolution in the subsequent quarters, the company said in a statement.

During the quarter, it could address group debt of only ₹1,460 crore.

“The delay has been mainly caused on account of significant impact of COVID-19, which has added time and logistical complexities in the process of completing discussions with stakeholders and in obtaining approvals from lenders, regulators and judicial authorities,” IL&FS said in the statement.

Stating that as per the update shared in July, the overall debt addressed based on cash balances stood at ₹17,640 crore, it added, “by September, an additional debt of ₹1,460 crore has been addressed by way of sale of education business, recovery from non-IL&FS group entities, increase in cash balances and debt repayment in green entities, increasing the overall debt addressed based on cash balances to ₹19,100 crore.”

The number of entities resolved as of September 2020 stands at 173, or half the original number of 347 entities of the IL&FS Group.

Target for December

As per revised estimates, ₹13,200 crore of additional debt is projected to be addressed by December.

This includes the ₹8,150 crore resolved through the proposed InvIT for which an ‘in-principle’ approval from SEBI had been received.

Further, the time period for resolution of ₹4,200 crore being achieved through debt restructuring has moved from September to December, IL&FS said.

Resolution of ₹10,000 crore, earlier communicated for achievement in Q3 FY21, is being moved, to be achieved in subsequent periods the beleaguered company said.

Estimate unchanged

The management and the new board of IL&FS, however, maintained the earlier estimate of addressing more than 50% of the overall debt, which exceeded ₹99,000 crore as of October 2018.

“The aggregate value of debt being addressed is pegged at ₹56,300 crore — with over ₹50,000 crore likely to be addressed by March 2021,” it said.

The new board of IL&FS has developed a ‘group resolution framework’ that received approval from the NCLAT on March 12.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/xqwvio/article32937503.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25BUILampFS-DEBT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ilfs-debt-resolution-misses-target/article32937504.ece
243,2020/10/24,‘Aircraft carrier trials to begin soon’,"Despite pandemic, Cochin Shipyard has returned to 75% capacity: CMD

October marks a watershed month for Cochin Shipyard Ltd. (CSL), a Mini Ratna PSU, as India’s maiden indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC-I) being built by the company is starting basin trials in preparation for the sea trials and subsequent induction into the Navy.

The shipyard has plans to augment shipbuilding and repair capabilities and to foray into emerging segments such as urban mobility, CMD Madhu S. Nair said in an interview. Excerpts:

What is the status on the aircraft carrier?

Basin trials of the carrier [that displaces 40,000 tonnes] are set to begin this month. This is when its propellers are being turned for the first time using the vessel’s own power. In fact, along with this is the activation of a gamut of allied systems and controls.

For a ship of its size and complexity, it’ll be a major milestone that also signals that the sea trials are not far away. But that depends on a number of factors including the opening up of international travel as commissioning engineers are to arrive from various overseas locations.

How has the firm fared during the pandemic?

Working in two shifts since April, we have been able to return to about 75% of capacity. We have orders worth ₹14,000 crore. Last year, we bagged an order from the Jindal group for four mini bulk carriers and another from the Union Home Ministry for nine floating border outposts for the BSF. Then the pandemic struck, but we were able to get this order for autonomous vessels from Norway.

From a value point of view, it’s just about ₹125 crore, but this contract, signed amidst the pandemic in July, is significant for us because of its technology and because it offers us a strong learning curve. We think there’s a market in India for boats and vessels that aren’t very large but where technology will stand out.

With appropriate partnerships, we can build for the world too. This autonomous vessel, for instance, was developed by Kongsberg Maritime in Norway. It has a 1,800 KWh battery system and it is not easy to integrate and prove such systems in a marine environment. We are already building hybrid electric ferries for the Kochi Water Metro.

Have your off-campus ventures begun to look up?

The ship repair facility in Mumbai, in the dock leased from the port trust, had done well last year doing business worth ₹55 crore. We were bolstering the infrastructure when the pandemic hit the city hard, which hit our work too. It’s just a matter of time before it gets into a stable phase, though.

In Kolkata, unlike Mumbai, there was no developed ship repair ecosystem. But it was better than what we expected. We are handling the fifth project there now, a dredger of the DCI. In Port Blair, there are people on ground, but the COVID-19 situation remains bad which will further delay the maiden project by a few months.

These apart, we have taken over Tebma Shipyard in Karnataka and are going to build some fishing vessels there. We want to begin operations in January, 2021, and are in the process of recruiting hands. The Hooghly Cochin Shipyard in Kolkata where we intend to build inland vessels should be ready for commissioning by the end of this year or early next.

What does the shipyard’s strategic plan for 2030 comprise ?

It’s an ongoing evolutionary vision plan called CRUISE 2030 prepared in collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group. It’s multi-pronged and is intended to strengthen our core areas of shipbuilding and repair and to venture into adjacencies and emerging spheres targeting manifold growth. Construction of smaller, hi-tech platforms to contribute to sustainable, modern urban mobility, to cite an instance. And the orders are in large numbers.

Also part of the long-term strategy are systems to improve internal efficiencies, to unlock value. It’s some time since we have introduced full digital movement of files.

Now we are creating a digital centre of excellence in which various things are looked at: maybe a chat bot to assist, a handheld app to guide contractors and people’s entry into the shipyard etc.

Sensor-based tracking of material movement, digital access control and the like are all being looked at. The processes are being digitally realigned. Concurrently, we have just replaced a 25-year-old life cycle management platform, a benchmark then, with a new manufacturing excellence system developed by Dassault Systems, which will also interlink all processes.

As part of your infrastructure expansion, there’s this large dry dock being built in Kochi and an international ship repair facility (ISRF) on land owned by the Cochin Port Trust. Are these projects on schedule?

Both were moving fast. We had a predominantly migrant labour force and the pandemic slowed down the work, as social distancing protocols and the ban on working at night kicked in. But we are hopeful of completing the ISRF by the end of 2021 and the dry dock in the latter part of 2022.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/t7ox5w/article32937452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25BUMADHUSNAIRCOCHINSHIPYARD,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/aircraft-carrier-trials-to-begin-soon/article32937453.ece
244,2020/10/24,Loan interest waiver to be credited by November 5,"Scheme will be implemented even for borrowers who did not avail moratorium.

Three weeks after informing the Supreme Court that the Centre would bear the additional compound interest on loans of up to ₹2 crore availed by retail borrowers as well as micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), the government formally communicated the modalities of the scheme to lenders on Friday.

Banks and other lenders, including co-operative banks and non-banking finance companies, have been asked to credit the difference between the compound interest and simple interest for the six month period between March 1 and August 31 into these loan accounts by November 5. This would be implemented even for borrowers who had not availed the moratorium on loan repayments allowed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) up to August 31.

At its last hearing on October 14, the Supreme Court had turned down the Centre’s request for a month to implement a scheme to ensure that borrowers with loans of up to ₹2 crore won’t have to bear compound interest on the interest dues accruing on their loans during the moratorium period.

The apex court, which had been hearing petitions seeking an extension of the six month moratorium granted by the RBI on loan repayments, had given the Centre time till November 2 and said “the common man’s Diwali is now in the government’s hands”.

“In view of the unprecedented and extreme COVID-19 situation, the object of the scheme is to provide ex-gratia payment of difference between compound interest and simple interest by ways of relief for the period from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020, to borrowers in specified loan accounts,” the Finance Ministry said in its communique laying out the scheme’s contours.

The scheme shall be applicable for loans availed by MSMEs as well as loans to retail customers for education, housing, consumer durables, automobiles, provided an individual borrower has an aggregate outstanding loan of ₹2 crore or less, from all such loans. Credit card dues have also been included in the scheme’s ambit.

The ex-gratia payment shall be admissible, irrespective of whether the borrower had availed the moratorium partly, fully, or not at all, the Ministry said. However, this would only be permitted for loan accounts that had not been reported as non-performing assets as on February 29. A loan is recorded as a non-performing asset or NPA, 90 days after repayments become overdue.

A mechanism has been put in place for banks to claim the amount back from the government, as per the missive sent on Friday to the RBI , National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and all other financing institutions. Lenders have to submit claims for reimbursement by December 15 through a special cell set up in the State Bank of India (SBI).

Lenders have been asked to set up a grievance redressal mechanism for eligible borrowers under the scheme within a week, keeping in mind the guidance issued by the Indian Banks’ Association regarding the resolution framework for COVID-19 related stress.

For resolving grievances of the lenders while implementing the scheme, the dedicated cell for the scheme in SBI will work in tandem with the Finance Ministry.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/3taz2h/article32284783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-bribe-money-counting-cash-counter-graft-charge-bribery,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/centre-lays-out-modalities-of-compound-interest-scheme-on-loans-up-to-2-crore/article32936609.ece

In a relief to borrowers at the onset of the festive season, the government on late Friday night announced waiver of interest on interest for loans up to ₹2 crore irrespective of whether moratorium was availed or not.

The Department of Financial Services came out with operational guidelines in the backdrop of Supreme Court’s direction to implement the interest waiver scheme, which is likely to cost the exchequer ₹6,500 crore.

The apex court on October 14 directed the Centre to implement “as soon as possible” interest waiver on loans of up to ₹2 crore under the RBI moratorium scheme in view of the COVID-19 pandemic saying the common man’s Deepavali is in the government’s hands.

As per the guidelines, the scheme can be availed by borrowers in specified loan accounts for a period from March 1 to August 31, 2020.

“Borrowers who have loan accounts having sanctioned limits and outstanding amount of not exceeding ₹2 crore (aggregate of all facilities with lending institutions) as on February 29 shall be eligible for the scheme,” it said.

As per the eligibility criteria mentioned in the guidelines, the accounts should be standard as on February 29 which means that it should not be Non-Performing Asset (NPA).

Housing loan, education loans, credit card dues, auto loans, MSME loans, consumer durable loans and consumption loans are covered under the scheme.

As per the scheme, the lending institutions shall credit the difference between compound interest and simple interest with regard to the eligible borrowers in respective accounts for the said period irrespective of whether the borrower fully or partially availed the moratorium on repayment of loan announced by the RBI on March 27, 2020.

The scheme is also applicable on those who have not availed the moratorium scheme and continued with the repayment of loans.

Pricing for Chinese fintech giant Ant Group's giant dual-listing was determined on Friday night, Alibaba founder Jack Ma said on Saturday.

It is the first time pricing of the initial public offering, which sources have said could be a world record $35 billion, has been determined outside New York, he told the Bund Summit in the eastern financial hub of Shanghai.

Backed by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, Ant plans to list simultaneously in Hong Kong and on Shanghai's STAR Market in the coming weeks.

The listing could be the world's largest initial public offering, surpassing the record set by Saudi Aramco's $29.4 billion float last December. The IPO would also be the first simultaneous listing in Hong Kong and on the year-old STAR Market in Shanghai.

Ant was set to conduct price consultations for the Shanghai offering on Oct. 23 and will set the price on Oct. 26, according to its updated prospectus filed with the local exchange.

For the Hong Kong leg, Ant plans to open order books next week. Its shares are likely to start trading a few days after the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, sources have said.

247,2020/10/24,Metrics of world happiness and the Muslims of India,"In an age of majoritarianism, the RSS chief’s recent statement could help reassure the community of its standing

Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat has again reiterated his oft-repeated statement that the happiest Muslims in the world are in India. But for the Muslims of India, a comparison to Islamic countries is of no relevance at all. In any case, India should compare itself with the Scandinavian countries rather than some of the regressive Muslim regimes. Indian Muslims will be more concerned about the health of Indian democracy and how far the country is upholding or violating the high values enshrined in the Constitution.

Importantly, Mr. Bhagwat. in a clear departure from the Hindutva stand, has asserted that the Constitution nowhere says only Hindus can live in India, or that to live in India one has to accept the supremacy of Hindus. He has also tried to demolish the Hindutva theory of Muslim rule being exclusively Muslim rule by citing the battle of Haldighati (1576) between the Mughals and Rajputs when, he said, many Muslims were on the side of Maharana Pratap Singh and fought against the Mughal army led by another Rajput, Raja Man Singh.

Mr. Bhagwat has repeatedly said that Muslims are equal citizens of this country while Hindutva has been historically making a distinction between indigenous religions and Abrahamic religions. His statement of Hindus not having any superior status in the Constitution is not only consistent with the vision of the Constitution but also signifies abandoning the idea of declaring India as a Hindu Rashtra. Though a welcome departure from the stated position, one should not overnight expect a break from the past on every issue. Any change in the long-held position of the organisation can only be gradual.

How do we assess happiness? In the eighth World Happiness Report of 2020 released in March, India is ranked 144 out of 153 countries. The first five ranks go to Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Iceland and Norway, respectively. Even India’s neighbours are ahead — Bangladesh (107), Sri Lanka (130), Nepal (92) and Pakistan (66). The unhappiest people are in Afghanistan (153), South Sudan (152), Zimbabwe (151), Rwanda (150) and the Central African Republic (149).

Key concerns in the country

The variables taken into account include general well-being; positive emotions; supplemental life; circumstances and social environment; inequalities; unemployment; low incomes; discrimination; GDP per capita; life expectancy; freedom; generosity and absence of corruption. In India, with 45-year high unemployment rates (prior to COVID-19) and over 12.2 crore people losing jobs during the lockdown phase, more Indians (not just Muslims) are today worried and unhappy than ever before. Dalits face rising atrocities against them, farmers are unhappy about the enactment of new farm laws, labour unions are disappointed with the new Labour Code and civil society activists are frustrated over the denial of civil liberties, latest FCRA Amendment and the judiciary’s reluctance to even promptly hear habeas corpus petitions.

Coming back to the Report, most Muslims elsewhere seem happier than Indian Muslims — the United Arab Emirates (21); Saudi Arabia (27); Bahrain (40); Kuwait (48); Libya (80) and Malaysia (82). True, Indian Muslims are certainly better off than Muslims in several Muslim countries due to India’s liberal, egalitarian and secular Constitution and Hinduism’s tolerance. Most Muslim countries are not really democratic and therefore should not be compared with India.

In the recently released World Hunger Index-2020, India ranks 94 out of 107 countries; Pakistan (88) and Bangladesh (75) are ahead. Both Kuwait and Turkey are in the top 17. Other rankings are Tunisia (23); Saudi Arabia (35); Iran (39) and Jordan (43).

On civil liberties

Civil liberties are an important component too in ensuring contentment. India’s rankings should worry the RSS chief. In the World Freedom of Press Index-2020, India was ranked 142 out of 180 countries. Several Muslim countries are ahead — Bosnia-Herzegovina (58); Kosovo (70); Tunisia (72) and Malaysia (101).

In the World Justice Project Rule of Law Index, it is a grim situation for India (a global rank of 69 out of 128 countries). Factors such as constraints on governmental power; open government; fundamental rights; order and security, absence of corruption; regulatory enforcement; civil justice system and criminal justice system matter. With verdicts such as the acquittal of all the accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case, India’s rank is unlikely to improve in 2021. Once again, several Muslim countries are ahead even in the rule of law — the UAE (30); Malaysia (47); Jordon (50); Tunisia (56); Indonesia (59) and Kazakhstan (62). Happiness is also closely related to the state of rule of law. Increasingly, faith in the rule of law is diminishing with some courts becoming more executive minded than the executive itself.

Religious freedom

Finally, on freedom of religion, the Indian Constitution grants this freedom to everyone including Muslims, yet its definition of the term Hindu is problematic and is criticised by Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists. A denial of Scheduled Caste status to Muslims and Dalit Christians by Presidential order is seen to be discriminatory. Anti-conversion laws of many States require the prior permission of district officials for conversion. Religion being a purely private matter, the state should have no concern with it. Charging protesters against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens with offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and alleging so-called ‘UPSC jihad’ do have a deleterious effect on the emotional health of Muslims, with a predominant feeling of being unwanted and alienation.

Even on religious freedom, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has downgraded India’s ranking in its 2020 report. It is scathing when it says, “India took a sharp downward turn in 2019. The national government used its strengthened parliamentary majority to institute national-level policies violating religious freedom across India, especially for Muslims.” Strangely, Afghanistan, Sudan, Indonesia and Egypt have better rankings, while India has been clubbed with Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, North Korea, Syria, Burma and China (‘Countries of Particular Concern’). The International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA) defines CPCs as “countries where the government engages in or tolerates ‘particularly severe’ violations of religious freedom.” Under U.S. law, these include violations such as ‘torture, degrading treatment, prolonged detention without charges and other fragrant denial of right to life, liberty or the security of persons’.

The RSS chief is also not right in saying that in no other society does an alien religion still survive. Europe, the Americas, Australia and Africa have Christianity that originated in Jerusalem. Buddhism, from India, is present in a number of countries. Islam, from Saudi Arabia, is strong in several European, African and Asian states, and Australia.

The RSS chief’s statement that Indian Muslims are the happiest lot of Muslims may not be completely true but it would certainly have the much-needed calming effect in assuring Muslims of their rightful and equal claim to India as their country. In an age of majoritarianism, Mr. Bhagwat can certainly help restore sanity, tolerance and accommodation which were essential attributes of classical Hinduism. He should rein in aggressive Hindutva forces and convince them about the values of diversity and the remarkable contribution that Muslims have made to Indian civilisation.

248,2020/10/24,Taking on the Centre: On States rejecting farm laws,"States aggrieved by central farm laws are adopting both legislative and legal measures

Punjab’s efforts to enact State amendments to override the effects of the Centre’s new agriculture laws epitomise the difficulties in managing the conflict between liberalising the farm sector and protecting the small and marginal farmer from the agonies of the transition. The issue also flags the consequences of not having a wide and informed debate before introducing far-reaching changes. Punjab has been the hub of the opposition to the Centre’s legislative exercise to change the basics of trade and commerce in agriculture. The Akali Dal, the main opposition in the State, eventually withdrew its Cabinet minister and later walked out of the NDA government at the Centre. Punjab argues that the central Acts would cause “grave detriment and prejudice” to agricultural communities. The Bills cite an agriculture census of 2015-16 to argue that 86.2% of farmers own less than five acres — a majority of them less than two acres — and that with limited or no access to multiple markets, they would be handicapped while negotiating fair price contracts with private players. Making efforts to buy farm produce at less than the MSP or harassing farmers in a bid to persuade them to enter into such contracts have been sought to be made punishable offences, with a jail term of at least three years. The Bills also seek to overturn the Centre’s move to remove the fee on trade and transactions that take place outside markets functioning under APMCs.

A key issue raised by Punjab’s proposed amendments is whether they are legally valid and where they stand in the teeth of the Centre’s legislation. States can indeed amend central laws enacted under the Concurrent List, subject to the condition that provisions repugnant to the parliamentary Acts will have to get the President’s assent, without which they do not come into force. The Punjab Bills note that agriculture is under the legislative domain on the States, as the subject falls under the State List in the Seventh Schedule. The Centre has enacted its farm sector Bills by invoking Entry 33(b) in the Concurrent List, which concerns trade and commerce in, and production, supply and distribution of, “foodstuffs”. By stretching the entry’s meaning to include agriculture, Parliament has managed to pass laws in the domain of the States. In these circumstances, States aggrieved by the farm sector laws will either have to go the Punjab way to adopt Bills that would require presidential assent, as Rajasthan has decided to do, or challenge the validity of the central laws in the Supreme Court, as Chhattisgarh is said to be considering. Whatever the outcome, clear from the groundswell of opposition across the country is that a cavalier and centralised approach to issues that affect millions of farmers ill-serves a diverse country.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/taking-on-the-centre-the-hindu-editorial-on-states-rejecting-farm-laws/article32932897.ece
249,2020/10/24,Hitting where it hurts: On U.S. B-1 business visa curbs,"As the U.S. election nears, work visas have become policy targets for the White House

The Trump administration has once again tightened the screws on the country’s immigration system in a manner that is likely to directly impact Indian companies contracting with American firms for on-site work. This week the State Department proposed to stop issuing temporary or B-1 business visas relating to occupations normally classified as falling under the H-1B speciality or skilled visa category. The argument is that under the guise of the business-related entry of personnel, companies were sending their technology professionals for short-term stays to work on U.S. jobs, potentially undercutting the wages and employment prospects of U.S. workers. The proposed policy action, just ahead of the November 3 presidential election, is significant for following closely on the heels of other, similar moves to tighten restrictions on the entry of foreign nationals, including raising the minimum salaries payable to those applying for H-1B visas and to stop the issuance of such visas entirely until December 31, 2020. Taken together, it would be reasonable to expect a painful economic fallout on legal skilled migration from India. For example, the analysts predict that Mr. Trump’s June 22, 2020 ban on new H-1B visa issuance could impact up to 219,000 workers, who would be unable to take up potential jobs in the U.S.

To date, there has been no retaliatory policy from India, at most perhaps diplomatic parleys where South Block has sought to emphasise that technology and innovation via the trade in services remain a key pillar of the bilateral strategic partnership and highly-skilled Indian professionals working in the U.S. help bridge the skill gap there, imparting a technological and competitive edge. In the backdrop of the steady clampdown on visa issuance is Mr. Trump’s rhetoric on protecting U.S. jobs from foreigners, especially in cases where lower wages drive substitution effects. The pressure on the White House to increase the cadence of the drumbeat for this form of “protectionism” has risen owing to the pandemic’s job-killing effects. U.S. joblessness spiked to an unprecedented 14.7% in April 2020. While it has dropped off since then, the country has entered the final phases of electoral campaigning, which has seen sharp attacks by Democratic challenger Joe Biden on Mr. Trump’s alleged failure to mitigate the economic crisis. When considered alongside the fact that Mr. Trump is steadily losing ground in federal and regional opinion polls, it is hardly surprising that areas of legal migration, including skilled workers entering the U.S. via the H-1B programme, have become policy targets for the White House. It would be wise for Indian IT firms and others seeking to send their employees to the U.S. for short-term work to assume that regardless of who wins the election, it will be a long time, if ever, before they can hope to return to business as usual.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hitting-where-it-hurts-the-hindu-editorial-on-us-b-1-business-visa-curbs/article32932898.ece
250,2020/10/24,Guard robbed of his savings at knifepoint,"A guard, who was on his way to a bank to send money to his ailing mother in Assam, was robbed at Fraser Town on Friday.

According to the police, the victim, Patras Guriya, who is in his late 20s, hails from Assam and has been working as a guard in the city since 2012. He was posted at an apartment complex near Coles Park. His mother was recently hospitalised back home in Assam. Patras pooled his savings, took a few loans, and managed to put together ₹27,000. “However, while on his way to deposit the money in his mother’s bank account, he was robbed at knifepoint,” said a police officer.

A gang of four youths surrounded him, threatened him with a knife, and robbed him of his money. The police suspect that the someone who knew about Patras collecting money may have been behind the robbery.

252,2020/10/24,Government and aided school students in Karnataka not given dry rations since June,"When schools closed due to COVID-19 in March and midday meals were stopped, the State government provided dry ration kits till May

Lakhs of students in government and aided schools have been deprived of dry ration kits since June. When schools closed because of COVID-19 in March and midday meals were stopped, the State government provided ration kits that included rice and toor dal for three months till May.

However, it has not distributed rations to students for five months from June to October.

Around 48 lakh children from classes 1 to 10 depend on the midday meals and a majority of them come from lower socio-economic backgrounds and marginalised communities.

Siddharth Joshi, an independent researcher with the Aahara Namma Hakku, Karnataka, filed a RTI application with the Department of Public Instruction to find out the months when dry rations were provided and the reasons for not doing so in certain months. “The midday meals’ office forwarded the query to district offices to respond. Officials from two districts[Tumakuru and Kolar] have told us that they gave dry rations till the end of May,” he said.

Dry ration kits have not been distributed in other districts too. V. Anbu Kumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction, said that they were waiting for a government order in this regard. “I have learnt that the order is almost ready. As soon it is issued, we will distribute rations for June and July. A proposal for the subsequent months has also been sent to the government,” he said.

Activists, however, pointed out that the delay has already affected students who depended on the midday meals and the ration kits.

Manjunath S., an auto driver whose two children study in a government primary school in Bengaluru, said, “I had no steady source of income in the last two months. I am able to provide only two meals a day for my children. If the school had provided rations, it would have taken care of the food requirements of my children.”

The midday meal is a right under the National Food Security Act. “The Ministry of Human Resource Development too had instructed State governments and Union Territories to ensure that they either provide hot meals or give food security allowance comprising food grains and cooking costs to eligible children for the duration,” said Mr. Joshi.

Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor, said that there is an urgent need to ensure that the rations are supplied to children as there is a nutrition crisis among several families, which have been pushed into poverty owing to the pandemic. “The government should provide oil, milk powder, and eggs to meet the nutritional demand of children,” she added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/government-and-aided-school-students-in-karnataka-not-given-dry-rations-since-june/article32936999.ece
253,2020/10/24,"Over 600 sites sold in auction, BDA mops up ₹610 crore revenue","240 sites remain to be auctioned

The recent auction of sites by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) saw over 600 sites sold, giving a boost to the cash-strapped agency’s coffers.

BDA Commissioner H.R. Mahadev told The Hindu that e-auctioning of the sites, which were done in a phased manner since July, saw 672 sites sold of the 912 auctioned. As many as 240 sites remain to be auctioned.

According to BDA data, the auction saw gradual improvement in response: in the July auction 162 of the 202 auctioned sites were sold; in August, 228 of the 308 auctioned sites were sold, and in the third phase in September, 282 of the 402 auctioned sites were sold.

“We will get around ₹610 crore from this. Some are yet to get the sites registered. But they have 45 days after bidding,” Mr. Mahadev added.

The auctioning came months after Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced that BDA sites would be auctioned as an additional source of revenue for the State government. e-auctions were held for sites in HSR Layout, Sir M. Visvesvaraya Layout, Banashankari, NGEF, J.P. Nagar, and Rajajinagar, among others.

The cost of a site ranged from ₹36,000 per sq.m to ₹1.6 lakh per sq.m, depending on the location. The BDA had said it had fixed 1.5 times the guidance value as the price for sites located in the layouts formed before 2000, and 1.2 times the guidance value for the layouts formed after 2000.

Public could participate in the e-auction to purchase sites. Geo-mapping was implemented on the BDA website for auctioned sites to enable bidders to view locations.

Earlier, the BDA had tried to generate revenue by auctioning sites to fund civil infrastructure projects. More recently, its decision of selling over 1,400 civic amenity (CA) sites, currently leased to private and government bodies, in and around the city had attracted objection from citizens and activists.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/over-600-sites-sold-in-auction-bda-mops-up-610-crore-revenue/article32936988.ece
254,2020/10/24,No demand for KSRTC buses this Dasara,"The Corporation received only 10,000 online bookings compared to nearly 60,000 this time last year

Last year, during the Dasara season, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) operated more than 3,000 additional services that helped generate over ₹10 crore extra revenue. This year, with most people either staying at home or using personal vehicles to travel to their home-towns to minimise the risk of contracting COVID-19, there has been no demand.

“Every year, during the Dasara season, on the last four days, people usually go to their native place in large numbers. However, this time, there is no such rush. Till Friday evening, there was no demand for additional buses. Online ticket booking for regular services is not very promising,” said a KSRTC official.

As on Friday, there were 10,000 online bookings. Last year, online bookings alone touched 60,000.

Even inter-State travel has failed to pick up. “Prior to the lockdown, we re operating more than 400 services to Tamil Nadu alone. These services are yet to resume. There used to be higher demand for Vijayawada, Hyderabad and other destinations during the festive season, especially for the premier segment of services. That is not the case now,” the official added.

To improve occupancy, the Corporation decided not to levy an additional 10% charge for weekend bookings, but the incentive has done little to increase ticket sales.

Traditional destinations like Mysuru, too, are not attracting people. Officials attribute this to the fact that Dasara in Mysuru is a low-key affair this year. During the festive season, KSRTC would operate an additional 200 services to Mysuru alone.

Meanwhile, the South Western Railways (SWR) recently announced that it will be operating 58 special trains to various destinations, and majority of them are from Bengaluru. An official of the SWR said, “The special train services will operate till November-end. Booking has started, but the travel demand and patterns can be analysed only after a few days.” said an official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dijzp4/article32931551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGKSRTCP3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/no-demand-for-ksrtc-buses-this-festive-season/article32931552.ece
255,2020/10/24,City to get 50 transfer stations to improve waste management,"Waste collected from households will be transferred into portable compactors for transportation to waste processing plants

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has plans to establish 50 transfer stations where municipal solid waste collected from households can be directly dumped into portable compactors to be transported to waste processing plants.

After launching operations of a transfer station on New BEL Road on Friday along with BBMP Administrator Gaurav Gupta, civic chief N. Manjunath Prasad said that five transfer stations were ready. The formal inauguration will be scheduled after the by-polls.

He said the transfer stations will help maintain visual cleanliness, reduce black spots, avoid dripping of leachate, reduce manual handling of waste, besides help reduce number of trips to processing plants. “Auto tippers can directly dump waste into the compactor, which compresses it (waste) to 50% of its capacity. The leachate is drained into a tank and later transported to the processing plant for safe disposal,” he said.

Land is the major hurdle in setting up the remaining transfer stations. The civic body, Mr. Prasad said, had sought land from the Bangalore Development Authority. “The BDA has submitted a list of CA sites, which we are examining for suitability to set up similar facilities,” he said.

Earlier, both Mr. Gupta and Mr. Prasad inspected the MSGP processing facility that receives around 500 tonnes of mixed waste. The officials were directed to ensure that segregated waste is also sent to the facility, along with mixed waste, besides ensuring that the facility is maintained properly as per the SOP, and communities living around are not inconvenienced in any way.

The compost generated at the facility is bagged and sent to the Agriculture Department. Farmers can directly procure the compost from the processing facility, according to a release.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/city-to-get-50-transfer-stations-to-improve-waste-management/article32932906.ece
256,2020/10/24,Traffic police intensify drive against motorists performing wheelies,"Book over 14 cases, and they are trying to track down habitual offenders

The police on Friday extended their drive against defective silencers and motorcyclists performing wheelies and other stunts across the city. Over 14 cases were booked by the traffic police who are trying to track down habitual offenders.

As per the new rule, first-time offenders will be made to submit an undertaking before the jurisdictional Deputy Commissioners of Police, along with a bond under Section 107 of the CrPC (Code of Criminal Procedure). If they are caught again for the same offence, the police can slap a fine of ₹50,000 for using defective silencers and ₹2 lakh for performing bike stunts.

“Performing stunts on bikes endangers life and is a criminal offence under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Indian Penal Code. We will intensify the drive in the coming days so that it will act as a deterrent,” said Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, adding that if offenders do not pay the penalty, they are liable to undergo imprisonment between six months and one year.

Residents and activists have welcomed the move, but many pointed out that the high fines would only promote corruption among police personnel. “There is a danger of this increasing corrupt practices and also clashes between the police and motorists,” said advocate and social activist Narasimhamurthy.

Traffic expert M.N. Sreehari said that the enforcement agency should focus on a holistic approach rather than launching special drives. “These activities are observed among the young crowd who are influenced by ads on TV and social media,” he said, and suggested that awareness campaigns should also be conducted.

“Enforcement agencies, including traffic and Transport Department officials, should issue notices to the vehicle manufacturing companies to stop advertising bike races and bike stunts to promote their products,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/traffic-police-intensify-drive-against-motorists-performing-wheelies/article32932923.ece
257,2020/10/24,College reopening: Online class option leads to confusion,"Teachers say it will increase workload; students feel they may miss portions

College principals, teachers and students are waiting for more clarity from the government after it announced on Friday that classes will resume on November 17. What has got everyone puzzled is the decision to not make physical attendance mandatory. Barring practicals where attendance is compulsory, students will have the option of continuing with online classes. “Does this mean that we have to conduct online classes as well,” asked a teacher.

Teachers are worried that it will increase their workload. A professor from a government college in Bengaluru said there would be confusion and lack of uniformity. “Should we record the class for online students and upload it separately or will the recording be done as and when the offline classes are going on?” the professor said.

K.R. Venugopal, vice-chancellor, Bangalore University, said they were waiting for the detailed guidelines from the government. “Based on that, we will issue guidelines to colleges affiliated to our university and make arrangements for reopening colleges,” he said.

Students, too, are worried about missing out on some key part of the portion if the online and offline classes are not the same. “I do not know how colleges will ensure that one set of students won’t have an advantage over another. This system will not create a level playing field and lead to inequality in terms access,” said a law student from private college.

However, the government’s decision to resume practicals has come as a relief to students,who have suggested that this rule should be expanded to chapters dealing with difficult concepts. “There are some subjects that have concepts which cannot be taught and learnt online. Such topics can be completed with students in class, and the rest can be online,” said another student.

Welcoming the move, T.M. Manjunatha, president, Karnataka Government College Teachers’ Association, said colleges should take all the necessary precautions to make campuses safe. “The government should ensure that SOPs are strictly adhered to by colleges keeping in mind the health and safety of students and teachers,” he said.

Some student organisations have opposed the decision of the Government to reopen colleges after Deepavali. H.M. Sithara, Bengaluru district president, All India Democratic Students' Organisation (AIDSO), said that the government was in a hurry to re-open education institutions just to normalise the situation.

“It is the duty and responsibility of the Government to first issue astute guidelines on reopening colleges and then announce the decision. Here, they have announced the decision but there are no guidelines or SOPs. This has created confusion and panic among students and teachers,” she said. She also urged the government to resume offline classes only after the pandemic had subsided.

Autonomous institutions like Christ (Deemed to be University), St. Joseph’s College of Arts and Science, will hold their semester exams in November-December where students will be given the choice to either write the exam online or offline.

Abraham V.M., V-C of Christ (Deemed to be University), said, “We have resumed offline classes partially, but only for practicals sessions for PG and PhD students.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/vb751v/article32935011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGBUP4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/college-reopening-online-class-option-leads-to-confusion/article32935012.ece

The School Education Department has asked the government and aided schools to gear up for student admissions on Vijayadasami day, October 26.

The Director of Elementary Education has instructed all Chief Educational Officers to ensure that schools are prepared to begin the admission process.

In a circular, A.Karuppaswamy, Director, elementary education, said that government schools should create awareness by displaying details regarding the admission process by placing boards near the school. Parent, teacher associations have also been asked to reach out to prospective parents in case they have any queries.

Children who are five years of age in Anganwadis will also be identified and directed to be enrolled in government schools. Teachers and school heads will also be creating awareness in the localities around the school, so that children who are five years and older in that area can be enrolled into the school.

260,2020/10/24,"Communal forces responsible for cases against Thirumavalavan, says Alagiri","His speech gave further strength to Periyar and Ambedkar’s condemnation of the portrayal of women as depicted in the Manusmriti, the TNCC president said.

TNCC president K.S. Alagiri on Saturday said secular forces in Tamil Nadu will stand with VCK president Thol. Thirumavalavan and communal forces were responsible for the cases filed against him for speaking on the role of women according to the Manusmriti.

Mr. Alagiri said the BJP-RSS and communal forces were twisting Mr. Thirumavalavan’s statement and were engaged in defaming him.

“Thirumavalavan’s speech gave further strength to Periyar and Ambedkar’s condemnation of the portrayal of women as depicted in the Manusmriti. The ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, which calls itself a Dravidian party, is acting in cahoots with the communal forces and filed cases against Thirumavalavan.

261,2020/10/24,Friends gift ‘expensive’ onions for wedding,"A couple was pleasantly shocked when their friends gifted them three kilograms of onions — whose prices have sky-rocketed off late — for their wedding reception held in Ponneri on Friday.

Sheeba Suvitha, from Tiruvottiyur, works as a nurse in the Ponneri Government Hospital. She was earlier working in the Government RSRM Hospital in Royapuram. On Friday morning, she got married to Senthil Kumar, an engineer, at a marriage hall in Arani near Ponneri.

On Friday evening, a wedding reception was also organised for the couple. Many guests gave them gifts and congratulated the couple. “My friends from RSRM hospital - Hemalatha, Bharathi, Atulya and Ezhilarasi, Mohana and Raji from Ponneri Government Hospital also gave me a gift. It was packed like a bouquet and had a bow on top. Initially I thought it had flowers but I was shocked to find onions,” says Ms. Sheeba, who added that her husband was also amused.

Since the couple was on the stage, they could not react. “After the function, I laughed my guts out,” adds Ms. Sheeba.

J. Hemalatha, one of the friends, who works as a counsellor in Government RSRM Hospital, said that on Friday after the marriage everyone was discussing the price of onions. “It had touched ₹125 per kilo. We decided to give three kilograms and purchased it from a shop. We packed it well and gifted it.”

Ms. Hemalatha said that more than the couple, their families were amused. “In a lighter vein they asked why they did not get some for them. They added that it was a very useful gift considering the current price of onions,” said Ms. Hemalatha, adding that the gift will remain etched in the memory of the couple and their families.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xj0tig/article32935997.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/onion-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/friends-gift-expensive-onions-for-wedding/article32935994.ece
262,2020/10/24,RWA seeks removal of water hyacinths from Velachery lake,"In August, GCC carried out a clean-up drive

Annai Indira Nagar Residents Welfare Association in Velachery has requested the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) and Public Works Department (PWD) to clear the water hyacinths and grass that the Velachery lake are now overrun with.

“The Corporation did carry out a cleaning exercise in the lake in August with an aquatic weed-cutting boat that helps cut underwater weeds. However, the hyacinths have cropped up again and spread all over the lake. They have not not spared the drains either — through these drains, excess water flows from the lake into the Pallikaranai Marsh and the Buckingham canal. If this North-East monsoon is going to witness rains, the localities around the lake will be under sheets of water. So, representing the association, I have sent a telephonic message to the Corporation officials, PWD officials and our elected representatives asking them to attend to this. Besides, the Corporation should take measures to arrest discharge of sewage into the lake. That alone will provide a lasting solution in checking the growth of the water hyacinths. In addition to contaminating the lake, sewage nourishes the water hyacinths,” says S. Kumararaja, an office-bearer of the Association.

The Association also pointed out that the stormwater drain on Link Road which runs along Taramani MRTS station to Perungudi MRTS is yet to be desilted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5hv3yt/article32935758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25dcadyr-Velachery-Lake,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rwa-seeks-removal-of-water-hyacinths-from-velachery-lake/article32935759.ece
263,2020/10/24,The battle for Esa Eri rages,"Garbage is being continually dumped in the lake with impunity, say Pudupakkam residents

On September 28 this year, Jasraj Nagar and Sai Baba Nagar Residents Welfare Association in Pudupakkam got a reply to its RTI petition that a small piece of land in Pudupakkam village has been identified for dumping garbage. The details about this land have also been clearly spelt out, leaving no room for any ambiguity. But the ground reality is that waste is still being dumped in Esa Eri, a lake in the region.

The Association has therefore made a request to the Chengalpet District Collectorate seeking that steps be taken immediately to stop the dumping of garbage in the waterbody and save it.

A. Devananth, the Association president, says, “We have been taking up this issue for the past many years. In March 2018, we submitted a petition to the Kancheepuram District Collectorate to prevent dumping of garbage in the lake and for removal of the encroachments in the waterbody. The petition was forwarded by the Collectorate to Thiruporur Tahsildarto take action under State Government Order No:540. Further, at the Grama Sabha meeting held on May 1, 2018, we submitted a petition to the Pudupakkam Village Panchayat, to identify a space to segregate the waste. The Panchayat passed a resolution in this regard. These things were submitted to the Kancheepuram District Collectorate (that was before the bifurcation of the district), seeking that it take necessary steps from its side. But, no action has been taken by the Collectorate. Besides, we sent petitions to the Collectorate seeking further action. We have not received any reply from the Collectorate.”

Devananth continues: “Therefore, the Association filed an RTI petition, dated July 25, 2019, with the State Information Commission, seeking to know why there is a delay in identifying a land for source segregation. We also sought to know why the encroachments have not been removed. Only last month we got a reply that land has been identified for dumping waste. However, we find waste being dumped in the lake.”

Devananth draws attention to another issue: “The waste pile-ups are set to fire. Therefore, we are unable to keep our doors and windows open. Smoke engulfs our neighbouhood. In addition, we face the menace of flies and mosquitoes.”

Efforts to contact the authorities at Chengalpet District Collectorate evoked no response.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5goyyx/article32935725.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25dcadyr-Sty-Pudhupakkam-Garbage,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/the-battle-for-esa-eri-rages/article32935729.ece
264,2020/10/24,Poonamallee roads under the scanner,"As Poonamallee figures in a list of 65 accident-prone sections of Chennai, an initiative called “Adopting A Road” is being introduced across the locality

Select roads and traffic spots in Poonamallee would receive greater attention from the Poonamallee traffic police, as part of a pan-Chennai initiative launched by City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal a fortnight ago.

Called “Adopting A Road”, the exercise is a call to improve traffic conditions in 65 areas known to consistently report more accidents than most others.

With Poonamallee figuring in the list, certain spots and roads in the locality are inviting measures to neautralise factors that contribute to accidents.

Installation of reflective signboards and reflectors, placing of steel barricades and creation of zebra crossings are among the notable measures to be taken in these spots and roads.

Besides, the focus would also be on checking encroachments and illegal parking.

There is already some noticeable intervention at Link Road (which connects Mount-Poonamallee Main Road with Poonamallee High Road), Mangadu intersection, Kattupakkam, Poonamallee Bypass and Kundrathur Main Road.

Each hotspot will be monitored by a traffic inspector within its limits.

“Apart from roads, key junctions, intersections and narrow bends that require safety intervention have been identified,” says N. Ramesh, Inspector, Poonamallee Traffic Enforcement.

The accident-prone spot and the nearby section, up to a distance of 500 metres, will be the focus of correctional measures.

The “Adopting A Road” initiative would require the traffic police to work closely with the other government agencies to ensure changes are effected.

For instance, to make sure these hotspots have concrete median, sufficient lighting, are rid of litter, and are not plagued by stray animals, the traffic police have to interact with the respective local bodies and government agencies.

“This initiative requires us to persuade other government departments including State Highways Department, the local bodies, Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (Tangedco) and the Revenue Department to effect certain changes. We have roped in residents and shopkeepers for the initiative,” says N. Ramesh, Inspector, Poonamallee Traffic Enforcement.

The local traffic police have to push for implementation of the necessary safety measures at the routine monthly inter-departmental meetings attended by all stakeholders, mostly government agencies.

The work by the local traffic police is being monitored by the City Police Commissionerate with a special traffic police team that will pay surprise visits to the hotspots to assess the impact of the initiative.

“Every day, we upload photos and videos of the measures being taken within our limits to the WhatsApp group of the city traffic police. Following these inputs, they will carry out a verification exercise independently,” says Ramesh.

On an average, each stretch and junction will be monitored for a month before the local traffic police adopt another stretch that is also in the list.

However, regular updates about the situation in stretches and spots covered earlier should be presented to the City Police Commissionerate.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bdq7kv/article32935682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25dcadyr-Poonamalle-Traffic-Police,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/poonamallee-roads-under-the-scanner/article32935685.ece
265,2020/10/24,Motorists do not have it easy at service lane in Porur,"Unauthorised parking impedes free movement of vehicular traffic

Pitted and often congested, the service lane on Mount – Poonamallee Main Road under the flyover at Porur junction, does not make for easy motoring. The vehicular traffic on this lane flows towards St. Thomas Mount.

It does not help matters that this service lane is located near the Porur junction, which often bustles with movement of vehicles, including Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses. With a few hospitals located in the vicinity, ambulances also frequent the junction. Further, an almost continuous stream of pedestrians would be crossing the intersection. Yet, the service lane is not well-maintained, residents point out.

The lane comes under the purview of the State Highways Department.

In comparison to the service lanes of other flyovers which were also opened a few years ago — such as the ones at Vadapalani, Vyasarpadi and Moolakadai — the service lane of the Porur flyover has not been maintained well.

“When it rains, it is difficult to use the lane because it gets inundated. The stretch has to be completely relaid,” says K. Venkatesh, a resident of Porur.

The residents have also raised the issue of unauthorised parking of vehicles on both sides of the service lane. It is three years since the flyover came up. However, residents say, the Porur intersection continues to be congested and pedestrians find it unsafe to cross it.

“Parking of vehicles should be strictly restricted,” adds Venkatesh.

In this respect, a State Highways official says, “Steps will be taken to have the lane relaid at the earliest.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/b3hct/article32935658.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25dctngr-Porur-Service-Lane-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/motorists-do-not-have-it-easy-at-service-lane-in-porur/article32935660.ece
266,2020/10/24,How a garbage storeroom morphed into an eatery,"Uncertainty in his corporate job leads S. Saravanan to start a food business in a space managed by the Association at his gated community

If you are on Chennai-Thiruvallur High Road, look out for Srivari Café outside Kochar Panchsheel Apartment in Ambattur Industrial Estate. Nothing fanciful about this café, but S. Saravanan promises to delight you with freshly-brewed coffee and his story of hope and resilience.

Saravanan was heading South India operations of a major brand until lockdown forced the organisation to close down certain divisions. With his 18 years of corporate experience, Saravanan got ready to start his own business.

“The idea of venturing into the food business was always there in my mind but I was not confident of taking the plunge; the lockdown was an opportunity for me to give it a shot,” says Saravanan.

His biggest advantage was finding a space to run the café from the comfort of his apartment, Kochar Panchsheel, where he is a resident for the last three years. A 100 sq. ft. space belonging to the apartment association was being used as space to keep waste before it was disposed of.

“It is outside the gated community but belongs to the Association so that came as an advantage as we could draw people from inside the community as well as outside,” says Saravanan.

The Association was happy to rent it out at a fee as the room was used to dump the garbage collected from every household. After solid waste management was introduced in the society, we were less dependent on this room.

“Getting the Association’s consent to use this space came as a timely help. Next, I got the space refurbished and spent close to ₹3.5 lakh replacing its tiles, undertaking patchwork on the walls and carrying out other works,” he says.

Running the outlet, however, was not a cake walk for this sales executive. Srivari Café opened in August by selling coffee and tea but it was running at a loss for close to a month. So, he added tiffin varieties to the menu but as Saravanan was outsourcing the production there were many challenges along the way.

“I hired a person who was without work as the school canteen he was working at was not operating. Things did not go as expected that I even thought if I should give up on this initiative,” he says.

The pricing of items seemed to contribute to the poor sales.

“I was selling a plate of two idli at ₹20 and that was a bit high for auto rickshaw drives and others looking for a quick bite, so I had to rework the rate chart,” he says, adding that he did not compromise on the quality of food.

After a short lull, Saravanan hired a new cook. “Serving breakfast as well as coffee/tea has started drawing customers, both from the society and outside,” he says. Many are repeat customers and that includes floating in and out of the locality and those employed at the companies on the stretch.

Saravanan is happy with the little progress he is making in the business. Ask him if he plans to return to the corporate world once the economy bounces back, Saravanan says, the satisfaction that he has got in the last couple of months is more than want he earned in the last 18 years.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5ubrbz/article32935655.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25dcangrcafe,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/how-a-garbage-storeroom-morphed-into-an-eatery/article32935656.ece
267,2020/10/24,A new assignment for the traffic police,"By ‘Adopting a Road’, they are expected to restore safety to accident-prone sections of Chennai

The Chennai City Traffic Police (CCTP) has launched a novel initiative — Adopt a Road — to ensure road safety and seamless regulation of traffic on accident-prone sections of the city, and the success of the exercise hinges on co-opting residents, motorists and government agencies such as Greater Chennai Corporation, Tangedco and State Highways Department into the initiative.

As part of this initiative, inaugurated by City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal a fortnight ago, 65 accident-prone spots have been identified within the Greater Chennai Police Commissionerate limits.

Each hotspot will be monitored by a Road Inspector (RI) of the traffic police. “The foremost job of the Road Inspector is to ensure free flow of traffic on the hotspot route and prevent accidents. Residents and local traders are also being roped in to help achieve this objective,” says M. Selvam, Inspector (traffic wing), Valasaravakkam police station.

Identification and selection of hotspots are carried out by the respective RIs within the police station limits. The selected hotspots have to be monitored by the RI after ensuring that all required safety measures are tucked into place.

For example, two high-definition flash lights were installed between La Chatelaine School and Kesavardhini bus stop in Valasaravakkam on Arcot Road by the RI of Valasaravakkam police station as the carriageway is narrow and without a median. Similarly, Purasawalkam Main Road, between Tana Street intersection and Doveton junction, is a hotspot route where the RI removed illegal parking and roadside eateries to ensure free flow of traffic especially during rush hour.

On an average, each hotspot route should cover a distance of at least 100 metres. Besides, every week, a hotspot route should be identified by the RI and it will be the shortlisted hotspot route for that week.

Along with previously selected hotspot routes, these new routes should be monitored continually. No time frame has been given for delisting hotspot routes from the routine monitoring exercise. Removal of obstructions, especially encroachments such as those put up by roadside vendors, eateries on footpath, street-light poles, electrical transformers also comes under the purview of the initiative. More importantly, the RI has to also ensure overgrown trees on the hotspot routes are pruned.

Actually, such pruning of trees within city limits should be carried out by the civic body. However, as an exception, traffic police personnel are now allowed to carry out this exercise to ensure road safety.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-new-assignment-for-the-traffic-police/article32935633.ece
268,2020/10/24,Uncleared debris comes in handy,"The Thirumangalam bridge overlooks their area. Old and broken tiles that were once part of the footpaths at the facility have saved the day for these residents

Construction debris lying uncleared after a work has always been an irritant for residents. There are exceptions though. And this exception to the rule involves residents of an area whose defining feature is that it is overlooked by the Thirumangalam bridge. They have found these leftover materials coming to their rescue.

Over 150 families, a majority of them wage labourers working at construction sites, live with hardly any basic facilities in this area, which is tucked between Koyambedu Metro Rail station and the bridge along the Cooum river.

Whenever the Cooum on this section registers a rise in water level, the area comes under sheets of water, which forces these residents to move to the Corporation-run night shelters and community centres.

This time around, a section of the people used the debris left behind to prevent inundation of their area.

It was a year ago since the State Highways Department undertook the work of installing new tiles on the damaged footpath on the small bridge. The replaced old and broken tiles were dumped on both sides of the bridge.

“We can’t afford to buy construction debris to level the narrow lanes in our area, and so we decided to make use of the dumped debris and carried out the levelling work,” explains S. Muniswamy, a resident.

With the city and its outskirts witnessing frequent rains in the recent weeks, residents of neighbourhood decided to increase the height of the streets by at least one foot above the bund of the river to prevent inundation. Dividing themselves into small teams of three each, a group of residents were on the bridge to take and pass the debris while the rest were below the bridge to level the streets. Residents also cleaned the existing open stormwater drains to allow excess rainwater to flow freely to the river. The entire exercise of levelling the streets with footpath debris took a few hours of work.

“Most of the men in the neighbourhood did not go for work on that day as they had to do the levelling work. In fact, they contributed their day’s earnings in terms of their labour for the common good,” notes a Corporation official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ar2mwm/article32935599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25DCANGRKOYAMBEDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/uncleared-debris-comes-in-handy/article32935600.ece
269,2020/10/24,Civic body to redress concerns on stormwater drain scheme,"Corporation decides to set up local panels to discuss project with residents

The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has decided to form local committees to redress the complaints of residents who are against the Integrated Storm Water Drainage (ISWD) scheme being executed in six divisions located along the East Coast Road (ECR).

The decision to have local committees, comprising assistant executive engineers and assistant engineers, was taken at a meeting organised by the civic body for members of residents welfare associations at Amma Maligai in the city on Thursday to clarify doubts and highlight the positive features of the ISWD project for preventing rainwater from flowing into the sea.

Residents and representatives from various associations and from the fishing community attended the two-hour-long meeting. They noted that officials had assured them of providing a detailed project report and holding further discussions on the project.

Chitra Rajan, resident of Akkarai, said, “Many residents pointed out that there were other civic amenities that needed to be given priority, such as better water supply and sewer network. The areas along the ECR do not need SWD as the sandy soil allows natural percolation of water. We have asked the civic body not to carry out the project without the consent of the residents.”

Residents also noted that the project would hinder groundwater recharge and was not necessary for localities along ECR, unlike other areas of the city. Ram Shankar, coordinator, Save Water and Recharge Aquifers Network, said several participants were not convinced about the project and insisted on dropping it. Even during the 2015 floods, areas along the ECR were not waterlogged. Recharge wells would help in better percolation.

A senior Corporation official said the local committees would take remedial measures for any complaints by the residents. Thousands of cubic metres of rainwater would be saved by creating percolating wells in sandy areas, which would prevent it from going to waste into the sea. He said more than 20 eco-block wells, 168 sunken wells and 2,000 percolation pits were proposed for the divisions covering Kottivakkam, Palavakkam, Neelankarai, Injambakkam, Sholinganallur and Uthandi.

The Kovalam basin project is being funded by KfW, the German development bank, and the detailed project report is being prepared by Kocks Consultants, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/opltkq/article32934889.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25LEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/civic-body-to-redress-concerns-on-stormwater-drain-scheme/article32934890.ece

271,2020/10/24,Multi-level car park project at pedestrian plaza delayed,"Work may end by December; opening date to be decided soon

The Pondy Bazaar pedestrian plaza will celebrate its first anniversary in a few weeks. However, the promised multi-level car park is yet to become functional, though the civil work is nearly complete.

The equipment for the facility arrived from China earlier this year but COVID-19 and the resultant lockdown, both in Wuhan and later in India, disrupted the deadlines. Work on the car park started in July. The swanky facility, with its glass facade, is all set to become a landmark.

Officials said the equipment had been installed and were being tested. However, the technical team from Wuhan is yet to arrive to give its final approval. The launch date will be decided by the month-end, an official said. According to him, the work will be completed by the end of December. The parking lot can accommodate 222 cars and around 350 two-wheelers.

Roads get a makeover

Meanwhile, roads adjoining the plaza are getting a makeover. An official said civil work on G.N. Chetty Road and Venkatanarayana Road had been completed. Roads have been laid as well.

However, with the festival season setting in, residential localities around the Pondy Bazaar pedestrian plaza have been under tremendous pressure, bearing the brunt of the increased vehicular traffic.

Adjacent roads such as Gopalakrishna Street, Masilamani Street, Muthukrishnan Street and Raja Street are notorious for vehicles pushing pedestrians to the edge.

Prakash Galada, a long-time resident of T. Nagar, suggested that the battery-operated cars display a sticker indicating that they do not charge for transport. “It has not been made clear that it is a free service. I see people waiting to tip the drivers,” he said.

Though officials say the plaza work is almost complete, residents are not sure if the streets would ever be peaceful. Tangedco has dug deep trenches to lay underground cables in Thanikachalam Road and Arcot Street.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/d1uy4s/article32934881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THCARPARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/multi-level-car-park-project-at-pedestrian-plaza-delayed/article32934882.ece

274,2020/10/24,Teen swindles ₹9.5 lakh from a elderly man’s bank account,"He used the money to play online games

The Cyber Crime Cell of Anna Nagar solved an online fraud involving a 17-year-old following a complaint lodged by a 75-year-old doctor that ₹7.5 lakh was debited from his bank account without his authorisation.

The 75-year-old retired government doctor was staying alone at Anna Nagar while his two sons lived abroad and a daughter, who is also a doctor, lives in Kancheepuram. A domestic aide and her son staying with the doctor had been taking care of him for five years.

While the doctor was staying with his daughter in Kancheepuram, he realised that ₹7.5 lakh from his account had been debited between March and August. He lodged a complaint with the Anna Nagar police, who forwarded the complaint to Cyber Crime Cell. The doctor had an ordinary mobile phone. His family did not allow the police to interrogate the domestic aide and her son since they trusted them.

During investigation, the police found that the money was transferred from the bank account to two mobile wallets and an e-commerce portal and also was used to buy popular online games.

The police team managed to trace a mobile phone number linked to an electronic wallet, which was used by the boy who lived in the doctor’s house. The teenager had allegedly collected details of the bank account and debit card while helping the doctor do online transactions in March. The doctor was unaware of the transactions although he received alerts on his mobile phone. The boy spent ₹9.5 lakh from the doctor’s account for buying games and gadgets.

276,2020/10/24,Government-run retail outlets in Chennai sell onions at ₹45 a kg,"Only 1 kg allowed per consumer; 10 tonnes sold by Farm Fresh in two days

The government-run Farm Fresh outlets in the city sold nearly 10 tonnes of onions at subsidised prices in two days. The Department of Cooperation is sourcing more onions to keep the price line under control.

On Friday, there were long queues since early morning in front of Farm Fresh outlets, which sold onions for ₹45 a kg. Initially, 2 kg of onions were sold to each consumer. Soon, the quantity was restricted to 1 kg as demand soared.

Stocks from Maharashtra

Officials said about 32 tonnes of onions had arrived in the city for sale. About 300 tonnes would be procured from Maharashtra through the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation by Monday.

The stock would be sent to 65 outlets across the State.

The department is in the process of sourcing small onions from the Horticulture Department as it was also very expensive. The demand for small onions is high in other parts of the State as compared to Chennai, officials said.

In the retail market, onions sold at ₹90 a kg and small onions at ₹140 a kg on Friday.

Koyambedu wholesalers said the market received 80-100 tonnes of Egyptian onions on Thursday and sold them for ₹60 a kg. This contributes to 20% of the arrivals. Most of the stock of onions were sold out as Friday was a holiday.

Traders’ plea

Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu Federation of All Farmers’ Association and Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peramaippu have urged the government to reopen all semi-wholesale and retail shops in Koyambedu ahead of the festive season.

At a meeting on Friday, federation president P.R. Pandian said the closure not only affected traders but also farmers as the market received produce from 22 districts across Tamil Nadu.

The federation plans to hold conferences on the Centre’s farm laws in five zones of the State along with the traders’ body.

278,2020/10/24,"India’s UN journey, from outlier to the high table","As a non-permanent UNSC member now, it needs to uphold the Charter principles in the backdrop of a turbulent world

The 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations (UN) is an opportunity to look at the major trends, patterns and future challenges as far as India is concerned in terms of safeguarding its interests and promoting common good. That the UN is indispensable is uncontested despite the clamour for reforms to strengthen its role. As Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru once observed in his address to the UN General Assembly on December 20, 1956, “Of course, even if the United Nations did not do anything wonderful, the mere fact of the United Nations itself has been of great significance to the world....”

Membership and phases

Seven and a half decades of India at the UN may be viewed with reference to roughly three distinct phases. In the first phase until the end of the Cold War in 1989, India had learnt the ropes of exploring and enhancing its diplomatic influence as a moderating force in easing armed conflicts in Asia and Africa by disentangling them from the superpower rivalry. In parallel, the Indian leadership learned the hard way that the UN could not be relied upon to impartially resolve vital security disputes such as Jammu and Kashmir.

Editorial | At the high table: On India’s U.N. Security Council win

As such, it strove to utilise the UN only to focus on common causes such as anti-colonialism, anti-racism, nuclear disarmament, environment conservation and equitable economic development. India, in a clever way, seemed to claim the moral high ground by proposing, in 1988, a bold, but obviously impractical, three-phase plan to eliminate nuclear weapons from the surface of earth. But it resisted attempts by neighbouring countries to raise bilateral problems. This was reflected during the Bangladesh liberation war and after. In essence, a loss of face for India in the 1962 border war against China meant a definitive redesign of the country’s diplomatic style to privilege bilateral contacts over the third party role by the UN.

A demanding decade

The 1990s spelled the most difficult decade for India in the world body, as the years were marked by the sudden end of the Cold War, the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the resultant emergence of the United States as the unrivalled power in world politics. Besides, the uncertain political climate caused by unstable coalition governments along with the balance of payments crisis constrained the country’s capability to be active in various bodies, especially in the Security Council (UNSC) and the General Assembly.

There was a change in India’s foreign policy which was reflected in voting patterns at the UN. To cite a few examples, India showed pragmatism in enabling the toughest terms on Iraq even after eviction from occupied Kuwait, or in reversing the hitherto stated position on Zionism as racism. At the same time, growing militancy in Kashmir in the early 1990s emboldened Pakistan to internationalise the dispute with accusations about gross human rights violations by India. Clearly, India had to work hard to seek favours from Iran and China in the Human Rights Commission to checkmate Pakistan.

Analysis | U.N. draft declaration for 75th anniversary goes soft on India’s demand for reform

The threat posed to respect for sovereignty principle by NATO intervention against Yugoslavia in 1999 without the authorisation of the UNSC deeply disturbed India, but its efforts, in partnership with Russia and China, to call for an end to aerial attacks did not garner much support in the UNSC. Further, the extent of India’s diplomatic difficulties was exposed when it suffered a humiliating defeat in the hands of Japan in the 1996 contest for a non-permanent seat in the UNSC.

This, however, did not mean that India could not draw red lines on questions of serious consequences to its security. India resolutely stood against indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995, and it stoutly rejected the backdoor introduction for adoption of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996. It is notable that these two developments at the UN perhaps pushed India to surprise the world in 1998 with its Pokhran nuclear weapon tests, ignoring the likely adverse reaction from the nuclear club.

Editorial | A new world order: On UN reforms

Winds of change

Remarkably, the 21st century opened new avenues for India to shine at the UN. The impressive economic performance in the first decade, thanks to economic liberalisation and globalisation policies, helped a great deal in strengthening its profile. This is only aided by its reliable and substantial troop contributions to several peacekeeping operations in African conflict theatres. Alongside, India has emerged as a responsible stakeholder in non-traditional security issue areas such as the spread of small and light weapons, the threat of non-state actors acquiring weapons of mass destruction, and the impact of climate change. In a related dimension, India has scaled up its contributions to development and humanitarian agencies, while India’s share to the UN assessed budget has registered a hike from 0.34% to 0.83%.

Finally, India’s growing popularity is evident in the successful electoral contests for various prestigious slots in the UNSC, the Human Rights Council, the World Court, and functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council, at times defeating the nominees of China and the United Kingdom. However, two major initiatives India has heavily invested in are stuck without much hope of a timely outcome. The first relates to the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism it drafted and revised with the hope of helping consensus. But it encountered reservations from among Islamic and other countries on provisions regarding definition of terrorist and the convention’s application to state armed forces.

Security Council expansion

Equally important is the question of equitable expansion of the UNSC to enable India to attain permanent membership along with other claimants from Asia, Africa and Latin America. The move has been stuck for more than 25 years because of a lack of unity among the regional formations. It also includes stout opposition from some 30 middle powers such as Italy and Pakistan which fear losing out to regional rivals in the event of an addition of permanent seats, and the intrigues masterminded by one or two permanent members. Although India enjoys by far the greatest support,the only realistic possibility seems to settle for a compromise, i.e. a new category of members elected for a longer duration than the present non-permanent members without veto power.

Also read | Accorded ‘highest priority’ to getting permanent membership of UNSC: India

India’s future role will probably depend on its ability to weather the impact of the multiple crises it now faces on account of an unabated economic slowdown and a troubled relationship with China. This is pertinent as India will soon begin its two-year term as a non-permanent UNSC member (January 1, 2021). Its areas of priority will continue to be the upholding of Charter principles, mounting effective punitive measures against those who support, finance and sponsor terrorists, besides striving for securing due say to the troop contributing countries in the management of peace operations. It is reasonable to assume (based on earlier patterns) that India will work for and join in consensus on key questions wherever possible. But it may opt to abstain along with other members including one or two permanent members.

Once in the seat

In the midst of the currently volatile situation as characterised by the Trump administration’s disdain towards multilateral institutions, the changing U.S.-China equation, China’s growing political isolation on account of the spread of the novel coronavirus, and China’s aggressive territorial forays in eastern Ladakh and the South China Sea, India may face challenges and opportunities in the UNSC. In an unlikely scenario of China succeeding in convening a formal meeting on Kashmir to please Pakistan, India may have to choose either to abstain in the vote since it is a party to the dispute or vote against any unfavourable proposal that might be tabled. Exercising the latter option would be the first of its kind in India’s voting record at the UNSC. On the other hand, the growing proximity with the U.S. may prompt India not to stay neutral in order to counter balance China.

279,2020/10/24,"Letters to the Editor — October 24, 2020","Politics over vaccine

The promise of free distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine for Bihar in exchange of votes for the BJP is not only politically immoral and unethical but also constitutionally flawed as well.

It is absolutely immoral and unethical because such a conditional offer of a life-saving vaccine still in different stages of trials amounts to a trade-off on critical issues of public health care. It is constitutionally flawed because such an offer cannot be made to one particular State going through an election process to the exclusion of others. This is unabashed exploitation of people’s genuine paranoia in a State well known for the appalling state of its public health-care infrastructure. The party’s vision document also promises a job bonanza even as lakhs of people from this State with chronic unemployment have been migrating in desperation to the rest of India in search of a livelihood. In this context, voters in the State would do well to remember the Prime Minister’s unfulfilled promise of creating two crore new jobs annually in his election speeches in 2014. It is for the people in Bihar to take a final call.

Manual scavenging

The spate of letters reflecting shock and surprise on seeing a scavenger in a manhole provokes me to ask these questions. Were municipal authorities aware of the flagrant violation of the rules laid down that manual scavenging should not be permitted under any circumstances? Was any supervisor nearby to oversee this operation? It is a stark fact that none in charge of clearing manholes pays attention to the provisions of the regulations laid down.

280,2020/10/24,‘Colour Photo’ review: A moving tale that’s more than skin deep,"Director Sandeep Raj goes against the norms of masala-laden Telugu cinema, helped by a terrific performance by Suhas

‘It’s 1999 and people still discriminate based on skin colour and caste,’ rues Jayakrishna (Suhas) in Colour Photo, now streaming on Aha. Oh well, in 2020 we still need the hashtag ‘Black Lives Matter’ and skin lightening creams continue to have many takers.

Colour Photo, with its story by Sai Rajesh and screenplay, direction by debutant Sandeep Raj is a film about a dark-skinned underdog, made by a group of underdogs who have worked their way into the Telugu film industry after winning over viewers with their short films. The leads Suhas and Chandini Chowdary, the supporting cast that includes Viva Harsha and Srividya Palaparthi, and Sandeep himself are familiar names to those who’ve been attuned to Telugu content on YouTube.

Colour Photo Cast: Suhas, Chandini Chowdary, Sunil

Direction: Sandeep Raj

Music: Kala Bhairava

Streaming on: Aha

Almost similar to their journey in shorts, where they began with comedies and moved to other genres, Colour Photo has its share of laughs when it takes us into Machilipatnam of the late 1990s, and then reveals its true, deeper colours.

Jayakrishna is the son of a milk man, and a mechanical engineering student. He is sincere, works hard, can be described as average in academics, is an introvert, and wants to lead a life of dignity. He knows that education is his passport to better means of livelihood and recognition in society. He falls in love with the comparatively well off and fair-skinned Deepti (Chandini), whose cop brother Ramaraju (Sunil) is a vily moral police officer.

It’s a familiar terrain, but the narrative makes all the difference. When Jayakrishna first sees Deepti, she is dressed as a goddess and rehearsing for a dance performance. His admiration for her is reverential, more than youthful attraction. He is aware that he’s no match to her. She makes the first move and the romance blooms slowly; Jayakrishna stays guarded knowing that the journey wouldn’t be easy.

Sandeep establishes the characters and their bonds beautifully — be it the segment in San Francisco between a couple and the happenings at a funeral soon after (this deserves a discussion, but let’s keep it spoiler free for now), or the friends in the engineering college. The writing gives enough room for the supporting characters to flourish. Divya Sripada and Viva Harsha as the friends, and Srividya as Deepti’s sister in law have definitive character arcs and come up with good performances.

Apart from skin colour and class, the film talks about gender viewpoints. Take for instance when one woman tells another that the heartbreaks of women never get told on screen because it’s the men who are making movies. Men can seek refuge in alcohol like Devdas, but women are married off even before they can mend their broken hearts.

The casual racism that arises in the garb of humour is also addressed. Black and white photo, gulab jamun and rasgulla are among the many terms to take a jibe at couples of different skin colours. And more than once there’s an image of lord Krishna in the backdrop, to highlight the ironical plight of those like Jayakrishna in a country that worships dark-skinned Gods.

There are interesting segments like the fight between team British and Vanarasena in college, and the speech that Jayakrishna gives in the presence of a light-skinned foreigner. There’s also the dichotomy of Ramaraju who is also dark skinned but loathes Jayakrishna.

As the film takes on a melodramatic hue, a few scenes reminded me of Pariyerum Perumal and Asuran (Tamil) and maybe it’s Sandeep way of doffing his hat to these filmmakers as much as he celebrates the masala-laden 90s ruled by Chiranjeevi, Nagarjuna and Venkatesh. I was also reminded of 96 (Jaanu in Telugu) when one character hypothetically changes the narrative. If only things had happened that way!

Colour Photo is hard-hitting and emotionally moving, but it could have been shorter. I also wish it hadn’t spelled out too much and left the audience to interpret things for themselves.

However, these are just niggles. Colour Photo has a lot going for it, including the reason for the title. Even the small portion where Jayakrishna’s father shares his own story adds depth to the characters and their fight for dignity.

Leading from the front is Suhas, with a performance that comes from the heart. He is a powerhouse of talent, just like actor Priyadarshi, with an ability to move like a chameleon between comic roles and emotionally moving characters. Chandini does well as the woman of privilege who is also sensitive and empathetic. A restrained and effective performance also comes in from Aadarsh Balakrishna. Sunil is all menace and boy, he makes you hate that venom.

The production design and cinematography deserve a mention, and most importantly music composer Kala Bhairava for an evocative background score that has an endearing old world charm.

Colour Photo requires a patient viewing, given its deliberate slow pace. But it has plenty to root for. The team deserves a pat on the pack for going against the norms in Telugu cinema. After Mallesham and Uma Maheswara Ugra Roopasya, this is another film that celebrates the average, common man as a hero. That’s a good thing.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/3c83uk/article32935419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Colour-Photo-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/colour-photo-is-a-moving-story-on-skin-deep-issues-and-more/article32935420.ece
281,2020/10/24,Veggie burgers are still burgers: EU,"Plant-based products that do not contain meat can be sold, EU lawmakers rule

It’s a meaty issue but the EU has taken a stance — veggie burgers are in fact burgers.

Watch | Decoding alternative meat: Will plant-based protein find takers in India?

European lawmakers said Friday that plant-based products that do not contain meat, including veggie burgers, soy steaks and vegan sausages, can continue to be sold as such in restaurants and shops across the European Union’s 27 countries.

Europe’s largest farmers’ association, Copa-Cogeca, had supported a ban, arguing that labelling vegetarian substitutes with designations bringing meat to mind was misleading for consumers.

On the opposite side of the debate, a group of 13 organisations including Greenpeace and WWF urged lawmakers to reject the proposed amendments, arguing that a ban would have not only exposed the EU “to ridicule,” but also damaged its environmental credibility.

They said promoting a shift toward more plant-based diet is in line with the EU Commission’s ambition to tackle global warming. Losing the ability to use the terms steak or sausage might make those plant-based products more obscure for consumers.

Also read: Ctrl+alt+delete meat: Where do you stand on plant-based protein?

After the vote, the European Consumer Organisation, an umbrella group bringing together consumers’ associations, praised the MEPs for their “common sense.”

""Consumers are in no way confused by a soy steak or chickpea-based sausage, so long as it is clearly labelled as vegetarian or vegan,” the group said in a statement. “Terms such as ‘burger’ or ‘steak’ on plant-based items simply make it much easier for consumers to know how to integrate these products within a meal.”

Together with Greenpeace, the group regretted that lawmakers accepted further restrictions on the naming of alternative products containing no dairy. Terms like ‘almond milk’ and ‘soy yogurt’ are already banned in Europe after the bloc’s top court ruled in 2017 that purely plant-based products can’t be marketed using terms such as milk, butter or cheese, which are reserved for animal products.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/lcd7nx/article32935833.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDBURGERS,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/veggie-burgers-are-still-burgers-at-least-in-europe/article32935834.ece
282,2020/10/24,When your neighbours become foodpreneurs,"What does it mean to start a cloud kitchen at the gated community you live in and feed your neighbours? A resident of Mantri Synergy in Padur has an answer

One floor down; one floor up; and a door away — that was all the stretching they needed to do to find the resources, the homespun wisdom and encouragement required to start a cloud kitchen.

To make it less cryptic, in August, amidst the pandemic, Anuradha Nair and her husband Rahul Keshu, teamed up with Deepa Mukherjee (who is Anuradha’s sister) and her husband Saurav Mukherjee and started Tumbo Cafe, a multi-cuisine cloud kitchen, at the gated community they live in. At Mantri Synergy in Padur, these two families reside at the same block, and are only a floor apart.

Freya Wilson, a graphic designer by profession who teaches the subject at a college, lives on the same floor as Anuradha, and she was roped in to carry out the design and artwork for Tumbo.

“The space where Tumbo is located has so far been let out only for residents, for a nominal rent, to run a cafe for the benefit of the community,” discloses Anuradha.

Around the time this space fell vacant, the four could see the debilitating effects of kitchen fatigue all around them. They even had a front-row view of it, having watched members of their own family battling it.

Anuradha says she noticed that many of her neighbours were fed up to their finger tips putting on the apron and cooking three meals a day, and they desperately wanted a break, and order at least one meal.

“During the intense lockdown, many senior citizens were cooking for themselves, and they found it a dreary business,” says Anuradha. “My father- and mother-in-law, both in their eighties, live alone, on the same floor as my sister Deepa. My mother-in-law would insist that her family would eat only the food made at home, cooked by her, but she was struggling through the cooking. Now, she has started ordering food once in a while.”

Anuradha believes there is a distinct advantage to both serving people in your own community, and being served by them.

From the foodpreneurs’ point of view, they know many of their customers at a personal level, and which could mean they are in a position to customise the takeouts, without being reminded how to.

“There is someone we know who has a kidney ailment, and we know what food he is looking for. So, the same meals will come with less salt and oil for him,” says Anuradha.

From the customers’ point of view, it is always reassuring to know that there is nothing set even about a set menu.

“We have introduced set menus, but there is nothing cut and dried about it, and we would rework the combo anytime. So, if someone wants just one roti instead of the three that a pre-set menu may specify, we would be naturally inclined to relax the rule. Often, to the greatest extent possible. We cannot lose sight of the fact that we are on a transaction with neighbours.”

When you are running a food business in your community, especially among neighbours you know very well, expect impromptu addas.

Though Tumbo is a cloud kitchen, it sometimes becomes a space for an “adda”, notes Anuradha.

“We offer a full pot of chai in the morning and evening. When we do so, sometimes, before we know it, an adda-like thing would be going on under our nose.”

The four also know that in its core, this is an enterprise that has to succeed to justify its existence.

So, the line of control are the workflow are clearly defined. Deepa and Saurav are engaged in the day-to-day functioning of the cloud kitchen. Rahul takes care of the part involving the procurement of essential items required daily in the kitchen. Anuradha handles the communications and social media aspects of the enterprise, and is assisted in this work by Freya.

The challenge in continuing with household help caused by the pandemic has naturally increased the demand for takeouts.

Anuradha says, “There is always going to be a section of the community that would look for outside food.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/chfgh6/article32935563.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25dctumbo,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/when-your-neighbours-become-foodpreneurs/article32935564.ece

The Shiv Sena has decided to organise its annual Dasara rally on Sunday at an auditorium in Mumbai and not on the Shivaji Park ground, where the event is traditionally held.

This decision was taken in view of the COVID-19 safety protocols, in which the Sena-led Maharashtra government has prohibited political, social and religious gatherings, party sources said on Saturday. This is the first time the rally is being held outside Shivaji Park, where party workers gather in large numbers to hear the Sena chief address them on Dasara evening.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who is president of the Sena, will address the party workers from the Swatantryaveer Savarkar auditorium opposite the Shivaji Park ground at Dadar in central Mumbai at 7 p.m., the sources said. He and his family members will first pay their respects at the memorial of late party founder Bal Thackeray at Shivaji Park.

Party sources said that only a group of 50 people, including Ministers and leaders, will have access to the auditorium. The event will be telecast live on all the social media accounts of the party.

286,2020/10/24,Notes from Baijnath,"And to this day, in honour of Ravana’s dedication, neither is Ravana’s effigy burnt by the residents, nor do they buy sweets or light fireworks

For a handful of places across India, the celebration of good versus evil that today’s Dussehra festival espouses is not as definitively black or white as most would like it to be. But then, nor is the mythology that birthed it and thousands of other festivals — both religious and otherwise — not just in India, but around the world as well.

There are a myriad interpretations. Just ask the inhabitants of the sleepy little town of Baijnath in Himachal Pradesh. This year’s Dussehra might be muted across the country due to the pandemic, but in Baijnath, Dussehra has always been an annual no-show.

Unsung hero or wrathful foe?

Perched at an altitude of 4,311 feet on the Himalayan Dhauladhar mountain range, Baijnath is one of those rare places in India where Dussehra has never been celebrated, nor has the ensuing drama of the Ram Leela ever played out. All of this, thanks to an unlikeliest protagonist at the very vortex of it all — Ravana.

Legend has it that the ‘demon king of Lanka’ was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva and prayed to him deep in the Himalayas seeking immortality. In return for which, Ravana chopped off his own ten heads at the altar.

So impressed was Shiva with this act of devotion that he is said to have restored the heads — only this time, six of the heads for the six most significant Puranas and four for the four Vedas. The 12th century Baijnath rock temple constructed in the Nagara style of architecture and the surrounding town of the same name were built upon this myth.

And to this day, in honour of Ravana’s dedication, neither is Ravana’s effigy burnt by the residents, nor do they buy sweets or light fireworks. Interestingly, the town is also totally devoid of jewellery shops. This is apparently to mourn Hanuman’s torching of Ravana’s Lanka which was said to be made of gold.

However, according to some, it is not entirely respect for Ravana but also an all-consuming emotion of fear that prevents any Dussehra celebrations from taking place in Baijnath. As in most small towns across India, myths of destructive wrath and punishment abound here too.

Everything from decades of bad luck to more ominous omens in the form of unnatural deaths to those who take part in any Dussehra festivities keep the Baijnath townsfolk away from celebrating on Dussehra night.

Dussehra dodgers

Baijnath, however, is not alone in its shunning of Dussehra. There are other Ravana-sympatico places in India where the shine of Dussehra is a tad diminished, if not fully taken off.

While the people of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh refer to Ravana as their ‘son-in-law’, as they believe that their town is the paternal home of his wife, Mandodari, Bisrakh in Uttar Pradesh claims him as its own.

According to local belief, Ravana, the son of a sage named Vishrava and Kaikeshi, a Daitya princess, was born in Bisrakh.

As it is believed that Mandore in Rajasthan is where Ravana married Mandodari, on the day of Dussehra, priests of the local Ravan Ki Chanwari temple here perform the shraadh ceremony for his soul.

In Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district, the village of Paraswadi is nothing but a glorified hamlet, home to a handful of people from the Gond tribe. They call themselves Ravanwashis or descendants of Ravana, resolutely refusing to be identified as Hindus.

But perhaps there is no better place than one actually named after Ravana to seek an answer to the million dollar “was he good or evil?” question.

Ravangram in Madhya Pradesh is a village that has a legion of devotees who actually worship a 10-feet-long reclining statue of Ravana in an ancient temple constructed by a sect called the Kanyakubja Brahmins that Ravana was said to be a member of. Putting it all into perspective, one cannot help but ponder over a rather controversial quote often attributed to Winston Churchill. Is history truly written by the victors?

288,2020/10/24,Private buses get low patronage,"Very few have resumed services

Although private buses have resumed skeletal services in the city under a set of precautionary norms stipulated by the government and with strict limits on permissible seating and standing capacity, it could take at least a few weeks for the operations to stabilise, the operators said.

Of the approximately 220 buses operating, only a fraction of the vehicles are back on the road after nearly seven months. Bus owners said that because of the long break, many buses would have to be serviced to make them roadworthy.

Inter-State services are yet to resume in the Villupuram, Cuddalore, Tindivanam and Chidambaram sectors. The resumption of services on routes follows a meeting convened with operators by Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy recently.

According to the operators, the concession offered was a waiver of road tax for two quarters of the fiscal — the per quarter rates were about ₹28,000 for inter-State, ₹18,000 for intra-State and ₹14,000 for town service categories.

“It could take some time for people to patronise bus services. Most buses are running well below permitted capacity during off-peak hours,” said Bharathi Kannan, president of the Puducherry Private Bus Owners’ Association.

Following the norms

Adopting social distancing norms means that only one passenger would sit on the two-seat block and two on the three-seat block while 25 passengers were allowed to travel standing.

More than the restrictions on passengers though, poor patronage was adding to the operational cost. “We hope the situation will improve once inter-State services begin,” Mr. Kannan said.

The association appealed to the government for an increase in ticket prices to cover the losses as they were operating with reduced passenger capacity. While the Transport Commissioner had written to his counterpart in Tamil Nadu, the Chief Minister had assured them of taking up the matter of resumption of inter-State services with Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, the association said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ulrh4/article32933454.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THPONDYBUSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/private-buses-get-low-patronage/article32933455.ece

Following a review, Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi said health authorities were going to start a post-COVID-19 follow-up centre, with the participation of private hospitals. Post-sunset testing too will be introduced and test timings adjusted at certain places, such as areas near schools, during opening and closing hours, to prevent congestion.

291,2020/10/24,Local body polls will bring about shift in governance: Bedi,"L-G optimistic about bigger role for women in the decision-making process

The conduct of local body elections will cause a “dramatic” shift in governance of the Union Territory as it will ensure the participation of women in decision-making, Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi said on Friday.

“The elected men and women will be able to plan and ensure due implementation of their own programmes. Women will form one-third of this grassroots leadership, which is a dramatic shift in governance of the U.T. Right now, there is no woman in the Cabinet,” Ms. Bedi said in a message to reporters.

After the elections, many women would be involved in planning and decision-making, she said and urged the Local Administration Department and the District Rural Development Agency to educate people on the likely changes.

The Education Department could be involved in the awareness programme as the services of teachers could be used, she said. “There is no going back now. We have a legal direction (Supreme Court order on conducting polls) to process the elections without any delay,” she said.

The team led by the Chief Secretary had ensured that an experienced person was appointed as the State Election Commissioner. The office of the Lt. Governor had fulfilled its responsibility so as to ensure everything went legally, Ms. Bedi said. “We now have to grasp this change quickly and get ready in identifying and choosing right candidates in the coming months so that we can ensure a prosperous Puducherry.”

Process set in motion

Refusing to get drawn into the controversy surrounding his appointment, State Election Commissioner Roy P. Thomas on Friday said he had initiated the process to hold local body elections in Puducherry.

“I will not comment on the appointment issue. It needs deliberation and there are several facts surrounding the issue. But I have started the process to conduct the elections. I cannot predict whether it will be held before or after the Assembly elections. All I can assure is that civic body polls will be held at an appropriate time,” he said at his first press conference after assuming charge. All the stakeholders would be consulted in due course on holding the elections.

Mr. Thomas said he had called on Ms. Bedi and Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy after assuming charge on Wednesday as per protocol.

Key appointments to conducting the polls, including that of district and regional election officers, would be made shortly. The next task would be to prepare the draft electoral roll. The delimitation process had been completed, the SEC added.

Stating that it was “unfortunate” that civic body elections were not held for a long time, he said local bodies were the backbone of the administration.

Whether in terms of delivery of services or people’s participation in governance local bodies played an important role in a democracy, he added.

The local bodies also played a major role in making women part of the governance process. Also, economically and socially weaker sections get representation in governance, the SEC said

301,2020/10/24,GITAM campus partially demolished by Revenue department,"Authorities say about 40 acres of government land occupied by the institution

In an early morning swoop, the Revenue Department demolished part of the campus belonging to GITAM deemed to be university, here on Saturday.

According to Revenue officials, about 40 acres of government land had been occupied by the educational institution and the management was informed about it.

Speaking to the media at the demolished site, RDO Kishore Kumar said about 40 acres belonging to the government had been under occupation by the private university since many years and this was informed to them.

According to him, the land was occupied both by GITAM Institute of Medical Sciences and Research and GITAM deemed to be University. He pointed out that at about 18 acres had been occupied under various survey numbers of Yendada and 20 acres under Rushikonda.

“We have today demolished the compound wall on the Rushikonda side and also on the Yendada side and reclaimed the occupied land that is vacant inside the campus, which includes roads, gardens, playgrounds and other vacant sites. We have also done the markings,” Mr. Kumar said.

According to him, permanent structures had also been surveyed and the marking had been done and it had been informed to the management. “Once we reclaim the vacant occupied land, we will then deal with the permanent structures in the next phase,” he said.

The RDO informed that the private university had earlier sought for alienation of 71 acres of land at market value, but it was not accepted by the government.

On whether notices were served, he did not give a clear answer, but said that the management was informed in advance.

‘No notices served’

The spokesperson of the private university claimed no notices were served and the demolition of an educational institute in such a manner was unlawful.

A huge contingent of police force accompanied the demolition squad and cordoned off both the roads leading to the university on the Yendada and Rushikonda side, in the early hours around 3 a.m. Without any notice, the demolition began at around 4 a.m., said the spokesperson.

Speaking to The Hindu, GITAM president, M. Sribharat said the demolition was gross violation of basic rules, as it was done in the early hours and on a holiday.

GITAM was started by former TDP MP MVVS Murthi in 1980 and was the first private engineering college in this part of the State. It later turned autonomous and became a deemed university in 2007.

306,2020/10/24,Onion price brings tears to people,"Special counters opened at rythu bazaars to provide onions at subsidised rate

Yet again the price of onions hit the roof bringing tears to consumers in city. Consumers thronged special counters at rythu bazaars to buy the ‘bulb’ being sold on subsidy.

The onion price, which was barely ₹30 a kg in the open market not long ago, has now hit a century.

The yawning gap in the demand and supply is said to be the reason for the steep rise. The solace for consumers, to some extent, is the opening of special counters at rythu bazaars in the city to provide 1 kg of onions to each customer at a subsidised price of ₹40 from Friday. The price at the regular counters at rythu bazaars, which was ₹77 a kg a few days ago, was also reduced to ₹74 a kg.

Short supply

“The wholesale market at Gnanapuram in the city is getting only around 100 tonnes of onions a day as against the demand of 250 to 300 tonnes a day,” says A. Kurma Rao, vice president of the Wholesale Vegetable Dealers Association. The loss of onion crop in Maharashtra, which is considered the principal supplier of onions to the country, due to rains is said to be the cause. Smaller size onions are also produced in Kurnool district in Andhra Pradesh. But, the production is very limited and does not meet the requirement.

307,2020/10/24,Palanpur tribune: Review of ‘Rumble in a Village’ by Luc Leruth and Jean Drèze,"The authors’ credentials shine through in their informed depiction of the caste-ridden badlands of India

Moved at the sight of this bare hovel, the children in rags, and their hospitality, I handed a fifty rupee note to the young man, adding ‘Use the money wisely. Maybe you should invest it in fixing the house.’”To this, Smita, a Dalit schoolteacher, responds brusquely: “‘Who are you to tell these people what they should do? Even with the little money you give them?… Our children have names like Bhukhan and Dukhi. If he invests fifty rupees on fixing the roof, will it make him feel better? No! He will still be miserable on a daily basis.’” This is an exchange from Rumble in a Village, a novelby Luc Leruth and Jean Drèze — economists both, but writing fiction this time.

Layered tapestries

Anil’s charitable attempt at telling the Dalit family what to do is justifiably met with Smita’s indignation. The dialogue points at how, among other things, centuries of subjugation manifest themselves even in the names of Dalits. And this holds true for 21st century India as well. The narrator of Rumble in a Village is an upper-caste male who accepts the injustice that his clans have inflicted on farmers and labourers over decades. Despite being on a slippery surface the narrative voice never assumes a patronising tone. In turn, Dalit voices, angry and anguished, are asserted repeatedly.

The novel starts with fear looming large over the village of Palanpur in Uttar Pradesh in 1984: gunshots are heard, Anil’s uncle is

murdered. After hearing the news of his uncle’s death, Anil, living in London, decides to go back to his ancestral village to unearth the truth. He befriends a frail Babu Ram, a Dalit, and learns that Babu’s mother has been arrested in connection with the murder. As Anil sets out to find the real culprit, we are taken on a journey through the layered tapestries of power, privilege and caste dynamics in rural UP.

Palanpur has three main caste groups: Dalits (mostly Chamars), the agriculturist Muraos, and the landholding Thakurs. Anil’s theoretical readings on farming get unwittingly rubbished by Kishan Lal, a hardworking Murao farmer. Kishan becomes Anil’s version of Zorba the Greek. For company, Anil keeps returning to his partner Pat, some audio cassettes, a camera, a billy goat and his father’s diary. John le Carré is distinctly missing.

The diary takes us on a historical excursion from 1869, documenting the lives, feuds and prejudices of Palanpur. Anil learns of his ancestors’ contribution in controlling land and the landless through the diary.

While Palanpur is very real, it also at times assumes mythical proportions, like Marquez’s Macondo. There are markers of change over time: the rumours of a metallic monster that can go long distances become an actuality when one fine day British generals arrive at Palanpur to lay railway tracks. The novel is a train journey through time and the railway is so endearingly presented that it feels like another character in the novel.

Caste calculus

For instance, as a train passes through Palanpur in 1932, its half-Dalit, half-British driver, George, blows the whistle triumphantly, as if registering his participation in a village wedding. The villagers react approvingly. Cut to 1984 and it is on a train that Anil befriends a man who, like a fortune-teller, repeatedly suggests that Anil must mingle more with Dalits in his quest to find the murderer. However things might change in Palanpur, caste hierarchies remain entrenched. As does the nature of control — Indian bureaucrats have taken over from colonial officers in managing the administration, but none is closer to understanding the people’s needs. The authors’ keen understanding of rural governance and the caste calculus dictating development priorities is in full bloom here. Should a school or a temple be constructed in the village? To get government funds, the villagers go in circles, meeting a variety of officials from ADO, BDO, CDO to KDO — the authors don’t open out the abbreviations, giving them an ominous ring.

The authors’ training in economics can be felt when an academic writing style surfaces, perhaps subconsciously. Some of the characters from the 1984 period could have been fleshed out a bit more at the cost of some characters from history. That said, the plot is well-knit, ironies abound, and there are delightful self-referential digs at economists and researchers. For instance, a self-proclaimed “expert” on poverty refuses to walk in the village fearing that his shoes will get dirty. He justifies his position by saying that it “implicitly confirmed that social change was best seen as a long-term objective”.

The protagonist, the 1980s’ rural setting and wit might suggest parallels with Upamanyu Chatterjee’s English, August. But unlike Agastya Sen, who is preoccupied with sex, Anil is more bothered about farming and the murder.

One need not rattle off statistics and jargon to bring out the inextricable relationship between caste, power and government bias. This novel proves that a work of fiction rooted in reality can do the job as effectively.

308,2020/10/24,Poirot at 100,"Neither grey cells nor lustrous moustache have at all dimmed in glory

July 28, 1914. The First World War has broken out. Germany invades Belgium and turns millions homeless. Evicted from their homeland, Belgians seek asylum in England. A bus full of Belgian refugees reaches Torquay in 1915. Among these shell-shocked refugees is a man named Jacques Hornais. With his diminutive figure, eccentric gait, egg-shaped bald pate and extravagant moustache, he turns heads around the terminus. It transpires he is a police officer, recently retired.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

In a Torquay town hall, meanwhile, a young woman named Agatha Miller (she would later marry Archibald Christie, a military officer) is working as nurse and dispensing chemist. Soon, at a fund-raising programme held for war emigrants, Agatha, performing as a solo pianist, spots Hornais.

And when she starts writing crime novels in 1916, she instinctively homes in on the man she would now cast as her detective. She says in her autobiography, “I settled on the Belgian detective. I allowed him slowly to grow into his part. He should have been an inspector, so that he would have a certain knowledge of crime. He would be meticulous, very tidy... And he should be brainy — he should have little grey cells of the mind... Yes, he would have little grey cells.”

Stickler for order

Disregarding the influence of Sherlock Holmes, Arsène Lupin and Joseph Rouletabille, Agatha formed a unique detective. He would be a stickler for order and method and follow the prompts of his little grey cells rather than analyse footprints or cigar ash.

Growing up a loner and subsequently working with wounded soldiers, Agatha had developed a set of incisive eyes. And shaping her protagonist, she spontaneously came up with someone who would solve crimes with astute observation and knowledge of human psychology.

While naming the sleuth, Agatha fancied Hercules, the mythical Greek hero, an embodiment of brawn and brain. But, perhaps in deference to her detective’s 5’4” height, she decided to remove the ‘s’. She arrived at the famous surname by merging the names of two fictional detectives — Hercule Popeau and Monsieur Jules Poiret.

A hundred years have passed since the creation of Hercule Poirot. The Mysterious Affairs at Styles was published by John Lane in the U.S. in October 1920 and in the U.K. by The Bodley Head (John Lane’s UK branch) in January 1921. A runway success, it’s odd to think now that the manuscript was rejected many times before.

The “dear little man” subsequently appeared in numerous crime novels and short stories, and three plays by Christie, conquering hearts the world over. His popularity continues even today: for most readers, solving crime with the diminutive, dapper detective is like taking part in a feast of suspense. The more we dig in, the more we get addicted.

Mysterious Affairs got praise from high quarters. The Pharmaceutical Journal wrote: “This detective story has dealt with poisons in a knowledgeable way, and not with the nonsense about untraceable substances that so often happens. Agatha Christie knows her job.” Christie’s days as apothecary’s assistant had paid off.

I am the best

Poirot’s primary attraction was his way of detection, which was quite unlike any followed by his peers in the genre until then. The detective got into the mind not only of the murderer but also the victim to solve the crimes.

Christie was as much psychologist as writer. Some of Poirot’s observations speak of her intimate knowledge of the human mind, such as when he says, “She might have trusted you. But Mademoiselle Katherine has spent a great deal of her life listening, and those who have listened do not find it easy to talk; they keep their sorrows and joys to themselves and tell no one” (The Mystery of the Blue Train).

But creators often come to hate what they have made. As Poirot’s popularity kept soaring, Christie began to find him insufferable, calling him a “detestable, bombastic, tiresome, egocentric little creep”. She would eventually kill him off in Curtain: Poirot’s Last Case.

What made her so uneasy about the character she had created novel by novel, tale by tale, play by play? Did she feel bested by her own detective? One is not quite sure. We do know that Poirot himself would have had no doubts about it. We are always left with an image of the little man doffing his hat: “‘Rest assured,’ said Hercule Poirot. ‘I am the best!”’

309,2020/10/24,A thousand suns of empathy: The poetry of Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri,"A pioneer of modern Malayalam literature, Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri was a philosopher-poet with a deep moral vision

For more than 70 years, until his death aged 94 on October 15, Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri was a transformational figure in Malayalam poetry. Yet, his familiar image was that of a soft-spoken, self-effacing personality who preferred to stay out of the limelight. When he heard the news that he had been chosen for the Jnanpith Award in 2019, Akkitham — as he was widely known — reacted with the comment, “My great contemporaries, Vyloppilly Sreedhara Menon and Edasseri Govindan Nair, were equally deserving of the award. Maybe I am now blessed with the honour as I have had a longer life.” That was quintessential Akkitham.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, book excerpts, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

Akkitham was a product of the literary churn that took place in Kerala in the first half of the 20th century, which saw Malayalam poetry evolve into a people’s movement. Hundreds began experimenting with the craft, and poetry was in the air everywhere, in dedicated gatherings and recitals, in antakshari sessions on the sidelines of temple festivals, in the verse epistles that became a popular form of correspondence. Kumaran Asan and Changampuzha Krishna Pillai were the folk heroes of the period. They chose themes that touched ordinary lives and spoke of their struggles in an unequal society.

Two phases

Deeply religious, Akkitham’s spiritualism was, however, part of a wider human vision. The Namboothiri community to which he belonged was in ferment, no longer enjoying the unchallenged spiritual and social dominance that had once been theirs and facing the onslaught of modern ideas. The revolution came from within when younger members of the community, led by E.M.S. Namboodiripad and V.T. Bhattathiripad, took a reformist path. Akkitham chose to join the movement, and this involvement had a great impact on his poetic life.

His poetic career can be divided into two phases. In the early years, when he had an ideological affinity with the Left movement, his verse sensitively captured the pain, prejudices and exploitations that abounded in Kerala’s feudal society as well as its slow disintegration over the years. ‘The Wet Clod’, a poem on the agrarian struggle in Kerala, was a product of this phase. His genius, however, steadily evolved to take a broader view of the modern human condition. Akkitham came to see a moral vacuum in contemporary life and society, which he attributed to a deterioration of human values in an incredibly divided and uneven world.

Unfettered creativity

Two of his most celebrated poems, ‘Epic of the Twentieth Century’ and ‘Broken, Shattered World’, were creations of this phase of his poetic journey. It is here that he matures into the role of a philosopher-poet. In both the poems, he pleads for restoration of compassion and generosity as essential elements of good living. The ‘Epic of the Twentieth Century’ opens with these oft-quoted lines.

‘As I shed a teardrop for others, There rise within me a thousand suns.’

This broader human concern resonates in most of the poems he wrote during this time.

Akkitham’s literary style deserves mention. While he wrote on complex issues that define human life, he never gave the impression that he was imposing any lofty wisdom on his readers. His craft was disciplined and his language penetrating.

He treasured his long-standing friendship with M.T. Vasudevan Nair, another superstar of Malayalam literature. It’s one of the rare coincidences of history that these two Jnanpith laureates attended the same small village school in Kumaranellur in Palakkad. They maintained a warm friendship over the years.

Last year’s Jnanpith came on top of every one of Kerala’s major literary awards. The nation had also honoured him with a Padma Shri in 2017. Even as he advanced in years, Akkitham never let age fetter his creativity. His translation of Shrimad Bhagavatam from Sanskrit into Malayalam, published in 2002, was a monumental effort running into 2,400 pages, a product of painstaking scholarship and dedication. Right up to the end, Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri glittered in Malayalam literature.

310,2020/10/24,"‘Stoned, Shamed, Depressed’ review: Why teenagers in urban India are dazed and confused","A journalist studies the lives of children and finds them troubled, addicted to social media, and often victims of cyberbullying and body-shaming

Last year, a young man in Delhi rolled his brand-new car into the Yamuna river. The reason: his parents had only bought him a Jaguar, not the BMW that he had demanded. This should have been a moment for India’s point zero one per cent to stop in their tracks and introspect. But they didn’t even blink.

Jyotsna Mohan Bhargava’s book steps into the lives of India’s privileged urban teenagers and emerges with an alarming report card: troubled kids, substance abuse, internet addiction, cyberbullying, body-shaming, and mental health issues.

‘Overstimulated and entitled’

Granted, she is writing about a small segment of pampered urban adolescents. It is also not as if the teenagers have suddenly gone berserk on their own — the grown-ups who are responsible for them have. Overstimulated and entitled as the young people are, at least they have the excuse that they are still young; it is the parents who gift their children everything, from pre-teen swimsuit shoots to hair-raising trips to Goa, from expensive phones and Mini Coopers to lip fillers and breast implants. The parents have no excuse.

There is also the small matter of the world in which we live. Tolstoy said that the role of educating a generation is played not by school, but by life. Life today teaches young people to gaze blankly at 24-hour news cycles or into the mirror, and to obsess for hours on social media, all the while ignoring the world outside — pandemic, melting icecaps, growing inequality and more.

Peer pressure

So, teenagers tend to get a bad rap, but they are still children. The teenage years are a time of sudden physical, mental and emotional changes. Hormones change with the onset of puberty. In social interactions, teenagers come under new kinds of peer pressure. They must manage additional schoolwork, looming board exams and career choices. They feel the weight of parents’ expectations. At the same time, they are tempted to take risks and try new experiences. Some of them suffer stress and self-doubt. They become conscious about body image. Through all these challenges, they are developing their own personality and perspectives on the world. Like awkward young birds, barely grown from chicks, they are taking their uncertain steps to the edge of the cliff — from where they must leap into the air and fly on their own.

Teaching them young

Parents can do a great deal to keep their kids grounded even in this age of rapid change. For a start, they can remain grounded themselves. They can talk to their kids regularly and convey positive messages — a hug, a fist-bump, or just showing up at a football match. They can also say no, often, and firmly, to absurd whims and demands.

Finally, they can also ask them to look around at other teenagers who are struggling in a very different reality: a young girl cycling to her village hundreds of kilometres away, with her injured father; another girl running after thugs who tried to steal her cellphone; yet another girl working with her family at a brick kiln in a faraway state, uploading photos on social media to appeal for rescue from modern-day bondage. They, too, are India’s teenagers.

311,2020/10/24,‘And We Came Outside and Saw the Stars Again’ review: Another age of calamity,"Fear, dread, hope, empathy — writers across the globe chronicle their thoughts on the raging coronavirus

As COVID-19 numbers began to be thrown around the world together with adjectives like ‘unprecedented’, writers responded to the pandemic by “interweaving words”. After all, that’s what literature does well, says Ilan Stavans in his introduction to And We Came Outside and Saw the Stars Again: championing nuance while resisting the easy tricks of generalization.

Quarantine in Gaza

Fifty writers have contributed to the anthology, representing 35 countries and “arriving in about a dozen languages”. Their accounts take in all aspects of a rampaging pandemic: fear, dread, helplessness, hope, past, present, future — and how the “reminder of Death brings reminders of Life.” If Jhumpa Lahiri writes an impassioned letter in Italian to the country she has adopted, for journalist Majed Abusalama, born and raised in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza, the lockdown reminds him of the Intifada (uprising) and lockdowns, curfews and a variety of restrictions. Living in Berlin, his mind wanders to Gaza and the Jabalia camp “which has 113,000 people living in an area that covers a bit more than half a sq km.”

The virus on the prowl leads Peru’s Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa to conclude that for human beings “what will never pass is our fear of death, of the afterlife...” He wonders why it is difficult for mankind “to accept that all of life’s beauty... belong ultimately to death, and that at any moment it may all come to an end.” In her letter, translated into English by Alta L. Price, Lahiri thanks Italy for the gift of perspective, “an example of what to do, how to be and how to get through this.”

Nature beckons

The title, points out Stavans, is inspired by the last line of Dante’s Inferno — in which the poet and Virgil emerge from their journey through hell to once again view the beauty of the heavens. Other lines from Divine Comedy make up the titles of the five parts which deals with the eruption of the virus, the need for a roadmap, on empathy, hope and the future.

Some writers chronicle the immediate impact of the lockdown on nature. Claire Messud hears the earth breathing around her, and Frederika Randall, the writer and translator who died this May in Rome, tries to understand what the birds are saying. Others like Arshia Sattar cannot help thinking that the “paranoid dystopias” that she had read when she was younger (Franz Kafka, George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Yevgyeny Zamyatin) have become the “gross brutal reality” now.

The last word, however, must go to Sudanese artist and cartoonist Khalid Albaih, who is based in Copenhagen. Tossing out the meaning of the phrase ‘new normal’, he says lockdowns and restrictions are an ‘old normal’ for millions of black and brown people. The new normal he dreams about is social justice, equality, and solidarity. Or to Juan Villoro, author of God is Round who finds it ironic that the world’s governments are slashing funds for culture, when people may be surviving the lockdown, thanks to the arts: “Civilisation began around a fire. The world’s governments should know that it served three essential purposes: warming hands, cooking and telling stories.”

312,2020/10/24,‘The Greatest Ode to Lord Ram: Tulsidas’s Ramcharitmanas’ review: India’s cultural inheritance,"In this retelling of Tulsidas’s classic, diplomat and politician Pavan Varma explains that the secular ideals of ‘Ramrajya’ should not be overlooked

India’s relationship with Ram has become very complex. Lord Ram is a widely revered Hindu deity. In the realm of mass culture, as Jawaharlal Nehru himself noted in his Discovery of India, the influence of the Ramayana and Mahabharata has remained unparalleled. Furthermore, as a result of the long process of syncretism and Indianisation of Islam, many Muslims also respect Ram. For example, Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khana, known as the ‘bhakti’ poet Rahim (1556-1627), who was one of Akbar’s ‘navaratnas’, wrote thus in praise of Ram: “Gahi sarnagati Ram ki, bhavsagar ki naav / Rahiman jagat udhar ko, aur na kachhu upaiy” (The only way to achieve salvation is through unconditional surrender to Ram).

Ominous trend

Yet, in recent times, Ram has been controversialised by two intellectual and political trends. A section of educated Hindus, influenced by atheistic Marxism, have a negative opinion about the Ramayana and many other patrimonies of Hinduism. Their propagation of secularism in anti-Hindu terms has now received a strong pushback from India’s majority community. On a convergent track, much of the Dalit movement inspired by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar (in particular, by his book Riddle of Rama and Krishna) is fiercely critical of the two Hindu epics and their main characters. A far more consequential and ominous development has been the Ram Janmabhoomi movement launched by the RSS-led Hindutva Parivar. By politicising, communalising and, indeed, weaponising Ram, it has divided Indian society in a bid to consolidate a Hindu vote bank big enough for the BJP to remain in power indefinitely. It aims to use its political power to establish a Hindu supremacist nation that marginalises non-Hindus.

It is in this context that we should view the enormous usefulness of Pavan Varma’s new contribution to the Ramayana literature in English —The Greatest Ode to Lord Ram: Tulsidas’s Ramcharitmanas. An eminent scholar, diplomat and politician, Varma has authored a book that challenges the anti-Hindu critics of Ram as well as the anti-Muslim Hindu right.

Mahatma Gandhi, the greatest and truest Ram bhakt in modern India, regarded Ramcharitmanas by Sant Tulsidas (1532-1623) “as the greatest book in all devotional literature”. He said, “My Ram, the Ram of our prayers, is not the historical Ram, the King of Ayodhya. He is the eternal, the unborn, the one without a second. Call him Ishwara, Allah, God, Ahura Mazda. His names are innumerable. He is timeless, formless, stainless. Him alone I worship.” The Ram that emerges from Tulsi’s classic is no different. His Ramayana is not an embellished mythological story; it is a profound elucidation of the spiritual, philosophical and ethical teachings that have in many ways defined our civilisation.

Four pillars

The most instructive chapter in the book, also the longest, is about the meaning of Ramrajya. “Was Tulsi’s vision of Ramrajya secular?” Varma poses this question, and answers it affirmatively.

“In Tulsi’s definition of Ramrajya, righteousness prevails, supported by the four pillars of truth, purity, compassion and charity,” which, we must note, are also the pillars of every religion. Ramrajya is “a kingdom in which there is no violence, there are equal rights for everyone... and all people are bound by mutual love — sab nara karahin paraspar priti”. Tulsi’s Ramrajya may sound utopian. It may even seem imperfect from some modern perspectives. Nevertheless, it is largely free from the taint of injustice. Such a kingdom would not be “an exclusively Hindu State”, Varma avers. “It would work to create a harmonious society, respecting people of all faiths.”

The book’s virtues, however, go far beyond contemporary controversies. One of the greatest strengths of Ramcharitmanas (which means ‘the splendid lake of Ram’s character’) is that it illuminates “the philosophical intricacies of Hinduism” in “a lyrical outpouring”.

Like all the great Bhakti poet-saints born in different parts of India, Tulsi synthesises the apparent “dichotomy between a ‘nirguna’ (attributeless Absolute) and ‘saguna’ (attribute-full) deity”. He harmonises another important dichotomy — the diversity of castes and social groups. Tulsi also “overarches the schism between the Shivaite and Vaishnavite schools, and projects a harmony where Hinduism is seen as a holistic unity.”

People outside north India cannot perhaps imagine the profound impact of Ramcharitmanas on common people. Tulsidas, who lived his early life in Ayodhya and died in Kashi, achieved this feat due mainly to three factors.

First, the masses were influenced by his message of bhakti or absolute devotion as the path to reach the lord, as against the ‘jnana marg’, the path of knowledge.

Second, he is unsparing in rebuking human follies, but does so in a way that is gentle and educative, not retributive. Third, and most important, his poetry in Awadhi (not in Sanskrit) is animated by a unique combination of beauty, simplicity and divinity, because of which it is chanted even today, both in individual prayers and mass devotional assemblies.

When an epic is thus treasured in the hearts, minds and on the lips of the multitudes, century after century, it must not be despised. Rather, it should be used to reform our state, society and citizens to bring them closer to the ideal of Ramrajya.

313,2020/10/24,Study predicts massive habitat decline for the Himalayan brown bear by 2050 due to climate change,"There is a need for preemptive spatial planning of protected areas for the long-term viability of the species, says lead author

A recent study on the Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus) has predicted a significant reduction in suitable habitat and biological corridors of the species in the climate change scenario, prompting scientists to suggest an adaptive spatial planning of protected area network in the western Himalayas for conserving the species.

The Himalayan brown bear is one of the largest carnivores in the highlands of Himalayas. It occupies the higher reaches of the Himalayas in remote, mountainous areas of Pakistan and India, in small and isolated populations, and is extremely rare in many of its ranges.

The study carried out in the western Himalayas by scientists of Zoological Survey of India, predicted a massive decline of about 73% of the bear’s habitat by the year 2050.

A publication titled ‘Adaptive spatial planning of protected area network for conserving the Himalayan brown bear’ with the details of the study has recently been published in an international science journal.

“These losses in habitat will also result in loss of habitat from 13 protected areas (PAs), and eight of them will become completely uninhabitable by the year 2050, followed by loss of connectivity in the majority of PAs. Furthermore, simulation suggests a significant qualitative decline in remaining habitats of the species within the protected areas of the landscape,” Lalit Sharma, head of wildlife section of ZSI and the lead author of the study, said.

Dr. Sharma said that in such a situation when the protected areas in the Himalayan region lose their effectiveness and representativeness, there is a need to adopt “preemptive spatial planning of PAs in the Himalayan region for the long-term viability of the species”.

“The suitable habitats were mapped outside the PAs and are closely placed to PAs; such areas may be prioritized to bring them into the PA network or enhanced protection,” the paper recommended.

Dr. Sharma explained that adaptive spatial planning of PAs is aimed at minimising the risks and uncertainty of climate change.

“We have taken the Himalayan brown bear as an example because it is a top carnivore of the high-altitude Himalayan region. The elevation gradient in which the brown bear is distributed is most vulnerable to global warming as this elevation belt is getting warmer faster than other elevation zones of Himalayas,” he added.

“For species like Himalayan brown bear, which are found in the western Himalayas, such studies are very crucial as the habitat of such species is highly vulnerable to climate and unless we plan in advance, we cannot sustain its population in future,” Kailash Chandra, director of ZSI, said.

Dr. Chandra added that adaptive spatial planning broadly refers to conserving the existing landscape and augmenting the fragmented areas of the habitat of the species.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cs1l0f/article32935964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201023-WA0020jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/study-predicts-massive-habitat-decline-for-the-himalayan-brown-bear-by-2050-due-to-climate-change/article32935974.ece

315,2020/10/24,"Room temperature superconductivity, possible but under severe pressure","A new material composed of carbon, hydrogen and sulphur superconducts at 15 degrees Celsius

Starting from hydrogen sulphide, infamous for its rotten-egg smell, a group of researchers at University of Rochester, Intel corporation and University of Nevada in the U.S. have created a material that is superconducting at 15 degrees Celsius. That is, it shows zero resistance to the flow of electricity through it. Such a material would have hitherto unheard of applications from power supplies to quantum computers. The only caveat is that it needs ultrahigh pressure of about 2 million atmospheres to achieve this transition, putting off any thoughts of application to the future. The research, published in Nature, has sparked off animated discussions in the world of physics.

“Ever since Wigner and Huntington (1935) predicted that solid hydrogen can be metallised by application of a pressure of about 25 Gigapascal (GPa), the high-pressure physics community has been after metallisation of hydrogen,” says G. Baskaran, Distinguished Professor of Physics at IIT Madras and Distinguished Visiting Research Chair at Perimeter Institute, Waterloo, Canada, who is an expert in the field of superconductivity. “Ashcroft (1968) gave a new impetus to this search and suggested that within conventional BCS mechanism of superconductivity, in view of light mass of H atom, superconducting Tc of metallic hydrogen will reach room temperature scales,” explains Prof. Baskaran

Breakthrough

In 2015, a breakthrough happened when a group led by M.I. Eremets managed to apply pressure on hydrogen sulphide and get a superconductor at 200 kelvin (minus 73 degrees Celsius). Prof. Baskaran adds, “It was followed by superconductivity in few more hydride superconductors. Until recently, the record holder was Lanthanum superhydride (LaH10). Its Tc is about 250 K, which is room temperatures in polar regions!”.

The researchers made three tests to verify that this phase was indeed a superconductor: First, they measured resistance as a function of temperature and found that it did fall to a vanishingly small value below the critical temperature, Tc. A true superconductor would, if placed in a magnetic field, try to push out the field from its interior. This is called perfect diamagnetism, and the group ascertained that the magnetic susceptibility was that of a diamagnet.

Thirdly, it is known that sufficiently high magnetic fields can destroy superconductivity in a material. The researchers applied high magnetic fields up to 9 tesla and showed the suppression of the transition temperature to lower and lower values as the magnetic field increased. If you extrapolate this relationship, they show that at around 62 tesla the magnetic field would destroy the superconductivity completely.

Commenting on the high pressure that was needed to create this material, Ranga P. Dias, from the University of Rochester and the corresponding author of the paper, says in an email to The Hindu that the pressure they needed was 267 Gigapascals, or 2.6 million atmospheres. “The pressure at the centre of the Earth is 360 GPa, so it is 75% of the pressure at centre of the Earth,” he adds.

Diamond jaws

They achieved this by squeezing a tiny volume of the substance between the jaws of a diamond anvil. “We have broken many diamonds. It’s very challenging to keep this material to very high pressure because of the hydrogen diffusion,” he reveals.

While they know that the substance is a metal in the normal state, they do not know much about its structure. This is because it is needed to study it using x-ray diffraction and that does not work in this system. “The next challenge will be to produce these materials that are stable (or metastable) at ambient pressure via ‘compositional tuning’ so they will be even more economical to mass produce,” says Dr. Dias.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/bcicuw/article32937246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-SCISupercond-LABjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/room-temperature-superconductivity-possible-but-under-severe-pressure/article32937247.ece
316,2020/10/24,Question corner | Why is fish smell unpleasant for some people?,"Readers may send their questions/answers to questioncorner@thehindu.co.in

Researchers have found that some people carry a mutation in a particular gene that makes fish odour less intense. An olfactory receptor gene called trace amine-associated receptor 5 (TAAR5) was pinpointed as the reason for this smell variation.

The study conducted in Iceland involved examining the olfactory genes in humans. A sniff test was conducted for over 9,000 people. Participants were asked to smell odours from pen-like devices. After sniffing each pen, the researchers asked what the smell was, the intensity, and the pleasantness of that smell. They sniffed key ingredients found in licorice, cinnamon, fish etc. The TAAR5 variant affects perception of fish odour containing trimethylamine, a compound found in rotten and fermented fish. In the smell tests, those participants who have the gene variant were more likely to not smell anything when presented with the fish odour or could only smell it with less intensity and often named the odour incorrectly.

The results were published in Current Biology. A note from Cell Press adds that while humans have fewer olfactory genes compared to other species, some of the genetic variations that people do carry makes them more sensitive to particular smells such as licorice or cinnamon, not less. The researchers say they will continue to collect data on odour perception and have also planned to investigate the smell deficits in COVID-19 patients",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/r3gck2/article32937233.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-SCIFISHjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/smell-a-fish/article32937234.ece
317,2020/10/24,How an asymptomatic player turned super-spreader,"A single index player in a baseball game spread the virus to 20 other players of his team, but probably not on the field

The importance of testing asymptomatic persons for novel coronavirus and the import of mitigation strategies to decrease the spread of the virus have been highlighted in a super-spreading event involving team A that participated in the Major League Baseball matches in Philadelphia in end-June. A single index player spread the virus to 20 other players of his team and to one employee of team B. The results were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).

Health protocols

The Major League Baseball developed new health and safety protocols before the July 24 start of the 2020 season based on CDC’s COVID-19 mitigation recommendations related to events and gatherings. These include non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mask wearing and social distancing, frequent (every other day) testing for rapid identification of people infected with the virus before they exhibited symptoms and isolation of the infected and quarantining of close contacts. In addition, the games were played without spectators.

Despite multiple mitigation strategies, including that testing of each player every alternate day was in place, the spread of the virus to other players could not be prevented. This was primarily because the virus spread during the asymptomatic phase of infection. To prevent further spread by asymptomatic players, the Major League Baseball initiated daily testing instead of alternate day testing for all players belonging to team A and B for the duration of the outbreak. Frequent testing helped identify players infected with virus days before they started showing symptoms. “Among the 19 of 21 persons with COVID-19 who were symptomatic, symptoms developed an average of 2.3 days after collection of the test-positive sample,” says the team led by Dr. Meghan Murray from the Epidemic Intelligence Service, CDC which investigated the super-spreading event, in the paper in MMWR.

The index case, who was still asymptomatic, received a positive test result on day four of the games before a three-game series with team B. The result was based on a sample collected on day two. The index case was immediately isolated and all players of team A and staff members who were in close contact with the index cases were tested.

On day five, after the second game with team B, three more players of team A tested positive. The following day, an additional eight team A players and staff member of team B tested positive. In the following days, eight more players of team A tested positive.

Genome sequencing revealed that 17 of the 18 samples that were sequenced had a single nucleotide variant, revealing that the super-spreading event was from a single index case.

Outside the field

Despite team A playing five games in all, spending a cumulative 11 hours on the field, no player from team B or team C, coaches or umpires became infected. According to the study, the virus spread had occurred outside the field. “Interactions outside of on-field play were likely the source of spread, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk between baseball teams while on the playing field appeared low,” the authors write. The employee of team B who was infected had apparently closely interacted indoors with team A tier 1 employees who subsequently tested positive.

Additional support

“Social distancing measures have been effective in a variety of settings, and this outbreak provides additional support for their use during sporting events, such as baseball games,” the authors note. Universal mask-wearing policies provided additional protection for team mates. “Consistent adherence to these policies off-field also might have contributed to protecting the communities hosting the games,” they note.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/2j4jf9/article32937218.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-SCIPRASjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-an-asymptomatic-player-turned-super-spreader/article32937219.ece
318,2020/10/24,Problems with the Indian supermodel for COVID-19,"Basing public health policy on flawed models can be dangerous

We predict the future by extrapolating from the present, based on what we’ve learnt from the past. To estimate how many cases of COVID-19 will be seen in India two months from now, we must have an idea of the number of people who are currently infected. For this, we must know the trajectory of the disease in the past as well as understand how infected people spread the disease to those as yet uninfected. Mathematical models describe this understanding in terms of equations, using input from epidemiologists. These can be used to make predictions for the future.

Some months ago, the Indian government’s top science agency, Department of Science and Technology (DST), decided that it would support the development of a single “supermodel” for COVID-19 in India. This would combine the best features of models from India and worldwide. A high-level committee was set up to do this, composed of eminent scientists, including several epidemiologists. The report of the committee, in the form of a presentation of the National Supermodel Committee and a paper that was fast-tracked in the Indian Journal of Medical Research, are now available.

Let’s divide the report into two broad parts. The first part contains general recommendations for India. The eminence of the panel adds weight to them. It warns that the gains of the past several months can be dissipated if distancing measures are reduced in the upcoming festival season. It stresses that continued attention to masking is critical. It suggests that, provided we pay attention to these, India may hope to enter the new year without seeing any further sustained increase in the number of cases. All these points are almost certainly valid. All the members of the supermodel committee have signed on to this part of the report.

The second is the work described in the published paper about the supermodel. Only three members of the committee are authors of this paper. The authors are an eminent computer scientist, an applied mathematician famous for work in control theory and a distinguished ex-army officer with a medical background. All are well known names. None are epidemiologists, even though the committee as a whole possessed this expertise.

First, the supermodel assumes something unusual. All generally accepted models for COVID-19 so far assume that everyone is equally susceptible to it. Nothing we know suggests that this should not be the case. However, an unusual feature of COVID-19 is that some fraction of people infected with the virus do not display symptoms, while being able to infect others. About 30-60% of those infected, perhaps more, are such asymptomatic carriers of infection. Why this is so is still unknown. The supermodel takes a new route that virtually no other model takes. It assumes that the population prior to infection can be divided into two separate parts. One part will always be either asymptomatically infected while the other will always exhibit symptoms. The supermodel assumes that “immunity levels, genetic disposition and co-morbidities” might determine this assignment. The truth is, we just don’t know this.

Testable consequence

This choice, however, has one specific testable consequence. If we took a random sub-set of people, say healthcare workers drawn from the general population, we should then expect to see the same proportion of asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients in them as in the general population.

This is not what is seen. Around the world, healthcare workers are at more risk of severe infection and death than members of the general population. This suggests that it is the amount of exposure to the virus that may be important in determining whether an individual will exhibit symptoms.

More parameters

A second point is the following: A model should have as few numbers as possible that must be provided by the modeller to describe the data (they’re called parameters). For virtually all such models, such parameters must be estimated. The more the number of parameters, the larger the significance of uncertainties in these numbers, even as more parameters provide more flexibility. The supermodel ostensibly has just four parameters. It fits the count of new cases well, reproducing the recent peak in Indian cases as well as the two peaks that Delhi saw.

Let’s dig a little deeper. The model divides the period between the start of the pandemic and the date at which the results were obtained into six parts. These four parameters all take different values in each of these parts. This gives 24 parameters in all, all separately varied to fit the case count. These parameters are not constrained in any way by an understanding of COVID-19 epidemiology.

Worse, some of the parameters are then varied across a large range, from 67 to 4,75,000 in one case. There is no justification provided for this. It makes little sense to have so many parameters, all changing, in a model. Indeed, a famous quote from the mathematician John von Neumann applies here: “With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk”.

Lives at stake

There are many more problems with both the model and the conclusions it arrives at. However, just this discussion should indicate that the government’s supermodel is ill-suited to address questions of COVID-19 spread in India. Basing public health policies on models that are flawed is dangerous, since the lives of people are at stake and false optimism carries risks with it. Science should not serve political ends.

There are better models. Choosing this one to be India’s ‘supermodel’ presents a misleading picture of India's capabilities in both epidemiology and modelling, to Indians as well as to the rest of the world.

319,2020/10/24,Evidence of dairy production in the Indus Valley Civilisation,"Traces indicate that milk may have been boiled before consumption

The year 2020 marks 100 years of discovery of Indus Valley Civilisation, and a new study has shown that dairy products were being produced by the Harappans as far back as 2500 BCE.

By analysing residues on ancient pots, researchers show the earliest direct evidence of dairy product processing, thus throwing fresh light on the rural economy of the civilisation. The studies were carried out on 59 shards of pottery from Kotada Bhadli, a small archeological site in present-day Gujarat.

“When we talk about Harappans, we always refer to the metropolitan cities and the big towns. But we have no idea of the parallel economy — agro-pastoral or rural. We know they had great urban planning, trading systems, jewellery making. But we don't have any idea how the common masters were living during the Harappan times, their lifestyle and how they were contributing in the larger network,” explains Prabodh Shirvalkar, from the Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology at the Deccan College Postgraduate and Research Institute, Pune. He is one of the authors of the papers published in Scientific Reports.

Carbon isotope studies

The team used molecular analysis techniques to study the residues from ancient pottery. “Pots are porous. So as soon as we put any liquid form of food, it will absorb it. The pot preserves the molecules of food such as fats and proteins. Using techniques like C16 and C18 analysis we can identify the source of lipids,” adds Kalyan Sekhar Chakraborty, the first author of the paper, from the Department of Anthropology, University of Toronto, Canada.

When asked if this proves that the Harappans made curd and cheese, Dr. Chakraborty adds: “It is very difficult to pinpoint. Traces were seen in cooking vessels indicating that milk may have been boiled and consumed. We also found residues in a bowl showing that either heated milk or curd could have been served. There are also remains of a perforated vessel, and similar vessels were used in Europe to make cheese. So it is possible that they were further processing milk into different forms.”

Animal husbandry

The team was also able to show which type of animals were being used for dairy production. They studied the tooth enamel from fossils of cattle, water buffalo, goat and sheep found in the area. Cows and water buffalo were found to consume millets, while sheep and goats ate nearby grass and leaves. A preliminary study suggested that most of the cattle and water-buffalo died at an older age, suggesting they could have been raised for milk, whereas the majority of goat/sheep died when they were young, indicating they could have been used for meat.

“The Harappans did not just use dairy for their household. The large herd indicates that milk was produced in surplus so that it could be exchanged and there could have been some kind of trade between settlements. This could have given rise to an industrial level of dairy exploitation,” adds Dr. Chakraborty.

He concludes: “The most fascinating thing about the Indus Valley Civilisation is that it is faceless — there is no king, no bureaucratic organisations, but there are these very close regional interactions between settlements, a symbiotic relationship of give and take that helped the civilisation survive for so long.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/yzuvbc/article32937154.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-SCIHARAPPANPNG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/evidence-of-dairy-production-in-the-indus-valley-civilisation/article32937155.ece

Antibodies that can bind to more than one distinct antigen are called polyreactive and these could help develop a universal vaccine against influenza virus. By analysing more than 500 antibodies induced by various influenza vaccines and infections, the team was able to find the antibodies that were polyreactive. More studies will determine if these antibodies can be leveraged safely to produce the vaccine.

321,2020/10/24,Asteroid samples leaking from jammed NASA spacecraft,"Because of the sudden turn of events, scientists won’t know how much the sample capsule holds until it’s back on Earth.

A NASA spacecraft is stuffed with so much asteroid rubble from this week’s grab that it’s jammed open and precious particles are drifting away in space, scientists said Friday.

Scientists announced the news three days after the spacecraft named Osiris-Rex briefly touched asteroid Bennu, NASA’s first attempt at such a mission.

The mission’s lead scientist, Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona, said Tuesday’s operation 200 million miles away collected far more material than expected for return to Earth — in the hundreds of grams.

The sample container on the end of the robot arm penetrated so deeply into the asteroid and with such force, however, that rocks got sucked in and became wedged around the rim of the lid.

Scientists estimate the sampler pressed as much as 48 centimeters into the rough, crumbly, black terrain. “We’re almost a victim of our own success here,” Lauretta said at a hastily arranged news conference.

Lauretta said there is nothing flight controllers can do to clear the obstructions and prevent more bits of Bennu from escaping, other than to get the samples into their return capsule as soon as possible.

So, the flight team was scrambling to put the sample container into the capsule as early as Tuesday — much sooner than originally planned — for the long trip home. “Time is of the essence,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, chief of NASA’s science missions.

This is NASA’s first asteroid sample-return mission. Bennu was chosen because its carbon-rich material is believed to hold the preserved building blocks of our solar system. Getting pieces from this cosmic time capsule could help scientists better understand how the planets formed billions of years ago and how life originated on Earth.

Scientists were stunned — and then dismayed — on Thursday when they saw the pictures coming from Osiris-Rex following its wildly successful touch-and-go at Bennu two days earlier.

A cloud of asteroid particles could be seen swirling around the spacecraft as it backed away from Bennu. The situation appeared to stabilize, according to Lauretta, once the robot arm was locked into place. But it was impossible to know exactly how much had already been lost.

The requirement for the $800 million-plus mission was to bring back a minimum 60 grams.

Regardless of what’s on board, Osiris-Rex will still leave the vicinity of the asteroid in March — that’s the earliest possible departure given the relative locations of Earth and Bennu. The samples won’t make it back until 2023, seven years after the spacecraft rocketed away from Cape Canaveral.

Osiris-Rex will keep drifting away from Bennu and will not orbit it again, as it waits for its scheduled departure.

Because of the sudden turn of events, scientists won’t know how much the sample capsule holds until it’s back on Earth. They initially planned to spin the spacecraft to measure the contents, but that maneuver was canceled since it could spill even more debris. “I think we’re going to have to wait until we get home to know precisely how much we have,” Lauretta told reporters. “As you can imagine, that’s hard. ... But the good news is we see a lot of material.”

322,2020/10/24,A Dhoni fan traces his journey from cricket to poker,"I have three passions in life – coding, cricket and country music. Cricket rates right at the top of this list, and one man who keeps the adrenaline going for me is MS Dhoni, whose cool captaincy and pizzazz with the bat has inspired me, always.

The bitter news that Dhoni was retiring from international cricket was tempered a bit by the fact that we would still see him in action in Twenty20 cricket in the days ahead. And then came news that Captain Cool has been trying his ace shots in another game – online poker! Come to think of it, there are quite a few similarities between a game of cricket and poker.

Both cricket and poker never fail to up the excitement quotient for players. Like cricket, poker is about getting a fair chance. Every player gets to showcase his skill in the game and of course, the best team/player wins! Naturally, the more you practise, the better you get. And that’s how I have been enthusiastic about the super game of skill, online poker! Is it any wonder why Dhoni would have been chosen to be the brand ambassador for PokerStars India?

There’s so much to learn from Dhoni, be it cricket or poker, which can be applicable to life and the challenges it throws at you! Here’s what I have learnt from MSD’s game over the years -

# Sportsmanship: Dhoni is a great sport and a true gentleman on the cricket battlefield. In the same vein, I want to emulate his sportsmanship and respect for cricket, by following the rules, respecting my fellow players’ abilities and playing by the book .

# Strategy and mind power: Cricket is a physical sport but it’s also about using your mind power. It is because of the way he employs strategy and planning that Dhoni is a cut above the rest. It is strategy that helped his team win the ICC World T20 in 2007 and the 2011 World Cup. Unconventional moves, quick thinking and anticipating my opponents’ moves are some ways I use my skills in planning and strategy to win a game at Spin-N-Go - a fast & thrilling format of poker!

# Nerves of Steel: It is not for nothing that the legendary cricketer is known as ‘Captain Cool’ and respected for his ability to stay composed at the most trying of times. Just like cricket, poker can test a person’s poise and attitude. This can sometimes make the difference between winning and losing. MSD has taught me to keep calm and focused, be it in poker or life!

# Never Give Up! It is true that both cricket and poker are not for the faint-hearted. That’s why, a person who can show his mettle and endure for long can come to the top in any championship. Dhoni’s fortitude has taught me that stamina is essential to stay in the game.

Of course, apart from these lessons from my icon, I have been honing my skills at PokerStars India’s online school in all my spare hours,just to take my game a few notches higher! With his deft moves in poker, Dhoni has demonstrated that any challenge can be met with skill and hard work, and it’s surely exciting times for his fans who want to follow his lead.

I, for one, am already battling it out on PokerStars India, matching wits with the best. How about you?",,https://www.thehindu.com/brandhub/x0p5em/article32936806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Brandhub,https://www.thehindu.com/brandhub/a-dhoni-fan-traces-his-journey-from-cricket-to-poker/article32936807.ece
323,2020/10/24,"Diwali 2020: Tips to make your home a healthy, happy space this festive season","We have foregone several festivities this year, preferring to shelter in place and stay safe rather than party in public with friends and family. The home has emerged as our sanctuary where we celebrate in peace in the company of our loved ones.

Holi, Raksha Bandhan, the Ganesh festival and Navratri have all been marked quietly. But now, the festive season of Diwali is just around the corner and it’s time we give our homes a makeover that doesn’t just give it a festive look but turns it into a healthier haven too!

There are several ways in which we can create, brighten and spruce up spaces within the home to create new nooks for working, ensure safety for children and create a shield against virus and bacteria attacks.

Here’s how you can do up the home during Diwali and make sure you enjoy the festive season at home with loved ones.

1. Transform your walls

Painting the walls this festive season will bring in the right mood for cheer and happiness. We have spent a large part of 2020 indoors and it’s time to brighten our walls with fresh paint and add some wall art that’s pleasing to the eyes.

Paint your house walls with Asian Paints’ range of products, Royale Health Shield and Royale Health Shield Clear. The Royale Health Shield is a revolutionary solution that can kill 99%# bacteria on painted surfaces within 2 hours of exposure. The Silver Ion Technology in the paint is even recommended* by the Indian Medical Association. A combination of hygiene and aesthetics offered by the Royale Health Shield range of products ensures a safe and beautiful home. The warm, vibrant colours of the walls will give your home the new look you have wanted all year!

2. Disinfect everything

A good practice worth inculcating indoors is disinfecting commonly used items like mobile phones, television remotes, dinner tables, doorknobs, sinks, laptops, electric switches, etc. Although we are cautious, there is a possibility we miss on covering up while sneezing or coughing. The best way to maintain high standards of hygiene is cleaning common surfaces with soap and water, followed by a disinfectant. Soap reduces the number of germs while disinfecting kills bacteria from surfaces. Diluted bleach solutions or alcohol-based liquids can be used to fight viruses and bacteria for a longer time.

3. Sanitize clothes

Change the towels, kitchen napkins, bed sheets, as frequently as possible. According to the US' Centre for Disease Control, it is advisable to use the warmest water setting, between 40 to 60 degree Celsius, to eliminate any bacteria or virus buildup within the layers of the fabric. Always dry clothes in the sun and avoid tumble dry. And make sure the clothes are thoroughly dried before getting them off the hangers.

4. Purify air at home

As we spend more time indoors, it is possible we breathe the same stale air, and air-conditioners are often cited as the reason for keeping pathogens locked inside the homes. Open your windows and ventilate rooms for at least 20 minutes multiple times a day to eliminate the concentration of bacteria and viruses in the house. The kitchen and the bathroom are spaces that benefit the most from a good airing. You could also opt for beeswax candles, salt crystal products to neutralize toxic compounds and contaminants in the air. Essential oils like eucalyptus, lemon, grapefruits, rosemary, etc. or the traditional camphor kill airborne bacteria and purify the air in the home.

5. Bring Nature into your home

Many house plants act as natural air filters. They are aesthetically pleasing and can boost our immunity and induce a feeling of wellbeing. Houseplants like Boston ferns purify air and help to remove compounds like formaldehyde, plastics or cigarette smoke from air. Peace lilies, that don’t need direct sunlight, can alsobreak down carbon monoxide and benzene. Aloe vera doesn’t just purify air, the gel of the aloe is loaded with vitamins, antioxidants and nutrients. Basil (tulsi) has tremendous anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties and can be added to salads and smoothies to boost your immune system! A balcony or a kitchen window is enough for you to make your home healthier!

This festive season, don’t just brighten up your home. Make it a healthier, happier dwelling for yourself and your loved ones all year long!
