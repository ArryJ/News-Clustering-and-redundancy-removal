Indian paddler Harmeet Desai is excited about playing in the French second division league beginning at Roanne on October 20.

The 27-year-old, who will turn out for Club-Loire Nord TTC, said: “I am quite excited and a bit anxious as well because I have not been away from competition for such a long time.

“I feel I am playing well in practice, but it will be totally different in a match. I hope everything will fall in place,” Harmeet told The Hindu from Surat on Friday.

Harmeet said he would be flying out on October 9. “Even if I am quarantined, I will still have time to get ready for the match. I heard that the quarantine period is one week and there will be no need for it if I test COVID-19 negative,” said Harmeet.

He revealed that he will travel to Ochsenhausen (Germany) after his second match in the French League on October 27.

“I will train in Ochsenhausen as it has one of the best training facilities in Europe before returning to Roanne in the third week of November,” said Harmeet, ranked 72nd in the world.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ban531/article32754324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03HARMEET,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/french-league-stint-excites-harmeet/article32754325.ece
1,2020/10/02,"Beware, I’ve changed my DP","The secret weapon that is stronger than any military arsenal

In October last year, a bunch of fearless freedom fighters voluntarily sacrificed 12 entire hours of their internet time — but not before changing their DPs — as a mark of solidarity for the internet blackout in Kashmir while I, uncaring **** that I am, spent much of that time Googling Kangana Ranaut’s quotes on patriotism.

The activists were bruised and battered, but, by god, they emerged triumphant from this gruelling, life-threatening ordeal that lasted for a nail-biting, spine-chilling, blood-curdling 43,200 seconds.

After sipping on tender coconut water and chilled watermelon juice (add gin or vodka to taste) to regain some of their depleted spirit, and being rewarded for their bravery with hundreds of heart emojis from other fearless friends, these warriors went back to the business at hand: responding with heart emojis on the selfies of fellow activists, spreading brotherly love, and basically showing us how it was done. Without ever leaving home.

What an eye-opener it was for a low fool like me. Here I was thinking satyagrahas were for Mahatmas, and my friends proved that to perform a new-age one, you could be a perfectly ordinary atma, didn’t have to leave home and, heck, you didn’t even need the principle ingredients: satya or agraha. All you needed was a phone. And a DP.

Today, the same lionhearted folks are back. They keep coming back despite the wounds, scars and PTSD because that’s how committed and selfless they are.

But for the current cause, take my word, they have pulled out all the stops.

Watch out, Patriarchy! Your days are numbered. My fiery friends are here, armed with the lethal ‘Let’s Smash Patriarchy’ T-shirts that they’ll sucker-punch you with in the solar plexus, and as you are wondering what hit you, finish you off with a (drum-roll) ‘Let’s Smash Patriarchy’ DP.

The way things are going, rumour has it that Patriarchy could soon ask for Y+ category security because it fears the T-shirts and the DPs could not just demolish its headquarters, but put its very life in danger.

What a massive booster-shot in the arm this must be for the women who have been fighting Patriarchy for centuries, no? As they board trains and buses — or are trudging barefoot — to schools, colleges, computer classes, hospitals, factories, shops, beauty parlours and upper-middle class households, to study, to work, to survive, they now go with the reassuring thought that Patriarchy’s achhe din are ending. Because the ever-vigilant wives, girlfriends, sisters and mothers of the principal practitioners of Patriarchy have changed their DPs, dammit. From their previous ones, taken in Paris or Panruti. And dumb, arrogant Patriarchy didn’t see it coming, LOL. The sheer suddenness of the move, the unexpected nature of the move, the unpredictability of the move.

I want to take this opportunity to thank these stoic souls who have given up this sacred space, the little virtual circle or square reserved for their own beauteous faces, repeatedly, to put their formidable social media influence behind such a range of causes as I Am Charlie Hebdo, #MeToo, I Oppose CAB, Black Lives Matter, etc. By bunging in appropriate ready-made JPEGs downloaded from the internet on that all-powerful pedestal.

How are these valorous folks one bit inferior to the thali clangers, the diya lighters, the pumpkin-breakers, the chilli-and-lemon garlanders and the Go-Corona-Go chanters, tell me?

India is safe in their hands, my friends. Let’s you and I relax. Because, if an all-powerful neighbour were to attack us tomorrow, we can rest assured that my friends will annihilate them with their DPs.

2,2020/10/02,French Open | Halep trounces Anisimova,"Thiem and Svitolina also advance with ease to the pre-quarterfinals

Top seed Simona Halep extracted brutal revenge on American teenager Amanda Anisimova with a 6-0, 6-1 victory to move into the fourth round of the French Open on Friday.

Anisimova caused a huge upset last year when she comfortably beat the Romanian, then the defending champion, in the quarterfinals, but could not reproduce that form as she received a 54-minute claycourt lesson.

Miserly mood

Halep was in typically miserly mood on Court Philippe Chatrier, giving precious little away and waiting for the 19-year-old Anisimova to make mistakes.

She pocketed the opening set in 23 minutes and although 25th seed Anisimova, who had dropped only four games in her first two matches, briefly threatened a revival at the start of the second set Halep raced away to victory.

Halep will face another rising star in the next round when she plays Poland’s Iga Swiatek in a repeat of their fourth-round clash last year in which Halep dropped only one game.

Mertens crashes out

The event came alive as home hope Caroline Garcia battled back to beat 16th seed Elise Mertens 1-6, 6-4 7-5 in a third-round thriller

Earlier, Ukrainian third seed Elina Svitolina advanced with a no-nonsense 6-4, 7-5 victory against Russia’s Ekaterina Alexandrova.

In the men’s section, third seed Dominic Thiem was not at his best but still had enough firepower to see off the challenge from Norway’s Casper Ruud with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-1 win to march into the fourth round.

Later, American qualifier Sebastian Korda who beat Pedro Martinez 6-4, 6-3, 6-1, became the first qualifier to reach the second week in nine years and first man outside the top 200 to make the pre-quarterfinals here since local player Arnaud di Pasquale in 2002.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/xvl6i8/article32754539.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FRANCETENNISFRENCHOPEN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/french-open-halep-trounces-anisimova/article32754540.ece

4,2020/10/02,"Facebook, Twitter flounder in QAnon crackdown","On Wednesday, hours after a chaotic debate between Mr Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, a video from a QAnon account that falsely claimed Mr Biden wore a wire to cheat during the event was trending on Twitter

Facebook and Twitter promised to stop encouraging the growth of the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon, which fashions President Donald Trump as a secret warrior against a supposed child-trafficking ring run by celebrities and government officials, after it reached an audience of millions on their platforms this year.

But the social media companies still aren’t enforcing even the limited restrictions they’ve recently put in place to stem the tide of dangerous QAnon material, a review by The Associated Press found.

Both platforms have vowed to stop suggesting QAnon material to users, a powerful way of introducing QAnon to new people.

But neither has actually succeeded at that.

On Wednesday, hours after a chaotic debate between Mr Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, a video from a QAnon account that falsely claimed Mr Biden wore a wire to cheat during the event was trending on Twitter, for example.

Twitter is even still running ads against QAnon material, in effect profiting off the type of tweets that it has vowed to limit.

In some cases Facebook is still automatically directing users to follow public and secret QAnon pages or groups, the AP found.

Their algorithm worked to radicalise people and really gave this conspiracy theory a megaphone with which to expand, Sophie Bjork-James, an anthropologist at Vanderbilt University who studies QAnon, said of social platforms.

They are responsible for shutting down that megaphone. And time and time again they are proving unwilling.

The QAnon phenomenon sprawls across a patchwork of secret Facebook groups, Twitter accounts and YouTube videos.

QAnon has been linked to real-world violence such as criminal reports of kidnapping and dangerous claims that the coronavirus is a hoax.

But the conspiracy theory has also seeped into mainstream politics.

Several Republicans running for Congress this year are QAnon-friendly.

Although restricted to the backwaters of the internet for years, QAnon posts reached millions of people via social media this year.

Interactions -- primarily likes and comments -- with public Facebook and Instagram posts that included QAnon terms began climbing in March.

By July, they received more attention than at any other point in the last year, according to an AP analysis of data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned tool that helps track material on the platforms.

That month, public posts on Facebook-owned Instagram featuring the #QAnon hashtag received an average of 1.27 million likes and comments every week, according to the analysis.

Some of those posts included news stories about QAnon. But the majority of the most popular Instagram posts during July were expressing support for the conspiracy theory, President Donald Trump, or far-right conservative causes, the AP found.

One post that used the QAnon hashtag, which raked up nearly 20,000 likes, claimed that no one has died from coronavirus.

Another was a photo of Donald Trump that called him One of God’s Finest Warriors.

Twitter didn’t limit the conspiracy theory until July 21, when it announced it was kicking off 7,000 QAnon accounts and promised to stop promoting or recommending QAnon. Facebook introduced its new rules on August 18, pledging to stop encouraging users to join QAnon groups, banning QAnon hashtags and kicking off thousands of QAnon groups that encouraged violence.

Unfortunately, it was too late and not enough, Bjork-James said.

The AP also discovered more than a dozen popular QAnon accounts on Twitter that collectively maintain a following of nearly 1.5 million users, almost all of which were recommended to users who followed other QAnon accounts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/samle6/article31052021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13INDIA-SOCIALMEDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-twitter-flounder-in-qanon-crackdown/article32750602.ece

First lady Melania Trump too has tested positive; the White House physician says the President is expected to continue carrying out his duties “without disruption” while recovering.

In the eight months since India’s first case of coronavirus infection was detected on January 30, September alone recorded 26,21,418 infections, accounting for 41.53% of the total COVID-19 cases reported in the country so far.

Hathras gang rape | Those who even think of harming self respect of women will be totally destroyed: Yogi Adityanath

The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, in a tweet in Hindi, promised a punishment that will become an example in the future.

The recently passed Code on Social Security, the Industrial Relations Code and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, which along with the Code on Wages, 2019 subsume 29 labour laws into four codes, were passed after widespread consultations, says Santosh Kumar Gangwar.

The sweeping changes to allow postal ballots and increasing the voting time had been made through the Kerala Panchayat Raj (Second Amendment) Ordinance 2020 promulgated by the Governor, Arif Mohammed Khan based on the recommendations made by the Cabinet.

The case relates to subversive activities of the LeT in Kulgam. It was motivating youths such as Bhat to join the terror group and organised their travel to Pakistan for terrorist training on the basis of valid travel documents following the recommendation of separatist leaders, an NIA official said.

8,2020/10/02,"Maldives’s slow progress on rights a concern, say activists","They acknowledge some gains, especially in child rights

Two years after Maldivian President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih rose to power promising to “restore democracy”, his government’s record on fulfilling the poll-time pledge could be better, say activists.

Politically secure, the Solih administration -- which decisively won the September 2018 presidential polls and the April 2019 general elections – is faced with a grave economic crisis after its tourism-reliant economy broke down in the wake of the coronavirus. UNDP termed the pandemic’s impact on the Indian Ocean archipelago, with a five lakh-populatio, among the worst affected in Asia. Even as the government tries to cope with Covid-19 – over 10,000 cases and deaths so far -- and its grave economic impact, its promise to probe alleged human rights abuses committed during the former Abdulla Yameen administration has not been forgotten by those awaiting justice.

‘Better, but not good enough’

While acknowledging some significant gains since President Solih came to power, especially in child rights through the Juvenile Justice Act and Child Protection Act ratified by President Solih last year, activists voice concern over the government’s slow-paced efforts on other fronts.

“In comparison to the previous government, the civic space has opened up since 2018. However, this does not mean that there have not been issues pertaining to citizens’ democratic and fundamental rights, especially their right to Freedom of Expression,” says Deekshya Illangasinghe, Executive Director, South Asians for Human Rights (SAHR). Human rights defenders, who call for freedom of religion and belief, continue to receive death threats, verbal attacks, especially on social media, she notes, adding: “civil society are still not able to express their opinion without fear or repression.”

According to Mushfiq Mohamed, Secretary General of the Executive Committee of non-governmental organisation Maldivian Democracy Network’s (MDN), while the Solih administration has brought “commendable changes” to get the Maldives back on track with democracy, legal reforms to previously enacted anti-democratic laws have been slow over the past two years. “Recently, the government restricted protests based on anti-democratic amendments made by the previous government, which it was voted into repeal,” Mr. Mohamed told The Hindu.

Although the Whistleblower Protection Act – passed last year -- and the decriminalisation of defamation have sought to improve the environment for freedom of speech, journalists and human rights activists continue to operate in a ""dangerous climate"". “Many still resort to self-censorship on sensitive issues where police cannot be trusted to protect individuals,” says Mr. Mohamed.

The Maldives’s “harsh treatment” of migrant workers since COVID-19 struck has also drawn attention recently, including from international rights watchdogs. The migrant workers had to undergo various hardships, Ms. Illangasinghe observes, adding: “Some were even treated as criminals for protesting to obtain their due payments. Large numbers were arrested and consequently deported without even giving proper access to lawyers.”

Pending cases

Meanwhile, the government’s slow progress on two crucial cases has come under scrutiny. In their campaigns ahead of both the presidential and parliamentary elections, the ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP)’s Leader and Speaker Mohamed Nasheed and President Solih made bold pledges to probe the disappearance of journalist Ahmed Rilwan, who was known for his critical views and is missing since August 2014, and the killing of dissident blogger Yameen Rasheed in 2017. “It is disappointing to note that, even though the current government came into power with a promise to investigate these cases, the progress has been very slow where the perpetrators have still not been brought to justice and the families remain in hope,” Ms. Illangasinghe says.

When President Solih convened the Commission on Investigation of Murders and Enforced Disappearances on his first day in office, 17 November 2018, he gave the victims’ families and rights groups reason for hope. In September last year, the panel said the investigation, then “nearing completion”, threw up troubling evidence of radical Islamist groups targeting dissidents like journalist Rilwan, who they believed, was murdered on a vessel at sea. The murder of blogger Rasheed too, was linked to the case. There has been no substantial forward movement since. In July this year, the families of Rilwan and Rasheed requested President Solih to invite an international expert to assist the investigations undertaken by the Commission, hoping that would expedite the probe.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qaiv3h/article32754607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-SOLIH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/maldivess-slow-progress-on-rights-a-concern-say-activists/article32754608.ece

Dozens of democracy supporters were arrested in Hong Kong on Thursday for defying a protest ban as the city marked China’s National Day and its leader hailed Beijing’s new security law for restoring stability to the restive finance hub.

The People’s Republic of China celebrates its founding on October 1 with a holiday and carefully choreographed festivities.

But in Hong Kong, it has become a day of grievance for those worried about authoritarian Beijing’s intensifying crackdown against its opponents.

Protest has been effectively outlawed for most of this year due to coronavirus restrictions on gatherings and Beijing also imposed a strict national security law on the city in June.

Police said at least 60 were detained during protests, mostly for “unlawful assembly”. Officers also raised banners warning crowds that they were breaching the national security law with their protest chants.

Last year’s National Day, the PRC’s 70th anniversary, brought fierce clashes between protesters and police during seven months of democracy demonstrations that upended Hong Kong.

10,2020/10/02,Armenia says it is ready for mediation,"Azerbaijan says talks only if fighting stops; main Karabakh city faces heavy firing

Armenia accused Azerbaijani forces of striking the main city in the disputed Nagorny Karabakh region on Friday as fighting raged for a sixth day.

International calls for the two neighbours to halt fire and begin talks are intensifying as fears grow that the clashes could expand into a multi-front war sucking in regional powers Turkey and Russia.

French President Emmanuel Macron has warned NATO member Turkey — which backs Azerbaijan — against the alleged deployment of militants from Syria to the Karabakh conflict.

On Thursday, leaders of Russia, France and the United States — co-chairs of the so-called Minsk Group, which was set up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 1992 to resolve the conflict — issued a joint statement statement calling for immediate cessation of hostilities and resuming substantive negotiations ... under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs.

The Hindu Explains | What’s behind the Armenia-Azerbaijan clashes?

Armenia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday that the country stands ready to engage with the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group to reestablish a cease-fire regime based on the 1994-1995 agreements.

Armenia remains committed to the peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, the statement read.

The deadly clashes in the region resumed Friday, with Armenian military officials reporting Azerbaijan carrying out strikes on Nagorno-Karabakh’s capital Stepanakert, and Azerbaijan’s Defense Ministry accusing Armenian forces of shelling the Agdam region.

Yerevan on Friday expressed its readiness to work with international mediators to bring a halt to the fighting.

Armenia “stands ready to engage” with France, Russia, and the U.S. — which co-chair the OSCE group of mediators — “to re-establish a ceasefire regime,” the foreign ministry in Yerevan said.

But it said that talks could not begin unless fighting is halted.

Baku and Yerevan have for decades been locked in a simmering conflict over the ethnic Armenian province that broke away from Azerbaijan in a bitterly fought war in the 1990s.

11,2020/10/02,"Emmanuel Macron says Islam ‘in crisis’, unveils anti-radicalism plan","Emmanuel Macron insisted “no concessions” would be made in a new drive to push religion out of education and the public sector in France.

President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a plan Friday to defend France's secular values against radical Islam, announcing stricter oversight of schooling and better control over foreign funding of mosques.

Describing Islam as a religion “in crisis” worldwide, Mr. Macron insisted that “no concessions” would be made in a new drive to eradicate extremist religious teaching in schools and mosques.

At the same time, Mr. Macron said France must do more to offer economic and social mobility to immigrant communities, adding radicals had often filled the vacuum.

His long-awaited address came 18 months before presidential elections where Macron is set to face a challenge from the right, as public concern grows over security in France.

“Islam is a religion that is in crisis all over the world today, we are not just seeing this in our country,” Mr. Macron said in Les Mureaux, a town outside Paris with a historically large immigrant population.

He said extremists were seeking to indoctrinate new converts across the country, which has one of the largest Muslim populations in Europe.

He denounced a trend of “Islamist separatism” that flouts French rules and seeks to create a ""counter-society"" holding its own laws above all others.

This form of sectarianism often translates into children being kept out of school, and the use of sporting, cultural and other community activities as a ""pretext to teach principles that do not conform to the laws of the republic,"" Macron said.

He said the government would present a bill in December that would strengthen the country's bedrock 1905 law that officially separated church and state.

'Liberate' French Islam

Among the new law's provisions, there will be closer scrutiny of the curriculum at private schools and stricter limits on home-schooling for reasons other than a child's health problems.

Community associations that receive state subsidies will have to sign a contract avowing their commitment to secularism and the values of France.

There will be closer scrutiny of such organisations, and the law will make it easier to shutter those breaking anti-indoctrination rules.

The new measures will also include a ban on the wearing of religious symbols for employees of subcontractors providing public services, such as transport operators.

The rule already applies to public servants.

Mr. Macron said there had been increased reports of abuses by sub-contracting staff, including bus drivers refusing women entry for wearing clothing considered too revealing.

He emphasised that it was necessary to ""liberate Islam in France from foreign influences,"" naming countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey.

To this end, the government will step up checks on foreign financing of mosques and clamp down on letting imams go abroad for training, or on hosting foreign preachers on French soil.

'Ghettoisation'

Mr. Macron stressed that the measures did not seek to stigmatise or alienate France's Muslims but to bolster “our ability to live together.”

He urged better understanding of Islam and said the problem of radicalisation was partly a product of the ""ghettoisation"" of French cities and towns where “we constructed our own separatism.”

“We have concentrated populations based on their origins, we have not sufficiently created diversity, or ensured economic and social mobility” in segregated areas, he said.

Radical Islamists have swooped in, taking advantage of “our withdrawal, our cowardice,” he added.

France has in recent years been forced to take a hard look at its core republican values, perceived by many to be threatened by Islam in the wake of several terror attacks since 2015 targeting secular liberties such as freedom of expression.

Mr. Macron was speaking one week after a man wounded two people with a meat cleaver outside the former Paris offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly, which the government denounced as ""Islamist terrorism.""

Staff at Charlie Hebdo were massacred in January 2015 by Islamist gunmen seeking to avenge its publication of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed.

In January, a renewed debate about freedom of expression erupted when a teenager received death threats for attacking Islam in an expletive-laden Instagram rant.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to speak to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday to take stock of negotiations on a post-Brexit free trade deal and to discuss next steps, a British government spokesman said.

The U.K. announcement came as both sides were winding up another weeklong session of detailed negotiations on a rudimentary free trade agreement that should come in force once a Brexit transition period ends December 31.

Little progress has been made on such a deal sine the U.K. left the bloc at the end of January.

13,2020/10/02,Bernie Sanders to resume in-person campaigning to back Biden,"Spokesman Mike Casca says the Vermont senator will hold a socially distanced, outdoor rally on Saturday in Lebanon, New Hampshire which will be capped to keep crowds from growing too large

Bernie Sanders is returning to in-person campaigning for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March, heading to the battleground states of New Hampshire and Michigan to promote Joe Biden and sooth any lingering tensions between the Democratic Party’s progressive and centrist wings.

Spokesman Mike Casca says the Vermont senator will hold a socially distanced, outdoor rally Saturday in Lebanon, New Hampshire which will be capped to keep crowds from growing too large. On Monday, Mr. Sanders will host a drive-in rally in Macomb County, Michigan — a Detroit suburb that voted Republican in 2016 and was instrumental in clinching the White House for President Donald Trump.

Also read | Take Trump seriously when he doesn’t commit to orderly transfer of power: Sanders

Mr. Sanders ended his presidential primary campaign in April and endorsed Biden just days later, as both candidates worked to promote party unity that largely eluded Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Some of Mr. Sanders’ top advisers and supporters later formed joint task forces with their counterparts from Biden’s camp to hammer out agreements on major policy issues that were reflected in the Democratic Party platform. Also, high ranking Sanders campaign leaders have formed two Super PACs to promote Biden — despite Sanders personally opposing outside money in politics.

Mr. Sanders hitting the road again comes as Mr. Trump has increasingly sought to paint Biden as beholden to progressive activists and the radical left. Mr. Biden, who won the primary largely as a moderate, says he wants to build a broad coalition of support from all Democrats and as many Republicans as possible — but has noted that he doesn’t support some of Mr. Sanders’ most progressive ideas. That includes not embracing fully government-funded health care under a Medicare for All plan, nor a sweeping package of climate change-fighting measures known as the Green New Deal.

Mr. Biden has said he beat the socialist referring to Mr. Sanders. Amid sharp criticism from Mr. Trump about embracing some of Mr. Sanders’ policies during the first presidential debate in Cleveland on Tuesday, the former vice president noted, “Right now, I’m the Democratic Party”. Mr. Sanders reiterated on ABC’s The View this week that Mr. Biden doesn’t share his support for Medicare for All. “He does not agree with me, though I wish he did,” Mr. Sanders said.

Even before his scheduled trips, Mr. Sanders spent months staging virtual town halls and other events around the country on Mr. Biden’s behalf. Since the Democratic convention in August, he’s held more than a dozen online rallies, targeting voters in Kentucky, West Virginia, Iowa, Wisconsin, Colorado, Texas, Vermont, Pennsylvania and Michigan, as well as virtual events focused on Latino and rural voters.

All told, Mr. Casca said, those events attracted 5 million views of clips and livestreams.

Mr. Sanders also endorsed 76 candidates for elected office around the country this cycle and saw three-fourths of those win. Sanders argues that Trump poses an existential threat to American democracy, warning that the president may use election results that could be delayed by high volumes of mail-in ballots cast amid the pandemic to declare victory illegitimately.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2i7win/article31378514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19-US-BIDENANDSANDERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bernie-sanders-to-resume-in-person-campaigning-to-back-biden/article32752273.ece

15,2020/10/02,"Condemn all white supremacist, says Donald Trump","The U.S. President had been criticised for refusing to condemn white supremacy during the first presidential debate with Joe Biden.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday condemned all kinds of white supremacists something which he was hesitant to do during the first presidential debate with his Democratic rival Joe Biden early this week.

“I’ve said it many times, and let me be clear again: I condemn the [Ku Klux Klan]. I condemn all white supremacists. I condemn the Proud Boys. I don’t know much about the Proud Boys, almost nothing. But I condemn that,” Mr. Trump told Fox News on Thursday night.

The Ku Klux Klan, commonly called the KKK or the Klan, is an infamous white supremacist hate group in America.

Mr. Trump said he could say it a hundred times but it would not be enough for the “fake media.”

The President has been facing a lot of criticism for not directly condemning white supremacists during the debate.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden clashed over the issue of race in America in the first presidential debate wherein the Republican leader hesitated to condemn white supremacists.

During the debate in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday, moderator Chris Wallace asked Mr. Trump, “Are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say that they need to stand down?”

“I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing, not the right wing,” Mr. Trump replied. “I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.”

When pressed further, he said, “Give me a name”, to which Mr. Biden chimed in, “Proud Boys”, referring to a far-right outfit that has been designated as a hate group by the nonprofit legal advocacy organisation, Southern Poverty Law Centre.

“Proud Boys — Stand back, stand by,” Mr. Trump responded and then moved attention to the left-wing anti-fascist movement known as Antifa.

“Somebody has got to do something about Antifa and the left because this isn’t a right-wing problem, this is a left-wing problem,” he said.

Mr. Biden alleged that Mr. Trump has used everything as a “dog whistle” to try to generate racist hatred and division.

During the Fox News interview, Mr. Trump appeared to be equating white supremacist groups and left-wing demonstrators who loosely identify with Antifa.

Mr. Biden, he demanded, should condemn Antifa, which he described as “a horrible group of people.”

Early in the day, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that Mr. Trump has always denounced white supremacists.

“That has been answered yesterday by the President himself, the day before by the President himself on the debate stage; the President was asked this he said sure three times. Yesterday he was point-blank asked, do you denounce white supremacy and he said I have always denounced any form of that,” Ms. McEnany told reporters at a White House news conference.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a15l5l/article32710961.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THAPTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/condemn-all-white-supremacist-says-donald-trump/article32750985.ece
16,2020/10/02,Pak Hindu girl ends life after being blackmailed by rapists out on bail,"“There was this incident of the death of 11 migrant Pakistani Hindus which was reported to us on August 8.”

A 17-year-old Hindu girl died by suicide in Pakistan’s Sindh province after she was reportedly blackmailed by three men accused of sexually assaulting her, a media report said on Thursday.

The girl ended her life by jumping into a deep well in village Dalan-Jo-Tarr in Tharparkar district on Wednesday, Dawn reported.

Her body was retrieved by the villagers who rushed her to a nearby hospital where she was declared brought dead.

“The girl was raped by three men in mid-July in 2019 and the accused in the case are on bail,” the victim’s father and other relatives told reporters.

They alleged that the girl committed suicide after she was blackmailed and harassed by the influential suspects who had raped her, according to the paper.

According to an FIR registered in 2019, the three men forcibly took the girl to a house where they raped her and filmed the ordeal.

The trial in the case was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The trial of the case was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. October 15 has now been fixed as the date when evidence in the case will be submitted, said Mohan Mathrani, the lawyer of the victim’s family.

No fresh case was immediately registered against the accused after the girl’s death. However, one of the three suspects was arrested by the police.

Chelhar Station House Office Mushtaq Malik said that the police would register a fresh case if the family lodges a complaint of blackmail or harassment.

Several people including rights activists have demanded a stern action against those responsible for the crime. People of the Meghwar community and workers of various parties have warned to stage protests in Thar and other areas against the rising incidents of crimes against women.

Prime Minister Imran Khan recently said that rapists should be handed down the most severe punishments to curb the rising sexual violence, such as either hanging them publicly or chemically castrating them.

Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.

According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan, mostly in Sindh province.

17,2020/10/02,U.S. judge blocks Trump’s H-1B visa ban,"In June, Mr. Trump had issued an executive order that had put temporary bar on issuing of new H-1B, H-2B, J and L visas.

In a major relief to thousands of Indian IT professionals, a federal judge in the U.S. on Thursday blocked the enforcement of a temporary visa ban by the Trump administration on a large number of work permits, including the most sought after H-1B visas, ruling that the President exceeded his constitutional authority.

The order issued by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White of Northern District of California applies to members of organisations that filed a lawsuit against the Department of Commerce and Department of Homeland Security — the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, National Retail Federation, TechNet, a technology industry group, and Intrax Inc., which sponsors cultural exchanges.

The ruling places an immediate hold on a series of damaging visa restrictions that prevent manufacturers from filling crucial, hard-to-fill jobs to support economic recovery, growth and innovation when most needed, the National Association of manufacturers said.

In June, Mr. Trump had issued an executive order that had put temporary bar on issuing of new H-1B visas, which are widely used by major American and Indian technology companies, H-2B visas for nonagricultural seasonal workers, J visas for cultural exchanges and L visas for managers and other key employees of multinational corporations till the end of the year.

The President had argued that the U.S. needs to save and protect jobs for its domestic work force at a time when millions of them lost their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Companies protest

A number of IT companies and other U.S. companies and those representing them had voiced their opposition to it.

Manufacturers went to court to challenge the administration’s ban on certain visas because the restrictions both undermined the industry at a critical time and conflicted with the law, said NAM senior vice president and general counsel Linda Kelly.

We are competing with the rest of the world to find and develop top talent to support innovation in our industry. Today’s decision is a temporary win for manufacturers committed to building that innovation in the United States, he said.

A long-term win for manufacturers requires policymakers to support meaningful reforms to our immigration laws that recognise the critical link between smart immigration policy and America’s competitive advantage, Ms. Kelly said.

In his order, the federal judge said that the President exceeded his authority.

Congress’s delegation of authority in the immigration context does not afford the President unbridled authority to set domestic policy regarding employment of nonimmigrant foreigners. Such a finding would render the President’s Article II powers all but superfluous, Judge White wrote in his 25-page order.

The judge noted that the text of Article I and more than two centuries of legislative practice and judicial precedent make clear, the Constitution vests Congress, not the President, with the power to set immigration policy.

If the fact that immigrants come from other countries inherently made their admission foreign relations subject to the President’s Article II power, then all of this law would be superfluous, the judge said.

Indeed, there must be some measure of constraint on Presidential authority in the domestic sphere in order not to render the executive an entirely monarchical power in the immigration context, an area within clear legislative prerogative. Such unrestricted authority would be contrary to Congress’ explicit delegation of powers in foreign affairs and national security, Mr. White said.

The ruling by Judge White is in difference with a order passed by District Judge Amit Mehta of the District of Columbia in August, who ruled that he does not has the power to enjoin the ban while the litigation is under way.

The wisdom of the President’s decision to address those changed circumstances by restricting the entry of certain classes of aliens is a policy decision the judiciary is not well equipped to evaluate, he said.

The H-1B visa, most sought-after among Indian IT professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/piytsr/article24171457.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15INTHROHUSVISA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-judge-blocks-trumps-h-1b-visa-ban/article32750279.ece
18,2020/10/02,U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady test positive for COVID-19,"The White House physician says the President is expected to continue carrying out his duties “without disruption” while recovering.

With just over a month to go for the Presidential election, U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump announced that they had tested positive for the coronavirus. The news will mean a dramatic reduction in the in-person rallies Mr. Trump can hold in October and has cast doubt on whether the President will be able to participate in the next presidential debate scheduled for October 15.

Announcing his condition, Mr. Trump tweeted: “Tonight, FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!”

The White House sent out a memorandum from Mr. Trump’s physician Sean Conley, after Mr. Trump’s announcement, confirming the infections and saying the Trumps will remain at home during their convalescence.

“Rest assured I expect the President to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering,” Mr. Conley said.

Vice-President Mike Pence and Second Lady Karen Pence tested negative on Friday morning as per a tweet from Mr. Pence’s office.

Hours before Mr. Trump made the announcement, Bloomberg News reported that his adviser Hope Hicks had tested positive. Ms. Hicks had travelled with the President this week, including to Ohio for the first debate against Democratic nominee Joe Biden.

In addition to appearing on stage with Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump had a full schedule this week, including a flight to his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey, for a fundraiser. He did not wear a mask at the golf course or on the plane, the Washington Post reported. Mr. Trump announced that he and Ms. Trump had begun their “quarantine process” as news of Ms. Hick’s infection broke and the Trumps awaited their test results.

Mr. Biden said he and his wife, Jill, wished the Trumps a “swift recovery”.

“Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the President and his family,” Mr. Biden tweeted.

Mr. Biden’s last tweet before the news of the President’s health situation broke was about Mr. Trump distracting the country from his “failed COVID-19 response”.

Mr. Trump was supposed to hold a roundtable with supporters in Washington on Friday and later fly to Sanford, Florida, for a rally. Instead, his Friday calendar was updated to show just a previously scheduled phone call “on COVID-19 support to vulnerable seniors”.

First Lady Melania Trump also tweeted about the situation, saying “too many” Americans had tested positive and were quarantining.

“As too many Americans have done this year, POTUS & I are quarantining at home after testing positive for COVID-19. We are feeling good & I have postponed all upcoming engagements. Please be sure you are staying safe & we will all get through this together,” Ms. Trump said.

Some 208,000 Americans have died and 7.3 million Americans have been infected since the virus hit the U.S. Had social distancing guidelines been instituted a week earlier in March, the U.S. could have seen 36,000 fewer deaths and 700,000 fewer infections by May, as per a Columbia University study.

The President has been criticised for not taking the virus seriously. He told veteran investigative journalist Bob Woodward that he wanted to play down the virus so as not to create panic. In February, he said the virus would disappear “like a miracle”. His campaign rallies have been characterised by a lack of masks and little social distancing.

The President’s estranged niece Mary Trump , who recently wrote a scathingly critical book on Mr Trump, implied that her sympathies were not with her uncle but with those who were sick or had died or had been misled .

""I reserve my sympathy, empathy, and despair for those who are sick and for those who have died because they were misled, lied to, or ignored. Wear a f****** mask,"" she wrote on Twitter.

Modi wishes Trumps

President Ramnath Kovind wished the Trumps a “speedy recovery” on Twitter. “Our prayers and best wishes are with you during this time,” he wrote.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi also wished the couple. “Wishing my friend @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS a quick recovery and good health,” he wrote on Twitter.

Mr. Trump is not the only major world leader known to have contracted the virus. Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro too contracted the virus in July. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent a week in the hospital, including three nights in intensive care, where he was given oxygen and watched around the clock by medical workers. German Chancellor Angela Merkel self-isolated after a doctor who gave her a vaccination tested positive for the virus, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau worked from home after his wife fell ill.

19,2020/10/02,"Pentagon okays $90 million sale of spares, support for C-130J Super Hercules aircraft to India","This sale of spares and services will enable the Indian Air Force to sustain a higher mission-ready status fleet, according to a notification.

The Pentagon has approved India’s request to buy $90 million worth of equipment, spare parts and logistical support for its fleet of C-130J Super Hercules cargo aircraft.

In its notification to the Congress, the Defence Security Cooperation Agency said the proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the U.S. by helping to strengthen the U.S.-India strategic relationship and improve the security of a major defence partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia region.

The items ordered by India are aircraft consumable spares and repair/return parts; ground support and equipment; Cartridge Actuated Devices/Propellant Actuated Devices (CAD/PAD) fire extinguisher cartridges; flare cartridges; BBU-35/B cartridge impulse squibs.

India has also ordered for one spare AN/ALR-56M Advanced Radar Warning Receiver shipset; spare AN/ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispenser System shipset; ten Lightweight Night Vision Binocular (F5032); ten AN/AVS-9 Night Vision Goggle (NVG)(F4949); GPS and Electronic Warfare.

It is also seeking instruments and lab equipment support; joint mission planning system; cryptographic device spares and loaders; software and software support; publications and technical documentation; personnel training and training and training equipment; contractor engineering, technical and logistical support, and other related elements of programme support.

According to the notification, the proposed sale ensures that the previously procured aircraft operates effectively to serve the needs of the Indian Air Force, Army and Navy transport requirements, local and international humanitarian assistance and regional disaster relief.

This sale of spares and services will enable the Indian Air Force to sustain a higher mission-ready status fleet, it said.

India will have no difficulty absorbing this additional sustainment support, it said, adding that the proposed sale of this equipment and support worth $90 million will not alter the basic military balance in the region.

Notification of such major sales is mandatory under the Arms Export Control Act. Lawmakers have 30 days to review the proposed sale. The sale would be executed by defence major Lockheed-Martin.

India is one of the 17 countries to whom the U.S. has sold its C-130J Super Hercules aircraft. The Indian Air Force currently operates a fleet of five C-130J-30s. India has placed order for additional six C-130J-30s Super Hercules aircraft.

From the highest landing strip in the world to austere runways almost destroyed by natural disasters, the C-130J goes where other airlifters can’t, won’t or don’t go. It’s a workhorse that’s in operation around the world, flying in every environment and mission scenario required every day and everywhere, Lockheed says on its website.

In the summer of 2013, Indian Air Force performed the highest landing of a C-130J at the Daulat Beg Oldi airstrip in Ladakh at the height of 16,614 ft. The aircraft was used extensively by the U.S. in Afghanistan and Iraq.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/um8j4l/article32750089.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/REPUBLICDAY2020THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pentagon-okays-90-million-sale-of-spares-support-for-c-130j-super-hercules-aircraft-to-india/article32750090.ece
20,2020/10/02,Trump in 'quarantine process' after top aide gets COVID-19,"Hope Hicks, one the U.S. President's closest aides, had tested positive for the virus on Thursday.

President Donald Trump said he and first lady Melania Trump are beginning a “quarantine process” after a top aide he spent substantial time with this week tested positive for COVID-19.

Mr. Trump’s comments came after he confirmed that Hope Hicks, one his closest aides, had tested positive for the virus on Thursday. Ms. Hicks began feeling mild symptoms during the plane ride home from a rally in Minnesota on Wednesday evening, according to an administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose private information. She was quarantined away from others on the plane and her diagnosis was confirmed Thursday, the person said.

Mr. Trump tweeted late Thursday: “The First Lady and I are waiting for our test results. In the meantime, we will begin our quarantine process.”

Both of them have also tested positive later in the day.

Earlier, during a call-in interview with Fox News Channel’s Sean Hannity, Mr. Trump said: “Whether we quarantine or whether we have it, I don’t know. I just went for a test and we’ll see what happens.”

It can take days for an infection to be detectable by a test, and it was unclear what Mr. Trump’s quarantine entailed. Minutes before his tweet, the White House distributed a schedule for Friday that showed he planned to go forward with a fundraiser at his Washington, D.C., hotel and a political rally in Sanford, Florida.

Virus still strong

The positive test is yet another reminder that the coronavirus continues to spread, even as Mr. Trump has tried desperately to suggest it no longer poses a danger. Since it emerged earlier this year, Mr. Trump, the White House and his campaign have played down the threat and refused to abide by basic public health guidelines — including those issued by his own administration — such as wearing masks in public and practicing social distancing. Instead, Mr. Trump has continued to hold campaign rallies that draw thousands of supporters. The virus has killed more than 200,000 Americans and infected more than 7 million nationwide.

The White House had not responded earlier to multiple questions about the last time Mr. Trump was tested and whether he and other staffers who spent time with Ms. Hicks in recent days will be asked to quarantine.

Mr. Trump traveled to New Jersey on Thursday for a fundraiser despite concerns about Ms. Hicks’ health.

Mr. Trump is 74 years old, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from the virus. He said he expected to have the results back either on Thursday night or Friday morning.

White House statement

In a statement, White House spokesperson Judd Deere said the President “takes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously.”

“White House Operations collaborates with the Physician to the President and the White House Military Office to ensure all plans and procedures incorporate current CDC guidance and best practices for limiting COVID-19 exposure to the greatest extent possible both on complex and when the President is traveling,” Mr. Deere said.

Multiple White House staffers have tested positive for the virus, including Katie Miller, Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary, national security adviser Robert O’Brien, and one of the president’s personal valets. Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is dating Mr. Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., tested positive in South Dakota before an Independence Day fireworks show at Mount Rushmore.

Still, Mr. Trump has consistently played down concerns about being personally vulnerable to contracting COVID-19. “I felt no vulnerability whatsoever,” he told reporters back in May.

After earlier positive cases close to the President, the White House instituted a daily testing regimen for the President’s senior aides. Anyone who will be in close proximity to the President or Vice President is also tested every day, including reporters.

While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 quarantine for 14 days, White House staffers are considered essential workers. CDC’s guidelines for exposed essential workers allows them to return to work if they take precautions, including taking their temperature before going into work, wearing a mask at all times and practicing social distancing.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/f51kds/article32749827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-TRUMPTHNAKz,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-in-quarantine-process-after-top-aide-gets-covid-19/article32749809.ece
21,2020/10/02,U.S. Senate panel moves to compel three social media CEOs to testify,"The executives’ testimony is needed “to reveal the extent of influence that their companies have over American speech during a critical time in our democratic process.” a Republican Senator said.

A Senate panel voted on Thursday to compel testimony from the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter as lawmakers opened a new front in the battle over hate speech, misinformation and perceived political bias on social media a month before the presidential election.

The Senate Commerce Committee authorised subpoenas for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai of Google and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey to force them to appear at a planned hearing if they do not agree to do so voluntarily.

The executives’ testimony is needed “to reveal the extent of influence that their companies have over American speech during a critical time in our democratic process,” said Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican who heads the committee.

The committee’s unanimous vote marked the start of a new bipartisan initiative against Big Tech companies, which have been under increasing scrutiny in Washington and from State attorneys general over issues of competition, consumer privacy and hate speech.

Facebook, meanwhile, is expanding restrictions on political advertising, including new bans on messages claiming widespread voter fraud. The new prohibitions laid out in a blog post come days after President Donald Trump raised the prospect of mass fraud in the vote-by-mail process during a debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden.

A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on the committee’s action. Representatives of Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

With Mr. Trump leading the way, conservative Republicans have kept up a barrage of criticism of Silicon Valley’s social media platforms, which they accuse without evidence of deliberately suppressing conservative views.

The Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms, putting down a legislative marker in Mr. Trump’s drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that has served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.

At a White House event last week, officials said the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Attorney General William Barr said the administration will also seek legislation to let individuals pursue legal claims against online platforms for “bad-faith censorship.”

Democrats, on the other hand, have focused their criticism of social media mainly on hate speech, misinformation and other content that can incite violence or keep people from voting. They have criticized Big Tech CEOs for failing to police content, homing in on the platforms’ role in hate crimes and the rise of white nationalism in the U.S.

In 2017, following the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, tech giants began banning extremist groups and individuals espousing white supremacist views and support for violence. Facebook extended the ban to white nationalists.

The three CEOs are being summoned to testify as the Justice Department moves toward antitrust action against Google with a focus on the company’s dominance in online search and whether it was used to stifle competition and hurt consumers.

A bipartisan coalition of 50 U.S. states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, also has been investigating Google’s business practices. They have cited “potential monopolistic behavior.”

Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell ads.

Facebook, Amazon and Apple have also been targets of sweeping antitrust investigations by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.

In the House, a judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan investigation of Big Tech’s market dominance. Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Pichai as well as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Apple CEO Tim Cook testified at a highly charged hearing by the panel in July.

The subcommittee, which is expected to issue a report on its findings soon, held a hearing on Thursday at which experts discussed proposals to strengthen the antitrust laws and promote competition among Big Tech companies.

Speaking of the July hearing with the four CEOs, panel chairman Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., said, “We pressed them for answers about their business practices, including about the evidence we uncovered that they have exploited, entrenched and expanded their power in anti-competitive and abusive ways.”

""To put it simply, their answers were evasive,” Mr. Cicilline said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wprhsl/article32748628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THSENATEPANEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-senate-panel-moves-to-compel-three-social-media-ceos-to-testify/article32748629.ece
22,2020/10/02,"Fight against COVID-19 clearest example of U.S.-India partnership, says U.S. official","Collaborative approach on therapeutics will have a positive global impact of the collaboration, the official said.

India and the U.S. are equipped to address a range of challenges for the benefit of the world and the clearest example of this can be seen in the partnership between the two countries to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, a senior State Department official has said.

India has been an important partner for the U.S. since the early days of the pandemic when countries were desperate for factual information about the virus and searching for personal protective equipment and other medical supplies, a senior State Department official told reporters during a conference in Washington.

Together, the United States and India are equipped to address a range of challenges for the benefit of our countries, the Indo-Pacific region, and the world. Perhaps the clearest example of how the U.S.-India partnership has benefited the world is in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the official said.

At that time, Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun engaged with India to come up with solutions to these problems.

Our collaborative approach on therapeutics is an excellent example of the positive global impact of the U.S.-India partnership, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

American company Gilead has granted voluntary non-exclusive licensing agreements to Indian pharmaceutical companies to produce a generic form of remdesivir.

As a result, this effective COVID-19 therapeutic will be made available at scale and at speed to 127 low and middle-income countries, the official said.

The U.S. and India are also working together to develop and produce vaccines to address the COVID-19 pandemic, the official said.

Looking forward to the next six months and beyond, we know that our continued close cooperation with India will be an important part of the global recovery from the pandemic, the official added.

Asserting that both the U.S. and India are stronger, safer, and more prosperous when they work together, the official welcomed India’s upcoming term in the UN Security Council.

We look forward to working together in that forum to address global challenges, the official said.

The U.S. and India have also joined forces through the G20 to support the Debt Service Suspension Initiative. The two countries are working together through this initiative to offer debt relief to help the world’s poorest countries recover from the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic and to promote best practices in debt transparency and sustainability, in contrast to ongoing Chinese efforts to hide its unsustainable debt diplomacy, the official said.

It’s not just COVID-19 that is a shared challenge for the world. The U.S., India, and countries all over the world are becoming increasingly aware of the negative effects of disinformation and other destabilising actions in the Indo-Pacific region and the world.

In this context, India’s role on the world stage and India’s work with the United States and other partners has become even more important. India’s important to the effort to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region because we view India as an emerging global power that shares our vision of an Indo-Pacific region that is peaceful, stable, and prosperous for all, the senior State Department official said.

In pursuit of that goal, we look to cooperate on developing and promoting trusted digital networks, developing global debt solutions that are fair and sustainable, and by developing reliable and trusted supply chains to ensure that countries are not vulnerable to economic coercion, said the official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/w76uei/article30291341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001J10ZD-13dec,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fight-against-covid-19-clearest-example-of-us-india-partnership-says-us-official/article32748618.ece
23,2020/10/02,"After Pompeo criticism, Vatican asserts right to go its own way on China","Mr. Pompeo accused the Vatican of putting its “moral authority” at risk if it renewed an agreement with China over the appointment of bishops.

The Vatican's number two said on Thursday after talks with Mike Pompeo that the two sides' positions on China remained far apart and firmly asserted the Holy See's right to pursue an accord with Beijing denounced by the U.S. Secretary of State.

Mr. Pompeo met Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Foreign Minister Archbishop Paul Gallagher on Thursday on a visit to Rome marked by Vatican irritation over Mr. Pompeo's public criticism of a Holy See accord with Beijing on the appointment of bishops.

Vatican officials have said they were “surprised” by Mr. Pompeo's comments, made last month, and particularly that they were published in a conservative U.S. Catholic publication that has called Pope Francis' pontificate a failure.

Mr. Parolin, second only to the pope in the Vatican hierarchy, spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a book launch on Thursday night. He was asked if the positions were still distant.

“Yes, even though the purpose of the meeting was not to bring the positions closer,” he said.

In an article and a series of tweets in September, Mr. Pompeo accused the Vatican of putting its “moral authority” at risk if it renewed an agreement with China over the appointment of bishops. It sparked a minor diplomatic crisis.

Vatican officials suggested Mr. Pompeo was trying to drag the Catholic Church into the U.S. presidential election by denouncing its relations with China. Mr. Pompeo has denied this.

“He (Pompeo) explained his reasons for making those statements and we explained our reasons why we intend to move ahead on the path we have already chosen,” Mr. Parolin said.

Mr. Parolin said the Vatican “asserts (the right to move forward) with a choice that has been thought through, reflected on, prayed over, a choice the Pope has made, therefore the freedom to move forward.”

The Vatican's two-year-old accord with Beijing gives the Pope final say over the appointment of Chinese bishops. Mr. Parolin said the Vatican would renew it when it expires this month.

Vatican officials say the agreement is not perfect but establishes a dialogue with Beijing after decades during which Chinese Catholics faithful to the Pope were driven underground.

Mr. Parolin said Mr. Pompeo had expressed “understanding for the way the Holy See approaches these issues.”

President Donald Trump has campaigned on his hard line on China ahead of the November 3 election. He is also associated with conservative Protestant and Catholic movements, many of which have been critical of Pope Francis.

In an address to a symposium on Wednesday, Mr. Pompeo did not directly address the Vatican agreement with Beijing but described China as the world's worst abuser of religious rights.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iotaig/article32748599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THREUTERSVATICANANDUSA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/after-pompeo-criticism-vatican-asserts-right-to-go-its-own-way-on-china/article32748600.ece
24,2020/10/02,"Choose wisely, Sonia Gandhi tells the voters of Bihar","People should choose wisely, she says as Congress formally launches Bihar poll campaign

Some people were running the government by trading in emotions, confusion and fear and people should choose wisely, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday told a rally in Bihar via videoconferencing, as the party formally launched its Assembly poll campaign in the State by recalling Mahatma Gandhi’s Champaran movement on his 151st birth anniversary.

“Brothers and sisters, enough is enough now. I just want to say that some people are running the government by trading in emotions, confusion and fear. You should be most careful and make the right decision. For this, we all have to fight unitedly, walking on the path of truth, non-violence and swaraj of Gandhi ji,” she told the rally in Motihari.

Tie-up with RJD

Her comments came on a day when the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) moved a step closer to finalising a seat-sharing pact in which the Congress may get 70 seats, Left parties 29 and Mukesh Saini’s Vikasheel Insaan Party 11.

The RJD would contest in the remaining 133 seats, said a source.

A senior leader, however, told The Hindu that the two parties would be able to make a formal announcement only once seats were identified for each party. Of the 70 offered to the Congress, at least, 13 were seats where the party had never won in the past five decades.

‘Laws diluted’

Irrespective of the status of alliance, Ms. Gandhi mounted a scathing attack on the Union government ahead of the three-phase Bihar polls later this month and next month. She accused it of diluting all laws that empowered citizens.

“Several laws enacted by the UPA [United Progressive Alliance] government, whether they were for employment, health or education or those associated with labour, farmers, food security, women security and empowerment, have been weakened so much by the Modi government that it is an assault on citizen’s rights. Their rights have been snatched away,”she said.

Crores of youth have lost their jobs, lakhs of micro and small industries have shut shop, farmers were in pain and biggest government employers were being privatised, she alleged.

“You will remember that when the Congress brought in the MGNREGA for rural employment, it was ridiculed. Today, during the corona pandemic, it saved millions from hunger and starvation,” she said. The Congress government formulated policies keeping in mind Gandhi ji’s philosophy of benefitting the weakest person.

While the UPA government acted against any charge of corruption, the Modi government did not bother to answer even queries under the Right to Information Act, she added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qiibj0/article32310107.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-SONIAGANDHI,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/government-run-by-some-by-trading-in-emotions-confusion-fear-sonia/article32753492.ece
25,2020/10/02,"Bihar Assembly election | Rahul, Tejashvi call helps seal seat-sharing in Bihar","NDA partners continue meetings in Delhi, Patna

With the first phase of the Assembly poll in Bihar less than a month away on October 28, a seat-sharing deal is said to have been finalised in the opposition mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) on Friday. Leaders of alliance partners are likely to officially announce the formula this weekend.

However, confusion continued in the NDA, despite several rounds of meetings between party leaders, both in Patna and Delhi.

A day after the RJD and Congress — two major alliance partners of the mahagathbandhan — attacked each other over seat sharing, leaders of both the parties, Tejashwi Yadav and Rahul Gandhi respectively, are said to have had a telephonic discussion on Friday to reach an agreement.

If RJD sources are to be believed, the party is to contest around 134-136 seats leaving 65-68 for Congress and 17-19 for Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), five each for two other Left parties — CPI and CPM — 10-12 seats for the Vikasheel Insaan Party and two for the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM).

Also read: Left to contest Bihar poll under Mahagathbandhan

“Yes, we’ve almost done our seat-sharing among alliance partners and top party leaders are likely to announce it on Saturday or Sunday,” a senior RJD leader told The Hindu. He added that the “seat finalisation was done after Tejashwi Yadav spoke to Rahul Gandhi.”

Leaders spar

Earlier on Thursday, RJD and Congress leaders had exchanged words, blaming each other for trying to “rock the boat”.

Lashing out at RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, heir apparent of party chief Lalu Prasad, Bihar Congress in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil called him “inexperienced” while RJD leader and party spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari hit back saying, “he (Mr Gohil) was trying to rock the boat with his uncalled for comments”.

“The RJD will contest on double the number of seats than Congress parry and all our alliance partners too have been suitably accommodated...now only announcement of the number of seats is to be done,” a senior RJD leader said. The Bihar Assembly has 243 members.

Earlier the two Left parties, CPI and CPI(M), had declared that they would contest the poll along with mahagathbandhan but the CPI(ML) had indicated that it was unhappy with the number of seats allotted.

However, on Friday, the CPI(ML) also is said to have agreed to the deal to contest between 17-19 seats.

Meetings continue

Leaders of NDA partners — JD(U), BJP and LJP — continued to hold separate meetings to reach a consensus.

“Let the time come, you all will come to know about it,” said newly appointed State JD(U) working president Ashok Choudhury after an meeting with party chief Nitish Kumar.

The BJP’s Bihar in-charge Bhupendra Yadav and poll in-charge Devendra Fadnavis, too, met with State party leaders in Patna.

LJP options

Meanwhile, the LJP called a crucial meeting of its parliamentary board on Saturday evening in Delhi to take a final decision on both seat sharing and continued presence in the NDA.

Also read: Bihar Assembly election | LJP almost certain to go it alone

Ties between the LJP and JD(U) have of late soured over several issues. The LJP had declared that it would contest 143 seats against JD(U) candidates. The BJP is said to be working behind the scenes to keep the LJP on board.

The three-phase poll is scheduled to take place on October 28, November 3 and 7 and results will be declared on November 10.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fqgjnd/article31771213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TEJASHWIYADAV,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-election-rahul-tejashvi-call-helps-seal-seat-sharing-in-bihar/article32752975.ece
26,2020/10/02,Remembering SPB: The singer who listened,"In SPB, music directors often found everything they wanted — flourish, lilt and finesse — in one voice

Every now and then, my playlist reminds me of ‘Humne Toh Dil Ko Aapke Qadmon Pe Rakh Diya’, among my favourite Mohammed Rafi-Asha Bhosle duets. I don’t know enough Hindi to fully understand the lyrics, and I need Google to tell me it’s from a 1965 film called Mere Sanam, and that it was composed by O.P. Nayyar, whose name I first heard on TVS Saregama hosted by the mild-mannered Sonu Nigam in the 90s.

Incidentally, of all the video clips that have inundated social media after singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam passed away last fortnight, it is one from a Nigam show that I have been going back to. On the show, speaking of why “Rafi saab” was the singer who had the “maximum influence” on him, SPB goes on to recall his student days when he would cycle to engineering college at 7.30 a.m. every day, and listen to one particular Rafi song and invariably tear up. He then breaks into ‘Deewana hua baadal, saawan ki ghataa chaayee, ye dekh ke dil jhooma’ (from Kashmir Ki Kali, 1964). “That ‘ma’ [in jhooma]… can you imagine anybody else singing it with that sort of beautiful expression?” he says. “The man is coming into your ears, caressing, singing with a smile. How can you not fall in love?!”

On another show, on a Telugu TV channel, SPB sings Rafi’s ‘Jaanewalo Zara Mudke Dekho Mujhe’, a song he loved improvising with, and says, “He [Rafi] is the only person who can sing like that.” Later, when I met him for an interview in 2012, he told me the largest music folder on his phone was dedicated to Rafi.

Over the past few days, listening to SPB on loop, I was excited to catch what I thought were some Rafi-esque touches, especially in ‘Ore Naal Unai Naan Nilavil Parthadu’, his duet with Vani Jayaram for Ilamai Oonjal Aadukirathu that released in 1978 when SPB was in his early 30s. The flavour, pace and three-count rhythmic scape of the beautiful Ilaiyaraaja composition took me back to ‘Humne Toh Dil Ko Aapke Qadmon Pe...,’ but it is really the gentleness and care with which SPB’s voice treats the words and notes that remind me most of Rafi. The caressing that SPB so admired in Rafi.

A glimpse of Rafi

I learnt later that this wasn’t merely my imagination when I found a video clip where SPB says that many of his songs have “a glimpse of Rafi”. He would make a notation saying ‘Rafi’ in certain places on his song scripts, in order to execute a particular glide or vocal effect in those lines. It is not hard to come up with thousands of such examples of SPB’s masterful play with tone and timbre to evoke a certain mood. But what is more fascinating is what SPB does with these various influences, including that of Rafi, because what you hear in an SPB song is not simply a version of another singer but much more. SPB unfailingly acknowledged his many sources of inspiration, but went on to create a whole catalogue of unique vocal expressions that no playback singer after him can afford to overlook.

He brought together the musical traits he relished in Rafi, Kishore Kumar, T.M. Soundararajan (TMS) and P.B. Sreenivas (PBS) — but made them his own. In fact, SPB often spoke about how much he learnt from S. Janaki’s voice dynamics — her modulation, the effortless glide from one note to another, and the tiny embellishments that fall gently like the curled ends of satin ribbons atop a gift-wrapped package.

This is perhaps why, where the male playback industry often came up with two giants at a time — such as Rafi-Kishore or TMS-PBS, to give listeners two distinct styles and listening experiences — with his genius, it was just SPB-SPB for quite a while. This is not to belittle the remarkable contributions made over the years by the other much-loved male singers such as Mukesh, A.M. Raja, K.J. Yesudas, Jayachandran or Malaysia Vasudevan. It is simply to say that with SPB, music directors often found everything they wanted and needed — flourish, lilt and finesse — in one voice.

A master’s mind

All the same, the fact that his voice worked equally well for actors with very different physical and performance attributes does not imply he had a different voice for everyone. However different they may sound or feel, each song has an unmistakable SPB ring to it. That ‘SPB core’ remains intact in all his songs, and co-exists with a sincere, willing and daring musical mind. Sincere to the music director and lyricist’s idea; willing to learn and apply; and daring enough to constantly redraw and expand his comfort zone.

The many tributes to SPB recall with awe how on many days the singer would record over 20 songs. A.R. Rahman talks about how quickly SPB could learn a composition and record it, while others emphasise his unmatched versatility. What these fundamentally point to is his aptitude to grasp new ideas, his incredible musical acumen that processed and internalised them, and his ability to translate these into vocal perfection. Except, SPB had no formal training in any of these aspects. He was a master of his own making.

Above all, when we hear SPB speak about a song — whether his own or another — he comes across first and foremost as a passionate rasika (someone who engages with and deeply enjoys a work of art). You see not a star singer, but a discerning listener, who can make himself vulnerable and drown in the magic of the notes. While acutely aware of his exceptional talent, SPB was grounded in the realisation that all art, including his own, is bigger than the artist.

Alternating between playlists, I chance upon the slow-paced ‘Thoda Thoda Malarndhadhenna’, a brilliant melody by A.R. Rahman. In the line ‘Mazhai vara boomi maruppadhenna’, when I hear SPB gliding through the word ‘boomi’, I get goosebumps. I don’t know if SPB had marked ‘Rafi’ on the margins of the script of this song, but it certainly bears the stamp of India’s best playback singer all over it — it’s called the SPB imprint.

Thankfully, there is enough SPB to last us a lifetime. And enough SPB for millions of his fans to share and yet feel he is singing exclusively to each one of us.",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/u9wpwo/article32751792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04SM-SPBArtfinalgreyhair,https://www.thehindu.com/society/remembering-spb-the-singer-who-listened/article32751793.ece
27,2020/10/02,Gandhi is still a collector’s dream,"October 2 marks 151 years of Gandhi. While Gandhian thought continues to be debated, what is undeniable is his appeal among auction houses and collectors of historic artefacts

Seventy-two years after his death, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is still a subject of intrigue. Recently, when a pair of his glasses was auctioned for a whopping £2,60,000 in Britain, it created a buzz among collectors the world over.

“It is because Gandhi is still and will be relevant forever,” says S Kulandaisamy, honorary secretary of the Gandhi Peace Foundation, Chennai. “But are we relevant to his ideals and thought?” he asks.

October 2 marks 151 years of the Mahatma, and followers of Gandhian thought say he would continue to be discussed and debated.

While the auction house in Bristol that stumbled upon this pair of gold-plated glasses calls it “a find of international historical importance,” collectors such as Bengaluru-based Jayprakash Sarda say that Gandhi has always had an universal appeal.

One among the biggest collectors of Gandhi memorabilia in India, Jayprakash says, he is however, a fan of Subhash Chandra Bose.

Since the auction, East Bristol Auction House has been inundated with requests for valuations on Gandhi-related memorabilia. “Sometimes these were just old coins with his face on them, or magazines. Other items were a little more special, and whilst I can’t say too much, I’m quite certain these glasses won’t be the last time we sell something Gandhi-related,” says Andy Stowe, auctioneer, East Bristol Auctions, in an email interaction.

According to Jayprakash, it is the strange, yet exhilarating feeling of owning a tangible piece of history that keeps him going. He has been collecting Gandhi memorabilia since the 1990s and has everything from stamps to 8,000 pre-Independence newspaper articles, and over 1,000 magazines.

His collection also includes 250 to 300 rare photographs, 30-40 letters written by Gandhi, a set of crockery (with 63 items) issued for VIP delegates of the All India Congress Committee in 1937-38 and a one-kilogram Gandhi silver coin issued by the Republic of Malta. “The crockery carries the Indian flag with the imprint of the charkha on it,” says Jayprakash.

These form only 2% of his collection. A wholesale sari dealer, he keeps track of auctions and collectors and is always on the lookout for a collectible. “It is an expensive passion; but I have been able to support myself so far,” he says. He gets each item verified by experts. “I have converted three rooms in my house to mini museums, which store these valuables,” Jayprakash says.

As part of his work for the Gandhi Peace Foundation, a service organisation that develops Gandhian thought, Kulandaisamy says it is important to spread the Gandhian spirit, especially among younger people today. “Gandhiji was often accused of being a bundle of inconsistencies. But that is because he only saw the truth and truth has an evolving nature,” says the 67-year-old, who has published 45 books of Gandhian stories for children and adults.

Shape of history

Kochi-based sculptor KS Selvaraj, who is currently working on an eight-foot-tall copper sculpture of Gandhi for the National Gandhi Foundation, says he has to imbibe the essence of Gandhi in his physical form as well.

Selvaraj says it is the flexibility of Gandhi’s body that he is trying to recreate in his work. “Gandhiji’s body language is very unique and that is what appeals to me as a sculptor,” he says. Three Gandhi sculptures of his are in different parts of Kochi.

Gandhi will live on, especially in these times of unrest and turmoil, says Stowe: “Religious followers, collectors and museums were all scrambling to own a piece of history. Whether one agrees with his politics or not, no one can deny his enduring image — including his spectacles, loin cloth and sandals.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/o06ja7/article32750161.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2MPGANDHI2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/gandhi-is-still-a-collectors-favourite/article32750162.ece

The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) on Friday said it has disbursed ₹12,298 crore so far under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin (SBM-G) for construction of 3.29 crore household toilets.

To mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the development finance institution has launched a nationwide sanitation literacy campaign.

The campaign, which will continue till January 26, 2021, is aimed at creating awareness among rural populace towards adopting good hygiene and sanitation practices, a release said.

Nabard said the campaign will support the government’s SBM-G and Water, Sanitisation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes to enable the vulnerable rural communities to access better sanitation facilities in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need for greater awareness for better water, sanitisation and hygiene infrastructure and enhanced the significance of the Swachh Bharat Mission,” NABARD Chairman G. R. Chintala said.

This campaign will help engage with vulnerable communities that lack right sanitation facilities and identify further funding requirements, he said.

Under the campaign, NABARD will cover about 2,000 villages and map the sanitation needs of people. Based on the findings, it will develop a strategy to provide credit facilities, mainly for construction of household toilets.

On Thursday, the development finance institution announced a special refinance facility to support the government WASH programme.

31,2020/10/02,An agreement for joint development,"I am a property owner and I wish to enter into a Joint Development Agreement (JDA) with a developer. I have the following queries: 1- Are the JDA agreement, builders agreement and construction agreement the same document? 2. In a JV, is registration compulsory for both, the landowner and apartment buyers in Tamil Nadu (TN)? 3. Please advise on the registration fees in TN, and where it is done in Chennai? 4. Should amendments to the JDA be registered? 5. Does a Supplementary JDA need to be registered?

M. Pavan Kumar

Chennai

At the outset, you should consult your lawyer and chartered accountant before settling the terms with the developer and go by their advice during the course of the project. However the following can be taken as general guidelines.

In a usual joint development scenario, the owner(s) enter into a JDA with the developer setting out the terms of understanding, such as the ratio of sharing of built up area in the proposed building, advance (refundable or non refundable), time for completion of the construction, consequences for delay/default, authority to obtain approvals, undertake construction, mortgage or sale of the developer’s share etc. As on date, there is no provision to register a JDA (including amendments or supplemental deeds) and the same would be valid and enforceable even without registration.

Once the building plans are approved by the statutory authorities, there will be a clarity in the details of the apartments, car parking slots and proportionate undivided share in land. At that point of time, an Allocation Agreement (supplementary agreement) can be executed, following the JDA, earmarking the apartments allotted to each of the parties. If the built up area of flats do not exactly match to the ratio agreed under the JDA, the parties can mutually agree to adjust the same on monetary consideration. The said document also does not require registration.

The developer may also require a Deed of Power of Attorney pursuant to the terms agreed in the JDA.

If the owner(s) retain their share of built up area, construction agreement(s) should be entered into with the developer and the same has to be registered. The stamp duty and registration charges would be 2% of the cost of construction and this document has to be registered in the sub-registrar’s office having jurisdiction over the location of the property.

As regards third party purchasers, sale deeds for undivided share of land and corresponding construction agreement would be registered in their favour. Though the agreements with the developer used to be called as Builders Agreement, after the introduction of TN RERA Rules, it is advisable to adopt the term Construction Agreement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/real-estate/sr5mfv/article32750997.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/flats,https://www.thehindu.com/real-estate/your-legal-queries-answered/article32750998.ece

33,2020/10/02,Trade unions to strike on November 26 against labour laws,"Government accused of trying to snatch workers’ rights.

Ten Central trade unions will observe a nationwide general strike on November 26 to protest against the recent labour laws cleared by Parliament. This was decided at a virtual national convention of the unions and other independent federations held on Friday to coincide with Gandhi Jayanti.

Parliament passed the Industrial Relations Code Bill, 2020, the Code on Social Security Bill, 2020 and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code Bill, 2020 in the recently concluded monsoon session of Parliament.

Indian National Trade Union Congress president G. Sanjeeva Reddy said that for the working class, the Modi government’s rule was worse than the British regime. “The Modi government is trying to snatch the rights we earned after 60 years of struggle. They are taking the worker’s living standards to British era,” Mr. Reddy said. He said that it was important that all trade unions come together at this hour.

All India Trade Union Congress general secretary Amarjeet Kaur said the present government, instead of formulating the policies for the last man in the line, was actually making policies to benefit those at the top of the food chain.

The organisations said the new labour codes had taken away the fundamental right of the worker to go on strike. The unions have collectively drafted seven demands, including cash transfer of ₹7,500 a month for all families that do not pay income tax and 10 kg free ration per month to the needy. The unions have also demanded withdrawal of the new labour and farm laws.

Centre of Indian Trade Unions general secretary Tapan Sen said the government was adamant on selling public sector units and on privatisation. “On November 26, there will be a nationwide general strike. But this is merely the first step, we will constantly oppose Modi government’s every effort to try and sell off public sector companies,” Mr. Sen said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1539a2/article32754436.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LABOURLAWS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/trade-unions-call-strike-on-nov-26-against-labour-laws/article32754437.ece
34,2020/10/02,Narendra Modi praises India’s vaccine developers,"The indigenously developed rotavirus vaccine, or Rotavac, was commercially produced by Bharat Biotech and launched by Narendra Modi in March 2015

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India had “broken its inertia” in vaccine development after 2014 and had introduced four new vaccines into the country’s immunisation programme. “This included an indigenously developed rotavirus vaccine. Recently, we also gave market authorisation for an indigenously developed pneumococcal vaccine,” he said, addressing an online conference of scientists of Indian origin on Friday.

The indigenously developed rotavirus vaccine, or Rotavac, was commercially produced by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and launched by PM Modi in March 2015. However, the vaccine was the culmination of research that began with Phase-1 trials in 2003.

“Our vaccine developers are active and globally competitive during this pandemic,” he added. “Time is of the essence and we have committed to eliminate tuberculosis from India by 2025 — five years ahead of the deadline.”

The VAIBHAV Summit is a global virtual summit of overseas and resident Indian researchers and academicians, and is being organised from October 2 to October 31, 2020. “The aim of the summit is to bring Indian origin luminaries in academic institutes and research and development organizations across the world and resident counterparts on a single platform to debate upon collaboration mechanisms to strengthen academic and science and technology base in India for global development,” said a release by the Prime Minister's Office.

“Sadly, for long, students in India have been fed the lie that everything before the [advent] of modernity was superstition and dark ages. This is the age of computers, programming and mobile phones... And the base of all computing is binary code, which is 1 and 0. When we speak of ‘zero’ how can we not speak of India?” he queried. “The Indian diaspora are excellent ambassadors of India at the world stage,” he added.

The inauguration will be followed by online deliberation sessions. The initiative involves multiple levels of interactions among Indian and overseas experts over a month-long series of webinars, video conferences, etc. More than 3,000 overseas Indian origin academicians and scientists from 55 countries, and more than 10,000 resident academicians and scientists are taking part in the summit. About 200 academic institutes and Science and Technology Departments, led by K. Vijay Raghavan, Principal Scientific Advisor, government of India, are organising the summit all of October.

Over 1,500 panelists from 40 countries, and 200 Indian R&D and academic institutions would virtually deliberate in 18 different areas and 80 topics in more than 200 deliberation sessions.

35,2020/10/02,Jail period or gravity of crime alone can’t decide early release denial: Supreme Court,"Court says reformative justice should also foster brotherhood and mutual acceptability

The length of a prison sentence or the gravity of the crime cannot be the sole basis for denying a convict premature release from jail, the Supreme Court has held in a judgment.

A three-judge Bench of Justices N.V. Ramana, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy said the proclivity to commit a crime upon release “must be based on antecedents as well as the conduct of the prisoner while in jail, and not merely on his age or apprehensions of the victims and witnesses”.

In a judgment on September 30, Justice Kant wrote: “Society has a right to lead a peaceful and fearless life, without free-roaming criminals creating havoc in the lives of ordinary peace-loving citizens. But equally strong is the foundation of reformative theory which propounds that a civilised society cannot be achieved only through punitive attitudes and vindictiveness”.

The court said reformative justice should not merely focus on public harmony, but should foster brotherhood and mutual acceptability. First-time offenders should especially be given a second chance at life. “First -time offenders ought to be liberally accorded a chance to repent their past and look forward to a bright future”, the court observed.

Two prisoners’ plea

The judgment came in a plea made by two prisoners who gave been incarcerated for a botched-up kidnapping for ransom case in Uttar Pradesh. They are in their early middle age with a record of good conduct in jail.

Ordering their release and making it clear their freedom would continue as long as they behaved well, the court reasoned that their “action of kidnapping was nothing but a fanciful attempt to procure easy money, for which they have learnt a painful life lesson”.

Justice Kant said their case ought to be viewed through a “prism of positivity”.

With age still on their side, the court said they could “retain the ability to reintegrate with society and can spend many years leading a peaceful, disciplined, and normal human life”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/v67r5w/article28734168.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/jail,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jail-period-or-gravity-of-crime-alone-cant-decide-early-release-denial-sc/article32753869.ece
36,2020/10/02,Railways to pay wages to contractual staff,"Period of absence during lockdown to be treated as ‘on duty’

The Indian Railways will pay contractual/outsourced staff engaged for various activities on trains and Railway establishments during the COVID-19 lockdown period, when train services were suspended till May 31, 2020. This will benefit thousands of workers who were directly affected by the nationwide lockdown.

In an order to General Managers of all Zonal Railways and Production Houses, the Railway Board referred to the circular of the Ministry of Finance on “payment of wages to outsourced persons of Ministries/Departments and other organisations of Government of India during lockdown period due to COVID-19”, and said payment to contractors should be made after obtaining proof of paying salaries to workers for the previous month.

As part of social distancing and isolation measures due to the spread of the coronavirus, Central/State governments had announced a lockdown across the country. Due to these safety measures, the Ministry of Finance said there was a likelihood of a number of contractual, casual and outsourced workers such as housekeeping staff being required to stay at home, which in normal circumstances would result in deduction in their pay/wages.

“In order to avoid any undue hardships under the prevailing extraordinary circumstances, it has been decided that wherever any such contractual, casual and outsourced staff of Ministries/Departments and other organisation of Government of India is required to stay at home due to the pandemic shall be treated as ‘on duty’ during such period of absence and necessary pay/wages would be paid accordingly,” the order said.

The Indian Railways engages a large number of contractual workers for housekeeping, cleaning, catering, bedroll supply/management, laundry and other services in trains, railway stations and other establishments across its network. These staff are paid by contractors and the bills settled by the Zonal Railways/production houses.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pq8nds/article32522308.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAILWAYS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/railways-to-pay-wages-to-contractual-staff/article32753628.ece

Hundreds of citizens, student groups, activists and politicians gathered at Jantar Mantar here on Friday evening demanding justice for the Hathras gang rape and murder case victim. The protesters demanded Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s resignation alleging increased violence against women and atrocities against Dalits in the State.

Besides the incident, protesters said they were also outraged by what happened after it, including the last rites of the victim not having been performed in her family’s presence. They chanted slogans against the U.P. Police for the manner in which they have handled the case.

Addressing the gathering, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the accused should be hanged at the earliest. “Whatever has happened is painful. The whole episode — the treatment meted out to the victim, the non-registration of the FIR, her not getting proper treatment — this is all very painful,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

He added that there is an impression that attempts are being made to save the accused. “Allow the family to meet whoever they want, don’t put them under lock and key. There should also be no politics on this incident; whether it happens in U.P, Rajasthan or Delhi, the point is that such incidents should not happen,” he said.

Yechury on BJP ‘silence’

CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury lashed out at the silence of the BJP’s top brass on the incident. He said: “Silence of Centre, BJP top brass on Hathras incident and U.P. government’s response speaks volumes about the party’s authoritarian face”.

Hathras gang rape | Victim’s family alleges intimidation by officials

Lawyer and activist Prashant Bhushan alleged that what was happening in U.P. was “goonda raj” and said that the police have surrounded Hathras and are not allowing Opposition leaders and media persons to enter so that the voices of the victim’s family are not heard.

Actor Swara Bhasker called for President’s rule in U.P. and hit out at the government and the police for failing to prevent a crime and also not letting her family perform the last rites.

MLA and activist Jignesh Mewani alleged that the U.P. Police was putting pressure on the victim’s family to sign statements to cover up their failures and was therefore not allowing the media and Opposition leaders to enter Hathras.

Bhim Army Chief Chandrasekhar Aazad called for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to break his silence and for the Supreme Court to intervene in the matter. “I will visit Hathras and ensure that the victim gets justice. We will not stop our protest until the U.P. Chief Minister resigns,” Mr. Aazad said.

Students’ voice

At the protest, there were a large number of students as well.

All India Student Association Secretary (Delhi) Prasenjeet Kumar said U.P. has become a State where rapists and culprits get protection from the government. “In Unnao, Kuldeep Sengar was protected. And once again this is happening. Without 100% conviction rate, rape culture cannot be stopped. The district-level officers must be booked under SC/ST Act immediately,” said Mr. Kumar.

The protest was supposed to be at India Gate but after the police barricaded the area, the venue was shifted to Jantar Mantar. The entry gates of Janpath, Rajiv Chowk and Patel Chowk metro station were closed to prevent people from gathering at Jantar Mantar after the crowd started growing.

Phase VII of the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) to repatriate Indians stranded abroad due to COVID-19 has commenced and 1,067 flights will be operated till October last.

This phase, announced on the basis of an assessment of the demand for seats from among NRIs and their families and the feedback from Indian missions, is an extended phase of VBM VI.

The 1,067 flights will be operated by Air India, its butget airline Air India Express and IndiGo. Air India Express alone has 496 flights and 197 of them are to the four international airports in Kerala. These airlines will also operate outbound flights, with Air India Express alone getting 448 flights.

Air India will operate flights from Sydney, Vancouver, Toronto, Hong Kong, Paris CDG, Frankfurt, Tel Aviv, Tokyo, Nairobi, Male, Yangon, Lagos, Washington DC, New York and London. Air India Express will concentrate on Bahrain, Kuwait, Malaysia, Singapore, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Airline sources said the inbound flights have a load factor of 80 to 85 per cent and NRI families were making use of them, especially from the Middle East countries. The delay in commencing services was leading to an increasing demand for seats in these flights.

However, the outbound flights of these airlines do not have much patronage. The demand is for seats to Dubai and Muscat and there is good movement of those getting fresh visas. The government is yet to give the nod to carry passengers to Saudi Arabia.

As many as 900 international flights were operated from 22 countries to 23 airports across India in VBM Phase V.

40,2020/10/02,"Over 1,600 kg of gold seized till September","Rising prices, flight curbs spur smuggling from Myanmar, say officials

The over 30% increase in the price of gold in India has led to a spurt in smuggling in the past one year and enforcement agencies seizing more than 1,600 kg of gold from across the country.

“The share of middlemen and carriers goes up with the increase in gold price. Most of the smuggled gold of foreign origin is ultimately traced to Dubai or Thailand. Gold is currently worth about ₹50 lakh per kg in India,” said a customs official.

On Friday, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) seized about 33 kg of gold worth ₹17.51 kg from a truck in West Bengal’s Siliguri district and arrested four persons. The consignment was smuggled in from Myanmar via Manipur and was destined to Sri Ganganagar in Rajasthan.

2,112 cases

Till August this year, as many as 2,112 cases of gold seizures were reported by various agencies. About 484 kg of gold was seized in February, while in March the figure was 205.81 kg and 280.66 kg in April. However, due to the lockdown measures, no seizures were made in May and only 37.54 kg of gold was impounded in June.

“Gold is smuggled through both the air and land routes. International flights were banned as part of the lockdown guidelines. Therefore, the land routes have become more active. A spurt in the gold smuggling through the Indo-Myanmar, Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bangladesh borders has been noticed,” the official said.

Delhi haul

In August, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) arrested eight persons with 504 gold bars weighing 83.62 kg worth ₹43 crore at the New Delhi railway station. They were on board the Dibrugarh-New Delhi Rajdhani Express.

The gold bars were smuggled in from Myanmar via Manipur, through a Guwahati-based syndicate and were destined for major cities like Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai for disposal.

Two more major seizures of 10.30 kg and 26.56 kg were made on the Imphal-Moreh Road, close to the Myanmar border, and at the New Jalpaiguri railway station. In both the cases, the agency suspects that the gold was smuggled in from Myanmar.

The same month, a total of 101 cases with the seizure of about 185 kg of gold was reported by the agencies.

Five more cases were reported by the DRI in September, including two from Guwahati and one from Siliguri. “In July, 15kg of gold was seized by the agency in Kolkata,” the official said, adding that the number of seizures had increased after the lockdown restrictions were lifted.

In July, the enforcement agencies registered 104 cases and seized 127.70 kg of gold. The same month, on July 5, 30 kg of gold was seized by the Customs Department from a diplomatic bag at the Thiruvananthapuram airport. The bag was to be delivered at the UAE Consulate.

41,2020/10/02,NIA files charge-sheet against three men trained in Pakistan to carry out attacks in India: official,"The case relates to subversive activities of the LeT in Kulgam

The NIA has filed a charge-sheet against three persons who allegedly underwent training in Pakistan to carry out terrorist attacks in India on the instructions of Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), an official said.

The charge-sheet against Muneeb Hameed Bhat, Junaid Ahmad Mattoo and Umer Rashid Wani, all residents of Jammu and Kashmir’s Kulgam district, was filed before a special NIA court in Jammu on Thursday.

It was filed under sections of the Ranbir Penal Code and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), the official said.

Mattoo and Wani were killed in separate encounters in Jammu and Kashmir in 2017 and 2018, respectively, the NIA official said.

The case relates to subversive activities of the LeT in Kulgam. It was motivating youths such as Bhat to join the terror group and organised their travel to Pakistan for terrorist training on the basis of valid travel documents following the recommendation of separatist leaders, the NIA official said.

Investigations by the NIA, which took over the case on September 25, 2018, established that LeT terrorist Mattoo motivated Bhat to join the LeT and go to Pakistan for terrorist training, the NIA spokesperson said. He added that Wani, another LeT terrorist, gave him funds to meet the expenses of his visit to the neighbouring country.

In July-August 2017, Bhat visited Pakistan on valid travel documents and was imparted training on using weapons and secret social media chat platforms, the official of the premier investigation agency said.

After returning from Pakistan, he was in constant touch with LeT handlers in Pakistan and with active militants of Kulgam on secret messaging platforms to carry out subversive and terrorist activities in the Valley, the NIA spokesperson said.

Bhat was working as a sleeper cell of the LeT and intended to join the banned terrorist organisation, the official said.

From 2016-2018, many Kashmiri youths were sent by separatist leaders to Pakistan, he added.

They were trained in the camps for five to 15 days. After returning, they were initially used as sleeper cells by militant organisations and subsequently recruited for active militancy, the official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mruvl3/article32752624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/nia,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nia-files-charge-sheet-against-three-men-trained-in-pakistan-to-carry-out-attacks-in-india-official/article32752626.ece

“Government has responded to address the concerns of the elderly by recognising them as a vulnerable population category for COVID efforts, issuing advisories, raising awareness of their special needs, encouraging State governments to develop need-based models for delivery of medications and home-based care to the elderly,”’ he said.

The Ministry added that India has sustained the steady trend of active cases being lower than the 10 lakh mark for 11 days in an unbroken chain.

“The number of active cases on Friday is 9,42,217 with 78,877 recoveries registered in the last 24 hours in the country. India’s total recoveries are 53,52,078 today.

43,2020/10/02,"Can’t keep deferring labour reforms in the name of consultation, says Labour Minister Gangwar","The existing labour laws fell short in responding to the changed world of work

The recently passed Code on Social Security, the Industrial Relations Code and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, which along with the Code on Wages, 2019 subsume 29 labour laws into four codes, were passed after widespread consultations, says Union Labour and Employment Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar

Also read: A wage code that is a hasty composition

There has been criticism about the manner in which the three labour codes were passed. How would you address the criticism that the Bills were not sent to the Standing committee again and there was lack of consultation with the stakeholders on the final draft of the Bills?

I wish to clarify that the final draft of the Codes has been framed after wide-ranging consultations with all stakeholders. The labour reforms exercise which culminated recently was initiated on the basis of the recommendations of the Second National Commission on Labour, 2002, which had recommended to subsume then existing Central labour legislations into four or five Codes. It was from 2014 onwards that our government took active steps towards codification exercise.

I would like to inform that the Labour Ministry seeks to always ensure tripartite consultations in its decision-making. In this context an extensive consultation process was adopted wherein all stakeholders including trade unions, employer associations, state governments, international organisations and citizens were consulted. Various consultation processes were held along with seeking the comments of general public by placing the draft codes on the website. Subsequent to this broad consultations, various modifications were made. Many suggestions of trade unions including recognition of trade unions at unit, State and Central level and providing mechanism for inter-trade union dispute resolution through industrial tribunals were accepted. Lastly, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on labour after scrutinising the labour codes and consulting all stakeholders gave 233 recommendations out of which about 74% of the recommendations were accepted by the Government.

After such broad consultations at various platforms, I don’t think that the statement about lack of consultation on Codes is justified. We cannot keep on referring the Bills again and again to committees and in the name of consultation process keep deferring the much needed reforms.

Was there adequate discussion on the Bills given that the Opposition had boycotted the session? Were the Bills rushed?

It is unfortunate that the Opposition did not participate in the discussion on these important Bills brought in the interest of workers having positive impact on the lives of millions of our workers. The existing labour laws fell short in responding to the changed world of work and a need for a comprehensive labour law reform exercise was felt from long.

How will the four labour codes change the lives of workers? And when will they be implemented?

These labour Codes will bring qualitative change in the lives of our workers and they seek to achieve the twin objective of securing the basic rights of the workers and facilitating employment generation.

These labour Codes seek to universalise the right to minimum wage of workers, presently available to only about 30% of the workforce engaged in the scheduled employments. Apart from this, the right to timely payment of wages without any unauthorised deduction has been universalised for all employees. The OSH Code seeks to establish a dynamic occupational safety regulatory framework in consonance with the changing technology and working conditions. The IR Code strengthens the dispute resolution machinery in the industrial establishments besides enabling effective participation of Trade Unions. The Code on Social Security takes a significant step towards ensuring a universal coverage of all organised and particularly unorganised workers in the social security net.

The Rule-making exercise for the Codes has been initiated and we will implement these Codes after framing of subordinate legislations.

What is the status of the draft rules under the Code on Wages? How many comments have been received? And by when it will be implemented?

The Draft Rules on the Code on Wages were published in the official Gazette for seeking public comments on 7 July, 2020. Large number of comments from the trade unions, employer’s associations and general public have been received and are being analysed. The Rule making exercise for the Code on Wages would be finalised after consideration of all the comments of the stakeholders.

Unions have raised concerns that the Code will promote hire and fire and adversely impact the right to strike. The Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh has said industrial peace will be affected. How do you address this? And is there any plan to reach out to unions on this?

I wish to clarify certain misconceptions on this aspect. While framing the Codes we had the objective to enhance the workers’ welfare along with facilitating job creation. The Codes have introduced the concept of fixed term employment taking into consideration the reality of increasing contract workers who are often exploited by the contractor and discriminated in comparison to a regular employee. Thus an option to engage workers on fixed term has been introduced duly ensuring that fixed term employee is treated at par with regular employee of establishment in all aspects including pro rata payment of gratuity.

Further, another misconception is about increase of threshold from 100 to 300 for seeking permission before retrenchment/lay-off or closure. In this regard, I wish to inform through you that this threshold has been already been done by 16 State governments and retaining the threshold of 100 would not have served much purpose. The increase of threshold from 100 to 300 was recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. Low threshold for seeking permission before retrenchment, layoff or closure does not serve much purpose but on the contrary promotes dwarfism of establishments. This is also evident from the few industrial establishments in the country having more than 100 workers. Thus when holistically understood, the increase of threshold to 300 will lead to formalisation of workforce, encourage labour intensive production and encourage establishment of bigger enterprises.

Further, in addition to the benefits envisaged for retrenched workers, the IR Code, 2020 has constituted a Reskilling fund in order to enable re-skilling of retrenched workers and facilitate them in finding new employment.

I also wish to emphasise that the requirement for a 14 days’ notice prior to proceeding on strike in any establishment by a Trade Union is contemplated to enhance the industrial peace and harmony without compromising on the workers right to strike. The objective for this is to prevent uncontemplated breakdown of production in an establishment and to create an opportunity for amicable settlement of the disputes between workers and management through conciliation. Lastly, for the first time provisions for strengthening and ensuring effective collective bargaining has been incorporated in law through the provision for a Negotiating Union or Negotiating Council at unit level and the recognition of unions at the State and Central level.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/e7q752/article32752432.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GANGWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cant-keep-deferring-labour-reforms-in-the-name-of-consultation-says-labour-minister-gangwar/article32752433.ece

45,2020/10/02,Nirav Modi case: Fresh CBI charge sheet against retired PNB official for disproportionate assets,"‘The CBI looked into the relationship between Gokulnath Shetty and Modi-Choksi during which it dug into the assets amassed by the retired deputy manager’

The CBI has filed a fresh charge sheet against Gokulnath Shetty, the Punjab National Bank Deputy Manager who allegedly helped Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi perpetrate ₹13,000-crore fraud, and his wife for amassing disproportionate assets worth ₹2.63 crore, officials said Friday.

The agency has charged Mr. Shetty and his wife Asha Latha Shetty, a clerk in Indian Bank, under corruption charges for amassing assets worth over ₹4.28 crore during the period 2011-17 when the scam was being perpetrated at the Brady House branch of PNB in Mumbai where he was posted, they said.

Of the total assets, the CBI alleged they could not provide satisfactory explanation for assets worth ₹ 2.63 crore, which were 2.38 times disproportionate to their known sources of income.

The CBI looked into the relationship between Mr.Shetty and Modi-Choksi during which it dug into the assets amassed by the retired deputy manager, they said.

The agency has registered a separate FIR in November, 2018 against Mr. Shetty and his wife to look into their assets.

It emerged that against a genuine income of ₹72.52 lakh during a six-year period, the Shetty couple had assets in their as well as family members’ names primarily in the form of flats in Mumbai, the CBI alleged.

In its charge sheet filed before a Mumbai special court recently, the agency has said that they had purchased a flat worth ₹46.62 lakh in Goregaon while paid advance booking amount for three more flats in various localities of Mumbai and neighbouring areas.

In addition, the agency also detected fixed deposits, bank balance and recurring accounts of over ₹75 lakh.

After computing investments, income and expenditure, the CBI concluded that Shetty and his wife allegedly amassed disproportionate assets to the tune of Rs 2.63 crore during 2011-17, they said.

The CBI has already filed charge sheets against Mr. Modi and Mr. Choksi in which role of Mr. Shetty, presently in judicial custody, is given, they said.

Mr. Shetty, who is alleged to have played a key role in the ₹13,700-crore loan fraud while working as the deputy manager at PNB’s Brady House branch in Mumbai, was arrested in March, 2018.

The scam surfaced when the companies owned by Modi and Choksi approached the Brady Road branch in January 2018, after the retirement of Shetty in 2017, seeking renewal of Letter of Undertaking (LoU) for payments to suppliers.

Mr. Shetty, the then Deputy Manager at Brady House branch of the PNB, had continued in the same seat for seven years and issued fraudulent LoUs with “impunity”, the CBI has alleged.

It is alleged that Mr. Shetty albeit a junior officer enjoyed clearance level much higher than his post which gave him full powers in Finacle, internal software used by PNB for verifying large transactions.

It is alleged Mr. Shetty bypassed PNB’s core banking system Finacle and issued LoUs fraudulently, they said.

The investigations revealed that messages for fraudulent LoUs were sent to overseas banks by misusing international messaging system for banking called SWIFT platform and without making their subsequent entries in Finacle thus bypassing any scrutiny of such funds in the bank, they said.

An LoU is a guarantee which is given by an issuing bank to Indian banks having branches abroad to grant a short-term credit to the applicant.

In case of default, the bank issuing the LoU has to pay the liability to the credit-giving bank along with accruing interest.

The companies of Mr. Modi and Mr. Choksi took loans from banks abroad on the basis of these LoUs but did not repay them transferring the liability on PNB.

It is alleged that senior officials of the PNB, including the then CEO and MD, did not implement the circulars and caution notices issued by the Reserve Bank of India regarding safeguarding SWIFT operation and misrepresented the factual position to the RBI.

Reconciliation of CBS and SWIFT messages was not done despite repeated RBI circulars caution notices and questionnaires, the CBI has alleged.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ym5qtt/article32752117.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-FRAUDPUNJABNATLBANK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirav-modi-case-fresh-cbi-charge-sheet-against-retired-pnb-official-for-disproportionate-assets/article32752118.ece
46,2020/10/02,"Intention to abet suicide cannot be assumed, it has to be evident: Supreme Court","Benchsays every crime should be backed by a ‘state of mind’ or mens rea or intention

The intention to abet suicide cannot be assumed and it needs to be backed by solid, visible proof, the Supreme Court held in a judgment.

A three-judge Bench of Justices N.V. Ramana, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy said every crime should be backed by a “state of mind” or mens rea or intention.

The police have to establish that an accused wanted to abet the suicide. ‘Abetment’ is defined in Section 107 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Its ingredients consist of instigating a person or to intentionally aid a person to do or not do something. Similarly, the crime of ‘abetment of suicide’ under Section 306 of the IPC involves instigating or actively aiding a person to take his own life. Abetting a person to commit suicide should be intentional, deliberate and calculated, it said.

The police cannot assume the intention (mens rea) of the abettor of a suicide. It has to be evident, it held.

“In order to prove mens rea, there has to be something on record to establish or show that the appellant herein had a guilty mind and in furtherance of that state of mind, abetted the suicide of the deceased. The ingredient of mens rea cannot be assumed to be ostensibly present but has to be visible and conspicuous”, Justice Roy, who authored the judgment, said.

The judgment came on an appeal filed by Gurcharan Singh, who was convicted of abetting the suicide of his wife 22 years ago in Punjab.

Found guilty

The trial court found him guilty, saying the woman was pushed into taking her own life when her hopes of a happy relationship was dashed by his “wilful neglect”. There was, however, no direct evidence of any cruelty on his part towards her. The trial court had even acquitted the man of dowry harassment charges.

The High Court agreed with the trial court, saying the death was a cause of the “circumstances and the atmosphere” at home.

In his appeal before the Supreme Court, Singh argued about the complete lack of evidence to show that he had instigated or intentionally aided his wife to take her own life. There was no clarity about “which particular hope or expectation” of hers was frustrated by him. There was no proof that he wilfully neglected her, he said.

Setting aside his conviction, the apex court said it cannot make conjectures about why a young woman with two small children chose to take her own life.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r0z0ca/article32717631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/intention-to-abet-suicide-cannot-be-assumed-it-has-to-be-evident-sc/article32751417.ece
47,2020/10/02,"PM Modi is doing grave injustice to farmers, says Sonia Gandhi","Rahul Gandhi expected to take part in tractor rally in Punjab and Haryana between Oct. 3 and 5

Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday termed the recently enacted agricultural laws and accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of committing a grave injustice to farmers. She reiterated the party’s resolve to fight against them and stand with farmers.

In a video statement, released by the party on the occasion of the birth anniversaries of Mahatma Gandhi and former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, she said the party’s workers in every Assembly segment of the country were agitating against the laws.

Rahul expresses solidarity

Separately, former party chief Rahul Gandhi expressed his solidarity with farmers and the working class. “The hard work of our country’s labour and farmers is the best example of Atmanirbharta [self-reliance]. They deserve respect and must get the right remuneration for their hard work,” he tweeted with the slogan Jai Shramik, Jai Jawaan, Jai Kisan.

Mr. Gandhi is expected to take part in a tractor rally in Punjab and Haryana between October 3 and 5 to express solidarity with farmers.

In her statement, Ms. Gandhi said, “Today is the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the biggest sympathiser of farmers, labourers and the working class people. He used to say that India’s soul lives in her villages, her agricultural fields. Today is also the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri ji who gave us the slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kisan. But today the farmers and agricultural workers are protesting against three black laws on the streets. Those who give their blood and toil to feed the country are now being forced to shed tears of blood by the Modi government”.

‘Mandis will go’

While farmers and agricultural workers have adopted the Gandhian way of protest to ensure that remunerative price for their produce was expressly mentioned in the law, the Modi government was raining lathis on them, she alleged. The news laws would not only end mandis (agricultural markets) and thereby snatch the livelihoods of small traders, but also encourage hoarding

“The Prime Minister is doing grave injustice to farmers. They are being treated in an unjust manner as the government didn’t even consult them [farmers] before making new laws for them. Ignoring farmers’ interest, the government enacted these three anti-farmer black laws after talking to their few friends,” she stated.

The Congress always made laws with public consent as it should be in a democracy. “Perhaps the Modi government does not remember that it was not able to change the ‘Right to Adequate Compensation Law’ for rights of farmers through an ordinance,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/e7fls4/article32459580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/soniaz,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-is-doing-grave-injustice-to-farmers-says-sonia-gandhi/article32751151.ece
48,2020/10/02,Air India cancels all Frankfurt flights till October 14,"The cancellation comes after Germany withdrew permission to operate the flights.

Air India has cancelled all 12 flights between Frankfurt and India till October 14 after Germany withdrew permission to operate them, said senior government officials on Thursday.

Two days ago, Lufthansa said it will have to cancel all “planned flights” between India and Germany from September 30 to October 20 because of an “unexpected rejection” of its flight schedule by the Indian authorities.

The government officials said Thursday the airline has cancelled 10 Delhi-Frankfurt flights and two Bengaluru-Frankfurt flights that were scheduled till October 14.

“The permission for all Frankfurt flights till October 14 has been withdrawn by the German authorities,” said one of the officials.

Air India did not respond to the request for a statement from PTI on this matter.

Lufthansa said on Tuesday it had applied for continuation of the special flights it was allowed to operate until the end of September but would now have to cancel the flights because of the “unexpected rejection.”

The German carrier said it “sincerely urges” Indian authorities to work together with the German government to establish a temporary travel agreement between both the countries.

However, Indian aviation regulator DGCA said Tuesday that there are restrictions in place for Indian nationals desiring to travel to Germany which was putting Indian carriers at a significant disadvantage resulting in inequitable distribution of traffic in favour of Lufthansa.

“As against Indian carriers operating 3-4 flights a week, Lufthansa operated 20 flights a week. In spite of this disparity we offered to clear 7 flights a week for Lufthansa which was not accepted by them. Negotiations continue,” it noted.

Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus lockdown.

49,2020/10/02,"Several of our legislations have been strong enablers of women empowerment, says Smriti Irani at UNGA","Union Minister for Women and Child Development was among over 150 Prime Ministers, Presidents and Ministers who addressed high-level meeting

Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani addressed the United Nations General Assembly early on Friday morning on the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action to highlight India’s achievements in gender equality.

Minister Irani was among over 150 Prime Ministers, Presidents and Ministers who addressed the UNGA’s High-Level meeting held under the theme “Accelerating the realization of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls”.

The High-Level meeting is an opportunity for Member States to demonstrate political will and leadership for the implementation of the Beijing Declaration — a resolution adopted on September 15, 1995 on the principles of gender equality.

Ms. Irani spoke about a shift in India “from a paradigm of women’s development to women-led development”, which is a theme that first found mention in the Bharatiya Janata Party’s manifesto ahead of the 2019 general elections.

“Several of our legislations, such as those pertaining to sexual harassment of women at workplace, protection of women from domestic violence, protection of children from sexual offences, and our criminal laws’ amendments, have been strong enablers of women empowerment and protection of children, especially girls, over the past six years,” Ms. Irani said.

She also mentioned reservation for women in local bodies such as the panchayat; the ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ scheme; and the linking “over 200 million women” with the formal banking system as efforts to ensure gender equality.

Talking about the government’s efforts to ensure the protection of women during the COVID-19 pandemic, she said, “The government of India took a series of measures for ensuring safety, security and well-being of women during the COVID pandemic. These included One Stop Centres providing medical, psychological, legal, police and shelter facilities under a common roof. Additionally, during the pandemic all efforts are being made to ensure community care for women, especially pregnant and lactating women and women in vulnerable situations.”

However, activists said the omissions on caste and religious divide, and domestic violence, were glaring in her speech.

“Different governments in the world today are pushing behind women’s agenda. There needs to be a conducive environment for these global agendas to work and ensure transformative changes,” said Ruth Manorama, Dalit women’s rights activist.

She added, “I want to ask how many women today are in decision-making roles. While Jan Dhan accounts give women ₹500, what about economic stability for women to ensure that they are able to turn this amount into ₹50,000? The omissions in the speech about religious and caste problems are also telling. The government should ensure that through education and quality curriculum, these retrograde thoughts that divide the society are removed.”

“The Minister in her speech says that women are half the population, but the lack of priority given to women’s needs and safety can be seen from the budget of the Ministry of Women and Child Development, where a mere 4% of the budget has been allocated towards services and empowerment of women, and prevention of crimes. There is a lack of acknowledgement of the challenges faced during the COVID-19 lockdown, such as the rise in domestic violence cases. At the grassroots level, we saw the inability of women to access counselling, medical, legal, shelter and other services since they were mostly non-functional and unavailable. Acknowledging the problem would be the first step towards a solution,” said founder-director of Swayam, an NGO based in Kolkata, which is also the secretariat for the Aman Network, a coalition of NGOs and individuals working on curbing domestic violence.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/82yguz/article32750461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN02UNITEDNATIONSEQUALITYFORWOMEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/several-of-our-legislations-have-been-strong-enablers-of-women-empowerment-says-smriti-irani-at-unga/article32750435.ece

51,2020/10/02,"Peace in India and its rivalry with China will determine Asian future, says Prof. Sugata Bose","He was delivering the inaugural Mushirul Hasan Memorial Lecture of Jamia Milia Islamia.

Peace and harmony in India are essential for Asian future, said Prof. Sugata Bose of the Harvard University. Delivering the inaugural Mushirul Hasan Memorial Lecture of Jamia Milia Islamia on Thursday, the academic remarked that Asian universalism’s future in the 21st century will be determined by the rivalry between India and China which is intensifying.

“Mahatma Gandhi understood that peace and unity of India was the precondition for contributing to the universalism of Asia,” said Prof. Sugata Bose delivering the lecture on “Asian Universalism in the Age of Nationalism” which was held virtually. The scholar and academic pointed out that the Asian universalism came up on the common anti-colonial agenda. The agenda, he noted, gave a chance to nationalist China and India as well as Japan and several countries to unite in the early 20th century.

The scholar said Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore and Sun Yat-sen were the leading proponents of the Asian universalism that began to fall apart after Japan joined the western trend of aggressive nationalism and pursued imperial policies. Mahatma Gandhi, he noted, was disturbed by the Japanese imperialism. Prof. Bose, Gardiner Professor of History in the Harvard University, remarked the Asian universalism was destroyed by the violence between China and Japan during the early 20th century.

In the backdrop of the crisis of nationalism driven state system in Europe of the early 20th century, the Asian universalism was a hope that came up as an alternative to the European “integration”. He said interconnected and inter-referential Asia was to contribute to the global development. “Societies can become each other’s point of reference,” he said arguing in favour of generous universalism against narrow and hubris-driven nationalism.

He also pointed out through documented records that the Indian Muslims too participated in this process.

Indian Muslims were unanimous in prioritising the nation state over Islamic universalism that was influenced by the developments in the Arabian peninsula after the arrival of the Ibn Saud in the mid-1920s. He said the relation of the Indian Muslim with the West Asian region was strengthened during the Khilafat movement but the leadership participated in the international movement while maintaining its priority in the regional developments.

Prof. Bose said Japan’s imperial attitude in the 1920s and 1930s disappointed Rabindranath Tagore. The idea of Asia appealed to Tagore, said the scholar pointing at the deep interconnections that existed between India, Japan, western Asia and the Southeast Asia.

He urged for better understanding between the contemporary Asian powers to ensure a future free from narrow nationalism which, he noted, is currently being played out in the relationship among various countries of Asia. At the virtual event, various scholars recollected the academic contribution of Prof. Mushirul Hasan who had served as the Vice-Chancellor of the Jamia Milia Islamia during 2004-2009.

52,2020/10/02,Pakistan exploiting death of Pakistani Hindus in Jodhpur: MEA,"Interim response on the case has been shared with Pak. High Commission, says Anurag Srivastava

Islamabad is manipulating the case of Pakistani Hindus who were found dead in Jodhpur in August, an official of the Ministry of External Affairs said on Thursday. Addressing the weekly media conference of the Ministry of External Affairs, official spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said investigation is currently on in the death of 11 members of Pakistan’s minority Hindu community in Rajasthan.

“We sought facts from the authorities and an interim response was shared with the Pakistan High Commission on August 11. We also stated that these people were in India since 2015 and the cause of death was the consumption of a toxic substance. Unfortunately, this incident has been used by Pakistan to further its anti-India propaganda,” said Mr. Srivastava.

The deaths have drawn considerable attention in Pakistan after Ramesh Vankwani, Member of National Assembly of Pakistan and patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Hindu Council, took up the matter and held a media conference. He urged India and Pakistan to uncover the facts of the case. The relatives of the deceased individuals have been agitating in Pakistan and have sought the help of the Imran Khan government.

The Pakistan government has been urging India to share the findings. During last week’s protest, members of the Hindu community in Pakistan clashed with police personnel in Islamabad.

53,2020/10/02,Plea for probe into Centre’s COVID-19 preparedness dismissed,"Several former bureaucrats had moved SC alleging “gross mismanagement”

The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed a petition filed by several former bureaucrats to set up an Inquiry Commission to look into the government’s COVID-19 preparedness.

A Bench of Justices L. Nageswara Rao and Ajay Rastogi said the court was not inclined to hear their plea alleging “gross mismanagement” on the part of the Centre in its preparations for the pandemic.

The petition was filed by six former bureaucrats, represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan,

They had contended that mismanagement occurred at multiple levels, from not stocking enough protective and medical equipment to combat the health crisis to lack of early checking of incoming international passengers and handling the exodus of migrant workers during the lockdown. They said the extensive lockdown, which was imposed overnight, had a “devastating effect” on the life of ordinary people and violated their fundamental right to live with dignity by earning their livelihood. The lockdown has had a crippling effect on the economy.

The petition filed by the former bureaucrats like K.P. Fabian, M.G.

54,2020/10/02,"Chargesheet against Hafiz Saeed, others","ED probe reveals “hawala” transactions.

The Enforcement Directorate has filed a chargesheet against Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) chief Hafiz Saeed, the Pakistan-based terrorist who is also the founder of the Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) and the Falah-i-Insaniyat Foundation (FIF), and others in a terror-funding case.

Among those arraigned are Hafiz Saeed’s deputy Shahid Mehmood, one Salman, Dubai-based Pakistan national Mohammed Kamran, and Mohammed Salim, an alleged “hawala” operator from Delhi.

The ED probe is based on a chargesheet filed by the NIA under various provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, against Salman, Salim and Kamran. It is alleged that Salman received funds from FIF operators and his associates through the “hawala” channel. “FIF is a Pakistan-based terror organisation established by JuD ... The Foundation was designated a terrorist organisation by the United Nations on March 14, 2012. Hafiz Saeed was also designated a global terrorist. FIF, a front of LeT and JuD, was floated to evade sanctions,” said an ED official.

The Indian government also declared the FIF a terror outfit on August 12, 2016, while the U.S. Department of State had added it as an alias of the LeT in November 2010.

“This was done with an intention to stem the flow of finances and resources through FIF to LeT and also to prosecute those knowingly providing funds and material support to the terrorist outfits,” said the official.The ED probe revealed that funds were routed from Pakistan to Dubai and then to India through the “hawala” channels. “Salman received the money sent by Kamran and his associates, Abdul Aziz Behlim and Arif Gulambashir Dharampuria, in Dubai. The NIA had seized documents during searches on the premises of suspects, corroborating the ‘hawala’ transactions.”

Salman also allegedly used the funds received from abroad to construct a mosque in Haryana’s Palwal, where he also got the girls of poor families married.

Based on the findings, the ED has quantified the proceeds of crime to the tune of ₹4.69 crore. Salman’s three properties in Delhi, worth ₹73.12 lakh, have been attached so far. “Salman and Salim are in judicial custody,” the official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4k5sg/article32746903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19HAFIZSAEED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chargesheet-against-hafiz-saeed-others/article32746904.ece

APCC president S. Sailajanath has alleged that a conspiracy is being made to turn farmers into bonded labourers.

A protest was organised by the Congress party demanding withdrawal of the three farm Acts enacted by the Centre, at the Gandhi statue, near GVMC, here on Friday.

Addressing the gathering, Mr. Sailajanath said the Acts were detrimental to the interests of farmers. He recalled that the Congress government had provided free power to the farmers in the past. The fixing of meters to agricultural pump sets would deprive the farmers of free power.

57,2020/10/02,Governor pays rich tributes to Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri,"‘Principles of truth and non-violence remain relevant for all times’

Leaders of various political parties paid rich tributes to Mahatma Gandhi on his 151st birth anniversary on Friday. They also recalled the services of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, whose birth anniversary too was celebrated on the day.

Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan, while paying tributes to the Father of the Nation and Lal Bahadur Shastri, said Gandhi, who made the supreme sacrifice, was an inspiration to the world leaders.

Stating that his principles of truth and non-violence would remain relevant for all times, the Governor urged people to follow in his footsteps and lead a righteous life.

Village secretariats

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said his government had been following in the footsteps of Mahatma Gandhi in letter and spirit.

Mahatma Gandhi’s principles of truth and non-violence were very much relevant in the present context, the Chief Minister said in his tributes.

On his Twitter handle, the Chief Minister said the State was moving forward by adopting Mahatma Gandhi’s principle of Grama Swaraj by setting up village secretariats last year on the Gandhi Jayanthi day.

‘Peace icon’

Greeting the people on the occasion through Facebook, BJP State president Somu Veerraju said Mahatma Gandhi was a peace icon, who showed the light of truthfulness to the world.

On Lal Bahadur Shastri, the BJP leader said that he had sacrificed his Minister’s post owning moral responsibility for a train accident. His slogan of ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kisan’ had aptly explained the importance of soldiers and farmers, he added.

‘Potent weapons’

JSP president Pawan Kalyan said Mahatma Gandhi demonstrated to the world how peace and non-violence could be used as potent weapons against injustice.

“Gandhi is a global icon who waged a relentless battle against the British empire, not by violent means but through peaceful ways, which has few parallels,” Mr. Pawan said.

Officials of the Education Department recalled the contribution of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri to the nation.

Calling for adoption of Gandhian ideals such as truth, non-violence, peace and love in the education policy, we would be able to inspire the world, said B. Rajasekhar, Principal Secretary, School Education, at a programme organised at the Samagra Shiksha office.

At the National Institute of Technology, Tadepalligudem, the celebrations started with the ‘Fit India Freedom Run’ flagged off by its Director C.S.P. Rao. He said, “Mahatma Gandhi was, is and will always remain a hero for his path-breaking ways to win hearts and wars.”

Stating that programmes such as ‘Swachhta Hi Seva’ were inspired by Gandhian principles, he urged people to become a part of the cleanliness drive in their respective areas.

At VIT-Andhra Pradesh, Registrar C.L.V. Sivakumar said Mahatma Gandhi's teachings were most relevant in this day and age of conflict and strife.

He also spoke about the ‘White Revolution’ and ‘Green Revolution’ pioneered by Lal Bahadur Shastri.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/governor-pays-rich-tributes-to-mahatma-gandhi-and-lal-bahadur-shastri/article32755236.ece
58,2020/10/02,Harsha Kumar decides to return to Congress,"‘Party always stood by Dalits and tribal people’

Former Amalapuram MP G.V. Harsha Kumar on Friday announced his intention to return to the Congress party.

“The fight being staged by Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra seeking justice for the Hathras gang-rape victim vouches for their concern towards the Dalits and tribal people. I am moved by the way Mr. Rahul Gandhi led the fight on Thursday,” Mr. Harsha Kumar told the media here on Friday.

“I have decided to rejoin the Congress party. I have decided it on my own without consulting any of my supporters. I will wait for the response from the party leadership,” said Mr. Harsha Kumar, who quit the Congress after bifurcation of the State.

Mr. Harsha Kumar was elected to the Lok Sabha on Congress party ticket from Amalapuram in 2004 and 2009. Later, he joined the TDP and then the YSRCP.

However, he has not been associated with any political party in the recent months, and is actively involved in the movement against atrocities against Dalits.

Andhra Pradesh is moving towards attaining complete Grama Swaraj, and the village/ward secretariat system is the first step in realising the dream of Mahatma Gandhi, Adviser (Public Affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy has said.

Addressing a gathering of Ministers, MLAs and party workers on the occasion of the 151st birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi at the party central office at Tadepalli near here, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said that the local self governance had become a reality and the setting up of the village/ward secretariats had ushered in a silent revolution.

“All these institutions have been set up in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution. All the institutions in the government are complementary to each other. The yellow media, sponsored by the opposition parties that have been voted out of power by the people, is trying to cast aspersions on the government,” said Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy.

‘Example for others’

Deputy Chief Minister Pushpa Srivani said that the Chief Minister had shown the way to other States by setting up the village/ward secretariats and integrating them into the administration. The door-delivery of pensions and procurement of agricultural produce at the farms itself were a great revolution, she said.

Minister for Agriculture K. Kannababu said that India would never forget the Father of the Nation as well as former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri.

“The concept of local self governance through the village/ward secretariats is now the subject of study in training academies. We have appointed a volunteer for every 50 households,” said Mr. Kannababu.

Activists of the Congress party staged protests in various parts of Nellore district on Friday demanding early grounding of the Dugarajapatnam port.

The activists staged demonstrations in Gudur, Naydupeta, Venkatagiri and Sullurpeta, upset with the undue delay in starting the construction of the port with an investment of ₹8,000 crore promised by the Centre at the time of bifurcation.

Though the port figured in the State Reorganisation Act, the project remained in a limbo all these years as the NDA Government did not take any concrete step to anchor the port cleared by the Manmohan Singh Government, pointed out party Gudur in-charge P. Venkateswarlu.

The State government has ordered a departmental inquiry into the custodial death of a suspect, D. Ajay (30), in Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) police station in the city.

Ajay, who was an eleventh accused in liquor smuggling racket, was brought to the station by the SEB personnel on Thursday. He allegedly collapsed during questioning and died in a private hospital later.

According to sources, the SEB personnel busted an inter-State liquor smuggling racket last month. They seized about 2,000 liquor bottles from an APSRTC cargo vehicle and registered a case.

During investigation, it was revealed that a gang was transporting Non-Duty Paid Liquor (NDPL) from Telangana and supplying the same to some belt shop owners and retailers in AP.

Two RTC employees, who allegedly colluded with the smugglers, were carrying the liquor stocks from the neighbouring State in the cargo vehicle and were unloading the stocks at different points in Krishna, West Godavari and other districts.

Police identified twelve accused in the racket and Ajay, a private driver, was booked for allegedly receiving and distributing the stocks, said SEB Commissioner Vineet Brijlal.

“SEB Director P.H.D. Ramakrishna, who is also the Deputy Inspector-General (DIG) of Police will conduct departmental inquiry into the custodial death. Based on the report, action will be taken against the police, if found guilty,” Mr. Brijlal told The Hindu on Friday.

69,2020/10/02,Caring for a family of 33 furry companions,"The Lingalas have always stood by their dogs, even if it means having to live without electricity and water

Wagging its black and white tail, Shiny likes to reach out for a friendly pat from people passing by.

Sitting next to her is Chintu, who is not too enamoured of humans. He likes his space, and frequently finds himself in the middle of a fight with his furry friends.

Shiny and Chintu are just two of 33 dogs living with Lingala Bhairavi (25), who rescued all of them from the street and now rears them under one roof. For nearly two decades, Bhargavi’s family has been rescuing street dogs, some in a badly bruised state and others as abandoned pups. Some have followed them home and have stayed ever since.

Over the years, Bhargavi along with her parents and two sisters have cared for the dogs as their own family, meticulously keeping a record of each dog’s vaccines and other medical issues.

Sadly, all is not well for Bhargavi and her family as they have been living without water supply and electricity for the past two months.

For the past nine months, they have been looking for a house on rent after Bhargavi’s father Lingala Satyanarayana retired from his job at Visakhapatnam Port Trust. All this while, the family has been staying in the Port quarters provided to Mr. Satyanarayana. However, for the past couple of months, they have been living without power and water supply as they were forced to overstay at the quarters with nobody in the city willing to provide the family a place on rent.

“When we tell people that we have 33 dogs with us, they give us a bewildered look and instantly refuse to give their house on rent. Many have suggested us to hand over the dogs to a shelter home. But how can I abandon them? They are like my children and have become a part of lives now and we cannot think of staying without even one of them,” says Bhargavi, an M.Com student of Andhra University.

There were days when the sisters had to rush one of the dogs to a veterinary hospital late at night because of an emergency. “They reciprocate our love for them in full, maybe even more,” Bhargavi says.

The Lingalas start their day at 4. 30 a.m. daily, when they take the dogs out for a walk. After that, Bhargavi and her sisters spend three hours filling water in large containers from their neighbour’s home.

Financial struggle is another part of their lives. Every month, the family bears an expenditure of ₹25,000 on caring for the dogs.

70,2020/10/02,Theatres gear up to reopen after months of shutdown,"With festive season round the corner, proprietors are hopeful of covering losses

After being closed for over six months due to the pandemic, theatres are gearing up to open up in time for Dasara. Notwithstanding COVID-19 guidelines like filling up only 50% of the total seats, exhibitors are eager to reopen the theatres and get back to business.

“It may take a couple of months for things to settle down, but a majority of proprietors who own one or two theatres are ready to screen the movies as it is still better than having to bear huge maintenance expenses without any income,” said K. Vamsi Kishore, president of Vizag Film Distributors Association.

“We are facing a shortage of content as most of the films are now being screened on OTT platforms. However, film shootings have already begun and some of them will be ready for release soon. When all other sectors have opened up, and flights are operating at full capacity, there is no reason why opening of cinemas should be delayed further,” he said.

“We are spending around ₹5 lakh a month on the maintenance of our three theatres, which have 1,400 seats, even during the shutdown. It may take a couple of months for us to draw audiences after the long gap,” said Mr. Vamsi Kishore.

“Some producers, who had taken many theatres on lease, are not keen on reopening them. They are trying to mislead the government by claiming that there is a risk of the virus spreading further. They are keen on protecting their agreements with OTT platforms and want the opening of the theatres to be delayed by a few more months,” alleged a theatre owner.

“Even without screening films, we are spending ₹1.4 lakh a month on power bills alone. The expenditure on screening of each show is around ₹20,000, taking into account overheads like salaries and power bills,” said Prasad Reddy, manager of Sarat Theatre.

“Apart from leaving seats unoccupied, sanitisation has to be done after each show. Audiences will be willing to buy tickets at a higher cost only if it is a film starring big actors. Many high-budget films are being released on OTT platforms and the small budget films are unlikely to draw many people to the theatres. Though we are getting ready, we plan to wait and watch for some days before deciding to screen films,” Mr. Reddy said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/theatres-gear-up-to-reopen-after-months-of-shutdown/article32748459.ece
71,2020/10/02,When Vizagapatam was at the forefront of astronomy,"Gode Venkata Jaggarow had built an observatory on his private estate in 1840

Very few would know that Vizagapatam (now Visakhapatnam) had forayed into the realm of astronomy way back in 1840.

Gode Venkata Jaggarow, who hailed from a zamindari family, had built an observatory on his private estate in 1840. The estate was located in Dabagardens area. Having an aptitude for mathematics, Mr. Jaggarow was drawn towards the science and mysteries of astronomy, and at the age of 17, he left for Madras (now Chennai) to be tutored in the subject by one Thomas Glanville Taylor from Royal Greenwich Observatory, who was then heading the Madras Observatory.

Mass of Jupiter

While at Madras Observatory, Venkata Jaggarow made many observations and published several papers. One of his papers, in which he arrived at the mass of the planet Jupiter, brought him international fame.

In 1835, using instruments then available to him, he deduced that the mass of Jupiter was 302 times the mass of Earth. His discovery has stood the test of time — latest calculations say that the mass of Jupiter is 318 times that of Earth, only slightly off his estimate.

Venkata Jaggarow returned to Visakhapatnam in 1838 and set up his observatory in 1840 from his own funds to pursue his interest in the subject, says Edward Paul, who has done considerable research on various historical aspects of the city.

He also played an important role in establishing the latitude and longitude of Visakhapatnam. He also built an instrument for measuring rain, the rain gauge (pluviometer). He also procured many scientific instruments for his observatory. He established a flag staff on Dolphin’s Nose to provide timed signals to the ships and to the public. The time flag used to be raised between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and would be hauled down precisely at 9 p.m.

Unfortunately, Venkata Jaggarow died in 1856 at an early age of 39 years, leaving behind his observatory to his only daughter Ankitham Atchayyamma and son-in-law Ankitham Venkata Narsing Row.

Legacy

Inspired by his father-in-law, Narasing Row too became a keen observer of astronomy.

Apart from adding many instruments to the observatory, he continued to provide accurate time signals from the hill, even after the government stopped the service in 1871.

After observing a solar eclipse on August 16, 1868, and the transit of Venus on December 9, 1874 from his observatory, he published his observations.

For his work and observations, Narasing Row was elected Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1870 and Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1872, said Mr. Paul.

After the death of Narasing Row, his wife Atchayyamma took his work forward by supplying meteorological results to the government. She also erected a Celestial Photographic Observatory with a photographic telescope.

It was only in 1898 that the government started its observatory at Waltair.

A few instruments from Mr. Venkata Rao’s observatory can still be seen at the Visakha Museum.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qpx4pz/article32748401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-VZ-VIZAGOBSERVATORY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/when-vizagapatam-was-at-the-forefront-of-astronomy/article32748402.ece
72,2020/10/02,Plasmapheresis machine inaugurated at KGH,"Collector V. Vinay Chand inaugurated a plasmapheresis machine, procured at a cost of ₹22 lakh, at King George Hospital (KGH) here on Thursday.

Mr. Vinay Chand said that the machine would help separate plasma and platelets from the blood collected from donors, and would be utilised in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The plasma required for COVID-19 patients would be supplied by KGH.

“Those who have recovered from COVID-19 can donate their plasma. I appeal to all those who have successfully fought COVID-19 to join the noble cause and come forward to help us in the treatment of COVID-19 patients,” Mr. Vinay Chand said.

Describing the convalescent plasma therapy as an effective treatment option for COVID-19 patients, the Collector said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had announced an incentive of ₹5,000 for plasma donors.

Donating plasma is totally safe and there is no cause for worry, the Collector said.

An additional amount of ₹13 lakh was sanctioned for consumables and ₹10 lakh for other equipment.

74,2020/10/02,"Four persons, one juvenile held for property theft","The Crime Wing of the Visakhapatnam City Police on Thursday arrested four persons and took one juvenile into custody for their alleged involvement in three different property offences.

Addressing a press conference, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crimes) V. Suresh Babu said that in the first case, the IV Town (Crime) police arrested two persons — K. Jagadeesh Babu (20) and K.

75,2020/10/02,Left parties’ protest against Farm Bills enters third day,"Protests being organised by Left parties demanding withdrawal of the Farm Bills brought out by the Centre continued for the third day at the Gandhi statue near the GVMC building here on Thursday.

Addressing the participants, CPI State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy said that the Bills are detrimental to small and marginal farmers who are solely dependent on agriculture for their livelihood.

“The objective of the Centre is to hand over the lands of farmers to big corporates and also to do away with the benefit of Minimum Support Price being extended to farmers,” he alleged.

CPI(M) city secretary B. Ganga Rao said that the Bills were approved in Parliament in an undemocratic manner though the BJP did not have the required strength in the Rajya Saba to the detriment of small and marginal farmers and to benefit corporates. CPI-ML leader Ganesh Panda said that the bills would destroy the country’s food security.

The employees sported black badges in heed to a call given by the All Unions and Associations of BSNL (AUAB), and staged a hunger protest. AUAB convener G.S.N. Raju said that the 20th Foundation Day of BSNL was being organised as a ‘protest day’ to oppose the anti-employee policies of the Centre.

Describing ‘4G spectrum’ as the lifeline of the telecom sector, he said that its non-allocation by the Centre could spell doom for the public sector telecom giant. He warned that if the government does not change its attitude, a strike would be held in November.

77,2020/10/02,"With no syllabi cut, Karnataka universities adopt ‘self-study’ approach","There has been a shift in the manner and style of teaching, one that both teachers and students are adapting to.

While the syllabi for the 2020-21 academic year has been cut for schools and pre-university colleges, universities and colleges have decided against trimming or tweaking their syllabi for the current academic year.

Instead, they are changing their teaching methods and asking students to adopt the “self-study” approach for many chapters. Managements of universities and colleges say they have been forced to do this as there is no clarity on when classes will be allowed to resume. Lecturers say that not only are they unable to complete portions while teaching online, but there has been a shift in the manner and style of teaching, one that both teachers and students are adapting to. Self-study is one such way of learning that is being adopted.

Students, too, say that lecturers are giving them more work to do on their own. A postgraduate student from Christ (Deemed-to-be University) said they have two hours of online classes followed by two hours of self-reading or assignments. “The teachers upload the assignment and give us a deadline. If we submit it in time, we get attendance,” she said.

T.D. Kemparaju, Vice-Chancellor, Bengaluru North University, said universities cannot cut their syllabus arbitrarily and need to do so on a scientific basis after a lot of deliberation. Any change in syllabus will need approval from the University Grants Commission (UGC). “The portion of one semester is related to that in the next, so we cannot just cut it. Instead, we want to encourage students to study some parts of the portion on their own. We want to provide study material that will help them,” he said.

Colleges and universities in the State were initially slated to open on October 1. However, with the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases, the government decided to delay the resumption of classes. This is in keeping with the UGC, which had said that first-semester classes may commence from November 1. S. Japhet, Vice-Chancellor, Bengaluru Central University, said many lecturers are also asking students to make presentations so that the classes are not limited to the lecturers delivering monologues.

Many students, however, are not happy with the online classes and say that lecturers are adopting these methods as they are neither comfortable with taking online classes nor trained in the medium. “We tell our lecturers that they can use certain visual tools to make the classes more lively. However, they are not tech-savvy. To avoid taking classes, they tell us to complete assignments and ask us to study on our own,” said a second-year student of a city-based college affiliated to Bangalore University.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9pbqtl/article32757321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGONLINECLASS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/with-no-syllabi-cut-karnataka-universities-adopt-self-study-approach/article32755254.ece
78,2020/10/02,Heritage bridge across Kapila to be conserved,"It was built in Gothic style and is unique in design as it accommodated metre-gauge railway line parallel to road traffic.

Mysuru division of South Western Railway (SWR) will initiate measures to conserve the bridge across the river Kabini or Kapila at Nanjangud, which is reckoned to be more than 280 years old and is one of the oldest bridges in the country.

The bridge was in existence even before the advent of the Railways and was used by bullock carts, horse carriages, and pedestrians to cross the river. It was constructed in the 1730s by Dalvoy Devaraj, a local chieftain, and a railway track was laid over it when the metre-gauge link connecting Mysuru to Nanjangud was laid and commissioned in 1899.

This engineering marvel was built in Gothic style and is unique in design as it accommodated metre-gauge railway line parallel to road traffic. The bridge measures nearly 225 meters in length and has 56 piers, and the last metre-gauge train that ran over the bridge was on January 17, 2007. After that, it was closed to traffic.

Consequent to the conversion of the railway line to broad gauge, a new bridge was commissioned in 2008 and this vintage structure fell into disuse.

But now, the Mysuru division has decided to conserve the rail-road bridge for posterity, given its heritage status, and plans to restore it at a cost of ₹50 lakh. This entails clearing the bushes and vegetation growth on the structure, plastering damaged piers, paying attention to damaged parapet walls and the road, colour washing the bridge, and illuminating the structure. It will also have signage complete with the history of the structure.

Inspection

Aparna Garg, Divisional Railway Manager, Mysuru, said Indian Railways had a vast heritage and was always in the forefront to take measures to preserve it as it narrates the Railways’ growth in India. In the same spirit, the Mysuru division of SWR is taking proactive measure to preserve the old rail-cum-road bridge across Kapila river.

She conducted an inspection of the heritage structure along with senior divisional engineers on Friday and said a detailed proposal would be prepared to protect the “one of its kind” structure, duly reflecting its old glory. The restoration works will pay attention to the damage inflicted on the structure with age and elements of nature. The aim will be to strengthen the structure without compromising on the heritage facade.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ninpdm/article32755223.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGBRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/heritage-bridge-across-kapila-to-be-conserved/article32755224.ece
79,2020/10/02,Govt. to set up testing labs on PPP model,"The State government has decided to set up COVID-19 testing laboratories on PPP model and a tender process for the same will be completed within a week, said Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar.

Speaking after inaugurating the new COVID-19 testing lab by Eurofins Clinical Genetics India (ECGI) in the city on Friday, the Minister said measures were being taken to increase testing labs by threefold. Further tender would be floated by the Health and Medical Education Department to set up RT-PCR machines in two weeks. Speaking about testing in the State, he said 144 labs had been inaugurated in six months. The lab inaugurated on Friday was expected to conduct up to 5,000 tests a day.

Despite creating awareness about the spread of the COVID-19, the positive cases have been increasing in the state due to lack of awareness on the part of people. Hence, the government has taken strict action by hiking the penalty to Rs 1,000 for not wearing masks at public places in urban areas, Mr Sudhakar said.

He said that though positive cases were on the high in the state, the death rate was under control, at 1.52%.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/govt-to-set-up-testing-labs-on-ppp-model/article32754779.ece
80,2020/10/02,Three women allege they have tested ‘positive’ without being swabbed,"Three women, residents of South Bengaluru, have complained to the BBMP and the police that although they have not been swabbed, they have been informed that they are COVID-19 positive.

The BBMP, meanwhile, has denied the allegation.

Vani M.B., resident of Bommanahalli, along with her relatives Ranjitha and Vidyashree was stopped by a few BBMP personnel near Banashankari Metro Station on September 24, and asked to give swabs for tests. When the women refused, the personnel asked them to give their mobile phone numbers.

“When they showed us their identity cards, we gave them our numbers and immediately got an OTP. They forcibly took the OTP from us. In 10 minutes, we got an SRF Id message that our samples had been collected. After two days, we were shocked when we got a call that we have tested positive,” Ms. Vani told The Hindu.

“We have complained to the BBMP health officials and lodged a complaint in Kumaraswamy Layout police station,” she said.

Disputing the allegations, Munish Moudgil, zonal coordinator for south zone, said: “We have their swabs. They themselves gave their mobile phone numbers. This cannot be fudged by the staff.” He said the samples were drawn near Banashankari Metro Station where 70 to 80 samples are collected daily.

“The health staff on September 24 collected about 65 samples and these three were among that. We will investigate this in detail,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/three-women-allege-they-have-tested-positive-without-being-swabbed/article32754728.ece
81,2020/10/02,COVID-19 | Tests in Karnataka cross 50 lakh,"Experts say that while testing has increased, it is not enough to match velocity of the virus

Karnataka’s COVID-19 tests crossed the 50 lakh mark on Friday even as the test positivity rate (TPR) continued to remain above 10% in at least 15 districts.

From an average 80 tests a day in March, the State is now testing an average of over 80,000 samples a day. On Wednesday, the State tested an unprecedented 94,886 samples, taking the total number of tests to 49,01,083. This number further increased on Friday with 92,059 samples tested following which the total tests touched 50,89,730.

The State ramped up its testing from May onwards. From 2,310 tests in March, the State conducted nearly 16 lakh tests in August. This further went up to nearly 20 lakh tests in September. The tests per million went up from 44,099 on September 1 to 72,541 on September 30.

However, despite the high number of samples tested, experts say the State’s testing is yet to match the velocity of the virus. The State’s TPR on September 30 marginally increased to 12.3% from 11.8% on September 1.

According to epidemiologists, a high TPR indicates that testing is relatively limited to people with high suspicion of COVID-19 and may miss new chains of transmission in the community.

Giridhara R. Babu, member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said increasing TPR indicates that the overall prevalence is on an upward trajectory. “It means the outbreak is expanding further and the State’s testing is not in pace with the spread,” he said. “It is not sufficient to simply increase the numbers. Whom we test and through which test (Rapid Antigen Test, RT-PCR) is as important. The need of the hour is to find people through syndromic approach (those with symptoms, comorbidities and elderly) and test them on priority. This will necessitate that all the RAT negative symptomatic persons will be tested using RT-PCR,” he said.

Shalini Rajneesh, IAS official in charge of testing, said the State’s approach is certainly not on increasing numbers but on focussed testing. “We are testing the symptomatic, ILI, SARI emergency cases, and primary contacts through RAT as they have the highest infection possibility. Other secondary contacts, COVID warriors and super spreaders are tested regularly through RT-PCR,” she said.

Mysore Sanjeev, convener of Project Jeevan Raksha, a public-private partnership which is analysing COVID-19 trends across the country, said in September that the incremental increase in number of testing is 19.8 lakh, a 65% jump over August. This is in line with mega States where the average increase of testing is around 65%. “However, the marginal increase in the TPR in September, indicates that in spite of best efforts of the State, the virus is spreading faster,” he said.

C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer for labs and testing in the State COVID-19 task force, said there is need to further ramp up testing to not just prevent the spread of infection but ensure early intervention in sick patients. “We need to track patients at a moderately symptomatic stage for early admission and treatment. This is the key to reduce mortality,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jepwdj/article32754702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGCOVIDP3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-tests-in-karnataka-cross-50-lakh/article32754704.ece

83,2020/10/02,Ramesh Jarkiholi meets kin of Suresh Angadi,"He accuses D.K. Shivakumar of playing cheap politics over BJP leader’s death

Major and Medium Irrigation Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi met the family members of the late Union Minister Suresh C. Angadi in Belagavi on Friday. He spoke to them for a few minutes, before meeting some of the late leader’s followers outside his house.

He told journalists that he was close to the former minister as he was a senior party colleague. “Mr. Angadi, Jagadish Shettar, and myself made a formidable team of north Karnataka leaders in the party,” he said. “I consider his wife, Mangala, like my sister. We were neighbours and family friends in Gokak. She grew up along with my own sisters,” she said.

He accused Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar of playing cheap politics over the death of the senior leader.

“He [Mr. Shivakumar] is not a leader of any significance to make such statements. He should stop playing such petty politics,” he said.

Earlier, Mr. Shivakumar had claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party had insulted Mr. Angadi’s memory by not bringing his mortal remains to Belagavi.

He told journalists at Sambra airport that the BJP leaders should have allowed shifting the body to Belagavi and permitted his family members and followers to pay their last respects.

“But this was not done. I think that it amounts to betrayal of a senior leader's family,” Mr. Shivakumar added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ramesh-jarkiholi-meets-kin-of-suresh-angadi/article32752640.ece
84,2020/10/02,"Congress lives by ideals of Gandhiji, says Siddaramaiah","‘But BJP idolises Nathuram Godse’

“The Congress lives by the ideals and principles of Mahatma Gandhi. But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has a different hero. Gandhiji’s killer Nathuram Ghodse is their hero and icon,” Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah said in Ghataprabha on Friday.

He was speaking to party cadres and leaders on the occasion of Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri Jayanti at the N.S. Hardikar Seva Dal training academy set up in Ghataprabha.

“Dividing society on communal lines and fostering hatred between Hindus and Muslims is the BJP’s only job. They have no positive agenda, nor any plans for all-round development. They are waiting to divide the society at every opportunity,” he said.

He urged the cadre to imbibe the party’s values of inclusive development and ‘sarvodaya’.

“There is no point is just wearing the party’s caps and badges, without attuning yourself to the party’s values,” he said.

The BJP was appropriating leaders of the Congress and other freedom fighters as none of its leaders had participated in the Independence struggle, Mr. Siddaramaiah said.

“Though the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was founded in 1925, its leaders were busy in communal politics and did not participate in the freedom struggle. The Jan Sangh was founded in 1950 and the BJP was started in 1980. That is why they end up using pictures of leaders who are not from their party,” he said.

Earlier, while speaking to journalists, Mr. Siddaramaiah refused to react to BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel’s allegation that Congress leaders had divided the society on the lines of the British, saying Mr. Kateel was too insignificant a leader to deserve a response.

Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar urged Congress workers to motivate farmers to write letters against the farm Acts passed by the Parliament.

“AICC president Sonia Gandhi has said she would carry all the letters to President Ram Nath Kovind. We need to oppose these anti–farmer laws strongly,” he said.

He said that he was very happy to be involved in the task of strengthening the Seva Dal, as it would help build the party’s cadre and to “take on the persistent efforts by the BJP to spread fake news against the party and its ideology”.

There are three Seva Dal training centres in the State, in Belagavi, Udupi, and Bengaluru, and a fourth one would be set up. He said he would release ₹3 crore for the Ghataprabha academy.

He said that despite the BJP’s money and muscle power and efforts by the IT cell to brainwash people, the Congress maintained significant influence on the people.

“Over 1.4 crore people have watched my swearing in as the KPCC president on social media. I am letting you know that we have a strong base in Karnataka,” he said.

KPCC working president Eshwar Khandre said that his exposure to Seva Dal activities had forced him to stay back in India and work for the people, after his engineering degree. “After my degree, I had planned to go overseas. But I attended a Seva Dal camp which changed my mind. I decided to enter active politics,” he said.

He said he would urge senior leaders to make Seva Dal training compulsory for those who want to enter the Congress. He said that democratic values of the country would be strengthened if the Congress was voted back to power.

Satish Jarkiholi said he had sought the responsibility of training the party cadres from the party leaders as he wanted to take up the task seriously. He said that the Ghataprabha Seva Dal academy would not only train cadre in grass roots organisation, but also in use of modern technology.

Seva Dal leader B.K. Hariprasad alleged that the BJP was trying to change the Constitution and take away all the liberties offered by it, and urged the cadre to fight against the BJP.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-lives-by-ideals-of-gandhiji-says-siddaramaiah/article32752458.ece

The programme was inaugurated by Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Health and Family Welfare, at a function here on Friday. Deputy Commissioners and zilla pancahayat CEOs also launched the programme in their respective districts through a videoconference.

Mr. Akhtar said that sanitation campaigns would improve the health of rural populations, save lost man-days on account of ill health, bring savings on health expenditure for families, and give protection from COVID-19 by way of increased awareness about sanitation and good hygiene.

Large and Medium Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar has said that Hubballi-Dharwad will be developed as a fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) cluster for South India, generating an annual turnover of over ₹25,000 crore.

Mr. Shettar received a vision document, ‘Transform Hubbali-Dharwad: Vision 2020-2025’, from Ullas Kamath, Joint Managing Director of Jyothy Labs Ltd. and Chairman of the FMCG Vision Group, and said the cluster was being actively pursued by the government to attract investments and generate large-scale employment in the north Karnataka region. The government had announced the project in the last budget.

It would generate five lakh direct and indirect job opportunities, through the associated service industry such as transport, premium hotels, restaurants,” Mr. Shettar said.

The Hubli-Dharwad region was identified suiting the development needs, given its connectivity with the consumer markets of Bengaluru, Belagavi, Hyderabad, Pune, and Mumbai. The cluster seeks to change the social demographics of the Hubballi- Dharwad region by developing industrial and allied economic activities, he said.

In tune with the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ concept, Hubballi-Dharwad would be the flag-bearer for the next industrial growth in Karnataka. The FMCG cluster development would be proposed in three phases, with each phase comprising investment of ₹2,500 crore from 50 FMCG companies (an average investment of ₹50 crore each). Each phase would generate 50,000 jobs, with 50% jobs reserved for women. Each phase is expected to occupy an area of around 500 acres, Mr. Kamath said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yp15y3/article32752320.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02hubli-document,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fmcg-cluster-in-hubballi-dharwad-to-generate-five-lakh-jobs/article32752297.ece

“Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has failed to stop the rising atrocities on women and Dalits. He should resign immediately,” he said. He was speaking to journalists in Sambra airport when he arrived to open the Congress Bhavan in the city.

“UP police are behaving in a dictatorial manner. It seems as if the laws and rules of the country do not apply in UP. Women, minorities, Dalits and backward classes are not safe there,” he said.

“It is a literal jungle raj out there,” he added. “We don’t know if Mr Adityanath is a Yogi, Bhogi or a Rogi.”

He took serious objections to the UP police allegedly pushing around Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and trying to stop him from meeting the rape and murder victim’s family in Hathras.

“Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were not going to cause any problems to anyone. But the UP police stopped them. That is because they don’t want the people to know the failures of UP police,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.

He alleged that CM B.S Yeddiyurappa’s family members were involved in large scale financial irregularities in COVID-19 management. “They have procured material for double the price and violated rules of procurement,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bjp-has-lost-moral-right-to-rule-up-siddaramaiah/article32751141.ece

Briefing reporters after the core committee meeting on Thursday, BJP MLA Arvind Limbavali only said that the core committee recommended names of candidates for the Assembly constituencies that are going for the bypolls and for the Council seats for which elections are scheduled. But he desisted from disclosing the names and said it was the prerogative of the central election committee to take a final call.

According to sources, the State core committee has recommended the names of Munirathna, who quit his Assembly membership won on the Congress ticket and joined the BJP, and its own leader Tulasi Muniraju Gowda, who had unsuccessfully contested the previous Assembly polls in Rajarajeshwarinagar constituency. BJP circles are curious if the party high command would consider Mr. Munirathna or give importance to leader from its own cadre.

The party has recommended the names of three candidates — S.R. Gowda, B.K. Manujunath, and Rajesh Gowda — for the bypolls to Sira constituency, sources said.

However, the core committee is learnt to have recommended the names of single candidates for the biennial elections to four Council seats. They are — Puttanna (Bengaluru Teachers), Chidananda (South-east Graduates), S.V. Sankanuru (West Graduates), and Sashil Namoshi (North-east Teachers).

92,2020/10/02,Coronavirus | Kerala promulgates Ordinance to allow COVID-19 patients vote through postal ballots,"COVID-19 patients and those quarantined in Kerala can exercise their franchise through postal votes in the forthcoming elections to local bodies. The voting time has also been increased and the polling stations will remain open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. for the voters to exercise their franchise.

The sweeping changes to allow postal ballots and increasing the voting time had been made through the Kerala Panchayat Raj (Second Amendment) Ordinance 2020 promulgated by the Governor, Arif Mohammed Khan based on the recommendations made by the Cabinet last month.

The ordinance, that amends temporarily the Kerala Panchayati Raj Act 1994, has come into effect. Amendments had been made to Section 70 of the Principal Act for increasing the voting time by one hour from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. and a new section inserted after Section 74 to allow postal ballot to those affected by the pandemic and quarantined.

The Cabinet decision was based on the proposal of the State Election Commission to the government to allow postal ballots or proxy votes for COVID-19 patients and those in quarantine. However, there was stiff opposition from the major political parties in the State to the proxy voting.

The elections are for 15,962 wards in 941 Grama Panchayats, 2,080 wards in 152 Block panchayats, 331 wards in 14 District Panchayats, 3,078 wards in 86 Municipalities and 414 wards in the six Municipal Corporations.

Training had already been provided to the master trainers by the State Election Commission. These master trainers will impart training to other officials. First level checking of the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) will commence soon as the officials from Hyderabad have reached all the districts and are in quarantine as per COVID-19 protocol. Draw of lots of reservation wards is on.

93,2020/10/02,Sloth bear that wandered close to human habitations captured in Thiruvananthapuram,"The Forest department successfully trapped a female sloth bear that had strayed into a rubber plantation near Varkala early Friday. The presence of the animal in areas close to the Thiruvananthapuram-Kollam border has kept the region in the grip of fear for around three months.

Luring her with a honey comb, the bear, estimated to be around 8 years old, was caught in a trap cage that was planted in Palavacode near Pallickal by around 4 a.m. The cage had been set in the plantation on Thursday evening after repeated sightings on the animal had been reported in the area for the last four days.

Listed in the Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, the sloth bear was captured with permission of the Chief Wildlife Warden following numerous complaints that cropped up from several places including Kulathupuzha and Chathannoor in Kollam. During the last few days, the animal was spotted in Navaikulam and Pallickal in Thiruvananthapuram. While forest officials initially considered the possibility of mischief, sightings of pug marks confirmed the presence of a bear in the region.

“While sloth bears are generally found in interior forests, the circumstances that led the animal to wander close to human habitations are yet to be ascertained,” K.I. Pradeep Kumar, Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Thiruvananthapuram, said.

Following its capture, the animal was shifted to the Palode forest range office amid the frantic attempts it made to escape. A veterinary doctor soon examined the bear and certified the animal as healthy. The bear will soon be released into its natural habitat in AchenkovilThe department has decided to release the bear into its natural habitat in the Achenkovil forest range.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/95tt9y/article32752008.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201002-WA0058jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sloth-bear-that-wanders-close-to-human-habitations-captured-in-thiruvananthapuram/article32751988.ece
94,2020/10/02,Ramesh Chennithala denies he accepted expensive mobile phone from smuggling case accused,"Politicians from the ruling front had attempted to cast Mr. Chennithala under the spotlight after a private builder said in a court filing in Ernakulam recently that he had purchased five cell phones at the behest of Swapna Suresh in 2019.

Thiruvananthapuram Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Friday denied that he had received an expensive mobile phone as a gift from Swapna Suresh, the second accused in the high-profile case relating to the smuggling of gold in bulk via air cargo consignments addressed to officials at the UAE consulate here.

Politicians from the ruling front had attempted to cast Mr. Chennithala under the spotlight after a private builder said in a court filing in Ernakulam recently that he had purchased five cell phones at the behest of Swapna in 2019.

She had purportedly told the builder that UAE consulate would make a present of the devices to dignitaries attending an Iftar party hosted by the diplomatic mission in December that year.

Mr. Chennithala was one of the invitees. At the time, Swapna was a consulate employee who often officiated as the master of ceremonies at events organised by the diplomatic mission.

Mr Chennithala said he remembered having attended the Iftar function. The organisers had welcomed him with a shawl, which he gave away immediately. He had not accepted any gift though there was a raffle for attendees.

The ruling front had raised the allegation to divert public attention from its wrongdoings. Mr Chennithala said he would legally challenge the builder's submission in court.

Bribe component

The issue had become a subject of heated political debate in Kerala after some quarters claimed that the mobile phones were a minor component of the substantial bribe the builder had allegedly paid Swapna and other intermediaries to bag the UAE consulate's contract to construct 140 dwellings for the poor in Thrissur via Life Mission, the flagship programme of the Kerala government to provide free housing for the poor.

The UAE Red Crescent had offered to underwrite the project through the country's diplomatic mission in Thiruvananthapuram.

The contract came under a cloud after the CBI opened an investigation against Life Mission and the builder on the charge of violating the provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act based on a complaint filed by Congress leader Anik Ankara, MLA.

MLA's charge

Mr Ankara had alleged that the builder and a private consultancy, with the tacit approval of Life Mission, had accepted aid from a foreign charity illegally. The respondents gave away a portion of the foreign aid as a bribe to persons who facilitated the agreement, he had alleged.

Govt. opposes CBI

The CBI case provoked the government to challenge the agency in the High Court. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Thursday that the CBI had intervened with the federal system. The agency's case against Life Mission was untenable. The State agency was only a facilitator. The contract was between the UAE consulate and the builder. The government was not a party to their transactions.

A meeting of the organisation held at Sulthan Bathery on Wednesday urged Forest officials to stop misleading propaganda regarding the issue. The officials misled the public even in a recent pamphlet which was published to sensitise the public to the issue, Thomas Manakkunnel, chairman of the organisation, said.

Similar propaganda was made by the Forest department officials in Tamil Nadu while declaring such zones in the neighbouring Nilgiris district. But the lives of the people in Gudalur and Pandalur taluks of Nilgiris district had become miserable after the declaration of the zones there, Mr. Thomas said.

107,2020/10/02,‘Nishabdham’ movie review: A thriller that engages partially,"Anushka Shetty, R Madhavan and Anjali have their moments but ‘Nishabdham’ barely scratches the surface of a potentially engrossing story

Nishabdham (Silence in Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi), streaming on Amazon Prime Video, is a Telugu film in which the silence could have been used better. It has a protagonist with hearing and speech impairment — painter Sakshi (Anushka Shetty) who converses with sign language and uses her mobile phone text-to-voice converter to good effect. As though to counter this, the investigative police officer Mahalakshmi (Anjali) doubles up as the sutradhar (narrator) and many a time, is made to over-simply things for viewers.

Director Hemanth Madhukar has at his disposal a talented ensemble cast — R Madhavan as the millionaire cello player Antony Gonsalves, Michael Madsen as police officer Richard Dawkins (though others refer to him inconsistently as Richard Dickens in the film), Shalini Pandey as Sonali, Subbaraju as Vivek and Srinivas Avasarala as Chandru, Maha’s pillar of support. The story happens in Seattle, USA, and the film might have managed to cut through language barriers in India as well as appeal to the global audience, if only it had a far more intriguing plot, screenplay and better-written characters.

Nishabdham Cast: Anushka Shetty, R Madhavan, Anjali and Shalini Pandey

Direction: Hemanth Madhukar

Music: Gopi Sundar, Girishh Gopalakrishnan

Streaming on: Amazon Prime Video

On a holiday post their engagement, Antony and Sakshi stop by a haunted house to find a painting. A sudden turn of events makes the house a scene of the crime, after nearly 47 years. Meanwhile, there have been cases of missing young women, including Sakshi’s friend Sonali.

Shaneil Deo’s camera and Girishh Gopalakrishnan’s background score subtly and effectively amplify the mood of the thriller, using a less-is-more approach. The songs composed by Gopi Sundar are good too but one of them feels out of place, cropping up at a crucial point in the thriller.

As we warm up to the characters and plot points, a few things feel amiss. Some characters are painted in broad strokes that it becomes easy to guess an ulterior motive.

Some segments work well — like the fleeting moments in the beginning when the director wants us to ‘hear’ the world from Sakshi’s perspective, or Antony teaching her to play the cello by paying heed to the reverberation of the notes. However, this aesthetic film with able actors left me cold when the big reveal happens.

The manner in which the big reveal happens is a huge letdown. For all the work that Maha is shown to do, she’s conveniently forgotten and we get answers to the ‘who’ and ‘why’ through someone else as a long flashback, out of the blue.

The actors try to work with the given material. Anushka has that arresting screen presence and emotes well, as though words don’t matter much. Madhavan is saddled with a character that could have had more depth, but he still pulls it off. Shalini makes her presence felt in a role that warrants her to be little else than a grumpy, over-possessive friend. Subbaraju gets his moments to shine and I wish it had been the case with Srinivas Avasarala too, who is underutilised. But then, that can also be said of Michael Madsen who is cast in a unidimensional role as an obnoxious cop. Anjali is good; if only the story and screenplay had allowed her to get to the bottom of the puzzle, this would have been a different film, and she too would have had more scope.

And, oh, whatever happened to the mystery of the ghost, with which the film begins. The glaring missteps make Nishabdham underwhelming.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/41oy33/article32750830.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Nishabdham-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nishabdham-review-an-underwhelming-thriller/article32750831.ece
108,2020/10/02,"Tangedco to get over ₹30,000 crore under Centre’s bailout package","The package is meant to help entities such as the Tangedco clear their dues to Central generation and transmission companies, independent power producers and renewable energy generators

The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco), known for suffering from chronic financial crunches, has been sanctioned ₹30,230.3 crore under the Central government’s COVID-19 liquidity infusion scheme in the light of the pandemic.

Officially called “special long term transition loan to DISCOMs [Distribution Companies],” the bailout package is meant to help entities such as the Tangedco clear their dues to Central generation and transmission companies, independent power producers and renewable energy generators.

A few months ago, the Tangedco sent to the Centre, a revised application for ₹32,682.65 crore against its original request for ₹18,000 crore. This was in response to the Centre’s decision to extend the scheme’s reference date from March 31 to June 30.

The loan will be provided by two Central agencies – REC Limited (formerly Rural Electrification Corporation Limited) and the Power Finance Corporation (PFC). The former will give ₹17,830.3 crore including ₹2,715.15 crore, which pertains to a portion of the PFC’s component of the overall sanctioned loan amount. The remaining ₹12,400 crore will come from the PFC, which is also expected to follow suit shortly.

A communication to this effect was sent on Thursday by Sanjay Kulshrestha, Chief General Manager (State Operations) of the REC Limited to his company’s Chennai office, a copy of which is available with The Hindu. The State government too, was immediately informed of the decision.

Initially, 50% of the sanctioned amount will be released by the two institutions as part of the first tranche. One of the pre-commitment conditions is that a tariff revision petition would have to be filed before the disbursement of the second tranche. Digital payment of power bills, self-assessment by consumers and installation of pre-paid meters at government offices are among other conditions.

According to the Central government, the package marks a “one-time permission” to two of its agencies to lend money for working capital above the ceiling of 25% of the previous year’s revenue of the utility concerned. After extending the reference date, the Centre also increased the size of the liquidity infusion package from ₹ 90,000 crore to ₹ 1.2 lakh crore.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/wk07il/article32752248.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02OCTTH--POWER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tangedco-to-get-over-30000-crore-under-centres-bailout-package/article32752250.ece
109,2020/10/02,We are opposing the Acts for the welfare of farmers: Duraimurugan,"He cited the example of BSNL saying many have gone for private telecom players bringing the government-run telecom company to the brink of closure

VELLORE

We are not opposing the farm Act for political reasons, but for the welfare of the farmers, said S. Duraimurugan, DMK general secretary on Friday.

He was addressing the people during a gram sabha meeting organised by the DMK members in Vandranthangal near Katpadi. “Now private traders will start purchasing it from the farmers at a higher price and gradually no one will sell it to the government run marketing committees leading to its closure. After this the private traders will start quoting cheap prices and farmers will have no other option but to sell it to them,” he said citing an example of how many left BSNL for private telecom players and brought the government-run telecom company to the brink of closure.

He said that even Uzhavar Sandhai (farmer market) will also cease to exist. “There are many such flaws in the Act. When the DMK was in power we procured rice from farmers for ₹1,840 per quintal. In Kerala the rate is ₹2,500 per quintal, a small State like Chhattisgarh gives ₹ 2,650 and Delhi, where rice production is less, the rate is ₹ 2,620. But today in Tamil Nadu, there is nothing for farmers,” he claimed adding that many farmers had met him and submitted petitions requesting to scrap the Farm Act.

Few villages in Vellore, Tirupathur, Ranipet and Tiruvannamalai district, led by DMK members, conducted the Gram Sabha meetings on Friday and took resolution against the Farm Act.

“We just know that the act is harmful to the farmers. Based on the directions of our DMK president M.K. Stalin, we held meetings with personal distancing norms and passed a resolution against the Act,” said D.

In a separate statement, Mr. Balakrishnan strongly condemned Tamil Nadu government's decision to cancel grama sabha meetings. The state government has cancelled the protest fearing that the grama sabhas would pass resolutions against the recently enacted farm laws, he alleged.

Mr. Balakrishnan also noted that grama sabha meetings were supposed to bring up the issue of recent scams in housing and other schemes and alleged that the state government cancelled the meetings after coming to know about this.

114,2020/10/02,"‘In 10 years, joint families may return’","When that happens, disease may not be a burden, says geriatrician

Everything comes full circle, they say. It is the same for the joint family system, according to geriatrician V.S. Natarajan.

In the last 40 years since he set up geriatrics specialty in the Madras Medical College, he has seen many changes — from people dying of infectious diseases to the elderly becoming dependent on their families because of the disability caused by non-communicable diseases.

Dr. Natarajan says, “When I started the geriatric ward in GH in the 1980s, people suffered from chest infection, scabies and leprosy that were easy to treat. Now, we see people with diabetes, stroke and dementia. At that time, physicians used to go to the patients’ house.” With no family planning and a robust joint family system, the elderly received care from other family members. Medical advancement in the last 40 years has meant the death rate, which was over 25% in 1950, will be reduced to 7.5% in 2023.

Longevity may have increased but the elders have to face three Ds — disease, disability and dependence. A diabetic becomes dependent owing to retinopathy; mild Parkinson’s disease progresses, leading to dependence five years later.

The next decade spells a better future for geriatricians as the lifespan of the population increases. The government must gear up to provide services to the elders. “We started the Institute of Geriatrics with two postgraduate students. Now, we have nine PGs. The government can use these specialists in district headquarters hospitals and for house call programmes for the elderly. This would help to treat chronic diseases,” he says. The house call programme he launched in 2008 has treated over 10,000 elderly and saved many lives.

Dr. Natarajan has been organising awareness programmes in schools on elder abuse. More homes for the aged in rural areas and offering free vaccination to the elders at primary health centres are the way forward because in the next 25 years every fifth person would be elderly.

He wants the old age pension expanded to cover daily wagers. The pension amount must be increased to ₹3,000, he says.

The demographic change could also bring about some changes, such as elderly marriages. More elderly women and widows would be working. Men are prone to vascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke, besides accidents, unlike women, who are protected by their hormones.

Another welcome change could be the return of the joint family due to work compulsions. “When that happens, disease may not be a burden,” he says.

Thursday was observed as the International Day of Older Persons.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/in-10-years-joint-families-may-return/article32748616.ece
115,2020/10/02,State witnesses shortfall in realisation of Cauvery water share,"Against prescribed 123.14 tmc ft during southwest monsoon, T.N. got 120.24 tmc ft

After two successive years of excess realisation of its share of Cauvery water during the crucial southwest monsoon (June-September), Tamil Nadu has ended this year’s season with a deficit.

Against a prescribed quantity of 123.14 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) for the period, the State got 120.24 tmc ft, marking a shortfall of 2.895 tmc ft. What is significant is that at the beginning of September, the cumulative shortfall for the season was around 11.3 tmc ft, which has come down since.

Of the total quantity received this year, about 103 tmc ft was realised by the State in August and September.

A significant pattern

A perusal of data on the inflow of Cauvery river water in the last 10 years reveals a striking feature, which has been a pattern for the last 30 years. In six of the last 10 years, the State got less than its share of Cauvery water. Since 1991, there have been 19 such years when Tamil Nadu realised less than its share of water during June-September, as stipulated by the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal in its interim (1991) and final (2007) orders and by the Supreme Court in February 2018.

According to the tribunal’s interim order, of an overall annual quantity of 205 tmc ft, 137 tmc ft was to be received by Tamil Nadu during June-September. In the tribunal’s final order, the figure was 134 tmc ft and in the Supreme Court’s judgment, 123.14 tmc ft.

As on Thursday morning, the water level in the Mettur dam stood at 96.64 ft (full level- 120 ft), with its storage being 60.573 tmc ft (capacity- 93.47 tmc ft). Inflow to the dam was 8,343 cubic feet per second (cusecs) and the discharge 6,850 cusecs, including 6,000 cusecs through the river.

What is of additional comfort to the State is that the Bhavanisagar dam, also in the Cauvery basin, is close to the brim with a storage of around 30 tmc ft, against a capacity of 32.8 tmc ft.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5kbb6g/article32748614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02Cauverycol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/state-witnesses-shortfall-in-realisation-of-cauvery-water-share/article32748615.ece

117,2020/10/02,"Amid lockdown, KMC registers a rise in births","800 deliveries were performed at Chennai hospital in Sept.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of deliveries performed at the Government Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) Hospital has been on the rise. On September 29 alone, a total of 40 babies were delivered at the hospital, as against a daily average of 20-25.

COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown led to an increased inflow of pregnant women to government hospitals. KMC, a government hospital in Chennai offering maternity services, has seen more deliveries amid the pandemic.

Covid-19 patients too

“Usually, we conduct 450-500 deliveries a month at the hospital, and at times, the number goes up to 700-750. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of deliveries has been on the rise. This is because many patients opted for deliveries at government hospitals. Our obstetrics-gynaecology team has been working throughout, handling pregnant women, including those who have tested positive for COVID-19,” P. Vasanthamani, dean of KMC, said.

According to data available at the hospital, 432 deliveries were conducted in March. The number of deliveries increased to 601 in April and 649 in May.

There were 684 deliveries in June, 642 in July and 659 in August. In September, 800 deliveries were conducted at the hospital.

Till date, 513 antenatal women, who tested positive for COVID-19, were admitted to the hospital. Of this, 306 women gave birth, while the remaining were discharged after treatment.

“We had two pregnant women — aged 28 and 30 — who were critical. Both had central placenta previa in which the placenta covers the internal os of the cervix, and had tested positive for COVID-19. The condition could lead to complications, including excessive bleeding warranting blood transfusion, and even a hysterectomy. Doctors performed caesarean sections and both patients recovered well and were discharged,” she said.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M) are collaborating with their counterparts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to find ways to use industrial and agricultural by-products.

A major byproduct, biomass ash, is not put to full use due to its complex physio-chemical characteristics. One of the aims of the project is to develop novel building materials that cost less and have a low impact on the environment, compared to the existing materials. Piyush Chaunsali and Ravindra Gettu, professors from the Department of Civil Engineering, along with Elsa A. Olivetti, Atlantic Richfield associate professor of energy studies at MIT, are conducting the research. The project has been taken up under the SPARC initiative of the Union Ministry of Education.

According to Mr. Chaunsali, the unique aspect of the project is its aim to develop a novel framework for high-volume use of industrial by-products in alternative cementitious binders.

Byproducts, such as biomass ash, coal ash, red mud and copper slag, generated in large volumes, could have applications in the construction of roads, buildings and bridges.

Ms. Olivetti said cement concretes were among the most widely used materials, and, hence, have a big impact on the environment.

The researchers are looking at how waste materials available in various regions of India can be reused to reduce their environmental footprint.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/7vb8mq/article32748552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th02iit,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/researchers-collaborate-to-use-industrial-agri-byproducts/article32748554.ece

123,2020/10/02,Former Indian Bank MD M. Gopalakrishnan dies,"He was a popular as well as controversial figure

Former chairman-cum-managing director of Indian Bank M. Gopalakrishnan died owing to ill-health at a private hospital here on Wednesday night. In the 1990s, he was a popular figure and was in the news often.

Mr. Gopalakrishnan, 86, is survived by his wife Rajalakshmi and daughter Sakila. He was born in 1935 into a traditional family with an agricultural background at Koladi near Thiruverkadu. His father M. Radhakrishna Pillai had served as Mayor of Madras during 1944-45 and introduced several reforms.

Mr. Gopalakrishnan joined Indian Bank as an unpaid officer in 1958. He went on to become its CMD in 1988 and continued in the post till December 1995.

Bank officials and his colleagues said he was a visionary and proactive. Under him, agriculture, education and healthcare and services became priority areas for the bank.

He was a pioneer in supporting start-ups, many of which became major successes.

The bank supported many philanthropic causes during his tenure.

Mr. Gopalakrishnan’s career was also marked by controversies as he got seven extensions — unprecedented in the banking history — when P.V. Narasimha Rao was the Prime Minister and Manmohan Singh was the Union Finance Minister. When he was CMD, Indian Bank extended loans to several people, including those who were close to politicians.

A senior business journalist recalled, “He was generous to everyone who sought loans. He was always the chief guest at any inauguration or launch and became more popular. Loans were extended to educational institutions, healthcare facilities and film personalities who started new ventures, besides people who were close to politicians. Some of them were done on oral orders. Under his tenure, many autorickshaw drivers in the city had benefited from the loans from the bank.”

After Mr. Gopalakrishnan demitted office in 1995, Indian Bank reported a loss of ₹1,336 crore that financial year. He was arrested by the CBI on October 25, 1996, on the charge of sanctioning huge amounts to individuals accused and their companies without sufficient securities and by flouting the bank rules. The CBI filed 18 cases against him and his subordinates in 1998. So far, he had been convicted in 5 cases from 2009 and acquitted in one. He was given a 14-year jail term and a one-year term. Appeals have been pending against the convictions in higher courts. The rest of the cases are still under trial in lower courts.

Mr. Gopalakrishnan also dabbled in politics. He joined the Tamil Manila Congress, led by late G.K. Moopanar.

He was also the nominee of Makkal Tamil Desam, led by former Minister S. Kannappan, in Bhuvanagiri in 2001. He later joined the AIADMK. He also served as president of the Tamilnadu Yadava Maha Sabha.

His body was cremated at Besant Nagar.

PMK founder S. Ramadoss and Congress MP Su. Thirunavukkarasar expressed their condolences.

In his message, PMK founder S. Ramadoss said Gopalakrishnan worked for the development of the Yadava community and backed various movements organised by the PMK to ensure social justice and ban liquor sales.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/former-indian-bank-md-m-gopalakrishnan-dies/article32748549.ece
124,2020/10/02,State GST collections up 15% in Sept.,"Positive growth recorded first time after the lockdown

Tamil Nadu’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections rose by 15% to ₹6,454 crore in September 2020 from ₹5,616 crore in September 2019, data released by the Union Finance Ministry on Thursday showed.

The GST collections rose for the first time after the COVID-19 lockdown imposed in March. More relaxations were granted in the State for commercial activities in September.

The collections declined 24% to ₹4,635 crore in July 2020 as against ₹6,084 crore in July 2019. In June, the collections declined 15% to ₹4,976 crore from ₹5,881 crore in June 2019.

In August 2020, it had declined 12% to ₹5,243 crore from ₹5,943 crore in August 2019.

One of the key issues has been Centre providing GST compensation to States.

Tamil Nadu rejected the Centre’s proposal on GST compensation and stated that the Government of India had a moral and legal obligation to pay the compensation for the shortfall in GST collections. The GST compensation due for Tamil Nadu was ₹11,269 crore for FY 2020-21 (April - July).",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/state-gst-collections-up-15-in-sept/article32748541.ece

In his complaint, K. Balasubramaniyan said he, along with his wife, had jointly purchased an apartment in “Tulive Viha” at Anna Nagar East from G.K.S. Technology Park Pvt. Ltd in 2019. He objected to the sale of a part of the alleged common area to two other home buyers Devendra Bhatia and Anjula Bhatia.

The complainant named the builder and the other home buyers as respondents. Mr. Bhatia and Ms. Bhatia challenged the maintainability of the complaint on the grounds that he had no locus standi since the association of the buyers (Tulive Viha Apartment Owners Association) had been formed and it was the association which had to resolve the disputes with the promoter. The TNRERA rejected the plea, noting that the respondents had misconstrued the explanation to Section 31(1) of the RERA Act. As per the section, any aggrieved person may file a complaint for any violation or contravention of the provisions of the Act, it said. The definition of person includes the association members in addition to the individual buyers, it said.

The authority reiterated that once the Act was in place, recourse could be taken through arbitration and rejected the plea on that ground as well and ruled that the complaint was maintainable.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tnrera-rejects-plea-that-association-can-resolve-dispute-with-builder/article32748259.ece

Puducherry’s COVID-19 case tally crossed 28,000, as 489 more persons tested positive for the infection on Thursday, even as four more fatalities took the Union Territory’s toll to 525.

All deaths were recorded in the capital, and included that of former Director of Medical Services D. Carounanidy. The deceased, including a woman, had co-morbidities and were in the 53-83 age group. The case fatality rate stood at 1.87% and recovery rate at 80.31%.

“A further relaxation in restrictions by the Government of India makes it all the more imperative that people wear masks and comply with physical distancing norms,” Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao said. He has also asked the Education Department to supply a pair of masks to each government school student.

The new cases were reported after testing 5,153 samples, indicating a positivity rate of 9.48%.

134,2020/10/02,ASI’s new circle comes into being in Tiruchi,"Formed to improve management of monuments, it will have jurisdiction over 20 central and southern districts of the State

A new administrative circle of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), with jurisdiction over 20 central and southern districts of the State, came into existence in Tiruchi on Thursday.

The Tiruchi Circle, created by bifurcating the ASI’s Chennai Circle, will have 162 monuments and sites under its control.

It is one of the seven new circles of the ASI created across the country to improve management of monuments by the Union Ministry of Culture.

The erstwhile office of the Tiruchi Sub-Circle, situated right behind the Mainguard Gate, a heritage monument, will function as the Circle office temporarily. T. Arun Raj, who took charge as the first Superintending Archaeologist of the circle, said a more spacious building for the circle would be identified soon in consultation with the district administration.

Speaking to The Hindu, Dr. Raj said the circle would get more officers, including technical staff, in the near future, in proportion to the number of monuments and sites under its control. “While preserving world heritage monuments, such as the Brihadeesvara temple at Thanjavur, will be the priority, importance would also be given to protect lesser known monuments, especially in Pudukottai, Thanjavur and Tirunelveli districts. Loose sculptures would be strengthened, fenced and documented,” he said.

Dr. Raj said that he would soon write to the Collectors and police officers in the districts under his jurisdiction on the importance of protecting heritage structures and preventing encroachments.

He would strive to revive the district level heritage committees, with enthusiasts and officials as members, to take up initiatives to safeguard unprotected monuments.

App to be developed

He also plans to develop an app wherein local residents can upload pictures of sculptures and idols of lesser known sites and temples so that they serve as a repository of digital records.

It could help prevent theft of idols and in easy identification/tracing in case of thefts.

Earlier, speaking at a brief ceremony, Dr. Raj underlined the need to protect monuments and heritage structures, some of which are being gradually lost, by involving local communities. “We will try to raise awareness on the importance of protecting heritage structures and sites through various programmes,” he said. The scope for roping in local industries in conservation efforts under public-private partnership mode would also be explored,he added.

135,2020/10/02,High Court laments increasing incidents of rape being reported in the country,"It asks IGP (West Zone) to monitor probe into Palladam incident

The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the Inspector General of Police (West Zone) to monitor the investigation into allegations of a 22-year-old migrant labourer having been gang-raped at Palladam in Tiruppur district.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugam issued the direction following an application moved by advocate A.P. Suryaprakasam who also sought provision of food, shelter, medical aid and monetary compensation to the survivor.

Referring to the recent Hathras gang-rape incident in Uttar Pradesh and other similar crimes, the senior judge in the Division Bench expressed anguish over many incidents of rape and gang-rape being reported in the “spiritual land.”

The judge referred to a study, which claimed that the statistics were so alarming that it accounted to one woman or girl getting raped in the country every 15 minutes, and said: “It is very unfortunate. There’s no security for women.”

The sub-application seeking assistance to the Palladam rape survivor was filed in a habeas corpus petition that was already pending in the court. In the HCP, the court had sought details regarding the protection provided to migrant labourers by the Centre and the State government.

After Justice Velmurugan insisted that the State government should ensure that migrant labourers do not get exploited by employers, the Bench passed an order directing the government to disclose steps taken in that direction.

Mr. Suryaprakasam told the court that, apart from numerous problems such as meagre pay and lack of access to even basic amenities, women migrant labourers also end up being easy targets for “sexual predators” who indulge in brutal acts.

Finding force in his submission, the judges directed the police to ensure that the culprits in the Palladam rape case were brought to book. They also ordered payment of compensation to her under the Victim Compensation Scheme.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/r39ggj/article32748184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02MADRASHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-laments-increasing-incidents-of-rape-being-reported-in-the-country/article32748185.ece
136,2020/10/02,I am here on Mission 2023: Manickam,"‘Only Congress can take on Modi’

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) State affairs incharge Manickam Tagore said that farmers were opposing the new Acts passed by Parliament. Addressing a gathering, while participating in Kisan Majdoor Bachav Diwas here on Friday, along with Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N Uttam Kumar Reddy, he claimed that only the Congress could take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""From this place in 1979, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had addressed a meeting. I am here on Mission 2023. AICC president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi sent me here to bring Congress back to power. Congress should win 79 seats in the next Assembly elections, a symbol of revival of the party. Sonia Gandhi dreamed of making everyone in Telangana benefit with formation of the State but it was limited to the family members of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Those who felt meted out injustice after Telangana formation should join hands with Congress. Mr. Rao has become the richest in Telangana and he will compete with Mukhesh Ambani in the next five years. It was only with commissions in projects while Ambani is in business,"" he said.

Mr. Tagore said Mr. Modi had handed over the fate of farmers to Adani and Ambani as they were going to decide the prices of farm produce.

The TPCC incharge said united fight would defeat the TRS and BJP as in the case of the British.

A protest programme against the three agriculture Acts passed by Parliament, signatures would be collected from the public on October 31 and would be handed over to President on November 14.

The TPCC president said the three Acts were against the interests of farmers. He questioned the promises by the Chief Minister of double bedroom houses, 12% reservation for minorities and three acres of land for dalits.

Candidate for Dubbak byelection would be declared in a day or two, he called upon party workers to go to Dubbak and work for victory.

Former deputy chief minister C. Damodar Rajanarasimha felt that election might be held 2022 as Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao would not prefer to complete five-year term.

AICC secretary N.S. Bose Raju, TPCC leaders J. Kusuma Kumar, Ponnam Prabhakar, and former minister J.

137,2020/10/02,Property valuation for Dharani on,"As per orders of the CS, details to be submitted to sub-registrar offices

The State government has launched valuation of each and every property in the State, both agricultural and non-agricultural, for incorporating them into Dharani portal, an online platform for accessing all land-related records, which will take off on the Vijayadasami day.

Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar issued orders, seeking basic value details of agricultural and non-agricultural properties that the gram panchayats and urban local bodies (ULBs) other than Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and the GHMC itself were supposed to furnish to sub-registrar offices (SROs) for updating on Dharani.

Officials said the basic values of properties had not been revised after formation of Telangana state. Hence, the values fixed by committees headed by Revenue Divisional Officers in rural areas and Joint Collectors in urban local bodies in 2013 would hold good. The committees used to revise the values twice an year in combined Andhra Pradesh prior to 2013. In the wake of Mr. Somesh Kumar's orders, Director of Municipal Administration N. Satyanarayana directed all municipal commissioners in the State to ensure that the revenue ward/block wise information of buildings and lands was furnished to SROs.

The orders of Chief Secretary explained that the government had decided to incorporate the basic values of agricultural and non-agricultural properties on Dharani portal to enable property owners to know them directly without anyone's intervention.

Value slabs

The current basic value of agricultural properties was by and large based on classification of survey numbers into three categories. Of these, those having potential for conversion to house sites and those abutting important roads were given higher basic value.

The remaining survey numbers had a lower basic value.

In the case of non-agricultural properties, the current basic value was based on door and ward/block numbers.

There were generally two market value slabs — general value and higher value. Door numbers that had higher value were identified and listed separately by the Registration department. The remaining properties were given general value.

The Telangana State Technology Services and Dharani team will develop a web application to be used by SROs. It will enable SROs to login, select gram panchayats or ULBs and enter basic value against each property on Dharani.

For both agricultural and non-agricultural properties in gram panchayats, the SROs will first record the basic values of those fetching higher values due to their proximity to highways or other considerations. Then, bulk recording of general values for remaining properties will be done.

The same procedure of recording basic value of high-valued and general value non-agricultural properties in ULBs other than GHMC will be taken up.

In GHMC areas, house numbers of ward/block which have higher values will be fixed with basic values. The SROs will use bulk recording feature to enter the general value of ward/block in the remaining house numbers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/vuenl3/article32755084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy02Onlinecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/property-valuation-for-dharani-on/article32755085.ece
138,2020/10/02,"Coronavirus spread is slow in Telangana, says study","ICMR-NIN completes second round sero-epidemiological survey in three districts of Telangana

The ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) which has carried out the second round of sero-epidemiological survey to monitor the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population in three districts of Telangana has come to the conclusion that the spread of virus is occurring at a ‘slow pace’.

This could be because of “appropriate measures taken, however, a large number of people are ‘still susceptible to the COVID-19 infection’, hence, the appropriate protection measures like ‘wearing of mask, personal hygiene and social distancing’ should be continued,” it said.

The second round of SARS Cov-2 sero-prevalence study had revealed that there were 83 positive (SARS Cov 2 IgG antibodies), out of 454 people tested in Jangaon (18.2%) as against 0.5% in the first round carried out during May 2020. In Nalgonda, 47 were positive (11.1%) out of 422 people tested, as against only 0.25% in the first round. Similarly in Kamareddy district 30 (6.9%) were positive out of 433 people tested as against 0.25% in the first round indicating the slow pace.

The study is part of the nation-wide survey being spearheaded by ICMR and the baseline survey was conducted in the above mentioned districts of Telangana and the second one too was carried out during 26-27 August in the same districts and same villages. As per the ICMR guidelines, 10 villages/wards were selected in each district and from each selected village ward, about 16 households were selected randomly for the study. All the available subjects ≥10 year’s males and females from the selected houses were covered for the survey.

The study was carried out by NIN in association with the Telangana Department of Health and Family Welfare. The State health authorities were also actively supported to ensure smooth conducting of house-to-house survey in 30 villages across three districts with about 1,309 subjects covered.

ICMR-NIN’s scientist and nodal officer Avula Laxmaiah conducted the survey with support of other senior scientists B. Dinesh Kumar, N.Arlappa, J.J. Babu, and other 50 scientific/technical staff, participated in the survey. From the Government side — Health Secretary Syed Ali MurtazRaizvi, Finance Secretary Ronald Rose and TB programme Joint Director Rajesham and others played a key role.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/wq7sls/article32757315.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy02Surveycol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/coronavirus-spread-is-slow-in-state-says-study/article32752711.ece

Nagulapally Venkatesh, a married man is in late 20s with three children lives with his father Nagulapally Lingam (55) and his septuagenarian grandfather Anjaiah in Etigaddakishtapur of Toguta mandal. Etigaddakishtapur is one of the villages submerging under Mallannasagar reservoir.

On September 4, the families of Venkatesh and 10 others vacated the village and shifted to double bedroom houses constructed at Lakshmapur. They were given temporary accommodation there with a promise that they would be allotted houses/ house sites at Sangapur. While Venkatesh wanted to have a house constructed by the government in Rehabilitation and Resettlement Colony under package for oustees, both Lingam and Anjaiah opted for money of ₹ 5.04 lakh in lieu of houses being constructed by the government.

After Rampur and Laxmapur under Mallannasagar, this was the first major shift of oustees from the native village. “Our houses are almost on the bund and it was not possible to construct the bund without demolishing our houses. Hence, the officials asked us to vacate and we were shown temporary accommodation here. However, registration papers of our houses were not yet handed over to us,” Venkatesh told The Hindu.

As the construction of Kondapochammasagar was already completed and oustees got accommodated at Tunkibollaram, the administration of Siddipet has been focusing on getting the villages under Mallannasagar vacated. As part of that, some families from Etigaddakishtapur got vacated and now the focus is on Erravalli and Singaram in Kondapaka mandal. Both these submerging villages fall under the limits of Gajwel Assembly constituency while other villages are under Dubbak Assembly constituency where by-elections are scheduled on November 3.

It’s been seven months since the first COVID case was detected in Telangana on March 2.

One of the questions frequently asked about the pandemic is whether incidence of the infectious disease has come down. The numbers hold the answer.

Out of the total 1,93,600 cases recorded in the State till the end of September, 65,903 were recorded in September alone, which is 34% of the total. This is the highest number of cases recorded in a month.

Apart from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), around 100-200 cases a day are recorded in other districts, including Warangal Urban, Nalgonda, Karimnagar, Bhadradri Kothagudem and Khammam. Officials of the State Health department said that they were focusing on these districts to bring down the incidence.

In GHMC, 300 to 350 cases are recorded every day. But, according to senior officials, when the one crore population in the municipal limits is considered, the case load is low.

Of the total 30,50,444 tests, 53% samples were checked in the last month. Everyday, barring Sunday, around 50,000 to 55,000 people undergo tests across the State. Of them, around 10,000 are in the city.

Meanwhile, the father-in-law of the woman told reporters she had died as the police didn’t act in time. “If the police had acted when she had approached them, she would have been here with us,” he said.

On Friday, the police arrested Arvind Choudhary, one of the accused, and his father Motilal, who allegedly insulted her. On Monday, the woman had gone to fetch fodder for cattle along with her nieces when the alleged incident took place.

The other two accused of rape, Parshu Choudhary and Anil Rai, were absconding and the police had declared a reward of ₹5,000 for information on them, said Mr. Yadav. “We are yet to receive the post-mortem report.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mp-police-officer-held-after-death-of-rape-victim/article32754960.ece

Extending an olive branch, J&K Lieutenant-Governor, Manoj Sinha on Friday offered jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities to those “misguided youth who are ready to shun violence and return to the mainstream”.

“I urge the misguided youth to shun violence and return to the mainstream. The government is ready to help all with jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities,” Mr. Sinha said in volatile south Kashmir’s Shopian during a public programme.

Mr. Sinha was speaking on the occasion of the 151st birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. He launched the Jammu and Kashmir government’s ambitious ‘Back to Village-3’ programme in Shopian’s Shirmal area.

“People of J&K, especially the youth, want to tread the path of progress and development. The government is committed to making J&K a role model of development and prosperity. We will empower youth and strengthen Panchayati Raj institutions,” Mr. Sinha said.

It is for the first time since the August 5 move to repeal Jammu and Kashmir’s special status that the J&K administration has decided to soften its stand towards armed youth active in the region.

Tribute to Gandhi

Mr. Sinha, while remembering the bond that Mahatma Gandhi shared with villages, said the Back to Village-3 programme, where senior officers visit villages and help address developmental issues, “is a tribute to the Mahatma’s bond and aspirations with respect to villages”.

“The ‘Back to Village’ is a bridge between the public and the administration. The government is persistently delivering services and helping them join the mainstream. Efforts are being made to make villages atmanirbhar (self-reliant),” he said.

He said that the action-based execution of administrative changes being brought in J&K would not only pave the way for unprecedented development in J&K but also show a new path of development to the entire nation.

The L-G called upon the public to interact and give thorough feedback to visiting officers during the programme.

“I assure the public that the programme is not a one-time event, but a part of regular grievance redressal mechanism under which senior officers are to address grievances at subdivision level every Wednesday on rotational basis,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8vek9k/article32753844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MANOJSINHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jobs-opportunities-for-misguided-youth-ready-to-shun-violence-says-jk-l-g/article32753845.ece

The child who claimed to be a relative of the victim alleged that the telephones of all family members had been taken away by police and their entire house and the neighbourhood was put under lockdown, with no one being allowed to enter or leave.

Hathras gang rape | Cremation of victim shocked our conscience, says Allahabad High Court

“The U.P. government has taken to brutality cover up the truth. Neither us, nor the media is being allowed to meet the victim’s family. Neither are they allowed to come out. On top of this, the family members of the victim are being beaten up and brutalised. No one in India will support such a behaviour,” he said in a tweet in Hindi while sharing the video.

This comes a day after the former Congress president and sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were detained by the police and sent back to Delhi, after they tried to reach Hathras to meet the family of the victim.

Priyanka Gandhi also took a swipe against the Uttar Pardesh government over the manner in which it was dealing with the public.

Greeting people on former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri’s birth anniversary, she cited a quote by him that said, “Those who rule should see how people react to the administration. Ultimately the public is the leader.”

149,2020/10/02,Controversial Assam exam for police SIs rescheduled,"A BJP leader allegedly involved in the leaking of question paper ahead of the written exam on September 20 was arrested while a former DIG believed to be the kingpin is absconding

The written test for the recruitment of 597 unarmed Sub-Inspectors of the Assam police, which was cancelled in September following a question paper leak, has been rescheduled on November 22.

The State Level Police Recruitment Board (SLPRB), which conducts exams for the department, assured all applicants that the examination process will be “totally transparent” and each candidate will “get a fair opportunity to compete”.

A formal notification providing procedural details will be published in due course, an Assam police spokesperson said on Friday.

At least 20 people, including Bharatiya Janata Party leader Diban Deka, have been arrested in connection with the leaking of question paper for the recruitment test that was scheduled on September 20.

The alleged kingpin of the question paper scam, retired Deputy Inspector-General of Police Prasanta Kumar Dutta, has been absconding.

The scam came to light after a handwritten replica of the question paper was posted on social media. Following the lead, the police seized the question papers from a guest house near the Assam Assembly where 50 candidates had appeared for the “written test” on September 19.

Sleuths of the Crime Investigation Department said a candidate paid up to ₹4 lakh to get hold of a copy of the question paper.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bte7pr/article32752307.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Assampolice,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/controversial-assam-exam-for-police-sis-rescheduled/article32752308.ece
150,2020/10/02,Coronavirus | ‘11% of doctors dying due to COVID-19 are from West Bengal’,"Doctors have a high fatality rate because they are exposed to high viral load, says founding member of doctors’ forum

As many as 51 of the 454 doctors in the country who have died so far due to COVID-19 are from West Bengal, a statistic that’s worrying the medical fraternity in the State.

Even though the daily count of COVID-19 cases reported in the State remains at over 3,000, it is better off than many other States that periodically continue to witness an explosion in the number of cases, and that it should still account for 11% of doctors’ death is emerging as a matter of concern.

“We are one of the most populous States, and doctors have a high fatality rate because they are exposed to high viral load. But since the rate is substantially high [in West Bengal], we all need to earnestly search for the causes,” Dr. Arjun Dasgupta, a founding member of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, told The Hindu.

Another reputed doctor who did not wish to be named said that negligence could be a cause for the high number of deaths even though it was highly unlikely that doctors, of all people, would be negligent. “It is also possible that we are reporting each and every case [of a doctor’s death due to COVID-19], which some other States may not be doing. But whatever the reason, the rate at which doctors are dying is indeed worrisome and needs to be examined,” the doctor said.

Two among the dead were even younger: Dr. Nitish Kumar, a senior resident at the R.N. Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Science, was 36; and Dr. Surendra Nath Bera, a gynaecologist, was 34.

151,2020/10/02,Akhil Gogoi’s group forms political party,"Raijor Dal is the fourth to have been birthed ahead of the 2021 Assam polls

Jailed peasant rights activist Akhil Gogoi’s group Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) and about 70 associate organisations on Friday floated a political party, the fourth to have been birthed ahead of the 2021 Assam polls.

The regional entity, largely sired by the movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), has been named Raijor Dal, meaning People’s Party.

“We have formed the party to defeat the fascist Bharatiya Janata Party and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in the 2021 elections besides keeping the communal combine of the Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) at bay,” the new party said in a statement.

The minority-based AIUDF is headed by Maulana Badruddin Ajmal, a perfume baron and Lok Sabha member from Assam.

“The constituents of Raijor Dal decided to float the party under the prevailing extraordinary circumstances in the country and the State. The fascist government imposed the CAA completely disregarding the public movement against it, thus triggering the need for our own political party,” the party said.

‘Doors open to all’

KMSS president Bhasco de Saikia said the Raijor Dal was an “inclusive” political party that would keep its doors open to people from all communities. It would endeavour to make Assam a leading State.

Filmmaker Jahnu Baruah, who was present at the party’s launch in Guwahati, described the day as “historic” for Assam.

“There has been a belief among people that Assam will be ruined if all communities cannot unite. Everyone said this is the last battle for protecting the rights of the indigenous people. So, they took a resolve despite differences and came together,” Mr. Baruah said.

The Raijor Dal is the second regional party in Assam formed within a month. In September, the influential All Assam Students’ Union and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chhatra Parishad floated the Asom Jatiya Parishad (AJP).

Formation of 2 parties

Earlier this year, people from various walks of life formed parties called the Asom Gana Mancha and the Asom Songrami Mancha. The second one merged with the AJP on September 26.

All the new parties have trained their guns on the BJP.

“In a democracy, anyone can float a political party. We welcome the formation of the political parties. It will only benefit the BJP,” the party’s Assam unit chief Ranjit Kumar Dass told journalists.

For the KMSS, the Raijor Dal is the second political venture in five years. It formed the Gana Mukti Sangram, Asom in March 2015 for “changing the capitalist system of India” but it could not be sustained.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/l9quu9/article32752133.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AKHILGOGOI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/akhil-gogois-group-forms-political-party/article32752134.ece
152,2020/10/02,"Govt. extends ‘disturbed area’ tag for 3 districts, 4 police stations in Arunachal Pradesh under AFSPA","The Union Home Ministry said in a notification that the order came into effect from October 1

The Centre has declared three districts and four police stations in three other districts in Arunachal Pradesh as “disturbed area” under the AFSPA for six more months after review of insurgent activities and the law and order situation there.

The Union Home Ministry said in a notification that the order came into effect from October 1.

”...Tirap, Changlang and Longding districts in Arunachal Pradesh and the areas falling within the jurisdiction of the following four police stations in other districts of Arunachal Pradesh, bordering the State of Assam, are declared as ‘disturbed area’ under Section 3 of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 up to 31.03.2021 w.e.f. 01.10.2020, unless withdrawn earlier,” the notification said.

The four police stations are Namsai and Mahadevpur in Namsai district, Roing in Lower Dibang Valley and Sunpura in Lohit district.

The AFSPA is imposed in areas where armed forces are required to operate in aid to civil authorities. For AFSPA to become valid, an area, however, needs to be declared disturbed either by the central or the Sate government under section 3 of the 1958 Act.

153,2020/10/02,Two killed and cremated in Assam for ‘practising witchcraft’,"Murder case registered against nine, who confessed to the killing: police

The police in central Assam’s Karbi Anglong district have arrested nine people, including three women, for killing two persons for allegedly practising witchcraft.

Police said a murder case was registered under the Indian Penal Code and the Assam Witch Hunting (Prohibition, Prevention and Protection) Act against the nine, who confessed to the killing.

The incident happened in Rahimapur, an Adivasi village about 80 km from district headquarters Diphu, on September 30.

Kangaroo court ‘verdict’

“A 50-year-old woman and an unrelated 28-year-old man were killed and cremated together after a kangaroo court, held in the courtyard of the village headman, held them responsible for the death of a girl on September 27,” District Superintendent of Police Debojit Deuri told The Hindu.

The two were accused of practising black magic that made the girl fall ill and die.

“All the nine arrested confessed to having killed and cremated the two. Six others accused in the case are absconding,” Mr. Deuri said.

A local police officer, recounting the confessional statements, said the two were bludgeoned to death. Remains of their bodies recovered from the pyre have been collected for forensic test.

Social malaise

Witch-hunting has been an age-old social malaise in Assam, mostly reported from the western part of the State. Data presented in the Assembly said it claimed the lives of 107 people from 2011 to November 2019.

In 201, the police launched Project Prahari to counsel certain communities against practising witch-hunting. The initiative by former Director General of Police, Kuladhar Saikia, followed the killing of five people after they were labelled “witches” in Kokrajhar district’s Thaigarguri village.

Karbi Anglong district has not been as notorious for witch-hunting but has recorded several instances of lynching in recent years. The most infamous among them was the killing of two adventure-loving Assamese friends – Goa-based sound engineer Nilotpal Das and Guwahati-based businessman Abhijeet Nath – on June 8, 2018.

On February 28, a court in Diphu awarded life imprisonment to 12 people for lynching 16-year-old Jhankar Saikia on July 1, 2013, following a tiff over an auto-rickshaw charging ₹10 more than the normal fare.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/aoedy2/article22888459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-stock-rape-delhi-20180301,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/two-killed-and-cremated-in-assam-for-practising-witchcraft/article32751412.ece
154,2020/10/02,Bengal Minister calls Governor Dhankhar “Noirajyapal”,"At an event to observe Gandhi Jayanti

Differences between Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and the West Bengal government came to fore on Friday at an event to observe Gandhi Jayanti. Senior Minister Bratya Basu, who accompanied the Governor at Gandhi Ghat Barrackpore, called the Governor “Noirajyapal”. (Noirajya means lawlessness or anarchy in Bengal and Rajyapal refers to Governor) also (Noi means ‘no’ in Bengali).

“Ask him what his views on the DM [district magistrate] Hathras trying to intimidate the family members of the victim… Why by making such comments, he is putting a prefix of ‘Noi’ to his name turning his name from ‘Rajyapal’ to ‘Noirajyapal’,” Mr Basu told journalists at the venue.

Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay and Leader of the Opposition Abdul Mannan were present.

Earlier, the Governor Dhankhar raised a number of issues, including political violence, ‘denial’ of PM Kisan benefits to the State farmers and ‘targeting’ of the Raj Bhawan. “I will appeal everyone to free West Bengal of political violence. There should not be bomb-making factories and terror modules here,” he told journalists after paying homage to the Father of The Nation.

Differences between the government and the Raj Bhawan have come to fore many a times.

Leader of the Opposition Andul Mannan called the development unfortunate.

155,2020/10/02,"Smart papas, smarter mamas fight school dropout","Besides ensuring education for their children, some mothers in Goalpara district have become literate through study groups

A set of questions from the child development protection officer (CDPO) in Krishnai-Balijana Circle of western Assam's Goalpara district stumped Jagdish Nath less than a year ago.

Some of the questions concerning his daughter Chayanika read: ‘Who is your child's class teacher?’ ‘Do you interact with your teacher for your child’s health?’ ‘How many times did you go to school in the last three months regarding your child’s mental and physical growth?’

At Kuruabhakha village in the same circle, Bhabani Rabha was more at ease with a similar set of questions. But she had no clue to questions such as, ‘Can you tell me a poem from the Assamese book of your child?’

Ms. Rabha, who had dropped out of high school, was among 38 out of 50 mothers who said ‘no’. This made her realise that unlike some of the illiterate mothers in the village, she needed to be involved more with the education of her two children – a son and a daughter, both in Class 10 – besides her self-help group formed under the Assam State Rural Livelihood Mission.

“I tended to agree to everything our daughter demanded and had no idea that her diet need to have rich, locally available nutrients. So, I volunteered for the Smart Papa campaign and motivated other fathers for ensuring a healthy lifestyle,” Mr. Nath said.

All near a shop

For CDPO Nileswar Roy, Mr Nath’s shop being located strategically in the Budhipara-Dorapara area helped; most men in the surrounding villages often gathered at the spot.

“We had a target of orienting 15,000 fathers in a year when we launched the campaign in March. But the COVID-19 pandemic and a series of lockdowns came in the way although a supervisor [from Integrated Child Development Services] is assigned to call 10 fathers in a batch and conduct sessions on healthy living,” Mr Roy said.

The mothers turned out to be smarter through a similar campaign dovetailed with a female literacy drive and goalmart.co.in, an online platform provided by the Goalpara district administration for marketing their handicraft and farm produce.

“The campaign entails tagging mothers with class teachers toward decreasing school dropout and increasing community participation for a better educational environment. Another major component has been on awareness about sexual harassment of children, to differentiate good touch from bad touch,” said block elementary education officer Rita Rabha from Dudhnoi, about 110 km west of Guwahati and 30 km east of district headquarters Goalpara.

Grandmothers too pitch in

In the course of taking interest in the education of their children, some mothers – grandmothers like septuagenarian Madhubala Banikya of Dhupdhara too – have learnt to write sentences and do simple arithmetic.

“Apart from natural calamities that afflict our aspirational district, low literacy rate among the women has been a major challenge. A corps of 690 youth trained as educators undertook a three-month female literacy programme and helped make 6,895 women literate so far,” Goalpara’s Deputy Commissioner Varnali Deka, an alumna of IIT-Bombay, told The Hindu.

Literacy, officials said, had made the local mothers’ associations more confident of coordinating with teachers and keeping track of how their children fare in schools that have begun to open post-pandemic. The women have also formed study groups to help each other, particularly in basic bookkeeping for commercial ventures through self-help groups.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/s7qs1n/article32751259.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/photo1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/smart-papas-smarter-mamas-fight-school-dropout/article32751250.ece

An all-religion prayer meet was organised at the Sabarmati Ashram here on Friday morning on the occasion of 151st birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi with only a handful of people attending the event due to the coronavirus outbreak.

In view of the pandemic, only a limited number of Ashram residents attended the prayer meet held in premises of the Sabarmati Ashram, also called the Gandhi Ashram, said its director Atul Pandya.

The Ashram, currently closed for visitors due to the pandemic, was the home of Mahatma Gandhi between 1917 and 1930 and closely linked with India’s freedom struggle.

It is managed by the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust.

“We have an old tradition of organising an all-religion prayer meet on Gandhi Jayanti. Normally, citizens and students are invited to attend it.

“But this time, due to coronavirus, only a few Ashram residents were allowed to attend the prayer meet,” said Mr Pandya.

He said all COVID-19-related protocols and social distancing norms were followed at the prayer meet and no other event was scheduled at the Ashram on Friday.

The trust website telecast the prayer meet live so that others could attend it virtually, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7k3wfb/article32751102.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SABARMATIASHRAMKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/all-religion-prayer-meet-at-sabarmati-ashram-on-gandhi-jayanti/article32751103.ece
157,2020/10/02,"Bihar Assembly election | LJP to go it alone, but backs Narendra Modi","The party will contest 143 seats on a pro-BJP, anti-Nitish Kumar plank.

It is almost certain that the Lok Janshakti Party will contest 143 seats outside the NDA alliance with the slogan “Modi se bair nahi, Nitish teri khair nahi,” which roughly translates to “No enmity with Modi but won’t spare [Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) president] Nitish Kumar.”

LJP president Chirag Paswan met with BJP president J.P. Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday. It is a friendly alliance, with the BJP offering not to contest in the seats that will fall into its kitty. The LJP has also given the BJP an assurance that in the post-poll scenario, it will back the BJP’s candidate for the Chief Minister’s post. A formal announcement is likely to be made over the weekend.

Senior LJP leader said that his party was in alliance with the NDA at the national level and it was not a State-level alliance. Technically, therefore, his party is not formally walking out of the NDA. With party patriarch Ramvilas Paswan seriously ill and undergoing treatment at a Delhi hospital, his resignation from the Cabinet post is completely ruled out.

BJP proxy

Practically, the LJP will work as the BJP’s proxy. “In the 2015 elections, the BJP had contested on 157 seats; with the JD(U) wishing to play the big brother in the alliance, they will get fewer than 120 seats, so there will be 37 candidates of the BJP who will have nowhere to go but find space with us,” a senior LJP leader said.

To counter the JD(U)’s candidates, the LJP, a Dalit outfit, is likely to field the so-called upper caste candidates, according to its strategist. The whole idea is to mop up the anti-Nitish and pro-Modi votes, on the JD(U) seats. The whole campaign of the party will also be pro-BJP and anti-Nitish.

The LJP has proposed this as a win-win situation for both the BJP and the party. The BJP gets to accommodate its candidates, albeit under the LJP symbol, while the LJP will be able to increase its profile manifold.

In the 2015 Assembly election, fighting on 42 seats, the LJP got only 4.83% of total vote share and won only two seats. Its best performance was 29 seats in 2005. “When we contest 143 seats, our vote share will naturally go up. We won’t be a 5% party any more,” another LJP leader added.

The LJP is also presenting it as a fait accompli, considering the division of seats would leave them with a measly 20-25 odd seats. “We do not really have an option here. This is a far lower tally than what we are ready to settle for. And thankfully, we have been working over a year and have serious candidates for all the 143 seats,” the leader added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nsxrkg/article32545388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-ljp-chirag-paswan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bihar-assembly-election-ljp-to-go-it-alone-but-backs-narendra-modi/article32751042.ece

Political pressure on the Uttar Pradesh government continued on Friday over its handling of the Hathras gang rape and the rushed late night cremation of the victim.

In a late evening development, the State government suspended Hathras Superintendent of Police Vikrant Vir and four other officials for negligence over the incident. The action was taken on the basis of the first report submitted by the Special Investigation Team, said Awanish Awasthi, Additional Chief Secretary (Home).

With the Hathras administration continuing to bar the entry of outsiders, the situation at the victim’s village of Bulgaddhi remained tense. A delegation of Trinamool Congress MPs, which tried to reach the village to meet the victim’s family, was manhandled and Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien pushed to the ground by the police about 1.5 km from the village. Later in the day, more leaders from Congress, Aam Admi Party and Peace Party of India were turned back by the district administration.

The Trinamool leaders, including Lok Sabha MPs Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and Pratima Mondal and former MP Mamata Thakur, apart from Mr. O’Brien, said they had travelled individually to the village to ensure that Section 144 imposed in the area is not violated.

The police refused to let even the women MPs go and meet the victim’s family, despite repeated requests. When Ms. Mondal tried to walk towards the victim’s house, she was blocked by SDM Prem Prakash Meena.

Hathras gang rape | Victim’s family alleges intimidation by officials

This led to a tussle between Mr. Meena and Mr. O’ Brien, in which the MP was pushed down. The delegation later staged a dharna around a kilometre away from the victim's home.

“We are here on a peaceful mission to pay condolences to the grieving family. Lady MP was manhandled by U.P. SDM,” Mr O’ Brien tweeted.

The scuffle with the administration came a day after Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were arrested on the Yamuna Expressway by the Uttar Pradesh police and prevented from entering Hathras.

CM’s assurance

Breaking his silence on the gangrape, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said forces who even harbour ill thoughts against the honour and self-respect of mothers and sisters in the State would be completely annihilated.

In a tweet in Hindi on Friday, Mr Adityanath promised a punishment that will become an example for the future. He said the U.P. government was bound by oath to protect “mothers and sisters” in the State.

The Chief Minister’s tweets came after he interacted with the father of the victim on Wednesday via video conferencing and promised him ₹25 lakh as compensation and a job for a family member.

Fear in village

A young boy who described himself as the brother of the victim and claimed he had escaped the police cordon on the pretext of collecting fodder, told media persons at the barricades, that there was an atmosphere of fear in the village. “Everybody has been asked to remain inside and the police were instilling fear among villagers. The mobile phones of many villagers have been collected by the policemen,” the boy said.

The young boy who identified himself as Gajendra alleged that the policemen were colluding with the accused.

As the day progressed, members of the All India Kshatriya Mahasabha gathered outside the village and threatened to hold a panchayat supporting the four men accused of the gangrape and brutal assault on the Dalit girl.

A day after a video of him threatening the family went viral on Thursday, district magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar remained inaccessible to media persons on Friday. Some media persons tried to take alternative routes to enter the village but they were stopped and sent back. Sources said the mobiles of the villagers were collected after one of them recorded the DM’s conversation with the family and leaked it to the media.

Later in the day, Prakash Kumar, Assistant Superintendent of Police, told reporters that the entry of politicians and media persons was banned because the Special investigation Team’s was in the village. ""We have inputs that some people want to spoil the law and order situation in the village. These restrictions will continue till the situation improves and the SIT completes its job,"" he said.

162,2020/10/02,Tripura MP seeks railway division for State,"Member of Parliament Rebati Tripura has requested Union Railways Minister Pijush Goyal to sanction a separate railway division for Tripura. The State has been under the Lumding division of the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR), which has jurisdiction over northeast and a portion of eastern India.

He spoke to the Union Minister through video conferencing. Mr. Tripura said he had placed three demands before the Minister. Besides a separate Railway Division, he urged the Minister to create a Railway Recruitment Board for the State and doubling of rail track for fast movement of trains.

Mr. Tripura said the creation of a separate division and recruitment board would open up employment opportunities for the youth of the State. The Minister had assured him that the proposals would be considered, he said.

Mr. Tripura, who was elected from the East Tripura reserved constituency, said he also discussed skill development schemes for the returnee migrants.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tripura-mp-seeks-railway-division-for-state/article32748312.ece
163,2020/10/02,Farmers continue protests across Punjab,"Akali Dal stands exposed, says Congress.

Members of as many as 31 farmer outfits on Thursday blocked railway traffic by squatting on tracks in many parts of Punjab as a part of their indefinite ‘rail roko’ agitation, against Centre’s agriculture sector legislations.

Groups of farmers also staged dharnas outside residences of several BJP leaders. Besides, the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) took out a ‘kisan march’ in several parts of the State.

Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bhartaiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), said farmer groups had laid siege to 30 railway tracks across the State. “We have started ‘dharnas’ at key toll plazas. We have also started a campaign to boycott products of corporate houses that we believe have a big hand in getting the farm legislations passed by the Central government,” he said.

The Akali Dal’s march started from all three Sikh religious Takhts — Sri Akal Takht at Amritsar, Sri Damdama Sahib at Talwandi Sabo and Sri Keshgarh Sahib at Sri Anandpur Sahib — and culminated in Mohali district.

Congress leader and Cabinet Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa hit out at the Akali Dal, saying that the march was nothing but “an unsuccessful attempt by the so called ‘panthic’ party to revive its political fortunes”. “Its mask of duplicity has come off and it stands exposed not only before Punjab but the whole world. Already the Sikh Panth has discarded the Akali Dal in the aftermath of the sacrilege and firing incidents at Bargari and Behbal Kalan and now the farmers have also come to know the true colours of SAD. These attempts by the SAD for regaining the lost political ground will prove futile,” said Mr. Randhawa.

164,2020/10/02,"Punjab withdraws night curfew, Sunday lockdown","Govt. decision due to fall in virus cases

With COVID-19 cases and deaths falling, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday announced a slew of relaxations, including lifting of the night curfew and withdrawal of the lockdown on Sundays.

The number of people taking part at weddings and funerals has been increased to 100 in line with the Union government’s guidelines under ‘Unlock 5.0’. The limit of three passengers in a car has been eased and buses can take in passengers at 50% of their capacity on condition that the windows be kept open.

Captain Amarinder Singh has directed Director-General of Police Dinkar Gupta to ensure strict adherence to the protocol and take immediate action against those violating the mandatory use of face masks. He insisted that there be no laxity in view of the ongoing paddy procurement operations and the coming festival season.

As for the reopening of schools and educational institutions, which the Centre has left to the States to decide after October 15, the final decision will be announced after discussions between the Home Secretary and the Education Department.

Review meeting

At a virtual meeting to review the COVID-19 situation, the Chief Minister said the restrictions imposed earlier had helped to keep the cases down. However, he voiced concern over the increase in the number of cases in rural areas.

In a brief presentation, K.K. Talwar, head of the expert health committee, said the positivity rate had come down from 10.85% on September 14 to 5.12% on September 28.

168,2020/10/02,Indian Premier League 2020 | Sunrisers rides on Garg and Abhishek’s dazzling performance,"The two add 77 for the fifth wicket in seven overs after the team slips to 69 for four; Super Kings’ batting comes undone yet again.

A week’s break seemed to have made little difference to Chennai Super Kings, as it slumped to its third straight defeat in as many matches, losing by seven runs to Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Dubai International Stadium on Friday.

Chasing a target of 165, the Super Kings batsmen looked all at sea, yet again, with no real intent shown against a disciplined Sunrisers attack. The chase got off to a poor start with Shane Watson (1) and Ambati Rayudu (8) falling cheaply. Rashid Khan and Abdul Samad then applied the squeeze in the middle overs to suffocate M.S. Dhoni's men. Only Faf du Plessis looked like forcing the issue, hitting four boundaries in a 19-ball 22, but he was run out.

Middle-order struggle

The middle-order of Kedar Jadhav, Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja struggled against the spinners with the score reading 44 for four at the halfway stage. After taking 18 balls to get his first boundary, Jadeja did produce a late blitz (50, 35b, 5x4, 2x6) with skipper Dhoni remaining unbeaten on 47 off 36 balls. But it was too little too late.

Earlier, after electing to bat, a late flourish from youngsters Priyam Garg (51 n.o., 26b, 6x4, 1x6) and Abhishek Sharma helped Sunrisers Hyderabad post 164 after it was reduced to 69 for four.

Tall order

Garg and Abhishek (31, 24b, 4x4, 1x6) had the tall order of rebuilding the innings and the youngsters proved equal to the task, taking time to settle in before erupting towards the end. The duo put on 77 for the fifth wicket off 42 balls.

Sunrisers lost Jonny Bairstow in the first over before Manish Pandey (29, 21b, 5x4) showed promise with some clean hitting in the V. But it didn't amount to much. After Pandey’s dismissal, Warner tried to take charge and hit Piyush Chawla for two boundaries, but the leggie had him caught spectacularly by du Plessis at long-on. Off the very next ball, Kane Williamson was run out.

It was then that the Garg-Abhishek double-act unfolded. Abhishek was the initial aggressor, hitting Jadeja for a four and six, before Garg tore into Sam Curran in the 17th over, hitting him for three fours and a six. The Super Kings were tardy on the field, with Jadeja and Shardul Thakur dropping Abhishek off back-to-back deliveries. Sunrisers collected 64 runs from the last five overs, a phase that ultimately proved the difference.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/g6jmns/article32754579.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRIYAMGARG,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-chennai-super-kings-vs-sunrisers-hyderabad-in-dubai/article32753337.ece
169,2020/10/02,ICC women’s T20 rankings | India overtakes New Zealand to rise to third,"Australia and England retain the top two positions in T20s, their points tally remaining 291 and 280, respectively.

The Indian women’s cricket team has overtaken New Zealand to rise to the third spot in the T20 International standings and retained the second position in the ODI chart of the latest ICC rankings released on Friday.

Australia and England retain the top two positions in T20s, their points tally remaining 291 and 280, respectively.

India (270), who made the final of this year’s T20 World Cup, are a point ahead of New Zealand (269), the ICC said in a statement.

The biggest improvement in rankings has been registered by Brazil, who are up 11 places to 27, after a gain of 15 rating points, while the biggest ranking fall has been for Malaysia, who are down from 31st to 38th.

Samoa (up two places to 16th), Indonesia (up two places to 20th) and the United States of America (up four places to 31st) are among other teams to have made notable progress.

Three teams have lost their place on the rankings table. Denmark and Belgium have not played any matches since October 2017 while Qatar have played fewer than the required six during the period.

In the ODI rankings, India (121) and England (119) have lost four points each while clinging on to their second and third positions respectively.

Six-time world champions and winners of both editions of the ICC Women’s Championship, Australia’s stellar display during the rating period saw them win 20 of 21 ODIs, increasing their tally by eight points to 160.

Their massive lead of 39 points over second-placed India is the largest by any team (men or women) in any form of the game.

It comes on the back of 3-0 series wins over India, Pakistan, New Zealand, England, West Indies, Sri Lanka and an earlier 2-1 victory over England in 2017.

At the fourth spot is South Africa (107), who enjoy a 13-point lead over New Zealand (94), with the West Indies (85), Pakistan (77), Bangladesh (61) and Sri Lanka (47) following in that order.

170,2020/10/02,Indian Premier League 2020 | A high octane contest on cards as Delhi takes on Kolkata,"Pant needs it more than Russell as three of his peers, KL Rahul, Ishan Kishan and Sanju Samson have all got runs under their belt.

Andre Russell’s brute power will meet its match in Rishabh Pant’s fearless approach when Kolkata Knight Riders face Delhi Capitals with an aim to light up the Sharjah skyline in what promises to be another six-hitting IPL contest in Sharjah on Saturday.

Russell gave a glimpse of what is in store with three sixes on a big Dubai ground against Rajasthan Royals while Pant will be itching to throw caution to the winds and play his natural game of destructive edge of the seat hitting.

In fact, Pant needs it more than Russell as three of his peers, KL Rahul, Ishan Kishan and Sanju Samson have all got runs under their belt, something that the beefy man from Roorkee so desperately needs.

This will be the first weekend of double headers in the IPL and there couldn’t have been a better ground for that than Sharjah with ridiculously short boundaries promising another run-fest.

If there is Shubman Gill, Andre Russell and Eoin Morgan in one side, there is Pant, Marcus Stoinis and Shreyas Iyer on the other end, all capable big-hitters and ever-ready to add to the whopping 62 sixes that has been hit on this ground in the two games held there so far.

KKR have been slowly getting into the groove with some comprehensive performances while Capitals, after two fine victories, hit a roadblock against Sunrisers Hyderabad in their last outing.

For the Knights, their young pace attack of Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi will have their task cut out on a batting paradise where their temperament will be put to test.

In Sharjah, a bowler is destined to go for runs and how the two manage that and try subtle variations will be key to KKR’s success.

KKR is unlikely to tinker with their winning combination even though Sunil Narine as an opener hasn’t worked well for them in the three games with only 24 runs scored by the Trinidad all-rounder.

However, he has bowled his full quota of overs in three games with a decent under 8 economy rate and two wickets.

There is Tom Banton as a reserve opener but keeping the dimensions of the Sharjah ground into equation, KKR will pursue with Narine provided he can attack the weak link in the DC attack which obviously will be an Indian pacer -- be it Mohit Sharma, Ishant Sharma or Avesh Khan.

The problem with most of the Indian pacers in DC is either back of the length or length balls which is cannon fodder on Sharjah strip, something bowling coach Ryan harris would like to work on.

In their batting department, Shimron Hetmyer is yet to fire but again the same formula that applies to Narine in KKR is also applicable on the former West Indies U-19 World Cup winning captain, provided he can take on Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy.

Hetmyer has had some degree of success against Kuldeep in the international games and it could be an engaging contest provided he gets a chance to bat on a track where history always favours the top four batters from either side.

Squads

Delhi Capitals: Shreyas Iyer (c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Shikhar Dhawan, Prithvi Shaw, Shimron Hetmyer, Kagiso Rabada, Ajinkya Rahane, Amit Mishra, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ishant Sharma, Axar Patel, Sandeep Lamichhane, Keemo Paul, Daniel Sams, Mohit Sharma, Anrich Nortje, Alex Carey (wk), Avesh Khan, Tushar Deshpande, Harshal Patel, Marcus Stoinis, Lalit Yadav.

171,2020/10/02,Indian Premier League 2020 | Battle of Royals in first afternoon game,"Both Royals and the RCB go into Saturday’s afternoon match with two wins in three games.

The dew factor will go out of the window but the searing heat will be an issue when Royal Challengers Bangalore take on a better prepared Rajasthan Royals in the first of the 10 IPL double-headers in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

Having played their first two games at Sharjah, the smallest of the three venues, Royals got their strategy wrong in the game against Kolkata Knight Riders in Dubai.

The ground in Abu dhabi too is on the bigger side and Royals’ experience of playing in Dubai will help them take more informed decisions. RCB will also be making their first appearance at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium.

With the batsmen unable to hit through the line as consistently as they could do in Sharjah, Royals failed to chase 175 against KKR on Wednesday.

Since they have a settled overseas players’ combination, one possible change in the eleven could be replacing pacer Ankit Rajpoot with Varun Aaron, who is yet to get a game.

The team has benched young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal after Jos Buttler’s arrival but calls have been growing for his inclusion. With the top three picking themselves, the stylish southpaw can only play in the middle order.

Both Royals and the RCB go into Saturday’s afternoon match with two wins in three games.

RCB have made a promising start but need to improve their fielding and death bowling. Navdeep Saini bowled a tidy Super Over against Mumbai Indians to get his team over the line after RCB leaked as many as 79 runs in the last four overs for the game to be tied.

The Bangalore franchise made three changes in the previous clash and are likely to give those players — Isuru Udana, Adam Zampa and Gurkeerat Mann — another go.

The move to open the bowling with Washington Sundar paid off as the offie returned with figures of 12 for one in four overs in a game where more than 400 runs were scored.

Ab de Villiers has shown ominous touch and it must be heartening for the team management to see Shivam Dube providing the big hits towards the end against Mumbai Indians.

Skipper Kohli is yet to set the tournament on fire and Saturday could be his day.

Squads:

Royal Challengers Bangalore: Virat Kohli (c), AB de Villiers, Parthiv Patel, Aaron Finch, Josh Philippe, Chris Morris, Moeen Ali, Mohammed Siraj, Shahbaz Ahmed, Devdutt Padikkal, Yuzvendra Chahal, Navdeep Saini, Dale Steyn, Pawan Negi, Isuru Udana, Shivam Dube, Umesh Yadav, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Washington Sundar, Pavan Deshpande, Adam Zampa.

172,2020/10/02,Courtney Walsh named head coach of West Indies women’s cricket team,"The West Indies cricket legend will lead the preparation and development of the women’s team at least till the end of 2022, including competing in the next ODI World Cup and T20 World Cup.

West Indies fast bowling great Courtney Walsh has been appointed as the new head coach of the West Indies women’s cricket team.

The West Indies cricket legend will lead the preparation and development of the women’s team at least till the end of 2022, including competing in the next ODI World Cup and T20 World Cup.

Walsh has served as an assistant coach with the Bangladesh men’s team, and subsequently worked on a short term contract with the West Indies women’s side, including at the T20 World Cup held in Australia earlier this year.

Walsh is the highest wicket-taker in West Indies Test history with 519 scalps in 132 matches.

A former Jamaica and West Indies captain, he took 227 wickets in ODIs and 1807 wickets in 429 first-class matches. The 57-year-old is a member of the ICC Hall of Fame.

“It’s an exciting challenge and I’ve always wanted to give back in any way I can and help with the development of the game in the West Indies,” Walsh said in a statement on Thursday.

“The experience I have, my knowledge of the game, and my overall organisational skills will be key aspects as we try to develop a winning team culture.

“I worked with the team at the Women’s T20 World Cup earlier this year in Australia and in the series against India in the Caribbean last year, so I have a very good understanding of what is required.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/y6qkg0/article32750863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COURTNEYWALSH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/courtney-walsh-named-head-coach-of-west-indies-womens-cricket-team/article32750864.ece
173,2020/10/02,Proposal to replace traffic signals awaits State government’s nod,"Maintenance of signals will improve after replacement: Deputy Commissioner

Once the proposal to replace the 51 traffic signals within Coimbatore City Police limits is approved by the State Government, the maintenance of the signals will improve, said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) R. Mutharasu.

Mr. Mutharasu told The Hindu the proposal worth ₹ 4.82 crore was sent by Commissioner of Police Sumit Sharan to the State government in November 2019 and is expected to be approved in the next few months.

“We will have a five-year maintenance contract with the firm that will erect traffic signals,” he said. The traffic signals will be designed with the latest technology available at the time of the proposal’s sanction, according to Mr. Mutharasu.

Coimbatore City Police will also be paying the electricity bills for all the traffic signals once the proposal is sanctioned, he said. After the Madras High Court directed the State government in 2017 that permission should not be granted for installation of advertisement boards at traffic signal posts, various private firms that were maintaining the signals stopped paying electricity bills. The functioning of the traffic signals was ensured after the traffic police approached Tangedco for a temporary arrangement, he said.

Mr. Muthurasu noted that the road safety initiative ‘Uyir’ will be maintaining the 51 traffic signals till the sanction of the proposal.

The initiative has so far erected and maintained 11 traffic signals apart from the existing 51 signals in the Coimbatore City Police limits, he said.

‘No dept. entrusted’

175,2020/10/02,DMK holds makkal sabhai in Tiruppur district,"Resolutions passed against farm legislations

With the State government cancelling the gram sabha meetings amid the rising COVID-19 cases in many districts, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) organised a ‘makkal sabhai’ (People’s sabha) at Thurambadi village panchayat in Mulanur Block of Tiruppur district on Friday. In Coimbatore also, the party members who headed the Vellanaipatti Panchayat held a similar meeting. Both meetings condemned the three farm legislations brought in by the Central Government.

Party sources in Tiruppur said Thurambadi panchayat president C. Shanmugam headed the meeting in which nearly 50 persons, comprising DMK functionaries and residents of Thurambadi, participated.

The sources claimed that all COVID-19 precautionary measures -- wearing of masks, using hand sanitisers and physical distancing --were ensured at the meeting.

When contacted, an official from the Tiruppur District Administration said on conditions of anonymity that this would not be considered a gram sabha. “Parties may conduct such meetings on their own, but the government has cancelled [grama sabha meetings],” he said, refusing to comment further.

The meeting at Vellanaipatti Panchayat in S.S. Kulam Panchayat Union in Coimbatore passed a resolution condemning the Central Government for the legislations and the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in the State for supporting these.

Panchayat president Kavitha and vice-president V.R. Rajan passed the resolution in the presence of DMK’s Coimbatore urban west unit in-charge Payya Gounder alias R. Krishnan and S.S. Kulam union secretary S.P. Sureshkumar.

Though the district administration on Thursday cancelled the gram sabhas citing the COVID-19 pandemic, the DMK asked its members to hold the meeting wherever possible, to pass resolutions against the farm legislations.

Coimbatore district administration officials could not be reached for their comments on the panchayat holding a “gram sabha”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/dmk-holds-makkal-sabhai-in-tiruppur-district/article32755347.ece
176,2020/10/02,Gram sabha could have been held: Vanathi Srinivasan,"Bharatiya Janata Party State vice-president Vanathi Srinivasan said here on Friday that the government could have held the gram sabhas by ensuring personal distancing norms.

Speaking to mediapersons after garlanding Mahatma Gandhi’s statue on Vysial Street here, she said the calling off of the gram sabhas was unnecessary as the spread of COVID-19 was low in rural areas.

Gram sabhas would have been an opportunity for the public to learn about the three new Acts on agriculture reforms, she claimed. Regarding the DMK’s call to pass a resolution against the Acts at the meetings, Ms. Srinivasan said it would not have had any impact on the public.

The leadership tussle in the AIADMK as an “internal problem” and the BJP would not intervene in it, she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/gram-sabha-could-have-been-held-vanathi-srinivasan/article32755330.ece
177,2020/10/02,‘Good that gram sabhas were cancelled’,"Given the rising COVID-19 cases, village panchayat presidents in Tiruppur district were largely appreciative of the State government’s decision to call off the gram sabhas that were to be held on Gandhi Jayanthi on Friday.

President of Kavandachipudur panchayat president R. Selvi said that around 20 persons had tested positive for COVID-19 in her village panchayat. At least 200 persons would have come for the gram sabha, increasing risk of a further spread of the disease, she told The Hindu. Although these meetings were not held, petitions regarding basic facilities from all nine wards in the panchayat were received and action would be initiated, she said.

Iduvai panchayat president K. Ganesan said the State government should have announced the cancellation at least two days ago, and not as late as Thursday evening. Conducting gram sabhas was vital to flagging people’s issues with the government, but the safety of the people was more important, he said, adding that nearly 30 persons had tested positive for COVID-19 in Iduvai village panchayat.

Explore alternatives

K.G. Inbarasan, general secretary of Institute of Grassroots Governance, which focuses on strengthening grassroots democracy, said the State government must explore alternative methods to conduct gram sabhas amid the pandemic. “Ward sabhas could be conducted instead of gram sabhas to ensure less crowding,” he said, giving the example of Odisha where such meetings were held at every ward of a village panchayat. Another option is to conduct virtual gram sabha meetings in village panchayats, he suggested.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/good-that-gram-sabhas-were-cancelled/article32755305.ece

The duty doctor at the centre said the patients were complaining about the food “for the past two days.” The supplier responsible for delivering the food was notified of this issue and the patients called off the protest within an hour, the doctor said.

Tiruppur South Tahsildar P. Sundaram visited the centre on Friday evening to conduct an inquiry.

183,2020/10/02,Trees preferred by vultures for nesting planted in MTR,"With the guidance of the Forest Department, NGO Arulagam plants saplings in Sigur Range

A total of 160 trees, known to be preferred by vultures to build their nests, were planted in the Sigur Range in the buffer zone of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) on Friday.

S. Bharathidasan, secretary of Arulagam, a conservation NGO that has been working on protecting the vulture population in the Sigur plateau, said the saplings of Terminalia arjuna, Terminalia bellerica, Spondias pinnata and Syzigium cumini were preferred by the vultures to build nests.

“These trees grow tall, and as a result, elephants cannot knock off the nests from the top of the trees. They grow near the banks of rivers and streams and are resistant to forest fires as they are close to water sources,” said Mr. Bharathidasan.

The planting was done by Arulagam with the guidance of the Forest Department and help from volunteers from the Government Arts College in Udhagamandalam to mark the 151st birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and the beginning of the Wildlife Week, which is celebrated every year between October 2 and 8.

Mr. Bharathidasan said the Clean India Mission, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, has been gathering pace across the country.

“But at the same time, cleanliness work inside forests is done effectively by vultures, who are very effective scavengers,” he said. He hoped that by linking the role of vultures in the ecosystem to the Clean India Mission, the negative connotations people have about vultures can be lifted.

In a statement, K.K. Kaushal, Field Director of MTR, said the effort of the government and local communities in ensuring the protection of forests in Mudumalai was bearing fruit, as evidenced by the increase in the number of elephants and tigers in the reserve as well as across the country.

The eight western districts have received an above average rainfall from south west monsoon. With the predictions showing a positive sign for the north east monsoon, the farmers and urban water managers can heave a sigh of relief.

In the past, there had been years when the region received below average rainfall during the south west monsoon that just exited. Though Pilloor reservoir, that caters to drinking water needs had surplussed more than once this year, this did not happen in Siruvani, that serves Coimbatore city, despite the rains as Kerala was maintaining the storage below the FRL.

For the second consecutive year, Coimbatore district received excess rainfall during the season from June to September. It has received 269 mm as against the season’s average of 195 mm. And, most of the 269 mm has come in September, says S.P. Ramanathan, head, Agro Climate Research Centre at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.

The district has received over 115mm this September as against the months’ average of 70.7mm. Last year, the district received 308.1mm. And, August 2019 alone brought in 221.3mm and that too in seven rainy days, he says. A day with over 2.5 mm precipitation is accounted for as a rainy day. Meanwhile, the north east monsoon prediction for Coimbatore is again good in that the Centre has said that there may be 318mm rainfall from October to December as against the average of 343.8mm.

According to the District Agro-Meteorology Unit under the Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Salem, Salem will receive an average rainfall of 359 mm during north east monsoon and average rainfall of 351 mm is expected during the monsoon here. During south west monsoon which started in June, an average rainfall of 386.5 mm was recorded till September 24. Namakkal district has received 49 mm excess of average rainfall expected during south west monsoon. According to officials, 340 mm rainfall is expected during the south west monsoon

On Friday, the water level at Mettur dam was 99.62 ft against a total scale of 120ft. The stored capacity of water in the dam was 64,340 mcft and the dam received an inflow of 35,000 cusecs of water. The discharge through Cauvery river was 20,000 cusecs of water and 850 cusecs of water was discharged through East-West canal.

However this year, the South West monsoons brought in 420.38mm of rainfall, in Krishnagiri as compared to the last year’s rainfall of 345.49mm rainfall, way above the annual average. The KRP dam with its storage capacity of 52 feeet has a current water level of 41 feet. Kelavarapalli dam in Hosur with its total storage capacity of 44.28 ft has a current water level of 39.36 ft.

For the second consecutive year, the south west monsoon in the Nilgiris brought intense showers. Scientists from the Indian Institute of Soil and Water Conservation (ICAR-IISWC) in Udhagamandalam, said that there had been “deficient” rainfall during the month of July in both 2019 and 2020 - that is 40 - 60% lesser than the average.

They added that these relatively drier months were followed up by higher quantities of rain over shorter spells of time over the last two years, increasing the chances of landslips and flooding events.The dams in the district are almost at full capacity due to the rains in the district during August and September of this year. According to the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO), most of the dams are above 90% of their total storage capacity.

Southwest Monsoon in Erode district during July and September was normal as most of the areas received rainfall this year. Officials at the Meteorological Department at the Collectorate said that the normal rainfall is 212 mm for the district and so far the district received 217 mm.

Due to rains in the catchment areas, the major reservoir in the district, Bhavani Sagar, received copious water in the past two weeks as water level is inching towards 102 feet. On Friday, water level at the reservoir stood at 101.92 feet against the full reservoir level of 105 feet.

191,2020/10/02,"Maratha quota: anguished by youth’s suicide, Parth Pawar to approach SC","His tweets are not against govt. stance, says NCP’s Jayant Patil

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Parth Pawar raised political eyebrows yet again with tweets expressing anguish over the alleged suicide of a Maratha youth while apparently rebuking his own Maha Vikas Aghadi government for not striving harder to ensure justice for the Maratha community.

Mr. Pawar, the son of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and grand-nephew of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, also said that he would file an intervention application before the Supreme Court over the Maratha reservation.

The Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government on September 21 had already filed an application before the SC seeking to vacate the stay on the implementation of the Maratha quota law in the State.

“Devastated to hear of the tragic death of [the youth from Beed] who committed suicide for the cause of Maratha reservations. Before a chain reaction of such unfortunate incident starts, Maratha leaders have to wake up and fight for this cause. Requesting Maharashtra government to step in to solve the crisis,” Mr. Pawar said in a series of tweets late on Wednesday.

The deceased youth had allegedly written in his suicide note that as the son of a poor farmer, he had been unable to secure a seat after appearing for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test — an exam for medical college aspirants — because the implementation of the Maratha quota law in Maharashtra had been stayed by the apex court.

While senior NCP leader and State Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil said there was no cause to read any ‘anti-government’ sentiment into Mr. Pawar’s tweets, the Pune-based Sambhaji Brigade has lashed out at Mr. Pawar’s sudden solicitousness for the rights of the Maratha community, accusing him of being “politically self-serving.”

Santosh Shinde of the Sambhaji Brigade said, “This is not the first time that a Maratha youth has given his life after reservation was denied. Nearly 50 youths have committed suicide since 2018 in the struggle to secure a quota. Mr. Pawar had never tweeted then. Furthermore, he has never participated even once in the hundreds of Maratha quota agitations.”

Stating that Mr. Pawar’s contribution to the Maratha quota agitation was “literally zero”, Mr. Shinde said that such opportunistic tweets were solely meant to burnish his image and stay relevant in politics.

“Has Mr. Pawar taken part in any street agitation till date? Has he fought side by side with any of the veteran Maratha community leaders? So, I think there is no need for him to give us advice to wake up and fight. Instead, as a young political leader, he ought to have focussed on pressing issues like education and employment that are more germane to Maharashtra’s youth today,” Mr. Shinde said.

He further said that Mr. Pawar’s remarks only prove that all political leaders in the State were using the Maratha quota law for their selfish political ends, as had been their wont throughout the agitation since 2016.

Mr. Pawar, who was the NCP’s candidate for the Maval Lok Sabha constituency in Pune at the time of the 2019 general elections, had suffered a defeat at the hands of the Shiv Sena’s Shrirang Barne in spite of the lobbying and campaigning by his father Mr. Ajit Pawar.

He became the first member of the powerful Pawar clan to lose an election — a defeat made all the more bitter with the resounding victory of his cousin brother Rohit Pawar from Ahmednagar’s Karjat-Jamkhed seat in the Assembly polls in October last year.

Since then, Mr. Pawar has avidly courted political controversy, often taking a line running contrary to the stance of the NCP and the MVA government, be it the Ram Temple construction in Ayodhya or the Sushant Singh Rajput case.

In August, a vexed Mr. Sharad Pawar, in an uncharacteristic admonishment of a member of his family, had publicly slammed his grand-nephew’s actions in the Sushant case while dismissing Mr. Pawar as “immature”.

Commenting on Mr. Pawar’s resolve to file a petition in the Maratha quota issue even after the MVA government had already filed a review petition, Mr. Patil said, “His [Mr. Pawar’s] stance is not anti-government. Instead, he thought he wished file an additional petition in the matter... This does not imply he is against the government’s line in the matter.”

Urging Maratha youth to desist from taking extreme steps and not get disheartened by the SC’s stay, Mr. Patil said that the State government would be strongly presenting its case before the apex court with the best lawyers to serve the Maratha community’s interests.

Meanwhile, the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made capital of the younger Pawar’s statements, saying that it only served to illustrate the inefficiency of Mr. Thackeray’s tripartite government.

“More than embarrassing the ruling government, Mr. Pawar’s tweets illuminate the failure of the MVA in striving seriously for justice for the Maratha community. His tweets were a spontaneous reaction and should not be viewed from a political perspective. He is an upcoming young leader in the State and the government must take cognisance of the suicide by immediately thinking of accommodating students until the apex court vacates the stay,” said Pravin Darekar, the BJP’s Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/44kxfh/article32748102.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BMPARTHPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/maratha-quota-anguished-by-youths-suicide-parth-pawar-to-approach-sc/article32748103.ece
192,2020/10/02,Delhi Mahila Congress chief alleges U.P. police ripped her clothes during protest,"Vrinda Shukla (DCP, Women’s Safety, Noida), however, refutes claim

Newly appointed Delhi Pradesh Mahila Congress (DPMC) president Amrita Dhawan has alleged that her clothes were ripped during a scuffle with the Uttar Pradesh police at the Yamuna Expressway on October 1.

Ms. Dhawan said that the incident occurred when she intervened during the detention of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra en route to Hathras.

Vrinda Shukla, DCP, Women’s Safety, Noida, who was present at the site, refuted the claim. “I was there during the entire demonstration and a large number of women policemen were also on duty. Nothing like this was done against the dignity of any woman by the Noida police,” Ms. Shukla tweeted.

The incident, however, caused outrage on social media, with several Congress leaders and twitter users hitting out at the U.P. police.

Ms. Dhawan said that the incident showed the values of the Modi government at the Centre and the Yogi government in U.P. “If you want to show your strength, show it by dealing with the criminals. What will be achieved by tearing clothes? They need to remember what the disrobing of Draupadi and disrobing of Sita ultimately led to,” Ms. Dhawan said.

Ms. Dhawan was president of the Delhi University Students’ Union in 2006 and has been national president of the NSUI and a media panellist of the Congress.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dq2jsw/article32750426.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMRITADHAWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-mahila-congress-chief-alleges-up-police-ripped-her-clothes-during-protest/article32750427.ece

194,2020/10/02,Theatres await govt. nod to resume shows,"With precautions in place, owners say they are ready for cine-goers

Welcoming the Centre’s decision to permit cinema halls to function with 50% capacity from October 15, associations and management of the theatres urged State governments to take a decision on the same.

The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), however, said in the Capital, “status-quo” would be maintained on cinema halls till October 31 or until further orders.

The Multiplex Association of India (MAI) said permissions on an urgent basis from the State governments to reopen cinemas would go a substantial distance in ensuring that the cinema exhibition sector is able to quickly recover from the economic impact.

Most of the theaters in Delhi are run by large multiplex chains that have a presence across the county and are planning for a pan India opening. However, a few remaining single-screen theaters like Delite Cinema said they were ready to open but they do not know about the “status-quo”.

“We have reburshied our halls during the lockdown. We have upgraded our air conditioning unit and installed a UV chamber for sanitising the air that is being circulated,” said the manager of Delite. Managing Director, Carnival Cinemas, P.V. Sunil said this was the right time to open halls with Diwali around the corner but a couple of State governments are yet to give the nod.

“As of now, our software is being modified in accordance with 50% seating so that the audience have a seamless experience while booking tickets online. Two weeks is sufficient time for our preparations,” Mr. Sunil said.

Alok Tandon, CEO, INOX Leisure, said preparations on the hygiene and disinfection front will set new benchmarks for any public premises, whether inside the auditorium or in our lobbies and F&B counters. “We are positively hopeful that the State governments will now give us the green signal,” Mr. Tandon said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ryd4sb/article32749156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE01LEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/theatres-await-govt-nod-to-resume-shows/article32749161.ece

197,2020/10/02,"Cinema halls, entertainment parks to remain closed in Delhi","State govt. opts for status quo on reopening for now, barring two weekly markets instead of one

The Delhi government has decided to maintain “status quo” on cinema halls, entertainment parks, and swimming pools for sportspersons despite the Central government allowing these to open.

The Delhi Disaster Management Authority, in an order issued on Wednesday night, allowed two weekly markets in each municipal zone every day, up from one such market allowed earlier, on a trial basis till October 31. However, this will not be allowed in containment zones. All activities which are permitted in the city at this point will be allowed to continue.

“The situation of COVID-19 in Delhi has been reviewed and it has been decided that status quo in respect of prohibited/permitted activities (including activities on trial basis) may be maintained in NCT of Delhi till 31.10.2020 or further orders, whichever is earlier,” the DDMA order said.

No word on schools

Though the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in its guidelines on reopening issued on Wednesday gave powers to the States to decide if they wanted to open schools from October 15, there was no word on it in the DDMA order.

The Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to a query on whether the government will review whether to open schools after October 15 or if they will remain closed at least till the end of the month.

Curbs on gatherings

On Wednesday, the MHA had said that the limit of 100 persons in all kinds of congregations, including those that are religious and political, has been removed, and from October 15 States have been given the flexibility to permit such activities outside containment zones.

But the Delhi government has not allowed it at this point. “It is further directed that all social / academic / sports / entertainment / cultural / religious / political functions / other gatherings and large congregations shall be continued to be prohibited throughout NCT of Delhi,” the DDMA order said.

In line with the ‘Unlock 4’ guidelines issued earlier, a maximum 50 people will continue to be allowed in marriage-related gatherings and up to 20 people in gatherings relating to funerals and last rites, subject to social distancing.

200,2020/10/02,"Rai seeks action against thermal plants, brick kilns","Minister recommends bio-decomposer to arrest pollution

Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Thursday said that he has requested Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar to take action against 11 thermal power plants in States close to Delhi and brick kilns in these areas to reduce air pollution during winter.

Mr. Rai recommended Environment Department officials of Punjab and Haryana to use “bio-decomposer” developed by the PUSA Institute in Delhi to decompose crop stubble, which can be later used as fertiliser, instead of burning it.

“Last year, there was zero stubble burning inside Delhi. However, in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Western U.P., massive stubble burning took place last year which contributed to 45% to Delhi’s air pollution,” the Minister said.

Mr. Rai made the recommendations during a meeting Mr. Javadekar held with Environment Ministers and other officials of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan via videoconference on Thursday.

Mr. Rai said: “We have also requested the Central government to intervene and make a timeline within which the thermal power plants of the NCR should obtain new technology and stop the old technology. We have also requested the Central government and the States to push for new technology in the brick kilns of the NCR.”

Centre to test it

Mr. Javadekar said that the Centre will test the technology this year. “This year we will test it in all States, in thousands of hectares, and based on the results we will expand it next year,” he said.

“We have given machines worth ₹1,700 crore to farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.

A young footballer, who has represented India in the international tournaments, approached the Delhi High Court on Thursday challenging the decision of All India Football Federation (AIFF) to bar him from practising with his club because of a rare heart condition.

Twenty-year-old Anwar Ali, in his plea said, he has challenged a September 7 letter written by AIFF to Mohammedan Sporting Club of Kolkata directing it to not allow him to train with the team.

Former JNU student Umar Khalid has been formally arrested in a second FIR in connection with communal riots that broke out in Delhi in February, his friend Banojyotsna Lahiri said.

The arrest was made by the Crime Branch on Wednesday, she said.

Crime Branch officials could not be reached for a comment.

Ms. Lahiri said the arrest was made in FIR number 101 registered at Khajuri Khas police station under Sections of rioting, mischief by fire, criminal conspiracy, among others, that was being probed by a Crime Branch SIT.

Mr. Khalid was interrogated in connection with this case in the first week of September by the Crime Branch.

Ms. Lahiri claimed that the lawyers were unaware of the development.

“Today, just hours before his legal mulaqat, he was whisked away for an appearance before a ‘duty magistrate’ after the arrest in jail. He was told that they would provide him a ‘legal aid counsel’ when he insisted that his ‘legal mulaqat’ was due in a short while. He even named his lawyers and wanted to talk to them via videoconferencing or over the phone. However, he was not provided the facility and nor was his lawyers informed. His remand hearing was done hurriedly with the aim of denying him access to counsel and his family, friends and lawyers and then presented a fait accompli,” she said.

“Punjab policemen told that they were in the security of Punjab Youth Congress (PYC) president Brinder Dhillon, who brought them to Delhi to attend a political event. They were unaware of the protest at India Gate. The policemen also didn’t follow protocol and never informed Delhi Police about their entry into Delhi,” said the officer. He added that they have enough evidences on the presence of Punjab policemen during the protest. A letter has been written to Punjab Police for strict action against them.

On Tuesday, Delhi Police arrested Birender Singh Dhillon and many other IYC members in connection with the tractor-burning incident near India Gate on Monday morning against farm bills.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-police-seek-action-against-4-punjab-policemen/article32748167.ece
206,2020/10/02,Leopard killed in accident on highway,"FIR registered by Forest Department

A male leopard, aged around eight, was killed in a road accident on Gurugram-Faridabad State highway on Wednesday.

A first information report has been registered by the Forest Department in connection with the incident.

The death of the leopard has again put focus on the lack of safety measures on the three highways, including National Highway-48 and Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway, bisecting the corridor used by the wildlife to traverse from Asola Wildlife Sanctuary in Delhi to Sariska in Rajasthan passing through Gurugram (Mangar-Bandhwari).

Though jackals, nilgai (blue bull), mongoose and other wild animals are killed in routine on these highways, at least two leopards died in separate accidents last year. “A leopard had died in a similar manner at the same spot in January last year, while another lost his life in October,” said Vaishali Rana, a wildlife activist.

Wildlife activists have been demanding long that underpasses to be urgently constructed on the three highways to provide passage to the animals to cross the roads. Also, the authorities have been asked several times to build speed barriers and put signages on these highways to caution the drivers about the presence of wildlife and to slow down.

Ms. Rana wrote to Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Wildlife, Alok Verma, on Thursday seeking to know the status of wildlife conservation plan for the highways and how the sanctioned funds were used.

Mr. Verma told The Hindu that the construction of underpasses was taken up with the National Highways Authority of India several times, but there was no favourable response. He added that it would be difficult to stop such incidents unless underpasses were made for the wildlife to cross the roads.

“Citing the present case and the earlier cases as well, we will again take up the matter with the NHAI so that some action can be taken. We will also ask the Public Works Department, Haryana, to put signages and speed barriers on the roads falling under its jurisdiction. We will raise the matter with the State government aggressively,” said Mr. Verma.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/leopard-killed-in-accident-on-highway/article32748163.ece

208,2020/10/02,"Bypoll will be referendum on govt.’s show, says Hooda","‘Result of Baroda bypoll to decide course of future politics’

Former Haryana Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Thursday said that Baroda bypoll was no ordinary election, but would be a referendum on the performance of the State government. He added that the result of the bypoll would decide the course of future politics in the State and a win for Congress shake the foundation of the BJP-JJP government in Haryana.

Mr. Hooda, flanked by several senior party leaders, was addressing a press conference at Sonipat’s Gohana, a day after the Election Commission announced the schedule for the bypoll necessitated due to the demise of Congress MLA Sri Krishan Hooda.

The septuagenarian leader once again challenged Chief Minister Manohar Lal to contest against him in the bypoll.

Challenges CM

“Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar claims to have done many development works in Baroda during six years. If he is so confident, he should accept the challenge of contesting from Baroda. If the Chief Minister contests the elections from Baroda, then I am also ready to contest against him,” he said.

Mr. Hooda, referring to the fallout of the Meham bypoll, said that a single election could overthrow the government. “Just as the Chautala government was ousted from power after Meham, the BJP-JJP government would meet a similar fate after Baroda bypoll,” he said.

The two-time Chief Minister said that the BJP government had ruined Haryana in six years as it had come crashing down from the number one position in investment and development indicators to being number one in crime and unemployment. “Today Haryana’s youth, workers, businessmen, poor labourers and farmers are sliding into hopelessness. In this election, the people of the State will pass a no confidence motion against the government,” he said.

Mr. Hooda said that farmers and youth were the two segments hit hard by the policies of the government. While farmers were out on the streets, the condition of the youth was no different because of high rate of unemployment. He also announced to launch a State-wide tour, after winning the Baroda bypoll, against anti-farmer laws passed by the government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ofgzgr/article32748156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL02-HOODAPIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bypoll-will-be-referendum-on-govts-show-says-hooda/article32748157.ece
209,2020/10/02,Fly ash from thermal plants: NGT rejects plea on order review,"‘Consequences of non-disposal of fly ash on environment, public health well-known’

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has dismissed a plea seeking review of its order, which directed thermal power plants to pay a fine for violation of the Centre’s notification on the utilisation of fly ash that is generated.

A Bench headed by NGT chief Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel observed that consequences of non-disposal of fly ash on the environment and public health were well-known.

“We do not find any distinguishing feature in the present case so as to review the earlier order in favour of the applicant,” the Bench said.

The observations came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by the Chhattisgarh State Power Generation Company seeking review of a February 12 order directing thermal power plants to take prompt action for the scientific disposal of fly ash. The Tribunal had warned of imposition of fines in case of violation.

The NGT had stated that non-compliant thermal power plants would be liable to pay an environmental compensation that would be determined from December 31, 2017, as being the cut-off date.

210,2020/10/02,Congress demands reopening of all weekly markets in city,"Party, street vendors’ unions protest outside Chief Minister’s residence

The Delhi Congress, along with the members of street vendors’ unions, on Thursday protested outside the residence of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, demanding all weekly bazaars be permitted to function across the Capital.

The party said that street vendors have been out of jobs ever since a nationwide lockdown was enforced in the Capital following the outbreak of COVID-19 and are now in a terrible plight as all avenues for them to earn a livelihood are shut.

After being detained by the Delhi police for holding the demonstration, the party said that weekly bazaars not only help street vendors earn a livelihood, but such bazaars also provide all sorts of essential goods at affordable prices to the common people. Delhi Congress chief Ch. Anil Kumar said that the Narendra Modi-led government has been busy passing anti-farmer Bills to help the corporates and the Arvind Kejriwal government, instead of addressing urgent issues like that of the street vendors, was busy playing politics by meddling in the affairs of another State where it has no presence.

“If the Central and the State governments could relax lockdown norms to allow liquor shops, bars, malls, shopping complexes, hotels and other such establishments to operate, then there was no reason to deny the street vendors their right to run the weekly bazaars,” Mr. Kumar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/congress-demands-reopening-of-all-weekly-markets-in-city/article32748138.ece

212,2020/10/02,Govt. using NCPCR to defame me: Harsh Mander,"Child’s right panel raided two shelters that the activist was associated with

Activist and former IAS officer Harsh Mander said on Thursday that the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) had raided two children’s homes in Delhi that he had been associated with in the past with the main aim of finding out if any of the residents had participated in the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Mr. Mander said the NCPCR raid on Thursday at Ummeed Aman Ghar and Khushi Rainbow Home was led by the NCPCR chairperson.

Anti-CAA protests

“I am no longer formally associated with these homes... I visit them [the children] when I can, to assure myself about their welfare, speak to them about the world and leading a good life, and sing songs together. The NCPCR team in its ‘raids’ on the two homes had four central focuses. The most important was whether the children participated in the anti-CAA protests. The second focus was about my association with the homes,” he said in a statement.

The other focuses of the raid was also to find out if there was any foreign funding and if any Rohingya children were living at the homes, he alleged. “As it happens, Ummeed is entirely funded from Indian donors. Khushi also is largely supported by Indian donors, but has some foreign donors as well. The fourth question was whether we had given shelter to any Rohingya children. My colleagues said that for us, we don’t focus on the identity of any child; the only thing important for us is that she or he is homeless and in need of care and protection,” he said.

Mr. Mander said the Centre was using its agencies to carry out a campaign against those who participated in the anti-CAA protests from December 2019 till March this year. “It has been made amply clear by the actions of the state machinery that I am one of those targeted,” he said.

He said the NCPCR had been used by the government to defame him and advance its campaign against protesters and dissenters.

“The NCPCR is India’s apex body for child rights, and is well within its rights to enquire about the welfare of children in any context. But the timing, mode and questions raised by them are unconventional and raise doubts about the motivation of the agency, whether it will be just one more willing tool for the witch-hunt that is ongoing against independent dissenters in India today,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/govt-using-ncpcr-to-defame-me-harsh-mander/article32747975.ece
213,2020/10/02,Worship by yagnas,"Yagas and yagnas are forms of worship that the Vedas prescribe for human beings. The Gita refers to yagnas as the wish-fulfilling mythical cow Kamadenu. Prajapati created men along with sacrifice to establish a mutual dependence between the celestial beings in the different worlds in creation and the human beings on earth. When the celestial beings are worshipped in the yagnas, they bestow their grace on human beings. But though there are yagnas for fulfilment of specific purposes and desires, the Gita advises that these should be done in a selfless manner and dedicated to God without an eye on personal gain, pointed out Sri K. Srinivasan in a discourse.

Janamejaya, Parikshit’s son, is totally shaken at the turn of events in his life following the death of his father under the extraordinary circumstance of a curse. On the advice of Sage Uttanka, he undertakes the performance of a Sarpa Yagna to avenge his father’s death. But due to divine intervention, it is halted midway when Sage Astika arrives at the yaga sala and asks Janamejaya to stop the sacrifice. The snakes that were yet to be summoned to fall in the fire are thus protected. In the Devi Bhagavata narrative it is shown that there is mention of this Sarpa Yaga of Janamejaya long before its actual conduct. Kadru, the mother of snakes once cursed those snakes who had disobeyed her saying that they will die in the Sarpa Yaga of Janamejaya. So these snakes led by Vasuki had then approached Brahma who foretells the birth of sage Astika by whose power they will be delivered from the curse.

There is mention of another story that explains the Sarpa satra yaga as punishment for the snakes. It is held that snakes resided in the deep seas and that once they entered the land they caused distress to the people with their deadly venom.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/worship-by-yagnas/article32754208.ece
214,2020/10/02,Irrigation dept. to give final touches to structure of work units,"Meetings to be conducted from October 5 to 12

As reorganisation of the Irrigation department at administrative posts level, including change of its nomenclature, is under the active consideration of the State government, the department has decided to give final touches to the structure of the organisation at different levels – circle, unit, division and sub-division.

To re-jig the organisational structure at circle/unit level and below, the authorities have planned meetings with Engineers-in-Chief, Chief Engineers and Superintending Engineers from October 5 to 12 to finalise the proposals of attachment and detachment of some units, circles, divisions and sub-divisions with others within the purview of Chief Engineers. Non-technical personal assistants/superintendents of irrigation offices have also been told to attend the meetings.

“The Chief Engineers and Superintending Engineers have been told to attend the meetings with details of sanctioned strength and working strength in their units along with the existing division-wise workload and the proposed division and sub-division wise workload based on the roadmap given by the government,” a senior official of the department told The Hindu explaining the exercise.

The meetings lined up from October 5 to 12 would also finalise the proposals on utilisation of existing divisions/sub-divisions available within their purview including minor irrigation division/sub-division in the reorganised structure. Seniority list of employees, missing data in the human resource management system, list of agreements of works completed and ongoing, both EPC and non-EPC and work agreements on ongoing/completed works to be shared by two or more Chief Engineers would also be finalised during the meetings.

Further, the list of court cases on service matter and works, list of vigilance cases, disciplinary cases, list of pensioners at division, circle, unit offices level and list of pending compassionate and medical invalidation appointments have also been sought from the administrative engineers.

The requirement of lushkars for management of water release at distributory canals level would also be discussed for sending final proposal on the requirement since there were only about 1,300 of them working against the requirement of over 6,500, the officials said.

The proposals finalised at the meetings would be sent to the government for final clearance as part of completing the exercise of reorganisation of the department.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/irrigation-dept-to-give-final-touches-to-structure-of-work-units/article32755132.ece
215,2020/10/02,NHRC takes ‘serious note’ of ‘intimidation’ case,"DGP directed to personally appear before the panel

The National Human Rights Commission took serious note of the Telangana police’s ‘attitude’ in connection with a delay in filing a final action-taken report, and stated that it was issuing a conditional summons to Telangana Director General of Police M Mahender Reddy to personally appear with the relevant documents.

The case in question was that of two officers of the Karimnagar police allegedly intimidating an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protester. As was earlier reported in these columns in December last year, M A Mujeeb, a 37-year-old para-legal activist, was involved in an anti-CAA protest in Karimnagar. Soon after, he was summoned to the one-town police station for a ‘counselling’ session. One of the officers, Mr Mujeeb claimed, described Islam as having the most ‘fanaticism’, and also told him to speak like a ‘true Indian’. Delhi-based lawyer Bilal Anwar Khan represented him at the human rights panel.

The NHRC on October 1 stated that it had taken cognisance of the matter on January 22, 2020, and called for an action-taken report. But, no report was filed. On May 12, 2020, the NHRC gave a ‘last opportunity’ to submit the report. Despite this, no report was filed, it stated.

“The Commission has considered all the material placed on the record. Despite giving last opportunity no report has been submitted till date. The Commission takes a serious note of this non-responsive attitude. Let conditional summons u/s 13 of PHR Act, 1993 be issued against the DGP Telangana. He is directed to personally appear before the Commission on 01.02.2021 at 11 am along with the requisite report,” the NHRC stated.

In case the Commission receives the report a week before the scheduled date, Mr Reddy’s personal appearance in the case ‘shall stand dispensed with’.

President of the National Backward Classes Welfare Association R. Krishnaiah said the State government had removed over 7,700 field assistants working for MGNREGS in March this year, following their strike in support of long-pending demands. Although most of them had been working for implementation of the project for about 15 years, they were not taken back into duties in spite of repeated requests and in the meantime 14 field assistants had committed suicide due to financial problems arising out of job loss.

He sought to know from the government whether it was wrong to go on strike in support of their demands and how far the attitude of the government was justified even after their unconditional call-off of the strike. Stating that going on strike was a democratic and constitutional right of employees, Mr. Krishnaiah said it was natural justice to take them back into duties.

Mr. Krishnaiah reminded the Chief Minister that it was with the help of movements he could become CM and how he could allow removal of employees from their jobs for going on strike. Since a majority of field assistants were not eligible to compete for other jobs due to age, Mr. Krishnaiah sought to know how they should lead their lives now.

217,2020/10/02,Stem cell therapy for blood cancer patients at NIMS,"OP services to be scaled up: Eatala

In a big blessing for blood cancer patients requiring stem cell therapy, the State government has established a Centre for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine in the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS). The facility will particularly help those from the lower strata of the society who cannot afford corporate medical care.

The centre was inaugurated on Friday by Health Minister Eatala Rajender in the presence of NIMS Director K. Manohar and Superintendent N. Satyanarayana. “The centre will provide a ray of hope to blood cancer patients from poor families, those covered under Aarogyashri scheme, requiring stem cell therapy as they would be treated at the centre free of cost,” the Minister saidafter dedicating the stem cell and molecular lab as part of the centre to the people.

With the opening of the stem cell therapy centre, NIMS has grown into one of the major hospitals in the country, Mr Rajender stated samples of blood cancer patients which were sent to Delhi for diagnosis earlier can now be done here itself. The success rate of NIMS in stem cell therapy among kidney and heart transplantation patients was very high, he said, but some services were stopped due to rise in COVID-19 cases. However, all services would be resumed within a week with the COVID spread now under control.

Stating that living with COVID-19 would be a new norm as the society was doing with dengue, viral fever, swine flu and malaria, the Minister said and asserted that as per ICMR statistics, about 40 lakh people in Telangana had developed antibodies to COVID and the fleecing of patients’ families by corporate hospitals in the name of plasma therapy and some costly injections was wrong.

Mr Rajender admitted that COVID treatment in NIMS had impacted the treatment of other patients, particularly those coming in emergency health conditions, and made it clear that outpatient services would be scaled up soon with OP and Critical Care blocks being set up with an investment of ₹250 crore. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao would lay the foundation stone for the new blocks soon to scale up the outpatient services from 2,500 a day in the past to 5,000 a day.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/wo013p/article32755067.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY02-NIMS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/stem-cell-therapy-for-blood-cancer-patients-at-nims/article32755068.ece

Two days ago, it was started with Pallepahad in Toguta mandal when more than 100 persons joined the party in the presence of Finance Minister T. Harish Rao. Pallepahad is one of the villages to be affected by Mallannasagar. The next day, some persons from Vemulaghat joined the party and it was stated that oustees of some villages were in queue to join the party.

In the wake of this, T. Bal Reddy made a posting in WhatsAap group. He urged those interested in joining the ruling party to bring leaders to the village and admit them into the party.

“It’s an appeal to those interested in joining the TRS.

Taking up a letter written by the HC Registrar General on pendency of criminal cases and inadequate number of public prosecutors as a PIL petition, the HC directed the government to fill all vacancies of Public Prosecutors in the State. The State should clearly specify the time period required to recruit public prosecutors, a division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said.

The government should spell out the amount it would allocate to the Department of Prosecution, the ways and means of training PPs (those already appointed and to be recruited). The bench instructed Advocate General B.S. Prasad to present a complete report on the points raised by the bench by October 14.

It requested the AG to interact with all PPs and guide them regularly. The government should seriously think of constructing separate buildings for PPs within court complexes or campuses. It must explain facilities like laptops, software, research engines, ways and means of strengthening communication between investigating officers and PPs, the bench said.

PPs don’t have sufficient infrastructure required for strengthening their professional skills. In many courts, it was found that there was no adequate space for PPs to store files or to accommodate their office, the bench said.

225,2020/10/02,Strange but true: OCTOPUS commandos smoke father killer out of house,"Mentally unstable man hacks father to death with kitchen knife following an argument

A mentally unstable man, who allegedly hacked his father to death at their house in Sriram Nagar Colony in Shankarpally of Ranga Reddy district, was arrested in the late hours of Thursday, in quite a dramatic way. OCTOPUS commandos had to be deployed to nab the accused.

Medari Yadaiah (40), who has been suffering from mental illness for the past several years, used to frequently quarrel with his father Anjaneyulu (60) over petty issues, police said. Since the death of his mother six months ago, Yadaiah was living with his father. His wife and three children had left him a year ago.

On Thursday evening too, he picked up an argument with Anjaneyulu, following which he grabbed a kitchen knife and hit him on the head, which resulted in his father’s instant death, Shamshabad Deputy Commissioner of Police N. Prakash Reddy said.

He said that the offence took place around 6.30 p.m. and neighbours and passers-by alerted Shankarpally police, who rushed to the spot and tried to nab the accused. It took more than five hours for the police to catch Yadaiah as he locked himself inside the house and was moving around wielding the weapon.

In fact, commandos of the Organisation for Counter Terrorist Operations (OCTOPUS) were pressed into service to smoke him out of the house.

“As he could harm himself or others with the weapon, the job to get him out was assigned to the OCTOPUS, who cordoned off the area and hurled smoke grenades inside the house to nab the target,” Mr. Reddy said.

As the entire house was filled with smoke, Yadaiah went to the terrace with the weapon in his hand. Subsequently, the commandos used a water cannon to disarm him, the DCP said. “When the knife fell on the ground, the OCTOPUS commandos who had already surrounded the area, jumped on the terrace and nabbed him,” he said, adding that the operation went on till 1.30 a.m. on Friday.

Later, the accused was arrested and shifted to the Institute of Mental Health at Erragadda.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/strange-but-true-octopus-commandos-smoke-father-killer-out-of-house/article32754879.ece

227,2020/10/02,‘Selfie point’ Durgam Cheruvu bridge turns risky for admirers,"People busy clicking selfies on cable stayed bridge oblivious to zipping vehicles

A 1.5 km drive on a flyover on Jubilee Hills Road Number 45 in Hyderabad gives the first glimpse of the newly-inaugurated cable stayed bridge over Durgam Cheruvu. But once the bridge comes to view, something strange is happening to passengers and drivers.

Some of them slow their vehicles down to a crawl, others are stopping to click photographs, and a few others get busy clicking selfies oblivious to vehicles that might move fast.

“On Wednesday night, a person taking a selfie on the road coming from Mind Space Junction was nicked by a vehicle. It could have been serious,” says a police official standing behind a parked patrol vehicle on the bridge on Friday evening.

Throngs of people with families, couples and young men spilled over from the sidewalk on to the road.

On Thursday night, civic activist Sai Teja shot and posted a chilling video where a couple walk on the bridge and a woman in pink salwar kameez walks to the middle of the three-lane road as vehicles zip around her. Beside the couple two men take photographs and behind them is a parked car with people spilling over and taking photographs.

“The main reason for uploading the video was to show the mindless behaviour of people. It can have tragic consequences for them as well as others,” says Mr. Teja. Immediately after the video was posted on the micro-blogging site, the Madhapur police responded with an appeal: “Our sincere appeal to all the visitors of #DurgamCheruvuCable Bridgenot to come on to traffic lane... Please be in walkway... Be responsible and be safe... and also don’t jump over the railing and don’t take extreme steps for pics and selfies.”

“Traffic is not allowed on the bridge after 11 p.m. and our officials are on the bridge ensuring that traffic keeps moving and people’s safety is taken care of,” said an official at the Madhapur Traffic Police Station.

Traffic is also being restricted by police on weekends on the bridge, according to police officials. In effect, the bridge will be closed for traffic for 89 hours and will be in use by vehicles for 85 hours in a week.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/yxl33a/article32754829.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy02Bridge,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/selfie-point-durgam-cheruvu-bridge-turns-risky-for-admirers/article32754827.ece
228,2020/10/02,Eight arrested for abetting police officer facing corruption case,"They created fake documents for government land

Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officials on Friday arrested eight civilians accused of aiding and abetting former ACP of Malkajgiri, in Rachakonda Commissionerate, Y. Narasimha Reddy, in fraudulent sale and purchase of 1960 square yards of government land in Madhapur.

ACB Deputy Director M. Ramana Kumar said the 1,960 square yards of land had a current market value of ₹50 crore. Four of the accused, Gopagoni Sajjan Goud, Poreddy Thirupathi Reddy, Yerra Chandrashekhar and Arjula Jaipal created gift deeds on their names using fictitious house numbers and wrong PTIN numbers.

Their respective fathers had no ownership title of the land (four plots each of 490 square yards). Yet they created documents claiming their fathers gifted them the plots and got those gift deeds registered in 2016. Investigation by ACB sleuths revealed that they did not mention survey numbers of the land, which was in prohibitory list under Section 22-A(1) (a) of the Registration Act-1908 as it belonged to government.

The four plots were actually allotted by the government to Andhra Pradesh Industrial and Infrastructure Corporation, Hyderabad Urban Development Authority and other government organisations. Two years later, Y. Narasimha Reddy purchased these four plots on the name of his wife Y. Manga for a price of ₹80 lakh. Though the government value of those four plots was ₹6 crore, it was shown as ₹4 crore in the registration documents. The other four accused Madhukar Sri Ram, Bandi Chadra Reddy, Bathini Ramesh Alluguvelly Srinivasa Reddy helped Y. Narasimha Reddy, who is facing disproportionate assets case and lodged in Chanchalguda prison, acquire the 1,960 square yards of land, Mr. Ramana Kumar said.

230,2020/10/02,Dance guru V.S. Ramamoorthy no more,"The centenarian’s birthday celebrations were held last year with fanfare by the dance fraternity

Veteran Bharatanatyam dancer, guru and founder of Hyderabad-based Sri Rama Nataka Niketan, V.S. Ramamoorthy passed away at the age of 100 in Hyderabad on Friday.

Born on September 20, 1920, in Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu, Ramamoorthy moved to Secunderabad in 1969 and made the twin cities his home.

After completing his diploma in electro-technical engineering, Ramamoorthy moved to the erstwhile Calcutta and then to Bangalore to join Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, as a sub-divisional officer. In 1942, he joined Military Engineering Services (MES) and was posted in Madras.

It was Bharatanatyam though that he was most inclined to and became the first male student of the then eminent guru Dandayudhapani Pillai. He gave his Arangetram at Rasika Ranjani Sabha in Madras on Independence Day, at the age of 27.

Ramamoorthy was drawn to dance initially by the tradition of ‘Kathakalakshepam’ and narratives from the Ramayana and Bhagavatam. His portrayal of Sivakami, Kundavi in Parthiban Kanavu, Anarkali, Sita, Kaikeyi, Kousalya, Thilakavathy and many historical female characters in dramas enhanced his acting prowess. Going beyond Bharatanatyam, Ramamoorthy trained himself in Kurathi dance — a folk tradition of Tamil Nadu.

What started as Sri Devi Nritya Niketan to teach dance to children in Mylapore area in Madras, continued as Sri Rama Nataka Niketan in Hyderabad when Ramamoorthy had to move on a job transfer.

Under the guidance of his daughter Manjula Ramaswamy, the institute had won accolades and wide acclaim for its pure and traditional art form. Till his last, Ramamoorthy was actively involved in his students’ performances and used to take pride in their achievements at various platforms.

A few months ago the classical dance fraternity was abuzz with activity celebrating Ramamoorthy’s centenary year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/uug7ny/article32751440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym03V-S-Ramamoorthyjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/dance-guru-vs-ramamoorthy-no-more/article32751435.ece

Detection of COVID-19 raises concerns among patients and their family members, especially if the patient is old. But, the number of old people admitted at Gandhi Hospital who have recovered from the infectious disease gives a ray of hope.

Out of the 4,869 patients who were discharged from the hospital between July and September fourth week, 47% are above 50 years. Most of them had co-morbidities such as diabetes and hypertension, among others.

While 1,042 belong to the age group of 51 to 60 years, 802 were 61 to 70 years old, and 328 were 71 to 80 years old. Those who have recovered from COVID-19 includes 10 people above 90 years also.

Significant number of children too have won over the infectious disease: 106 of the recoveries were recorded in the age group of 1 to 10 years.

Nodal officer for COVID-19 at Gandhi Hospital T. Prabhakar Reddy said that patient care providers attend to the aged. “Some of them do not have the energy to take a tablet out of a strip, or open the cap of packaged food. Our patient care providers help them out,” he said. Video calls are arranged for patients to speak with their family members.

The hospital administration continues to encounter issues with some people who are not ready to take back their old family member post recovery. The members request the hospital authorities to let such old people be there for some more days citing lack of space or care-givers at home.

234,2020/10/02,Telangana insists on speedy release of IGST dues,"Harish wants GoM to recommend the issue to GST Council

Reiterating the State’s demand for immediate release of Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) dues to the tune of ₹2,638 crore, Finance Minister T. Harish Rao has requested the GST Council to ensure that the Central government takes steps to pay ₹25,058 crore IGST dues to the States with immediate effect.

The Minister said there was no objections over the quantum of funds pending release by the Centre and there was clarity on the dues payable to each State.

The Group of Ministers (GoM)should raise the issues in the forthcoming meeting of the GST Council slated on October 5 recommending immediate release of dues.

Mr. Harish Rao made this requests while participating in a video conference of the GoM on Thursday.

Finance Ministers of Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Delhi were present at the video conference which discussed the issues relating to IGST settlement.

‘Violation of norms’

Mr. Harish Rao expressed concern that the Centre had credited the amount due to the States in the Consolidated Fund in violation of norms.

The same was pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General in its report.

The CAG, in its report tabled in the Parliament, highlighted the issue stating that the violation was observed in the financial year 2017-18 and it was repeated the next fiscal too.

Since the CAG, the highest audit body, faulted the government, the GoM should recommend release of dues to the States and ensure that the issue formed part of the agenda of the GST Council meeting.

GoM convener and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi readily accepted the suggestion and directed the officials concerned to forward a recommendation to this effect to the GST Council.

The Minister recalled that the State was yet to get ₹1,000 crore towards settlement based annual returns and steps should be taken to release this amount without any delay.

237,2020/10/02,"1,176-km road stretch in Hyderabad up for private sanitation","Contract agency to sweep roads at least once every day, besides ensuring door-to-door collection

The GHMC standing committee has, during its meeting on Thursday, approved a proposal to be sent to the government, towards handing over the sanitation responsibilities on commercial stretches in the city to private agencies on contract basis.

However, tenders have been called for the proposal already, even before it received stamp of approval from the standing committee and government. As per the proposal, a total of 1,176 km of commercial stretches in 30 circles will be handed over for private sanitation, with an estimated expenditure of ₹215 crore per annum. A provision has been included for raising the cost by five per cent every year, for three years, subjective to the condition that administrative sanction shall be obtained every year. The expenditure will be chargeable to GHMC budget.

Commercial stretches in each zone have been identified by the zonal commissioners. Once the private sanitation begins, all the commercial complexes and shops should have two garbage bins for dry and wet trash. For public use, two bins of 50 to 60 litres capacity should be placed every 100 metres by the contractor. The contract agency should sweep the roads at least once every day, besides ensuring door-to-door collection. The waste thus collected should be transported in a closed container vehicle with partition for wet and dry trash.

Additional number of sweepings and garbage collection on any stretch will be decided based on the need. In order to monitor the waste collection centrally, QR code will be provided for each shop, which the agency should scan every day and upload through an app. Mayor Bonthu Ram Mohan has instructed the officials to ensure that the charges presently being collected by the Swachh Auto Trolley drivers are deposited in the GHMC’s account. Littering of the roads under contract will attract penalty from the Enforcement department. The GHMC sanitation workers presently on these stretches will be transferred to other areas.

The standing committee meeting has also cleared proposal to press into service 650 more Swachh autos on driver-cum-owner to streamline garbage collection. Mr.Ram Mohan has directed the officials to get servicing and body remodelling for the existing Swachh autos. He also asked them to rationalise the existing autos zone wise, to ensure garbage collection even in remote colonies. One more proposal receiving stamp of approval was to deposit ₹5.23 crore with the South Central Railway for construction of a limited height sub-way between Sitaphal Mandi and Arts College stations near Manikeshwari Nagar. The committee has cleared proposals to appoint dependants in place of the deceased outsourcing workers in the Sanitation department, and to replace the old and infirm workers. Besides, it has sanctioned the removal of the workers who have been in absence without leave for over a month.

238,2020/10/02,Kudumbasree unit revitalises a community,"Their work was recognised recently when the Ramamangalam CDS was adjudged the best Kudumbasree CDS in Pampakkuda block with a cash award of ₹2 lakh.

In the three years since a new team took over the reins of the Community Development Society, the Kudumbasree in Ramamangalam along the eastern suburbs of Ernakulam district has turned into a model venture with the number of initiatives more than tripling from a previous 11 to 36.

Their work was recognised recently when the Ramamangalam CDS was adjudged the best Kudumbasree CDS in Pampakkuda block with a cash award of ₹2 lakh.

When the 14-member team led by CDS Chairperson Sheeba Yohannan steps down a little over three months from now, on completion of its term, it would be leaving a lasting legacy tough to match up to.

""We started off by building a house for a destitute at an investment of ₹4.50 lakh, which we mobilised with the help of the panchayat and private sponsors. Our construction team of 20 members then went on to build a house for a scheduled tribe family under the LIFE Mission and did countless house maintenance works for the poor and destitute,"" said Ms.Yohannan.

The Ramamangalam CDS spread over 13 wards comprises 139 Neighbourhood Groups accounting for around 2400 members.

In keeping with the government's campaign to turn fallow land fertile, the CDS started cultivating paddy on 28 acres of land that was lying fallow. ""Our brand of rice, Mamalasserry Rice, is now very popular and we distribute 150-200 kilograms of it to the Kudumbasree Bazar ar Kolancherry every week,"" said Ms. Yohannan.

Besides, the CDS runs a value added chips unit by procuring banana and tapioca from the Kudumbasree joint agriculture groups. A hotel is also being run that serves lunch for as little as ₹20 while a citizen service centre offers online services.

Mushroom, dairy farming and poultry farms are some of the other initiatives. While only 30 families received subsidised support for poultry farms, the CDS helped another 75 families by facilitating bank loans.

The CDS also operates a Gender Resource Centre to help fight atrocities against women and children. ""The centre has handled around 70-80 cases so far. It also offers counselling service twice a week and free PSC coaching for children from poor families,” said Ms.Yohannan.

The team also revived the previously dormant distribution of kits of essential items to the eligible. Now 106 families benefit from the kits valued at ₹500, ₹700 and ₹900 depending on the number of members in the beneficiary families.

""We were active through the lockdown and beyond by supplying life saving medicines at doorsteps and have distributed sanitisers to every household,"" said Ms. Yohannan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/5fg9lc/article32751649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KUDUMBASREEKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kudumbasree-unit-revitalises-a-community/article32751650.ece

He said the pier caps, girders and deck of Palarivattom flyover could have been rebuilt by now, but for contractor bodies approaching the HC seeking load test. He called to end what he termed as a malicious campaign against the reconstruction of structures .

The Government had in September revised the deadline to complete the twin six lane flyovers at Vyttila and Kundannur as December. This was in the wake of the Covid crisis and delay being encountered in completing applying mastic asphalt layer on the two structures.

Official sources said that works to repair potholes on either side of the Palarivattom flyover will be completed tonight.

240,2020/10/02,Online art show in Gandhi’s honour,"A total of 200 works by 120 artists will be part of the exhibition being curated by T. A. Satyapal.

“They are afraid of the spectre of Gandhi because they shot him or Gandhi did not commit suicide” is the theme of an online exhibition inaugurated after midnight on Thursday on the occasion of the 150th birth anniversary of the Mahatma on Friday.

A total of 200 works by 120 artists will be part of the exhibition being curated by T. A. Satyapal. Artists whose works will be on display include Riyaz Komu, Hem Jyotika, Shyamili Chaliha, Bharvi Trivedi, and Shyam Sharma, said Mr. Satyapal.

He said that the online exhibition in the times of the pandemic was a memorial for the Mahatma by the White Rose Movement against violence and war.

Those who killed the Mahatama were not only afraid of his ghost but also of anyone who thought and dreamt.

The exhibition was an expression of anger against Gandhi’s killing, he said. The exhibition was inaugurated by the well-known scholar, Dr. G. N. Devy, and Dr. Kalankumar Chakrabarty presided.

241,2020/10/02,City to use hi-tech app to mitigate waterlogging,"Software will record major sites of flooding, enabling real time efforts to address issue

For a city notorious for inundation in a single spell of strong showers, an app to map the flood-prone areas and undertake targeted mitigation measures with technological aid cannot have come a day earlier.

The Flood Free Kochi App, which was launched by Mayor Soumini Jain, does precisely that. The app has been jointly developed by the Kochi Corporation in association with German International Co-operation Agency (GIZ). It is part of a global program “ICT-based Adaptation to Climate Change in Cities” (ICT-A) being implemented by GIZ.

The app is designed to collect data from multiple locations in the city limits experiencing waterlogging and runs on both Android and iOS platforms. It can be a technological tool for both residents and visitors to the city to report waterlogging to the authorities. It envisages both the general public and officials as volunteers for efficient intervention.

The app will accurately drainages, and man-made or natural obstructions to the flow of water, enabling timely maintenance ahead of rainfall to prevent urban flooding.

Additional services will be bundled into the app in due course. The crowd reporting application empowers any citizen to report flood-affected areas and volunteers assisted by Global Positioning System can intervene to address the problem. The Geographic Information System also offers an insight into the affected area’s uniqueness, population, and topography.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/f69vqi/article32748505.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03KI-FLOODS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/city-to-use-hi-tech-app-to-mitigate-waterlogging/article32748507.ece

A theft accused who had jumped custody while being kept at the detention centre of the jail department at Karukutty was nabbed from Palarivattom bypass with an allegedly stolen motorcycle in the early hours on Thursday. The arrested was identified as Mishal, 23, of Kathiroor in Kannur district. He had allegedly stolen the motorcycle from within the Infopark station limits.

He had managed to escape from the detention centre along with another notorious accused, Suresh aka Dracula Suresh, in the early hours of September 26.

Mayor Soumini Jain denied allegations that the local body had failed to set up sufficient number of First Line Treatment Centres in the city.

A left legislator had alleged that the civic administration had failed to provide the required facilities for the patients. According to Ms. Jain, the civic body had set up the COVID-19 treatment and management facilities as instructed by the authorities. Handwash facilities were set up and masks and sanitisers distributed. Fumigation and cleaning drives were also carried out besides setting up food distribution points, she said.

Five community kitchens were set up in the city and 1,000 food packets were distributed each day from these centres. The civic administration also set up 17 community kitchens as instructed by the State government, she said.

The local body would open more centres before October 7. The centres would be set up at A. J. Hall, Kaloor; St. Francis Church Hall, Kaloor; community hall, Palluruthy; and Pandit Karuppan Hall, Eda Kochi. A formal communication would be send to the district collector in this regard shortly, she said.

245,2020/10/02,Remains of demolition debris still lying at site: SLMC,"Panel to issue directive to Maradu Municipality

The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has found that the remains of the demolition debris scooped out from the nearby Vembanad lake were still lying at the demolition site of the Alfa Serene apartment.

The committee will soon issue a directive to the Maradu municipality to remove the soil and bricks without delay. “I had visited the site on Wednesday to take stock of the situation and it was found that the remains of the debris from the lake removed through dredging were remaining at the site. The chances of the soil and other waste flowing into the waterbody owing to the rain were high,” said A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, Chairman of the SLMC.

The Southern Bench of the NGT had directed the SLMC chairman to monitor the removal of debris and submit an independent report before October 28. In its order issued on August 11, the bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta had asked the committee constituted to monitor the removal of the debris as per the provisions of the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016 to file its report within two months. The Maradu Municipality was also told to produce documents on the action taken to remove the demolition debris that fell into the lake before the State Pollution Control Board and the technical committee.

The municipality had used dredgers to remove the debris that fell into the Vembanad waters, following the tribunal’s order.

Fishermen in the region had lodged a complaint before the SLMC that their fishing nets were damaged owing to the presence of the concrete debris.

Investigations by the board revealed that the debris had fallen at a stretch of approximately 15 metres towards the middle of the backwaters.

The SLMC chairman has received complaints from nearby residents that the open access to the Alfa Serene demolition site has resulted in the entry of miscreants, especially during the night hours. The entry to the site was restricted using an entrance gate. But residents pointed out that the gate was now remaining open after the debris from the lake was removed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/remains-of-demolition-debris-still-lying-at-site-slmc/article32748441.ece
246,2020/10/02,Akshaya to crack whip on unauthorised centres,"District project office to approach Collector with entrepreneurs’ petitions

The Akshaya District Project Office is set to crack the whip on unrecognised citizen service centres, which are posing existential threats to authorised Akshaya centres by eating into their business.

The mushrooming of such centres has for long been a grouse of Akshaya entrepreneurs with many of them coming up right next to Akshaya centres in myriad names that exuded an air of official recognition, misleading the public.

Though a government order was circulated among local bodies not to allow such centres, it was of little use.

“We are now planning to collect individual petitions from all our 256 Akshaya entrepreneurs complete with the number of such unauthorised centres in their neighbourhood and put up a file before the District Collector seeking action. This is the only feasible course of action since we cannot conduct any inspection on our own while petitioning the police is not practical either,” said Vishnu K. Mohan, District Project Manager (Akshaya), Kerala State IT Mission.

Open portal

These centres thrive by illegally tapping into the open portal on which members of the public are allowed five logins a month for availing online citizen services on their own without depending on Akshaya centres.

“Though that provision is not supposed to be used commercially, these centres do precisely that. There is the greater risk of data privacy breach as they resort to unauthorised use of credentials like Aadhaar card of customers for multiple logins without their knowledge,” said M.P. Chackochan, an entrepreneur of 15 years’ standing from Pattimattom.

There had even been instances in which operators of such illegal centres approached Akshaya entrepreneurs seeking unauthorised sharing of customer credentials for ₹50 to ₹100 per customer data.

“Having built trust over the years, Akshaya centres will often have some rush at any point, prompting many to approach these illegal centres to save time. But these centres charge fees arbitrarily and neither are they accountable for their service. Only recently, one customer came to me pleading to rectify the faulty application for a scholarship made by one of these centres while another centre at Chakkaraparambu vanished overnight after collecting money from people by offering to facilitate encumbrance,” said Sini George, a woman entrepreneur near Palarivattom.

No screening

While Akshaya entrepreneurs are cleared after a written exam and interview, no such qualification screening exists for opening such illegal centres.

They have added to the woes of Akshaya centres already hit by the proliferation of the Central government-approved Common Service Centres predominantly meant for various Central schemes but which invariably strays into other services in due course.

Delayed receipt of payments for services, unreasonably low service charges and incurrence of extra expenses for complying with COVID protocol have all exacerbated the survival challenges of Akshaya centres.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/akshaya-to-crack-whip-on-unauthorised-centres/article32748439.ece

249,2020/10/02,Rural police flooded with complaints of fake FB accounts,"Stolen pictures from real profiles being used for setting up fake ones

The Ernakulam Rural police are being flooded with complaints about fake Facebook accounts.

Nearly 250 such plaints were received in the last eight months alone.

Stolen pictures from real accounts are being used for setting up fake accounts in most cases. The accounts rival the original ones in their make and government servants and women often fall prey to them.

It starts with fake account holders striking friendships with their gullible victims, the police said. The seemingly innocuous and friendly chat then descends into a torrential flow of vulgar messages.

“By the time, the victims realise their folly, it would be too late. We have received too many complaints and in most cases we have been able to find some solutions,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural).

Fake charity

Similar frauds are also being conducted in the guise of charity. A trend of forging Facebook accounts of government servants in seeking donations for charity has caught up. The ploy is to trap victims by selling them the trust worthiness of government servants.

Many such accounts have been forged, including that of senior officers. Many have fallen for the trap and lost money, the police said.

The hacking of accounts of government employees is also rife.

“Often the accounts of those who use their mobile numbers as passwords are being hacked into. It is imperative to use stronger and safe passwords,” said Mr. Karthik.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/641gac/article32748413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/facebookki02,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/rural-police-flooded-with-complaints-of-fake-fb-accounts/article32748414.ece

251,2020/10/02,Dismantling of Palarivattom flyover deck begins,"Steel barricades to regulate traffic being readied at site

The work to dismantle the crack-ridden Palarivattom flyover, which began earlier this week, gained pace on Thursday evening with the crucial work to dismantle the structure’s deck.

A chunk of the concrete deck was cut using diamond cutters and removed using crane. It is estimated that it will take three days to cut the deck portion atop each girder. This will be followed by dismantling of girders. Officials associated with the flyover work refused to confirm whether a pair of girders of the existing structure will be retained. Girders numbering 100 will be dismantled.

Work to dismantle the crash barriers on either side of the flyover began on Wednesday, followed by that to break the divider that separated the two sides of the flyover on Thursday morning.

Sources in Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (DMRC) and Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS) said that dismantled concrete will be stored in the space below the flyover and crushed to small pieces, before being transported to the pre-casting yard in Kalamassery. Pier caps and girders to reconstruct the flyover will be cast at the yard and transported to the site in trailer lorries, for being launched atop the existing structure’s piers. Traffic movement was not disrupted, even as these works were under way.

Steel barricades to regulate traffic when more areas are dismantled are being readied at the site. The DMRC had said that work spaces will be covered using barricades and nets, to prevent debris or even water that is used while cutting, to fall on road users.

ULCCS sources said that barricades will be installed when a considerable length of the flyover is pulled down.

In the meantime, traffic police officials said that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has been directed to repair all potholes beside the flyover. Motorists are often caught unawares by dozens of potholes that dot the road beside the structure, on the southern side of the Palarivattom bypass junction. Similarly, DMRC would ready U-turns on either side of the flyover and install lights, to enable traffic diversion when the area beneath the flyover’s central spans is closed for vehicles.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/6soomu/article32748385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02KIBRIDGE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/dismantling-of-palarivattom-flyover-deck-begins/article32748386.ece
252,2020/10/02,"With seats reserved for women, male politicians scramble for safe areas","37 seats earmarked for women to contest in upcoming polls to Kochi Corporation

Prominent male politicians in the city are scrambling for safe seats to contest in the upcoming civic polls as their sitting seats have been reserved for women.

The 50% women reservation system followed in the local bodies of the State would earmark 37 seats for women to contest in Kochi Corporation. In the process, the seats that were open in the general category during the last election have become reserved seats.

The sitting seats of prominent councillors, including Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar; Standing Committee chairpersons P.M. Harris, P.D. Martin and Johnson Master; and LDF leaders K.J. Antony, V.P. Chandran, Benedict Fernandez; former Standing Committee chairpersons A.B. Sabu and K.V.P. Krishnakumar, have been reserved for women in the upcoming elections.

Mr. Premakumar, who now represents the Konam division in the council, may move to Perumbadappu, from where he won the 2010 election. It was Mr. Premakumar who first recorded a UDF victory in the division, which was once considered as the stronghold of LDF.

Mr. Harris, the representative of Kaloor North, may try his luck from the nearby Pottakuzhi division, which was represented by CPI leader Shakkeer in 2010. As the division was reserved for women in 2015, CPI fielded Jamini, who won the division for the front. This time, Mr. Shakkeer may return to the division to contest.

Congress councillor M.B. Muralidharan may shift to Padivattom division, which is located close to the Vennala division, which he is representing in the council. Mr. Muralidharan had won the Padivattom seat too, earlier for the Congress.

LDF leader K.J. Antony may have to look for new seats if the party decides to field its veteran leader one more time to the council. He had earlier represented the Fort Kochi-Veli division. It would be a tough call for the CPI(M) if it decides to field Mr. Chandran to seek mandate again as almost all the seats in the Champakkara area have become reserved seats. It’s also the case with Mr. Sabu as no general seats are available for him to contest from his home turf. Mr. Sabu and Mr. Chandran may have to leave their home grounds and move to the central city areas in search of seats. The availability of seats for these senior councillors outside their domain would depend upon on a host of social and political factors. It is to be seen how many senior men would succeed to get a seat to contest in the election, which may be held by the year-end.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/with-seats-reserved-for-women-male-politicians-scramble-for-safe-areas/article32748358.ece
253,2020/10/02,GIFT City: residents express concern,"Ayampuzha panchayat representatives meet govt. officials

Ayampuzha panchayat representatives, who met State government officials here on Thursday, expressed concern over takeover of residential areas for the proposed GIFT City project in the panchayat.

They also conveyed their anxiety over the impact of the project on the environment as well as loss of cultivable land.

Industries Additional Chief Secretary Alkeshkumar Sharma and District Collector S. Suhas assured the Ayampuzha panchayat representatives, led by president Neethu Anu, that people’s concerns would be addressed.

Mr. Sharma said that the project involved building a cosmopolitan city, which would be implemented taking the views of people into consideration.

The District Collector assured the meeting that it would be a non-polluting venture and that the upcoming social impact study would address the concerns expressed by people. He told residents of the panchayat not to be fooled by land brokers or middlemen and to approach the government directly for any clarification.

Protest staged

At the same time, a group of panchayat residents under the banner of Janakeeya Munnetta Samiti staged a protest against the project before the meeting venue in Kaloor. Bijoy Cherian of the Samiti said it was not justifiable to evict farmers and poor people for a venture that would serve the richer sections of society.

He said that more than 270 families would have to be evicted if the present land takeover plan was implemented. Some of these families would be facing the second eviction in their lives because they had been rehabilitated in Ayampuzha after the land takeover for the Edamalayar project, he saidShaju Parappally, member of the panchayat, said that around 95 families would have to be evicted from ward 9, which he represented. He said that there was great concern about the environmental impact as well as eviction of people for the project.

254,2020/10/02,Karat Faizal let off after 36-hour interrogation,"The investigating team pointed out that he was not given a clean chit and will be called again for questioning, if required.

Customs Department on Friday let off Karat Faizal, a Left Democratic Front (LDF)-backed independent councillor of Koduvally municipality in Kozhikode district, after interrogating him for nearly 36 hours in connection with its probe into the diplomatic gold smuggling case.

The investigating team pointed out that he was not given a clean chit and will be called again for questioning, if required. Mr. Faizal’s lawyer denied his client’s involvement in the case.

He was the first LDF leader to be picked up by the investigating agency in connection with the gold smuggling case. Mr. Faizal was taken into custody based on the statements of some of the accused, including K. T. Rameez.

He had hit the news in 2017 when Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, CPI (M) State Secretary, travelled in his luxury car during the Jagratha Yatra at Koduvally. The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence had named Mr. Faizal an accused in a case of smuggling 6 kg gold through the Calicut international airport in 2013.

255,2020/10/02,Gold smuggling thrives at Calicut airport,"Bhatkal-based gangs found shifting contraband in Vande Bharat Mission flights

Despite strict enforcement, smuggling of gold from GCC cities, especially Dubai, is continuing unabated at the Calicut International Airport.

Sources said the gangs based at Bhatkal, a coastal Karnataka town, are using the airport for shifting staggering amounts of contraband in the Vande Bharat Mission flights. “Numerous cases of smuggling of gold, either in ornaments or in compounds, have emerged at the airport. Incidentally, gangs try to smuggle gold in small amounts and later pool for selling,” an official said.

Dubai-based smuggling syndicates have been operating at Mangaluru, Kannur and Calicut airports for smuggling high-valued contraband notwithstanding air travel restrictions. Smuggling gold in small quantities has been detected earlier also when the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence seized 2.5 kg of the yellow metal from 10 passengers at Mangaluru,” he added.

The changing modus operandi, the official said, was that seizure of small quantities of gold did not attract huge penalties and was also considered a non-bailable offence. “On Wednesday, three persons from Bhatkal attempted to smuggle gold in small quantities of 200 gm each. However, gold concealed in any form will be confiscated. Usually, the contraband is detected in powdered form and mixed with gum or chemical paste. Many cases include concealing gold inside undergarments and also in private parts and body cavities,” he said.

The lockdown has prompted smugglers to adopt new concealment tactics. “One of the passengers flying down from Dubai was arrested for concealing gold behind the exhalation valve of his (KN-95) face mask. He was also a native of Bhatkal,” the official said.

Recent cases also revealed that gold is smuggled from Saudi Arabia and Qatar as well. Smugglers try to exploit every possibility to employ stranded Indians returning, including families from GCC nations, to bring gold to the State. “Earlier, carriers used to travel to Dubai on a 10-day trip. Now, such strategies are not resorted to following travel restrictions. Even then, smuggling of gold via the Calicut airport is the highest among the four airports in the State,” he said.

Gold jewellery does not attract customs duty for the permitted limit (₹50,000 and ₹1 lakh for male and female passengers respectively) and that too of their minimum one-year stay in a foreign country. However, passengers will be arrested if the value of the gold is above ₹20 lakh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/gold-smuggling-thrives-at-calicut-airport/article32748444.ece
256,2020/10/02,Online adalat for senior citizens held,"Most complaints pertain to welfare pension distribution

On the occasion of International Day of Older Persons on Thursday, the Maintenance Tribunal for Senior Citizens held an online adalat in the district.

Assistant Collector G. Priyanka, who is also the presiding officer of the tribunal in Kozhikode, chaired the adalat in which 25 complaints were considered.

Officials said a majority of complaints were related to distribution of welfare pensions. There were also senior citizens who submitted complaints with the tribunal about the unsatisfactory service by the Civil Supplies Department.

Though the adalat was mainly hosted to consider complaints on maintenance claims, no one turned up with such petitions. Officials said such complaints, if any, would be considered again through the district-level helpline number. Till date, the tribunal received eight complaints related to maintenance, they added.

During the lockdown too there were separate sittings to address the grievances of senior citizens. Officials said three such special sittings were arranged in Kozhikode district alone under the Maintenance Tribunal.

“In Kozhikode district, there are 2,70,000 senior citizens who currently benefit from various special welfare schemes. Many of them get regular medical check-up support, free medicine, legal aid, and counselling assistance,” said a Social Justice Department official.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Vijayan said, “Though the project was approved in 2005, it was completed by the LDF government crossing all technical hurdles.” According to him, the project, which was completed at a cost of ₹66.7 crore, will offer more safety to fishing boats, besides improving local fishers’ trade. “Even during adverse climates, they will be able to function safely,” he observed.

Presiding over the function, Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma said the construction of the wharf and the parking area was the most complicated part of the project. “We had to fill a waterlogged area for realising the parking facility,” she recalled.

Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran who unveiled a plaque said the project would help local fishers operate more boats safely, thus increasing their income. “We executed this project with farsightedness, and it will be visible in the days to come,” he noted.

Koyilandy MLA K. Dasan, Municipal Chairman K. Sathian, and heads of various local self-government bodies were present. Fisheries Department officials said the new amenities such as clean auction halls, store rooms, and parking space would offer a better ambiance for local fishers.

BJP protests

Meanwhile, a section of BJP and Bharatiya Yuva Morcha activists staged a protest at the harbour, alleging that Union Minister V. Muraleedharan was not invited to the inaugural function. They claimed that the project became a reality with the Centre’s assistance. Some of them waved black flags during the inaugural ceremony.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/cc8pab/article32748105.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02-KI-HARBOURjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/cm-opens-renovated-koyilandy-fishing-harbour/article32748106.ece
258,2020/10/02,QR code-based visitor registration service a non-starter,"Large supermarkets and shopping centres in city found ignoring the e-based monitoring system

The QR code-based visitor registration service jointly introduced by the National Informatics Centre and IT Mission on the official COVID-19 Jagratha portal was launched to end manual registration using pen and paper at shops and other commercial establishments. But the service, originally an initiative of the Kozhikode district administration, appears to be a non-starter.

While the service is under implementation in some districts, it is yet to be explored by a majority of traders here. Despite a steady spike in the number of COVID-19 cases, large-scale shopping centres and supermarkets in the city have been ignoring the e-based monitoring process, which can effectively help the authorities track the primary contacts of patients and put them in quarantine.

Though the QR code generation feature has been available for download for over a month, only 3,361 registrations have been completed so far owing to the absence of follow-up measures or legal action by the authorities. There has also not been any noticeable progress in the number of new registrations.

According to officials monitoring the website, shop owners or event managers can easily generate QR codes using their mobile numbers and display them at shops or event venues. Customers or event participants can easily scan the code using their mobile phones and enter their details on the portal without any technical hurdles, they said.

The sole purpose of introducing the e-platform was to replace a comparatively insecure manual method with a safer option. Accurate recording of data too was another objective, as particulars entered in several registers were found illegible during examination.

Despite directives to local self-government bodies, rapid response teams, health squads, and the police to monitor its proper implementation at the time of the launch, they have failed to do it along with other routine tasks. Also, some shop owners openly opposed it, claiming that it posed hurdles to those without smartphones. According to them, reduced staff strength too is a reason for not trying such options.

Meanwhile, IT Mission officials said that accurate entry of visitor details, preferably through the new platform, was crucial for COVID-19 related data analytics and information management for better preparation for the days to come. The Chief Minister too had called for its effective use by traders, they added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/qr-code-based-visitor-registration-service-a-non-starter/article32748048.ece
259,2020/10/02,High Court directs State to grant Maruthu Pandiyar Brothers Descendants pension to three sisters,"The court directed that a government order be passed in recognising the three sisters as the descendants of the Maruthu Pandiyar brothers and the pension be sanctioned to them.

The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to grant the Maruthu Pandiyar Brothers Descendants Pension to three women descendants of the freedom fighters and observed that the discrimination against the women descendents was totally unjustifiable.

The court was hearing the petitions filed by V. Kanaga, C. Maragatham and K. Rajeswari who sought the pension. They challenged the Ramanathapuram Collector’s decision to turn down their request for pension under the scheme in 2017. They sought to quash the order of the Collector and sanction the pension.

Justice R. Suresh Kumar observed that the State government in 1980 came forward to recognise the role played by the Maruthu Pandiyar brothers in the freedom struggle and as a token of respect provided the Freedom Fighters Political Pension to the descendants of the brothers, taking into account that a number of them were struggling financially.

A committee was constituted and 202 people were identified as descendants of the brothers in 1982. Accordingly, the pension at the rate of ₹ 150 per month was sanctioned to all the 202 descendants. However, some of the women descendants were either not considered or included in the list.

The court took into account that two such women Kalyani and Kasthuri Kannan had to approach the court for relief similar to the case of the three women in the present case. These two are none other than the first cousins of the present petitioners, all descendants of the Maruthu Pandiyar brothers, the court observed.

The judge observed that apart from the 202 descendants, if anyone was left out, it is for the government to identify and recognise those descendants because it was not the monetary criteria that had driven the petitioners to the court, but the status and honour that they would enjoy based on such recognition by the government.

When we recollect the freedom struggle, both male and female warriors have made equal contribution to the cause of the motherland, the judge said pointing out to the contribution of freedom fighter Velu Nachiyar to the freedom struggle. The judge observed that the discrimination against women was unjustifiable and set aside the Collector’s order.

The court directed that a government order be passed in recognising the three sisters as the descendants of the Maruthu Pandiyar brothers and the pension be sanctioned to them. The government order shall be passed within a period of eight weeks for the continuous disbursement of the pension to the three petitioners throughout their lifetime, the court said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-directs-state-to-grant-maruthu-pandiyar-brothers-descendents-pension-to-three-sisters/article32754401.ece

Despite the government’s direction against conducting gram sabha meetings on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on Friday, Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and party leaders conducted meetings in several villages of the district.

Tirupparankundram MLA P. Saravanan participated in a grama sabha meeting held at Nilaiyur, during which five resolutions were passed.

The three farm Bills that were passed in the Parliament recently were against the interests of farmers and must be scrapped. Water must be directed from the Vaigai to the Nilaiyur tank to enable farmers to undertake cultivation. Resolutions were also passed regarding clearing waste in water channels, laying new roads and replacing street lights in the constituency.

Madurai East MLA P. Moorthy said that he took part in the gram sabha meetings held at Kodimangalam, Manjampatti and Chinnapatti panchayats. He said that the government had cancelled the gram sabha meetings as they feared that public distress against farm Bills would aggravate.

“They could have allowed the meetings with a limited number of participants and with strict enforcement of COVID-19 safety precautions,” he said.

Madurai South Secretary of DMK M. Manimaran said that he participated in the gram sabha settings held at Kottampatti and Karmathur panchayats.

261,2020/10/02,Tributes paid to Mahatma Gandhi,"The celebrations at the museum were held in a subdued manner due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cleanliness and sanitation were among the main principles propagated by Mahatma Gandhi. Every individual must follow these principles to ensure that our country is truly open defecation-free, said Collector T.G. Vinay during Gandhi Jayanthi celebrations at Gandhi Memorial Museum here on Friday.

Residents must avoid dumping waste into waterbodies and work towards keeping their schools, roads and other public places clean, he added. Treating other human beings with respect is another important principle propagated by Mahatma Gandhi.

“All of us must stand against discrimination of minorities and people from backward communities,” he said.

The Collector also distributed prizes for students who won the essay writing and drawing competitions on Mahatma Gandhi, that were conducted by the Museum.

Treasurer of the museum N.M.R.K. Jawahar Bapu, Curator K.R. Nanda Rao and Madurai Government Museum Curator M. Maruthu Pandiyan were present during the event.

The celebrations at the museum were held in a subdued manner due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students, freedom fighters and members of various organisations garlanded the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the museum.

All the seven Gandhi museums across the country had an online programme in the evening, during which Mahatma Gandhi’s granddaughter Tara Gandhi Bhattacharjee spoke.

In the morning, Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar, Madurai Member of Parliament Su Venkatesan, Collector, Madurai Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan and MLAs garlanded the statue of Mahatma Gandhi at the Khadi showroom on West Masi Street.

The Revenue Minister said that it was here that Mahatma Gandhi shed his traditional attire and chose to wear ‘loincloth'. Mahatma Gandhi’s 14 personal items are present at the Gandhi Memorial Museum here, he added.

262,2020/10/02,HC relief for widow of freedom fighter,"Madurai

The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Thursday directed the Centre to grant the freedom fighter’s pension to the 75-year-old widow of a freedom fighter. The court observed that it was pathetic that she was made to approach the court for the relief.

Justice R. Suresh Kumar directed the Centre to grant the relief to M. Meenachi whose husband Muppidathi was a freedom fighter. Muppidathi who was receiving the freedom fighter’s pension under the Central scheme died in 2013.

Under the scheme, the wife was also eligible for the pension. It was only in 2017 the petitioner applied for the pension as she had no other source of income. Her application should have been considered swiftly by the authorities concerned, the court said.

This kind of long delay could have been avoided, the judge said and directed the Centre to consider her application and pass necessary orders sanctioning the Freedom Fighter’s Dependent Pension under the Swatantrata Sainik Samman Pension Scheme.

The court said that the pension amount shall be granted with arrears from 2013 and the needful shall be undertaken within a period of six weeks.

Speaking at the gram sabha meeting organised by the DMK at Veerasikkampatti village in Athur Union here on Friday, he said that the State government had ignored the farmers’ interest and charged that they were interested only in their political future.

The Centre, which was more worried about the survival of select corporate houses, had pledged the interests of the farmers. The next step by the Centre was to lift the free power, which was now in vogue to the farmers, when the elections get over in Tamil Nadu, he claimed.

“Since the amends will help only the corporate firms, the farmers, who will be forced to enter agreements with these companies promising them to sell their produce at the price fixed by the buyer, should oppose it vehemently until they were withdrawn.

Crime Branch – Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) has arrested two persons, including a Block Technology Manager, P. Socrates Pandi (29) of Usilampatti in connection with the fraud in PM Kisan scheme in Madurai district.

The other person is M. Viswanathan (45), who runs a common service centre in Usilampatti. Both were sent to judicial custody.

Viswanathan was one of the 16 persons against whom the CB-CID had registered a case of cheating on Monday.

While interrogating him, the sleuths found that Socrates Pandi, who works for the Department of Agriculture on consolidated pay basis, had revealed the user identity and password of the official to approve, after scrutiny, the applications received online seeking ₹ 6,000 annual assistance for farmers under the scheme.

However, with the password, Viswanthan had not only uploaded the applications but also “approved” ineligible persons and enrolled them to get the benefits illegally.

Addressing gram sabha meetings organised by the party at Kalkurichi and P. Pudupatti under Kariyapatti panchayat union here on Friday, he said the recently-enacted farm legislations would make farmers a slave under the corporates.

“Vast extent of farm land has already been taken over by corporates to set up solar power plants in the district. Slowly, the extent of cultivation will shrink putting food security in peril,” he added.

Similarly, the one nation, one ration scheme was against the State as Tamil Nadu was offering more goods, including free rice. “If people from other States take our goods, local people will be denied the ration goods,” he charged.

Work on installing two 625 KV diesel generators at Thoothukudi airport, which is being expanded to handle bigger aircraft even at night and additional number of passengers, commenced recently.

The Thoothukudi airport, which is being presently served with a 70 KV generator, is badly in need of additional power back up facilities with higher capacity as the aerodrome’s runway is being expanded to handle wide-bodied aircrafts even after dusk and consequently, more number of passengers. Since the airport has been equipped with night landing facility, need for having additional power generators with higher capacity was underlined during the recently-held meetings of Airports Authority of India.

Consequently, 2 X 625 KV generators are to be installed before March 2021 on an outlay of ₹1.16 crore as it will be handy for keeping the airport terminal and the runway operational even at night and even during acute power shortage. While one of these two generators will be in use, the remaining one will be on standby mode.

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to come forward to issue government orders prescribing the age, educational qualifications and physical fitness for the purpose of engagement and method of engagement of nominal muster roll employees.

Disposing of a batch of petitions, Justice R. Suresh Kumar observed that the government order may indicate or prescribe the educational qualifications of only or the maximum of up to Higher Secondary for engaging candidates. Highly qualified people having professional degrees, graduation and postgraduation degrees shall be avoided, the court said.

Though there was no express provision prohibiting engaging a highly qualified person in an NMR job or as an NMR employee, such kind of engagement cannot be encouraged. This kind of irregular entry into a government job, even at the level of an NMR job, is a plan to grab the government job, the court said.

272,2020/10/02,"Mechanised boat, insulated truck destroyed in fire","Property gutted is said to be worth over ₹1 crore

A mechanised boat with fishnets, worth over ₹1 crore, was completely destroyed as fire broke out in the vessel after a LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) cylinder inside the boat burst even as the crew were preparing lunch at Tharuvaikulam Fishing Harbour around Friday noon.

Fortunately, no one was injured.

Tharuvaikulam Fishing Harbour, base for 128 mechanised boats involved in multi-day deep sea fishing and around 350 country boats, was abuzz with activities on Friday, as boats in batches were resuming fishing operations from Wednesday onwards after berthing the vessels for celebrating the coastal hamlet’s 10-day-long St. Michael’s Church annual feast that ended on last Tuesday (September 29).

Even as the crew of the moored mechanised fiberglass boat, owned by S. Antony Raj, 50, of 60 Veedu Colony in Tharuvaikulam, were preparing lunch in the kitchen beneath the wheelhouse after loading provisions – 500 ice bars and 2,500 litres of fuel – all required for the 2-week-long deep sea stay fishing, fire apparently broke out due to a damaged tube of the LPG cylinder, usually used for cooking in the boats even in high seas.

Though, the crew managed to come out of the boat immediately, fire engulfed the vessel within no time. Aided by a strong sea breeze, fire spread to other parts of the boat. When the LPG cylinder exploded, fire spread to an insulated truck, owned by K. Dominic, 47, of Manickapuram in Thoothukudi, which had brought ice bars to the boats as it had been parked just a few feet away from the boat.

“Though the fire spread to the boats berthed next to this ill-fated vessel, people in the fishing harbour doused it immediately with seawater. A couple of boat drivers, who were in the fishing harbour to board their vessels to resume fishing operations, courageously entered the violently burning boat with ropes so as to tow it into the sea with another boat in a bid to save other vessels from the mishap,” said A. Aniton, a witness to the mishap.

Meanwhile, two fire tenders from Thoothukudi Fire Station, on getting the call around noon, arrived at the spot to start firefighting operations.

“Even as the burning vessel was being towed by a boat to a safer distance, the rope got snapped. Undeterred by this challenge, a few youths dived into the sea with another rope to tie it to the propeller to bring the badly damaged boat closer to shores on the southern side of the fishing harbor as 300-odd country boats were anchored on the northern side. As the boat was towed closer to the shores, the firefighters doused the flame completely after a 3-hour-long battle,” said Manoharan, a fish exporter who was present at the fishing harbour.

The police, fire and rescue services and the fisheries departments are probing the incident.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hk2ep9/article32752763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA03FIRETUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/mechanised-boat-insulated-truck-destroyed-in-fire/article32752764.ece
273,2020/10/02,GRH doctors perform corneal regraft,"Madurai

Doctors of Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) performed a corneal regraft on a 22-year-old man with congenital aniridia (absence of iris by birth), who had previously undergone an unsuccessful corneal transplant at a private hospital. After 10 months of the regraft, the patient can work independently.

Head of the Department of Ophthalmology U. Vijaya Shanmugam, who had led a team of doctors in performing the transplant, said the patient had undergone a corneal transplant in a private hospital 10 months back and then approached the GRH.

“When we diagnosed the patient, it was found that he had congenital aniridia and he only had light perception,” said Dr. Vijaya Shanmugam.

The patient was found suitable to undergo another corneal transplant. So, regrafting was done with the cornea retrieved from a young victim who had died in a road accident. The victim had donated his eyes to the GRH under the Hospital Corneal Retrieval Programme (HCRP).

The corneal transplant was successfully completed. “Today, the patient has crossed the risky period of graft rejection and he can work independently,” he added.

A press release from the GRH Dean J. Sangumani said that this was a challenging case and congratulated the doctors for the surgery.

275,2020/10/02,BSNL employees observe fast,"Urging the Union Government to give permission for giving 4G mobile phone services to its subscribers, the BSNL employees observed fast here on Thursday.

Led by P. Murugaperumal, president of BSNL Trade Unions Confederation, the protestors observed hunger strike on the premises of BSNL General Manager’s Office here.

The protestors said the Union Government, while immediately giving permission to private players for offering 4 G mobile phone services, was refusing to give similar permission to the BSNL, the official communicator.

After creating a lot of hurdles for BSNL to purposely delay its 4 G service that forced many subscribers to leave BSNL and become the customers of private players under the mobile number portability scheme, permission was being given to provide the service only in a few places.

Though private mobile phone service providers were giving 4 G services across the country, the BSNL cannot give similar service to its customers even though it was promoted by the Central Government.

“While poisoning its baby (BSNL), the Union Government is feeding others and the reasons are known to everyone,” the protestors alleged.

276,2020/10/02,Onion prices skyrocket in Dindigul wholesale market,"Despite the ban on exports, onion prices touched a new high at the wholesale market here on Thursday. The district, which is known as the biggest market for onion varieties, attributed the high prices to poor arrivals.

Apart from merchants from Coimbatore, Madurai and Tiruchi who procure onions and shallots from here, the onions are also exported to Singapore, Sri Lanka and Indonesia by some of the merchants here.

Due to COVID-19 and the curfew imposed by the governments, trading activity had come to a standstill since March. When the governments relaxed the guidelines and lifted the curfew, onions could not be procured from Karnataka due to heavy rains there, said Marimuthu, deputy secretary of the Dindigul Mandi and Commission Agents Association.

He said that rains had destroyed many onion farms in Karnataka.

The market here, which usually receives 10 truck loads of shallots and 4,000 kilos of onions (big) on alternate days was now seeing very poor arrivals. “Hardly four trucks have arrived in the last three days. The Bellary variety, which is one of the fast moving commodities, was being quoted at very high price and not many wholesale merchants were not keen on procuring that,” he added.

With the prices now revolving at ₹65 to ₹80 per kg here, it may soon touch the three digit figure, merchants apprehend citing the heavy rains in Karnataka.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/s2zv88/article32752567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA03SHALLOTSDGL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/onion-prices-skyrocket-in-dindigul-wholesale-market/article32752568.ece
277,2020/10/02,"Rescue 106 workers stranded in Kuwait, urges Vaiko","Member of Parliament and MDMK general secretary Vaiko has appealed to the Minister of External Affairs Jaishankar to take immediate steps to ensure the early and safe return of 106 labourers including 102 workers from Tamil Nadu, who are stranded in Kuwait after their employer did not give them salary for four months and also failed to renew their visas.

In a letter to the Minister, Mr. Vaiko said he had received SOS from 106 employees of a Kuwait-based construction company, who were stranded in a dingy room in the Middle East country after the employer refused to give them their salary and renew their work permit and visas. Since they were not paid their salary since June last even as their visas had expired, they could not move out of the place where they had been forcibly confined.

“When we forwarded a letter to the Indian Embassy in Kuwait, the officials there asked us not to come to the Embassy in person in the wake of COVID-19 and hence we sent an e-mail explaining our ordeals. However, no action has been taken by the Indian Embassy officials to rescue us,” says a stranded worker in a video posted on social media.

Hence, Mr. Vaiko, who has also forwarded this video to the External Affairs Minister, has appealed to Mr. Jaishankar to take immediate steps through the Indian Embassy in Kuwait to rescue the stranded workers, mostly from Tamil Nadu, and make efforts to get their salary arrears.

“Moreover, they have not been given their annual incentives as assured by the employer. Since the aged workers and those who are suffering from various ailments such as diabetes, hypertension etc. do not have access to medicines, kindly take immediate action to rescue them safely and at the earliest,” Mr. Vaiko appealed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/rescue-106-workers-stranded-in-kuwait-urges-vaiko/article32752495.ece

280,2020/10/02,"Mangaluru Mayor, Commissioner initiate awareness drive on waste segregation at source","While wet waste will be collected from the houses every day, dry waste will be collected once a week.

Giving impetus to segregation of waste at source, Mayor Divakar and Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) Commissioner Akshy Sridhar on Friday initiated a drive to visit houses and make people aware of segregating waste at source as part of Gandhi Jayanti celebrations.

The MCC has announced imposing fines from October 11 if the waste is not segregated.

People have been told to segregate solid waste at source from Thursday. While wet waste will be collected from the houses every day, dry waste will be collected once a week.

This announcement was made after the High Court of Karnataka took the MCC to task for lagging behind in implementation of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.

Mr. Divakar and Mr. Sridhar started the drive by visiting the house of senior Congress leader and former chairman of Mangaluru Urban Development Authority Suresh Ballal, which is 500 metres from the MCC building.

Apart from giving a pamphlet about waste segregation, they gave him a pamphlet related to COVID-19 and its precautions.

The two then proceeded to the house of M. Sureshchandra Shetty, president of the Karnataka Wrestling Federation, followed by three other houses in Mannagudda.

Councillors Leelavati and Sandhya Acharya accompanied them.

Speaking at the function later, Mr. Sridhar said the city lagged behind in solid waste management. “We were known as a clean city in 2018. We need to move forward and continue to work in keeping the city clean,” he said, and added that waste segregation should not just be a one-day exercise.

Mr. Sridhar said instructions have been given to Antony Solid Waste Handling Cell Private Limited to strictly follow waste segregation.

Mr. Divakar said the MCC was serious about waste segregation this time.

A house-to-house awareness drive will be held in all 60 wards, he said.

The two symbolically launched the exercise by presenting ID cards to six ragpickers.

They also joined Rotary Club members in garlanding the bust of Mahatma Gandhi near the MCC.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/g6zb8s/article32756135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3BG-DRIVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/mayor-commissioner-initiate-awareness-drive-on-waste-segregation-at-source/article32752545.ece
281,2020/10/02,Ramakrishna Mission aims to raise 100 urban forests in Mangaluru,"Miyawaki urban forest dedicated on Ramakrishna Mutt premises

Mangaluru Ramakrishna Mission secretary Swami Jitakamananda on Friday said the mission intends to raise a hundred Miyawaki urban forests in the city in the coming days.

He was speaking after Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra and Mangaluru City Corporation Commissioner (MCC) Akshy Sridhar dedicated a Miyawaki urban forest, the second by the mission in the city, on the Ramakrishna Mutt premises.

The initiative was sponsored by the CSR initiatives of Syngene-Biocon Foundation.

The seer said after the dedication of the first forest in front of the zilla panchayat, the process was halted owing to COVID-19.

The one dedicated on Friday has about 600 saplings, of 59 tree varieties native to the Western Ghat, on about five cents.

Speaking on the occasion, Range Forest Officer P. Sridhar said the Forest Department would support afforestation initiatives. Such forests need not be raised on government land alone. If citizens are keen, the department will provide the required saplings, he said.

Swachh Mangaluru convener Swami Ekagamyananda said volunteers in the city and the district, who participated in the cleanliness drive for five years, were asking, “What next?”

The mission has been promoting pot-composting to reduce wet waste being dumped in dumping yards, he said. A start-up, Mangala Resource Management Pvt., Ltd., was handling the wet waste at doorsteps of about 10 apartments. The demand was there from another 60 apartments, he added

It would also manage dry waste shortly.

Dr. Rajendra said there is no magic solution to improving the environment and it can happen only through afforestation. Keeping the city clean was a major challenge in Mangaluru and the pot-composting initiative was a good move. The administration would support the initiatives of the mission, he said.

Mr. Sridhar said raising urban forests in vacant land in corporation limits could prevent dumping of garbage. The civic body was open to suggestions, he said. No amount of fine could discourage waste generation and dumping, he added.

The Centre on Friday permitted Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh to go for an additional borrowing of ₹7,376 crore, to meet their expenditure requirements amid falling revenues due to the COVID-19 crisis.

“The Ministry of Finance has granted additional borrowing permission to two more States, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, for successfully undertaking reforms in the public distribution system (PDS) and ease of doing business,” an official statement said.

This will make an additional amount of ₹7,376 crore available to these States, it added.

Uttar Pradesh has become sixth State to complete the reform process in PDS to implement the One Nation-One Ration Card system.

This has made the State eligible to raise an amount of ₹4,851 crore through open market borrowings (OMBs).

Andhra Pradesh has become the first State in the country to successfully undertake ease of doing business reforms and has thus become eligible to raise an additional amount of ₹2,525 crore through open market borrowings.

Earlier, Andhra Pradesh had also completed PDS reforms to enable the One Nation-One Ration Card system.

Last week, five States — Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Goa, Karnataka and Tripura — received the finance ministry’s nod for additional ₹9,913 crore borrowing, after meeting the reform condition of the implementation of One Nation-One Ration Card system.

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the central government in May 2020 allowed an additional borrowing limit of up to 2% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) to the states for the year 2020-21. This made an amount up to ₹4,27,302 crore available to the States.

One per cent of this is subject to the implementation of four specific state-level reforms, where weightage of each reform is 0.25% of GSDP. These reforms include implementation of the One Nation-One Ration Card system, ease of doing business reform, urban local body or utility reforms, and power sector reforms.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/s4a49j/article31981657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PDS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/finmin-allows-additional-7106-crore-borrowing-by-up-ap/article32751637.ece

285,2020/10/02,"Tesla to enter India next year, says Elon Musk","CEO Musk tweets assurance; had earlier cited ‘high’ duties

Elon Musk, the co-founder and CEO of automaker Tesla Inc, on Friday tweeted that the company would be entering the Indian market “next year for sure”.

Mr. Musk was replying to a tweet with pictures of a t-shirt with messages ‘India wants Tesla’ and ‘India loves Tesla’.

In response to another tweet in which a Twitter account stated that they were waiting for this piece of news for ages, Mr. Musk added, “Thanks for waiting!”

However, this isn’t the first time that the Tesla chief has hinted at an entry into the Indian market.

Last year, he had tweeted saying that import duties in India were “extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable,” amid expectation of a 2020 launch.

Likewise, in 2017, Mr. Musk had said he was hopeful of an India entry in the summer of that year. However, he had later tweeted, “Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that.”

Had sought relief

He had further said that the company was in discussions with the Indian government, requesting temporary relief on import penalties/restrictions until a local factory was built.

The Commerce and Industry Ministry, however, had then clarified that it wasn’t accurate to say that the Foreign Direct Investment policy mandates any company to conform to any minimum sourcing of local components if it wanted to establish a manufacturing unit in India.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/vhmnqv/article32754923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03BUELONMUSK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/tesla-to-enter-india-next-year/article32754924.ece
286,2020/10/02,Paytm CEO rallies app operators against Google over Play Store’s billing mandate,"Paytm founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma doubled down in his bid to rally Indian app operators against Google over the U.S. company’s requirement that apps use the Play Store’s billing system for in-app purchases of digital goods, by firing a salvo on Twitter.

“Be the app that, you want to see in the world. Condition: If only Google let’s you be,” Mr. Sharma tweeted on Friday.

Last month, Google had briefly removed Paytm from its Play Store citing a violation of its policy on gambling. Paytm had at the time called upon the Indian start-up ecosystem and developers to “think the bigger question”. “As a start-up, we are running law-abiding businesses and building for India. Google and its employees are making policies which are over and above the laws of our country, and are arbitrarily implementing them,” it had said.

Several Indian start-ups have been exercised over Google’s notification on applications needing to mandatorily use Google Play’s billing system as the method of payment for access to features or services, including any digital content or goods.

Earlier this week, senior representatives from almost a dozen start-ups joined a call to discuss ways to deal with Google’s alleged ‘dominance’, including setting up an alternative to Google Play Store and seeking government intervention.

Industry body IAMAI, which counts Google as a member, had also in a recent statement suggested a meeting of founders, a community that it said was ‘on fire’ at Google’s announcement.

“Just because Google owns the gate and the gateway to the digital ecosystem of this country, they should not act arbitrarily and enforce their rules and regulations which are contrary to our country’s laws,” Vishwas Patel, founder, CCAvenues and chairman, Payments Council Of India, had said.

“Also, they cannot force Indian apps developers / owners selling digital services to compulsorily use the Google billing and payment system and charge 30% MDR,” he added.

“Prima facie, Google’s announcement even if legal is certainly not innocuous,” IAMAI had said in its statement. “For many founders of Indian start-ups this brings back fears of the not so old deeply problematic revenue share model between VAS service providers and telcos. Telcos took up to 70% revenue share from VAS companies on the pretext of discovery, marketing, collection. In India, 98% of people use mobile Internet, more than 90% of people use Android phones which gives Google control over many layers between customers and their service providers,” the industry body had said.

Google clarified on its blog that all apps distributed on Google Play offering in-app purchases of digital goods had always needed to use Google Play’s billing system. It added that less than 3% of developers with apps on Play sold digital goods over the last 12 months, and of this 3%, the vast majority (nearly 97%) already used Google Play’s billing. For those few developers who needed to update their apps, they would have until September 30, 2021, to make those changes. New apps submitted after January 20, 2021, would need to be in compliance, it said.

“We only collect a service fee if the developer charges users to download their app or they sell in-app digital items, and we think that is fair. Not only does this approach allow us to continuously reinvest in the platform, this business model aligns our success directly with the success of developers,” the U.S. firm added.

“As an open ecosystem, most Android devices come pre-installed with more than one store — and users can install others. Android provides developers the freedom and flexibility to distribute apps through other Android app stores, directly via websites, or device preloads, all without using Google Play’s billing system,” the Internet company said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/1kjag3/article32755075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03BUPAYTM,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/paytm-ceo-rallies-app-operators-against-google-over-play-stores-billing-mandate/article32754897.ece

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has said that once a resolution plan for a debt-ridden company is approved by the lenders, the successful bidder cannot be permitted to withdraw its offer.

A three-member NCLAT bench said the sanctity of the resolution process has to be maintained and such withdrawal by a successful bidder ‘frustrates’ the entire exercise of Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process.

Moreover, there is also no express provision in the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code to allow any successful resolution applicant to ‘stage a U-turn’, it added.

“We are of the considered opinion that the sanctity of resolution process has to be maintained and the resolution applicant whose resolution plan has been approved by Committee of Creditors cannot be permitted to withdraw its Resolution Plan,” the bench headed by Acting Chairman Justice B.L. Bhat said. The NCLAT further said even under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, there is no express provision for allowing any successful resolution applicant to “stage a U-turn” and withdraw its bids, after being selected by the CoC.

“Provision for submission of a Performance Bank Guarantee by a resolution applicant while submitting its resolution plan, as required under the amended provisions of IBBI [Insolvency Resolution Process of Corporate Persons] Regulations, 2016 is a step in this direction, but may not be deterrent enough to prevent a Successful Resolution Applicant from taking a U-turn,” the NCLAT said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/o9hc22/article32754571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th03BUNCLAT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/successful-bidder-cannot-withdraw-offer-rules-nclat/article32754574.ece

Trade unions on Friday gave a call for a nationwide strike on November 26 to protest against the government policies.

The decision to go on strike was taken during an online or virtual National Convention of Workers on October 2, 2020, as per a declaration adopted by ten central unions and their associates.

“The Convention calls upon all the working people, whether unionised or not, affiliated or independent, whether from organised sector or unorganised sector, to intensify the united struggle against the anti-people, anti-worker, anti-farmer and anti-national policies of the government and make the call for a countrywide general strike on 26th November 2020 a total success,” it said.

The National Convention Of Workers organised online jointly by the Central Trade Unions and independent Federations/Associations for the first time amid the pandemic.

While all indicators pointed to economy drastically slowing down due to lack of demand, the government continued to steer its policies in the name of “ease of doing business”, aggravating widespread impoverishment and deepening the crisis further, the unions alleged.

The convention called upon the working class to organise joint state/ district/ industry/sectoral level conventions, physically wherever possible, online otherwise, before the end of October 2020; to conduct an extensive campaign on the adverse impact of the labour codes on the workers down to the grassroots level up to mid-November and for the one-day countrywide general strike on November 26, 2020.

Mobile phone prices are expected to rise about 3% as the government has imposed 10% duty on the import of displays, industry body ICEA said on Friday.

The duty on display assembly and touch panel was proposed to be applied from October 1 under a phased manufacturing programme (PMP) announced in 2016 in consensus with the industry.

“There will be an impact on mobile phone prices between 1.5 and 3%,” industry body ICEA National Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said in a statement.

India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) members include Apple, Huawei, Xiaomi, Vivo and Winstron.

The objective of the PMP was to facilitate manufacturing of components indigenously and discourage imports thereafter.

“In a rare miss, the industry could not ramp up display assembly production adequately because of COVID-19 and NGT embargo. We continue to be fully committed to domestic manufacturing of sub-assemblies and components. However, now, the focus is to take a lion’s share of global markets and not just import substitution,” Mr. Mohindroo said.

Vedanta Group Chairman Anil Agarwal-promoted Volcan Investments had proposed to set up the country’s first LCD manufacturing unit in 2016 with investment of around ₹68,000 crore in the name of Twinstar Display Technologies. However, the proposal did not get the government’s approval and the project could not take off.

Similarly, ITC Ltd has filed an application seeking initiation of anti-dumping investigation concerning imports of Decor Paper from the neighbouring country.

Both the companies have alleged that dumping of these products has impacted respective industries.

On the basis of the duly substantiated written application by or on behalf of the domestic industry, and having satisfied itself, on the basis of the prima facie evidence submitted by the domestic industry, the DGTR has initiated the investigations, according to two separate notifications of the directorate.

If it is established that dumping has caused material injury to the domestic players, the DGTR would recommend imposition of anti-dumping duty on the imports from China.

The finance ministry takes the final decision to impose the duties.

The directorate is also probing alleged dumping of ‘Caprolactam’, used in nylon making, from European Union, Korea, Russia and Thailand.

Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd has filed the application for the same.

“The applicant has alleged that material injury is being caused to the domestic industry due to dumped imports from the subject countries and has requested for the imposition of the anti-dumping duties on the imports,” according to a separate notification of the DGTR.

An investigation is also started against alleged dumping of ‘Elastomeric Filament Yarn’ exported from Singapore following a complaint by Indorama lndustries Ltd.

Countries start anti-dumping probes to determine whether their domestic industries have been hurt because of a surge in cheap imports. As a countermeasure, they impose these duties under the multilateral regime of the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation (WTO).

The duty is aimed at ensuring fair trading practices and creating a level-playing field for domestic producers vis-a-vis foreign producers and exporters.

India has already imposed an anti-dumping duty on several products to tackle cheap imports from various countries, including China.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/wyiz9l/article32752105.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ITC,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/india-initiates-anti-dumping-probe-against-two-chinese-products/article32752106.ece

India’s domestic steel consumption during April-August dropped to its lowest in at least six years, government data analysed by Reuters showed, underlining the economic slowdown and slump in infrastructure spending.

Steel consumption, in the first five months of the fiscal year, was at 27.4 million tonnes, a 35% fall over last year, data showed. The reading was also the lowest since data was collated in the current form beginning FY15.

Finished steel production also fell over 30% during April-August to 30 million tonnes, data showed.

Steel producers, however, continued to ride out the domestic slump by focussing on exports, with China emerging as the top buyer, shipping in a record 1.7 million tonnes during April-August.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ahwdg2/article32747353.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THBUSTEEL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/april-august-local-steel-usage-lowest-in-6-years/article32747354.ece

India’s electricity generation rose for the first time in seven months in September, government data showed, as the removal of most COVID-19-related restrictions boosted power demand in three-quarters of the States.

Activity in India’s factories expanded at its fastest pace in over eight years in September as a relaxation in lockdowns drove a surge in demand and output, a survey showed on Thursday.

A Reuters analysis of daily load despatch data from federal grid operator POSOCO showed that power generation rose 4.9% in September, the first monthly increase since February.

The firm said that while 51% respondents ‘yes, came across many such ads’, 24% said ‘yes, came across a few such ads’. Only 2% said they did not come across any such ads that they felt were designed to mislead children into spending, while 23% were unsure about it.

A recent draft policy on misleading advertisements ‘Central Consumer Protection Authority (prevention of misleading advertisements and necessary due diligence for endorsement of advertisements) Guideline, 2020’ has said an advertisement should not take advantage of children’s inexperience, credulity or sense of loyalty, or exaggerate the features of goods or service in a way that could lead to children having unrealistic expectations of the goods or service, and include a direct promotion to children to purchase the a goods or service or to persuade their parents to purchase the same for them.

“Consumers were also asked if, in the last one year, they had come across ads for free products where they have to pay for packaging, handling or administration of the free product. 20% said they had come across many such ads while 29% said they had come across a few such ads. 46% said they had not come across any such ads,” the company said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ads-misleading-children-prevalent/article32747429.ece
296,2020/10/02,A strategic dealing with China,"India must engage with China economically even as it confronts it militarily

On July 2, an article in The Economist was headlined Hit Them Where It Hurts Us: India has few good ways to punish China for its Himalayan land-grab. It argued that “most economic sanctions would harm India, too”. Instead of taking knee-jerk, retaliatory decisions against China following border flare-ups, India should consider joining the rest of the world in reining in China and calling it out for its worst excesses.

Consider this: Chinese venture capitalists have poured in more than $8 billion into some of India’s most successful startups. China supplies many goods and services that India needs, and will continue to need. While India relies heavily on imports from China, a smaller portion of China’s imports are from India.

Data | Is an economic boycott of China feasible for India?

Further, the timing of the economic decoupling with China that India is attempting could not have come at a worse time. The Indian economy, which was faring badly even before COVID-19 struck, is badly affected by it. The pandemic is showing no signs of abating. The situation is not going to get any better over the next few quarters unless India takes pragmatic steps to overcome these challenges. On the economic front, India must re-engage with China economically even as it confronts it militarily.

Lessons from China

In fact, China itself provides lessons on this strategy. China claims Taiwan as its own territory and sometimes threatens invasion. In August, a top official from Taiwan said that Taiwan faces an increasingly difficult position as China pressures it to accept conditions that would turn it into the next Hong Kong. But China remains the top destination for Taiwan’s exports and outbound investment. Trade between the China and Taiwan has remained strong over the past four years. The Taiwanese firm Foxconn, for instance, makes almost all the iPhones that the world buys from factories in China.

Similarly, tensions simmer between China and the its largest trading partner, the U.S., but that doesn’t stop China from continuing to do business with the U.S. Tesla’s massive car and battery plants are coming up in China and American farmers still sell soya to China, though U.S. soybean exports to China have fallen.

Comment | How to counter China

The European Union, China’s second largest trading partner, continues to be robustly engaged with China. A recent report by the Norwegian logistics firm Tschudi bared the surprising extent of overland trade facilitated by rail links established with Europe by China as part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). On this, a report of the China Railway Corporation, cited by Tschudi, makes a telling point that “in the first half of 2017 more than 3,000 container trains” ran “between the two continents since the start of 2017 exceeding the total for the previous six years combined and serving 35 cities in China, with 34 destinations in Europe”.

Unlike India, which has been talking for years about establishing road and rail connectivity with its immediate neighbours and even Southeast Asia but doing little about it, China’s ambitious BRI is a vision that is being realised in quick time. This has now reached India’s doorstep and is bad news for India.

Comment | Can India decouple itself from Chinese manufacturing?

No knee-jerk reactions

The Brookings Policy Brief of May 2020 titled India’s limited trade connectivity with South Asia 2020 details how “after 2005, China has consistently increased its trade with South Asia”. It says, “Defying the logic of proximity, most of India’s neighbours are now largely reliant on China for their imports.” India in fact is in danger of becoming a bit player in its own backyard.

China under President Xi Jinping is strategic. Mark Leonard, the Director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, elaborated on the depth of debate and discussion that goes into Chinese policymaking in his 2008 book What Does China Think. The Chinese American economist, Yukon Huang, makes the same point in far greater detail in Cracking the China Conundrum. India should listen to these voices and not react in a knee-jerk manner with China.

297,2020/10/02,Being witness to the Babri Masjid demolition,"No court judgment can erase what journalists recorded in Ayodhya in 1992

In the FIR carefully written out in Hindi at Thana Ramjanambhoomi, Ayodhya on December 11, 1992, I mentioned two U-matic tapes, one camera battery, one Hanimex still camera and a still film roll. I was reporting back then on television for a monthly video news magazine, Eyewitness. But writing FIRs was certainly a first for someone two and a half years into the trade. A photocopy remains with me of the ruled sheet — now Exhibit ‘K’-139 in the ‘AP’ (Ayodhya Prakaran) Lucknow Court.

Reporters like me, rushing to capture the beautiful town of Ayodhya on the banks of the river Sarayu, ended up scrambling between recording the social and political tensions that brewed away from the grandeur of the Sarayu and the story that silent Ayodhya told of living with juxtaposed centuries-old truths.

Editorial | Justice in ruins: On Babri Masjid demolition case verdict

How I landed the assignment was a question I was asked later. I attribute that to my Executive Producer Karan Thapar’s faith in my fluency in Hindi and familiarity with U.P. then. In addition, I was born to a Hindu-Muslim couple, which meant I was familiar with the customs, traditions and prejudices of both sides. What was clear in our monthly news meetings was that something important was bound to occur on December 6, given that thousands had been allowed to gather there by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led State government headed by Chief Minister Kalyan Singh. There was a court order permitting “symbolic construction” outside the Babri Masjid. The State government gave a sworn assurance to the apex court that no harm would be allowed to fall on the 16th century mosque, the epicentre of massive turmoil whipped up by a countrywide rath yatra two years earlier and campaigns for years preceding it, making it a symbol of hate.

The age of the journalist foregrounding herself was still a few decades away. But as the focussed demolition was captured by cameras and pens, reporters and camerapersons did end up as part of the story. After ensuring that their devices stopped recording the demolition that started taking place shortly before noon, reporters were evicted from the site of the “symbolic kar seva”.

But notebooks, ballpoints and cameras were still to be able to capture what unfolded. Recorders of the event — photographers like Praveen Jain and reporters like Mark Tully, Ramdutt Tripathi and Rakesh Sinha — managed to gather their notes, pictures and wits to tell the tale.

This reporting assignment lasted a long time. Reporters were turned into witnesses in courts and an inquiry commission always managed to bring the assignment back to life. All ‘ground’ stints are excellent teachers; this one more so. Tracking the story of the nation from then on made the reporter’s notebook a really thick and much thumbed one. The one disturbing question after this week’s Central Bureau of Investigation court order is whether vandals attacking journalists to ensure that no evidence survived of the demolition have won this round.

But the first draft of history was recorded faithfully then and it will hold good against all attempts to rewrite the events of that fateful day. No court judgment can erase or overturn what a bunch of journalists saw, recorded and wrote from Ayodhya on December 6, 1992.

298,2020/10/02,Should online gambling in India be regulated?,"Regulation, rather than a ban, could bring with it several benefits as seen in other countries

A few weeks ago, Google pulled Paytm from the Play Store for violating its gambling policies. The growing popularity of gaming platforms like Dream11 and Paytm First Games raise questions about whether they are proxies for online gambling as they can involve financial transactions but are currently classified as ‘games of skill’. In a conversation moderated by Jayant Sriram, Jay Sayta (has extensively tracked issues pertaining to the gaming industry and gaming laws over the last decade and now advises several gaming companies on policy, regulatory, tax and legal issues) and Vidushpat Singhania (Managing Partner of Krida Legal and specialises in sports and gaming laws) discuss the current legal position in India on games of skill versus games of chance, the size of the gambling industry, and issues of regulation. Edited excerpts:

We’ll start the discussion with Paytm First Games and Dream11, both of which, I think, most people are familiar with now. The current legal position is that though they are transaction-based, various courts have held that they are games of skill rather than games of chance. Is this settled law now or is there still some grey area?

Jay Sayta: As you said, games of skill are exempt from the ambit of gambling. Gambling and betting are a State subject. Every State has its own legislation on gambling, and most States have an exemption for games of skill. However, these statutes are pretty old, and they do not clearly define or enumerate which games fall within this skill category. Nagaland, for instance, has a separate legislation which details what are games of skill. But for the most part, most States do not have that kind of clarity. So, it falls within the judiciary’s ambit to interpret whether a particular game falls within the ambit of skill or not.

Now, with regards to Dream11 and daily fantasy sports, the matter has gone to multiple High Courts starting from 2017. In 2017, the Punjab and Haryana High Court ruled that the format of Dream11, which involves picking 11 players from a real-life match from both sides and allocating points based on their real-life performance, is a game of skill and does not fall within the definition of gambling. Following that, in 2019, the Bombay High Court also passed a similar ruling. The Rajasthan High Court gave a similar ruling earlier this year. However, on March 6 this year, the Supreme Court, while hearing the appeals from the Maharashtra government against the Bombay High Court’s order on Dream11, issued notice to all parties and stayed the operation of the Bombay order, which means that they will go into the merits of the matter in detail and adjudicate finally on whether it is a game of skill or not.

Vidushpat Singhania: The State Acts largely don’t define what is a game of skill. What you go by is the interpretation given by the Supreme Court in various judgments starting from Satyanarayana (pertaining to the card game Rummy), where it said skill predominates over chance. It’s still open to interpretation for a range of other games. The Rajasthan High Court, Punjab and Haryana High Court, and then the Bombay High Court all held that in the format being offered currently, Dream11 is a game of skill. There have been several appeals filed and dismissed against these judgments. But earlier this year, in another petition that is pending, the Supreme Court looked at it and stayed the order of the Bombay High Court and is looking to hear the matter afresh. What this means is, if the Supreme Court says that daily fantasy sports are games of chance, then the entire industry shuts down and the issue goes back to the States in a sense. State governments can issue licences for these games. If the Supreme Court says it is a game of skill, then the industry is open all over India.

The user base has grown phenomenally for online gaming, especially in this lockdown period. Are most of these transaction-based in some way? What is the size of the industry we are talking about in monetary terms?

Vidushpat Singhania: It’s a very tricky question because the gaming industry has legal as well as illegal components. And not everything is about paid gaming; there is also a lot of free gaming, casual gaming, gaming just for entertainment. Some parts of it are regulated. Betting on horse racing is regulated, casinos in Sikkim and Goa are regulated, certain games of skill are also regulated in States like Nagaland. According to companies like KPMG, the gaming industry in India would be worth about $150 billion.

Jay Sayta: Within that, the category of skill-based games is a complicated one because while these games can involve monetary transactions, they are largely offered for free. These skill-based games themselves could cross a billion dollars in value, the KPMG report states, and are growing at around 30% annually. Now that’s the skill part, but if you’re looking generically at gaming, both skill or chance, it is a very high number. Largely it is unregulated and in the grey space.

Also read | Lockdown brings spotlight on online gaming addiction

Let’s get to the issue of regulation and what that might look like within each of these categories. Let’s start first with illegal gambling.

Jay Sayta: Just taking a step back from how to go about regulation or legalisation, the question we need to ask is whether this is desirable or not; whether a ban or more stringent laws are the answer; or whether we need to take a more nuanced perspective and recognise that even if we pass new laws, this would still continue in some manner or shape.

In my view, regulation, rather than a ban, has certain benefits. One is the revenue argument. Since it’s happening largely underground, it’s a huge source of black money. So, if it is legalised and taxed in a realistic and reasonable manner, it can be a huge source of revenue for the government. The second is with regard to sports betting where there are a lot of allegations of match-fixing. Now, regulated and licensed betting regimes, as in the U.K. and many European countries, have a strong mechanism to monitor each of the betting websites, track suspicious patterns if there is a sudden spike in betting for certain events, and investigate them. And there are, of course, other ancillary benefits like employment.

Vidushpat Singhania: By way of a legal framework, we have regulations in Goa and Sikkim, where there is a licensing regime to allow certain types of casino games. So, you could expand that kind of legislation itself. Or you could look at international examples like the U.K. which has the Gambling Act of 2005. The Act has four or five categories, and they regulate it based on those categories. So, they have casual gaming, mid-level gaming, serious gaming, high-stake gaming. They’ve divided the games into four or five categories, and then based on that, they have a licensing regime. This applies across all games, whether skill or chance. That is the closest we could also go, where we divide various games into various categories and have a different licensing fee for each. Now, whether that can be pan-India or State by State is the issue.

Games of skill seem to exist in a legal grey area. How is this nascent industry being regulated?

Vidushpat Singhania: Games of skill are largely self-regulated. There are bodies such as the All India Gaming Federation, FIFS [Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports] and The Rummy Federation which have developed self-regulation codes for advertisements, the way of playing, taxation... The only State where gaming or skill gaming has been regulated is Nagaland. Otherwise, games of skill are generally self-regulated by these industry bodies, which is not bad. I don’t think we need the government to step in to regulate everything. Maybe a basic level of licensing regime can come in, but the operational regulation, I think, should always be with the industry.

Jay Sayta: I have a bit of a different opinion because self-regulation, be it in gaming or in broadcasting or anywhere else, has always been less than satisfactory. There are no sanctions or penal measures that can be invoked against any erring operators. While it is great that these guidelines or charters are there, there are various operators out there who don’t follow them and there is nothing that can be done against them apart from naming and shaming them. A lot of people must have also seen advertisements about skill gaming companies. Some of them are misleading and give false assurances.

The Consumer Protection Ministry has issued certain guidelines on advertising. Perhaps these real money games can be included in that ambit and certain dos and don’ts [can be specified]. For example, I don’t think it is appropriate to give the message that during the lockdown, you can play day and night on these platforms and use them as instruments to solve your social or financial problems. So, the government should step in.

Also read | Gaming: a question of skill

One issue that immediately stands out is whether there should be a cap on the amount of money people can play with. Is there regulation on this aspect?

Vidushpat Singhania: This is an issue that the Law Commission of India has also gone into. It has said we will have to demarcate serious gaming and casual gaming limits. If somebody is putting up ₹100 or ₹200 a day, you can allow it as a kind of social gaming, because the prizes will also be limited in that sense and you don’t really need a licence. But where the monies are bigger, say you are allowed to put ₹5,000 and you can win up to a crore, that goes into the serious gaming or gambling aspect and that will definitely need complete regulation.

Column | Captains suggest a (legal) bet on things changing

What is the revenue possibility for the government? And how does that tie into the question of regulation?

Vidushpat Singhania: GST [Goods and Services Tax] and income tax are still applicable to these games. It’s only a licensing fee which may not be applicable at this point of time. Dream11, for instance, is paying GST, and the winners will end up paying income tax as well. So, if it is regulated as a game of skill, and the court allows it, then there will be an exponential growth in this game and the collection of GST will increase.

Jay Sayta: The activity is already being taxed. The only aspect is the category of tax. Right now, the argument is that it has legal basis as a game of skill and so it does not fall within the sin category of, say, gambling and casinos. So they are paying a lower amount of tax. That is one aspect which needs to be thought through — whether there needs to be a slightly higher rate of tax for these kinds of activities.

The revenue potential has also been weighed in. If taxed in a rational and reasonable manner, games of skill or chance could lead to tens of thousands of crores in revenue. For instance, the Maharashtra government is already looking at the aspect of regulating sports betting, as per reports.

299,2020/10/02,Brawling in Cleveland: On Trump-Biden debate,"Trump and Biden missed a chance to showcase policies in their first debate

When it was time for U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger for the 2020 election, former Vice-President Joe Biden, to go toe-to-toe in their first ever presidential debate, there was no expectation that the much-anticipated event would showcase bipartisan bonhomie or statesman-like conduct. Yet, the low bar of uncivility on display, undergirded by hostility and a lack of mutual respect, made the event at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, a disturbing spectacle. Almost throughout the 90-minute extravaganza of cognitive disconnect, the two candidates interrupted each other, name-called, and generally made obvious their disdain for the other. A low point for Mr. Trump was when he wilfully sidestepped a passionate defence by Mr. Biden of his late son, Beau, to segue into a vector of proven lies about Mr. Biden’s other son, Hunter, and his business dealings in Russia and the Ukraine. Similarly, Mr. Biden hardly covered himself in glory when he said to Mr. Trump, “Will you shut up, man?”, or referred to him as a clown, a liar and a racist. While many might empathise with Mr. Biden’s sentiments in this context, given Mr. Trump’s record on issues of race, his personal finances and taxes, and his penchant for indulging in acerbic bombast, some Democrats might have hoped that Mr. Biden would hold himself to a higher standard.

One thing that the verbal brawl made clear is that the two leaders will likely offer radically different policy visions, in a sense making the choice between them a straightforward one on November 3, Election Day. Mr. Trump dug his heels in on choosing a right-leaning candidate for the vacant seat in the U.S. Supreme Court after the passing of liberal stalwart Ruth Bader Ginsburg. He refused to label a known white supremacist gang as racists. He stood his ground on his intention to dismember the Affordable Care Act passed by former President Barack Obama — when Mr. Biden was his deputy — by killing off the individual mandate. On every policy of serious consequence to the American middle class, whether in the realms of health care and the COVID-19 response, immigration, job creation, clean energy or women’s reproductive rights, Mr. Trump defended the very same approach he has followed for the past three and a half years. Yet his bungling, ambiguous pandemic response speaks for itself, as does his disastrous record on saving jobs in its wake, and his uncompromisingly harsh tack on immigration. Mr. Biden’s policy agenda might be an echo of the Obama years, reflecting traditional, mainstream Democratic Party values that some Americans have grown to resent. Yet, if he can convince the American people, not of any grand liberal vision but simply that he will better Mr. Trump’s low performance bar, this election might be Mr. Biden’s to lose.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/brawling-in-cleveland-on-trump-biden-first-presidential-debate/article32754846.ece
300,2020/10/02,Undying embers: On Hathras rape,"Increasing gender sensitivity is crucial to enhancing women’s safety

The bleak image of a burning pyre illuminating a ghastly night while policemen stood guard will be forever etched in India’s collective memory. A 19-year-old Dalit girl, who had been allegedly raped and assaulted at Hathras village in Uttar Pradesh on September 14, succumbed to her injuries on September 29. She was cremated in the dead of night with the family claiming they had been kept away from her last rites. This was another unconscionable atrocity committed in Uttar Pradesh. The girl was brutally assaulted when she was doing her chores, collecting fodder in the fields along with her mother. Her spinal cord was fractured and tongue slashed. This inhuman act which follows a string of sexual violence cases in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere in India highlights some grim truths, primarily that the safety of women is not a guarantee despite the stringent laws in place. After the Nirbhaya rape in Delhi in 2012, the government set up a committee led by Justice J.S. Verma. On its recommendations, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act was amended in 2013, bringing in changes to the Indian Penal Code and other laws. This March, the four convicted of the gang rape of Nirbhaya were hanged to death.

The Uttar Pradesh government has set up a Special Investigation Team to look into the allegations levelled by the family; the Chief Minister has promised a compensation of ₹25 lakh and “safety”. That the Chief Minister had to pledge protection is a tacit admission that the administration has failed its most vulnerable citizens. Caste tension continues to simmer on the ground with its inevitable cycle of humiliation, violence and inequities. The girl had been forced to drop out of school years ago. The use of sexual violence to oppress lower castes has been on the rise. On the question of protecting women, Uttar Pradesh has slipped terribly. The latest National Crime Records Bureau data show that Uttar Pradesh registered the highest number of crimes against women in 2019, accounting for 14.7% of India’s total.

301,2020/10/02,Drugs probe: FSL sends back hair samples,"CCB says it was a small technical snag that has been resolved

The Central Crime Branch’s investigation into the drug racket with alleged links to the Kannada film industry hit a snag after the Forensic Science Laboratory in Hyderabad returned hair samples of actors Sanjjanaa Galrani and Ragini Dwivedi.

According to senior police officials, the CCB had not followed due procedure while submitting the evidence for testing. “It is a small technical problem, which has been resolved. We have rectified the problem and sent the samples back,” said Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime).

He added that other samples, namely blood and urine, are already with the FSL.

“This is the first time that the hair sample test is being done to get additional evidence. We have already gathered evidence in the form of technical data, eyewitness accounts, mobile phone analysis and seizures. The tests from the hair samples will be additional evidence. Our case does not stand only on the hair samples. The investigation is on the right track,” said Mr. Patil.

The actors have been accused of using and dealing in drugs like ecstasy and LSD in parties organised for this purpose.

CCB officials have obtained permission to conduct a polygraph test and other ‘scientific tests’ on another key accused in the case, party organiser and socialite Viren Khanna.

“He is refusing to cooperate with the investigation. Hence, scientific investigation may get the CCB some good leads,” said a senior police officer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bhiuev/article32754614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGRAGINIDWIVEDIANDSANJANAGALRANIP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/drugs-probe-fsl-sends-back-hair-samples/article32754615.ece
302,2020/10/02,Revisit thought on making villages self-sufficient: Karnataka HC Chief Justice,"‘Migrants would not have suffered if we had implemented Gandhiji’s village industries model in independent India’

Migrants would not have suffered as they did recently if we had implemented in independent India the thought process of Mahatma Gandhiji that all villages must become self-sufficient and a large number of village industries should be established, said Abhay Shreeniwas Oka, Chief Justice of the High Court of Karnataka.

“This is an area where I personally feel that those who are working in the field of economics must revisit the thought process of Mahatmaji,” he said on Friday while delivering a talk on ‘Relevance of Gandhi in 2020’ through a webinar organised by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority and the Water Institute, Bangaluru University.

The Chief Justice said, “Though I am not an expert in the field of economy, in the present day context when we saw serious issue of migrant labourers [during COVID-19 lockdown], I personally feel that time has come for us to revisit the thought process adopted by Mahatmaji when he said we must give utmost importance to set up village industries.”

“After reading what Mahatmaji has written, I realised that tolerance is one of the qualities which all, the judicial officers and the judges must possess. May be due to pressure of work though we understand importance of tolerance we may not be able to practice it,” he said while pointing out that judicial officers work under enormous pressure.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/cayi10/article32754339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGGHANDLOOMP3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/revisit-thought-on-making-villages-self-sufficient-karnataka-hc-chief-justice/article32754340.ece

304,2020/10/02,"Low-key, but enthusiastic celebrations mark Gandhi Jayanti","Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa garlanded the 27-feet-tall bronze statue of Mahatma Gandhi on the premises of Vidhana Soudha

Political parties, organisations and apartment associations marked the 151st birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on Friday. In the backdrop of the pandemic, most of the events were low-key or held online.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa garlanded the 27-feet-tall bronze statue of Mahatma Gandhi on the premises of Vidhana Soudha. “Gandhi’s life and messages are an inspiration for various programmes and policies of this government,” he said. The Chief Minister also paid his respects to former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri who was born on October 2, 1904.

A programme was organised at Congress Bhavan to pay tributes to both Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.

Documentary on H.S. Doreswamy released

A documentary on centenarian freedom fighter and Gandhian H.S. Doreswamy, Mahan Thatha, was released and screened at the Bharat Scouts and Guides office. A book titled Godsevadigalige Gandhivadada Uttara was also released.

At an event at Mahatma Gandhi Park on M.G. Road where his teachings were presented through augmented reality, Mr. Doreswamy’s message was read out: “Gandhiji saw technology and machines as complementary to human effort. His dream of an independent India was to make all Indians contribute towards nation-building, keeping aside personal ambitions and greed.”

Cycle rally

Bengaluru Smart City Limited and the BBMP came together to organise ‘Ride for Peace’ cycle rally against road violence. Participants cycled from the east gate of Vidhana Soudha through Cubbon Park and M.G. Road to the BBMP office for a better and safer Bengaluru.

305,2020/10/02,Controversial Yelahanka power plant to be commissioned in due course,"Residents and environmentalists are up in arms

For long a controversial project, the Yelahanka power plant’s highly delayed commissioning was jinxed in its first attempt with the fire accident. Though the Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. (KPCL) is treating this as a one-off incident, residents and environmentalists who have been fighting against the plant are even more riled up.

Simmi Kumar, resident of Heritage apartments, which is close to the power plant, said their worst fears had been confirmed. “There was a blast around 3 a.m. Residents saw fire tenders. We didn't know what happened. In the morning we got a message saying there was a blast. This has always been a major fear,” she said.

She pointed out that they live across the road from the plant. “Gas leakage and a blast can be fatal as they can cover a good distance. This is not a small scare. There is a bird conservation reserve. The loud noise is going to impact their habitat. We have some rare birds in the reserve,” she said.

In 2013, the closure of the power plant was announced as it was a diesel generating unit at the time. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) had issued a show-cause notice to the then 20-year-old plant, alleging violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The board’s officials had alleged that the plant was fuelled by cheap, polluting Low Sulphur Heavy Stock (LSHS), and not diesel. Around 40 MW power was being generated at the plant.

Later, work on a combined cycle power plant – the only power plant in the city – was launched by the then Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in June 2016. The plant was supposed to be ready by May 2018, but faced delays.

Abdul Azeem Kalebudde, the advocate for the Yelahanka Puttenahalli Lake and Bird Conservation Trust and Heritage Estate Apartment Owners’ Association, has alleged that KPCL obtained the Environmental Clearance (EC) from the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) by “suppressing the fact that the lakes are declared as Bird Conservation Reserve”, and hence, the Environment Clearance granted by the SEIAA is “void and illegal”.

“Moreover, no information is provided as to the construction and functioning of the power plant. People in the vicinity have been experiencing vibrations continuously. There is frequent discharge of froth from the plant. Residents are exposed to some unbearable emission of gas, which is let out during the day and unknowingly at night as well. This has already created a fear psychosis among the people staying in the vicinity,” the advocate alleged. He claimed that no steps have been taken despite the matter being brought to the notice of the KSPCB and BBMP.

This July, the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered serving a notice to KPCL based on an application filed by the Trust seeking nullification and cancellation of the EC granted by the SEIAA.

V. Ponnuraj, Managing Director, KPCL said the plant will be commissioned in due course. “Generally, we keep two to three commissioning dates, and this was our first attempt. Before we commission the plant, we will wait to learn the root cause of the accident and set it right,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/une752/article32753881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGKPTCLP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/controversial-yelahanka-power-plant-to-be-commissioned-in-due-course/article32753882.ece
306,2020/10/02,Yellappa Reddy returns honorary doctorate,"The environmentalist is upset with BU’s move to allot land housing the Biodiversity Park to other institutions

Renowned environmentalist A.N. Yellappa Reddy has decided to return the honorary doctorate that was conferred on him by Bangalore University more than a decade ago. He took this decision to protest the university’s move to allot the land housing the Biodiversity Park for CBSE’s southern centre, Central University of Karnataka, Gulbarga and the Inter University Centre for Yogic Sciences

He was awarded the honorary doctorate by BU in 2009 keeping in mind his contribution towards developing the Biodiversity Park on BU’s Jnana Bharathi campus and for his efforts to protect the environment. On October 1, he handed over his doctorate to the Environmental Society of India and asked them to return it to the Governor and Chancellor of Universities Vajubhai Vala on his behalf.

Mr. Reddy told The Hindu that he was ‘deeply hurt’ by the Vice Chancellor’s decision to lease out the land without consulting him. “I was instrumental in developing the Biodiversity Park more than two decades ago. I got the doctorate for setting up this park. When this park is no more, what is the meaning of holding the doctorate? I am still the consultant of the Biodiversity Park but the Vice Chancellor did not consult me once before making this decision,” he said.

He had initially asked T.J. Renuka Prasad – the former coordinator of the biopark – to return the award to the Chancellor. However, he was not in a position to do so due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Society members have sought an appointment with the Chancellor to return the award.

The Biodiversity Park has more than 9,000 trees that have been nurtured over the years. The park is popularly known as the largest ‘oxygen bank’ in the city and has a fruit garden.

Vice Chancellor K.R. Venugopal said that 10 acres were allotted to Central University, Gulbarga, 15 acres to the University Grants Commission. “We are yet to allot one acre for the CBSE’s southern regional centre,” he said adding that he is not aware how many acres of these come within the Biodiversity Park.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/2h9kdl/article32753786.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGYELLAPPAREDDYP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/yellappa-reddy-returns-honorary-doctorate/article32753787.ece
307,2020/10/02,15 suffer burns in fire at KPCL Yelahanka power plant,"It took four fire tenders an hour to bring the blaze under control

As many as 15 employees suffered burns in a fire that broke out at the combined cycle power plant at Yelahanka early on Friday. Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. officials confirmed that they were preparing to commission the long-pending plant. Initial investigations revealed that leakage of CNG led to the accident, but experts are investigating to ascertain the exact cause.

According to fire department officials, the accidental fire broke out at the plant around 3 a.m., when employees, belonging to KPCL, BHEL, and GE, were working there. They were injured and shifted to hospital before the fire and emergency services were alerted.

It took four fire tenders one hour to bring the fire under control.

A member of the Yelahanka Puttenahalli Lake and Bird Conservation Trust and resident of the area, requesting anonymity, said there were activities in the plant since four or five days.

The fire and emergency services alleged that KPCL officials had not obtained the no-objection certificate (NOC) to carry out such an exercise. However, V. Ponnuraj, managing director, KPCL told The Hindu that the plant was being commissioned at the time of the accident. “The cause [of the fire] will be known only when we get a root cause analysis by BHEL GE. The plant was to be commissioned today or tomorrow,” he said.

When asked about allegations on NOC, he said, “There is no NOC required from the fire department. To be on the safe side, a month ago, we wanted to follow the guidelines and approached the fire department. We also wanted to know if we needed any approvals. They said we didn't need anything except fire protection systems, which we had.”

Police take up case

The Yelahanka police have taken up a case based on the complaint by a KPCL officer in charge on Friday. A police team, which visited the site to take stock of the situation, said that there was no blast.

“It was an accidental fire. A team of technical experts was doing a pre-run of the combined cycle power plant. The fire was noticed in the gas turbine following which the inbuilt fire alarm was triggered. However, the fire triggered oil leakage near the machinery,” said an officer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/une752/article32753881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGKPTCLP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fire-at-kpcl-yelahanka-power-plant-15-employees-injured/article32751705.ece
308,2020/10/02,R.R. Nagar bypoll: Name of D.K. Ravi’s wife among those doing rounds in Congress,"Talks held to choose ‘winnable’ candidate

Names of H. Kusuma, daughter of Hanumantharayappa and wife late IAS officer D.K. Ravi, former Magadi MLA H.C. Balakrishna, and Bengaluru North Congress unit president Rajkumar M. are doing the rounds in the Congress for the party’s candidate for the byelection to Rajarajeshwarinagar constituency.

KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar and his brother and Bengaluru Rural MP D.K. Suresh on Thursday huddled with leaders of a cross-section of society in the constituency to select the “winnable” candidate.

The bypolls in Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar constituencies are the first elections being held after Mr. Shivakumar assumed charge and are being seen as a matter of prestige for him.

The former Minister T.B. Jayachandra is the party’s candidate in Sira.

With Vokkaliga community members being a major chunk of the vote bank in Rajarajeshwarinagar, the party is certain to field a candidate belonging to that community. The constituency comes under the Bengaluru Rural parliamentary constituency, represented by Mr. Suresh.

Sources in the Congress said the party would announce its candidate after the BJP makes public its nominee for the seat. In the 2018, Congress candidate Munirathna won the seat. But he quit the party in 2019 and joined the BJP along with 13 other party legislators. Congress leaders have ruled out any alliance with the JD(S) to retain its seat.

Mr. Hanumantharayappa told mediapersons that he had appealed to Mr. Shivakumar to hold talks with JD(S) leaders to field a common candidate in Rajarajeshwarinagar. Mr. Hanumantharayappa along with Ms. Kusuma visited Adichunchanagiri Mutt and sought the blessings of the seer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/rr-nagar-bypoll-name-of-dk-ravis-wife-among-those-doing-rounds-in-congress/article32748310.ece
309,2020/10/02,Several CLAT candidates allege discrepancies,"They raise objections after seeing answer sheets; Consortium of National Law Universities gets around 400 complaints

Hundreds of UG Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) candidates, who saw their answer papers — assessed based on the provisional answer key — on Wednesday, have alleged that there are discrepancies.

CLAT-2020, which is the entrance test for admissions into 22 National Law Universities across the country, was held on September 28.

Candidates that The Hindu spoke to claimed that the answers they had chosen and submitted while writing the online test were different from what had been finally marked. For instance, if a candidate had chosen option ‘c’ in the test, in the answer sheet, he or she has been graded for option ‘b’.

They also alleged that they were not allotted marks even though they had attempted certain questions.

Many candidates have taken up the matter with the Consortium of National Law Universities. “I have emailed them stating that I have been awarded a lower score than what I should have got. I have been marked negatively for questions I skipped, which is not the format of the paper,” said a candidate. Another candidate who has also written to the consortium pointed out that she was supposed to get 86 marks based on the provisional answer key, but was shocked to see that her score was just 48. “My friends have reported the same discrepancy,” she said.

‘No errors found’

Balraj Chauhan, convener, CLAT-2020, told The Hindu that they had received around 400 grievances, all of which would be reviewed. He said he had looked into 150 grievances so far and no errors had been found.

“Students probably do not remember which answer they had clicked. In our investigation nothing has been found wrong so far,” he said, adding that the system was transparent. The consortium has also said that they have audit trail reports of every click.

However, candidates are unconvinced. They have urged the consortium to republish their answer sheets after verification, while some have also demanded a re-examination.

They have tagged the Union Minister for Education Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in tweets airing their grievances.

CLAT has responded to candidates stating that their concerns have been noted and their grievances will be forwarded to the examination audit department for further verification.

The consortium has formed a grievance redressal committee headed by S. Rajendra Babu, former Chief Justice of India.

Final answer key

Candidates have also raised objections to the provisional answer key. The final answer key is expected to be published on October 3.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/several-clat-candidates-allege-discrepancies/article32748283.ece
310,2020/10/02,Transgenders start organic soap unit in Chennai,"After training, they invested ₹12,000 to start the manufacturing unit in Saidapet

A transgender, Swetha Sudhakar, of Saidapet, has started an organic soap manufacturing unit along with two of her friends to develop entrepreneurs in her community and improve their lives.

The 32-year-old founder of Born To Win social welfare trust, has been working for the education, employment and empowerment of the transgender community. “Three of us - Sanavi, Sherlina and myself - attended the organic soap making training in K.K. Nagar in a centre called Creepys Cosmetics - Cosmetics Formulation Training Institute,” said Ms. Swetha.

Following it, she invested ₹12,000 and started manufacturing soap near her house in Saidapet. “We have named the brand -Trans Natural beauty products. It is made of aloe- vera. Sanvi and Sherlina take care of the manufacturing and I handle marketing and social media accounts,” she explained.

The unit was started on September 30 and on the first day itself they earned ₹3,200, she said. “The soap bar has a shelf life of one year and it is good for the skin. If someone places the order in the morning, they can get the soap by evening,” added Ms. Swetha.

Each soap costs Rs. 50. “As we develop we will employ more transgenders. This will improve our standard of living. Already we are providing tailoring training to members of our community,” she said.

313,2020/10/02,Corporation to issue EPIC for new voters from next week,"Arrangements made to deliver 27,000 voter ID cards, say officials

The Greater Chennai Corporation will start distributing Electoral Photo Identity Cards (EPIC) to new voters in the city from October first week.

The civic body had completed the three revision activities of rationalisation of polling stations, removing duplicate entries and carrying out corrections in the electoral rolls and would start distributing the voter ID cards, said officials.

A senior official of the Corporation said arrangements were made to distribute 27,000 new voter ID cards. All the booth-level officers (BLOs), including those put on COVID-19 duty, had been reassigned to complete the summary revision of the electoral rolls for 2020-21.

The civic body, as part of the electoral updating exercise, created a progress tracker for the work done by the staff with senior officials getting computer-generated reports.

He said the work of inclusion of names, correction and removal of names is being coordinated and checked by the electoral registration officers (EROs) and assistant electoral registration officers (AEROs).

Regarding complaints of voters for inclusion or carrying out corrections of any mistakes to be carried out in voters’ list, the civic official said the public could easily update the details by accessing the portal www.nsvp.in without the need to visit the corporation offices.

Although the summary revision of electoral rolls is a continuous process, a few residents had complaints of voter identification cards having errors and wrong photographs.

Complaints galore

V. Rama Rao, social activist of Nanganallur, one of the added areas to the corporation, complained that in the new EPIC issued recently some other person’s photo was affixed instead of his photo though he had not made any complaint. He rued several mistakes in the voter identification cards in the locality and charged that the revenue officials of Kancheepuram district were not taking any steps to rectify them.

Regarding the complaint raised by residents in the newly-added areas, the senior civic official said the city should be having 22 revenue districts after expansion by including portions from the neighbouring three districts but was demarcated with 16 revenue districts for electoral work. Only the Election Commission had the power to carry out delimitation of revenue districts, he said.

The proposal to link Aadhaar with EPIC was under serious consideration but a decision had not been taken by the EC till now, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xuvviu/article32748536.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THEPICCARDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corporation-to-issue-epic-for-new-voters-from-next-week/article32748537.ece
314,2020/10/02,Green tribunal orders demolition of illegal oil tanks,"Bench says CRZ clearance granted to them is illegal

The National Green Tribunal has ordered KTV Oil Mills Pvt Ltd to demolish illegal structures constructed at its storage facility on the Ennore Express High Road within three months, failing which the Tamil Nadu Coastal Zone Management Authority has been authorised to carry out their demolition.

The bench of Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta also set aside the CRZ clearance granted to the facility by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change’s expert committee as it found the clearance to be illegal.

The case relates to an appeal against the grant of CRZ clearance to the company’s facility. The applicant said the company had constructed seven tanks for storing edible oil at its facility and laid a pipeline from the Chennai Port to its storage terminal without obtaining CRZ clearance from the MoEF. CRZ clearance was issued in July 2017 for this purpose. It was challenged by the applicant, who said that there was no provision for granting ex-post facto clearance and that the practice was deprecated by the Supreme Court and the Principal bench of the NGT in several cases.

‘No illegality’

Counsel for the MoEF argued that the project was recommended for CRZ clearance with specific and general conditions to be followed and there was no illegality. The company said the storage of non-hazardous oil was a permitted activity and Chennai Port was a notified port. It said the diameter of the pipeline was 10 inches, as provided under the CRZ clearance, while the NHAI had given approval to lay a 12 inch diameter pipeline. Making a slew of observations, the bench said the CRZ clearance was issued post facto, but was treated as a fresh proposal “which in itself is not a legal procedure”.

“The Coastal Regulation Zone clearance granted to KTV Oil Mills is not permissible and liable to be set aside,” the bench ordered.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/green-tribunal-orders-demolition-of-illegal-oil-tanks/article32748508.ece

316,2020/10/02,A meal for ₹10 in Chennai,"Chennai businessman takes his cue from Ramu Thatha

Mukesh Khubchandani, a Chennai businessman, has replicated the budget canteen that was run by S. Ramu, fondly called Ramu Thatha, in Madurai, and is selling meals for ₹10.

Ramu Thatha, who passed away a few months ago, ran the budget hotel along with his wife R. Pooranathammal near the Anna bus stand in the temple city. “The day I read about the death of Madurai’s Ramu Thatha (meaning grandfather), who served meals for ₹10, I was impressed by his life journey. That is when I thought when a poor man can do this for several decades, why not me,” said Mr. Khubchandani, who is also president of the All India Electronics Association, Chennai.

In the next 30 days, he and his team did the groundwork and set up a small kitchen (345 sq ft) on Ritchie Street. The operations started in August. “The idea behind collecting ₹10 is to make the buyer realise that it is not free. This will also ensure that he does not waste food,” Mr. Khubchandani said.

The meal parcel contains rice, sambhar, rasam, buttermilk and vegetables (all packed separately).

During the initial days, 100 meals a day were sold. As word spread, more people from nearby places started coming in. Currently, over 300 meals are being sold every day, and the number is increasing. Looking at the demand, Mr. Khubchandani has deployed two persons to be in charge of the kitchen and four others to help in the packaging. He is now planning to set up a restaurant and is scouting for a location. “I’m looking for a space where there are more labourers who would walk in. At the restaurant I will be giving the meals for ₹30 (with the best ambience), and takeaways will be priced at ₹10,” he said.

317,2020/10/02,HC wants to know steps taken against drug abuse by juveniles,"‘Law enforcement agencies must concentrate on the source of such drug abuse’

The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to spell out steps it had taken against drug abuse by preventing pharmacies from selling pain killers and other drugs to minor children without a valid prescription.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan also wanted to know what was the percentage of juvenile drug addiction in the State and whether it was true that many schoolchildren were addicted to euphoria produced by pain relievers.

The Division Bench posed the questions while passing interim orders on a habeas corpus petition filed against the preventive detention of a person accused of abusing common psychoactive drugs available freely in local pharmacies.

The judges expressed surprise over the police not having included the medical shop owner as one of the accused in the criminal case and observed that hardcore criminals use juveniles to commit crimes by intoxicating the latter.

They stressed that the law enforcement agencies must concentrate on the source of such drug abuse and insisted on prosecuting the pharmacists too. They directed the police to spell out the number of such cases booked in the last 10 years.

Police was ordered to file a report within two weeks listing out the number of people arrested in such cases, the number of pharmacists shown as accused and whether proper steps were taken to suspend the licence of such pharmacists.

The judges further asked whether information regarding criminal cases booked against pharmacists were being shared with the Pharmacy Council of India, a statutory body under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, for appropriate action at its end.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-wants-to-know-steps-taken-against-drug-abuse-by-juveniles/article32748375.ece
318,2020/10/02,"91 fake NOCs were used to establish fuel outlets in T.N., High Court told","The Madras High Court was on Thursday startled to hear from the Director General of Police (DGP) that as many as 91 retail outlets of petrol, diesel and auto gas had been established across the State on the strength of fake No Objection Certificates (NOCs), reportedly issued by Collectors and Commissioners of Police.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan had called for the information after coming across a couple of habeas corpus petitions filed against the preventive detention of two individuals K.L. Sivakumar and C. Jayaprakash accused of having issued fake NOCs with the seal of the Commissioner of Police, Greater Chennai.

Suspecting that the crime could not have been be limited to Chennai, the judges directed the DGP to verify the records in all districts and submit a detailed report. Accordingly, Additional Public Prosecutor R. Prathap Kumar submitted a list before the court and said the inquiry revealed the issuance of 91 fake NOCs.

The court was informed that submission of a NOC from the Commissioner of Police, if a retail outlet was to be established within city limits, or from the Collector, if it was to be established in other places, was a prerequisite to obtain licence for the outlet from the Petroleum and Safety Explosive Organisation (PESO).

The onus of obtaining such NOCs was on the individual dealers and so Sivakumar, who was a consultant for a petroleum company, had collected huge sums of money from them and issued fake NOCs. Shocked to hear such allegations, the judges directed Assistant Solicitor General G. Karthikeyan too to look into the issue.

They directed the APP to furnish a copy of the DGP’s report to Abdul Saleem, counsel for Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and Nayara Energy Limited (formerly Essar Oil) so that he could find out if any of the 91 outlets had been established by the dealers of these three companies and initiate appropriate action.

The judges called for a report from PESO too on the issue of fake NOCs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/91-fake-nocs-were-used-to-establish-fuel-outlets-in-tn-high-court-told/article32748215.ece
319,2020/10/02,The Mahatma as an intercultural Indian,"His proximity to the East and the West proved to be fruitful; his intellectual openness helped him to live up to his ideals

There is a tendency in today’s world to think and to say that Gandhi’s ideal of non-violence is a noble idea but impractical and unrealistic. The odd thing about this affirmation is that it tends to sanctify Gandhi while rejecting his principles. However, Gandhi was not a saint; nor was he a religious leader. He was, first and foremost, an original thinker and an acute political strategist, who believed profoundly in the possibility of introducing humanity to the principle of non-violence.

A realistic hope

Gandhi’s idea of non-violence was not a dream; it was a realistic hope, armed with a dose of practical idealism; that of the global welcoming of the law of love. By saying this, he presented himself, at the same time, as an Asian who was influenced by Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, and as a person who was deeply influenced by the teachings of Jesus Christ, Socrates, Tolstoy, Ruskin and Thoreau. Thomas Merton once wrote that Mahatma Gandhi was “an alienated Asian”. Maybe so, but it is not because Gandhi learnt many things from the West that he had necessarily become a stranger to his own culture and to the traditions of the East. On the contrary, his proximity to the East and the West proved to be very fruitful and made of him, what we can call, “an intercultural Indian”. Gandhi was endowed with an intellectual openness, which helped him to learn from others, and, as a result, live up to his ideals. As such, he was not only an Indian political and moral leader but also the founding father of modern non-violence as it has been practised for the past 100 years around the globe.

Comment | Recovering Gandhi’s religious vision

Ethical mode of conduct

As such, with Gandhi, the philosophy of non-violence turned into an instrument of public dissent and a pragmatic tool of the powerless against the powerful. However, in the eyes of Gandhi, while being an instrument of conflict resolution and universal harmony, non-violence was also an essentially moral exercise. What Gandhi called the “soul force” was actually an ethical mode of conduct. As a matter of fact, he viewed non-violence essentially as an ethical commitment and a constructive political action. For Gandhi, the ethical and the political were the same. Therefore, for him, the struggle against violence and fanaticism was at the same moral level as disobeying unjust laws: it was expressed by the soul force and the pursuit of truth to uplift others. Gandhi had a profoundly ethical view of life: he recognised neither the infallible authority of texts nor the sanctity of religious traditions, but he was also the foremost critic of modern politics and its authoritarian practices. That is why, reading Gandhi today is unavoidably to rethink modern politics as a new relation between power and violence and as a way of transcending the conventional distinction between citizens and the state. It is also a move towards an inter-cultural democracy, where solidarity of differences is not compromised by mere nationalism, and democratic action is not limited by mere constitutionalism and representation. Working in this perspective, the Gandhian philosophy of non-violence finds the conventional meaning of politics as incomplete, while problematising democratic politics as a way of assigning a duty to citizens to be vigilant about the abuses of power by the state and to struggle against the “Sultanization” of political power in our contemporary societies.

Establishing a just society

On the social level, Gandhi envisioned an ideal society where social justice is done, including for the last person. This is a common world in which institutions aim to get the best out of the individual. The entire Gandhian thought in the realm of citizenship and democracy revolves around the establishment of a just society. As such, Gandhi’s idea of democracy hinges on moral growth in humankind, where an undisciplined and unrestrained individualism gives its place to an empathetic humanism. Moreover, while speaking on non-violence and democracy, Gandhi believed that humanity had to develop certain qualities such as fearlessness, non-possession and humility. The main aim was to restructure humans to suit to an inter-cultural and pluri-dimensional democracy. Gandhi’s repeated emphasis on service to all human beings from all traditions of thought was the essence of his non-violent democratic theory.

Comment | Gandhi and the audacity of hope

An approach ahead of its time

In this pluralistic approach to the dialogue of cultures and faiths, Gandhi was far ahead of his time. Indeed, his non-violent democratic theory as a philosophy of inter-cultural dialogue is still far ahead of our time, several generations after his death. Gandhi was not a dogmatic nationalist but essentially a pathfinder towards a common ground among different cultures and diverse mentalities. Therefore, his philosophy of democracy remains neither mono-cultural nor essentialist. It is essentially pluralistic and empathetic. More importantly, his attachment to politics is more ethical than religious. Consequently, religion for him is identified with ethics rather than theology. Therefore, his concept of democracy and modes and methods of achieving it, including Satyagraha and Swaraj, are not theological concepts. Gandhi believes that human destiny has constantly been on the move towards a non-theological truth. And he was a person who pursued truth in all aspects of life, not only spirituality, and encouraged others to join him in this pursuit.

Also Read Celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary

Gandhi considered democracy as a dynamic element in the ethical becoming of human civilisation. His effort to bridge different views of life was matched in many ways by his approach to the many-sidedness of truth. That is why he did not reject different traditions of social life; he simply affirmed what he considered to be authentic in them and thought of bringing them together in the realisation of an ethical common ground. This enabled him to maintain that it would not be possible to understand the concept of democracy without having some understanding of the philosophical tradition of a critique of violence in which it is nurtured. Gandhi, therefore, speaks of democracy and non-violence as two sides of the same reality.

Comment | Gandhi: a fox or a hedgehog?

Idea of ‘Indianness’

He defined his mission of promoting non-violence and democracy in India beyond all political and philosophical sources of hatred, exclusion, suspicion and war. He was well aware of the fact that politics is a fragile concept and is vulnerable to nationalist justifications of violence and war. That is the reason why he refused to define India in terms of ethnic purity or linguistic unity or some other unifying religious attribute. More than rallying Indians to combat various “others,” Gandhi’s philosophy of democracy introduced an anti-monistic and pluralistic dimension into a primarily territorial rootedness of Indianness. In this sense, it could be argued that for Gandhi, there was no sentiment of loving one’s country (namely India) without loving the culture of the other. Gandhi’s appeal to planetary companionship was based on an inclusive and dialogical idea of living together which disapproved all forms of national or religious self-centredness. As he pointed out: “The golden way is to be friends with the world and to regard the whole human family as one. He who distinguishes between the votaries of one’s own religion and those of another miss-educates the members of his own and opens the way for discord and irreligion.”

320,2020/10/02,The Prime Minister India almost forgot,"Lal Bahadur Shastri’s political life has lessons, but it is his sudden passing that vitiates his public recall and his history

Sharing his birthday with Gandhi and coming from the province of Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri was the self-effacing layman who became India’s second Prime Minister (1964-66). His climb atop the greasy pole of politics was preceded by nearly 40 years of participation in the freedom movements of the Indian National Congress and independent governments. However, his seemingly unlikely ascent to that office and his untimely demise led him to be overshadowed by his long-serving predecessor and successor.

Consequently, in the political game current of historical appropriation from colonial and post-colonial India, both his life and death have found an echo in print and on screen. Thus, first eclipsed and now enlarged, Shastri’s prime ministership and its major preoccupations of the language movement, the lack of food, war and peace and economic crises are easy to either forget or fabricate.

Comment | Babuji, my guide

Setting the bar

Before that, as the Minister who resigned twice, assuming moral responsibility for railway accidents in 1956 (Mahbubnagar, Andhra Pradesh and Ariyalur, Tamil Nadu) and setting an early standard, Shastri was one of six who left their cabinet posts in 1963 to work in the party organisation under the Kamaraj Plan. He was the only one though who was recalled by an ailing Prime Minister in January 1964 in a roving capacity, and, within six months, was unanimously elevated as Nehru’s successor, upon his death. In between, in a poll conducted by the Indian Institute of Public Opinion, he had received almost half the votes to fill the role. These instances make him more and not less likely an answer to that question After Nehru, Who? His matter-of-fact conduct in office was in the face of not just testing circumstances but also the individual challenge of stepping out of the shadow of his predecessor.

Quiet change on many fronts

Revisiting Shastri’s premiership repays an attempt to put things in perspective, as arguably his tenure was one of quiet change on most fronts. It began amid a renewed bout of food scarcity and resultant price rise which can be taken back, albeit in a broken line, to the days of the Second World War and placed in a wider frame of similar problems across the decolonised world. More prosaically, it caused a forex crisis from food procurement and a provincial friction between surplus and deficit zones, and saw piecemeal rationing as well as the construction of the Food Corporation of India on the way to an eventual ‘Green Revolution’. Such systemic challenges and the structural response to them require organisational consensus and federal cooperation as much as prime ministerial control. This was more so in the mid-1960s when the monolithising days of the Congress’ clientele ‘system’ were on their last legs, afflicted by a generational churn among its regional satraps.

Shastri’s selection as Prime Minister was itself an affirmation of the party’s organisation and self-correcting mechanism, notwithstanding its moral ambiguities and patronage politics. In his own unflashy ways, Shastri would put his imprimatur to weigh down on the corruption-induced departures of stalwarts such as Punjab’s Chief Minister Partap Singh Kairon, Orissa’s Chief Minister Biren Mitra and Union Finance Minister T.T. Krishnamachari.

Review | Lal Bahadur Shastri: Politics and Beyond — Living by the values of agreement

Equally, he also had a mentoring side to him, exhibited in his encouragement of the party’s Bureau of Parliamentary Research, as a former beneficiary. A third domain was the party’s factionalism and its contrasting framing of him as either a leader of too much discussion and indecision, or of too little consultation and consensus. Indeed, clichés abound, when it comes to Shastri’s past and present: small man, stopgap, original accidental premier, cardboard nationalist.

Many challenges

As a report card of Shastri’s first year of premiership highlighted, the language violence in Tamil Nadu, youth challenges in Orissa, returning President’s rule in Kerala, persisting feuds in Uttar Pradesh, enduring demand for a Punjabi suba and continuing farce in Kashmir, were some of the question marks at the cross-section of nation, region and institution for the Prime Minister. In the international arena too, Shastri had to navigate between a subdued Non-Aligned Movement, the now-nuclear challenge of China, a change in the Soviet leadership, a new leader in Pakistan, President Ayub Khan and an Anglo-American-Commonwealth combine distracted with varied issues such as Vietnam and Southern Rhodesia. Fittingly, for a person whose first foray in foreign affairs had been to Nepal, the first fruit of Shastri’s diplomacy was the agreement with then-Ceylon on persons of Indian origin there — an endorsement of the importance of neighbourhood.

Comment | When India found a leader, but lost a statesman

Handling Pakistan

If this attention to the neighbour nearby than an ally far was a virtue initially, it became a necessity in the year of war(s), i.e., 1965. First, in spring-summer was the Rann of Kutch dispute with Pakistan, where a combination of its remoteness, reciprocal military situation on the ground, a relatively straightforward question of overdue boundary determination, and successful British mediation meant that Shastri was content with a reasonable reference to an international tribunal, which eventually gave India the lion’s share of the demarcated territory. However, it was in August, 18 years from their Independence and Partition, that India and Pakistan came to their first, declared war over that unfinished business from 1947: Jammu and Kashmir. As it followed, familiar tropes of infiltration and mopping up, crossover and confrontation, critical calculations of cooperation from the one side and suspicions of collaboration from the other, failed to materialise.

Instead, clashes around the then-Ceasefire Line broadened to battles across the international border in Punjab in the first week of September 1965, for which Shastri was then and now hailed for his resolve. Prepared for a prolonged war, he resisted indiscriminate international intercession, restrained internal war fever especially its potential to deteriorate in communal outbreaks, remained firm through the retreats in one sector and the advances in another in the war’s widening arc, and rallied the country with his call of ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kisan’ to become his epitaph.

In the end, he accepted the Soviet offer for mediation and set about the road to Tashkent, where an agreement was signed with his Pakistani counterpart, President Muhammad Ayub Khan in January 1966, more or less restoring the status quo. It was there that he died, within hours of their declared denouement to war. The image of a sombre Ayub carrying the coffin of Shastri was a big symbolic testimony to his short but substantial stature.

Among the highlights of Shastri’s heritage is the shift from personalised to institutionalised government; the laying of stress from industry to agriculture, and a move from command to economy, all overtaken by the march of time. His quiet ascent to prime ministership and his loud actions as Prime Minister fell through the cracks between the Nehruvian era and Indira’s India. His motivated resurrection, in an outsized opposition to these narratives, by those whose grandiose rhetoric sits oddly with his dignified reality, is his current fate. His political life has lessons but, unfortunately, it is his sudden death that has caused conspiracies and vitiates his public recall, doing little justice to his history.

Like most in his time, he rose humbly from the provinces in national politics, and carried his convictions from his faith in people, their constitution and representation. Crucially, he remained modest in both his personal probity and policy making and was not invested solely in his occupancy of his office.

The judgment in the Babri Masjid case is as heinous as the demolition itself (Page 1, “Advani, 31 others acquitted in Babri case”, October 1). It would be no exaggeration to say that the verdict has only demolished people’s belief in courts as an impartial and fair institution. To say that there is no evidence of conspiracy leaves one stunned in cynical disbelief that the demolition was indeed part of a larger conspiracy. It is noteworthy that of late, almost all judgments on crucial matters have created the perception of being in favour of the ruling party — which is not a good sign. Courts have to remind themselves that they are constitutional functionaries and not constituted functionaries.

Finally, the only answer to a rath yatra is a pada yatra; to bring about systemic change, one has to start addressing the people before addressing the courts.

322,2020/10/02,"‘Orey Bujjiga’ movie review: Been there, seen that","The Telugu rom-com rides on an old, predictable tale

Orey Bujjiga, streaming on Aha, was initially scheduled to release in theatres for Ugadi. Had COVID-19 not played spoilsport, it would have been one of those films that never aimed high, but managed to give its viewers a few laughs during a festive weekend. The film doesn’t take itself too seriously and hopes that the viewers too will give in to the light-hearted fun and overlook its pitfalls.

Orey Bujjiga Cast: Raj Tarun, Malvika Nair and Hebah Patel

Direction: Vijay Kumar Konda

Music: Anup Rubens

Streaming on: Aha

Director Vijay Kumar Konda takes up a story that feels like a mix of several situations, characters and plot points of films in the mid-90s or early 2000s. Sreenu alias Bujji (Raj Tarun) takes the first train out of Nidadavolu when the first talk of wedding crops up at home; his heart is set on someone else. Krishnaveni (Malvika Nair) takes the same train to run away from her impending wedding. Someone spots the two on the train platform and assumes that they are a couple on the run.

The two, though, don’t know each other. They meet on the train, and she doesn’t reveal her true identity. Anyone who has watched mainstream entertainers would know that the two will inevitably fall in love, after a spate of incidents that intentionally and unintentionally evoke laughter.

The families are at loggerheads. Posani Krishna Murali as Bujji’s father is at the receiving end of the wrath of Krishnaveni’s mother (Vani Vishwanath). Bujji has to trace Krishnaveni and prove that he has nothing to do with her running away from home, to save his dad’s fortunes. And Krishnaveni has to find Bujji to prove her side of the story.

The initial hour or so is packed with laugh-aloud moments. There’s nothing too striking, but it’s not bad either. Sid Sriram is also called in to add his charming touch to the blossoming romance through the song ‘Ee May Peremito’ (composed by Anup Rubens).

However, the later portions become a drag. The hospital scene involving Sapthagiri and Raj Tarun begins on a fun note but goes on and on until you feel like giving up with the rest of the film.

Apart from a few comic segments that overstay their welcome, the lack of depth to some of the characters makes the film disappointing. On paper, Vani Vishwanath’s character might have appeared like a complex woman of power, but it doesn’t translate well on screen.

Raj Tarun portrays an effervescent youngster as usual and Malvika gets ample scope to show that she can also be good in fun parts. The portions that show her as a pragmatic young woman who knows to guard herself on social media deserve a mention. Hebah Patel is effortless in her brief appearance as an opportunist.

324,2020/10/02,Anurag Kashyap denies sexual harassment allegations,"He provides evidence to show that he was in Sri Lanka in August 2013

Film-maker Anurag Kashyap has vehemently denied all allegations of sexually harassing an actor in 2013. He provided documentary evidence to the Mumbai Police showing that he was in Sri Lanka throughout August that year.

After the actor alleged that he had raped her, the Versova police station issued summons to Mr. Kashyap. On Thursday, he appeared before the police station to record his statement.

He was quizzed for eight hours, and he denied all wrongdoing in the matter. The police recorded his statement, in which Mr. Kashyap said that the complaint was an “outright lie”. He also provided documentary proof of the fact that throughout August 2013, he was away in Sri Lanka in connection with the shooting of one of his films.

A statement was released by his lawyer Priyanka Khimani on Friday, which said, “These sudden, belated allegations of an alleged incident of August 2013 have been widely publicised by the complainant for the purpose of vilifying Mr. Kashyap, irrespective of the outcome of the judicial process. He has sought severe action against the complainant for misusing the criminal justice system and for hijacking the Me Too Movement for her ulterior motives.”

The statement further said, “Mr. Kashyap is confident that the falsity of the complaint has been exposed, not only by the evidence presented by Mr. Kashyap, but also the ever-shifting version of events put forth by the complainant in the media. Mr. Kashyap is apprehensive that now that the falsity of her allegations in the FIR have been established, she will alter her version of events in the investigation process as well.”

“Mr. Kashyap is distressed with the false and reckless allegations made against him that have caused pain to him, his family and his fans.

325,2020/10/02,Second sero survey indicates drop in infections in Mumbai slums,"The presence of COVID-19 antibodies in samples from slums in the city was found to have decreased by 12% in the second sero survey, the Mumbai civic body has said.

It indicates that the infection spread in slums in the city may have come down, said the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in a release here on Thursday night.

Presence of anti-bodies in the blood indicates that the person has been exposed to an infection — in this case coronavirus.

The latest survey disclosed that “sero-prevalence” of COVID-19 infection in slums is 45%, compared to 57% in the first sero-survey in the city (in July), the release said.

The sero-prevalence in buildings was around 18% against 16% in the first survey, it added.

The latest survey was carried out in wards R-north (Borivali), M-West (Mankhurd and Govandi) and F-North (Worli and Lower Parel) in the second half of August.

“Sero-positivity from the second round, taken together with the current number of reported cases from slum areas in these wards, indicates there could be a reduction in the spread of infection in slum areas,” said the BMC.

The sero-prevalence of COVID-19 infection in women was marginally higher than men in both the rounds, it said.

In the second survey, sero-prevalence in the age group above 40 was slightly higher.

“Emerging scientific evidence hints at fall of antibody levels in recovered patients/asymptomatic patients over a period of time and this might have contributed to the trend between two rounds of sero-survey. The impact of this on immunity, if any, is still unknown,” the release said.

Sero-prevalence among health care workers in both the rounds was approximately 27%.

The survey had been commissioned by the BMC, NITI- Aayog and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR).

Kasturba Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), A.T.E. Chandra Foundation and IDFC Institute had also partnered in the survey.

327,2020/10/02,NCP condemns police action against Rahul Gandhi,"Those who are supposed to uphold the law trample upon democratic values: Pawar

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar on Thursday condemned the Uttar Pradesh police for their “reckless” behaviour towards Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

“It is reprehensible that those who are supposed to uphold the law trample upon the democratic values in such a manner,” said Mr. Pawar, extending support to Mr. Gandhi who was reportedly manhandled on Thursday by the police in U.P. while he was on his way to meet the family members of the gang rape victim in Hathras.

The entire NCP leadership condemned the U.P. police action. Lok Sabha MP Supriya Sule said she condemns the treatment given to a fellow MP. “Irrespective of politics, the administration must take swift action when a heinous crime like rape takes place. Rahul Gandhi was going to meet the family and I condemn the suppression from the U.P. government,” she said.

The Maharashtra State unit Congress organised a protest against the Uttar Pradesh government in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue near Mantralaya. “What happened with Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi today has once again proved there is utter lawlessness in Uttar Pradesh and it is not a State that runs by the book of law, there is jungle raaj there,” said Congress committee president Balasaheb Thorat.

Congress leaders also condemned the action and demanded the resignation of Chief minister Yogi Adityanath. “CM Yogi, who is also the head of the Home Ministry, has failed to save the daughters of U.P. and should resign with immediate effect,” said Mumbai Congress spokesperson Ramkishore Trivedi, demanding strict action against those who used force against Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ncp-condemns-police-action-against-rahul-gandhi/article32748379.ece
328,2020/10/02,"After taking shelter, runaway boy flees with bag of gold from caterer’s house","Juvenile traced to chawl in Jogeshwari where he was hiding

A 17-year-old runaway boy who had been staying with a caterer in Vashi for over six months fled with a bag of gold jewellery worth ₹2.49 lakh on Sunday.

According to the police, the juvenile who had run away from his home in Uttar Pradesh was noticed by a co-passenger in train. The boy told him that he was an orphan and stayed with his uncle and aunt. The aunt tortured him and hence, he fled from their house.

The co-passenger, who was known to the caterer Prakash Bhagwat, called him and asked if he could keep the boy at his place. Mr. Bhagwat agreed to keep him for a few days. On March 10, the boy was brought to Mr. Bhagwat’s house and after a few days, the lockdown was enforced.

The boy started helping Mr. Bhagwat in his business and also gave company to his 14-year-old son. “Mr. Bhagwat left for his home town in Rajasthan with his family and also took the boy there. Over there, the boy borrowed Mr. Bhagwat’s mobile phone frequently claiming that he had to make a call to his friend. Mr. Bhagwat also received calls enquiring about the boy. On asking the caller, Mr. Bhagwat learnt that it was the boy’s elder brother,” assistant police inspector Sachin Dhage from Vashi police station said. The elder brother also revealed that the boy was not an orphan and had failed Class X for the second consecutive time and hence, he fled home when he was confronted.

Mr. Bhagwat told his brother that he would send him back by October 1, and in the last week of September, he came back from Rajasthan.

After the boy ran away with the gold on Sunday, a case of theft was registered at the Vashi police station. The police informed his elder brother and asked him to call them if he contacted him. On realising that the elder brother would not cooperate, the police tracked the call records of the elder brother and found that the juvenile had been constantly calling him from various numbers. The boy was finally traced to a chawl in Jogeshwari (East) where he was hiding.

“We recovered all the stolen jewellery from his possession. He was sent to a juvenile home from where he was released on bail and handed over to the custody of his brother,” Mr. Dhage said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/after-taking-shelter-runaway-boy-flees-with-bag-of-gold-from-caterers-house/article32748022.ece
329,2020/10/02,Six held for robbing truck on Mumbai-Goa highway,"The Raigad police have arrested a gang of six people for kidnapping and dacoity on the Mumbai-Goa highway at Pen on September 14. The accused had robbed a truck of plastic raw materials worth ₹40 lakh after holding the truck occupants as hostages. The accused had assaulted the occupants and drove them around for three hours in an SUV before dumping them along the highway.

Chandrakant Gunge (32) was transporting plastic beads in a 14-wheeler truck to Chennai for a company on September 14. Around 7.30 p.m., a group of nine people travelling in an SUV overtook Mr. Gunge’s truck near Gagode Khind in Pen and forced themselves inside the truck. The nine then beat up Mr. Gunge and his two attendants, and robbed them of their valuables before putting them into their vehicle.

“The trio were blindfolded and tied up when the accused put them inside the SUV. For around three hours, the accused drove the vehicle and then abandoned them at Eerwadi which is around 15 km from the place where the incident occurred. We found the empty truck dumped in an area in Nashik under the Malegaon taluka police. We first arrested Sadanand Amritka, one of the accused,” Raigad Superintendent of Police Anil Paraskar said.

Five others were arrested from Nashik and Mumbai, and the stolen plastic was recovered in Nashik. The five have been identified as Shahanshah Gulhasan (20), Hansraj Munneshwar (48) and Mohammed Zakir Iliyas (20) from Mumbai, Roshan Khabia (33) from Nashik, and Mohammed Javir Shaikh (28) from Uttar Pradesh. The police are searching for the other three gang members.

According to the police, the modus operandi of the gang was to steal the whole consignment of goods in truck by kidnapping and then abandoning the truck occupants. The target was randomly decided and the stolen goods were then sold to different customers. The accused used to rent the SUV for committing the crime.

The accused were arrested under sections of dacoity, kidnapping, wrongful restraint, and assault of the Indian Penal Code.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/six-held-for-robbing-truck-on-mumbai-goa-highway/article32747960.ece
330,2020/10/02,Derogatory tweets against CM: man gets interim protection from arrest,"The Bombay High Court on Thursday granted interim protection from arrest to a man booked for derogatory tweets against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and his son and Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray.

A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and M.S. Karnik was hearing a petition filed by a Nagpur resident, Sameet Thakkar, seeking to quash an FIR registered against him by the V.P. Marg police charging him for obscenity and slander over his tweets.

Advocate Abhinav Chandrachud, appearing for Mr. Thakkar, said obscenity under Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code means only sexual obscenity or pornography. “Mere abusive language does not amount to obscenity. There are great works of literature that have abusive language within them,” he said.

The court said, “We ignore the harsh criticism that is often levelled against us, but what if others who are in power are not able to ignore/are more sensitive.”

Mr. Chandrachud said, “Those who occupy positions of power must develop a thick skin.”

The Bench then said, “What about the dignity of the post of Chief Minister? That must be maintained.”

Mr. Chanrachud argued, “The office of Chief Minister is such a high post. Its dignity cannot be reduced by a person on the street or on Twitter who abuses the Chief Minister.”

The court directed the assistant public prosecutor not to arrest the accused as Section 41A (notice of appearance before police officer) of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been invoked, and 41A doesn’t contemplate arrest.

The court also said, “If the police wish to add any cognisable offences (the FIR invoked only bailable offences), they should not arrest the accused until the next date.”

The court also directed Mr. Thakkar to be present before the investigating officer concerned on October 5 so that his statement could be recorded, and adjourned the matter to be heard on October 8.

In another matter, the Bench was hearing a petition filed by one Sunaina Holey who had been charged for tweeting against the CM and his son. The court was informed that the investigating officer at the Azad Maidan police station where Ms. Holey was expected to go to record her statement had contracted COVID 19 and that a fresh notice would be issued for her.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/derogatory-tweets-against-cm-man-gets-interim-protection-from-arrest/article32747944.ece

332,2020/10/02,"If home is ready, buyer is ready","Industry expert Shrinivas Rao says residential real estate market will pick up pace gradually in the next six months, despite the pandemic impact

The real estate industry is passing through its toughest phase. It is now that the import of institutional investors is felt for the sustenance of the industry, say market observers. “We believe, the COVID-19 crisis notwithstanding, there exists good potential for funds looking for productive deals. Going forward, most of the capital will be infused into emerging assets classes such as warehousing and logistics and affordable housing, and their growth will gradually bring back traction to the market,” says Shrinivas Rao, a founding member and presently CEO of Vestian Global Workplace Services, who has 25 years of experience in the global real estate industry.

According to Mr. Shrinivas Rao, “COVID-19 further came as a dampener to the market in Karnataka which was already lagging significantly on the affordable housing front and was expecting to pick up pace, both on the developer and the buyer front.”

Speaking on a range of issues that have bogged the market in Bengaluru including liquidity crunch in the sector to GST rates that had slackened the sector’s growth in the residential segment in the past few years, Mr. Shrinivas is hopeful that the residential market will pick up pace gradually in the next six months. “The upcoming festive season is expected to witness a fair quantum of traction in the market as well,” he says in an interview to The Hindu Property Plus.

Excerpts…

With extended timelines of construction / projects, what is the impact you foresee on sales of residential units as there is a long wait for approvals too in construction?

Construction activities across the country have been constrained severely on account of the lockdowns, labour unavailability and social distancing norms in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. This may have an impact on future available supply, if the COVID-19 crisis continues unabated and construction activity continues to be restricted. Residential projects that had been planned for delivery during the period 2020-2022 may be delayed. As such, buyer demand for ready properties may pick up faster than in under-construction projects with extended completion timelines.

How long do you think it will take for the industry to wake up?

With government initiatives such as the SWAMIH stressed asset fund focusing on last mile funding of developers with stalled projects, the RBI reducing key interest rates and bringing in targeted long-term repo operations to ease liquidity in the system, moratorium on loans, and RERA timeline extensions, the residential market is expected to pick up pace gradually in the next six months. The upcoming festive season is expected to witness a fair quantum of traction in the market as well, particularly in the affordable and mid-income housing, with developers offering a variety of offers to boost sales.

What about the residential projects that are stalled - the higher pricing expected (as funds for developers would have receded too) - and the repercussions of wait on people who have booked?

According to government estimates, there are 4.58 lakh stalled housing units in 1,509 residential projects across the country. While the Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal has said that developers needed to sell residential projects at reduced prices to lower high-priced unsold stock, there is, however, limited scope to cut prices. With most home buyers fence-sitting and sources of liquidity fast drying up, the residential sector was already in a tough phase. The situation has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis as labour shortage and supply of construction materials imported from China is impeded on account of the pandemic. The rising tension between the two countries would lead to a further constricted situation. So, with developers seeking alternative sources to meet their building requirements, and with increasing material cost, the chances of prices for under-construction projects coming down substantially is rather slim.

On the other hand, prices of ready properties held by stressed developers have reduced, particularly in markets with high levels of unsold inventory. While Bengaluru has not witnessed much of a price decline, housing prices in cities such as Mumbai have corrected by at least 10-15%.

Meanwhile, with lockdown stalling construction, people who had already booked homes are bracing themselves for further delay in the possession of their properties.

When the funding rate increases, so will the cost factor for the buyer in any residential dealing, isn’t it? Add to this the cost of construction material, for example. What percentage of hike would make sense for a buyer now? Also, there are rumours of builders offering discounts to see projects getting picked up?

With increase in funding rate and construction material, the cost of construction too increases for the developer. However, it is totally up to the developer to decide upon the percentage of price hike in view of market conditions and saleability. Regarding the rumours, several builders are actually providing discounts and various other offers in order to try selling their inventory sooner rather than later, to avoid higher interest costs.

According to a cement sector report shared with the media, cement prices have declined owing to non-demand. Demand in the south regions in Kerala, some parts of Karnataka, Andhra and Telangana is affected by heavy monsoon, and pan-India cement production has declined by 13.5 per cent as of July 2020. What bearing will such things have on residential prices?

Softening of cement prices would decrease construction costs but would be offset by increase in additional costs such as labour as well as other construction materials, leading to an overall increase in construction cost.

Would Bengaluru’s unsold inventory of residential see a huge spike if the majority of builders decide on not cutting down prices? What is the position of inventory pile-up in the city?

It has been observed that buyers in Bengaluru are actively looking for houses even during such challenging times as the COVID pandemic, primarily through web portals. According to industry reports, housing enquiries in Bengaluru have almost reached 70% of the pre-COVID-19 level. Thus, the city residential market is expected to revive soon, without adding substantially to the unsold inventory. A key factor that would work for the city’s housing segment is that prices in most markets are relatively affordable to their target categories. The price appreciation in the past has been prudent enough not to create drastic market upheaval. Presently, buyers have been adopting a cautious stance primarily on account of job uncertainty brought forth by the COVID-19 outbreak, amongst others.

And regarding the pile-up, presently, there are around 65,000 unsold housing units in the city. This translates to about 8 quarters of inventory overhang. Given the decline of new project launches and developers focussing on completion of under-construction projects, we project a steady decline in the unsold housing unit numbers to a healthier number.

What is the scene in home loan disbursals? Will the slowdown seen have effects on the economy?

Home loan disbursements came to a standstill amid the COVID-19-induced lockdown as in a housing loan, unless the property is seen and a physical verification done, along with submission of legal documents and signature of customers, the loan cannot be disbursed.

Further, the moratorium allowed to customers regarding their loans prevented banks and HFCs from collecting repayments. Consequently, the blow from the pandemic was largely on the individual loan book growth. As per HDFC Ltd, retail loans grew by 11% in the June quarter, down from 14% in the previous quarter. The share of individual loans in incremental disbursals dropped sharply to 17% from the average 80-90% in the previous quarters. With the lockdown being lifted gradually, home loan disbursements are expected to improve, though the road to normalcy is likely to be a long one. It is anticipated that disbursements may come back to near normalcy by early next year. Meanwhile, there have been applications for extension of the moratorium period. HDFC and many other non-banks would be hit significantly if it is extended or the loans are restructured as per RBI guidelines, as loan growth already is hard to come by, especially from the crisis-hit real estate sector.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/p3e4b7/article32754380.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGPSALE4,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/if-home-is-ready-buyer-is-ready/article32754382.ece
333,2020/10/02,Choosing a colour for your accent wall,"Teja Lele Desai on unusual shades to explore for your living room accent wall

An accent wall adds immediate impact to any room. Make your living room striking by shunning the regular colour choices and opting for one of these fresh ones.

May we suggest getting the family together to give the accent wall a makeover? It’s something exciting to do in these times when the pandemic has put us all under house arrest.

1. Ebony

It is generally believed that dark colours make spaces look smaller. But, deep, dark colours can add to the illusion of space and might be perfect for smaller living rooms. Let’s not forget the intimate and cozy touch ebony gives.

2. Mustard

It may be an unexpected take, but the shade promises to be a winner if your space has furniture and décor items of earthy hues.

Extremely Mediterranean in nature, we think.

3. Wine

Wine and similar purples go well with formal spaces and that’s why are perfect apt for your living room.

If your drawing room has sparkly items such as a crystal chandelier, a dark purple shade will add richness. Conversations in such settings are known to last long into the night.

4. Fire engine red

There is nothing to be alarmed about this. Red is said to invigorate and enliven activity so use this shade to give your room a jolt of energy.

The intensity created by a bold red is matched by very few colours. You can tone down the other accessories if the room appears extra loud.

5. Graphite

Grey walls have the ability to highlight pretty architectural detailing that would otherwise go unnoticed with other colours.

If you are going for grey, you may want to paint everything the same shade and not leave out the trim or borders. This will help the eye move over the entire space as a whole.

6. Rouge

If your personality is vivacious, a bright pink may be your colour. Add a splash of colour to your living room with poppy pink and you will find your living room becoming the hot spot for everything lively!

If the pink looks too glaring, you can tone it down to a peachy pink.

7. Emerald

You can play with green if your furniture is unassuming. A rich emerald green can give the room a magnificent character clubbed with a few thoughtfully placed gold details. Visually stunning, we say.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/mttcva/article32750963.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-950771872,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/choosing-a-colour-for-your-accent-wall/article32750964.ece
334,2020/10/02,Draft to set up Agriculture University ready,"The bill has been drafted based on the Model Act of Agricultural Universities prepared by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, an official said.

The government is ready with the draft of the bill to establish an agricultural sciences University in the Union Territory.

The draft of the bill to set up the Puducherry Agricultural Sciences University, initially prepared by the Secretariat (Agriculture wing) has subsequently gone through scrutiny by the Directorate of Technical Education and vetting by the Law Department, a senior official told The Hindu.

The bill has been drafted based on the Model Act of Agricultural Universities prepared by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, the official said.

“Now, it has to be placed before cabinet for approval and then clearance by the Centre before placing it before the Legislative Assembly. The government is hopeful of setting up the University during 2021-22,” he added.

The government is yet to take a call on whether the University would be established at Puducherry or Karaikal regions, said a ruling party member.

After the establishment of the University, the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru College of Agriculture and Research Institute at Karaikal, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Veterinary Education and Research and the Krishi Vigyan Kendras in both the regions would come under the control of the University, he added.

Once realised, the Agriculture University would be the second such educational institution after upgrading Pondicherry Engineering College into a Technical University.

Meanwhile, the government is also planning to start a Ph.D programme in Agricultural Economics and increase seats in B.Sc (Agri) by 60 and B.Sc (Horti) by 40 in the Agriculture College. There is also a plan to start diploma courses in Agriculture and Horticulture, the official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/draft-to-set-up-agriculture-university-ready/article32751472.ece
335,2020/10/02,Doctors and nurses at MCH go on strike,"They allege that the plight of one of their patients was due to the lack of human resources provided by the government.

The medical faculty and a section of the nursing staff at the Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, went on a flash strike and demonstration inside the hospital campus on Friday, soon after the Government issued orders placing a doctor and two head nurses in suspension with immediate effect, pending disciplinary action, in connection with the alleged negligence committed in the care of a patient at the MCH.

The Government issued the suspension orders on the basis of a report filed by the Director of Medical Education regarding the negligence that was committed in the care of an elderly patient, Anilkumar, who had been admitted in the COVID ward recently.

A stroke patient, Anilkumar, had been referred to the MCH from the Peroorkada district model hospital.

However, after he tested positive for COVID-19, he had been admitted in the COVID ward and since all his family members had been asked to go into quarantine, he was in the ward without any care-givers.

Anilkumar’s family had complained to the Health Minister that the patient, when discharged and brought home, was emaciated and covered in bed sores, with maggot-infested wounds. The visuals of the patient’s plight, as seen on news channels, had evoked outrage.

Following this, the Health Minister had ordered and immediate enquiry into the incident .

The medical faculty and nurses have however taken exception to the Government’s decision to suspend Dr. Aruna, nodal officer in charge of supervision of the COVID ward and two head nurses, Leena Kunjan and K. V. Rajani, because they point out that the negligence in care had happened because of the acute shortage of support staff in the MCH.

They said that the Government had been informed time and again about the shortage of nursing assistants, staff nurses and other ancillary staff at MCH, especially after the institution was made a COVID hospital.

The number of COVID-19 patients have been going up steadily at the MCH and though new wards and ICUs were being opened up to accommodate patients, the Government was paying scant attention to the fact that these wards and ICUs could be run only if the hospital is provided adequate human resources too, they pointed out.

The nurses’ unions and the Kerala Government Medical College Teachers’ Association said that the MCH authorities had formally written to the Government, detailing how the human resources shortage in the hospital was affecting patient care but that the Government had chosen not to do any thing.

They held the Government responsible for the plight of Anilkumar, which would not have happened if sufficient support staff had been available in the wards.

“The hospital is working with a staff pattern that is decades old and during the pre-pandemic period, the nursing care in wards was being managed with the assistance of the family members of patients. However, during the COVID period, allowing caregivers from outside was not possible and as patients with multi-morbidities were being cared for, most nursing care was focussed there,” KGMCTA said in a letter given to the DME.

The doctors accused the authorities of turning a blind eye to the fact that they were engaged in the care of a lot of non-Covid patients in serious medical conditions too.

The doctors, as a mark of protest against the suspension order issued to their colleague, have decided to organise a 48-hour relay hunger fast to draw the Government’s attention to the issue of human resources shortage. They said that unless the suspension order is revoked and steps taken immediately to resolve the crisis, they would be forced to go into an agitation, boycotting all non-COVID duties.

The nurses are also observing a “Black Day” on Saturday ion protest against the action taken against their colleagues.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/doctors-and-nurses-at-mch-go-on-strike/article32752327.ece

The city Corporation will be recommending to the State government to give contingent worker status to contract workers who have been working on daily wages for the local body for years. Those being considered include mostly those who have been working with the civic body for more than one or two decades.

“We have many who were appointed for the upkeep of the Vilappilsala waste treatment plant. When the plant closed down, they were accommodated as sanitation workers on daily wages. There are others who were hired as data entry operators in the early days of computerisation at the Corporation. Since there was no post for data entry operators at that time, even they were hired on daily wages and continued to be so. Similar is the case of some drivers too,” said a Corporation official.

A condition

As many as 135 people are estimated to be included on the list. To avoid allegations of favouritism, only those who have been working in the Corporation before the end of the previous council’s term in 2015 are being considered.

Some of these temporary sanitation workers are now part of the Corporation's rapid response team, which handles COVID-19 pandemic related activities including burial of dead bodies and disinfection of public spaces and institutions.

BJP’s opposition

Yet, there has been some opposition from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillors to the proposal. When this matter was presented in the council meeting recently, some of the BJP councillors opposed the move.

But, due to technical issues, the council meeting itself did not proceed further. The opposition had demanded that a normal council meeting, rather than an online conference as on Saturday, should be convened to discuss the issues.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/corporation-daily-wagers-likely-to-be-made-contingent-workers/article32749798.ece

NABARD loan will be available for the projects.

The government aimed at increasing the number of cattle heads in the State as part of the project.

53 panchayats covered

He was inaugurating the extension of the Ksheeragramam, a dairy development project, to 25 more panchayats through videoconference here on Thursday. Fifty-three panchayats are at present the beneficiaries of the Ksheeragramam project.

Mr. Vijayan said ₹50 lakh was spent for select panchayats. Interventions in the dairy sector had yielded good results. While 87 lakh litres of milk was the daily requirement, 82 lakh litres was being produced within the State.

New entrepreneurs

Till date, 3,140 milk-yielding cows and 535 heifers had been brought here from other States.

Their multiplication had led to an increase in milk production, he said.

After attempts to erect the memorial near the Shanghumughom beach fell flat due to land-related objections, an alternate location has been identified at Akkulam, in the neighbourhood of the tourist village and the Southern Air Command (SAC) headquarters.

The Revenue Department has issued orders granting permissive sanction to the Sainik Welfare Department for constructing the memorial on 1.5 acres of ‘sarkar puramboke’ land.

Post-Independence

Armed forces veterans have been demanding a memorial for soldiers who fought in the 1962 India-China war, the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, the 1999 Kargil war and operations over the past decades. The existing war memorial in the city, opposite the College of Fine Arts at Palayam, commemorates soldiers who fought in World War I.

The State government had issued the original order transferring 1.15 acres of land at Shanghumughom on June 28, 1999. “The land was encroached upon and converted into a playground by the local community. Due to violent objections from the local residents, this land could not be transferred to the Sainik Welfare Department,” the Revenue Department noted in a September 18 order. On June 20, 2018, the State government constituted a War Memorial Committee to thrash out a solution.

This six-member panel had studied the feasibility of identifying an alternative location for the structure. The land at Akkulam was finalised after a joint inspection by the director and joint secretary of the Sainik Welfare Department, officers of the defence forces, and the Deputy Collector (LR), Thiruvananthapuram.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/land-for-war-memorialidentified-at-akkulam/article32749758.ece
341,2020/10/02,Capital’s tally rises by 856,"District drops to fourth position, but CM cautions against crowding

Thiruvananthapuram’s COVID-19 case graph went up by 856 graph on Thursday, pushing the number of active cases in the district to 11,487.

The death toll jumped to 227 with nine more deaths in the district being attributed to the disease by the National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha. The deceased included natives of Pallithura (62-year-old), Pulluvila (52), Nedumangad (92), Muringavilakom (75), Neyyattinkara (61), Parassala (73), Chala (45), Attingal (61), and Kottoor (82).

While 708 people contracted the infection through local transmission, the source of infection of 109 other people was unknown. Twenty-nine health workers also were among those infected. There were five imported cases, among which four had come from other States while one person had come from abroad recently. A total of 363 people were discharged after recovering from the disease on Thursday.

Vulnerable segments

The pandemic continued to affect vulnerable sections in large numbers. While 130 people of those infected were aged above 60 years, 72 children aged below 15 years also tested positive.

Perhaps for the first time in several months, Thiruvananthapuram dropped to the fourth position among districts in daily caseload tally. However, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said during his customary briefing that the gravity of the situation remained unchanged in the capital district.

He said that while all efforts were taken to propagate awareness and contain the COVID-19 spread, large sections remained unwilling to adhere to the guidelines.

Crowded malls

“The district has begun to witness large crowds in shopping malls during the evenings and holidays. Many people have been bringing children to places that witness heavy rush. More worryingly, the same scenario prevailed near hospitals. There has also been instances of pregnant women visiting shops in the vicinity of hospitals. All such factors have been contributing to the mounting caseload in the district,” he said.

Mr. Vijayan also flagged the growing number of COVID-19 cases among those aged below 40 years. “Notably, people belonging to the same age group have been found to gather in large numbers. Considering a majority of deaths being reported in the State were of senior citizens aged above 60 years, the youth should exercise greater caution while returning to their houses from outside,” he said.

District Collector Navjot Khosa appealed to the public for restraint in areas that had an average of over 50 active COVID-19 cases, especially within the Corporation limits. These included places coming under Vattiyurkavu urban primary health centre (UPHC) (259 cases), Attukal UPHC (238), Vettucaud UPHC (236), Nemom zone (233), Kalippankulam UPHC (207) and Chala UPHC (204).",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/capitals-tally-rises-by-856/article32748128.ece

350,2020/10/02,Cancellation of gram sabha meetings invites criticism,"DMK conducts unofficial meetings in some villages in the central region

Cancellation of gram sabha meetings scheduled to be held on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanthi on Friday came in for widespread criticism from farmers’ organisations and opposition parties.

Members of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam conducted an unofficial gram sabha meetings in some of the villages in the central region and claimed to have adopted resolutions against the three Acts on agriculture reforms.

In Tiruchi, former Minister and DMK principal secretary K.N. Nehru participated in village meetings at Alundur and Mullikarumbur and highlighted the “adverse impact” that the three legislations would have on agriculture and farmers. The Acts would lead to corporatisation of agriculture. The State government had cancelled the meetings only to thwart attempts to adopt resolutions against the farm Acts, he said.

A section of DMK cadre and farmers staged protests at a couple of places in Tiruvarur district against the cancellation of the meetings and the three farm Acts.

Farmers explained

In Thanjavur, DMK office-bearers conducted meetings in some panchayats to explain the “adverse effects” that the farm Acts would have on agriculture. MLAs and elected representatives of local bodies participated in such meetings held in various villages in Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Pudukottai and other districts in the central region.

Meanwhile, P.R. Pandian, president, Tamil Nadu All Farmers Associations Coordination Committee, strongly condemned the State government’s decision to cancel the gram sabha meetings at the last minute when farmers had planned to move resolutions against the Centre’s three Acts on agriculture reforms.

Speaking to reporters at Irulnikki in Tiruvarur district, Mr. Pandian alleged that the State had resorted to the move at the instigation of the Union government, fearing the adoption of resolutions at the gram sabhas as the new legislations had been challenged in the Supreme Court. The move was nothing but an attempt to stifle voices of farmers.

The cancellation of meetings on Gandhi Jayanthi would only temporarily delay the adoption of resolutions against the farm Acts in the democratically-empowered gram sabhas, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/cancellation-of-gram-sabha-meetings-invites-disapproval/article32752790.ece
351,2020/10/02,Medical college completes two lakh COVID-19 tests,"Microbiology lab scales up processing capacity to 2,800 samples a day

The microbiology laboratory at Thanjavur Medical College Hospital on Thursday completed the processing of two lakh COVID 19 tests. The district administration, with the help of the doctors at the TMCH, has increased the number of samples lifted to 2,500 a day.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) granted approval to TMCH to conduct COVID-19 testing on April 13. While many other medical colleges already had Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) machines on hand, the TMCH had to set up a lab, equipped with the machines, and rapid RNA extractors. “The cost of setting up a fully-equipped lab was around ₹1 crore,” said Dean S. Maruthudurai. Until April 13, the samples were sent to Tiruvarur for processing.

Meanwhile, the TMCH has also increased its test processing capacity. “We had been processing 2,000 samples a day, but we have scaled up the capacity to 2,500 to 2,800,” Dr. Maruthudurai said.

The district administration is shifting its focus to testing pockets and clusters where patients have already tested positive and thereby keeping a check on transmission of the viral infection, he said. Positivity rate in the district was an average of 5.8 to 6%, while the death rate was 1.3%.

A team of 17 technicians, six house surgeons, seven assistant professors and one associate professor man the microbiology lab round-the-clock. “We aim to provide reports for the viral infection within 48 hours,” he said.

80% from Thanjavur

Of the two lakh samples processed, 80% are patients hailing from Thanjavur district, Dr. Maruthudurai said. “Initially we received samples from Ariyalur, Perambalur and Pudukottai, but the State government has scaled up the number of laboratories at medical college hospitals, and since July, we have been processing only samples lifted in Thanjavur,” he said.

The hospital has 1,060 beds, and preparation is under way to set up another 300. Dr. Maruthudurai said the aim was to reduce the positivity rate to 5%, death rate to 1% and absolute numbers to below 100 by October-end.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/i3vhoe/article32756629.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03TYDELTA-COLLEGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/medical-college-completes-two-lakh-covid-19-tests/article32752549.ece

355,2020/10/02,La Liga | Messi-Fati in the act again,"Former works his magic, latter scores

Barcelona’s new double-act delivered again as Lionel Messi and Ansu Fati led the team to a 3-0 victory at Celta Vigo in LaLiga on Thursday, despite Clement Lenglet’s sending off in the first half.

After scoring twice in Barca’s opening game of the season, Fati fired early at a blustery Balaidos, only for Lenglet to collect a second yellow card in the 42nd minute for pulling back Denis Suarez.

But even when down to 10, Ronald Koeman’s side was undeterred and Messi made the lead more comfortable shortly after half-time, his weaving run and shot diverted in for an own-goal by Lucas Olaza.

Celta hit the crossbar but never really threatened a comeback, and when the ball spilled loose after another Messi dash in injury-time, Sergi Roberto rifled it home and made it 3-0.

“We did a great job,” said Koeman. “I'm very proud of this team, we worked hard, played with a lot of discipline with a man less and even then we made the best chances. I'm very, very happy.”

Two out of two

Victory makes it two wins out of two for Barcelona, which began by thrashing Villarreal 4-0 on Sunday. Yet, this was arguably a more impressive performance, and not just because of the numerical disadvantage.

Fati dazzled again. The 17-year-old continued his brilliant start to the season with another smart finish and he offered the kind of pace and penetration that this team so often lacked last term.

Philippe Coutinho, meanwhile, looked back to the Coutinho of old. Deployed in a more central attacking position in Koeman’s 4-2-3-1 system, the Brazilian was aggressive without the ball and adventurous with it. He was unlucky not to score in the second half when his shot cannoned back off the post.

Perhaps most encouraging for Koeman was seeing the likes of Fati and Coutinho shine on a night when, in truth, Messi was not at his best, even if his display included two superb runs, both of which led to goals.

Celta, which only just escaped relegation last season, may not have offered the stiffest examination but it has an excellent record at home against Barca, which could easily have caved after Lenglet’s red card.

Lenglet will be suspended for the game against his former club Sevilla on Sunday.

Fati opened the scoring in the 11th minute after Coutinho played a quick pass following a poor clearance from Jeison Murillo. Allowing the ball to roll across his body, Fati manoeuvred it away from Joseph Aidoo and with the outside of his right foot, steered inside the corner.

Gerard Pique was lucky not to be sent off, spared because Suarez was offside, but Lenglet paid the price for planting a hand on Suarez's shoulder as he looked to pull away.

Messi helped to make it two after half-time, darting away from three Celta defenders before his shot took a cruel deflection off Olaza and crept inside the post.

He thought he had scored again after Coutinho's shot came back to him off the woodwork and in the 95th minute, it was the 33-year-old's run and shot that fell to the feet of Sergi, who smashed in for a third.

The results:

Athletic Bilbao 0 lost to Cadiz 1 (Lopez 57-og).

Sevilla 1 (En-Nesyri 90+2) bt Levante 0; Celta Vigo 0 lost to Barcelona 3 (Fati 11, Olaza 51-og, Roberto 90+5).",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/8sj4rg/article32754378.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03BARCELONA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/la-liga-messi-fati-in-the-act-again/article32754379.ece
356,2020/10/02,Barcelona overcomes early red card to earn big win at Celta,"The Catalans, who had failed to win their last five league games at Celta's Balaidos, maintained control even with 10 men.

Impressive performances from Lionel Messi and Ansu Fati helped Barcelona overcome an early red card to defender Clement Lenglet and win 3-0 at Celta Vigo on Thursday to make it two wins out of two in the new La Liga season.

Teenager Fati showed pace and anticipation to nip in between two Celta defenders and fire Barca ahead in the 11th minute, picking up where he left off with his two early goals in Sunday's 4-0 win over Villarreal.

Barca's lead looked to be under threat when Lenglet received a second booking at the end of the first half for striking former Barca player Denis Suarez in the face, sparking furious protests from Messi and Gerard Pique.

But Barca quickly doubled their advantage soon after the interval, as Messi tore through Celta's defence and fired a low shot which took a heavy deflection off Lucas Olaza and squirmed past keeper Ivan Villar for an own goal.

The Catalans, who had failed to win their last five league games at Celta's Balaidos, maintained control even with 10 men, only once looking in danger of conceding.

Nolito skipped into the area but his shot was saved by Barca stand-in keeper Neto, Celta's Miguel Baeza pounced on the rebound but Sergi Roberto threw his body in the way and deflected the goal-bound shot on to the crossbar.

Messi almost got a goal himself with another bursting run into the area but his shot was saved by Villar, leaving Sergi Roberto to lash high into the net deep in added time for the third goal.

Sergi Roberto praised Barca's fighting spirit and said they had learned to battle after their humiliating 8-2 thrashing by Bayern Munich in last season's Champions League.

“It was very important we continued to play with positivity when we had one player less,” he said.

“We defended as a team, everyone did their job and we played with a lot of desire, and showed we really want to achieve great things this season.

“We realised after the result against Bayern that we had to change things, we were fighting right up until the last minute today,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/dtnnwz/article32749419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THAPBARCA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/barcelona-overcomes-early-red-card-to-earn-big-win-at-celta/article32749420.ece
357,2020/10/02,League Cup | Arsenal edge past Liverpool on penalties,"With the Premier League champions making several changes to the team that beat Arsenal in the league 3-1 on Monday and their opponents also rotating, it was always unlikely to be a high-class encounter.

Arsenal squeezed past Liverpool 5-4 on penalties to advance to the League Cup quarter-finals on Thursday after a goalless 90 minutes.

With the Premier League champions making several changes to the team that beat Arsenal in the league 3-1 on Monday and their opponents also rotating, it was always unlikely to be a high-class encounter.

Liverpool had the better chances and should have been awarded a 44th-minute penalty when Diogo Jota was brought down in the box.

The resulting free kick eventually led to Takumi Minimino finding space and smashing his close-range shot onto the crossbar.

Arsenal keeper Bernd Leno made two consecutive saves to stop Jota and Marko Grujic and the visitors responded with a chance of their own as Rob Holding's header was punched away by Adrian in the 70th minute. The Gunners also appealed for a penalty in stoppage time when James Milner fell and handled the ball.

The referee Kevin Friend did not point to the spot and there is no VAR in the competition.

Arsenal, however, celebrated in shootout when Joe Willock's spot kick crept under keeper Adrian to send them through.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/9al4rt/article32748637.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THAPARSENALLIVERPOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/league-cup-arsenal-edge-past-liverpool-on-penalties/article32748638.ece
358,2020/10/02,Two players test positive as football is set to resume,"I-League Qualifiers, the first competitive sports event in India, begins on Oct. 8

Two players tested positive of COVID-19 as the city geared up to host the first competitive sports event in the country — the I-League Qualifiers — following the easing of lockdown.

A statement from the All India Football Federation (AIFF) said that a player each from FC Bengaluru United and Bhawanipore FC have tested positive.

“All appropriate medical support is being given to the teams, and the players who tested positive are under medical supervision in a quarantined environment as required by the safety measures and COVID-19 protocols put in place for the tournament,” read the AIFF statement, which did not name the players.

More than 150 players, support staff and officials are put up at a five-star hotel near Salt Lake stadium which is one of the two venues for the tournament starting on October 8. The other venue is Kalyani which is on the outskirts.

This is the first official tournament to happen ever since the government allowed sports activities (under unlock 4.0) from Sept. 21. A total of five teams — Mohammedan Sporting, Bhawanipore FC (both Kolkata outfits), ARA FC (Ahmedabad), FC Bengaluru United and Garhwal FC (Delhi) — will be competing for the lone berth reserved for the tournament proper (I-League).

The AIFF has created a bio-bubble, a new mandate in the world of sports since the pandemic began early this year, and the participants have safely made it to the secured atmosphere in the hotel which has been closed to all ‘outsiders’.

Three out of the five teams started practising on Thursday to get in shape for the 12-day tournament which will see 10 matches played in a round-robin format. The Kalyani stadium will be hosting six matches and the Salt Lake stadium four.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/two-players-test-positive-as-football-is-set-to-resume/article32747939.ece
359,2020/10/02,"Human-leopard conflict has increased threefold in Karnataka, finds study","Policy guidelines on conflict mitigation has made little impact

A study conducted across Karnataka indicates that the policy guidelines brought out by Government of India to mitigate human-leopard conflict and discourage translocation of the animal has had little impact on the ground.

The number of leopards captured per month increased more than threefold (from 1.5 to 4.6) after the human-leopard policy guidelines were brought out in 2011. Similarly, there was a threefold increase in the number of leopards translocated per month (from 1 to 3.5).

Sanjay Gubbi of the Nature Conservation Foundation, who led the study in the State, said the guidelines for human-leopard conflict management were brought out in April 2011 to reduce conflict with leopards, discourage their translocation, and suggest improved ways of handling emergency conflict situations.

Mr. Gubbi, the lead author of the paper, said that in Karnataka, 357 leopards were in conflict situations and were captured between 2009 and 2016, and the final outcome was available in the case of 314 leopards. Of these, 268 were translocated in contravention of the spirit of the policy, 34 were captured and kept in captivity, while 12 died during the capture.

These findings have been published in a paper titled ‘Policy to on-ground action: Evaluating a conflict policy guideline for leopards in India’ in the Journal of International Wildlife Law and Policy. The co-authors of the paper are Aparna Kolekar and Vijaya Kumara.

Taking Karnataka as a case study, the researchers analysed pre- and post-guidelines leopard captures, reasons for the captures, and the outcome for the captured leopards.

The numbers

The study found that out of 357 leopards captured across 23 of the 30 districts in the State during 2009-16, a majority (79%) occurred in Mysuru, Udupi, Hassan, Tumakuru, Ramanagaram, Ballari, Koppal, and Mandya districts.

Of the 268 leopards translocated, many were moved to protected areas (59.7%) and some to reserved/State/minor forests (29.8%). The highest number of translocations occurred into Bandipur Tiger Reserve (22.5%), followed by Nagarahole Tiger Reserve (20.6%) and Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary (15%).

The study indicated that of the 80 leopards that were translocated to reserved/State/minor forests, most releases were to Kemphole Reserved Forest (16.2%), followed by Devarayanadurga State Forest (7.5%) and Bukkapatna State Forest (5%).

Though eight reasons were attributed to capture and translocation of leopards, the main justification was livestock depredation (38.1%), said Mr. Gubbi. The other reasons included leopards rescued from snares and wells (15.7%), anxiety caused owing to leopard sightings in human habitations (13.7%), and leopards entering human dwellings (10.9%). Human injuries (4.5%) and human deaths (2%) formed a small part of the reason for leopard captures and translocation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/vcfh1r/article32754944.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGLEOPARD,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/human-leopard-conflict-has-increased-threefold-in-karnataka-finds-study/article32754945.ece
360,2020/10/02,Honda to withdraw from Formula One at end of 2021 season,"Honda has decided to strive for the ‘realization of carbon neutrality by 2050’

Honda will withdraw from Formula One at the end of the 2021 season, the Japanese engine manufacturer announced Friday, citing environmental initiatives.

Honda, which resumed competition in F1 in 2015, is the power unit supplier to Red Bull and AlphaTauri.

The company said it had attained its goals of earning victories last season and two wins in 2020.

In the meantime, as the automobile industry undergoes a once-in-one-hundred-years period of great transformation, Honda has decided to strive for the ‘realization of carbon neutrality by 2050,’ Honda said in a statement.

This goal will be pursued as part of Honda’s environmental initiatives which is one of the top priorities of Honda as a mobility manufacturer.

Toward this end, Honda needs to funnel its corporate resources in research and development into the areas of future power unit and energy technologies, including fuel cell vehicle (FCV) and battery EV (BEV) technologies, which will be the core of carbon-free technologies, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/motorsport/4qtci1/article32751747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HONDAKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/motorsport/honda-to-withdraw-from-formula-one-at-end-of-2021-season/article32751748.ece
361,2020/10/02,Potty training: NASA tests new $23 million titanium space toilet,"The last time NASA ordered up a new toilet was in the early 1990s to accommodate two-week space shuttle missions.

NASA’s first new space potty in decades — a $23 million titanium toilet better suited for women — is getting a not-so-dry run at the International Space Station before eventually flying to the moon.

It’s packed inside a cargo ship that should have blasted off late on Thursday from Wallops Island, Virginia. But the launch was aborted with just two minutes remaining in the countdown. Northrop Grumman said it would try again Friday night if engineers can figure out what went wrong.

Barely 45 kilograms and just 71 centimeters tall, the new toilet is roughly half as big as the two Russian-built ones at the space station.

It’s more camper-size to fit into the NASA Orion capsules that will carry astronauts to the moon in a few years.

Station residents will test it out for a few months. If the shakedown goes well, the toilet will be open for regular business.

Many changes

With SpaceX now launching astronauts to the space station and Boeing less than a year from sending up its first crew, more toilets are needed. The new one will be in its own stall alongside the old one on the U.S. side of the outpost.

The old toilets cater more toward men. To better accommodate women, NASA tilted the seat on the new toilet and made it taller. The new shape should help astronauts position themselves better for No. 2, said Johnson Space Center’s Melissa McKinley, the project manager.

Cleaning up a mess is a big deal. We don’t want any misses or escapes, she said.

Let’s just say everything floats in weightlessness.

As for No. 1, the funnels also have been redesigned. Women can use the elongated and scooped-out funnels to urinate while sitting on the commode to poop at the same time, Ms. McKinley said. Until now, it’s been one or the other for female astronauts, she noted.

Like earlier space commodes, air suction, rather than water and gravity, removes the waste. Urine collected by the new toilet will be routed into NASA’s long-standing recycling system to produce water for drinking and cooking. Titanium and other tough alloys were chosen for the new toilet to withstand all the acid in the urine pretreatment.

Going to the bathroom in space may sound simple, but sometimes the simple things become very difficult without gravity, said NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins, commander of the second SpaceX crew, due to launch October 31 from Kennedy Space Center.

While the old design isn’t that hard to use, subtle design changes can make all the difference for women, noted NASA astronaut Shannon Walker, a former space station resident who’s also on the next SpaceX crew.

Trust me, I’ve got going to the bathroom in space down, because that is a vital, vital thing to know how to do, she told The Associated Press earlier this week.

Last shake-up in 1990s

The typical space station population will go from six to seven with the next SpaceX flight, and even more when non-professionals like tourists start showing up as early as next year. Astronauts normally stay six months.

The last time NASA ordered up a new toilet was in the early 1990s to accommodate two-week space shuttle missions. The agency contracted with Collins Aerospace to provide the latest model; the company also worked on the shuttle potties.

Also in the 3,600-kilogram shipment aboard Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus capsule: air tanks to make up for a slight space station leak, radish seeds for greenhouse growing and a cinematic 360-degree VR camera for you-are-there-spacewalk shots.

Perhaps the most unique payload: Estee Lauder’s newest wrinkle serum. The cosmetics company is paying $128,000 for an out-of-this-world photo shoot, part of NASA’s push to open the final frontier to marketing, industry and tourism.

Don’t count on perfumed aromas, though, to counter bathroom odors.

The serum is fragrance-free and the 10 bottles will remain sealed until returned to Earth early next year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/wcxn7q/article32749907.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SPACEPOTTYTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/potty-training-nasa-tests-new-23-million-titanium-space-toilet/article32749859.ece
