0,2020/10/08,National camp for core group to start from October 15,"Will be open for 32 shooters, including the 15 who have won Olympics quota places

The Sports Authority of India (SAI), in consultation with the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), has announced a training camp for core shooters from October 15 to Dec. 14.

The coaches had sought a four to six weeks camp to monitor the schedule of the shooters, who have all been training at home during the lockdown.

The camp, to he held at the Dr. Karni Singh Range in Tughlakabad, will be open for 32 shooters, including all the 15 who have won the Tokyo Olympics quota places.

It is understood that all the shooters, eight Indian and two foreign coaches, and two support staff would stay in a hotel during the camp to ensure all the safety protocols. SAI has estimated the two-month camp would cost about ₹1.43 crore.

Anjum Moudgil, who won the first Olympic quota for the Tokyo Games with a silver in the World Championship, and Divyansh Singh Panwar, the World No. 1 in men’s air rifle, expressed happiness about the camp and preparing together in a team atmosphere.

“Regular shooting in a camp environment will give us a better idea of where we currently stand”, said Anjum.

Raninder elated

NRAI president Raninder Singh was elated with SAI sanctioning the camp.

“Our shooters have been training at home during the lockdown. But, to train together at a camp is going to help them much more.

“We are very happy that SAI has sanctioned this two-month training camp,” said Raninder.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/44d29n/article32806679.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09ANJUM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/national-camp-for-core-group-to-start-from-october-15/article32806680.ece
1,2020/10/08,Meet boxing coach Mujtaba Kamal who wants to put India on the pro boxing map,"After an injury ended his dreams of becoming a professional boxer, Mujtaba Kamal’s helping young talents succeed

""I don't count the sit-ups. I only start counting when it starts hurting because they're the only ones that count. That's what makes you a champion.""

This famous Muhammad Ali quote paints pain as a virtue. It’s true perhaps for boxers. In a sport of throwing punches, you probably sign up to be friends with pain. While pain might have the power to transform a person, it doesn’t necessarily get them what they wish for. Mujtaba Kamal knows this well.

Mujtaba, 36, is a celebrity boxing coach based in Bengaluru. He’s taught Shahid Kapoor, Sonakshi Sinha among others. He’s a coach at the fitness chain Cult.fit. Boxing is his profession and passion. Of the latter, he says, “My main goal is to groom young talent, who can make a mark in the world of professional boxing.”

Chennai’s Karthik Sathish Kumar, 24, whom Mujtaba mentored, won the gold medal in the youth world boxing championships. Kumar, ranked 99 in the lightweight category in Asia, has won his first five professional bouts. Nineteen-year-old Faizan Anwar (Asia rank 53 welterweight), meanwhile, is in the UAE to compete with higher-ranked opponents.

Mujtaba uses social media and his network of boxers to scout for young talent. He knows some of the big names of Indian boxing like Vijender Singh and Akhil Kumar. “I send some 100 or 200 pairs of boxing gloves to the people I know. I ask them to give it to young boxing talents they know and send me videos of them boxing. If they are talented, I start mentoring them.” Sanjay Thapa, 22, moved from Nepal to India to train under Mujtaba. Thapa is now 6-0 in his pro boxing career.

Mujtaba, who’s from Kolkata, used to be a young talent too. He’d won 11 national boxing medals. Sometime in the mid-2000s, he decided to be a professional boxer. India hardly has a platform for pro boxing. The situation was worse a decade ago. So, he went to Hong Kong in 2007 to build his career. Mujtaba hardly knew anyone there. After five years of perseverance, he got a professional bout. It broke his jaw and spirit and changed his life.

“I was left with nothing after that bout. I was alone on a flight back to Kolkata. After returning, I couldn't eat anything for a month. I lost 10 kilos.”

Mujtaba’s struggles did not yield success. Lack of guidance, he felt, was the main reason for that. So, he decided to be a fitness boxing coach, which would give him the means to find and groom young talent.

Professional boxing is still nascent in India. Vijender Singh, apart, there are no well-known names here. “The problem is people look down on pro boxing. But you look at all the all-time great boxers -- they all turned pro at a very young age. The battles are intense in pro boxing. It prepares you well for the Olympics. I am pretty sure that one of my trainees will be at the 2024 Olympics.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/hk6pqh/article32804662.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MujtabaKamal2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/meet-boxing-trainer-mujtaba-kamal-who-wants-to-put-india-in-the-pro-boxing-map/article32804663.ece

Only paid YouTube users will be able to test the video-streaming platform’s experimental features, report says. The Google-owned company earlier allowed its beta features to be used by a select group of both regular and premium users.

The company tested features like Explore tab, the new mobile comment section, and video chapters with these chosen people before rolling out to the rest of the users.

But now, users can join these experiments only with a premium account. YouTube will prompt them to sign in with a Premium account, Android Central reported.

""For a limited time, Premium members can try out new features that we're working on. Share your feedback to help us build a better YouTube,"" according to YouTube's experimental page.

YouTube Premium is a monthly subscription that streams ad-free videos. It also enables users to download videos, background play, and YouTube Music Premium.

Google has not clarified why YouTube is choosing to limit these experiments to its Premium members.

According to Android Police, YouTube has taken this route because it might have identified Premium subscribers as its most engaged users, and the ones most likely to give feedback.

It is also possible that placing more features in YouTube Premium might attract more users to sign up to the paid service.

According to the findings of a survey run by Oracle, 75% employees believed artificial intelligence (AI) has helped improve their mental health, either directly or indirectly.

The technology company surveyed over 12,000 participants, comprising managers, staff, HR professionals and C-suite leaders, across 11 countries, including the U.S., India, France, Italy and Germany.

The respondents were asked about mental health attitudes, AI, digital assistants, chatbots and robots at workplace.

More than 80% respondents said the pandemic negatively affected their mental health, making 2020 the most stressful year ever.

They said, AI has helped improve wellbeing by providing necessary information on the job, automating tasks and reducing stress. It has also helped prioritise tasks and reduce workload to prevent burnout.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Last week, NASA said it spotted previously unknown craters on Mars with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) for the first time.

The space agency developed an AI tool to analyse images captured by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), which led to the discovery.

Scientists identified craters made by pieces of a meteor on the red planet. The largest of the craters is about 13-feet (4 meters) wide, and in total, the craters span about 100 feet (30 meters) of the planet's surface, NASA said in a statement.

MRO has been orbiting the planet for 14 years, and its data has been used to locate more than 1,000 new craters.

Scientists used a two-step process to confirm the craters on the red planet.

First, they deployed AI to take a look at orbiter's Context Camera's low-resolution images and analyse if they captured any craters. Then, using HiRISE instrument, they verified the images picked by the AI.

NASA says, the instrument is capable of showing details as fine as the tracks left by the Curiosity Mars rover. However, it takes about 40 minutes for a researcher to thoroughly examine a single Context Camera image, while the AI tool takes an average of five seconds to do it.

On August 26, HiRISE confirmed that a dark smudge detected by the classifier in a region called Noctis Fossae was in fact the cluster of craters, the space agency noted.

The AI tool was trained using a small set of images from the Context Camera, including locations, with previously discovered impacts, and with no fresh impacts. Later, it was used to scan the camera's entire repository of over one lakh images.

“AI can't do the kind of skilled analysis a scientist can,” Kiri Wagstaff, JPL computer scientist, said. “But tools like this new algorithm can be their assistants. This paves the way for an exciting symbiosis of human and AI ‘investigators’ working together to accelerate scientific discovery.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/l7gwsg/article32802950.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NASA-Mars-craters,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/ai-assists-nasa-to-spot-craters-on-mars/article32803191.ece
5,2020/10/08,"Musk says Tesla to use new batteries, tech in Model Y; flags production risk","The company plans to start the production of Model Y at Gigafactory Berlin during the second half of 2021.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday the company will produce Model Y with a new structural battery design and technology at its Berlin factory next year and that could result in a “significant production risk”.

The U.S. electric carmaker plans to manufacture a new version of its Model Y crossover vehicle, and possibly even battery cells at the site. Last month, Musk said that Tesla will use its Germany-based plant to demonstrate a radical overhaul of how its cars are built.

The company plans to start the production of Model Y at Gigafactory Berlin during the second half of 2021.

Tesla's new battery cell - a larger cylindrical format called 4680 that can store more energy and is easier to make - is key to achieving the goal of cutting battery costs in half and ramping up battery production nearly 100-fold by 2030.

The company's new structural battery pack requires the new 4680 battery cells in order to work.

Musk said on Wednesday that it will take about two years for Tesla factories in Fremont and Shanghai to embrace the new technology.

“Fremont and Shanghai will transition in 2 years when new tech is proven,” Musk said in a tweet.

The company said last week that it delivered 139,300 vehicles in the third quarter, a quarterly record for the electric carmaker.

7,2020/10/08,Instagram turns 10: How a photo-sharing app redefined the way we socialise,"From starting out as a platform to just share images, Instagram has evolved over the years, and has added several features to engage its users.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

A decade ago, two Americans, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, founded a social networking platform dedicated to sharing photos. Today, Instagram has transformed the way millions of people express themselves globally.

From starting out as a platform to just share images, Instagram has evolved over the years, and has added several features to engage its users.

Timeline

Within two months of its launch in October 2010, Instagram clocked one million users. Its growing popularity caught Facebook’s attention, making the social network buy the platform in 2012.

The Facebook-owned company hit 500 million users mark four years later. The same year, it launched the widely-popular stories feature globally.

In 2018, Instagram introduced long-form videos with IGTV, integrated music into its stories, and garnered a billion active users.

To take advantage of the growing trend in short-form video making apps, the platform introduced Reels in August this year, just after India banned TikTok app.

“We’re witnessing enormous shifts in how people create and consume culture as tools that were only available to the most sophisticated media organizations are now literally in the hands of billions,” Instagram said.

“We’ve seen an explosion of video, which is why we’ve been focusing on IGTV and Reels.”

Changing way of life

A decade ago, it was inconceivable that hashtags would become a trend. Now, people frequently post pictures of breakfast, evening sun and window views with ahashtag.

According to a report titled ‘Average Time Spent Daily on Social Media’ by data intelligence firm Broadband Search, social media takes 144 minutes of our daily life, of which 53 minutes are spent on Instagram.

Instagram has been attempting to diversify its platform from just being a photo-sharing so users can spend more time on it.

Last year, it introduced a shopping feature that lets its users buy and sell products within the app. Brands are looking to adapt their marketing practices to benefit from this feature to lure customers.

Building blocks maker Lego has been posting pop culture related content on the platform. Sephora collections populates its feed with colourful Instagram video content that portrays the brand’s playful and feminine personality.

Influencers are another big part of the platform -- popular celebrities promote brands. Fashion influencers also get paid partnerships with clothing and cosmetic brands. Cricketers post endorsement for sporting brands. Virat Kohli endorses Puma, and Rohit Sharma posts photos and videos for Adidas.

Instagram has served as a platform for photographers, videographers and other creatively-inclined people to showcase their talent and skill.

Double-edged sword

Instagram has also been criticised for creating unrealistic beauty standards by offering filters that adjust brightness, colour and contrast to make a ‘perfect’ photo.

Recently, Facebook was sued for allegedly spying on Instagram users via their cameras. Another lawsuit claimed Instagram was collecting biometric data of users through photo-tagging features.

Over the years, the photo-sharing app has faced scrutiny multiple times over its handling of harassment issues and changes in privacy policy.

Instagram faced a major setback in September 2018, when its founders resigned after a tussle with Facebook’s management over the photo-sharing platform’s autonomy.

It was widely speculated that Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg disagreed with Instagram founders on the app's future.

Zuckerberg stopped encouraging Facebook users to post on Instagram to maintain the social network’s autonomy, according to a report by Wired.

Tenth anniversary features

To celebrate its tenth year milestone, Instagram has added features like stories map and ways to hide potentially offensive comments.

Stories map is a private map and calendar of stories a user has shared in the last three years. They will be able to share, download, and save those stories in highlights.

Instagram also announced a pair of new anti-bullying features. The company has started testing a new feature that will automatically hide comments similar to others that have been reported. To give more transparency into the type of comments that are hidden, users can tap “View Hidden Comments” to see them.

In addition to this, it is adding comment warnings for people who repeatedly attempt to post comments that might be offensive.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/firlsz/article32801484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/insta-10th-birthdayjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/instagram-turns-10-how-a-photo-sharing-app-redefined-the-way-we-socialise/article32801460.ece
8,2020/10/08,Facebook sued two companies for data scraping. What does this mean?,"Data scraping isn’t declared illegal, but the intention of the practice can be examined. Misuse of the method include collecting data for bulk mailing, robo calling and malicious social engineering.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Last week, Facebook sued two companies in the U.S. for scraping data from its platforms in connection with an international data harvesting work.

The social media firm said actions of BrandTotal Ltd., an Israeli-based company, and Unimania Inc., based in the U.S. state of Delaware, violated Facebook's terms of service.

These companies are said to have scraped data from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn and Amazon to sell ""marketing intelligence"" and other services.

On October 14, Facebook said it filed a new complaint in federal court in California against the two companies for publishing a new malicious extension on Google's Chrome Web Store designed to scrape Facebook, in violation of its Terms and Policies.

What is data scraping?

Data scraping, or web scraping, is the process of extracting data from a website. Scraper bots are designed to derive information from these websites. A user designing a bot to extract data is called a scraper.

Teams or individuals resort to data scraping from various companies to source marketing information related content and product price.

They deploy bots that pull content from websites to replicate the uniqueness of a product or service. Pricing data can used to understand a product’s competition.

At other times, contact details of customers or clients are scraped to get a hold on confidential information. By accessing online employee directories, a scraper can collate details for bulk mailing, robo-calling and malicious social engineering.

Data scrapers use Chrome plug-ins and extensions to extract data directly from the web page. Data mining tools like 'Import.io' provides built-in web browser to find data and create mining specifications to extract relevant information.

Is data scraping illegal?

Although data scraping is not declared illegal, the purpose of scraping can be examined. Good bots enable search engines to index web content, compare prices of different services, and gauge sentiment on social media for market research.

Bad bots fetch content with an intention to reveal sensitive information. They engage in denial-of-service attacks, competitive data mining, online fraud, account hijacking, data and intellectual property theft, unauthorised vulnerability scans, spam, and digital ad fraud. These bots make up for 20% of all web traffic, according to cybersecurity research firm Imperva.

In the case of Facebook, the two companies exploited users' access to services through a set of browser extensions called 'Upvoice' and 'Ads Feeds', designed to access data.

When users installed the extensions and visited Facebook's websites, the browser extensions used automated programmes to scrape their name, user ID, gender, date of birth, relationship status, location information, and other information related to their accounts. The extensions sent the scraped data to a server shared by the two companies.

Ultimately, the companies engaged in data harvesting with malicious intent.

Facebook's previous actions

​This is not Facebook’s first legal action against scrapers. In March 2019, the company sued two Ukranian developers who scraped profile information and people’s friends lists on Facebook using quiz apps and browser extensions. A California Court recommended a judgement in favour of Facebook.

Two months ago, in August, the social network sued Mobiburn app in the U.K. for collecting user data from Facebook and other social media companies by paying app developers to install a malicious SDK in their apps.

The way out

The simplest way to prevent a website from being scraped is to block multiple requests from the same IP address. Other methods like requesting login credentials for access, using CAPTCHAs, and changing the website's HTML settings regularly can also be effective.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/150ier/article32800815.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FBjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-sued-two-companies-for-data-scraping-what-does-this-mean/article32800752.ece

10,2020/10/08,U.S. election 2020 | Pandemic dominate Harris-Biden debate,"Against the backdrop of a raging pandemic that has claimed more than 210,000 lives across the country, Vice-President Mike Pence and Democratic vice-presidential pick Kamala Harris faced off in the only VP debate of the season in Salt Lake City, Utah. With acrylic sheet barriers beside their desks — a reminder of the public health crisis the nation faces — the candidates sparred on the Trump administration’s pandemic response, the economy, climate, China and Ms. Harris’s prosecutorial record.

Ms. Harris described the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic as “the greatest failure” of any administration in U.S. history and said — citing investigative journalist Bob Woodward — that the President knew about the viral threat at the end of January (weeks before a public emergency was declared). She said the administration still did not have a plan to tackle the pandemic.

“And frankly, this administration has forfeited their right to re-election based on this,” Ms. Harris said.

The debate was noticeably civil and involved some substantive policy discussions unlike the presidential debate last week between President Donald Trump and his challenger, Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Also noticeable — and discussed on social media and in the press — was a fly that landed Mr. Pence’s head during the debate.

Mr. Pence said Mr. Biden, if elected President, was going to raise taxes and that he was going to ban fracking, prompting Ms. Harris to declare — twice — that Mr. Biden would not raise taxes for those making less than $400,000 a year and would not ban fracking. Mr. Pence said Mr. Biden was a “cheerleader for Communist China”. Ms. Harris said the Trump administration had lost its trade war with China and that had an impact on the U.S. economy and jobs.

Dodging questions

Candidates avoided answering questions — Ms. Harris repeatedly did not answer a question on whether or not her party would “pack the court” (increase the number of Supreme Court justices from nine) if Republicans confirmed judge Amy Coney Barret to the court. There were instances of Mr. Pence providing information on one subject when he was asked about another.

The Vice President refused to answer whether climate change was an existential crisis.

“The climate is changing, we’ll follow the science,” he said. The Trump administration has often questioned the role of science as a basis of policy making. In September, at a meeting with state officials in California to discuss the wildfires ravaging the West Coast, Mr. Trump had said, “I don’t think the science knows.”

Ms. Harris defended a hypothetical Biden-Harris administration’s decision to join the Paris climate accord and said they would do so “with pride”.

Mr. Pence also did not elaborate on how the pre-existing health conditions would be covered in any alternative plan to the Obama-era Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which the Trump administration is litigating in the Supreme Court.

“If you have a pre-existing condition..., heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they’re coming for you,” Ms. Harris had said during the debate. “If you love someone who has a pre-existing condition, they’re coming for you. If you’re under the age of 26 on your parents’ coverage, they’re coming for you,” she said.

Transfer of power

When asked a question on what he would do if Mr. Trump refused to accept the election results, Mr. Pence did not provide a straight answer, instead saying that the Republicans were going to win the election.

“When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election,” Mr. Pence said, referring, among other things, to the impeachment of Mr. Trump by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.

Responding to a similar question on the Biden-Harris strategy if Mr. Trump refused to accept the results, Ms. Harris said: “Please vote. Vote early, come up with a plan to vote.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tcotp7/article32806656.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-TOPSHOT-US-VOTE-DEBATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pandemic-dominate-harris-biden-debate/article32806659.ece
11,2020/10/08,Tamil MPs question Rajapaksa govt’s commitment to Indo-Lanka Accord,"All Ceylon Tamil Congress rejects 13th Amendment

A fortnight after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a virtual summit with his Sri Lankan counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa, urged the country to address Tamil aspirations with the implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, Tamil MPs questioned the government’s commitment to the preceding Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987.

Jaffna legislator and All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) general secretary G.G. Ponnambalam told Parliament his party rejected the contentious legislation on the basis that it “does not even form a starting point” to finding a solution to the Tamil national question. The ACTC has two legislators in the 225-member House. However, observing that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and PM Mahinda Rajapaksa might think that because [some] Tamil people reject the 13th Amendment, they have an opportunity to “throw away” the preceding Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987, he said: “That will never happen.”

Mr. Ponnambalam pointed to a “massive gap” between the Accord and the 13th Amendment that he called a “unilateral interpretation” of the bilateral agreement by the then J.R. Jayawardene government. “Therefore, whilst we reject the 13th Amendment... the Accord is something we will not reject. On the contrary, we will hold India to account that it upholds the provisions of the Accord in order to recognise the Tamil nationhood and find a viable political solution that is acceptable to the Tamil people,” the Jaffna MP said, speaking during an adjournment motion on international agreements.

Reiterating his point on the Accord, M.A. Sumanthiran, fellow Jaffna MP from the Tamil National Alliance that has 10 legislators in the House, said it was an international bilateral agreement signed between two sovereign nations.

“It has to be honoured. There is no question that one or the other can get away from the obligations under that Accord,” he said, responding to Minister of State Sarath Weeraksekara’s remarks opposing it. “I wish to ask the government what is your stand?” Mr. Sumanthiran said, referring to Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa’s past assurances — including to India — that he would “fully implement” the 13th Amendment and “go beyond” that to make devolution meaningful.

Differing slightly from Mr. Ponnambalam’s position on the 13th Amendment, Mr. Sumanthiran said it “may have been a starting point” for it established provincial councils, where in the unit of devolution was a province. “But President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his tenure of office has admitted that it is not a meaningful measure of devolution,” he told the House.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indo-lanka-accord-cant-be-thrown-away-tamil-mp/article32806453.ece
12,2020/10/08,Court to rule on Golden Dawn top brass,"A Greek court on Thursday will deliver eagerly-awaited sentences after leaders of neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn were found guilty of running a criminal outfit in a landmark case, a court source said.

The court is also expected to announce whether judges would accept any mitigating terms in passing sentences, said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.

After over five years of hearings, the panel of three judges on Wednesday unanimously labelled the paramilitary party a criminal organisation in what was seen as the most important political trial in decades.

The verdict translates into possible prison sentences of up to 15 years for the top members of the party, including its founder Nikos Michaloliakos.

Unless the court on Thursday agrees to suspend sentencing pending appeals, police are standing by to take those convicted to prison, a source said.

13,2020/10/08,Trump for early pullout of troops in Afghanistan,"‘We should have the small remaining number... serving in Afghanistan home by Christmas,’ he tweeted

All U.S. troops in Afghanistan should be “home by Christmas,” President Donald Trump said on Wednesday, just hours after his national security adviser said Washington would reduce its forces in Afghanistan to 2,500 by early next year.

A landmark deal between the United States and the Taliban in February said foreign forces would leave Afghanistan by May 2021 in exchange for counterterrorism guarantees from the Taliban, which agreed to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and a power-sharing formula with the Afghan government.

Trump and other officials have said the United States will go down to between 4,000 and 5,000 troops in Afghanistan around November.

Beyond that, officials have said that a reduction will depend on conditions in Afghanistan.

On Twitter, Mr. Trump said: “We should have the small remaining number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in Afghanistan home by Christmas!”

It was unclear whether Mr. Trump was giving an order or verbalising a long-held aspiration.

Mr. Trump, who is seeking re-election next month, has made walking away from “ridiculous endless wars” the cornerstone of his foreign policy, even though thousands of troops remain in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.

The Taliban, fighting to expel foreign forces and re-establish their Islamic state since their ouster in 2001, welcomed Trump’s comments.

The U.S. President’s statement was “a positive step towards the implementation of the Doha agreement”, Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem said in a statement, referring to the February pact signed in the Qatari capital.

The U.S.-backed Afghan government did not immediately respond to requests for comment but officials have warned against a hasty withdrawal of foreign forces.

Mr. Trump’s comments could further weaken the Afghan government’s leverage during negotiations with the Taliban on a ceasefire and power-sharing taking place in Qatar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-for-early-pullout-of-troops-in-afghanistan/article32806318.ece
14,2020/10/08,High-powered Chinese delegation visits Sri Lanka,"Officials, led by Yang Jiechi, will meet Sri Lanka’s President and PM on Friday

In what is said to be the first outbound visit by top Chinese officials to South Asia since the outbreak of COVID-19, a senior Chinese delegation will meet Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in Colombo on Friday.

A “high-powered Chinese delegation”, led by senior Chinese leader and top foreign policy official Yang Jiechi, who is a member of the Communist Party of China’s Politburo and the director of the Central Committee’s Foreign Affairs Commission, the top policy-making body, will arrive in Colombo on Thursday night, the Foreign Ministry in Colombo said in a statement.

“Being the first ever Chinese visit in the South Asian region since the global coronavirus epidemic, the visit is expected to strengthen cooperation between Sri Lanka and China, in the areas of combating the global pandemic and revival of economic relations,” the statement said.

Four-nation tour

Sri Lanka will be Mr. Yang’s first stop on a four-nation tour, which will also see him visit the UAE, Algeria and Serbia, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said, adding he was invited by the governments of the four countries.

The visit takes place against the backdrop of worsening India-China relations and rising U.S.-China tensions, and a push by Beijing following the pandemic to deepen its economic ties in the neighbourhood, including through cooperation to battle the impact of COVID-19, a move that is being closely followed in both New Delhi and Washington.

The Chinese delegation’s meeting with Sri Lanka’s two most powerful leaders comes a fortnight after the virtual summit between Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Mahinda Rajapaksa. It also comes days after the ‘Quad’ meeting in Tokyo, where U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to “regional tensions” between India and China.

Debt freeze

New Delhi, in the bilateral summit, promised Colombo a $15-million grant for the promotion of Buddhist cultural exchanges. However, there was no final word on Colombo’s request for a debt freeze and an additional $1.1-billion currency swap facility — RBI signed one for $400 million in July — that President Gotabaya and PM Mahinda have sought from New Delhi. In March this year, Sri Lanka and China signed a “facility agreement” for a $500 million loan, on Colombo’s request. In Friday’s meetings, the two sides will likely discuss strengthening economic cooperation, specifically looking at ongoing Chinese-backed projects such as the $1.4 billion port city coming up on over 650 acres of reclaimed land by the seafront in Colombo.

Mr. Yang arrives in the midst of an unusual China-U.S. spat playing out in Sri Lanka. In a statement on October 5, the Chinese Embassy in Colombo slammed the U.S. for “naked hegemony, supremacy and power politics” after the American Ambassador in Colombo, Alaina Teplitz, in an interview with local media, criticised Chinese projects in Sri Lanka.

“The U.S. believes that partnerships between countries should be open, transparent, and mutually beneficial — and if this is what Sri Lanka’s relationship with China embodies, then we encourage it,” she said, adding that “a 2019 World Bank study concluded that more than 60% of China-funded Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects are allocated to Chinese companies and stressed that tender processes are opaque.”

The Chinese Embassy responded strongly, saying the interview “severely violated the diplomatic protocol”. “While it’s always not surprising to see the U.S. interfered into a sovereign country’s internal affairs, the general public is still astonished to witness its despicable attempt to manipulate others’ diplomatic relations,” the statement said, adding it “strongly suggest[s] the U.S. quit the addiction of preaching others and applying double standards”.

Chinese analysts have welcomed the return of the Rajapaksas to the helm, with PM Rajapaksa’s stint at President marking a rapid deepening in strategic and economic ties. Last month, both countries marked the six-year anniversary of the Colombo Port City project, which had been launched by Mr. Rajapaksa and President Xi Jinping in September 2014 as a flagship project in China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

Marking the anniversary, China’s official Xinhua news agency said last month the project “has powered through a turbulent six-year period, overcoming numerous challenges, including the Easter bombings in April 2019 hitting three luxury hotels near the project and affecting the country’s tourism, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the country less than a year later.”

Economic impact

While Sri Lanka’s early public health interventions helped contain the pandemic in the island nation, the economic challenges since remain, especially with Sri Lanka’s crucial tourism, export and remittances sectors badly hit.

According to officials at the Ministry of Foreign Relations in Colombo, a special “travel bubble” set up for the purpose of the Chinese delegation’s visit will confine its members to Colombo, and restrict their engagements to just two meetings with the Head of State and the Prime Minister, under the “strict health protocol” prescribed by the Ministry of Health.

“The delegation will undergo a pre-departure PCR test before arriving here,” an official told The Hindu, even as some Sri Lankan netizens questioned the protocols in place, since the high-level meetings are scheduled the day after the delegation arrives.

Though Sri Lanka is facing a new wave of COVID-19, following a recent outbreak in a garment factory just outside Colombo, the country has drawn international praise, including from the World Health Organization, for successfully containing the spread of the virus in the last few months, due to the concerted efforts of the public health workers, with the support of the army.

After Sri Lanka detected its first local case of COVID-19 in March this year — a visiting Chinese tourist tested positive in January — health authorities have recorded 4,459 cases, 13 deaths and 3,278 recoveries so far. In addition to closing airports, except for select repatriation flights, the Foreign Relations Ministry had also issued a note to all missions, outlining the protocol for resident diplomats and UN representatives returning to the island nation after travel abroad. The requirements, in addition to a pre-departure PCR test, or one on arrival, include self-quarantine for 14 days.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/820wb4/article32806215.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-YANGJIECHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/high-powered-chinese-delegation-visits-sri-lanka/article32806216.ece
15,2020/10/08,Democrats flay Trump for announcing new curbs on H-1B visas sans public scrutiny,"In a move which will affect thousands of Indian IT professionals, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Tuesday announced the interim final rule

The Democratic Party has criticised President Donald Trump for announcing “sweeping changes” to the H-1B nonimmigrant visa programme in decades without public scrutiny, saying it is clearly an attempt to score last-minute political points ahead of the November 3 presidential election.

In a move which will affect thousands of Indian IT professionals, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Tuesday announced the interim final rule, which, the Trump administration said, is aimed at protecting American workers, restoring integrity and to better guarantee that H-1B petitions are approved only for qualified beneficiaries and petitioners.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler on Wednesday said: With less than 30 days to go before the elections, the Trump administration announced that it will implement the most sweeping changes to the H-1B visa programme we have seen in decades — and will do so by skirting the normal notice and comment process required by the Administrative Procedure Act .

The powerful Democrat from New York said while the programme can certainly benefit from reforms, the U.S. laws require that the public be provided with adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to comment before such reforms are implemented.

This simply cannot be accomplished to the degree required through an interim final rule and the administration knows this. This is clearly an attempt to score the last-minute political points, Mr. Nadler said.

The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows U.S. companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.

The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.

Such a decision by the Trump administration will have an adverse impact on thousands of Indian IT professionals. Already a large number of Indians on the H-1B visas have lost their jobs and are headed back home during the coronavirus pandemic that has severely hit the U.S. economy.

Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee Chair Zoe Lofgren said that over the years, she had introduced several bills that would reform the H-1B programme to prohibit substandard wages and ensure that unscrupulous employers don’t abuse the system to the detriment of U.S. workers.

While the system needs updating, changes, this must not be rushed through without adequate input from the public.

Further, the Congress set forth very clear parameters when it created the H-1B programme and the administration has admitted that the new DHS rule will affect more than one-third of H-1B petitions that have been lawfully filed and approved for decades, she said, adding that she expects this too will be quickly enjoined by the court as has been the case with so many of this administration’s “unlawful” policies.

Reacting to the criticism, the ruling Republican Party leaders said that the move will address abuses in the high-skilled guest worker programme used to displace American workers with low-paid foreign labour.

Republican Senator Chuck Grassley applauded the Trump administration’s move to crackdown on widespread abuses within the H-1B visa programme.

I have long expressed concern that the H-1B programme, as it currently operates, undermines the wages and job opportunities of American workers and contains inadequate protections for American and immigrant workers alike.

Instead of being used to fill legitimate gaps in the labour force, the H-1B programme is often abused to simply replace American workers with cheap guest worker labour. That abuse needs to stop and I strongly support the efforts, Mr. Grassley said.

The DHS on Wednesday said that while the programme intended to allow employers to fill gaps in their workforce and remain competitive in the global economy, it has expanded far beyond that, often to the detriment of U.S. workers.

Data shows that more than half-a-million H-1B non-immigrants in the United States have been used to displace U.S. workers, which has led to reduced wages in a number of industries and stagnation of wages in certain occupations, it said.

In a separate statement, American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) opposed the move.

AILA president Jennifer Minear said foreign workers play a vital role in the American economy but these regulations will create nearly insurmountable barriers to their hiring.

Not only do these rules inappropriately scapegoat immigrants for the ills of our current economic downturn but they are also self-defeating.

These rules will undoubtedly hamstring a process proven to bring some of the world’s best and brightest into American businesses. American workers and businesses only stand to suffer as a result of these changes until these rules are challenged and overturned in court, he said.

Contrary to the narrative promoted by the DHS and DOL and echoed by restrictionist groups, these rules will have crippling effects on American businesses and the economy at large, said Benjamin Johnson, AILA’s executive director.

These regulations will lay the groundwork for the pricing out of foreign labour, which is essential to the solvency of countless American businesses. Under the guise of economic recovery, the government is essentially halting the pipeline of global talent needed for innovation and economic success, Johnson added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tczvjf/article32263809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/H1B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/democrats-flay-trump-for-announcing-new-curbs-on-h-1b-visas-sans-public-scrutiny/article32804872.ece
16,2020/10/08,U.S. Presidential election 2020 | Donald Trump says no to virtual debate with Joe Biden,"The Commission on Presidential Debates said Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden will appear from remote locations, while voters and the moderator will ask them questions from the original debate site in Miami.

President Donald Trump vowed Thursday not to participate in next week’s debate with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden after organizers announced it will take place virtually because of the president’s diagnosis of COVID-19.

Also read: Brawling in Cleveland: On Trump-Biden debate

""I’m not going to do a virtual debate,” Mr. Trump told Fox Business News, moments after the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates announced the changes.

The shakeup comes a week before Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden were set to square off for the second presidential debate in Miami. Mr. Biden’s campaign insisted its candidate was ready to move forward, but the future of the event is now in serious doubt.

The Commission on Presidential Debates made the decision unilaterally, citing the need “to protect the health and safety of all involved with the second presidential debate.”

When Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Kamala Harris squared off for their only vice presidential debate in Salt Lake City on Wednesday night, they shared a stage but were separated by plexiglass to prevent the spread of the virus.

Mr. Trump’s campaign said the president would do a rally instead of the debate.

""For the swamp creatures at the Presidential Debate Commission to now rush to Joe Biden’s defense by unilaterally canceling an in-person debate is pathetic,” Bill Stepien, Trump campaign manager said in a statement. “The safety of all involved can easily be achieved without canceling a chance for voters to see both candidates go head to head. We’ll pass on this sad excuse to bail out Joe Biden and do a rally instead.”

Trump was hospitalized for three days but is now back at the White House recovering. He has vowed to return to the campaign trail soon. Still, the commission’s move is yet another indication that the presidential election is being dominated by the virus - defying the president’s monthslong attempts to underplay it and declare that the country was ready to move on.

Trump is thought to be trailing in key battleground states. Even before his COVID-19 diagnosis, he was widely criticized for his chaotic performance during last week’s first presidential debate in Cleveland. Next week’s debate, and a third one set for the following week in Nashville, would have been a chance for him to attempt to reset the election and potentially change its trajectory.

Biden aides argued that Mr. Trump’s pulling out could be a boon to their candidate. Given reactions to the chaotic first debate, they believe most voters, especially undecided voters, will see the president as avoiding a second debate out of his own interests, not because he dislikes the format.

""Vice President Biden looks forward to speaking directly to the American people,” deputy Biden campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement.

Mr. Biden said earlier in the week that he was “looking forward to being able to debate him” but added “we’re going to have to follow very strict guidelines.” He said he and Mr. Trump “shouldn’t have a debate” as long as the president remains COVID positive.

The Commission on Presidential Debates announced early Thursday the candidates would “participate from separate remote locations” while the participants and moderator remain in Miami, it said. Moments later, Mr. Trump vowed to skip the event entirely.

Mr. Trump was diagnosed with the coronavirus a week ago, but in a Tuesday tweet said he looked forward to debating Biden a second time, “It will be great!” he tweeted.

Mr. Trump was still contagious with the virus when he was discharged from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Monday but his doctors have not provided any detailed update on his status. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 can be contagious for as many as - and should isolate for at least - 10 days.

It’s not the first debate in which the candidates are not in the same room. In 1960, the third presidential debate between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy was broadcast with the two candidates on opposite coasts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eb9rnl/article32803788.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMP-BIDEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-election-2020-donald-trump-says-no-to-virtual-debate-with-joe-biden/article32803789.ece
17,2020/10/08,Kyrgyzstan's President Sooronbay Jeenbekov missing as power vacuum persists,"Kyrgyzstan's pro-Russia President Sooronbay Jeenbekov has not been seen in public since unrest began over Sunday's vote

The whereabouts of Kyrgyzstan's pro-Russia President were unknown on October 8 as a power vacuum persisted after disputed parliamentary elections plunged the Central Asian country into a new bout of political chaos.

Sooronbay Jeenbekov has not been seen in public since unrest began over Sunday's vote which was won by his supporters but opponents as well as monitors said was marred by widespread vote-buying.

Clashes have already left at least one dead and hundreds injured, with a decision to annul the results of the polls doing little to ease the tensions.

The crisis is the latest political turbulence to sweep through the volatile ex-Soviet state bordering China which has seen two revolutions and three of its Presidents either jailed or sent into exile since independence.

Mr. Jeenbekov has called for a return to a rule of law, but several lawmakers in the Parliament have said that there is no way to solve the growing impasse without his resignation or impeachment.

As of October 8, candidates from self-styled opposition parties claimed to control the state prosecutor's office, the national security committee and the Interior Ministry.

Kursan Asanov, who has positioned himself as acting Interior Minister, said that Mr. Jeenbekov's location was ""unknown"" but added that police were not searching for the Head of State.

The government-appointed Interior Minister Kashkar Junushaliyev, a rival of Mr. Asanov, had ""fled like a coward"" when the unrest began, Mr. Asanov claimed, without offering proof.

Mr. Asanov also pledged to ensure there would be no repeat of ethnic violence that left hundreds dead following an uprising in 2010. But there was no visible police presence outside key government buildings in the capital Bishkek on October 8.

Mr. Jeenbekov's office insisted in a statement that the incumbent President was in Bishkek and ""personally in talks with political forces"". Yet Mr. Jeenbekov has made no public appearances since the unrest started.

Confusion over PM

Mr. Jeenbekov is believed to enjoy the support of key ally Russia, which has called for a return to stability in the republic and beefed up security at a military base it maintains not far from the capital.

He has ruled Kyrgyzstan since 2017.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that Russia was ""deeply concerned"" about a ""situation resembling a mess and chaos"". But he said it was premature to discuss whether Mr. Jeenbekov should be offered refuge in Russia.

A meeting of Kyrgyz lawmakers on October 7 night was seen failing to resolve the deadlock, with no majority for impeachment.

Confrontations between groups of supporters in Bishkek have continued as rival groups contest the Prime Minister position.

Sadyr Japarov, a populist politician claimed the position on October 6 following an extraordinary session of Parliament, as hundreds of his supporters flooded into the capital.

But at least two other groups — one consisting of several losing parties — have since put forward their own candidates for the post.

A parliamentary press spokesman told AFP that ""around 70 lawmakers"" — a majority of the Parliament, had voted for Mr. Japarov as Prime Minister. Many observers have cast doubt over the legitimacy of the vote, which took place in a three-star hotel.

Mr. Japarov, a headstrong nationalist known for his opposition to the company operating Kyrgyzstan's largest gold mine, was freed from jail by protesters during a tumultuous night of unrest on Monday that also saw former President Almazbek Atambayev released.

His supporters attempted to enter the building housing the Prime Minister's on office on Wednesday night, but its doors were guarded by a 500-strong voluntary defence unit, who formed a human chain until the supporters dispersed, eyewitness told AFP.

Politically neutral voluntary defence units also control the building where Mr. Jeenbekov's administration and the Parliament are housed, which was seized by protesters in the early hours of Tuesday.

It was not clear whether Mr. Jeenbekov had signed off on the Tuesday resignation of outgoing Prime Minister Kubatbek Boronov or Mr. Japarov's candidacy.

Other Ministers, however, appeared to remain in their position as they held an online meeting to discuss rising coronavirus cases amid other items of government.

18,2020/10/08,Russian sea pollution forms massive moving slick,"The Russian branch of Greenpeace has described the situation as an “ecological disaster”

Suspected toxic waste pollution off Russia's Kamchatka peninsula that caused the mass deaths of marine animals has formed a moving slick stretching 40 kilometres along the Pacific coastline, researchers said Thursday.

The Far Eastern Federal University said in a statement the pollution was between 100 and 300 metres wide in some places, had a green hue and was creating an unusual foam while floating south along the Russian coast.

The waste was previously thought to be stationary and confined mostly to one beach, but researchers who carried out aerial photography said it was “gradually moving south” towards the contested Kuril Islands “without diminishing in size”.

Kirill Vinnikov, the head of a biology lab at the university, also noted that the pollution was not disintegrating and had clear dimensions. The statement said researchers collected pollution samples from a helicopter despite difficult weather conditions and an analysis will be carried out in the Far East city of Vladivostok.

Locals sounded the alarm in late September as surfers experienced stinging eyes from the water and sea creatures including seals, octopuses and sea urchins washed up dead.

The Russian branch of Greenpeace has described the situation as an “ecological disaster”.

Russian authorities on Wednesday opened a criminal probe, citing the illegal handling of dangerous substances and “pollution of the marine environment”.

Kamchatka governor Vladimir Solodov previously said the most likely source was the Kozelsky site, 35 kilometres outside the region's main city Petropavlovsk-Kamchatksy and used since the Soviet era to store poisonous substances deep in the ground.

Analysts told the Russian investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta and the RIA Novosti news agency that toxic rocket fuel from a nearby military facility could be responsible for the damage.

Yet Solodov on Thursday ruled out that heptyl was behind the incident, saying samples had come back negative for the rocket fuel. He said tests indicated the presence of fuel products but not in high enough concentrations to wipe out marine animals in such large numbers.

20,2020/10/08,"New fighting as Russia, U.S. and France seek Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire","The ceasefire talks mark the start of a concerted drive by the three powers to halt fighting that flared on September 27.

Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenians fought new clashes on Thursday before talks at which the United States, France and Russia will discuss how to secure a ceasefire and avert a wider war in the South Caucasus.

Azeri Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov will meet U.S., Russian and French envoys in Geneva on Thursday and Armenia's Foreign Minister, Zohrab Mnatsakanyan, is expected to meet officials from the three countries in Moscow on Monday.

The talks mark the start of a concerted drive by the three powers to halt fighting that flared on September 27, increasing concerns about the security of pipelines in Azerbaijan that carry natural gas and oil to Europe.

Washington, Paris and Moscow are co-chairs of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE) Minsk Group that has led mediation in decades of conflict over the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.

Under international law, Nagorno-Karabakh belongs to Azerbaijan but it is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians, who broke away in a 1991-94 war that killed about 30,000.

“The position of the United States has been clear and has not changed: both sides must cease hostilities immediately and work with the Minsk Group Co-Chairs to return to substantive negotiations as soon as possible,” a U.S. spokesman in Geneva said.

Hours before the talks were due to start, Azerbaijan said the city of Ganja, deep inside the former Soviet republic, had been shelled by Armenian forces.

One civilian had been killed in Azerbaijan's Goranboy region and other villages and towns were fired on by ethnic Armenian forces, it said.

Azeri authorities say 30 civilians have been killed and 143 injured since September 27 but have not disclosed information about military casualties.

Nagorno-Karabakh said its main administrative centre, Stepanakert, had been shelled and that 30 servicemen had been killed, taking its military death toll to 350 since September 27. It says 19 civilians have also been killed and many wounded.

Following the latest reports of fighting, Armenia said it had dismissed the head of its National Security Service in a presidential decree. It gave no reason.

Fears of a wider war

The fighting has raised international concern that Turkey, a close ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia, could be sucked into the conflict.

Also read: Tensions mount as Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces fight for fourth day

The warring sides have ignored repeated ceasefire calls and the Azeri and Armenian leaders have been at odds over their conditions for halting fighting.

Azeri President Ilham Aliyev's main demand is for Armenia to set a timetable for a withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding Azeri territories, and wants Turkey involved in peacemaking.

He told Euronews in an interview that Bayramov's attendance at the Geneva talks “shows who wants negotiations.”

Azerbaijan's foreign ministry dismissed calls for a unilateral ceasefire which it said “maintain the status quo based on occupation.”

Armenia has ruled out a withdrawal from territory it considers historic homelands. It has also accused Turkey of military involvement in the conflict and says it has sent in mercenaries, allegations denied by Ankara.

“Our position has been and remains that the Karabakh issue cannot be solved through violence,” Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan told Euronews.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who has accused the Minsk Group of neglecting the crisis for decades, said in comments published on Thursday that Ankara would continue to support “our Azerbaijani brothers with all our resources.”

The European Commission says it has sealed a deal with pharmaceutical company Gilead to buy 500,000 treatment courses of remdesivir.

Remdesivir was approved as a treatment for the coronavirus by the Commission in July.

22,2020/10/08,Supersonic travel: Boom Technology Inc rolls out demonstrator jets,"Today's planned supersonic jets are under pressure from environmentalists and airports to meet noise levels and carbon emissions standards for conventional planes.

Boom Supersonic on Wednesday unveiled its first demonstrator aircraft X-B1, which is scheduled to begin flight testing next year, in a milestone for the U.S. startup planning a commercial airliner that can conquer the sound barrier.

A handful of U.S. companies are vying to bring back supersonic passenger travel which died out with the Anglo-French Concorde's retirement in 2003.

Today's planned supersonic jets, while quieter and more fuel efficient than the Concorde, are under pressure from environmentalists and airports to meet noise levels and carbon emissions standards for conventional planes.

Denver-based Boom said in a release that XB-1 will undergo a carbon-neutral flight test program which is to start next year in Mojave, California.

XB-1 has a 71 foot-long fuselage, a carbon-composite airframe and three GE-designed J85-15 engines, the statement said.

The aircraft's first flight is targeted for the backhalf of 2021, with entry-into-service of the company's supersonic airliner Overture expected by the end of the decade, Boom Chief Executive Blake Scholl said in an interview.

Overture, a supersonic airliner with 65 to 88 seats priced initially at business class fares, would cut transatlantic flying time in half to about three-and-half hours. The company says it has orders from Japan Airlines Co and Virgin Group.

Scholl said he expects the aviation market, hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, to rebound by the time Overture comes to market.

“The nice thing about supersonic jets is if you're concerned about time on airplanes, less time is better,” he said.

Scholl founded Boom in 2014 after serving in leadership roles at Amazon and Groupon, according to the company's website.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xs2ij3/article32802416.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AEROSPACE-SUPERSONICJETS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/supersonic-travel-boom-technology-inc-rolls-out-demonstrator-jets/article32802417.ece
23,2020/10/08,Iran frees rights activist after more than 8 years in prison,"Narges Mohammadi was freed late Wednesday after serving 8 1/2 years in prison.

Iran has released a prominent human rights activist who campaigned against the death penalty, Iranian media reported Thursday.

The semiofficial ISNA news agency quoted judiciary official Sadegh Niaraki as saying that Narges Mohammadi was freed late Wednesday after serving 8 1/2 years in prison. She was sentenced to 10 years in 2016 while already incarcerated.

Niaraki said Mohammadi was released based on a law that allows a prison sentence to be commutated if the related court agrees.

In July, rights group Amnesty International demanded Mohammadi’s immediate release because of serious pre-existing health conditions and showing suspected COVID-19 symptoms. The Thursday report did not refer to her possible illness.

Mohammadi was sentenced in Tehran’s Revolutionary Court on charges including planning crimes to harm the security of Iran, spreading propaganda against the government and forming and managing an illegal group.

She was in a prison in the northwestern city of Zanjan, some 280 kilometers (174 miles) northwest of the capital Tehran.

Mohammadi was close to Iranian Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, who founded the banned Defenders of Human Rights Center. Ebadi left Iran after the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009, which touched off unprecedented protests and harsh crackdowns by authorities.

24,2020/10/08,Nobel Literature prize to be awarded after years of tumult,"In 2018 the award was postponed after sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy, the secretive body that chooses the winners, and sparked a mass exodus of members.

The Nobel Prize for Literature is set to be awarded Thursday after several years of controversy and scandal for the world’s pre-eminent literary accolade.

In 2018 the award was postponed after sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy, the secretive body that chooses the winners, and sparked a mass exodus of members.

After the academy revamped itself in a bid to regain the trust of the Nobel Foundation, two laureates were named last year, with the 2018 prize going to Poland’s Olga Tokarczuk and the 2019 award to Austria’s Peter Handke.

Handke’s prize caused a storm of protest: a strong supporter of the Serbs during the 1990s Balkan wars, he has been called an apologist for Serbian war crimes. Several countries including Albania, Bosnia and Turkey boycotted the Nobel awards ceremony in protest, and a member of the committee that nominates candidates for the literature prize resigned.

This year the academy is likely to seek a more harmonious choice for the 10 million kronor (more than USD 1.1 million) prize.

Authors often mentioned as contenders include Kenya’s Ngugi Wa Thiong’o, Canadian poet Anne Carson and Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami.

The vice presidential debate featured plexiglass barriers to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. They were no match for the night’s most talked-about intruder - a fly that briefly buzzed around the stage before landing and staying on Mike Pence’s head.

The incident went unmentioned onstage, with the Republican vice president and Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris continuing to focus on the discussion of systemic racism in the justice system.

But as the insect took up residence on Mr. Pence’s white hair, the social media firestorm was immediate - and intense. It easily created more, well, buzz than nearly anything else that occurred.

“That’s not on your TV. It’s on his head,” tweeted MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow. “The fly knows,” tweeted author Stephen King. Others joked about the creature perhaps getting stuck in hair spray - or possibly now being a prime candidate for coronavirus testing.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden immediately got in on the act, tweeting a photo of himself clutching an orange flyswatter under the heading “Pitch in $5 to help this campaign fly.” Moments later, he tweeted again, this time highlighting “Flywillvote.com,” which took users to a website set up for his campaign to help supporters make plans to vote.

Mr. Pence had spent much of the night shaking his head in response to Ms. Harris’ answers. But the vice president didn’t appear to notice the fly’s arrival. Despite his talking and normal body movements, the hot stage lights and those virus-fighting barriers, the fly was unperturbed. It finally flew away on its own.

Wednesday night’s visitor wasn’t the first fly to take center stage at a presidential debate. In 2016, one briefly landed between Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s eyes during a town hall-style debate with now-President Donald Trump. Ms. Clinton didn’t flinch.

President Barack Obama, however, took action when confronted with an airborne distraction during the taping of a television interview in 2009. Mr. Obama stopped speaking to swat at a buzzing fly and tell it to “get out of here.” As interviewer John Harwood quipped, “That’s the most persistent fly I’ve ever seen,” Mr. Obama concentrated on its path and swatted it dead.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ce1p7g/article32800876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-MIKE-PENCE-AND-KAMALA-HARRIS-TAKE-PART-IN-VICE-PRESIDENTIAL-D,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-vice-presidential-debate-fly-on-pences-head-generates-buzz/article32800877.ece

The World Economic Forum (WEF) on Wednesday said it will hold its Annual Meeting 2021 in Lucerne-Burgenstock, Switzerland, from May 18 to 21, as against the traditional venue of ski resort town Davos in January-end.

The change in schedule and venue was necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Announcing the new place and schedule, the WEF said the annual meeting will take place as long as all conditions are in place to guarantee the health and safety of participants and the host community.

In addition, as previously announced in late August, the Annual Meeting 2021 will be preceded by high-level ‘Davos Dialogues’, digitally convened by the WEF during the week of January 25, when key global leaders will share their views on the state of the world in 2021.

The Annual Meeting 2021 in Lucerne-Burgenstock will be held around the theme of ‘The Great Reset’

The meeting will focus on the solutions required to address the world’s most pressing challenges.

Global leaders will come together to design a common recovery path, to shape ‘The Great Reset’ in the post-COVID-19 era and rebuild a more cohesive and sustainable society.

The Annual Meeting 2021 will combine both in-person and digital elements. Participants in Lucerne-Burgenstock will be connected with a network of 400 hubs around the world, providing the opportunity for a dialogue with the Forum’s young Global Shapers, to ensure openness and inclusion.

Traditionally, the WEF holds its annual summit in the Swiss ski resort town of Davos in January.

The high-profile event is attended by thousands of global leaders from fields of business, governance, politics, art and culture, civil society and academia, among others.

Earlier in June, the WEF had said it will adopt a new twin-summit format for its next annual meeting by bringing together leaders from across the globe for in-person as well as virtual dialogues with the theme of ‘The Great Reset’

27,2020/10/08,Covid-19 | Sri Lanka closes key state offices as virus outbreak surges,"The outbreak that surfaced this week has grown to 1,034 cases with more than 2,000 others asked to quarantine at home.

Authorities in Sri Lanka closed key government offices and further expanded a curfew on Thursday to contain a surging coronavirus outbreak.

The foreign ministry closed the consular affairs office for the week and suspended all services to prevent the public from congregating. The ministry said it would only accept queries and documentation assistance related to deaths of Sri Lankans overseas, strictly by appointment.

Other departments providing services related to revenue, immigration, pensions, vehicle license and registrations also closed for the week, and a state-sponsored exhibition was canceled.

The outbreak that surfaced this week has grown to 1,034 cases with more than 2,000 others asked to quarantine at home.

It is centered around a garment factory in the Colombo suburbs where the first patient and many others worked. Police have widened the curfew in the suburbs where many of the patients live. Schools have closed, public gatherings were ordered halted and restrictions were imposed on public transport.

The cluster comes after the Indian Ocean island nation reported going two months without any community infections, and health officials say it poses a high risk of spreading the virus because employees at the factory worked close together and also went home every day and mingled with others in society.

29,2020/10/08,"U.S. vice presidential debate | Trump administration’s handling of COVID-19 a ‘greatest failure’, says Kamala Harris","Though there were heated exchanges, it was a far more respectful affair than the opening presidential debate eight days earlier

Democratic vice president nominee Kamala Harris described the Trump administration’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic as the “greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history” of the U.S. as she opened the only vice presidential debate with a sharp attack on Vice President Mike Pence, who leads the president’s coronavirus task force.

Also read: Donald Trump, Joe Biden clash in chaotic first debate

The 55-year-old California Senator said Americans have sacrificed too much due to the “incompetence of this administration”, referring to the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed over 200,000 American lives and battered the country’s economy.

There were heated exchanges early on, but overall it was a far more respectful affair than the opening presidential debate eight days earlier. While Trump was the aggressor then, butting in and almost yelling, Pence demonstrated the discipline and Midwestern folksy style he is known for.

“The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,” Harris said at the beginning of the debate in Salt Lake City, Utah on Wednesday night.

President Donald Trump, who tested positive for COVID-19, is facing criticism over his handling of the health crisis and downplaying the threat from the deadly virus. Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden has accused Trump of hiding the facts from the American people.

Harris said people needed information they may “not want people to hear, but they need to hear so they can protect themselves”.

“They’ve had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration,” she said.

On his part, Pence, 61, said that steps taken by President Trump have saved hundreds and thousands of American lives.

“Our nation’s gone through a very challenging time this year, he said. I want the American people to know, from the very first day, President Trump has put the health of America first,” the Republican vice presidential candidate, said.

On her plan to handle the crisis, Harris said that the Biden administration would focus on “contact tracing, testing, administration of the vaccine, and making sure that it will be free for all.”

“That is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have, knowing that we have to get a hold of what has been going on,” she said.

Harris also said that if there is a coronavirus vaccine available during Trump’s administration that is not embraced by scientific advisers, she will not take it.

But if the country’s top scientific advisers like Dr. Anthony Fauci back the vaccine, she would.

Harris, who aspires to be the first woman vice-president in history, and Pence were separated by plexiglass barriers. They sat 12.25 feet apart on the debate stage.

Harris, whose mother was from India and father from Jamaica, scripted history in August when she was picked by the Democratic Party as its vice presidential nominee. She is the first Black woman and the first Asian-American woman to be selected as the vice presidential nominee of a major political party in the U.S.

It is for the first time in the American history that an Indian-origin person has taken up the podium for a vice presidential debate.

The debate, moderated by journalist Susan Page, is divided into nine segments of approximately 10 minutes each.

Political analysts believe that an aggressive Harris will easily prevail over Pence during the only vice-presidential debate and help Biden, 77, to widen his lead over Trump, 74.

Biden, in the last few days, has widened his lead over Trump by double digit. The debate comes nearly a week after the first of the three presidential debates in Cleveland on September 29 which was marked by angry interruptions and bitter accusations.

Plexiglass an extra participant on the stage

There were three participants in Wednesday night’s vice presidential debate: Republican Mike Pence, Democrat Kamala Harris and the plexiglass between them.

The clear partitions went largely unmentioned as Pence and Harris directed criticism at one another, and the home audience couldn’t see them in split-screen TV images.

But when the cameras showed Pence or Harris from the side, the candidates’ reflections were evident on the barriers.

It was a reminder of the coronavirus, prominent in the evening’s discussion. They were late additions to the stage in Salt Lake City, underscoring how the pandemic rages on less than a month before the Nov. 3 election.

Pence and Harris were stationed at desks spaced more than 12 feet (3.7 meters) apart, each with a partition on the side facing the other candidate.

Sen. Harris’ team requested plexiglass be used after President Donald Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19 shortly after his first presidential debate against Democrat Joe Biden last week in Cleveland.

Pence’s team, meanwhile, insisted they were not medically necessary, an objection that came as Trump returned to the White House.

Australia has nominated outgoing Finance Minister Mathias Cormann as its candidate for the next secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday.

On Wednesday, Ms. Verma’s name figured in the JD(U)’s first list of 115 candidates as the party’s official candidate from the Cheria-Bariyarpur constituency of Begusarai district.

Ms. Verma, who was the Social Welfare Minister in the Nitish Kumar government, had to resign after her husband, Chandrashekhar Verma, was implicated in the shelter home scandal. She was arrested and sent to jail under the Arms Act in November 2018 after the police recovered cartridges from her house when they raided it in connection with the shelter home abuse case. Subsequently, she was granted bail by the Patna High Court.

At a press conference, Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev and party spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said the BJP-JD(U) alliance should immediately cancel her candidature if they were ‘serious’ about women security.

Ms. Shrinate targeted the BJP and claimed that from Kathua to Hathras, there have been several instances across the country where BJP leaders have come out in support of the perpetrators of crimes against women.

In another development Satya Prakash, son of former Union minister and RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, joined the ruling JD(U) in presence of State party chief Basistha Narayan Singh at the party headquarters.

On the other hand, the RJD is said to have given a party ticket to the wife of don-turned-politician Ramakishore Singh from the Mahnar Assembly constituency. Earlier, senior RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh had quit the party in protest against the likelihood of Mr. Singh joining the RJD.

“Altogether six parties are here on one platform to form the Grand Democratic Secular Front and it appeals to the people of Bihar to give us one chance to see how Bihar would be a developed State in five years,” said the Front’s coordinator and leader of the Samajwadi Janata Dal (Democratic), Devendra Yadav.

Later, senior State BJP leader and Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi took a dig at the RJD: “The bahubali (strongman) against whose induction into the party Raghuvansh Prasad Singh had fought till his last breath, the RJD bulldozed Mr. [Raghuvansh Prasad] Singh’s ideal and respect for poor people by giving a party ticket to his [Ramakishore Singh’s] wife.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mu9fz3/article32806961.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIHAR-six-party-frontjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/six-parties-form-a-new-front-in-bihar-with-rslps-kushwaha-as-cm-candidate/article32805378.ece
35,2020/10/08,"Bihar Assembly polls | LJP is highly confused; it is not even clear who they are fighting against, says Bhupendra Yadav","The NDA is fighting for development under PM Modi’s leadership with Nitish Kumar as chief ministerial candidate, says the BJP poll in-charge for Bihar Bhupendra Yadav

BJP general secretary in charge of Bihar Bhupendra Yadav clarifies that the NDA’s campaign in the State is based on development work done under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Lok Janshakti Party is not part of this arrangement.

It is being said that the Lok Janshakti Party’s decision to fight alone in Bihar is some sort of Plan B by the BJP to break the big brother status of Janata Dal (U) in the NDA in Bihar? What do you say?

These conspiracy theories are laughable. The BJP has only one plan in the election and that is to fight it along with the JD(U). We have spelt out that plan but in case there is some confusion, I am spelling it out again. BJP will contest on 121 of the 243 seats, the JD(U) will fight on 122. The JD(U) will accommodate Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) under its quota of seats, while BJP will accommodate Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP). That is the only plan we have.

LJP is not a part of this arrangement because the party chose to fight alone. The NDA is fighting for development in Bihar under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership and vision, with Nitish Kumar as the undisputed chief ministerial candidate of the alliance.

Also read: Bihar Assembly election | Fewer star campaigners this time

There is talk that many BJP leaders, desirous of fighting polls on seats now given to JD(U) in the seat adjustment will be fighting on an LJP ticket. What will be the attitude of the party if that happens?

Anyone who has left the BJP to fight an election on the ticket of any other party, including LJP, is to be considered as a person ousted from the BJP. As I have stated, we are fighting the election in alliance with JD(U) and have mutually agreed upon seat-sharing deal with them. These are rumours being spread by the opposition to confuse voters. But the voters are smart enough to see through the ploy.

As for the LJP, I see them as a highly confused lot. It is not even clear who the LJP is fighting against. They say they are against RJD, but the LJP leader has gone on to congratulate RJD leader Tejashwi Pratap Yadav. They are fighting the NDA, but at the Centre, they continue to have ministerial berth in the NDA government.

Their own party is ridden with infighting with allegations and counter-allegations of the leadership selling party tickets. LJP needs to do some hard thinking to figure out what exactly they want.

What will be the NDA’s campaign points with regard to the Bihar polls?

The NDA has entered the election with the slogan of “Atmanirbhar Bihar”. A lot of work has been done by the NDA government on issues of roads, power and water. Prime Minister Modi has launched fisheries and animal husbandry projects worth more than ₹20,000 crore in Bihar. Urban infrastructure projects worth ₹541 crore have been launched. For migrant workers, the Prime Minister Modi has extended the distribution of free ration under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana till Chhath Puja in November.

Over the last few years people in Bihar have been receiving benefits under Ujjwala Yojana and other benefits through DBTs, which earlier were just promises. This relentless development work will continue in Bihar under the vision of PM Modi and chief ministership of Nitish Kumar.

These are the first polls being held since the COVID19 pandemic broke out, and there are worries that voters, especially middle class may not turn up in large numbers. Do you have a strategy for turning out the vote?

As much as 89% of Bihar’s population is rural. The Election Commission has reduced the maximum number of voters per booth from 1,500 to 1,000. It has also increased polling stations from about 65,000 to 1 lakh. To ensure the voter gets to the polling booth, the NDA in Bihar has organised door-to-door campaign across 3,000 panchayats.

The BJP has given a lot more tickets to women. They are active participants in electoral politics. This will also help attract more women to vote. More people-connect programmes will be undertaken because there is no doubt that there is a pandemic but the process of democracy must not be weakened. For democracy to be strengthened, it is important that people participate in elections and seek accountability from their leaders.

None of this shall happen at the cost of social distancing and other norms in place. The Election Commission is overseeing it and as the party in power, NDA too will do everything to ensure no one’s safety is compromised and that people feel confident enough to come out and vote.

The poll is being billed as BJP Vs RJD. Do you agree with this characterisation?

The election is NDA versus UPA. The NDA has BJP, JD(U), HAM and VIP. We are together solidly and will form the government when the election results are announced on November 10.

As for the UPA, I am reminded of Mohammed Rafi’s famous song Ek dil ke tukde hazar hue, koi yahaan gira koi wahaan gira (The heart has broken into a 1,000; pieces falling here and there). This so-called Mahagathbandhan first forced HAM to leave, then they back-stabbed Mukesh Sahni's VIP, forcing them out of the coalition. Even the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has decided to fight on its own. So the UPA alliance is signalling that it has no place for backwards, Mahadalits and tribals; instead there are tying up with the Ultra Left who are part of the tukde-tukde gang, interested in violent struggle to divide India. The only thing binding the UPA constituents is hunger for power now.

I want to use this opportunity to ask the Congress, what drove it to join hands with the Ultra Left, Maoist Leninist party, Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), along with CPI(M) and CPI?",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/40s0fw/article32803324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BHUPENDRAYADAV,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-polls-ljp-is-highly-confused-it-is-not-even-clear-who-they-are-fighting-against-says-bhupendra-yadav/article32803325.ece
36,2020/10/08,Bihar Assembly polls | Party ticket eludes ex-Bihar police chief Gupteshwar Pandey for second time,"His name did not figure in the list of 115 JD(U) candidates released on Wednesday

Former Bihar Director General of Police Gupteshwar Pandey was unlucky a second time as his name did not figure in the list of 115 Janata Dal-United (JD-U) candidates, released on Wednesday, to contest the upcoming State Assembly poll.

A 1987 batch IPS officer Mr. Pandey had recently taken voluntary retirement from the service, and with the State government ready to waive the customary three month cooling-off period, he joined the ruling JD(U) to contest the Assembly elections from what was considered likely to be Buxar, his home district.

Earlier, in 2009 too, he had taken voluntary retirement from the police service to contest the Lok Sabha poll on a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket from the Buxar parliamentary constituency, but was denied the party ticket at the last hour, after which he was controversially reinstated into the police service nine months later.

In a latest post on Facebook late on Wednesday night, Mr. Pandey expressed his feelings to his well-wishers. “After my retirement from services everyone has hope that I’ll contest the assembly poll this time but I’m not contesting the election…there is no need to be desperate and to feel let down..have patience…my life has been fraught with struggle and I’ll keep serving people..please don’t call me as I’m disturbed with phone calls of my well-wishers,” Mr. Pandey said in the post.

Mr. Pandey has over 7 lakh followers for his Facebook account.

Earlier, when asked if he would be joining politics after taking voluntary retirement, Mr. Pandey had shot back at mediapersons, “Is it a crime to join politics? Is it unconstitutional? Is it unethical?”

Later, after joining the JD(U) at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s official residence, in the presence of Mr. Kumar and other senior party leaders, he had said that he would contest the upcoming Assembly poll to “serve people”.

It is said that he was all set to contest the poll from Buxar but, under the National Democratic Alliance, Buxar has gone to the BJP’s kitty.

District BJP workers and leaders had registered their strong protest to the party leadership that they would not accept Mr. Pandey as their candidate.

The upper caste dominated Buxar seat has been a BJP stronghold, represented thrice by Sukhda Pandey, an articulate university professor and leader.

However, in the 2015 Assembly poll, Congress leader Sanajy Tiwari alias Munna Tiwari had won the poll from the Buxar seat, defeating BJP candidate Pradeep Dubey.

The BJP has fielded Prashuram Chaturvedi as party candidate from Buxar seat this time.

On Tuesday, it was rumoured that Mr. Pandey would join the BJP to contest the poll from Buxar, but amid simmering seat-sharing discussions among the NDA allies and strong protests by local party leaders against his candidature, Mr. Pandey’s luck proved elusive a second time.

The former police chief of Bihar had recently dominated headlines in media because of his theatrical statements on the Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case.

He had also controversially said Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty “did not have the aukaad (stature)” to make comments about CM Nitish Kumar.

He also accused the Mumbai police of not cooperating with Bihar police in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.

The Bollywood actor had hailed from State capital Patna, and an FIR was lodged by his father K. K. Singh at the local Rajiv Nagar police station in Patna.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/g65z95/article32797855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PANDEYKB,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-polls-party-ticket-eludes-ex-bihar-police-chief-gupteshwar-pandey-for-second-time/article32797856.ece

39,2020/10/08,Passenger vehicle retail sales grow first time since March,"Overall vehicle deliveries extend their decline in September

Passenger vehicle registrations rose 9.8% in September, the first retail sales growth since March, data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations show. Total vehicle deliveries, however, continued to shrink, sliding 10% to 13.44 lakh units.

Overall registrations, however, increased 11.4% from August, raising hopes of a “high growth period” in October and November due to the upcoming festivals.

PV deliveries rose to more than 1.95 lakh units last month, while two-wheelers registrations slid 12.6 to 10.16 lakh units and commercial vehicle registrations fell 33.7% to 39,600 units. Tractor deliveries surged 80.4% to 68,564 units.

“With social distancing on customers’ minds, coupled with the government’s push to further normalise business conditions and banks becoming more considerate to finance vehicles, entry level passenger vehicles saw good demand thus indicating a preference for personal transportation over public,” FADA President Vinkesh Gulati said. New model introductions and last year’s low base had also aided growth in the PV segment, he added.

Still, FADA had a caveat on the outlook.

“With the festival season round the corner and elections approaching in Bihar, the risk of COVID spread resurging may play a spoilsport in specific regions. Inventory for 2W stands at 45-50 days and PV stands at 35-40 days. Any dampener in vehicle sales during the upcoming festivals will have a catastrophic impact on dealers’ financial health,” FADA warned.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/796bn7/article32807202.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04BUCARS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/passenger-vehicle-retail-sales-grow-first-time-since-march/article32807203.ece

41,2020/10/08,LVB receives non-binding offer from Clix,"Cash-starved private sector lender Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd. (LVB) has received a non-binding offer from Clix Group for merger.

In June 2020, LVB had entered into a non-binding agreement with the Clix Group for amalgamation. On Thursday, LVB said that it had received an indicative non-binding offer from Clix Group indicating that the merger was on.

The fate of LVB merger talks have been doing rounds for the last few days, as the bank shareholders rejected the appointment of seven directors including its chief executive officer at the recently concluded Annual General Meeting due to poor results.

“Three or four options are before us to decide the best way forward,” said Shakti Sinha, independent director and member, Committee of Directors. “The board will take a final decision about the merger in the next 3-4 days.”“We are simultaneously working on parallel tracks. A process has started with Clix and we will come to a conclusion either way in the interests of the bank. Besides, we will raise funds either through rights issue, follow-on IPO, FPO or QIP and we are also exploring all the other options. As there are none in the executive position, we have to tread cautiously,” he said.

During June 2020, LVB had entered into a non-binding agreement with the Clix Group for amalgamation. And on Thursday, LVB said that it received an indicative non-binding offer from Clix Group indicating that the merger was on.

Mr. Sinha said that they need at least ₹2,500 crore to keep afloat and grow the business. The bank was mulling to raise ₹1,000 crore through merger, debt financing of ₹500 crore and balance ₹1,000 crore by selling its non-performing assets to Asset Reconstruction Companies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lvb-receives-non-binding-offer-from-clix/article32807000.ece
42,2020/10/08,Manufacturing at full steam: PM,"Modi invites Canadian firms to invest in services, production

India’s manufacturing sector is now running at full steam despite disruptions caused by the pandemic and the country wants to help the entire world in COVID-19 vaccine production efforts, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, while pitching for fresh investments from Canadian businesses.

“I want to ask you ‘What do you think about before investing in a country’… Does the country have a viable democracy, Does it have political stability, Does it have investment and business friendly policies, Does it have transparency in governance, Does it have a skilled talent pool, Does it have a large market?” the PM said, beginning his keynote address at a conference organised by Invest India and the Indian High Commission in Canada.

“These are different questions you may be asking. The undisputed answer to all these questions is one – India. There is an opportunity for everyone – institutional investors, manufacturers, supporters of innovations and infrastructure companies,” he said, urging Canadian firms to consider collaborations with India in education and agriculture, apart from investments in manufacturing and services.

“In the post-COVID world, you will often hear of various kind of problems – manufacturing, supply chain and so on.

‘Shown resilience’

Problems are natural. However, India has not let those problems be. We showed resilience and emerged as a land of solutions… Today, our manufacturing is running at full steam,” Mr. Modi said.

Stressing that the government has set up a dedicated empowered group of secretaries to ensure high-level attention and hand-holding for investors, the PM said that the government was pro-actively monetising assets across sectors such as airports, railways, highways and power transmission lines. Real estate investment trusts and infrastructure investment trusts had also been fully enabled for monetisation of public and private assets.

“We have given relief and stimulus packages for the poor and small businesses, but we have also used the opportunity to undertake structural reforms to ensure more productivity and prosperity. A trinity of reforms in education, labour and agriculture, will together impact almost every Indian. We have reformed old labour and agriculture laws to ensure greater participation of the private sector, while strengthening government safety nets,” he said, underlining that these reforms would create a win-win situation for entrepreneurs as well as the country’s hard-working people.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/awkgbh/article32806993.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09BUMODI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/manufacturing-at-full-steam-pm/article32806994.ece

At the same time, I understand and respect his desire to make this change. I am extremely grateful that he has agreed to stay on to help ensure a seamless transition,” she added.

Commenting on the development Mr. Shankar said, “I have always believed in the power of creativity and cutting-edge technology to create a better world and consider myself incredibly fortunate to have had the opportunity to do so at Star, 21CF and now at The Walt Disney Company.”

“As I look back on this journey, I take pride in having set ambitious goals in my professional career, and achieving all that we set out to do. For some time now, I have been contemplating the question of how I give back to the country, community and the industry that have given me so much,” he said.

“I think the best way to express my gratitude to all of them will be to support and mentor a new generation of entrepreneurs as they set out to create transformational solutions that will have a positive impact on countless lives. I intend to partner with global investors and pioneers to achieve this,” he said.

As more people have been forced to stay home, the interest in home furnishing has increased and online shopping grew significantly, said IKEA India on Wednesday.

“As part of our reinforced commitment to India, we have accelerated plans to meet customers in the new reality, supported our co-workers and customers during the crisis, and also took care of vulnerable communities. We have been lowering our prices for many articles to become even more affordable for our consumers,’’ said Peter Betzel, CEO and CSO, IKEA India.

The fiscal year 2020 (September 2019 - August 2020) has proved to be a significant one for IKEA India, and the company is looking forward to a strong and positive FY 2021 with a new store and smaller formats coming up in Mumbai and an increased focus on an omnichannel network, said the Netherlands-based Ingka Group that owns the homeware and homecare brand.

This year, over two million customers visited the IKEA store in Hyderabad and over 25 million customers visited the brand online. The company said it distributed 4 million meals, 20,000 products and 1.1 million face masks/PPE kits in the country through UNICEF.

Jesper Brodin, CEO, Ingka Group, said, many weeks during the year, the Ingka Group had to close 75% of the IKEA stores it operates across the world due to pandemic.

“During the last six months, we managed to quickly adapt to meet the new needs of our customers. We are determined to create a better life for people at a time when the home has never been more important,” Mr. Brodin added.

The Ingka Group has accelerated its retail transformation over the year, re-purposing its stores to fulfillment units, as well as implementing click and collect services (online), offering pick-up and ‘drive-through’ options and in some cases, even turning store car parks into COVID-19 testing facilities for the community. Despite the pandemic, the company has opened 26 new IKEA locations in Shanghai, Seoul, Moscow and Tokyo and also built a digital presence. The group has also witnessed a strong IKEA retail sales of €35.2 billion for the financial year 2020 (€36.7 billion FY19), as per the release.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ikea-india-to-raise-india-footprint-omnichannel-presence/article32805881.ece

Chennai saw the introduction of over 1.32 lakh new units between 2013 and Q3 2020, of which 61% has already been completed. In stark contrast, National Capital Region (NCR) saw over 5.54 lakh units of new supply in this period, of which just 26% (1.45 lakh units) were completed.

In Bengaluru, out of the total new supply of nearly 3.83 lakh units during the period, nearly 1.85 lakh units are ready. Hyderabad saw a new supply of 1.16 lakh units during the period, of which 51,710 units were completed.

Kolkata saw new supply of 1.41 lakh units, of which 40% or nearly 56,100 units were completed. In Pune, out of the total introduction of over 3.50 lakh units, nearly 29% (1.02 lakh units approximately) have been completed. Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) saw introduction of nearly 6.26 lakh units during the period. Of this, 28% (1.73 lakh units approximately) was completed.

Altogether 23 lakh units were introduced between 2013 and Q3 2020 across the top 7 cities, 34% (approximately 7.92 lakh units) of this is completed. Another 19% is scheduled to complete within the next 12 months, and another 19% between one to two years, the research data said.

Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Property Consultants said “Predominantly driven by end-users from the IT/ITeS sector, the conservative housing markets of the Southern cities also benefit from the proactive project completion focus of developers active there.”

Out of all the projects introduction and completed between 2013-till date, the average time to complete projects in Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad is between 4.1-4.3 years for smaller projects (with 100-500 units each) and between 5.5-5.9 years for large projects (above 500 units each). This is significantly less than the average completion time in NCR, where it is 6 years and 7.2 years, respectively.

Cumulatively, the top cities saw more than 7.92 lakh units (34%) completed out of the total of 23 lakh units introduced between 2013 and Q3 2020.

50,2020/10/08,"Valli Arunachalam serves legal notice to Ambadi Investments, Murugappa family members","Her nomination to a board seat was rejected by a majority of AIL’s shareholders last month

Valli Arunachalam has issued a legal notice to Ambadi Investments (AIL), the holding company of the ₹38,000-crore Murugappa Group, Murugappa family members and others in relation thereto, after her nomination to a board seat was rejected by a majority of AIL’s shareholders last month.

Dr. Arunachalam, 59, the eldest daughter of former executive chairman M.V. Murugappan, has been battling for the right to be recognised as her father’s successor on the AIL board since her father’s demise in 2017. Along with her mother and sister, she holds an 8.15% stake in AIL.

Rights of daughters | Supreme Court ruling a wake-up call to family businesses

“On behalf of my mother, sister and me, I can hereby confirm that following careful and thorough deliberation and in consultation with our independent advisors, we have decided to seek legal remedies with respect to our ongoing efforts to settle my father’s will,” she said in a statement.

“It was a big step for us and a very unfortunate one, as we have worked tirelessly over the course of the last three years to bring about an amicable settlement of my father’s interests in AIL. With the family voting unanimously to reject my appointment to the AIL board, we have seemingly reached the end of the road for an amicable settlement,” Dr. Arunachalam added.

She also noted that a “leave no stone unturned” approach had been adopted by her in an effort to bring about an amicable settlement.

“Given how the Murugappa family has treated our family branch over the past three years, we have no confidence that our substantial stake in the family business will be safeguarded by them. Perhaps most confounding to us is that the Murugappa family has attempted to project their stand as principled and righteous,” Dr. Arunachalam, Karta of MV Murugappan HUF, said.

“We recognize that our efforts have broader implications, especially with respect to gender equality – which is crucial for India to realize its full economic potential and social parity. We have complete faith in the judiciary and are emboldened by some of the recent decisions. We are confident that justice will prevail,” she added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ujj1z4/article32801063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDVALLIARUNACHALAM,https://www.thehindu.com/business/valli-arunachalam-serves-legal-notice-to-ambadi-investments-murugappa-family-members/article32801064.ece
51,2020/10/08,PFRDA allows video-based customer identification process for NPS subscribers,"The regulator has been constantly introducing new methods of subscriber authentication

Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) on Wednesday said it has allowed video-based customer identification process to further facilitate on-boarding, withdrawals and exit for NPS subscribers.

The regulator has been constantly introducing new methods of subscriber authentication such as OTP/ eSign based onboarding, offline Aadhaar-based on-boarding, third party reliance for KYC, e-nomination, e-exit for eNPS subscribers to make subscriber registration, exit process and processing other service requests seamless and subscriber friendly, according to a release.

While a lot of NPS (National Pension System) services have been moved online, including onboarding of new subscribers and their servicing, the physical presence of NPS subscribers is required at POPs (Points of Presence) for In-Person Verification (IPV) to complete the process of exit and some other allied services.

Compulsory physical presence is posing challenges for subscribers as well as PoPs/ nodal officers which lead to subscriber’s grievances and delays the process of withdrawal and exit, as per the release.

“To overcome the above challenges and in the interest of NPS subscribers, PFRDA has now permitted its intermediaries to use of Video-based Customer Identification Process (VCIP), in addition to the existing options, in order to further facilitate on-boarding, withdrawals, exit and for processing of other related service requests of NPS subscribers,” the release said.

Intermediaries which are solely registered and regulated by PFRDA will follow the guidelines issued by the authority for performing VCIP.

PFRDA said the Central Record Keeping Agencies (CRAs) and PoPs registered with it have been advised to build an online platform for the same at the earliest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/r0gsjh/article32364399.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th13BUPENSIONER,https://www.thehindu.com/business/pfrda-allows-video-based-customer-identification-process-for-nps-subscribers/article32800298.ece

53,2020/10/08,Ram Vilas Paswan obituary | Dalit leader who wore many a hat,"He was a socialist and liberal known for being part of many political alliances.

It was a simple question posed by his friend, “Do you want to be the government or servant?” that led socialist leader Ram Vilas Paswan into politics. In the half century that he spent in the profession, he came to be known as the weather vane of Indian politics, serving in the Cabinets of six Prime Ministers of all hues, from the United Front government of H.D. Deve Gowda to the BJP-led government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

It was 1968. Ram Vilas Paswan, then a 22-year-old, had secured the position of Deputy Superintendent of Police in Bihar, a huge leap for the son of a Dalit farmer, brought up in flood-prone Shaharbannii village, now known as mantri tola thanks to its famous resident, in Khagaria district of Bihar. Should he take the unpredictable life of a legislator or return to being a “Dy.SP”, was the question.

Also Read Ram Vilas Paswan passes away

His friend Lakshmi Narain Arya said, “Yeh toh aapke upar nirbhar karta hai, aap government ban-na chate hai ya servant ban-na chahte hai.” He never joined the police.

It has been a roller coaster ride for Mr. Paswan from the heartland of Bihar to 12 Janpath, sharing the boundary wall with one of the most famous political addresses of the country, UPA president Sonia Gandhi’s residence at 10 Janpath.

He was in equal measure a participant and a spectator in the Lutyens power matrix. And he wore many hats — a Dalit leader, a socialist, a liberal and also a political opportunist.

There was no turning back for him after being elected MLA in 1969 from the Samyukta Socialist Party. It is difficult to believe that till he fought his first election, he had no brush with politicians and had not attended a single political rally. It was more of a dare to defeat Congress old-timer Mishri Sadda who had been winning the Alauli seat since 1952.

Long record

In the 42 years since, he had been elected to the Lok Sabha eight times barring in 2009. And this year, he returned to Parliament once again for a second stint in the Rajya Sabha.

In 1975, when the Emergency was proclaimed, he was arrested and spent the entire period in jail. On being released in 1977, he became a member of the Janata Party and won the election to the Lok Sabha for the first time on its ticket. He held the world record for winning the election by the highest margin.

In 1989, he first became a Minister handling the Labour portfolio in the V.P. Singh government. His favourite stint was as Railway Minister in 1996 under Mr. Deve Gowda’s leadership. He was also part of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, in which he was unceremoniously removed as Communications Minister, an announcement, he often said, that he first heard on TV.

In 2000, Mr. Paswan broke from the Janata Dal to form the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) building up on the Dalit sena that he had formed in 1983. In 2002, after the Godhra riots, he quit the NDA. For a while, he drifted in the political wilderness which lifted when Congress president Sonia Gandhi, a neighbour of many years, walked across to his house to convince him to join the UPA. In the February 2005 Bihar Assembly elections, Mr. Paswan’s LJP contested the election with the Congress. The results threw up a hung Assembly. The LJP won 29 seats, its highest tally ever in the State. However, Mr. Paswan refused to support either Nitish Kumar or Lalu Prasad. Instead he insisted that a Muslim be made the Chief Minister. The State went to the polls again and Nitish Kumar won.

In 2014, it was his son Chirag Paswan who steered him towards the BJP, a party that he had publicly recoiled from. He was the oldest of three brothers and one sister. He is often called a dynast. He brought his brothers Pashupati Nath Paras and late Ramchandra Paswan into politics. Of the six seats that the LJP won in 2019, three are from his family — Chirag, brother Pashupati Kumar Paras and nephew Prince Raj.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/x0f02w/article32807108.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08RAMVILASPASWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ram-vilas-paswan-obituary-dalit-leader-who-wore-many-a-hat/article32807109.ece

55,2020/10/08,"Indian media is free, says in MEA response to Chinese Embassy’s note to press on Taiwan","The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Thursday reiterated that the Indian media is free and it reports on issues on merit. The Ministry spokesperson’s response came a day after the Chinese Embassy sent an email to around 250 journalists asking them not to refer to Taiwan as a “country” or a “nation” while covering a special event on October 10 to be organised by the Taipei Economy and Cultural Centre (TECC) in India.

“There is a free media in India, that reports on issues that they see fit,” said Anurag Srivastava of the Ministry of External Affairs in response to a question during the weekly online media interaction.

The MEA response came a day after the note to the Indian media urged them to follow the “One China principle” with regard to the upcoming celebration of the “109th” anniversary of the “national” day of Taiwan.

The Chinese Embassy reminded the Indian media that Beijing does not recognise Taiwan as an independent country or a nation and the Indian media should follow that while reporting on the Taiwanese event.

“We hope Indian media can stick to Indian government’s position on Taiwan question and do not violate the One-China principle,” the Chinese statement had said.

India has officially followed the “One-China principle” and there has been no change in that stance. . The TECC does not have a diplomatic status here as India does not recognise Taiwan as a separate entity.

The Chinese statement drew widespread response on social media. Comments poured in from Taiwan, including from persons in Taipei. A social media post from Taiwan's “foreign ministry” hit out at the Chinese Embassy and accused Beijing of attempting to impose restrictions on Indian media.

However, the Embassy spokesperson reiterated Beijing's position on Thursday and said, “There is only one China in the world. Taiwan is inalienable part of China's territory. One-China policy is international universal consensus and long-standing position of Indian government, which China appreciates. It is wishful thinking to seek any “Taiwan independence”.”.

The exchanges took place hours after External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar participated in the Quad ministerial meeting with counterparts from Australia, Japan and the United States in Tokyo where all sides reiterated common commitment to uphold a free and inclusive Asia-Pacific region of which the Taiwan Strait forms an important part.

The issues related to the Asia-Pacific region are expected to feature in the 2+2 dialogue between Dr. Jaishankar.

A Division Bench of Justices Prakash Padia and Pritinker Diwaker on Thursday noted that State government had already been directed to file affidavits clarifying its stand in the entire case by the Supreme Court.

“In the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, judicial propriety demands that it will not be proper for this Court to entertain the present petition on merits, especially when security has been provided to petitioners 1 to 6 and other family members of the deceased victim-girl on the observation made by the apex court,” said the HC. Similar directions had already been issued by the Lucknow Bench of the HC in a suo motu petition on October 1, the court added.

If the petitioners have any grievance, they are at liberty to file appropriate petition or application before the apex court, the HC said.

In a letter to SP Hathras, the accused Sandeep Singh claimed he and three others were falsely implicated in the case by the family of the victim.

The letter, also widely circulated on social media on Thursday, has thumb impressions of all four accused, the other three being Ravi, Lavkush and Ramu.

In the letter, Sandeep claims that he was acquainted with the victim and the two would speak on phone but the girl’s family did not approve of their friendship.

He also goes on to claim that on the day of the incident, he had met the victim in the fields and that she was accompanied by her brother and mother. Sandeep further claims through hearsay information that after he left the spot on the girl’s request, the girl’s brother and mother beat her up.

Alok Singh, Senior Superintendent, Aligarh Jail confirmed that Sandeep Singh had sent a letter to the SP Mathura. Officer Singh said he forwarded the letter to SP Hathras as per the rules.

Reacting to the letter, a female relative of the victim told a television channel that she sensed “plans” being played out to protect the four accused. “Stories are being pitched to save them. Everything is theirs, the ministers and the MPs are theirs. Who do we have? Poor people don't have anyone except for God,” the woman said.

The family of the victim had filed a habeas corpus petition in the HC against their alleged illegal detention. The writ was moved by Surendra Kumar, the general secretary of the Akhil Bharatiya Valmiki Mahapanchayat on behalf of the family, through advocates Kashif Abbas Rizvi and Joun Abbas.

The petition also prayed for directing the administration to allow the family — the victim’s parents, two brothers, sister-in-law and grandmother — to move to Delhi as per their free will.

The petitioners alleged that that they were being restrained from exercising their fundamental right to free movement, and have been confined at their home. They also said they have been “prevented from meeting or communicating freely, thereby violating their Fundamental Right to freedom of speech and expression as well as the right to receive information”.

The State government counsel objected to the petition on several counts, prime among them that the matter was already sub-judice before the Supreme Court, hence the plea before the HC was not maintainable.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, without any specific reference, took to Twitter saying that the woman deserved “justice not slander”.

In a sign of India’s increased engagement with the ongoing Intra-Afghan Dialogue, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a meeting with Chairman of Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation (HCNR) Abdullah Abdullah, who is here on a 5-day visit. During the talks, Mr. Abdullah briefed the Prime Minister on the deliberations in Doha between the Afghan government and civil society representatives with Taliban representatives.

Comment | Another Afghan peace push and a role for India

“Prime Minister Modi reiterated India’s commitment towards sustainable peace and prosperity in Afghanistan and welcomed efforts towards a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Afghanistan,” said a statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).

Mr. Abdullah, who met National Security Advisor Ajit Doval over dinner on Wednesday, will meet External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Friday, it said.

Addressing diplomats and scholars at an address organised by the Manohar Parrikar Institute of Defence and Strategic Analysis (MPIDSA), Mr. Abdullah said he had been “energised and re-energised” by India’s support to the people of Afghanistan “achieving a dignified durable and sustainable peace”. He expressed gratitude for the $3billion aid India has disbursed for projects across Afghanistan since 2001.

Islamabad visit

When asked about his visit to Islamabad last week and whether India-Pakistan tensions would affect his mission for “regional consensus” for the IAN (Intra Afghan Negotiations), he said that Afghans would pursue their own “national interest”.

“We need better relations with all countries. It is not our policy to decide the policies that other countries pursue towards each other, but we believe that peace in Afghanistan is in everyone’s interest,” he said, adding that Mr. Modi had assured him that India would support any peace agreement that was agreeable to the people of Afghanistan.

The MEA also said that Mr. Doval discussed “increased levels of violence across Afghanistan” and peace and security in the region when he called on Mr. Abdullah.

Comment | The sum and substance of the Afghan deal

While the delegation from Kabul has been hopeful of a declaration of a permanent ceasefire with the beginning of talks last month, the Taliban has refused to agree to one thus far. According to US agency SIGAR (Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction), civilian casualties in Afghanistan had increased nearly 60% between April-June 2020 over the previous quarter, despite the U.S.-Taliban accord being signed in February.

More engagement with Kabul

With two new officials, including Joint Secretary (Pakistan-Afghanistan-India) J.P. Singh and new Ambassador in Kabul Rudrendra Tandon being appointed within the MEA, New Delhi is signalling an uptick in its engagement with Afghanistan. Last month, Mr. Jaishankar addressed the inauguration of the Intra-Afghan talks, and sent a team to Doha, the first time an Indian official has addressed a gathering that includes the Taliban. Mr. Jaishankar also met with former Afghanistan Vice-President Rashid Dostum in September, in a sign that the government is reaching out to other parts of the Afghan leadership.

A stalwart of the socialist movement, who later emerged as Bihar’s foremost Dalit leader with a following across the country, Mr. Paswan was instrumental in the implementation of the Mandal Commission report in the 1990s.

“I am saddened beyond words. There is a void in our nation that will perhaps never be filled. Shri Ram Vilas Paswan ji’s demise is a personal loss. I have lost a friend, valued colleague and someone who was extremely passionate to ensure every poor person leads a life of dignity,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.

“My deepest condolences on the passing away of Shri Ram Vilas Paswan.

The TRP or Target Rating Point is the metric used by the marketing and advertising agencies to evaluate this viewership. In India, the TRP is recorded by the Broadcast Audience Research Council using Bar-O-Meters that are installed in televisions in selected households. As on date, the BARC has installed these meters in 44,000 households across the country. Audio watermarks are embedded in video content prior to broadcast. These watermarks are not audible to the human ear, but can easily be detected and decoded using dedicated hardware and software. As viewing details are recorded by the Bar-O-Meters, so are the watermarks.

How are the households selected?

Selection of households where Bar-O-Meters are installed is a two-stage process. The first step is the Establishment Survey, a large-scale face-to-face survey of a sample of approximately 3 lakh households from the target population. This is done annually. Out of these, the households which will have Bar-O-Meters or what the BARC calls the Recruitment Sample are randomly selected. The fieldwork to recruit households is not done directly by BARC. The BARC on its website has said that the viewing behaviour of panel homes is reported to BARC India daily. Coincidental checks either physically or telephonically are done regularly. Certain suspicious outliers are also checked directly by BARC India. “BARC India also involves a separate vigilance agency to check on outliers that it considers highly suspicious,” the website says. And as per the guidelines of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, these households rotate every year. This rotation is in such a manner that older panel homes are removed first while maintaining the representativeness of the panel. The rotation is conducted in a staggered manner by rotating panel homes every month. The Ministry guidelines further say that the secrecy and privacy of the panel homes must be maintained, and asked the BARC to follow a voluntary code of conduct.

What are the loopholes in the process?

The Mumbai police claimed that households were being paid to manipulate the TRP.

“As in all our previous cases of suspected panel homes intrusions, BARC India continues to follow its established vigilance and disciplinary guidelines. BARC remains steadfastly true to its purpose to accurately and faithfully report ‘What India Watches’. BARC India appreciates the efforts of the Mumbai Police and will provide the support asked of it,” the BARC India spokesperson said.

Several doubts have been raised on many previous occasions about the working of the TRP. On Wednesday, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar had said that the TRP process needs a rethink and attacked what he called “TRP Journalism”. Speaking at an event organised by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh newsletter Panchajanya, Mr. Javadekar said, “Because we believe in self-regulation, I urge media companies to work out a way for regulating their content. The government has faith in the media and the freedom of the press, but the media should work out a way to ensure how its freedom is ensured.” Public broadcaster Doordarshan has time and again said that TRP did not reflect the actual viewership.

As per several reports, about 70% of the revenue for television channels comes from advertising and only 30% from subscription. Many channels have argued that the subscription rates, which are controlled by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), should be raised so that TV channels are not forced to serve the lowest common denominator.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/61dz64/article32805846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-TRP-Media,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-trp-and-its-loopholes/article32805873.ece
60,2020/10/08,"Congress flags ₹12,000 cr loss from illegal iron ore exports","Private mining firms have evaded duty since 2014 changes to policy

Private mining companies have defrauded the Union government of ₹12,000 crore by evading export duty via “illegal export” of iron ore since 2014, the Congress alleged on Thursday and demanded an inquiry into what it described as a “Modi-made iron ore scam”.

Addressing a press conference, party spokesperson Pawan Khera said a Law Ministry note of September 10 pointed out that only Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Limited (KIOCL), a flagship company under Ministry of Steel, was allowed to export iron ore. But in the past six years several private mining companies were also engaged in illegal export of iron ore pellets.

Law Ministry note

The party also circulated copies of the Law Ministry note to highlight the fact the issue has been flagged within the government.

The Congress spokesperson claimed that the illegal export of iron ore pellets started after the Modi government made changes to the iron ore export policy in 2014 and allowed the export of high quality iron ore and waived off 30 % duty on export of pellets.

“It is estimated that these private firms have exported iron ore worth ₹40,000 crore since 2014, violating the law as they did not have the license to export the ore. However, these private players, as expected, have not been reprimanded or questioned by the Central Government and continue to flourish by exporting iron ore pellets,” Mr. Khera alleged.

“Even private firms that had iron ore mines for personal consumption started exporting iron ore pellets by seeing this opportunity and in collusion with Ministry officials... By not paying the export duty, the private players have robbed the government of around ₹12,000 crore in duty fee. Under the Foreign Trade Development and Regulation Act 1992, these private players are liable to a penalty of ₹2,00,000 crore for this gross illegality ,” he added.

Demanding that a detailed list of firms exporting iron ore illegally be made public, the Congress asked, “Since 2014 has the government questioned any private entity regarding their illegal dealings vis-a-vis iron ore export? What action has been initiated, if any against the officials of the Steel Ministry who allowed illegal export to take place.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/n2h9xv/article32215335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KHERAKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cong-flags-12000-cr-loss-from-illegal-iron-ore-exports/article32804895.ece
61,2020/10/08,Senior Cong. leaders slam changes to defence acquisition policy,"Dropping offset clauses, privatisation of OFB will hurt security preparations, says statement

Senior Congress leaders have termed the new defence Acquisition policy deeply disturbing, warning that it will compromise national security interests and have long term implications for the country’s defence preparedness.

The joint statement was issued by Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, deputy leader of Congress in Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma, Rajya Sabha MPs Kapil Sibal and Vivek Tankha, and Lok Sabha MPs Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor.

As part of the next step, the leaders will plan to move the Supreme Court against the new policy, sources said.

The six law makers, incidentally, were also signatories of the letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi in August that flagged the need for systemic changes in the working of the party. The leaders, however, maintained that the statement on defence acquisition has been issued in their capacities as parliamentarians.

Caught up in the agitation against the new farm laws and the Hathras gangrape incident, the Congress is yet to formally react on the statement.

IGA clauses

In recent changes, the Defence Ministry has removed the offset clause requirement in Inter-Governmental Agreements (IGA) in the new Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAC) 2020 issued on September 28. Under the offset clause, foreign companies are required to invest part of their deal value in the country and to improve the domestic defence manufacturing.

Also read: Defence Ministry strengthens its new procurement policy

The statement said the proposed privatisation of the 41 Ordinance Factories, changes in the FDI Policy and diluting the Defence Offsets Policy including dispensing with the condition of transfer of technology in acquisition of weapons and equipment for the armed forces, are deeply disturbing.

“These decisions compromise national security interests and will have long term implications for India’s defence preparedness and in becoming a self-reliant nation. Decisions are also in conflict with the Government’s Make in India campaign and Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission,” the leaders said.

Also read: Draft Defence Production & Export Promotion Policy issued

Stating that these changes are unwarranted, the Congress leaders said, the offset policy and transfer of technology have been an integral part of the defence acquisition policy. “Accessing, acquiring and assimilating high end technologies for domestic production of weapon platforms and systems has been and must remain a national priority to reduce India’s dependence on defence imports,” they added.

Long term investments

41 ordinance factories across India are on a month long strike against this decision. “The OFB is accountable to the people of the country through Parliament and also to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). The ordinance factories are subjected to periodical review by the Defence Ministry and the Parliamentary standing committee as well. The government must explain in what way the OFB has failed in transparency and accountability in a democratic system with checks and balances,” the statement said.

The Ordinance Factories have huge infrastructure, production capacities and real estate at strategic locations across the country, the leaders said, adding that these valuable national assets must not be squandered away.

“What is needed today is an infusion of technology, manpower training and acquisition orders by the armed forces. Handing over the factories and assets to the private sector is bereft of any justification and against India’s national interest,” the leaders said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bbn7s1/article32804494.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AZAD-ANAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/senior-cong-leaders-slam-changes-to-defence-acquisition-policy/article32804495.ece
62,2020/10/08,NHRC issues advisory to govt. on women’s rights during pandemic,"Recommendations include setting up task force on gender-based violence, free contraception, moratoriums on loans taken by women workers

Setting up a task force on gender-based violence to coordinate and monitor support and prevention services, providing free contraception and giving moratoriums for all loans taken by women workers were some of the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in its advisory to the government on Wednesday on protecting women’s rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a statement on Thursday, the NHRC said it had formed a committee of experts to look into the impact of the pandemic on human rights, which had led to advisories on various issues, including women’s rights. The NHRC statement said the Centre and State governments were asked to implement the recommendations and submit action taken reports.

Citing the National Commission for Women’s finding that domestic violence cases had increased two-and-half-times from February to May, the NHRC recommended a “coordinated and inter-ministerial health system response” to gender-based violence and a task force to ensure implementation of related laws.

The advisory, which was sent to various Central Ministries, including the Women and Child Development, Health and Family Welfare and Home Affairs Ministries, and all States and Union Territories, included recommendations on sexual and reproductive rights.

“Make provisions for free contraceptives and other essential materials for safe delivery and safe abortion at public health facilities,” the advisory said.

The NHRC recommended extending the moratorium on loan repayment, including for self-help groups and MUDRA loans.

“Moratorium may be given on all loans taken by women workers, including sex workers, from banks and other financial institutions. In case of harassment by lenders, due cognizance and appropriate action by concerned authorities may be taken,” the advisory stated.

The NHRC advisory said State governments may provide assistance to sex workers and that they should be recognised as informal workers to be able to access welfare measures.

On the Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA), anganwadi and sanitation workers, the advisory said the remuneration should comply with minimum wage standards and overtime work should be compensated.

For women from Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and minority communities, the advisory said essential healthcare services, COVID-19-related or not, should be uninterrupted. The advisory said the government should notify sanitary napkins and iron folic acid supplements as essential items and ensure continuous supply through the Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls and Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram. The advisory also said that all pregnant women prisoners should be released and for those inside jails, better washrooms and gender-sensitive health services should be provided.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xx9g32/article32804390.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NHRC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nhrc-issues-advisory-to-govt-on-womens-rights-during-pandemic/article32804391.ece

67,2020/10/08,Former CBI director Ashwani Kumar cremated,"Authorities at a Shimla hospital preserved a viscera sample for a final medical report.

Former CBI director Ashwani Kumar was cremated in the presence of his family, friends and senior Himachal Pradesh officials and politicians here on Thursday, a day after he was found hanging at his home.

The 69-year-old, who also served as Nagaland governor and led the investigation into the Aarushi Talwar murder case, left behind a note saying he was embarking on a new journey, officials said.

The pyre was lit by his son Abhishek. Senior state politicians, including Power Minister Sukh Ram Chaudhary and Leader of Opposition Mukesh Agnihotri, and Director General of Police Sanjay Kundu were among those present on the occasion.

In Delhi, the CBI held a condolence meeting for Kumar, who loved Tom and Jerry and, in fact, likened his work to the cat and mouse games that made the cartoon show a hit for generations of children and adults too.

The 1973-batch IPS officer is survived by his wife and son.

On Thursday, after the mandatory medical examination of the body, authorities at a city hospital preserved a viscera sample for a final medical report and then handed his mortal remains to the family for the last rites, officials said.

A preliminary probe indicates that a sudden change in his active life over the last six months — India went into lockdown in March to curb the spread of COVID-19 — could be a probable reason behind the drastic move but police are looking into all probabilities, they said.

“We recovered a suicide note in which he had written he is embarking on a new journey. His family members were present when he went inside the room, locked it and committed suicide by hanging himself with a nylon rope. The family does not suspect any foul play. We have seized the items in the room,” DGP Kundu told PTI on Wednesday night.

A few hours earlier, on Wednesday evening, Kumar was found hanging at his residence in Brockhurst near Chhota Shimla.

The DGP was personally monitoring the case along with Shimla Superintendent of Police (SP) Mohit Chawla and other senior police officials, including the forensic team.

Former colleagues and present officers of the agency remembered Kumar as a soft-spoken gentleman with a ready smile.

A resident of Nahan in the state, Kumar became director of the Central Bureau of Investigation in 2008, succeeding Vijay Shanker. Kumar was a surprise announcement for the post. Two other names, both senior to him, were doing the rounds for the top job. This was also the time when the agency was grappling with controversies surrounding the Aarushi murder case.

“I like Tom and Jerry Police is like the cat while the criminals are mice. So Tom never leaves Jerry,” Kumar had said in an interview to PTI in 2008 after taking over as CBI director.

“I am in the game of Tom and Jerry and I have to do my job,” he said.

Kumar had expressed his displeasure over the probe into the twin murders of Noida schoolgirl Aarushi Talwar, the daughter of dentist couple Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, and the family’s domestic help Hemraj.

The sensational twin murders had the nation agog and Kumar had taken it upon himself to take the investigation to a logical conclusion.

“This case is a litmus test for me. I need to know who killed Aarushi — parents or someone else. I feel agitated over this case,” he had said.

A closure report was prepared during his tenure as CBI chief. This later formed the basis of the arrests and conviction of Aarushi’s parents. Both the parents are now out on bail and the case is being heard in higher courts.

A resident of Nahan in Himachal Pradesh, Kumar became director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2008, succeeding Vijay Shanker in the midst of the agency’s probe into the Aarushi Talwar murder case, which was hogging media headlines.

He had also served in the Special Protection Group elite force, which primarily guards the prime minister, and was appointed as the governor of Nagaland in 2013 by the UPA government.

The Union government on Thursday launched a public awareness drive as part of its fight against coronavirus (COVID-19), with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Ministerial colleagues asking people to follow precautions such as wearing masks and maintaining social-distancing norms to defeat the coronavirus pandemic.

The start of a ‘jan andolan’ (mass movement) campaign comes in view of upcoming festivals, winter season and opening up of the economy, as a lack of adherence to recommended precautions can increase cases of the infection. Mr. Modi said India’s coronavirus fight is people-driven and gets great strength from its COVID warriors. He also urged the masses to unite to fight the virus.

“Let us #Unite2FightCorona! Let us always remember: Wear a mask. Wash hands. Follow social distancing. Practice ‘Do Gaj Ki Doori.’ Together, we will succeed. Together, we will win against COVID-19,” he said in another tweet.

Mr. Modi appealed to people to follow social-distancing norms and expressed confidence that the fight against the pandemic will be won. “Collective efforts have helped save many lives,” the Prime Minister said.

69,2020/10/08,NIA arrests two for alleged ISIS affiliation,"Accused raised funds to ‘radicalise and motivate Muslim youth of Bengaluru’ to join banned terror outfit

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested a business analyst at a Chennai bank and a rice merchant from Bengaluru for their alleged affiliation to Islamic State and for entering into a conspiracy “to radicalize and motivate Muslim youth of Bengaluru” to join the banned terror outfit.

The NIA claimed that the accused had raised funds to facilitate the travel of young men from Bengaluru to Syria in 2013-14. At least two from Bengaluru were killed in Syria, the NIA said. The agency did not disclose the identity of those killed.

The accused have been identified as Ahamed Abdul Cader, 40, and Irfan Nasir, 33. The NIA said that Cader is a business analyst at a bank in Chennai, and Nasir is a rice merchant in Bengaluru.

The case was registered suo motu by the NIA on September 19, after certain incriminating facts emerged about a Bengaluru-based ISIS module during the investigation of another case where a Bengaluru-based ophthalmologist Abdur Rahman was arrested. During Rahman’s examination, names of other associates who had travelled to Syria in 2013-2014 to join the ISIS came to be known.

“Further investigation resulted in the busting of a module wherein it was revealed that accused Ahamed Abdul Cader, Irfan Nasir and their associates were members of the Hizb-ut-Tehrir, and they had formed a group called ‘Quran Circle’ which radicalized gullible Muslim youth in Bengaluru and funded their visit to conflict zone in Syria to aid and assist the ISIS terrorists,” NIA said in a statement.

Based on the information, the NIA registered a case under Sections 120B and 125 of IPC, and Sections 17, 18 and 18B of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against the accused for affiliation with the banned terrorist organization ISIS/ISIL/Daesh and for “entering into a conspiracy to radicalize and motivate Muslim youth of Bengaluru to join ISIS and for raising funds to facilitate their travel to Syria”.

The NIA said the accused and their associates played a very significant role in radicalisation of the members of the group and arranged funds through donations and their own sources for the visit of Rahman and others from Bengaluru to Syria to join the ISIS.

The NIA said searches were conducted at the premises of the accused, and incriminating material and electronic devices had been seized.

The accused were produced before Special NIA Court in Bengaluru and NIA custody for 10 days has been granted for interrogation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hsffn0/article32803450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIAJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nia-arrests-two-for-alleged-isis-affiliation/article32803337.ece

71,2020/10/08,UNSC should not be misused with ‘retaliatory intent’ to name innocent civilians as terrorists: India,"The United Nations Security Council should not be misused by countries with “retaliatory intent to name innocent civilians as terrorist” without credible evidence by invoking non-transparent working methods and procedures, India has said, referring to Pakistan’s failed attempt to get four Indian nationals listed under the 1267 Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee.

Pakistan had submitted the names of Indian nationals Angara Appaji, Gobinda Patnaik, Ajoy Mistry and Venumadhav Dongara for designation under the 1267 Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee of the U.N. Security Council.

However, Pakistan’s attempt was thwarted last month after the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany and Belgium blocked the move in the Council to list Appaji and Patnaik. According to sources, no evidence was given by Pakistan in its case to get the individuals listed. Similarly, an earlier attempt by Pakistan to list Mistry and Dongara was blocked by the Council around June/July.

“We believe that U.N. Security Council continues to be an effective forum for the maintenance of international peace and security and combating terrorism.

“However, it should also be ensured that the forum is not misused by countries with retaliatory intent to name innocent civilians as terrorist without credible evidence by invoking non-transparent working methods and procedures,” First Secretary and Legal Adviser in India’s Permanent Mission to the U.N. Yedla Umasankar said on October 6 at the 6th Committee of the U.N. General Assembly on ‘Measures to eliminate international terrorism’.

Without naming Pakistan, he said, “India has been and continues to be a victim of terrorism sponsored across our borders. We have had first-hand experience of the cruel link between transnational organised crime and terrorism.” Mr. Umashankar said India condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and no cause whatsoever or grievance can justify terrorism, including state-sponsored cross-border terrorism.

“Our fight against terrorism should not only seek to eliminate terrorists and disrupt terror organisations/networks, but should also identify/hold accountable and take strong measures against states that encourage, support and finance terrorism, provide sanctuary to terrorists and terror groups,” he said.

Mr. Umasankar said the fight against terrorism has to be unrelenting and across all fronts and the flow of resources to terror linked entities needs to be completely stopped by collective inter-state efforts.

The international community cannot and should not be selective in dealing with the terrorists groups or in dismantling terror infrastructure. India strongly condemns direct or indirect financial assistance provided by some States to terrorist groups and/or individuals members thereof, he said.

India also called on the need to work together to expose and destroy the linkages that exist between terrorists and their supporters.

Also read: India to protest Pakistan claims on terror at U.N.

“We need an international mechanism to ensure accountability and justice, enhanced dialogue and broaden understanding amongst member states,” Mr. Umasankar said.

While the threat emanating from international terrorism is looming large, the inability of the U.N. to agree on a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism remains one of the most “glaring shortcomings” in the international legislative framework, which could have boosted enforcement efforts to destroy safe havens of terrorists, their financial flows and their support networks, he noted.

Mr. Umasankar also underscored the importance and need for early finalisation and conclusion of the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT), which will reflect the international community’s commitment to cooperate in combating terrorism.

He said with advancement in technology and an over flowing cyber world, terrorists are gaining access to infinite resources of “do it yourself” kits on issues ranging from making bombs to executing, beheadings besides securing communications and flow of funds.

The proponents and perpetrators of these nefarious acts cleverly adopt emerging technologies for furthering their ideologies and accomplishing their evil acts, Mr. Umasankar said.

Asserting that the only effective way to tackle terrorism is by way of concerted international cooperation and genuine collaboration among the States, Mr. Umasankar said combined international efforts by way of extradition, prosecution, information exchange and capacity building go a long way in countering the menace of terrorism which is threatening the global community.

Mr. Umasankar said normative efforts at the United Nations need to be coordinated through collaboration with other fora like Financial Action Task Force (FATF). He said the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy (GCTS) being discussed by the U.N. General Assembly over the last decade has resulted in little impact on the ground.

He also stressed that while making every effort to combat terrorism, the U.N. and its member states should consider the rights of victims of terrorism and obligation of states towards the victims of terrorism under international law.

A vast majority of victims of terrorism are often women and children. It’s high time for us to try and strengthen efforts to achieve the objective of putting in place a global legal framework in the form of CCIT to counter a global scourge. This will provide a legal basis for global fight against terrorism as all member states will have a multilateral platform to counter terrorism, Mr. Umasankar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vu4tjm/article32803280.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Yedla-Umasankar-twitter,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/unsc-should-not-be-misused-with-retaliatory-intent-to-name-innocent-civilians-as-terrorists-india/article32803281.ece
72,2020/10/08,Head of Afghan peace council Abdullah Abdullah meets PM Modi,"Anurag Srivastava said Mr. Modi reaffirmed India’s long term commitment to further deepen ties with Afghanistan.

Afghanistan’s top peace negotiator Abdullah Abdullah on Thursday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and discussed the ongoing peace initiative to bring back stability in the war-ravaged country.

Following the meeting, Mr. Abdullah tweeted that Mr. Modi assured him of India’s continued support for the peace process in Afghanistan.

External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said Mr. Modi reaffirmed India’s long term commitment to further deepen ties with Afghanistan.

Mr. Abdullah arrived here on Tuesday on a five-day visit as part of the efforts to build a regional consensus and support for the Afghan peace process.

“Pleased to meet HE Narendra Modi @narendramodi, the Prime Minister of Republic of #India. In our friendly discussion we took stock of the latest developments on the #AfghanPeaceProcess, the talks in Doha, & India’s support for the peace efforts,” Mr. Abdullah said on Twitter.

“HE PM assured me of India’s continued support for the peace process, & Afghanistan. I thanked him & the people of India for the invitation, & generous hospitality. I also thanked India for its principled position on the #AfghanPeaceProcess,” he said.

On Wednesday, Mr. Abdullah, the head of Afghan peace council, held extensive talks with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.

The visit of the influential Afghan leader to India comes in the midst of peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Doha.

The Taliban and the Afghan government are holding direct talks to end 19 years of war that has killed tens of thousands of people and ravaged various parts of the country.

India has been a major stakeholder in the peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested USD two billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country.

India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.

On September 12, an Indian delegation attended the inaugural ceremony of the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha while External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar joined it through video conference.

India has been keenly following the evolving political situation after the US signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February. The deal provided for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, effectively drawing curtains to Washington’s 18-year war in the country.

The US has lost over 2,400 soldiers in Afghanistan since late 2001.

India has also been maintaining that care should be taken to ensure that any such process does not lead to any “ungoverned spaces” where terrorists and their proxies can relocate.

India has been calling upon all sections of the political spectrum in Afghanistan to work together to meet the aspirations of all people in that country including those from the minority community for a prosperous and safe future.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mrvme5/article32801551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI08-10-2020000056B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/head-of-afghan-peace-council-abdullah-abdullah-meets-pm-modi/article32801552.ece
73,2020/10/08,Supreme Court slams Centre on Tablighi affidavit,"‘We find it extremely evasive and brazenly short of details’, says CJI

Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde on Thursday pulled up the Union government for mistreating the Supreme Court for having a “junior officer” file an “evasive” affidavit containing “unnecessary, nonsensical” averments on petitions challenging the discriminatory and communal coverage of the Tablighi Jamaat incident by some sections of the media.

“You cannot treat the court the way you are doing in this case... A junior officer has filed your affidavit. We find it extremely evasive and brazenly short of details. It even says the petitioners here do not point to any instance of bad reporting... “Chief Justice Bobde addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.

Fresh affidavit

Mr. Mehta promised to file a fresh affidavit.

“We want the Secretary of the department [Information and Broadcasting] to file this affidavit... The Secretary has to say what he thinks of the incidents. We do not want any unnecessary, nonsensical averments like those made now”, the CJI said.

Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for petitioners led by Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, said the present government affidavit even accused the petitioners of trying to gag the freedom of speech.

“Freedom of speech may be one of the most abused freedom in recent times”, Chief Justice Bobde, heading a three-judge Bench comprising Justices A S. Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanium, replied.

Also Read | Explained: Who are the Tablighi Jamaat?

The government affidavit had claimed that a “blanket gag order” on the media in this issue would violate a journalist’s right to free speech and an informed citizen’s right to know.

The hearing began with Chief Justice Bobde asking whether the regulatory provisions of the Cable TV Act, which are meant for cable networks, would be “exercisable” on TV broadcasts. “We want to know if the government has any power to question or ban TV broadcasting signals”, he asked the parties.

The CJI said regulatory bodies had issued advisories to the the TV channels.

Ban on broadcast

Mr. Dave argued that the Information and Broadcasting Ministry had indeed the power to ban TV broadcasting under the Cable TV Act.

He referred to how Malayalam channel Asianet was banned for several hours in March under the Act in relation to their coverage of the Delhi riots.

The court said it would hear arguments on this point and adjourned the case for two weeks.

The petitions have said that certain sections of the print and electronic media were spreading bigotry and communal hatred in relation to the Tablighi Jamaat conference held in the Nizamuddin Markaz area.

The Jamiat writ, filed through advocate Ejaz Maqbool, has sought a direction to the Ministry to identify and take strict action against sections of the media who are communalising the Nizamuddin Markaz issue.

The petition said the “unfortunate incident of the Tablighi Jamaat was used to demonise and blame the entire Muslim community”. Certain sections of the media, instead of exercising restraint, reported the incident with a communal flavour. This may perpetrate hatred, the petition contended.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6carul/article32765363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-slams-centre-on-tablighi-affidavit/article32801548.ece

ACM Bhadauria also presented distinguished service medal Yudh Seva Medial (YSM) to some of the personnel who took part in the Balakot air strike on February 26 last year and the aerial engagement a day later. These were announced in August last year.

78,2020/10/08,DGCA issues detailed refund guidelines after SC verdict,"The guidelines came six days after the Supreme Court directed that a full and immediate refund should be given to passengers for the air tickets cancelled between March 25 and May 24

Aviation regulator DGCA issued detailed guidelines on Wednesday regarding a refund of the ticket price for the flights cancelled amid the coronavirus-triggered lockdown.

The guidelines came six days after the Supreme Court directed that a full and immediate refund should be given to passengers for the air tickets cancelled between March 25 and May 24. No domestic passenger flights operated in the country in this period.

The top court had, on October 1, also passed directions about the refund and credit shell formation for the bookings and cancellations done during the other time periods around the lockdown.

Based on the court order, the DGCA categorised passengers in three categories -- those who booked tickets between March 25 and May 24 for travelling within the same period, those who booked tickets prior to March 25 but the travel period was till May 24, those who booked tickets anytime but for a journey post May 24.

The regulator said the passengers belonging to the first category must be given a full refund by the airline concerned for the tickets cancelled.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said the airlines should “make all endeavours” to refund the passengers belonging to the second category within 15 days.

“If on account of financial stress, any airline/airlines are not able to do so, they shall provide a credit shell equal to the amount of fare collected (to the passenger),” it added

The passengers can then use the credit shells to book any ticket by March 31, 2021, the DGCA noted.

Those belonging to the third category will be given a refund in accordance with the existing DGCA rules.

The Indian aviation industry has been hit hard due to the coronavirus pandemic and as a result, all airlines in the country have opted for cost-cutting measures such as layoffs, leave without pay for the employees etc.

Scheduled domestic passenger flight services resumed in the country after a gap of two months on May 25. Currently, airlines are permitted to operate only up to 60 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights.

Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in the country since March 23. However, special international passenger flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat mission since May and under air bubble arrangements formed with various countries since July.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/d3y4tc/article32330134.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ss-chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dgca-issues-detailed-refund-guidelines-after-sc-verdict/article32800344.ece

Also read: One year of Narendra Modi 2.0 | We will decide our present and future, PM tells nation

In a series of tweets in Hindi, Mr. Modi said he will continue to strive to make himself worthy of people’s blessings and love, as he conveyed his gratitude to them.

“I would like to assure the countrymen once again that the welfare of the nation and the poor is paramount for me and will always be so,” Mr. Modi said.

“No person can ever claim that he does not have any shortcomings. A long period of holding such important and responsible positions...being human, even I can make mistakes,” Mr. Modi said.

He said it is his good fortune that despite all these limitations, people’s love for him is growing.

Modi said the way people have showered blessings and love on him from every corner of the country today, the power of his words to thank them is falling short.

“Your blessings and love will strengthen our resolve of service to the country, welfare of the poor and taking India to new heights,” the Prime Minister said.

He said since childhood one thing that has been ingrained in him is that “janata-janardan (public)” are a form of God and in a democracy they are powerful like God.

“For such a long period, the responsibilities that have been entrusted to me by the countrymen, I have made authentic and dedicated efforts to fulfil them,” he said.

BJP leaders on Wednesday heaped praise on Modi and his leadership as he entered his 20th year without a break as the head of an elected government, including close to 13 years as Chief Minister of Gujarat.

Mr. Modi, who turned 70 last month, started as a volunteer of the RSS and then served in the BJP’s organisation for many years before the party leadership sent him to Gujarat, his home state, as its chief minister in 2001.

Since then, he has never tasted electoral defeat and led the BJP to power in the state three straight times before steering the party to its biggest, until then, Lok Sabha poll win in 2014 and then scripting an even bigger win in the 2019 general elections.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/c06eyp/article32289918.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PM-Modi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/welfare-of-nation-poor-is-paramount-for-me-pm-modi/article32799429.ece

Excess rainfall in Anantapur district during the four months of the south west monsoon led to inundation of 11 types of agriculture crops in 6,016.82 hectares spread over 43 mandals. The crop damage has affected 4,977 farmers.

According to Joint Director of Agriculture Ramakrishna, a ground-level survey conducted by the Department of Agriculture in the last one week showed that groundnut crop in 3927.15 hectares spread over 144 villages in 40 mandals was badly damaged and the department will recommend for compensation based on the percentage of loss.

While agreeing that the total yield would come down in groundnut, Mr. Ramakrishna said that excess rain in September did the maximum damage leading to the germination of pods. With regard to the groundnut crop, 3,139 farmers were affected and their crop details were enumerated. All of these farmers had crop insurance too, which was a saving grace.

The second most affected crop was cotton in 30 villages of 12 mandals belonging to 1,393 farmers, who had sown in 1719.35 hectares. The majority of the crop damage was in Peddavadaguru, Gooty, and Pamidi mandals. Paddy in 21 villages of 11 mandals belonging to 277 farmers sown in 222.33 hectares was damaged.

The Chittoor urban police in the early hours of Thursday arrested a man who tried to extort money by claiming himself to be an ACB official assigned with the task of conducting raids on prominent people in Chittoor.

According to the police, the accused, Hari Krishna (35) of Gangavaram mandal in the district, called Chittoor MLA Jangalapalle Srinivasulu on Sunday and informed him that ACB raids were on the anvil. He reportedly told him to send some money, failing which his house would be raided. The MLA in turn asked his personal assistant to deal with the matter.

Hari Krishna told the PA that an ACB team was camping at a lodge in Chittoor and that a few more sleuths were on their way to conduct raids on some influential persons in Chittoor, including the MLA and furnished some confidential information pertaining to the MLA’s assets. He provided a mobile number, asking the PA to send ₹7,800 for food expenses of his team, contending that they had no cash at the midnight hour.

As the matter looked suspicious, it was brought to the notice of the Deputy SP (Special Branch) U. Sudhakar Reddy, who in turn alerted the urban police.

With the help of the mobile number given for money transfer, the police raided a lodge in the town and took the accused into custody.

Two others targeted

A preliminary inquiry revealed that he had resorted to the same trick on two more persons in the town simultaneously. Some documents showing information pertaining to the assets of some political and business people in Chittoor district and other parts of the State were seized from him.

The MLA confirmed to the media, the threatening call to him.

89,2020/10/08,Farm Acts will help farmers immensely: GVL,"‘They are a step towards implementing Swaminathan Commission recommendations

The three Acts pertaining to the farm sector enacted recently were a significant step towards implementing the recommendations made by the Swaminathan Commission in 2006, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, BJP MP and Spices Board’s chilli task force chairman, said on Thursday.

“Farmers stand to gain from these new pieces of legislation, which facilitate adoption of advanced technologies and remove bottlenecks in the supply chain, besides ensuring remunerative prices,” Mr. Narasimha Rao asserted while interacting with the chilli farmers at the market yard in Guntur.

‘Middlemen eliminated’

Mr. Narasimha Rao said chilli and tobacco were major crops in Guntur and Prakasam districts, and that the Farmer Producers Organisations (FPOs), to which the Centre accorded high priority, would be of immense help in earning decent returns.

“This is due to the elimination of middlemen, who have been a bane for farmers,” he observed.

Up to 1,000 farmers can join the FPOs. The Central government will extend a financial support of ₹25 lakh to each FPO for the first four years and scale up assistance through other means subsequently.

Mr. Narasimha Rao said the fear that the new laws would rob Agriculture Produce Market Committees of their autonomy was misplaced as they were not being meddled with.

“Henceforth, farmers can sell the produce through the Electronic National Agriculture Market without much difficulty. They can even trade their commodities anywhere in the country,” he added.

Necessary steps were taken for augmenting the value of commodities, particularly the perishable ones, and, thereby, enable the farmers to fetch minimum returns, he added.

Raghunath Babu, Guntur chilli yard chairman Chandragiri Yesu Ratnam and BJP State vice-president Ravela Kishore Babu were among those present.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/5e85yn/article32809720.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJPG4-GVL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/farm-acts-will-help-farmers-immensely-gvl/article32807215.ece

92,2020/10/08,Children strike a chord with ‘Jagan mama’,"Getting pally with the CM, they vow to make best use of govt. schemes to come up in life

The launch of the much-awaited Jagananna Vidya Kanuka scheme at the Punadipadu Zilla Parishad High School in Kankipadu mandal of Krishna district on Thursday became a platform for Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and the schoolchildren to shower their love and affection on each other.

Before the formal launch of the programme, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy went round the classrooms, taking a look at the spanking new look of the place, sat with the children on the newly-painted benches, and interacted with them.

Later, in his speech, the Chief Minister said he did not want children from the economically poor families left out in the race of quality education.

“We are giving them new uniforms, textbooks, shoes, socks, belt and a school bag. They will now go to school wearing a new uniform and carrying a set of new things in a new bag. Let them also know that now their “mama” (maternal uncle) is the Chief Minister who will take care of all their needs,” he said amidst loud applause.

Shaik Tasleem, a Class IV student from the mandal parishad primary school, won hearts instantly by addressing the Chief Minister as “mavayya” (mother’s brother).

‘Want to become Collector’

The young girl said she wanted to become a Collector, which now seemed possible through the various schemes launched by the government. She went on to wish that her “Jagan mavayya” should be in power till then to witness her serving the poor just like he was doing now.

The girl said their school was now equipped with all facilities, it looked good as it was given a facelift under the Nadu-Nedu programme, and the children were served nutritious food under the ‘Goru Mudda’ programme.

“Our mavayya knows what we need to come up in life,” she said, and promised to make the best of the various programmes to study hard and become a responsible citizen.

Leela Lahari, a Class V student from the Mandal Parishad School at Kankipadu, said she went to a private school till third class. Due to financial problems, she shifted to a government school. But last year, her family realised that the scenario was changing when her mother received a cash assistance of ₹15,000 under the ‘Amma Vodi’ programme.

“And now, I have received this gift of school kit from my maama,” she said, looking at a smiling Chief Minister.

Lahari promised to work hard to achieve what she aspired in life and said she would also tell her friends and others about the advantages of studying in government schools.

English medium

Usha Kumari, a member of the Parents Committee of the government school at Punadipadu, appealed to the Chief Minister to bring in English medium as a mode of instruction as it would help their children compete with others with confidence.

94,2020/10/08,"Poverty should not deprive a child of quality education, says CM","Launches Vidya Kanuka covering about 43 lakh kids in government schools

Poverty should not prevent children from economically weaker sections from pursuing quality education. This is why the government is changing the face of government schools through a series of schemes to take care of every aspect of a child’s growing years, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said here on Thursday.

Speaking at the launch of Jagananna Vidya Kanuka at a Zilla Parishad School in Punadipadu under Kankipadu mandal in Krishna district, Mr. Jagan said about 43 lakh children of classes 1 to 10 in government schools would receive kits worth ₹650 crore in the next three days. The kits include three pairs of uniform cloth along with stitching charges, textbooks, notebooks, a pair of shoes, two pairs of socks, a belt and a school bag.

Quoting Nobel laureate and activist for girl education from Pakistan Malala Yousafzai and Nelson Mandela, the Chief Minister said the government had realised the need for comprehensive changes in the education sector to enable children to compete with the world. The fact that even after 73 years of Independence, 34% people in the State were not literate spoke volumes about the priorities of the previous governments, he said.

Mr. Jagan said the TDP government never seemed to have realised why such large number of children were dropping out of schools, and said his government had ushered in revolutionary changes, from the anganwadi centres to the institutes of higher education.

Referring to Mana Badi-Nadu Nadu, he said schools were given a facelift and they were now equipped with proper toilets with water facility, fans and tubelights in classrooms, green boards and good furniture besides construction of compound walls, new kitchens and painting the buildings in vibrant colours.

Major schemes

Mr. Jagan listed other major schemes such as Amma Vodi, under which a financial assistance of ₹15,000 was deposited in the bank accounts of women who sent their children to government schools. “Nearly 43 lakh women and 82 lakh students benefited from the scheme,” he said, informing that the second phase of the programme would start on January 9.

He spoke about Sampoorna Poshana drive that was all about a nutritious diet to pregnant women and neonatal mothers at a cost of ₹1,800 crore to the exchequer and how Anganwadi centres were being transformed into YSR pre-primary schools.

Speaking about Jagananna Goru Mudda, Mr Jagan said like no other Chief Minister had ever done, he had taken personal care in deciding the daily menu to ensure that the children were served nutritious food. Complete fee reimbursement under Vidya Deevena and Vasathi Deevena programmes were aimed at helping economically backward students pursue their higher studies without any stress, he added.

Education Minister A. Suresh said children were eager to attend school and enjoy the new facilities.

Yet another round of talks between officials of the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation and their Telangana counterparts in Hyderabad Bus Bhavan on Wednesday remained inconclusive.

Inter-State bus operations between the two States had stopped in the last seven months on account of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic situation. The APSRTC is eager to resume operations to the neighbouring State, especially in view of the Dasara festivities, a time when there is heavy traffic of people travelling between the two States.

“In the name of route parity, they want too many advantages, compromising the interests of the APSRTC,” said a top official who was part of the talks.

APSRTC buses operate in 1.4 lakh km on the Hyderabad-Vijayawada-Garikapadu route while TSRTC operates in 33,000 km. “They now want parity for 67,000 km on the Vijayawada-Hyderabad route without they having to touch interior areas of Andhra Pradesh,” said the official. He said the Telangana RTC wanted sector-wise benefit. “In the name of parity, they are asking for something else,” he said.

Though a solution to the deadlock does not seem easy to come by, the APSRTC officials want to operate buses to Telangana on a temporary basis till March 2021, without waiting for a permanent settlement on the inter-State bus operations between the two States.

“We will send our proposals to the TSRTC in a couple of days with a hope that both sides will sort out the differences at the earliest,” said the official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/talks-between-ap-and-telangana-rtcs-remain-inconclusive/article32798015.ece

The Congress and other parties unleashed a false propaganda that these Acts would infringe on the rights of the States and were a loss-making proposition for the farmers, she stated while addressing an awareness programme on the laws, organised by the BJP here on Wednesday.

Ms. Sitharaman said the biggest advantage for the farmers was the facility to sell their produce anywhere in the country, devoid of any interference by the middlemen.

She alleged that the Congress party wanted to disband the Agricultural Produce Market Committees and even included it in its election manifesto.

Certain amendments made to the Essential Commodities Act would be of great help to the farmers who bore the brunt of the vagaries of the market.

Farmers too met Ms. Sitharaman at the village and apprised her of the problems they faced in selling the produce. They also brought to her notice the absence of Minimum Support Price for the crops.

Informing Ms. Sitharaman that the farmers of Jakkula Nekkalam, Gudavalli, Kesarapalli and Nidamanuru villages cultivated paddy and sugarcane, they explained her their difficulty in selling the produce as there were obstacles that needed to be removed.

Pointing out that labour cost had gone up, they said banks denied them loans, which further compounded their woes. The farmers appealed to the Union Finance Minister to ensure immediate steps for payment of ₹2,000 per quintal as support price for paddy.

101,2020/10/08,AU exams may be deferred by a month on students’ demand,"Classes have not been held for the last seven months owing to pandemic

Tension prevailed at Andhra University when students led by the SFI staged a dharna outside the campus on Monday, demanding cancellation of the examinations.

However, police who were present in good numbers did not allow the students to enter the campus.

The students were demanding cancellation of examinations which are scheduled to start later this week. Classes have not been held for the last seven months in the wake of pandemic.

Now that the AU authorities are gearing up to conduct the exams, students are demanding that the exams be cancelled.

On Wednesday, students gathered at the AU main gate to press for their demands. They entered into an argument with the police for not allowing them into the campus.

However, some students managed to sneak in and the police immediately swung into action and tried to pacify the students.

With the students did not agree to withdraw the protest, the police allowed a delegation of students to meet the university officials.

The officials told them that it was not possible to cancel the exams. However, they told that they would try to defer the exams by a month after discussing the issue with the authorities.

103,2020/10/08,Vizag zoo to launch volunteer programme today,"Team members will work as guides, animal keepers and pollution fighters

The Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (IGZP) will launch a ‘Zoo Volunteer Programme’ on October 8 (Thursday), as part of the Wildlife Week celebrations.

As part of the programme, the officials have divided several work areas – zoo reception and information team, zoo educators, zoo animal keeper team, zoo pollution fighters, zoo rescue team, zoo souvenir team.

According to IGZP Curator Nandani Salaria, the volunteers for zoo reception and information team comprising volunteers aged 15 years and above will man the information desk at the zoo entrance. They will act as information resource for the visitors by guiding them on directions, answering queries, and helping in resolution of complaints.

The educators’ team for volunteers aged 10 years and above will act as guides for the visitors. They will also help during the educational tours of schoolchildren and give commentary for those who visit in battery-operated vehicles.

The animal keeper team for volunteers aged 18 years and above will help in several activities such as feeding, cleaning, observation of animals.

The pollution fighter team for volunteers aged 18 years and above will help in screening of plastic in the zoo and create awareness on pollution. The IGZP will train and prepare the rescue team with volunteers aged 18 years and above and those with basic knowledge about animal rescue. They will help rescue animals in and around the zoo park, the curator said.

“The programme aims at bridging the gap between the humans and animals. It is an opportunity for those who love nature. The volunteers will help the zoo staff in their day to day functioning,” said Ms. Nandani Salaria, adding that the volunteers will be trained.

The Curator said the programme would be launched online, given the COVID-19 situation. Based on the number of registrations, the programme would be undertaken after the zoo reopens for visitors, she added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vizag-zoo-to-launch-volunteer-programme-today/article32797931.ece
104,2020/10/08,IISc. develops bandage with magnetic nanofibers that kills skin cancer cells with heat,"Researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) have developed a non-invasive bandage made with magnetic nanofibers to treat skin cancer by administering heat to the tumour cells.

The research was recently published in Cancer Reports, an international peer-reviewed journal.

Skin cancer, the most common kind of cancer, is caused mainly due to excessive exposure to ultraviolet rays from the sun. Common treatments for skin cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

But these treatments and other conventional therapies have limitations. A promising alternative that has emerged to treat skin cancer is magnetic hyperthermia, in which magnetic nanoparticles are used to heat the tumours by using an external alternating current magnetic field (AMF). But it is difficult to achieve uniform heating of the affected tissues using such magnetic nanoparticles because of uncontrolled aggregation. Besides, they can accumulate in the human body and induce toxicity.

A team of researchers led by Kaushik Suneet and Shilpee Jain from the Centre for BioSystems Science and Engineering (BSSE) and the Department of Molecular Reproduction, Development and Genetics (MRDG) at IISc. have developed the bandage with a unique blend of magnetic nanoparticles fabricated using a method called electrospinning. It comprises nanoparticles made from an oxide of iron, Fe3O4, and a biodegradable polymer called polycaprolactone (PCL) pasted on a surgical tape. The magnetic material generates heat when it is subjected to a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field.

In order to investigate whether the heat generated and dissipated by the magnetic bandage can treat skin cancer, the researchers did two experiments: one in vitro – on human cancer cell lines – and the other in vivo – on mice with artificially-induced skin cancer.

In both experiments, the heat generated by applying AMF to the nanofibrous magnetic bandage killed the cancer cells successfully. Moreover, in the in vivo experiment, the healthy tissue remained intact with no signs of burns, inflammation, or thickening, said Mr. Suneet.

“The elevated temperature at the treatment site enables heat to penetrate the tumour cells, rupturing the compact random vasculatures (network of blood vessels) of the tumours,” explained Ms. Jain, who was a DST-INSPIRE Faculty Fellow at BSSE when the study was conducted. “In contrast, the normal healthy cells, owing to their organised open vasculatures, dissipate the heat to maintain normal temperatures, and so remain unharmed,” she said.

Although this novel treatment has been shown to be effective against skin cancer in lab experiments, it is still at a nascent stage of development as a clinical therapy. “Further studies are required to test the efficacy on a larger scale in rabbits, dogs, and monkeys, before employing it for pre-clinical and clinical applications,” she cautioned.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/iisc-develops-bandage-with-magnetic-nanofibers-that-kills-skin-cancer-cells-with-heat/article32807538.ece
105,2020/10/08,Mahadayi: State govt. gearing up to counter Goa’s allegations,"Diversion of the Mahadayi waters is nearly impossible, say officials

Irrigation Department officials in Karnataka are gearing up to counter Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant’s claim that the State is diverting the Mahadayi waters in a way that it can change the river’s course. Goa has filed a contempt petition in this regard in the Supreme Court.

Mr. Sawant had alleged at a press meet in Panaji earlier this week that Karnataka was diverting the Mahadayi waters. He also alleged that Karnataka had begun work on the Kalasa-Banduri Nala projects without due permits and clearances from the Central government. Subsequently, the neighbouring State filed a contempt petition against Karnataka.

Karnataka Irrigation Department engineers told The Hindu that they were yet to get a clear idea about what is in the petition since there was no official communication.

“But based on Goa Chief Minister’s press conference, we can infer that they are alleging that we have diverted the Mahadayi waters in violation of rules. That is not true,” said Mallikarjun Gunge, managing director of the Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Ltd., the special purpose vehicle tasked with the Mahadayi project.

‘No diversion’

“There has been no diversion of any kind. They have also alleged that we have begun work in the Mahadayi river basin without obtaining due permits from Central agencies. That is also far from truth. We have applied to all jurisdictional agencies and we are waiting for permissions,” he said.

“When the Mahadayi tribunal, a Supreme Court-appointed body, gave its award allocating separable share of water to the riparian States, both Karnataka and Goa opposed it. We have both approached the Supreme Court against the award and that is pending there. We will take our next steps once that is settled,” he added.

Diversion of the Mahadayi waters is “nearly impossible” because the barrier built between the nalas and the river is an underground concrete wall that is six metres wide. “It cannot be opened or removed easily. We have not even contemplated that,” he said.

Karnataka’s legal team in New Delhi is also waiting to hear about the petition. “We are yet to get a copy of the petition, if it has been filed,” said Mohan Kataraki, senior advocate in the Supreme Court who is part of Karnataka’s legal team. According to him, Karnataka had ably answered all the issues raised in Goa’s contempt in 2018. “It was not very significant and did not have much impact. Similarly, we don’t believe the current petition will have much of an impact,” he said.

Major and Medium Irrigation Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi said his department had not taken any illegal steps. “We are taking all necessary legal steps to get approvals before starting work,” the Minister said.

Site visit

Meanwhile, Goa-based environmentalist Rajendra Kerkar told The Hindu, “We requested Goa to file the contempt petition as Karnataka has gone ahead with the diversion despite the assurances given by senior counsel Fali Nariman. Goa government engineers have visited the work sites and collected documents and pictures of the diversion work. This is being presented before the Supreme Court.” He claimed that it was not a sustainable project and would cause great harm to the Western Ghats.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/oa8hm/article32807470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGMAHADAYIRIVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mahadayi-state-govt-gearingup-to-counter-goas-allegations/article32807471.ece
106,2020/10/08,57 nominations filed for Council polls,"As many as 57 candidates have filed their nomination papers in the four Legislative Council constituencies going to the polls in the State. Thursday was the last day for filing nominations.

The final list of candidates in the fray will be known on October 12, the last date for withdrawal of nominations. There are a few candidates who have rebelled against their respective parties and filed nominations, and they are expected to withdraw from the race.

Bangalore Teachers, Karnataka South-east Graduates, North-east Teachers, and Karnataka West Graduates constituencies are going to the poll on October 28, following the retirement of members on June 30. The polls had been deferred by the Election Commission owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The counting of votes will be taken up on November 2.

Number game

Currently in the 75-member Upper House, the Congress has 28 members while the BJP has 27. The Janata Dal (Secular) has 14 members, besides Chairman K. Prathapchandra Shetty and an Independent. The elections are seen as important by both the ruling BJP and the Congress to increase the number in the Upper House. Incidentally, on the last day of the legislature session a fortnight ago, the combined Opposition — Congress and JD(S) — defeated a crucial Bill bringing about changes to labour laws, and stalled two more Bills pertaining to the Land Reforms Act and the APMC Act.

Those in fray

Among those in the fray include Sharanappa Mattur (Congress) in the North-east Teachers constituency, Puttanna (BJP) in Bangalore Teachers constituency, R. Chowdareddy (Janata Dal-Secular) in Karnataka South-east Graduates constituency and S.V. Sankanur (BJP) in Karnataka West Graduates constituency whose retirement earlier had caused the vacancy in the Council. The other prominent candidates in the fray include former MLCs Sashil Namoshi (BJP) from North-east Teachers constituency and Ramesh Babu (Congress) from South-east Graduates constituency.

107,2020/10/08,HC opposes move to appoint only IAS orI FS officers as KSPCB member-secretary,"Says no appointment can be made to posts of chairperson and member-secretary sans court permission

Declining to accept the guidelines framed by the State government for selecting candidates to the posts of chairperson and member-secretary of the Karnataka State pollution Control Board (KSPCB), the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday said the government could not have decided to appoint only an officer from the cadre of IAS or IFS to the post of member-secretary of the board.

Also, the court said that in the light of the Supreme Court’s judgment in Techi Tagi Tara vs. Rajendra Singh Bhandari case it was the duty of the State government to prescribe the educational qualification for the post of the chairperson.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the order while hearing a batch of PIL petitions questioning the legality of the guidelines fixed for selecting candidates to posts of member, member- secretary, and chairperson in the KSPCB.

The Bench said the board must consist of persons having technical expertise and experience in dealing with environmental matters as the board plays a pivotal and crucial role in implementing three important laws, the Environment (Protection) Act, the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, enacted to protect environment and ecology.

The apex court, the Bench said, had referred to the recommendations made by a committee, which had said that the member-secretary of the State Pollution Control Boards should possess a postgraduate degree in science, engineering or technology and have adequate experience of working in the areas of environment protection.

Pointing out that State government had not given any reason for choosing officers from only IAS and IFS cadres for the post of the member secretary, the Bench said the guideline to consider officers of only these cadres was contrary to the provisions of the law while stating that the law does not refer to appointment only from IAS or IFS cadres.

While pointing out that appoint of officers of IAS or IFS cadres would affect functioning of the board as the government would transfer the officers frequently citing exigencies, the Bench said that the member-secretary requires a minimum tenure of two to three years.

While directing the government to reconsider qualification for both the posts, the Bench also said the government cannot appoint any person to these posts without prior permission of the court.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/3minow/article32807225.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-opposes-move-to-appoint-only-ias-orifs-officers-as-kspcb-member-secretary/article32807226.ece
108,2020/10/08,Bypolls amid pandemic risks people’s lives: HDK,"He, however, says JD(S) will contest the byelections to two Assembly seats

The former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy has questioned the timing of the byelections to two Legislative Assembly segments and polls to four Legislative Council seats amid the pandemic.

“What would have happened if the polls to the Bihar Assembly and bypolls to 54 constituencies were delayed by three months? What would have happened if President’s rule was imposed in Bihar for three months and a caretaker government allowed?” Mr. Kumaraswamy asked. He said he was running a temperature after a two-day visit to Sira.He told reporters here: “Winning or losing is common for political parties. Just because you win one election, can we get power? Politicians are playing with the lives of people. In these circumstances, how do we participate in elections? We have to go to villages where crowds will gather. Will everyone be wearing masks or is it possible to maintain social distance?”

However, Mr. Kumaraswamy said the JD(S) will contest the byelections to the two seats, and brushed aside allegations of Congress leaders that the JD(S) was contesting to help the BJP win elections. “Whether we win or lose, we will fight in both the seats.” While the party has finalised Ammajamma as the candidate for Sira, it is yet to name its nominee for R.R. Nagar segment, he added.

On Congress and BJP poaching JD(S) leaders, he said such party-hopping was common as many leaders after enjoying power and position in the JD(S) join other parties. “Two zilla panchayat members, including a former zilla panchayat president, have gone to the national parties. Two of the Congress’ nominees for the Council elections were in the JD(S),” he said.

‘Why raise caste census issue now?’

Accusing the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah of indulging in “caste politics”, Mr. Kumaraswamy questioned the timing of the former urging the State government to accept the caste census report. “When I was the Chief Minister for 14 months, Mr. Siddaramaiah was the chairman of the coordination committee. He did not talk about it then. Why is he asking the government to accept it now?” Mr. Kumaraswamy asked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bypolls-amid-pandemic-risks-peoples-lives-hdk/article32807208.ece

110,2020/10/08,COVID-19: ‘Majority of the people who died had comorbid conditions’,"Also, they were over 55 years, says BBMP’s external death audit team

The external death audit team constituted by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to undertake an audit of all fatalities owing to COVID-19 in various hospitals in the city has observed that a majority of people who died were aged over 55 and had comorbid conditions/complications.

The observations were submitted to civic chief N. Manjunath Prasad.

Mortality was high within 72 hours of hospitalisation as a large number of patients were brought to the hospital after delay or were in bad clinical condition at the time of admission. The audit also noted that most of the patients who died had been admitted to ICU and ICU-ventilator beds, and a majority had major comorbid conditions/complications.

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city, as many as 3,191 persons have succumbed to it (as on October 6, 2020), taking the mortality rate to 1.22%. The total number of COVID-19 cases stood at 2.62 lakh. With 19.22 lkah total tests conducted, the positivity rate stood at 13.64%, according to the COVID-19 war room bulletin.

The committee, which had been formed after some hospitals recorded a high case fatality ratio, made several recommendations to be implemented at the community, institutional and administrative levels.

At the community level, it recommended strengthening monitoring protocols and follow-ups of patients in home isolation to identify complications early for timely hospitalisation. Facilities in ambulances also need to be reviewed in view of patient deterioration en route to hospitals, it noted.

Address data mismatch

At the institutional level, the committee underscored the need for standardisation of documentation and reporting systems with respect to death forms and presenting statistics to the BBMP, as there was mismatch in data sets.

The committee also found that some deaths were not directly due to COVID-19 and some institutions had wrongly put down the immediate cause of death as COVID-19 in the death certificates. In the death certificates, the immediate cause of death should not be merely COVID-19 but the medical condition leading to the death, it noted.

With several medical college hospitals getting referrals from corporate and private hospitals and smaller government centres, it is essential that such serious cases are better managed in the initial stages in the same institutions to reduce hospital mortality, said the report.

Infrastructure gaps with respect to ventilators, oxygen availability and supply, manpower should be addressed, while protocols of treatment need to be uniform and rationalised. The committee also recommended addressing comorbid conditions and putting in place standard operating procedures and follow-up protocol, as well as closer monitoring of the elderly.

Community awareness

At the administrative level, it called for greater emphasis on community education on getting tested, seeking medical help early and removal of stigma associated with COVID-19. When it came to infrastructure, the committee recommended good quality ventilators and other equipment in government hospitals and enlisting more hospitals in the private sector to increase bed allocation etc. Regular internal death audits in all institutions, encouraging review of treatment protocols and addressing infrastructural and clinical defects have to be prioritised.

Mr. Prasad said that towards improving infrastructure, the State government had procured 200 ventilators – 100 each distributed to private and government hospitals. Installation will be completed over the next week.

Though the number of positive cases being reported had increased, there was no issue with regard to availability of beds, he maintained. He said there still were around 10% vacancy in the beds available for treatment of COVID-19 patients. “When the average cases reported were around 3,000 a day, the vacancy was around 20% to 30%. This has now come down to around 10%,” he said.

Mr. Prasad also said that two COVID Care Centres, each with 100 bed capacity, would be opened in Sarvagna Nagar and Shantinagar. “We will open more centres, if required. As of now, we do not foresee such a requirement,” he said, and added that residents’ welfare associations had been directed to help the civic body identify people with ILI/SARI, comorbidities, and elderly citizens.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/s98enn/article32807074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/External-death-audit-points-to-earlyTHIMG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-majority-of-the-people-who-died-had-comorbid-conditions/article32807077.ece

Following a surge in COVID-19 cases in some parts of the State, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Thursday instructed officials of 10 districts to conduct more tests and track primary and secondary contacts to contain the spread and mortality rates.

The virtual meeting with the Deputy Commissioners, chief executive officers, superintendent of police, and district health officers of the 10 districts assumed significance in the wake of the forthcoming Dasara festivities and byelections to two legislative Assembly and four Council seats in the State.

In the presence of Cabinet colleagues, the Chief Minister held a videoconference with the officials at his home officer ‘Krishna’, and directed the district administration to adopt a target-oriented approach to detect COVID-19 cases to provide treatment on time.

The meeting did not discuss reopening of schools and colleges, said one Deputy Commissioner. The State government has not taken a decision on reopening of schools and colleges in the State, though the Central guidelines left it to the discretion of States to take a decision after October 15.

Top district officials of Ballari, Dakshina Kannada, Hassan, Dharwad, Belagavi, Mysuru, Shivamogga, Tumakuru, Udupi, and Uttara Kannada attended the meeting. Mr. Yediyurappa instructed officials to intensify RT-PCR tests and reduce the number of rapid antigen tests. On the rise in the number of deaths in some districts such as Dharwad, he told officials to conduct death audits as most of the deaths occurred after 72 hours of the patients’ admission to hospitals. Over 50% of COVID-19 deaths occurred within 72 hours of hospital admission, he said.

With a surge in cases in the Mysuru district, the Chief Minister informed the district administration to conduct more virtual programmes to contain the pandemic. The district administration has been told to submit a report on the present status of the pandemic and precautionary steps taken. A large number of tourists visit Mysuru during Dasara.

Let people talk however lightly about my party. I will only respond after the elections. My focus is on organising the party and fighting the elections,” he said.

He was addressing a media conference at his party office in Kalaburagi on Thursday.

Multiple reasons

Asked about the current economic and employment crisis, the former Prime Minister said that the country’s economic crisis had multiple reasons, including “global events” and the COVID-19 situation.

“I am observing everything. The political war between the Congress and the BJP has begun,” he said.

Asked about the inter-State dispute over sharing the Krishna waters, Mr. Gowda said that he had fought for Cauvery and Mahadayi waters in the past and would continue to fight for the Krishna waters. “I have become a Rajya Sabha member as the party forced me to do so. I will continue to fight in Parliament against any injustice to the State,” he said.

Rambo was buried with police honours, including gun salute, underlining the love and respect he commanded from the police for the services rendered for nearly seven years. Rambo, who would have celebrated his birthday on October 15, suffered a cardiac arrest on Wednesday on completion of a task at Suratkal. He was buried at Madikeri Police Grounds on Thursday.

At least 12 districts in Karnataka have registered a dip in the number of active COVID-19 cases during the three-week period ending October 3, while most of the other districts in the State continued to see numbers rise.

Even though the number of active cases in the State rose from 97,815 on September 12 to 1,12,783 on October 3, districts like Gadag, Davangere, Ballari, Belagavi, Yadgir, Bidar, Bagalkot, Mandya, Shivamogga, Koppal, Kalaburagi, and Haveri managed to drop their active caseload.

While districts like Mysuru and Raichur almost flattened the active case growth curve by allowing only a marginal rise in their numbers, districts like Chamarajanagar, Chickballapur, Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada, Vijayapura, Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Uttara Kannada, Hassan, Bengaluru Urban, Chikkamagaluru, Ramanagaram, Chitradurga, Tumakuru, Dharwad, and Udupi saw their active cases increase during the three-week period.

The rate of decline in active cases was highest in Gadag district, which almost halved them from 1,177 to 616 during the study period, showing a negative growth rate of 47.7% followed by Davangere, which brought down the active cases from 2,557 to 1,494, indicating a negative growth rate of 41.6%.

On the other hand, Chamarajanagar recorded the steepest Moving Growth Rate (MGR) of 215% in the State with its active cases increasing from 360 on September 12 to 1,134 on October 2. Chickballapur also recorded a high growth rate in terms of active cases with the numbers going up from 1,003 on September 12 to 1,949 on October 3, registering a MGR of 94.3%. Kodagu’s active cases during the period went up from 310 to 503, showing a MGR of 62.3%.

In Bengaluru Urban, the number of active cases went up from 40,929 on September 12 to 53,292 on October 3, indicating a MGR of about 30% during the three-week period.

Jeevan Raksha, an initiative by management consultant firm Proxima, which is studying COVID-19 trends across the country, noticed a trend of mixed performances among various districts in a State.

Active growth case

The number of active cases can go up when the patients are not recovering as fast as anticipated while the number of positive cases continue to mount, said convener of Jeevan Raksha, Mysore Sanjeev.

“The active growth case reflects the quality of containment management of a particular district in a given point of time,” said Mr. Sanjeev.

117,2020/10/08,"Over 15,000 govt. schools see rise in enrolment for 2020-21","Some schools report 10% increase in student strength, several others record 100%

In an unusual reversal of the usual trend which sees parents rushing to private schools for admissions, enrolment in government schools has increased compared to the previous year. According to data provided by the Department of Public Instruction, 15,189 government primary schools have recorded an increase in student intake. There are 43,287 government primary schools in the State.

While the increase in student strength is around 10% in some schools, several schools have reported a 100% increase. In many instances, government schools have been forced to turn away students due to constraints in infrastructure.

The department is still in the process of collecting data for the 2020-21 academic year. So far, 42.5 lakh children have been admitted to government schools, 12.17 lakh students to government aided schools, and 40.57 lakh children to private unaided schools. Data for eight lakh students is yet to be collated.

For the 2019-20 academic year, 43.28 lakh students were enrolled in government schools, while private unaided school enrolment was 46.13 lakh and aided schools had 13.33 lakh students.

Gangadharappa B.R., Headmaster of Government Model Higher Primary School, Menase, Sringeri taluk, Chikkamagaluru district, said their enrolments from LKG to class 1 for this academic year stands at 245. Last year, the student strength was 185. “We have been taking up several measures to improve the quality of education in our school, but the increase in the number of students this year is unprecedented. Parents of 30 students have removed their students from private schools and enrolled them in our school,” he said.

One of the main reasons for this sudden ‘popularity’ in government schools is the fees. Many families are pulling their children out of private schools as they can no longer afford private school fees due to salary cut or job loss on account of the pandemic. “It was not a choice we wanted to make but we were pushed to make this decision for financial reasons,” said Gautam S., an autorickshaw driver who has admitted his son to class 4 in a government school for this academic year.

Government schools in rural areas are also reporting an increase in student strength as many families have migrated from urban areas to rural areas after they lost their jobs during the pandemic.

Rishikesh B.S., associate professor, Azim Premji University, said that there is a good chance of parents who have made the switch to government schools keeping their children there even when the crisis is over. “They will realise that the quality of education in government schools is far better than some of the private schools. Teachers at government schools will also do everything they can to ensure that the children are retained in their schools,” he said.

V. Anbukumar, Commissioner for Public Instruction, said that the reasons for improvement in government school enrolments could be attributed to the efforts of the State government as well. “We have started the Vidyagama scheme where teachers from government schools go to the neighbourhood where students reside and teach them. The government has also started English-medium sections in government schools, which have received a good response,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kfvmqy/article32806773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGSCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/over-15000-govt-schools-see-rise-in-enrolment-for-2020-21/article32806774.ece

119,2020/10/08,Expatriates returning to work abroad to get RT-PCR report in eight hours,"Test results to be valid for 96 hours from the time of swab collection

Having ramped up testing facilities in Dakshina Kannada district, District Health and Family Welfare Officer Ramachandra Bairy on Thursday said expatriates, who are going abroad to resume work, will get reports of RT-PCR test for COVID-19 within eight hours of collection of their samples.

Speaking at the general meeting of the Zilla Panchayat here, Dr. Bairy said that the expatriates should clearly mention that they are undergoing the RT-PCR test as they need to resume work abroad. “They will get their reports within six to eight hours,” he said.

This test will be done free at the laboratory of the Government Wenlock Hospital, while it will cost ₹ 1,600 if it is done in private laboratories. The test results will be valid for 96 hours from the time of swab collection.

Panchayat members Koragappa Nayak, Mamata Gatty and Dhanalakshmi pointed to problems faced by patients in getting treatment for COVID-19 and other ailments in private hospitals. They pointed out that patients are charged hefty amount for preliminary investigation tests and treatment is not given till the amount is paid.

“How can you expect a poor patient to deposit money before hand when he is eligible for free treatment under the Ayushman Bharat Arogya Karnataka scheme,” Ms. Gattay asked. Another member K. Sujatha said that a hospital made a patient wait for eight days to give treatment.

Dr. Bairy said that directions were issued to all medical officers in taluk hospitals and community hospitals to refer all suspected COVID-19 cases to the Government Wenlock Hospital. “If the patient needs specialist services, we will refer to private hospitals,” he said. Hospitals were directed to treat emergency cases as suspected COVID-19 patients and continue with treatment in anticipation of RT-PCR test result. Most of the RT-PCR test results were being issued within 24 hours, he added.

On the demand for waiving charges for CT Scan and preliminary investigation tests being done for Ayushman Bharat Arogya Karnataka beneficiaries, Dr. Bairy said that nothing can be done at their level as it was a policy decision of the State government to collect preliminary investigation fees.

Staging the demonstration in front of the Mini Vidhana Soudha in Hubballi, chairman of KPCC SC Department F.H. Jakkappanavar and district president of KPCC SC Department Shankar Hosamani strongly condemned the incident and termed it a disgrace to civil society.

They said that ever since the BJP-led NDA government came to power at the Centre, a series of such inhuman crimes and massacres were being reported in the country. What was even more shameful was the apathetic attitude of Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath towards the victim’s family. Instead of taking quick action against all those involved in the crime, supporters of Mr. Yogi, supported by the government and the police, had launched a smear campaign against the victim and her family, which was a highly degrading act, they said.

The protestors sought the intervention by the President in the matter and capital punishment to all those involved in the heinous crime against the young Dalit woman. They said that the Uttar Pradesh government was behaving like a dictator in its bid to prevent the Opposition from taking the Constitutional path of agitation to seek justice for the victim’s family.

The protestors also sought an immediate relief of ₹ 5 crore to the victim’s family and urged the President to intervene.

Dasara elephants led by Abhimanyu are having it easy though they are undergoing routine practice since the last few days within the palace premises and getting acclimatised to the urban environment.

Unlike in the past, Dasara has been reduced to symbolism this year due to the pandemic and will be devoid of the 5-km-long procession in which the presence of the elephants was the top attraction. In all, 12 elephants used to camp in the city for 45 days ahead of the festivities and it was done to help them get acclimatised to the din and noise of the city. It was also an exercise to make the elephants familiar with the procession route.

But this year’s event slated to take place from October 17 to 27 will be a simple affair and confined to the palace premises. So instead of the customary 12 elephants, only 5 elephants will participate and the procession will hardly cover around 400 metres to 500 metres. Hence the veterinarians have decided that a daily walk of 1.5 km around the palace premises was sufficient an exercise to keep the elephants fit instead of the regular walk of 10 km from the palace to Bannimantap and back which was the norm all these years.

Abhimanyu began “weight training”’ and carried a sand bag weighing 350 kg on Thursday. The weight of the sand bag will gradually be increased over the next few days to match the 750 kg weight of the golden howdah which it will carry during the Vijayadashmi procession on October 27.

Elephant Vikrama too will under go “weight training” from Friday and be a standby for Abhimanyu. The elephants’ health was being regularly monitored by a team of veterinarians led by Dr. Nagaraj. Abhimanyu and company were being fed with a special diet to enable them to gain weight and strength and be fit for the procession.

The entry of elephants to the palace every year during Dasara used to draw a huge crowd to watch their daily activities and was a photo opportunity for the tourists. But the authorities have banned the entry of visitors to the elephant camps and tourists are conspicuous by their absence at the palace due to the pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/584czl/article32804893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08MYSELEP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/abhimanyu-and-company-have-it-easy/article32804732.ece
126,2020/10/08,CID begins inquiry into ‘custodial death’,"Officials of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) have begun investigation in a case of custodial death of a resident of Vittalapura village at Mayakonda Police Station in Davangere district.

According to police sources, a CID team, led by Deputy Superintendent of Police Girish, began investigation in the case on Wednesday. Already, four police personnel, including a sub-inspector, have been arrested in connection with the case. They have also been suspended from service.

Vrundamma, wife of Marulasiddappa of Vittallapura village, had complained to Mayakonda Police seeking help to trace her missing husband who had left home to live with another woman. The Mayakonda Police subsequently traced him at nearby Huchchavvana Halli and had brought him to the police station on Monday.

The police had reportedly asked the family members to resolve the issue through dialogue and the complainant’s family had conveyed it to the police that they would come on Tuesday. However, in a later development, Marulasiddappa’s body was found near the railway station on Tuesday afternoon. The family members of Marulasiddappa had laid a siege to the police station alleging that the police had beaten the victim to death, while the local police denied it and said that they had let him off as he complained of uneasiness.

A case was registered at the Mayakonda Police Station on Tuesday night itself and Deputy Superintendent of Police Narasimha Tamradhwaj was appointed as the inquiry officer by the Superintendent of Police of Davangere Hanumantharaya.

In the wake of a complaint of custodial death, initially Sub-Inspector of Police Prakash, Head Constable Nagaraj and Constable Sher Ali were suspended and arrested. Later, another Constable Rangaswamy too was suspended and arrested.

Inspector-General of Police of Eastern Range S. Ravi, who had rushed to the station on Tuesday night, had assured the family members of handing over the case to the CID for investigation.

129,2020/10/08,Farm bills will boost farmers’ income: Sadananda Gowda,"He says the reforms are in line with the Centre’s vision of one nation, one market for agriculture

Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers and former Chief Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda on Thursday said farmers can now sell their produce anywhere and to anybody in the country at the price of their wish with the passing of three bills on agriculture market reforms in accordance to the Centre’s vision of “one nation, one market for agriculture”. The larger idea is to double farmers’ income, he added.

Speaking at a press conference here, the Minister said farmers can now sell produce from the field itself with all restrictions removed. If they wish, they can turn into entrepreneurs, carrying out direct marketing of their produce besides marketing their produce to food processing industries, private traders or directly to the consumers with no compulsions on them whatsoever.

As per the laws, farmers can finalize the price of their produce well in advance by having an understanding with retail and wholesale traders; finished goods’ manufacturers; hotels and other interested parties. The bills overcome all uncertainties on the farm produce, he explained.

The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 were passed in Parliament recently.

Lashing out at the Congress for misleading farmers on the Centre’s farm policies, Mr .Gowda said the Congress was not able to find any inaccuracies or discrepancies in the laws. Therefore, it is spreading lies and provoking farmers against the Centre. This is a ploy to defame the Narendra Modi government, he alleged.

The former Chief Minister alleged that his party’s opponents were spreading rumours among farmers that the system of minimum support price (MSP) was being withdrawn. It is false and there also no plans in the future as well on the issue. Not just continuing the MSP, but the Centre is strengthening the concept of MSP in future. Henceforth, before the season commences, the MSP would be announced.

The Minister for Agriculture has also clarified in Parliament on the continuation of MSP which has been reiterated by the Prime Minister.

Mr. Gowda claimed that the new laws would bring price stability with farmers getting better opportunities for inter-state marketing of their produce. This will also result in expansion of the food processing industry, creating more jobs in the area. “The laws are aimed at revolutionising the farm sector,” he maintained.

130,2020/10/08,COVID-19 testing in Mysuru is now above target,"124 per cent testing done on Wednesday; in September only 45 per cent of target was met

The COVID-19 testing in Mysuru has been ramped up with more than 100 per cent target achieved since Wednesday.

The surge comes after the government asked the district administration to carry out more testing in the wake of the infection rate spiking exponentially besides an upsurge in deaths.

Consequently, the district administration sought two-weeks’ time to show the results and the ramping up of testing across the district.

Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri said testing was unsatisfactory all through the month of September. As against the target, 45 per cent testing was done last month. Testing is critical to identify infected persons early and give them treatment. Besides, it prevents the spread of the infection among the community, she said.

Ms Sindhuri said Mysuru is now doing more testing and has started achieving more than 100 per cent target. On Wednesday, 124 percent testing was achieved.

She said special testing teams had been constituted and officers had been posted to Mysuru city as well as various places in the districts to coordinate and ensure successful testing.

The word of caution from the Ministers amidst rapid surge in cases resulted in massive jump in testing with the opening of new testing centres. Also, new centres, including one at the University of Mysore, are being identified to maximize the testing and control the spread. “The testing may even touch 10,000 a day by the end of this month,” said a senior health official, who is into COVID-19 management.

Devotees will not get a chance to visit Hasanamba Temple this year during Hasanamba Jatra scheduled between November 5 and 16, due to COVID-19 pandemic. Only very important persons, invited by the district administration, will be allowed inside on the first and the last day of the festival.

K. Gopalaiah, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, who is also Minister in charge of the district, told media that the administration would arrange 12 LED screens for the public to have glimpses of the deity during daily prayers.

The temple is opened only during this annual festival. Lakhs of people from different parts of the State and outside visit it. The officers felt it would be difficult to ensure physical distancing this time once the doors were opened for the devotees.

Mr. Gopalaiah told the media that Chief Minister B.S.Y ediyurappa would be invited on the first day of the jatra.

133,2020/10/08,Farmers oppose MUDA’s project at Ballahalli,"They see ‘conspiracy’ in large-scale acquisition of agricultural land

Farmers from Mysuru rural have expressed their ire over the proposed satellite township at Ballahalli on the outskirts of the city as it entails large-scale acquisition of agricultural land.

The project was proposed by the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) years ago and efforts are on to acquire nearly 500 acres of land at Ballahalli which is located about 6 km off the Outer Ring Road from Dattagalli in Mysuru West.

The agitating farmers gathered outside the MUDA office on Thursday and raised slogans seeking abolition of the project. A section of the farmers alleged that the land registered in the name of the MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajiv at Ballahalli, has been kept out of the purview of the notification and termed it as a conspiracy.

The farmers alleged that real-estate sharks were keen to create a land bank so as to sell it to investors in future and it was a conspiracy to divest the farmers of their property.

But the MUDA authorities have stated that the Ballahalli satellite project does not entail outright purchase of land. Instead, farmers will be made partners in development and they will sign an agreement with the MUDA which will develop the land and sell 50 per cent of the sites to the public while the farmers will be free to sell the remaining 50 per cent of their share at the prevailing market rate in lieu of compensation.

This arrangement, according to the MUDA, was beneficial to the farmers as they can sell the sites at a rate higher than a one-time cash payment awarded by way of compensation for land acquisition. For the MUDA, it will save enormous cost that is incurred towards land purchase.

However, the farmers from the region are wary that they would not only be divested of their land but they will not come across suitable buyers at such far-flung areas. This will enable real-estate sharks to artificially depress the site value and procure it from them (farmers) at a lower rate.

Members of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene have also opposed the project on the grounds that acquisition of prime agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes will have a long-term bearing on food security.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qw4tu/article32804917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08MYSFARMERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/farmers-oppose-mudas-project-at-ballahalli/article32803361.ece
134,2020/10/08,"Soon, collision avoidance mechanism in buses","Anti-drowsiness systems designed to detect a driver’s alertness and can even sound an alarm if the driver dozes off at the wheel.

The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) will be upgrading its technology for its fleet with the aim of reducing accidents. It plans to introduce collision avoidance mechanisms and anti-drowsiness systems that will provide real-time alerts to drivers, conductors and the control room.

The technology, said officials, will go a long way in curbing accidents. Anti-drowsiness systems, for instance, are designed to detect a driver’s alertness and can even sound an alarm if the driver dozes off at the wheel. Cameras constantly monitor the driver’s face and retina to detect how alert he or she is.

A KSRTC official said trial runs using collision avoidance mechanisms were held and deemed ‘satisfactory’. “Such systems are available in high-end expensive cars and it works perfectly well. This will save hundreds of lives and reduce risk and increase our efficiency,” the official said.

The system comprises cameras and multiple features including warning systems for pedestrian collision, information on vehicles approaching from opposite sides, and distance between vehicles around the bus among others.

According to sources in the KSRTC, the tender process for implementation of the technology is in the offing and if everything goes as planned, it will be in place within three to four months. “According to our tentative list, around 1,000 buses that will ply at night especially on highways, inter-state buses and those plying ghat sections will get the technology on priority basis,” the KSRTC official added.

According to Laxman Savadi, Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister, KSRTC spends around ₹100 crore every year on accident compensation and related issues. “It is not only a question of money, more importantly lives are at stake. Our department is in touch with agencies that provide such services and the project will be rolled out soon,” he said.

The Minister added that once the system is in place, it will provide better safety measures not just for KSRTC employers but also to drivers, passengers and other motorists.

Another corporation official said: “Such mechanisms will help the KSRTC identify vulnerable spots along the bus route especially in the ghat sections. This will further help us in better management of road markers, traffic signs, lights among other things.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1c896h/article32798441.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGKSRTC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/soon-collision-avoidance-mechanism-in-buses/article32798442.ece

140,2020/10/08,VACB questions LIFE Mission CEO,"Probe into the deal with the UAE Red Crescent

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) on Wednesday reportedly interviewed LIFE Mission chief executive officer U. V. Jose.

The agency was probing whether the State agency had violated any laws while entering into a contract with UAE-Red Crescent to built 140 dwellings for needy families in Thrissur.

Investigators reportedly sought information on whether the former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister, M. Sivasankar, had any role in shaping the controversial agreement.

They also inquired whether the LIFE Mission had legally vetted the deal with UAE-Red Crescent before becoming a signatory in the memorandum of understanding struck with the foreign entity.

Pecunirary adavantage

The VACB also sought to probe whether if any government had official had caused any private party to gain pecuniary advantage from the deal. It also reportedly asked Mr. Jose if the LIFE Mission had any role in awarding the contract to a private builder who had testified in court that he had paid nearly ₹5 crore as bribe to brokers to seal the bargain.

The UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh, and few of her accomplices in the alleged offence had reportedly received brokerage from the builder for helping him bag the contract.

At the time of the agreement, Swapna was in the employ of the diplomatic mission. She often represented the consulate in its dealings with the government.

Number of apartments

The VACB has also factored in a complaint that the facilitators of the housing project had reduced the number of apartments from 200 to 140 to help the builder balance the amount he had paid as a bribe for the lucrative contract.

The LIFE Mission had maintained that it had no role in the award of the contract. The MoU clearly stated that the UAE-Red Crescent would build the dwellings on 2.8 acres of public land provided by the government at an estimated cost of ₹20 crores and hand them over to the State government for distribution to beneficiaries of the LIFE Mission scheme.

The government had also said the deal had caused no loss to the public exchequer. The CBI was probing whether the LIFE Mission had violated the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act by “accepting” aid from the UAE-Red Crescent.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vacb-questions-life-mission-ceo/article32806411.ece

142,2020/10/08,"CPI, NCP reluctant to hand over seats to Mani group","They feel LDF won’t benefit from the faction’s entry into the coalition

In what could be a major hurdle in the proposed induction of the Kerala Congress (M) faction led by Jose K. Mani into the Left Democratic Front (LDF), the district leadership of the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Thursday revealed their disinclination to give up any seats in their possession to the regional party.

While the NCP held that it would not give up the Pala Assembly constituency, long regarded as a bastion of the Mani group, the CPI was more explicit in its opposition to the proposed induction by stating that the regional party's entry was not going to make any difference.

“There is no question of giving up Pala, Kuttanad or any of our seats to anyone for anything. This is a decision taken by none other than the party president Sharad Pawar,” said Mani C. Kappan, the NCP legislator from Pala.

Mr. Kappan’s response comes amidst reports about the Mani faction holding discussions with the LDF leaders, including its convener, and looking to swap its Rajya Sabha seat with the NCP for Pala constituency.

No formal discussion

“The coalition is yet to initiate any formal discussion on the induction of the Mani group. As a key constituent of the LDF, we have welcomed the entry of a new partner but it should not come at a cost,” he added.

The CPI district leadership, on the other hand, maintains that the existing political situation does not warrant the entry of the Mani group into the LDF. Having held elaborate discussions on the proposed association with the Mani group in the various party forums, the CPI district leadership has reported the feedback of workers from the local level to the State leadership.

Pro-UDF vote base

“The Mani group has a pro-UDF vote base, which is unlikely to come in favour of the LDF,” C.K. Sasidharan, CPI district secretary told mediapersons here on Thursday. On the occasion, he also expressed the party’s unwillingness to hand over any of its sitting seats in the district to the Mani group.

The statements by the NCP and the CPI leadership assume significance particularly in the wake of a scheduled steering committee meeting of the KC(M) Mani group to be held on Friday. According to sources, pressure is mounting on the KC(M) leadership to take a political decision at the earliest in view of the upcoming local body elections.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cpi-ncp-reluctant-to-hand-over-seats-to-mani-group/article32805828.ece

About 25 cents had been found encroached upon and constructions done there. Udumbanchola tahsildar Niju Kurian directed the village officer to take action and the team demolished one building and another partially.

It was found that B.L.Ram residents Selvaraj and Mukesh Sivadasan had constructed the buildings encroaching on the catchment area under the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB).

When a group of people assembled there opposing the demolition, the revenue team returned and gave a report to the tahsildar. The report was given to the KSEB and a reply is expected to initiate further action, Mr. Kurien said.

A copy of the report was also given to the District Collector. For building constructions in Devikulam taluk, no-objection certificate from the revenue authority is mandatory as per a High Court order. The buildings were on the catchment area and without the NOC.

A revenue official said nearly 110 houses were in the catchment area under the KSEB. An inquiry found that almost all houses had house number and electricity connection. In the absence of follow-up action by the KSEB, there would be chances of further encroachments.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/illegal-constructions-in-catchment-area-demolished/article32805261.ece
146,2020/10/08,LIFE Mission project MoU an eyewash: CBI,"‘Sivasankar colluded with gold smuggling accused to hijack Wadakkanchery project’

The CBI on Thursday informed the Kerala High Court that the memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the implementation of the LIFE Mission’s apartments at Wadakkanchery, Thrissur was nothing but an eyewash.

The CBI counsel submitted that it was an “underbelly operation” carried out by Swapna Suresh, Sajith and Sandeep Nair, all accused in the diplomatic gold smuggling case.

The submission was made when petitions filed by Santhosh Eapen of Unitac Builders Private Ltd. and U. V. Jose, Chief Executive Officer of the LIFE Mission seeking to quash the FIR registered in connection with the construction of homes under the LIFE Mission project came up for hearing.

CBI contention

CBI counsel Sasthamangalam Ajithkumar submitted that the MoU had been hijacked by M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister with aid of notorious smugglers who are accused in the the diplomatic gold smuggling case.

There was a clear conspiracy behind the project implementation. In fact, the original project drawn up by the Habitat had proposed to construct 203 apartments. However, Mr. Eapen wanted it to be reduced to 100 because he could then only pay the huge amount as kickback demanded by Swapana. However, the project was later revised fixing the number of apartments at 140 after discussion with the LIFE Mission officials.

Sivasankaran’s role

The CBI counsel also submitted, citing the statement of Mr. Eapen given before the CBI, that that it was Mr. Sivasankaran who had asked Mr. Jose to provide all assistance to Mr. Eapen when he and his company officials met Mr. Sivasankaran at his office at the Secretariat. The meeting was arranged by Swapna Suresh.

In fact, Mr. Jose was taken by surprise when he was called to the meeting. He had become aware of the deal only on the morning of the meeting day.

The CBI contended that the agency had not named any officer of the LIFE Mission in its FIR as accused. The investigation was continuing .These officials might become an accused or principal witnesses in the case. At this juncture, it was too early to say that Mr. Jose would be arraigned as accused or a principal witness.

LIFE Mission’s contention

The counsel for the LIFE Mission CEO submitted that it had no role in the selection of the contractors. The project was funded by the UAE and the selection of the contractors was left to the donor. The investigation by the CBI was an abuse of process of the law.

Justice V.G. Arun reserved judgment on the petitions after hearing the arguments of all the parties.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/life-mission-project-mou-an-eyewash-cbi/article32805033.ece
147,2020/10/08,Call for ‘generational shift’ in IUML,"‘More youth representation in legislative bodies will bring in fresh views’

There may be no clamour in the youth wing of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) for more representation in the legislative spheres. But strong sentiments within the Muslim Youth League (MYL) against the party leadership's reluctance to set in motion the 'much needed generational shift' in the party are likely to be articulated more strongly now.

Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader and MLA K.M. Shaji's recent appeal for more representation for party youth leaders in the Assembly and Parliament reflected those sentiments. The MLA, who represents the Azhikode Assembly constituency in Kannur for the second term, has publicly pitched for the youth leadership of the party. More youth representation in legislative bodies would bring in fresh views and opinions, he said.

He has urged the IUML leadership to extend the three-term limit set by the party for party candidates in local body elections to party leaders contesting in Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.

“Fresh views and thoughts are indispensable for a democratic system to be energetic and without the presence of youth leaders who are better informed on issues concerning, say, education and entrepreneurship, legislative discussions risk being run off the mill,” Mr. Shaji told The Hindu when contacted on Thursday.

Clarifying his stand, he said that the three-term limit set for elected party members in the local bodies could be made applicable to incumbent IUML MLAs and MPs. There should be initiatives in the party to ensure generational renewal, he said.

Mr. Shaji’s call, according to IUML circles, will kick off debates within the party and is likely to serve as an impetus for the MYL to mount pressure on the party leadership to field more youth leaders in the next Assembly elections. The IUML, which has strong electoral base in the Malabar region, is the second largest party in the United Democratic Front led by the Congress. A section of the MYL leadership feels that the Congress has ensured adequate representation to young faces in the Assembly.

The MLA is seen as giving voice to the resentment among MYL leaders. The feeling within the youth wing of the party is that even those who had ascended to the top rung on the party ladder after their election to legislative bodies during their young age are not prepared to offer the same electoral prospects to young leaders.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/11rzis/article32809729.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kmshajijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/call-for-generational-shift-in-iuml/article32804963.ece

149,2020/10/08,"Congress, BJP seeks CM’s resignation","CPI(M) State secretariat to counter allegations

The Congress and the BJP on Wednesday sought to use a recent court filing by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to press for the resignation of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on the charge of abetting gold smugglers and economic offenders.

Quoting the Central agency, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said Mr Vijayan was “in the knowledge of” the appointment of UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh as a marketing consultant at the Space Park project under the IT Department.

The deposition has lent credence to the suspicion of the Opposition that gold smugglers and economic offenders had infiltrated Mr. Vijayan's office and basked in his patronage, he said.

Swapna had told the ED that she had met Mr. Vijayan “5 to 6 times in the presence of his former Principal Secretary M. Sivasankar”. The bureaucrat, who controlled the Chief Minister’s Office and was a close confidante, had “illegally recommended” Swapna to the government post when she was an employ of the UAE consulate, Mr. Chennithala said.

He said the ED had revealed that a builder had paid Swapna and others a considerable bribe to bag the UAE-Red Crescent-Life Mission contract to construct dwellings for the poor in Thrissur.

The builder later offset the bribe against the contract amount by reducing the number of apartments from 200 to 140. Finally, the homeless picked up the tab for the government-sanctioned graft, Mr. Chennithala said. He and four UDF leaders marched to the Secretariat to demand Mr. Vijayan's resignation.

BJP president K. Surendran said the ED had exposed Mr. Vijayan's links to economic offenders and traitors. He named two more senior government officials who he said had assisted Swapna. He said Mr. Vijayan had lost the right to continue in office. The BJP would step up its agitation for his resignation.

CPI(M) counters

Meanwhile the CPI(M) said the Congress and BJP had cherry-picked the ED’s statement to portray the government in a bad light.

The ED clearly stated that Mr. Sivasankar was the “point of contact” between the State and the UAE consulate. Moreover, Swapna had told the agency that Mr. Vijayan knew her as secretary to the UAE Consulate general. The CPI(M) State secretariat, which is scheduled to meet here on Friday, was likely to counter the charges.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/igk0n5/article32809666.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UDF-MARCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/congress-bjp-seeks-cms-resignation/article32804764.ece
150,2020/10/08,BJP to intensify protests against govt.,"Will have to rethink on adhering to COVID-19 protocol, says Surendran

BJP State president K. Surendran has said that his party will intensify its agitation against the State government in the wake of the emerging evidence of its involvement in the gold smuggling case, Life Mission corruption and manipulation in the voters’ list.

Addressing a news conference here on Thursday, he said that the government would have to reconsider its restrictions of allowing only five persons to publicly protest in the wake of the COVID-19 spread in the State.

Unlike the Congress-led UDF, the BJP was not a party that succumbed to the decisions of the government, Mr. Surendran said, adding that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had also called him to stop the protests.

He alleged that the government itself was violating the COVID-19 protocol for its own convenience. More than 500 persons participated in a function in which Minister for Devaswom Kadakampally Surendran participated in Thiruvananthapuram recently, he pointed out.

‘CM must clarify’

He said that the Enforcement Directorate probing the money trail behind the gold smuggling through the diplomatic channel had filed a chargesheet exposing the links between the Chief Minister and the key suspect Swapna Suresh. If the Chief Minister did not clarify on this, his silence would be seen as an admission of guilt, Mr. Surendran said.

On the allegation that Union Minister of State V. Muraleedharan had breached protocol norms, Mr. Surendran said it was only to outmanoeuvre the public attention from the ongoing gold smuggling case.

Mahila Morcha secretary Smitha Menon had attended the international meet in her capacity as a PR professional after registering in the media category. Now CPI(M) leaders were behind the cyber propaganda against Mr. Muraleedharan, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bjp-to-intensify-protests-against-govt/article32804661.ece
151,2020/10/08,A mini forest coming up in the Venice of the East,"Miyawaki forest being cultivated on 20 cents in Port Museum compound in Alappuzha

The district cannot boast of a jungle teeming with flora and fauna. It is a land with no wilderness. The only exception is a 14.5 acres of land at Veeyapuram, a proposed reserve forest, which is home to a small number of plant and animal species and a few private forests in small tracts of land.

But things are changing. The Alappuzha municipal area sandwiched between the Arabian sea and Vembanad Lake is set to host a mini forest in the near future. The Kerala Development and Innovation Strategy Council (K-DISC) has joined hands with a consortium involving Thiruvananthapuram-based Nature’s Green Guardians Foundation, Culture Shoppe and Invis Multimedia to create a forest on 20 cents of land on the premises of Port Museum, which is being set up as part of the Heritage Project, using the Miyawaki method.

3,200 saplings

As part of creating the mini forest, 3,200 saplings of 100 species will be planted there. “As the population increases, natural resources are depleting. Our aim is to reinstate the green cover where there is a deficiency of it. Using this model of intense foresting will increase biodiversity and create an ecosystem. Planting operations are in progress and in three years it will take the shape of a dense forest,” says Hari Prabhakaran, Director, Nature’s Green Guardians Foundation.

Indigenous species

Majority of the saplings being planted are of indigenous species. They include medicinal and fruit-bearing plants. Apart from supporting local wildlife, the mini forest will help in sequestration of carbon. The land for planting saplings was prepared by adding cow dung and other organic fertilizers to the soil to make it more fertile.

Miyawaki is a technique introduced by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki that revolutionised urban afforestation by creating dense and native forests. It involves planting several native species in a small area and making it a self-sustaining green space in three to four years.

The K-DISC is funding the programme.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gizrdh/article32804623.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9tval1--forest,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-mini-forest-coming-up-in-the-venice-of-the-east/article32804529.ece
152,2020/10/08,GST compensation cannot be limited to 5 years,"GIFT experts say as long as there is GST there shall be compensation for States

For sustaining cooperative federalism, the Goods and Service Tax (GST) compensation cannot be confined to a limited period of five years, say experts of the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT), an autonomous institution of the State government. They are of the view that as long as there is GST there shall be GST compensation for States.

“The GST Compensation Act is premised on the explicit recognition of the unconditional surrender that the States together have made towards evolving one common market with one tax. Hence, there is reason to believe that in the absence of GST compensation, GST would not have been born,” say K.J. Joseph, Director, and N. Ramalingam, Associate Professor.

Experts say they fail to understand the reason as to how the GST can continue without GST compensation even after five years unless there are mechanisms built in to ensure that the States receive a higher share of the tax revenue.

The States, which together account for around 60% of the combined expenditure of the Centre and the States, have been enticed to compromise with a constitutional guarantee of 14% growth in their tax revenue under GST. Had there been no GST compensation, GST would not have been there for establishing the One Nation, One Tax regime.

The outcome of the GST is that the tax revenue is shared equally between the Centre and the States. Given the equality in the distribution of outcome, the question arises whether the cost of establishing GST has also been equally shared.

The cost is viewed in terms of the pre-GST revenue surrendered by the States and the Centre. The Arvind Subramanian committee report has shown that the revenue forgone by the Centre has been ₹3.28 lakh crore and that by the States ₹3.69 lakh crore. “Our estimate revealed that this amounted to a surrender of 51.8% of the States’ total tax revenue and 28.8% for Centre’s gross tax revenue.”

While in absolute terms the difference is not substantial, in relative terms the surrender by the States is almost twice that of the Centre. GST compensation is the constitutionally paid price for the higher surrender that the States have made, they said.

With the introduction of GST, the 14.5% category goods have been brought under the 12% or 18% category wherein the States’ share being 6% or 9% respectively. Only a few goods were brought under 28%, where in the share of the States is 14%. The States lost 8.5% for those goods brought under 12% and 5.5% in case of those with 18%.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gst-compensation-cannot-be-limited-to-5-years/article32804293.ece
153,2020/10/08,Coronavirus | Children could be prone to multisystem inflammatory syndrome,"Disorder manifests itself around four weeks after COVID caseload peaks

The surge in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks in the State has left open the possibility of multisystem inflammatory syndrome among children, a rare disorder that involves constant fever and extreme inflammation resulting from exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

Public health experts point out that the disease has been found in children in countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. and States such as Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra around four weeks after the caseload peaked there.

K.K. Purushothaman, professor of Paediatrics, Government Medical College, Thrissur, told The Hindu on Thursday that like adults, a large majority of children too could be asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Unless tested properly, its presence would not be revealed. “Earlier, the number of cases was comparatively low. However, the reported caseload has now reached over 2.5 lakh in Kerala. There could be undetected infections too, may be one-third of our total population is already infected. In such a scenario, there is a possibility of children, so far protected owing to their confinement at homes, getting affected,” he said.

It might not manifest now itself, but a couple of weeks later, as seen in the U.S. and the U.K., Dr. Purushothaman said. “The infection may show up in the form of either symptoms or other problems among adults in the first phase. Only in the second phase does it lead to a dip in oxygen levels in blood , hypoxia, and other complications. Among children, there may not be a first phase of infection as most of them are asymptomatic and they may directly enter the second phase,” he noted.

Different symptoms

The symptoms seen in children during this period too are markedly different from adults. “They may have acute abdominal pain, diarrhoea, or vomiting. Skin lesions, enlarged lymph nodes, strawberry tongue, and swollen hands and feet could show up,” he said. A study conducted between May 1 and July 15 in select hospitals in Mumbai revealed 23 cases and one death. Similar research done by the Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital, Chennai, led to the discovery of 19 such cases between May 4 and July 8. It is learnt that a few hospitals in Chennai are now reporting at least one or two cases every day.

“This syndrome, however, can be treated if detected early. Doctors should be alert if they notice the symptoms. All government medical college hospitals have the facilities. Health professionals and associations such as the Indian Medical Association and Indian Academy of Paediatrics should create awareness about it,” Dr. Purushothaman added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fvg3v9/article32807862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tv-inflammatory-syndromecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/children-could-be-prone-to-multisystem-inflammatory-syndrome/article32804204.ece
154,2020/10/08,Fee for self-financing engg. colleges to remain same,"KSFECMA and KCECMA ink deals with government

The fee charged by self-financing engineering/architecture colleges in the State will remain the same for the batch that will commence during the 2020-21 academic year. The government has entered into agreements with the managements on the fee structure and seat allotment.

The Kerala Self-Financing Engineering College Managements Association (KSFECMA) and Kerala Catholic Engineering College Managements Association (KCECMA), which represents 90 and 14 private engineering colleges respectively, have inked the deals with the government.

Retaining the existing seat matrix, the Commissioner for Entrance Examinations (CEE) will allot students to 50% of the seats in the colleges on the basis of a rank list prepared on the basis of merit and reservation guidelines. Of the remaining seats, 35% (out of 50%) will be filled by the managements (under the management quota) with students who figure on the KEAM/JEE entrance list. The remaining 15% can be filled under the Non-Resident Indian (NRI) quota.

Two groups

At colleges functioning under the KSFECMA, the seats filled up by the CEE are further divided into two — lower-income group and others. The annual tuition fee for both the groups will be ₹50,000 each while the latter will incur an annual special fee of ₹25,000. An annual tuition fee of up to ₹99,000 and ₹1.5 lakh will be charged from students who secure admission under the management and NRI quotas respectively. These groups will be required to pay an annual special fee of ₹25,000, besides an interest-free refundable deposit of ₹1.5 lakh.

While an annual fee of ₹75,000 will be charged by the KCECMA-aligned institutions, students except those belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Eligible Communities (OEC) or fishermen community, will be required to make an interest-free refundable deposit of ₹1 lakh. Students admitted under the NRI quota will have to remit up to $7,000 in addition to the fee payable by other candidates. However, they will not be required to pay the refundable sum.

The fee of the SC, ST, and OEC candidates and those hailing from the fishing community will be borne by the government. While allotments will be completed by the CEE by October 31, the students will have to join their allotted colleges by November 4.

The Architecture College Management Association (ACMA), a collective of 27 private architecture college managements, will adhere to a similar seat matrix.

While the annual tuition fee is ₹55,000 for the lower-income group and other categories allotted by the CEE, the latter will also incur an annual special fee of ₹25,000. The management and NRI quota seats will have an annual tuition fee of up to ₹1.375 lakh and ₹2.2 lakh respectively, and the candidates will also be charged a special fee of ₹40,000 every year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fee-for-self-financing-engg-colleges-to-remain-same/article32804175.ece
155,2020/10/08,YouTube video unveils elephant trade,"Forest department take custody of 15 elephants from self-styled trader in Kollam

Boasting about trading 200 elephants in a YouTube video has landed a self-styled elephant trader of Kollam in trouble with the Forest Department booking cases against him for illegal transport and sale of elephants and taking his 15 elephants into custody.

Five cases were booked against V. Shaji of Kaveri Puthenkulam, Kollam; K.S. Rashmi, Kollam; Shinu of Mavelikkara; Manish Nath, Kollam; and a few others for illegally trading 15 captive elephants. The accused were booked for illegally transporting the elephants from other States, keeping the animals without valid documents and trading them. The relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act and the Captive Elephant Management Rules were invoked against them, the officials said.

The department swung into action last month after the video, Puthenkulam Kaveri Park, in which Mr. Shaji stated that he had brought nearly 200 elephants from Assam, Bihar and Andaman and traded them in Kerala, went viral. He claimed to have purchased the elephants, Modi, Lakshmi, Anadapadmanabhan and Rao among others and brought them to the park. The preliminary verification of documents indicated that the elephants, which were in the names of others, were in the custody of Mr. Shaji, said officials.

A special team with over 100 men was formed and searches were carried out in Kollam, Pathanamthitta and Mavelikara. The key accused could not be arrested as he went into hiding. Even though the team had plans to take the possession of the animals, the idea was later dropped and the elephants were left with its keepers after recording its custody.

In another incident, two cases were booked against A.V. Prasanth of Manikandeswaram, Peroorkada, for the illegal trade of elephants. He was arraigned as the first accused in both the First Information Reports filed by the Forest Department at the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court 1, Nedumangad.

In the first case, Mr. Prasanth has been made the accused for illegally bringing an elephant from Uttar Pradesh in violation of the provisions of the Act and Rule and forging documents. In the second case, besides Mr. Prasanth, Bency Shaji, Praveen and Sreejith have been arraigned as the accused. The case is that Ms. Shaji sold the elephant to Mr. Praveen. The animal was then sold to Mr. Sreejith from whom Mr. Prasanth bought it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/twqozp/article32807446.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/elephant,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/youtube-video-unveils-elephant-trade/article32803792.ece

157,2020/10/08,"Come with strong arguments in Lavalin case, Supreme Court tells CBI","Present CM Pinarayi Vjayan was discharged in the case as an accused by Special Court, CBI, Thiruvananthapuram, and Kerala High Court.

The Supreme Court on Thursday told the CBI that it will need to bolster its appeal against Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the SNC Lavalin corruption case with “very strong arguments” as two courts had discharged him and some others of all wrong-doing.

“You know that two courts have concurrently said these persons need not be tried. You will have to come up now with very strong arguments to say they should not be discharged”, Justice U.U. Lalit, heading a three-judge Bench, addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI.

Mr. Vijayan was discharged in the case as an accused by both the Special Court, CBI, in Thiruvananthapuram, and the Kerala High Court.

The CBI has, in its appeal, contended that Mr. Vijayan should face trial in the case.

The case

The corruption case concerns the loss of ₹86.25 crore in the Kerala State Electricity Board’s (KSEB) contract with Lavalin for the renovation and modernisation of Pallivasai, Sengulam and Panniar hydroelectric projects in Idukki district . Mr. Vijayan was the State’s Power Minister then.

The premier investigation agency said Mr. Vijayan travelled to Canada as a “guest” of Lavalin in 1997. It was there, in Canada, he made the “crucial” decision to promote Lavalin, who was a mere consultancy firm retained on fixed-rate basis, from consultants to suppliers.

Discharge not correct: CBI

The CBI has argued that the decision of the Kerala High Court to discharge the Chief Minister was “not correct"".

The court had upheld the discharge of Mr. Vijayan and two former KSEB senior officers - K. Mohanachandran and A. Francis. Mr. Mohanachandran is a former principal secretary, Department of Power, and Mr. Francis, then joint secretary in the same department.

However, three other accused - M. Kasthuriranga Iyer, G. Rajasekharan Nair and R. Sivadasan - were asked to stand trial. Mr. Nair was then Member (Accounts) of the KSEB and Mr. Iyer was Chief Engineer (Generation) in the Board.

The accused who were ordered to stand trial have also appealed to the Supreme Court for parity of treatment.

158,2020/10/08,Woman who posed for ‘Yakshi’ dead,"It was Nafeesa who posed for Kanayi Kunhiraman’s iconic statue’s legs

The woman who had posed in front of celebrated sculptor Kanayi Kunhiraman for the making of world famous Yakshi sculpture at the Malampuzha park, near here, died on Wednesday.

Nafeesa aka Nabeesumma passed away without being acknowledged for her role in the making of the Yakshi.

She was in the news when Kanayi visited her at hospital last year during the golden jubilee celebrations of the Yakshi. Although the government and the Lalithakala Akademi had ignored Nafeesa and the four others who had helped the sculptor during the two years he spent sculpting it from 1967, Kanayi acknowledged her service by paying a visit to her.

The model

The 30-ft-tall sculpture of a nude woman in sitting position has won widespread attention and appreciation not only because of its posture, but also because of its size and figure. When Kanayi modelled the Yakshi’s upper portion, especially the bust, on the nude image of a western woman, it was Nafeesa who posed for the statue’s legs.

Nafeesa’s co-workers Velayudhan and Pazhaniswami recounted how she sat with her skirt raised up to her knees. They said she never had to reveal her body. She had sat in front of the sculptor with her legs stretched out, showing her robust shanks.

Nafeesa was one of the five workers assigned by the Irrigation Department to help Kanayi. Two others had died earlier.

The government had celebrated the statue’s golden jubilee by organising a 12-day Yakshi Yanam programme in February-March last year, by bringing in artists from across the country. But the neglect of those involved in the making of the iconic sculpture had evoked strong criticism.

Felicitation

The Samskara Sahiti, a cultural wing of the Congress, had felicitated the workers when the government insisted that their service would not be acknowledged.

“We do not have to invoke any politics or affiliation when acknowledging the services of those involved in this world class sculpture. It’s a matter of acknowledging a simple human act. Humanity has to find priority here,” said Sahiti district chairman Boban Mattumantha.

The Kudumbashree poverty alleviation and women empowerment mission has rolled out Athijeevanam, a programme to create new livelihoods for at least 15,000 people.

Athijeevanam is being implemented as part of the 100-day action plan of the government.

One of the 100 components of action plan is creating livelihood opportunities for 50,000 people.

Athijeevanam is being organised as part of the Local Employment Assurance Programme (LEAP) of the government that aims at finding livelihood for at least five persons in every local self-government institution.

Launched on September 25, this mission mode campaign will come to an end on October 15. Creating awareness of Athijeevanam in all neighbourhood groups and making those interested to register online is under way. So far, nearly 12,000 people have registered.

The registration is followed by a general orientation training on the opportunities available.

This has kicked off in some districts. Once the training is completed, a two-day ‘Entrepreneurship Development Programme’ will be organised on the various enterprises and how to start them. Classes on each sector will follow. These will give an idea about the interests of each person, and accordingly, skill training will be provided to them. They will also be made familiar with the various kinds of support provided by the Kudumbashree.

Microenterprise conveners, area development society (ADS) members, and resource persons will explain the subject at neighbourhood group meetings.

164,2020/10/08,TCCI for popularising capital’s brand value,"CM’s intervention sought for branding projects

The Trivandrum Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) has urged Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to intervene to ensure consistent city/region branding and to rename existing infrastructure projects and institutions based in the State capital.

“One of the key prerequisites in attracting new businesses and related development to the region is consistent city/region branding,” TCCI president S. N. Raghuchandran Nair and secretary Abraham Thomas said in a letter to the Chief Minister on Wednesday.

Ideally when projects are launched in any district or region they should be branded by the name of the city or district which are presently being followed in other places in the State.

“Though Thiruvananthapuram is known world over, we find that there is no consistency in branding projects housed in the capital in this manner. This needs correction and renaming through your intervention,” they said.

Technopark

Instead of Technopark Kazhakuttam, Thiruvananthapruam, the premier IT park should be known as Technopark Thiruvananthapuram, it said.

The TCCI has said the Geenfield Stadium or Sports Hub Kariyavattom should be renamed as Thiruvananthapuram International Stadium, Kariyavattom.

165,2020/10/08,When learning meets technology,"Digital learning has come into its own in the age of lockdowns and social distancing

As recently as a decade ago, the concept of “online education” was met with scepticism from parents and students alike. Spending a good deal of money on a course that had you nodding in front of a computer screen sounded preposterous. Today, however, digital learning is now becoming the norm, especially in the age of pandemic and social distancing.

While it lets students be in control of their learning, with lesser distractions and more certification options and is also cost-effective, it is still an evolving discipline. Here’s what the future of online education looks like:

Gamification: Lately, the word has been on everyone’s lips. It is the process of introducing game elements — VR, avatars, simulations and task-oriented approaches — to convert learning into a fun-filled game. Learners can benefit from increased engagement and better retention, according to a 2011 study from the University of Colorado.

Mobile learning: Cheap smartphones and affordable data packs have galvanised India’s digital movement. With learners’ convenience in mind, courses will be built to suit the mobile interface, allowing e-learning to reach households without computers.

Microlearning: Traditional methods of learning and pedagogy don’t take into account the human brain’s retentive capacity. To reduce cognitive load, e-learning has been focusing on microlearning, or converting information into easy, “bite-sized pieces.” These nuggets obviate the need for long-course formats and can be easily consumed by learners on their mobiles.

Big data: It lets learning systems understand the needs of individual users and brings a personal touch to the learning experience. Assessing the data also helps improve the courses and tackle the challenges almost immediately.

Artificial Intelligence: It has been transforming e-learning by integrating smart content, smart tutoring systems and content analytics and bridging the gaps. Many fear that introducing AI into learning may make human instructors redundant. But AI will, in fact, aid teachers in understanding the learners’ competencies and allow them to craft the best instructional approach. AI can also entirely free them from time-consuming admin work.

Despite all this, we are only beginning to scratch the surface of how technology can revolutionise digital learning.

166,2020/10/08,The cast of ‘The Right Stuff’: ‘A criminally untold story of America’s first astronauts’,"Patrick J. Adams, James Lafferty and others about bringing to life the iconic space saga of The Mercury 7, through the upcoming series

Based on the bestselling book by Tom Wolfe, The Right Stuff is a drama series that shuttles into the realities of one of the first-ever missions of NASA. An inspirational look at the early days of the U.S. Space Program and the iconic story of America’s first astronauts, the Mercury 7, the series also derives material from the 1983 movie of the same name.

The Mercury 7 have been widely credited with creating a new profession in the United States, and establishing the image of the American astronaut for decades to come as a real-life superhero. These seven original American astronauts were Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton.

Essaying these legendary names are the likes of Patrick J. Adams (Suits), Jake McDorman (Limitless), James Lafferty (One Tree Hill) and many others part of a huge cast of talented actors taking on the roles of the astronauts, their wives, family members and others in the iconic space program.

On a Zoom call before the series premieres, the cast and makers of The Right Stuff find time to chat with us.

An inspirational tale that transcends time and age

Starting off the discussion, Patrick J. Adams says that he read this book when he was 14 years old and had been in love with the source material since. “When I heard they were making a series, I jumped at the opportunity and wanted to be a part of it. That was even more hardened when I read Mark Lafferty’s incredible script for the pilot. The story of the Mercury 7 has been sort of criminally untold other than the movie, which was great.”

He adds that he was a little overwhelmed by how much research he found on his character John Glenn, who was the first American to orbit Earth. “John Glenn’s life is incredibly well-documented. Him and his wife Annie were children of the Depression, so they kept everything. All of that has been stored in archives at Ohio State University, hundreds of boxes of materials, photos, interviews, receipts, invitations. But the thing that surprised me most was that he was a poet; finding his poetry written in his own hand on a piece of paper, stuff like that is so unbelievably helpful to the processor who’s trying to get into his head,” Patrick recalls.

Micah Stock, Jake McDorman, Aaron Staton, Michael Trotter, Patrick J. Adams, Colin O’Donoghue and James Lafferty

Answering a question on how it was for actors to live in that different time period and in that different America on sets, James Lafferty, who plays the role of Scott Carpenter in the series, says, “One of the major things that was going on at that time is that the country was sort of united in their fear of this existential threat of nuclear war with Russia; that was something that was on everyone’s mind. Then as the decade moved on, it became about civil rights as well. I think any time an entire country is scared or fearful about the future under any circumstances, there’s gonna be this feeling of like, okay, we’ve gotta pull together to figure out how we get through this.”

He adds that one of the big challenges in playing the role was trying to be “period-accurate” in terms of mannerisms and speech: “I think it was a much more rigid time and people were a lot more composed and polite and deliberate in their speech.”

Complicated characters, complicated men

Producer Jennifer Davisson of Appian Way — founded by Leonardo DiCaprio — talks about how the project initially got underway. “So for us, obviously, DiCaprio is my partner and we look for projects that, at the center, have really complicated characters, complicated men. A lot of them are great men, but you kind of look at them and say, “What did they sacrifice for that greatness, personally and professionally?” While we were looking at someone else in the Space Program, we actually were like, wait a second, wait a second, here’s seven great, complicated characters. So we jumped all over it.”

How much pressure were all the actors under to bring this story to life?

Colin O’Donoghue, who essays the role of Gordon Cooper, recalls how they managed to go to the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing, which is when the reality of the project sunk in. “We were sort of sitting at the front and they were talking about all the astronauts who were there in the audience and then they said, “And we got the cast of The Right Stuff!” and we had to kinda do a wave like that. I suddenly went, ohh, okay, okay. (laughs) But like I said already, the script is so good, it was really incredible to get to play a real-life sort of American hero,” he grins.

Why the concept of space continues to awe

Before this project, did they have any favorite space films which they took inspiration from? How much did shooting at a location like Cape Canaveral inspire them?

Says Nora Zehetner (Annie Glenn in the series), “Cape Canaveral was really cool.We got to do a tour when we first got there, and they showed us where different things were shot and obviously where the launches happened. My favorite fictional space movie is really, really embarrassing but I really enjoy Armageddon, and I can watch it over and over!”

John Glenn played by Patrick J. Adams, with Annie Glenn played by Nora Zehetner

Eloise Mumford, who is Trudy Cooper on the show, adds, “Space is so much bigger than all of us. I mean, literally, but also emotionally and just as a concept, being close to something so grand, it infused it into all of our energies as we approached this project.”

“There is a nostalgia for that time, which is very prevalent and yet, I think completely ignores just the lack of access for people of color and women; our show is a really interesting exploration of that. We have to be brutally honest about that, as a culture, to say that we accomplished incredible things at that point —we still are — and yet, they could have been so much more incredible if they were more inclusive. We have to fight for that as we continue forward,” she concludes.

167,2020/10/08,David Fincher’s ‘Mank’ to premiere December 4 on Netflix,"The biopic, starring Gary Oldman in the titular role, is based on the life of ‘Citizen Kane’ screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz

Upcoming biographical drama “Mank”, based on the life of “Citizen Kane” screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz, will be released on Netflix on December 4.

According to Collider, the black-and-white film, featuring Oscar winner Gary Oldman in the title role, will head to the digital platform a month after it starts playing in select theatres.

The biopic, helmed by David Fincher, centres around Mankiewicz and his battles with “Citizen Kane” director and star Orson Welles over screenplay credit for the 1941 cinematic masterpiece.

“Mank” is based on the script by Fincher’s father, Jack, who had written the draft before his death in 2003.

“The Souvenir” star Tom Burke plays Welles, with Amanda Seyfried starring as yesteryear actor Marion Davis, Lily Collins as Mankiewicz’s secretary Rita Alexander and Tuppence Middleton as the scribe’s wife Sara Mankiewicz.

The film would be Fincher’s first feature directorial since 2014’s “Gone Girl”.

Fincher will back the film alongside producing partner Cean Chaffin and Douglas Urbanski.

Considered to be one of the best films of all time, “Citizen Kane” managed to win just one Academy Award, which was for best original screenplay.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/g4jr/article32802832.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MankFirstLook01-1280x720,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/david-finchers-mank-to-premiere-december-4-on-netflix/article32802833.ece
168,2020/10/08,"Love and poetry, the muse for lyricists","Does a broken heart inspire great poetry or is it just a myth?

When Anusuya Singh Estevez, the gifted daughter of Gurbaksh Singh Preetlari, passed away last month in Merida, Venezuela at the age of 84, it created ripples in the literary circuit. Followers of Shiv Kumar Batalvi surfaced on the social media and described Anusuya as Batalvi’s unrequited love, who inspired him to write the timeless gem, ‘Ik kudi jida naam mohabbat gum hai’ (A girl, whose name is love, is lost).

Composer Amit Trivedi used Batalvi’s verse to mesmerising effect in Udta Punjab. Sung by Shahid Mallaya with versions by Diljeet Dosanjh and Alia Bhatt, the song became the defining feature of the film and continues to be a hit with teenagers.

Does a broken heart let one pen great poetry or is it just a myth circulated by fans, and, at times, by writers themselves. There are multiple narratives about how the passionate relationship between Anusuya and Shiv was killed before it blossomed in Preet Nagar, an estuary of liberal thoughts created by Gurbaksh Singh, where Eastern and Western ideas met and found a voice in the much-sought-after magazine Preetlari.

Old-timers say it was a Nehruvian experiment against a conflict-ridden world where creative personalities such as Balraj and Bhisham Sahni, Sobha Singh and Balwant Gargi met and discussed their work. It is said that it was here that the platonic romance between Sahir Ludhianvi and Amrita Pritam also took shape.

Noted Litterateur Amrita Pritam.

Read the text

Senior critic of Punjabi literature. Prof. Krantipal. advises followers to read the text and to not go by the stories associated with it. “By doing so, you are limiting the vastness of the thought of the writer,” he says, adding that it’s usually teenagers on the cusp of adulthood who are drawn to the incredibly handsome Batalvi, whose stage presence remains unrivalled.

Most writers of romance in Punjab, he says, were inspired by the unfulfilled romance of Shirin-Farhad and Sohini-Mahiwal and Shiv was no different. “According to me, he was not inspired by just one woman or just one situation,” says Prof. Krantipal, reminding me of Shiv’s interview with the BBC, which is available on YouTube.

In the interview, when he is asked of love and heartbreak, he denies the idea of one image, one love and says, in fact, that it was a combination of experiences and the class structure of Indian society that influenced his poetry. He goes on to say he could not make a complete image of his muse. “It was somebody’s lips, somebody else’s feet that inspired me to write.” But he does admit that every intellectual is dying a slow death. The youngest to win the Sahitya Akademi Award, Batalvi died of liver problems at the age of 35.

In the case of Sahir-Amrita, there is evidence that Sahir Ludhianvi did write at least one song for her that was later used in Bharat Bhushan-starrer Dooj Ka Chand (1964). Akshay Manwani, Sahir’s biographer, says that in her autobiography Raseedi Ticket, Amrita, who was besotted with Sahir for a long time, mentions the evening when she along with Imroz, her live-in partner, went to meet Sahir in his hotel in Delhi. That night, she says, Sahir called up at midnight and sang the nazm, ‘Mere saathi khali jaam’, referring to the empty glasses on his table in which the three had been drinking whiskey that night.

Sahir ludhianvi

Referring to the conversation, Amrita writes that Sahir told her over the phone, “There are still three glasses lying on the table. By turn, I am sipping from each one of them, and writing.” It resulted in the popular song, ‘Mehfil se uth jaane waalon tum logon par kya ilzam, tum abaad gharon ki vasi main awaara aur badnam,’ composed by Roshan and sung by Mohammed Rafi.

The passing caravan

As for stories around Sahir writing ‘Chalo ek baar phir ajnabi ban jayen hum dono’ (Hamraaz, 1967) for singer Sudha Malhotra, Manwani says it is in the domain of gossip. “I asked Sudha Malhotra and she denied that the song was written for her. These are urban legends that fans hold on to with great relish and when somebody clarifies that there is no actual proof, the followers feel devastated,” he chuckles.

On the same lines, it is said that poet Gopal Das Neeraj wrote, ‘Carvan guzar gaya gubar dekhte rahe’ when he felt desolate after watching the marriage procession of his beloved pass by. Years later, the song was composed by Roshan and sung by Mohammed Rafi in Nayi Umar Ki Nayi Fasal (1966). When this journalist once asked the poet about the story behind the song, he only said that karuna (compassion) is an essential ingredient of his life and the song is one of the better examples of it. He was not too happy with its picturisation though.

The story of poet Asrar Ul Haq Majaz is no different. As handsome as Neeraj and Shiv, he was also a darling of the stage with a huge female fan following. Like them, he also faced heartbreak and wrote the nazm, ‘Ae gham-e-dil kya karoon, ae vehashate dil kya karoon’ (Oh sad heart, what shall I do? Oh frustrated heart, what shall I do?), titled ‘Awaara’ by him.

Many years later, it was composed by Sardar Malik and used in Shammi Kapoor’s Thokar (1953). The film flopped, but the song lives on, courtesy Talat Mahmood’s voice.

Suhaib Sherwani who co-produced a feature film on the life of Majaz says the Lucknow-based poet had suicidal tendencies and found himself a misfit in Bombay where many of his progressive writer friends had migrated.

Guru Dutt in ‘Pyaasa’

It is said that Guru Dutt’s Pyaasa also had elements of his life. In fact, in the scene where Vijay (Guru Dutt) is serving drinks before a poetic soiree, a lanky young man with wavy hair recites a couplet:

Roodad-e-gham-ulfat unhe kya kehte aur kyoon kehte

Ik harf bhi na nikla honthon se, aur aankhon main aansoon aa gaye

(What sad love stories shall I tell her and how. Before I could utter a word, I saw tears in her eyes) The couplet is taken from a Majaz’s ghazal and sets the tone for ‘Jaane woh kaise log the jinke pyaar ko pyaar mila.’

As Majaz was once friendly with lyricist Sahir and scriptwriter Abrar Alvi, it is said that the couplet and the image of the young poet was their tribute to the poet who passed away in 1955, two years before Pyaasa made it to theatres.

Wine and woman

Sherwani, who taught English Literature at Aligarh Muslim University, says the image of the poet was not necessarily of Majaz. “It reflected a global trend after World War II when creative souls were questioning where humanity was headed.”

Wine and woman, he says, are metaphors in Urdu poetry which should not be taken literally. “Many eminent poets resisted the film world because it often does a literal translation of their words through images. It is like legends and myths which are essentially meant to explain human behaviour and have a spiritual value but the ignorant treat them as mere stories.”

However, over the years, he says, it has been proven that images can wear off but verse continues to evoke new meanings for a new generation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/phbn0s/article32802767.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09frAnusuyaSinghjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/in-search-of-a-muse/article32802771.ece
169,2020/10/08,"'Colour Photo': Sandeep Raj and Suhas, friends who dared to dream big","Ahead of their film, friends Sandeep Raj and Suhas share their journey from making one-minute videos to finding a foothold in Telugu cinema

Actor Suhas and director Sandeep Raj grew up in Vijayawada, in nearby localities. But they didn’t know each other until the love for cinema brought them together in Hyderabad, years later. The Telugu film Colour Photo, which will stream on Aha from October 23, marks Sandeep’s debut as director and Suhas’s first as the protagonist.

Colour Photo turns its gaze on colour, class and caste differences that come in the way of romance between the characters played by Suhas and Chandini Chowdary. The story begins in 1997 in a semi-urban scenario and the film was shot in locales near Vijayawada.

Metaphor of societal hypocrisy Talking about actor Sunil as the antagonist, Sandeep says, “Imagine giving a human form to the hypocrisy of the parents and society that stand between the lead characters. Sunil’s role embodies those hypocrisies.”

“I like films that reflect a region’s culture,” says Sandeep. A Telugu film buff, he also looks out for other language films that capture region-specific ethos, “like the Tamil films made by Vetrimaran, or the Malayalam film Kumbalangi Nights.”

When the film’s co-producer Sai Rajesh outlined the story of an introverted dark-skinned guy falling in love with a fair-skinned, intelligent young woman and wanted to address class and caste differences, Sandeep loved the idea and wrote the screenplay. “In the 25 days I spent writing, I visualised locales that would make the film look authentic. The Machilipatnam beach and Krishna University building are some places where time seems to stand still,” says Sandeep.

Setting the story in the late 90s, before the mobile phone boom, helped Sandeep explore the yearning of the two lead characters: “During the lockdown, many of us stayed connected through video calls. Imagine the 90s. If parents opposed a boy meeting a girl, they wouldn’t be able to interact even if they lived in adjacent lanes,” says Sandeep.

Video route to cinema

Comedy has been Suhas’ forte; he shot into the limelight in 2015 through his YouTube videos and then collaborated with Sandeep to develop video content for Chai Bisket website and YouTube channel.

Sandeep and Suhas began with comedy. “We first wanted people to watch our content. Once we built a substantial subscriber base, we explored other genres,” recalls Suhas.

Before his stint with Chai Bisket, when pursuing B.Sc Computer Science in Vijayawada, Suhas enacted one-act plays, memes and skits. He then moved to Hyderabad and tried his luck in the movies, in vain: “I loved cricket and cinema as a child. In college, I also choreographed dance performances and thought I could be a choreographer in cinema. I discovered my love for acting later.”

Sandeep’s focus was on drama and cultural activities during his B.Tech days and he was a huge fan of S S Rajamouli. On a whim, he arrived in Hyderabad and auditioned for Baahubali in 2013. “I was just 21 and didn’t fit the bill of a well-built guy that the Baahubali team was looking for,” he recalls.

However, his humorous posts on Facebook got noticed by Chai Bisket website. “They wanted me to write and were willing to pay, so I took it up. We began with one-minute videos and slowly increased the duration. Our videos became popular,” recalls Sandeep.

Moment of recognition

A turning point for both Suhas and Sandeep was their short film Athiti, which went viral. The Telugu film industry took notice.

Suhas was offered character roles with a touch of comedy. He began with Padi Padi Leche Manasu, but with Majili he got noticed. A host of films followed — Agent Sai Srinivasa Athreya, Dear Comrade, and more recently Uma Maheshwara Ugra Roopasya.

Meanwhile, Sandeep got writing opportunities. He has co-written the screenplay of the forthcoming film Aakashavani with director Ashwin Gangaraju, and penned the dialogues for Nagesh Kukunoor’s Telugu film Good Luck Sakhi.

Sandeep and Suhas’s collaboration for Colour Photo happened at the insistence of Sai Rajesh: “He said Suhas would be apt as the hero. I hadn’t thought of my friend as a hero until then,” Sandeep confesses.

Suhas was jittery. He was doing well as a comic actor and the money was decent too: “I was scared that I will lose opportunities trying my luck as the hero,” he says.

He and his wife went on a short trip to Tirupati. Contemplating on the Tirumala hills, Suhas decided to take the plunge: “I took a risk moving to Hyderabad from Vijayawada, why not take another risk with this film? More importantly, I loved the story,” Suhas reasons.

Suhas is counting down days for the digital release and Sandeep is eager that the film reaches a wide audience: “It would have been great to have a theatrical release. But given the scenario, I want people to watch this intense story wherever they are, without the fear of COVID-19 in a crowded environment,” says Sandeep.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/gm1l1f/article32802365.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Colour-Photo-7,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sandeep-raj-and-suhas-friends-who-dared-to-dream-big/article32802366.ece
170,2020/10/08,"‘David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet’ review: A powerful, poignant wake-up call","The documentary, through the eyes of the 94-year naturalist, educates us on how steeply and quickly the planet has changed over his lifetime

It is the early 2000s. My grandmother’s quaint tile-roof house in a small coastal village in Kerala, surrounded by stretches of coconut, mango, cashew and guava trees, is my summer vacation destination. It’s simply serene, sunny, and green. At night, the sound of chirping crickets, hooting owls and the occasional jackal howl kept us bright-eyed kids company. Today, almost years after my grandma passed away, all one sees there are rows of fancy two-storeyed houses.

David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet is a similar “witness statement”. The story through the eyes of a 94-year naturalist educates us on how steeply and quickly the planet has changed over his lifetime.

The documentary opens with him standing in a deserted building with broken walls and shattered glass on the floor. He is in Ukraine where the Chernobyl nuclear plant tragedy happened in 1986. Though the catastrophe had an impact across Europe, he says that, “the true tragedy of our times is still unfolding, barely noticeable from day to day: the loss of biodiversity.”

Astounding nature photography accompanies his narration. Using archive footage of his work, he describes the damage human beings have inflicted over the last 94 years. Shots of lush rainforests with birds and butterflies are followed by chainsaws cutting down the trees. You see thriving coral habitats with colourful fishes and then bleached white dead corals, due to a result of ocean warming and gutted frozen fish; a glimpse of our overfishing over the years.

The most upsetting is the story of the destruction of rainforests of Borneo, which was replaced by rows of oil palms. This destroyed the habitat of the orangutans. “Orangutan mothers have to spend 10 years with their young, teaching them which fruits are worth eating. Without this training, they would not complete their role in dispersing seeds, and the future generation of many trees would be at risk,” says Attenborough.

Though nature takes time and energy to craft itself, humans have caused its collapse single-handedly. If changes continue at this rate, he notes that by 2100, the world would be almost four degrees warmer and a sixth mass extinction would be underway.

Every few minutes, we are shown a table depicting the world population, carbon in the atmosphere, and the percentage of remaining wilderness starting from 1926 — the year Attenborough was born — to 2020.

The last half an hour is an outliner for what can be done to reduce our carbon footprints, how to be sustainable, and a reminder that, “if we take care of nature, nature will take care of us.”

It is a wake-up call not just for individuals, but policymakers, governments across the globe, and a prescribed watch for climate change deniers.

Colin Butfield, WWF’s Executive Producer for the film, says in a release: “For decades, David has brought the natural world to the homes of audiences worldwide, but there has never been a more significant moment for him to share his own story and reflections. This film coincides with a monumental year for environmental action as world leaders make critical decisions on nature and climate. It sends a powerful message from the most inspiring and celebrated naturalist of our time.”

A gratifying full circle is made when the directors zoom out from the shattered building near Chernobyl Plant to show us that the wild has started to reclaim the city where over 50,000 people once lived. There will be no silver bullet to solve this crisis, but there is hope that nature will surely heal and restore if we give it the urgent attention it needs.

Production on “Jurassic World: Dominion” has been halted for two weeks after multiple people involved with the production team tested positive for the coronavirus.

The development came one day after Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment pushed the release of the movie back by a year to June 10, 2022, because of uncertainties surrounding the theatrical calendar due to the pandemic.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, a Universal spokesperson said owing to the “small amount of positive tests for COVID-19”, the filming has been temporarily paused.

“Late last night, we were informed that the ‘Jurassic World: Dominion’ production experienced a small amount of positive tests for COVID-19.

“Even though subsequent tests proved negative this morning, due to our rigid protocols and to ensure that the safety and well-being of our entire cast and crew is paramount at all times, those who initially tested positive are currently self-isolating, as are those who they have come into contact with. As a result filming has been temporarily paused and will resume in accordance with established safety guidelines,” the spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday.

Colin Trevorrow, director of the film, also took to Twitter to react to the news of production shutdown.

“Woke up to the news we had a few positive Coronavirus tests on ‘Jurassic World: Dominion’ All tested negative shortly after, but due to our safety protocols we’re going to pause for two weeks. Back soon,” he wrote, alongside a picture of a dinosaur baby figurine wearing a mask.

“Dominion”, which has about three weeks left on production in the UK, was among the major Hollywood projects whose production scheduled was impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. It resumed production in July after all activities were put on hold in the March.

Lead cast Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are coming back for the third film in the “Jurassic World” series. The film will also feature original stars of 1993’s “Jurassic Park” such as Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill.

Trevorrow is directing from a script he co-wrote with Emily Carmichael. He will also executive produce the film with Steven Spielberg, the “Jurassic Park” director.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/s74b2i/article32800689.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JurassicWorldDominionPoster,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jurassic-world-dominion-suspends-production-after-several-covid-19-cases/article32800690.ece

174,2020/10/08,Congress to hold rally in Tiruvannamalai on October 11 against farm Acts,"The Tamil Nadu Congress Committee will hold a massive rally against the three Farm legislations in Tiruvannamalai on October 11 in which former Union Minister P. Chidambaram and top leaders of the TNCC will participate. The party will also release a booklet on why the Congress is opposing these Farm legislations.

Why the hurry?

“When farmers organisations or opposition parties had not put forth any representations [for such legislations], what was the Central government’s hurry to pass the three Bills in Parliament without consulting the State governments? For whose benefit were these passed? The BJP does not have any answer to these questions. These three legislations are integrated with one another and will destroy the livelihood of farmers,” TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said in a statement on Thursday.

Mr. Alagiri said in the past six years, contrary to the BJP’s 2014 election manifesto promise of ensuring 50% higher prices for produce above MSP and doubling farmers’ income by 2022, farmers have been getting less than MSP and have been incurring losses, increasing their debt burden.

The three legislations encourage private enterprises in agriculture, and farmers will lose out by not even getting the Minimum Support Price, he said terming it as a big betrayal by the Modi government to the farmers in the country.

Mr. Alagiri said the Congress was protesting across the country to protect farmers and will hold a rally on October 11 in Tiruvannamalai against the legislations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/botbir/article32807137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09ALAGIRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/congress-to-hold-rally-in-tiruvannamalai-on-october-11-against-farm-acts/article32807138.ece
175,2020/10/08,‘Consider slain SI’s son for job on compassionate grounds’,"HC disposes of plea filed by son of police officer killed in 2010

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to consider the representation for appointment on compassionate grounds made by V. Ashok Kumar, son of Sub-Inspector of Police R. Vetrivel, who was hacked to death in 2010 in a case of mistaken identity.

Vetrivel was attacked with a bomb and hacked to death by a gang in Alwarkurichi (now in newly created Tenkasi district) over a family feud involving another SI, Sivasubramanian. The incident had sparked an outrage after it was said that two Ministers who were at the spot failed to help Vetrivel when he was bleeding profusely. However, this was denied by the Ministers.

The petitioner said that following his father’s demise, his mother was appointed as an Office Assistant on compassionate grounds. However, she did not take up the job as she had to look after him and his sister, who were in Class VIII and Class IV respectively.

Instead, she sent a representation asking the State to consider the petitioner for appointment once he turned major. He said that he was an engineering graduate now and made a representation in 2018 for appointment on compassionate grounds. But, there was no response from the government yet.

Hearing the plea, Justice Krishnan Ramasamy directed the State to consider the representation sent by the petitioner on merits within four weeks, and disposed of the petition.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/consider-job-for-slain-sis-son-on-compassionate-grounds-madurai-high-court/article32806332.ece
176,2020/10/08,"Have you stopped insisting upon e-pass for inter, intra State travel, Madras HC asks T.N. Govt","The petitioner, K.R. Ezhil Nadhi, contended that such insistence on e-passes amounted to curtailing free movement of citizens.

The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to clarify by Friday as to whether the requirement of people having to obtain e-passes for both intra State as well as inter State travel, in order to control the spread of COVID-19, had been given up or not.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan to obtain instructions from the authorities concerned and inform the court since there was no clarity on the issue so far.

The direction was issued during the hearing of a writ petition, filed last month, challenging the State government’s August 31 lockdown extension order which stated that the insistence on obtaining e-passes for travel would continue for one more month in Tamil Nadu.

The petitioner, K.R. Ezhil Nadhi, contended that such insistence on e-passes amounted to curtailing free movement of citizens. It was also argued that the State government had no authority to do so since the Union Home Ministry had permitted travel without passes.

When the case was listed again on Thursday, the petitioner’s counsel told the court that the State government had issued yet another order on September 30 extending the limited lockdown by one more month. However, this order had no mention about e-passes.

Therefore, nothing much would survive for adjudication in the writ petition if the State government informs the court that it had stopped insisting upon e-passes for travel, he said. The SGP, on the other hand, urged the court to grant him some time to obtain instructions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/x5vbw6/article32786982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7THHC-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/have-you-stopped-insisting-upon-e-pass-for-inter-intra-state-travel-madras-hc-asks-tn-govt/article32806064.ece
177,2020/10/08,HC orders re-post mortem of Saptur youth’s body,"The brother of the deceased had filed a petition

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday ordered exhumation and re-post mortem of the body of K. Ramesh, 20, from Saptur, who died allegedly due to custodial torture. The court directed that the re-post mortem should be conducted by medical experts from Tirunelveli Medical College and Hospital.

The court was hearing the petition filed by Santhosh, brother of Ramesh. It is said that their elder brother Idhayakani had eloped with a relative girl, and her family filed a complaint with Saptur police.

The petitioner alleged that they were subjected to torture by the police on a regular basis in the name of inquiry. The police did not even spare his mother. Their mobile phones were also seized by the police, he alleged.

The petitioner said at 7 p.m. on September 16, Sub-Inspector Jeyakannan, constable Puthiaraja and two others picked up Ramesh from their house. The next day, Ramesh was found hanging from a tree in a nearby hillock, he said.

The family alleged that Ramesh was tortured to death. Though it was initially assured that the post mortem would be conducted at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), Madurai, it was conducted at Usilampatti Government Hospital, he said.

The petitioner’s family was called to cremate the body. Since it was an unnatural death, the body could not be kept in the house and it was buried on the same night. Having serious doubts over the conduct of the post mortem, the family wanted a re-post mortem.

Justice G.R. Swaminathan took a serious view of the fact that the autopsy was not done by a regular forensic team. The allegation of custodial death was made in the very first instance. The FIR itself referred to that, the judge said.

The authorities ought to have taken the body either to Government Theni Medical College or the GRH. “I fail to understand why the post mortem was done in a hurried manner at Usilampatti GH,” the judge said.

Justice Swaminathan observed that what was done could not be called a forensic autopsy. The court took into account that though the post mortem was done for one hour and claimed to be videographed, only video clippings running for seven minutes were available. The judge directed that the second post mortem could be done at the burial site itself and it should be videographed. The case was adjourned till October 12.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-orders-re-post-mortem-of-saptur-youths-body-madurai/article32805651.ece
178,2020/10/08,TN Electricity Regulatory Commission decides to continue existing norms for banking wind energy,"The Commission said on account of the unprecedented situation due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has decided not to disturb the current position on the banking facility

The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) has decided to allow the continuation of existing norms on banking facilities for wind energy projects, much to the relief of the industry.

In its recent wind tariff order, which came into effect from October 7 and is valid till March 31, 2022, TNERC said on account of the unprecedented situation due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, where several restrictions were in place on the movement of the public and on opening of offices etc., and the gradual slowdown in economic activity, it has decided not to disturb the current position on the banking facility.

The banking facility allows captive wind power generators to sell surplus power to distribution companies. Through the facility, wind power producers feed the electricity generated by their wind mills into the State grid, and draw the power for captive use within the banking period.

The banking facility has remained a contentious issue for a long time, with state utility, the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) urging its withdrawal, and wind energy developers wanting it to be continued.

TNERC said the banking period would continue for 12 months from April 1 to March 31 of the succeeding year for projects commissioned on or before March 31, 2018. The applicable banking charges shall be 14% in kind. For projects commissioned on or after April 1, 2018, the facility of banking of energy shall be for a period of one month, it added.

TNERC has decided to retain levy of transmission, wheeling and scheduling and system operation charges at 50% of the applicable charges for conventional power, notified from time to time, for projects commissioned under the normal category. It has also decided to retain levy of cross-subsidy surcharge at 60% of that applicable to conventional power.

TNERC also said procurement of wind power by Tangedco to meet its renewable purchase obligations, shall be through competitive bidding by following all prescribed procedures.

Noting that the tariff regime has shifted to competitive bidding from a feed-in-tariff regime, TNERC did not suggest any benchmark tariff.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-electricity-regulatory-commission-decides-to-continue-existing-norms-for-banking-wind-energy/article32803214.ece

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday wrote to his counterpart in Karnataka B.S. Yediyurappa, urging him to fill up vacancies of Tamil teachers in government and aided schools in the neighbouring State. He also insisted on reopening such schools that were recently closed.

In his letter, Mr. Palaniswami also asked the Karnakata CM to grant recognition/permission to open new private schools with Tamil as a medium of instruction. He also insisted on the restoration of Tamil schools, which have been converted into other language schools.

Mr. Palaniswami’s letter followed a representation received from the Karnataka Tamil School and College Teachers Association, which indicated that there were many vacancies of Tamil teachers in government-run and aided schools and that the Karnataka government had not given approval for opening of new private Tamil schools.

Tamilians have been contributing significantly to the all-round economic development of the State of Karnataka.

183,2020/10/08,"COVID-19 cases dip in Cuddalore in September, district administration says","District Collector Chandra Sekhar Sakhamuri said an effective surveillance system, an increase in fever camps and early identification and treatment has helped bring down the cases

Aggressive testing, door-to-door surveillance and an increase in fever camps seems to have brought down the number of COVID-19 positive cases in Cuddalore district in September.

According to statistics available with the district administration, at the end of July, 11 % of the total 2,403 rural habitations had active cases. Of these, 53 habitations had more than three cases. Similarly, in urban areas comprising of 3,589 streets in 16 town panchayats and five municipalities, 8.5 % of the areas had active cases. Of these, 41 areas had more than three cases.

The number of active cases peaked in August at the end of which 25 % of the rural habitations and 16 % of urban areas had active cases. As many as 117 rural habitations and 97 areas had more than three cases.

The district administration conducted a door-to-door survey by roping in 2,300 booth-level officers to identify persons with COVID-19 symptoms and co-morbidities.

“We identified current and emerging hotspots and put in place an effective surveillance system. This included appointment of officers for each containment zone. The number of fever camps were increased from 1,096 in July to 4,807 in August. Door-to-door testing was also increased and residents with symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) were taken to the nearest labs for testing,” Collector Chandra Sekhar Sakhamuri told The Hindu.

The testing rate was increased and as many as 47,870 swab samples were taken in August, as against 23,995 in July.

Coordinated steps to bring down the active cases in addition to early identification and treatment has helped bring down the cases in both rural and urban areas, Mr. Sakhamuri said.

Due to the effective steps taken, the number of active cases registered a dip in September. The number of active rural habitations came down to 307 (12.7 %) with only 39 habitations having more than three cases. Similarly, in urban areas, 343 streets (9.5 %) had active cases of which 49 had more than three cases. The number of containment zones also reduced from 100 to 79.

184,2020/10/08,HC judge Kirubakaran concerned over India’s dependency on China for medicinal ingredients,"He says it acts as a handicap in responding to security breach by the neighbour

Justice N. Kirubakaran of the Madras High Court has expressed deep concern over India being dependent on one single neighbouring nation - China - for basic ingredients required for making medicines. “This dependency handicaps us in responding effectively to security and other breaches by the neighbour,” the judge said.

The judge made these observations in his 226-page judgement passed on a couple of writ petitions filed by Chennai-based Vinkem Labs, manufacturers of medicines for treating cancer. The petitioner had complained about lack of government support in carrying out generic research.

Hence, the judge ordered constitution of a committee comprising joint secretary-level officers from the Union Ministries of Pharmaceuticals and Finance in order to facilitate all necessary requirements, including fiscal needs, of the petitioner firm in carrying out its research on cancer cure.

“Our country is not investing much on research and researchers are not encouraged. In view of lack of support for research, experts are compelled to migrate to other countries. We have already lost very capable brains to other countries. Therefore, it is time to retain the experts/scientists like petitioner by giving required support,” he said.

The judge said that there were three important limbs of medicine making - generic research and development (R&D), active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and formulations. India was once a pioneer in generics and had earned the distinction of being the pharmacy to the world.

However, gradually, on account of import of API requirements at cheap costs, the country had now declined to a mere formulations hub. “Thus, India’s API segment built over several decades has given way for cheap imported APIs, primarily from China, who were able to sell their APIs at one-fourth of their corresponding manufacturing cost in India.

“As a result, our country that had once built 99.7% self-reliance in APIs went on to import over 90% of its API requirements from China. The economic advantage of importing APIs has led India to lose its scientific edge and self-reliance in APIs and India now thrives as a mere Finished Dosage Hub, that is, a country that imports its API requirements and bundles them into finished dosages,” the judge lamented.

He went on to state that on account of this abdication of domestic segment, the patients in the country had to face issues such as proliferation of sub-standard drugs and unavailability of life saving drugs. At one stage, even the National Security Advisor had cautioned the government of the danger to our national security on account of this excess import dependence from a single nation, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-judge-kirubakaran-concerned-over-indias-dependency-on-china-for-medicinal-ingredients/article32800734.ece
185,2020/10/08,Sagoserve applies for GI tag for Salem Sago,"It will boost business for over-400 sago and starch units in Salem, Erode, Nammakal and Dharmapuri belts

The Salem Starch and Sago Manufacturers Service Industrial Co-operative Society Limited, popularly known as Sagoserve, has applied for geographical indication (GI) tag for Salem Sago (Javvarisi).

On behalf of the society, the application for the GI tag was filed by P. Sanjai Gandhi, IPR Attorney and nodal officer for Geographical Indication Registration of products, Government of Tamil Nadu.

Chinnaraja G. Naidu, Deputy Registrar of Geographical Indications, confirmed that an application seeking GI tag for Salem Sago was filed this week. “Till date, we have registered 41 applications from Tamil Nadu and four applications have been advertised in the journal and awaiting clearance. Six more are pending for getting reply from the applicant. Recently, we received an application for Jaderi Namakatti,” he said.

The Salem Sago is made from wet starch powder crushed from Tapioca roots. Around 30-35% of starch content is said to be found in the Indian Tapioca root.

If GI tag is granted for this product, it will boost business for the farmers in this region and the over-400 sago and starch units in Salem, Erode, Nammakal and Dharmapuri belts, said those who have been in this business for several decades in the Salem region.

The Salem district uses almost 35,000 hectares of land for the cultivation of tapioca and the yield stands at 25-30 tonnes per hectare. Sago has low calorific value (310 kcal/100g) and its size generally ranges from 2 to 4.5 mm. One kg tapioca sago can be produced from 5kg of tapioca tubers.

Details furnished by Mr. Gandhi in the application show that in 1943, a person named Manickam Chettiar from Salem who was cultivating tapioca found that its flour can be used to make sago. This is how the journey of sago began. With the help of M. Venkatachalam Gounder ( a mechanic), Mr. Manickam Chettiar improvised the methods and machinery for production. The production capacity then went up from two bags of 100kg per day to 25 bags per day.

The application also highlighted that sago production has contributed extensively to the development of the economy of Salem from the year 1967. Currently over 80% of sago in India is produced in the Salem region and a majority of this is marketed through Sagoserve, while the rest are through direct sales.

Sago is used in various industries, including food, paper, construction, textile, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, mining, and alcohol, among others.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/fqe6sh/article32800573.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB08SAGO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sagoserve-applies-for-gi-tag-for-salem-sago/article32800574.ece
186,2020/10/08,HC reserves verdict on Theni MP Raveendranath Kumar’s application against voter’s plea,"Petitioner has suppressed the fact that he belongs to DMK, he says

The Madras High Court on Tuesday reserved its verdict on an application preferred by Member of Parliament P. Raveendranath Kumar to reject an election petition filed by a voter challenging his victory from Theni constituency on May 23, 2019.

Justice M.S. Ramesh decided to deliver the verdict on October 16 after the counsel concluded their arguments on the application to reject the election petition. Advocate V. Arun, representing the election petitioner P. Milany, opposed the MP’s plea.

On the other hand, the MP belonging to All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) accused the election petitioner of having suppressed the fact that he belonged to the rival party Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).

The election petition had been filed by Mr. Milany, who identified himself to be a 38-year-old mechanical engineer from Palanichettipatti in Theni Taluk, on the ground that the MP had allegedly indulged in corrupt practices to secure the victory.

The petitioner had accused the MP and also his father O. Panneerselvam, who was the Deputy Chief Minister as well as coordinator of AIADMK, of having misused the government machinery during the parliamentary elections held last year to ensure that he emerged victorious.

Mr. Kumar, however, refuted the allegations and said the petition should not be entertained since it was bereft of material facts and particulars regarding the alleged corrupt practices. The petitioner had failed to provide proof to substantiate the allegations, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/e0xi3z/article27257078.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27RAVEENDRANATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-reserves-verdict-on-theni-mp-raveendranath-kumars-application-against-voters-plea/article32799863.ece
187,2020/10/08,"Admission of 65 doctors in PG degree, diploma courses illegal, says Madras High Court","High time courts stopped showing misplaced sympathy, says High Court

It is high time that courts stopped showing misplaced sympathy for ineligible candidates admitted to medical courses, the Madras High Court said on Wednesday while declaring as invalid the admission of 65 doctors in various postgraduate degree and diploma courses in May 2017.

These candidates had now almost completed the courses and even written their final examinations on the basis of interim orders passed by the court.

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh said a stern message must be sent to medical institutions which admit ineligible students through dubious methods, year after year, by taking advantage of the delay in the commencement of the counselling process and the deadline fixed by the Supreme Court for completing admissions. Such an attitude would not be tolerated by the courts and such cases would not be dealt with “kid gloves,” he added.

“Every year, this court is able to see that there is a huge delay even to start the first round of counselling... It is not known as to whether such a confusion is created for any valid reasons or it is intentionally done to help the self-financing institutions to take advantage of the last minute chaos and admit candidates on their own,” the judge said.

Colleges asked to pay

He also imposed a total cost of ₹30 lakh on Arupadai Veedu Medical College, Vinayaka Mission Medical College, Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute, Sri Manakula Vinayakar Medical College and Hospital, Venkateswara Medical College and Hospital, and Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences, all in Puducherry, for having admitted the 65 doctors in the PG courses in violation of the norms.

The Medical Council of India (MCI) itself had directed the six institutions to discharge all 65 candidates. However, they had approached the High Court and obtained an interim stay of the discharge orders in 2018. While granting the stay, the court had obtained an undertaking from the students that they would not claim any equity if the writ petitions were taken up for final disposal after they complete their studies.

“Therefore, even though the dismissal of these writ petitions is going to cause great damage to their careers, it is something which is not totally unexpected” the judge said. He added that it was nevertheless a painful exercise for him to pass such an order after they had completed their course.

He said the blame was on the students, too, since they did not evince interest in conducting the cases after obtaining the interim orders. It was only when they were prevented from writing the final examinations that the doctors wanted the cases to be resurrected. “It is seen that the institutions and the candidates had taken a calculated risk and having undertaken such a risk, they must also be prepared for the consequences,” he observed.

Authoring a 134-page judgment, Justice Venkatesh said a part of the mistake was also on the courts that grant interim orders in college admission-related cases every year and take up those cases for final hearing only after students complete their courses. He said a cue must be taken from the present case and courts must give priority to such cases and dispose them at the earliest so that students need not waste their precious time.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/29y5al/article32799543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07TH-LT-MADRASHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/admission-of-65-doctors-in-pg-degree-diploma-courses-illegal-says-madras-high-court/article32799544.ece
188,2020/10/08,BJP-DMK tie-up possible: Pon Radhakrishnan,"DMK leaders reject former Union Minister’s claim

Senior BJP leader and former Union Minister of State Pon. Radhakrishnan on Wednesday claimed that the party’s alliance with the AIADMK was for the Lok Sabha polls and it would take a decision on an alliance for the upcoming Assembly elections next year that could include going with “either the AIADMK or the DMK”.

Mr. Radhakrishnan said the BJP’s alliance for the Assembly polls “could be with the AIADMK. Or it could be with the DMK, or we can form an alliance on our own. There is a possibility for everything”.

However, DMK treasurer T.R. Baalu told The Hindu that there was no such possibility. “The DMK’s alliance decision has to be taken only by the DMK president, M.K. Stalin, not by some Tom, Dick and Harry (sic),” he said.

Another senior leader in the DMK ruled out any alliance with the BJP. “Definitely not,” the leader shot back when asked if the party was considering any such alliance with the BJP.

189,2020/10/08,Chief Minister promises a ‘political revolution’,"Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, who was nominated as the Chief Minister candidate for the 2021 Assembly poll, on Wednesday pledged to carry out a “political revolution” in the State by ensuring the third successive victory of AIADMK in the forthcoming election.

In a statement addressed to party workers, Mr. Palaniswami, thanked Deputy Chief Minister-cum-party coordinator O. Panneerselvam and a host of others for proposing his candidature. He sought people’s cooperation and said “let us create a history by re-establishing the ‘golden reign’” that is currently happening in the State.

Giving an elaborate account of various decisions, schemes and policy measures of his government in the last three-and-a-half years, Mr. Palaniswami sought to project himself as a “farmer” and described his government as one being run by a farmer.

Asserting that his party had no place for “politics of family rule,” he said he was himself an example of how a person, through hard work, could come up the ladder, as his party had been functioning as per the advice of its founder, M.G. Ramachandran, that “only those who work hard are the best people.”

Dhanapal to receive their greetings, said the party’s “target and ambition” were directed towards the welfare of the people.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/chief-minister-promises-a-political-revolution/article32798304.ece
190,2020/10/08,‘AIADMK departed from tradition in view of prevailing situation’,"‘Party keeping up with the times’

The AIADMK, by declaring the 66-year-old Edappadi K. Palaniswami as its Chief Ministerial candidate for the 2021 Assembly election, is the latest to join the recent trend of major political parties announcing their CM candidates well ahead of polling.

It has to change its tack in view of the prevailing situation, according to many leaders of the party.

The party, when headed by its founder M.G. Ramachandran and his successor Jayalalithaa, did not formally promote them as its nominees for the CM post between 1977 and 2016.

Seeking to explain the difference between then and now, K.P. Munusamy, a party veteran and AIADMK deputy coordinator, says Mr. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister-coordinator of the party O. Panneerselvam, who are at the helm of the party, came from within the ranks.

“They have reached the present position, thanks to the guidance and support of Amma [Jayalalithaa]. It is but natural that we, in the party, have to declare Mr. Palaniswami our nominee so that there is no confusion among the party workers.”

Natural choice

Dindigul C. Sreenivasan, Minister for Forest and one of the organising secretaries, said Mr. Palaniswami, a four-time legislator and one-time Member of Parliament, had been providing “good governance” in the last three-and-a-half years. “It is but natural that he is projected as the CM candidate.”

A senior leader, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said there was a compulsion for the party to do “political branding” to counter the campaign of its principal adversary, the DMK, highlighting its chief, M.K.Stalin, as the next Chief Minister. “We, in the party, have been getting reports that several sections of society are of the view that Mr. Palaniswami, who first became Highways Minister in 2011 and got the PWD too five years later, has been functioning well as CM amid huge constraints of resources in the State. Who else can be promoted? So, the option for my party is very limited,” the leader observes.

C. Ponnaiyan, who was Minister during the Cabinets headed by MGR and Jayalalithaa and now Vice-Chairperson of the State Development Policy Council, says it was “incorrect” to say that MGR and Jayalalithaa were not projected as the CM nominees.

“Workers of the party and people of the State viewed them only as such. So, the present decision is nothing new.”

Besides, the day’s development was in line with the understanding reached between the camps of Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam at the time of merger of the two groups three years ago.

“Also, the rank and file of the party regard Mr. Palaniswami as the capable leader who can challenge the DMK,” Mr. Ponnaiyan adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-departed-from-tradition-in-view-of-prevailing-situation/article32798300.ece
191,2020/10/08,Tangedco drops order on completion certificate,"The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) has told its field officers to effect new service connection without insisting on completion certificates for certain types of buildings.

An earlier instruction issued on May 14, 2020, by the State utility said that except for residential buildings up to 12 metres in height and not exceeding three dwelling units, or 750 square metres, and all types of industrial buildings, all other building owners in the State must submit completion certificates to get electricity supply. This meant even a small commercial consumer with a 100 square feet shop cannot obtain a service connection without a completion certificate.

The May 14 instruction had cited the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019. Similarly, an instruction issued on June 4 cited a Madras High Court order on the issue.

An memo issued on October 6, 2020, by Tangedco’s Director (Distribution) instructed its field officials to follow the procedure for effecting service connections that prevailed before the issue of the instructions dated June 4 and May 14, which mandated producing completion certificates by small commercial and other consumers in the State.

Moving back to the old procedure would help new consumers get power supply without submitting a completion certificate. K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary, Coimbatore Consumer Cause, has written to the Tangedco chairman on the new instruction, alleging that it may be in contrary to the orders of the High Court. “The reversal of the order was issued without any reference or even reasons for withdrawal, which is quite surprising. We strongly oppose and condemn the action of the Tangedco for unilaterally taking such decisions, ignoring the High Court order as well as the rules framed by the Tamil Nadu government,” he said.

P. Muthusamy, former Director (Engineering), Tamil Nadu, pointed out that the shortcomings in the government order has led to unnecessary difficulties for small consumers, which has forced Tangedco to withdraw its earlier instructions.

“As per the government order, a small petty shop, tea shop or grocery shop owner should produce a completion certificate to get electricity supply, whereas the owner of a big, three floor, 7,500 square feet, residential building need not produce a completion certificate,” he noted.

Mr. Muthusamy pointed out that The Electricity Act, 2003, does not differentiate consumers based on a category to provide electricity and therefore the GO (which excludes all types of industrial buildings) is discriminatory, which put the Tangedco in a very difficult situation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tangedco-drops-order-on-completion-certificate/article32798291.ece

193,2020/10/08,HC poser on arrear exams cancellation,"The Madras High Court on Wednesday wondered how students of arts, science, engineering and postgraduate computer application courses could be expected to clear their arrears without writing examinations, when an expert body such as the All-India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) had opposed such a move by the State government.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha said they would not hesitate to call for details such as the number of arrears that each student had in their course of study or their academic performance since Class X. The judges were surprised over a government order (G.O.) issued on August 26, cancelling all arrear examinations citing the COVID-19 situation.

The senior judge in the Bench said neither the government nor Anna University had given a thought about the availability of qualified faculty before starting over 500 engineering colleges across the State. The result of opening such colleges was that there were now too many engineering graduates in the State, but many of them lacked employable skills.

The observations were made during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed by E. Balagurusamy, 75, former vice-chancellor of Anna University, through his counsel E. Vijay Anand, as well as another PIL petition filed by advocate B. Ramkumar Adityan to declare the August 26 G.O. illegal and arbitrary.

In his affidavit, Mr. Balagurusamy had said that he had chosen to file the PIL petition to save the quality of education, the future of students and the reputation of various universities in the State. He said the government’s decision had demoralised meritorious students who had cleared all papers without arrears.

“The G.O. will definitely lower the education standard of the students and the universities… Several students have approached me and expressed their apprehensions about the future prospects and further informed me that most students have more than 25 arrear papers and have less than 25% marks in most of the subjects,” he said.

The AICTE has already filed its response to the PIL petition and told the court that the government’s decision to cancel arrears was not in accordance with its guidelines. “The G.O. declaring all the students as passed without an assessment, by way of examination, is against the AICTE Act,” it said.

On Wednesday, advocate V. Sudha, representing the UGC, sought two weeks’ time to file a counter affidavit on behalf of the commission. Immediately, Mr. Anand said that it was essential for the UGC to file its counter affidavit since the State government had been claiming that arrear exams were cancelled as per UGC guidelines. When advocate Praveen Anand, representing some of the college students, also said that the exams were cancelled only as per UGC guidelines, Ms. Sudha begged to differ with him and said that the commission would make its stand clear in the counter affidavit.

Accepting her plea, the judges adjourned the cases to November 20.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-poser-on-arrear-exams-cancellation/article32798263.ece

The two properties could be valued at ₹2,000 crore, said sources in the Income Tax Department. Income tax officers stuck notices on the walls of the properties on Wednesday afternoon.

Sources said that after 1991, former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and Ms. Sasikala floated several firms in the names of Sasikala, V.N. Sudhakaran and J. Elavarasi. During the check-in period from 1991 to 1996, there were no business activities. But they were acquiring assets, including land, machinery and buildings. Among other properties, the Kodanad Tea Estate and the Siruthavur bungalow were bought in the name of the three.

The Supreme Court gave a finding that during the check-in period, Sasikala, Elavarasi, Sudhakaran did not have the source of funding and the properties were purchased from Jayalalithaa’s funds in their names. Attachment proceedings have been initiated under Section 24(3) of the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act. Copies were also sent to the offices of the sub-registrars concerned and Jayalalithaa’s legal heirs J. Deepak and Deepa, sources said.

When Krishnan arrived at the Government COVID-19 Hospital, Guindy, he was in a critical condition, requiring oxygen support, and spent the next few days in the intensive care unit (ICU). On the path of recovery now, he turned 80 on Wednesday and celebrated his birthday with patients and doctors at the hospital.

K. Narayanasamy, director of the Government COVID-19 Hospital in Guindy, said Mr. Krishnan was admitted on arrival to the zero-delay ward and shifted to the ICU. “He was in a critical condition. He had breathlessness and 50% lung involvement. His oxygen saturation level was very low, and he required oxygen support,” he said. As his condition stabilised, doctors shifted him to a normal ward. “I was on the regular ward rounds and inquired about his condition. He told me that his birthday was on October 7 and he was turning 80. So, we planned to celebrate his birthday in the ward,” he added.

The hospital administration and medical teams organised a celebration in the ward. Mr. Krishnan cut a cake as other patients and hospital staff cheered for him. “He was very happy to celebrate his birthday with all the new people around him. He turned emotional. It was a reason to be happy not just for him but also for the other patients. It was a way to show that we — doctors, staff nurses and paramedical staff — are there for them,” Dr. Narayanasamy added.

It was the National Institute of Ageing, Guindy, that was converted into a government COVID-19 hospital with 750 beds, including 100 ICU beds and 300 oxygen beds. It started functioning on July 7. So far, 4,555 patients have been admitted to the hospital and 3,904 of them have been discharged.

196,2020/10/08,CMC doctors implant heart valve through jugular vein,"The team used a made-in-India artificial valve

A team of cardiologists of the Christian Medical College (CMC) Hospital, Vellore, has used a novel percutaneous route to implant a pulmonary valve in a 54-year-old woman from Puducherry. The doctors implanted the new heart valve through the jugular vein, a blood vessel in the neck.

The patient had undergone open heart surgery for “Tetralogy of Fallot”, a condition in the heart that causes oxygenated blood and deoxygenated blood to mix with not enough blood reaching the lungs, when she was 9, at CMC. She had recently approached the hospital with progressive fatigue and trouble in doing her household activities.

At CMC, doctors found that one of her valves in the right side of the heart — pulmonary valve — was defective and was allowing reverse flow of blood into the heart.

This caused her pulmonary artery, the blood vessel that carries blood to the lungs, to enlarge significantly. If left untreated, this could lead to progressive deterioration of the heart function, according to a press release.

After a detailed evaluation, the structural heart team was of the view that she needed a new valve. Considering that she had undergone an open heart surgery in the past, a repeat surgery would carry higher risks and require prolonged hospital stay.

Non-surgical implant

Doctors pointed out that recent technological advancements in interventional cardiology allowed for implantation of new valves non-surgically. Over the past four years, they have been following a low-cost non-surgical or percutaneous valve implantation programme. By avoiding an open-heart surgery, the percutaneous procedure helped in reducing hospitalisation time and led to quicker recovery, doctors said.

For this patient, doctors used a made-in-India artificial heart tissue valve that was increasingly used in European countries such as Germany and the Netherlands.

With the patient’s pulmonary artery becoming exceptionally large, the largest portion of 32 mm of artificial valve was utilised for the procedure.

A team of cardiologists of cardiology unit-2 John Jose, Paul V. George and Harsha Teja — implanted the valve in the pulmonary position through the jugular vein under anaesthetic support by the cardiac anaesthetic team Raj Sahajanandan, Balaji and Kirubakaran.

“We have previously done valvuloplasties through the jugular vein. In some patients, inserting the catheter through the femoral vein (in the groin) and taking it to the heart can be technically challenging due to normal anatomical angulations and distortions due to disease pathology. In this patient, we had to take a large valve of 32 mm that required a puncture of about 8 mm in the jugular vein. This was the biggest challenge in the procedure,” Dr. Jose, professor of cardiology, said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/btodej/article32798130.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THCMC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cmc-doctors-implant-heart-valve-through-jugular-vein/article32798131.ece
197,2020/10/08,COVID-19 deals a severe blow to Thovalai garland-maker,"The closure of the flower market caused a shortage, leaving craftsmen in the lurch, especially the family making manikka malai

M.T. Vanithasree, an expert in making manikka malai (a special garland of flowers), is one of the craftsmen who showcased their talent to Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Mamallapuram.

She, along with her family, also went to Mumbai to decorate the puja room of industrialist Mukesh Ambani on the occasion of his daughter’s wedding. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has dealt her trade a severe blow.

“The flower market in my village Thovalai, a flower hub, was closed because of the lockdown. There is a sudden shortage of flowers. The earnings from all the weddings and temples festivals in the Tamil month of Panguni, Chithirai and Vaikasi, which would be enough for us to sail through a year, were cancelled. What sustained us was the free rice and the financial assistance from the government,” said Ms. Vanithasree, who is an engineer by training and teaches at a local engineering college.

Ms. Vanithasree belongs to a family of garland-makers specialising in the art of manikka malai at Thovalai in Kanniyakumari district. The entire village is involved in the trade of flower and garland-making, but not all can make manikka malai. Her father Muthamperumal is a State government award winner and grandfather L. Madasamy Pandaram won the national award from the Union Ministry of Textiles in 1988.

Her family daily sends a manikka malai for the decoration of the ‘utsavar’ (the processional deity) of the Padmanabhaswamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram. “The work ensured a regular income. But the suspension of transport from Tamil Nadu and Kerala made it impossible for us to send garlands. This affected our income. We resumed it only a month ago,” said Ms. Vanithasree, a fifth generation artiste.

She said that in Mamallapuram, the schedule for the Prime Minister and the Chinese President was to meet artisans from Thanjavur. “However, both of them turned towards me as soon as they entered the venue. Probably the scent and beauty of flowers and garlands would have attracted them. Mr. Modi explained the importance of flowers in our culture, and that was what I could understand from my little knowledge of Hindi,” she recalled.

She said manikka malai is made of oleander flowers and the leaves of notchi, a plant known for its medicinal value. “We use rose petals for making garlands for weddings. For temples, we will use oleander and notchi,” said Ms. Vanithasree, whose family, including her daughter and son, visited Rajasthan to demonstrate their skills at the World Association of Floral Art in February.

The making of manikka malai is a skilful art as it involves making separate strands before weaving them together to give a wholesome appearance. “We use the thread of the grass that is used to make carpets. An expert like my father can complete a one-and-a-half-foot -long garland in three hours. It will take four hours for others in the family to finish it,” said Ms. Vanithasree, who has trained her daughter Dharani and son Muthu in the art.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dtcgd1/article32798069.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th08garland,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-deals-a-severe-blow-to-thovalai-garland-maker/article32798070.ece
198,2020/10/08,"Tamil Nadu’s borrowings touch ₹50,000 cr. in 2020-21","It’s up 107% from ₹24,190 cr. in corresponding period last year

Tamil Nadu’s market borrowings have touched ₹50,000 crore so far in the fiscal year 2020-21, up 107% from ₹24,190 crore in the comparable period last year.

The lockdown imposed to curb COVID-19 has led to a challenging situation for the States with lower revenue collections on the one hand and increasing expenditure on the other, forcing them to borrow through the issue of bonds, known as State development loans.

Tamil Nadu has been the second highest borrower after Maharashtra, which has raised ₹52,500 crore, according to CARE Ratings. Tamil Nadu is followed by Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan.

According to the provisional figures of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), Tamil Nadu’s fiscal deficit (the difference between total revenue and expenditure excluding borrowings) was ₹21,833.48 crore in 2020-21 (till July).

The revenue deficit (the difference between the government’s revenue receipts and revenue expenditure) was ₹18,266.54 crore, as of July. A revenue deficit shows the government’s earnings are not adequate to meet its day-to-day operational expenses.

According to Care Ratings, Tamil Nadu has seen its borrowing cost decline to 6.16% so far in October, from 6.19% in September 2020. The average interest rate was 7% in April.

Tamil Nadu also seems to favour raising money through bonds with the tenure ranging from 10 years to 35 years, and has not utilised the short-term funding option through the Reserve Bank of India’s Ways and Means Advances facility. One of the reasons could be that in terms of bonds, the payments are phased out with a longer maturity period.

In the budget for 2020-21, Tamil Nadu pegged its net borrowings at ₹59,209.30 crore.

The Centre has increased the net borrowing limits of the State governments for 2020-21 to 5% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) from 3%. However, only 0.5% increase is unconditional and the remaining is subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions. The 0.5% leeway will enable Tamil Nadu to borrow an additional ₹9,627 crore.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadus-borrowings-touch-50000-cr-in-2020-21/article32798031.ece

The Central Bureau of Investigation has booked YSRCP (Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party) MP Kanumuru Raghu Rama Krishna Raju, his wife Rama Devi and nine others for allegedly cheating a consortium led by the Punjab National Bank (PNB) of over ₹826 crore, said the agency.

“The agency has conducted searches at 11 locations in Hyderabad, Mumbai and West Godavari in Andhra Pradesh, on the premises of Ind-Barath Thermal Power Limited, the borrower company which is located in Telangana’s Secunderabad, and other accused persons,” said a CBI official. Mr. Raju and his wife were also directors in the company.

In the complaint, the banks have alleged diversion and misappropriation of funds from 2014 to 2018. Among those named in the case are the company’s managing director and other directors.

The PNB alleged that it declared the loan account as a fraud in November 2019, after the other banks also took the same action.

According to the complaint, the company’s directors had approached the bank’s corporate branch in Delhi for the credit facilities.

Ind-Barath Thermal Power Limited, earlier known as Ind-Barath Power (Karwar) Limited, was to initially set up a 300 MW coal-based captive power plant in Karnataka. However, due to environmental clearance related issues, it shifted the project to Saminathan and Ottapidaram villages in Tamil Nadu’s Tuticorin.

The company was sanctioned a senior debt amounting to ₹941.80 crore and subordinated debt of ₹62.80 crore to part finance the project, which was completed. Subsequently, it sought working capital facilities to the tune of ₹300 crore in April 2014.

There were persistent irregularities in the accounts of the company, which were brought to its notice by all the lenders, alleges the FIR.

However, as alleged, no corrective action was taken and the loan accounts turned non-performing assets. The banks got a forensic audit done, which detected several alleged financial irregularities. The company violated the conditions by not routing the sale proceeds through the accounts with the lenders.

Certain transfers were made to the related parties through book entries to the detriment of lenders. During the check period, the company allegedly paid ₹267 crore to the related parties.

An additional amount of ₹41 crore, recoverable from non-related entities, was also transferred to the related parties through book entries, apart from the excess cash flows of ₹140 crore, according to the FIR.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/5qpwgl/article32806982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VJPG4-MP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cbi-books-ysrcp-mp-10-others-in-826-crore-bank-fraud-case/article32806983.ece

The Cabinet sub-committee constituted for suggesting steps to improve health and medical infrastructure has recommended inclusion of heart, kidney and liver transplantations under Aarogyasri programme.

The cabinet sub-committee which met under the chairmanship of Health Minister Eatala Rajender on Thursday resolved to submit a detailed report incorporating inclusion of transplantations under the Aarogyasri programme. The report will be submitted to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao soon.

The Cabinet sub-committee discussed health infrastructure related issues in detail during the meeting. Briefing reporters later, Mr. Rajender said the transplantation operations were presently being conducted at NIMS, Osmania and Gandhi hospitals. The cabinet sub-committee wanted these procedures to be extended to all teaching hospitals.

Patients particularly those from lower and middle classes were forced to spend ₹30 to ₹40 lakh on these transplantations and this was proving to be a huge burden on their finances. Inclusion of these procedures under Aarogyasri would ensure that the poor could opt for these surgeries without the feat of incurring huge expenditure. The government was prepared to amend the legislation governing the issue if need be.

Members of the sub-committee - Ministers K. Taraka Rama Rao, E. Dayakar Rao and Talasani Srinivas Yadav - senior health department officials participated in the meeting which also made several other recommendations.

The Minister said the health sector saw several changes since the formation of separate Telangana and these resulted in significant reduction in infant and maternal mortality rates. The maternal mortality rate dropped from 92 to 63 and infant mortality rate from 39 to 26.

The State was ranked third next only to Kerala and Tamil Nadu in terms of providing effective medical services to people. The Cabinet panel discussed measures to strengthen the services further. Accordingly, steps would be taken to strengthen primary healthcare centres while all hospitals would be equipped with CT Scan, MRI, X-ray and other facilities. Steps were also under way to strengthen the infrastructure at MNJ Cancer hospital. Mr. Rajender said the basti dawakhanas were functioning satisfactorily and steps had been initiated to enhance their number to 300 in the coming days. There were 198 basti dawakhanas functioning to full potential while another 26 would be opened before this month-end.

208,2020/10/08,Maratha quota: Prakash Ambedkar extends support to October 10 shutdown call,"He calls Udayanraje Bhosale an 'imbecile.'

While stating that the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) would back a shutdown called by Maratha outfits on October 10, its chief Prakash Ambedkar hit out at the two BJP MPs from the royal families purporting to represent the interests of the Maratha community.

Speaking in Pune, Mr. Ambedkar came down hard on Udayanraje Bhosale, BJP’s Rajya Sabha member from Satara and a direct descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji, calling him an ‘imbecile’.

Mr. Bhosale had called for all reservation to be abolished if the State government failed to ensure the implementation of the Maratha quota law. This irked Mr. Ambedkar.

Mr. Ambedkar, the grandson of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, claimed that he had not read anywhere of either Udayanraje Bhosale or Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje – the BJP’s Rajya Sabha member from Kolhapur – expressing their support to the bandh called by Maratha outfits.

“I wonder how a ‘dolt’ like MP [Udayanraje Bhosale], who does not understand the Indian Constitution, was sent by the BJP to the Upper House… how can he demand for all reservation to be scrapped if the Maratha quota law does not get implemented in the State,” said the VBA leader.

Mr. Ambedkar said community leader Suresh Patil of the ‘Maratha Arakshan (reservation) Action Samiti’ (MAAS) had called him to demand support for the rally and shutdown.

“I have accordingly discussed the issue with my office-bearers and activists. We have decided to extend our support to the shutdown with the understanding that the Maratha community will not demand their quota from the pre-existing reservation for the OBC community as they are separate things,” said Mr. Ambedkar.

He cautioned that given the tense situation prevailing in the State over the Maratha quota issue, there was a distinct possibility that social harmony between the Maratha community and the OBC community could fray if the former insisted on getting their benefits from those already granted to backward communities.

Furious response to statement

Mr. Ambedkar’s comments on Mr. Bhosale evoked a predictably furious response from the latter’s supporters, who raised slogans against him in Satara.

“Mr. Ambedkar’s condemnable remarks are an insult to the Chhatrapati’s throne… Maharashtra will not tolerate such regrettable statements,” said Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra Minister Shamburaj Desai, MLA from Satara.

Mr. Desai said both the descendants of Chhatrapati Shivaji had clarified their position on reservation.

While welcoming the VBA’s support for the shutdown, Mr. Suresh Patil said Mr. Ambedkar’s remarks on Mr. Bhosale were “regrettable” and utterly unwarranted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/48rx6j/article32777032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRAKASHAMBEDKARKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maratha-quota-prakash-ambedkar-extends-support-to-october-10-shutdown-call/article32805752.ece

The Kashmir High Court Bar Association (KHCBA), a body of over 1,200 lawyers, on Thursday decided to defer its polls because the administration failed to grant them the required permission.

“We had approached the Srinagar administration for permission to conduct the polls for office- bearers on October 5. The date of polling was October 8. However, we did not receive any order from the administration, which tantamounts to denial of permission. Polls have been cancelled for time being”, Mudasir Gulzar Vakil, secretary of the election commission of the Bar association, told The Hindu.

CMO opinion sought

Official sources said the district administration had sought the opinion of the Chief Medical Officer, Srinagar, whether such polls were feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, in the letter forwarded to the Srinagar administration, the HCBA promised that “all standard operating procedures (SOPs) as advised would be meticulously followed”.

Mr. Vakil said, “We are clueless about the denial, as traders' bodies were allowed to conduct elections”.

The candidates, who were contesting for different posts, had done poll campaigning and canvassing in the Valley courts.

210,2020/10/08,Supreme Court sets aside HC order allowing Chinmayanand to get copy of statement of rape victim,"The high court on November 7, 2019, had asked the trial court to provide the former Union Minister a copy of the statement of the woman, who had accused him of raping her.

The Supreme Court on Thursday set aside an Allahabad High Court order allowing former Union Minister and BJP leader Chinmayanand to access the statement made by a woman law student to a Magistrate in a rape case against him.

A Bench led by Justice U.U. Lalit concluded that the statement of the law student under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which is admissible as evidence in court, need not be shared with the accused at this point of time, especially in a case involving sexual exploitation.

The right to receive a copy of the statement is derived only after the court takes cognisance and necessary order to that extent is passed. The mere filing of chargesheet in the case does not entitle the accused to get the confessions and statements made under Section 164 Cr.PC, the court held.

“The High Court completely erred in appreciating the directions issued by this court, especially in a matter where the offences alleged against accused are of sexual exploitation. In such matters utmost confidentiality is required to be maintained. In our view, the High Court completely failed in that behalf,” the Supreme Court stressed in a 13-page judgment.

It held that “under no circumstances copies of statements recorded under Section 164 of the Code can be furnished till appropriate orders are passed by the court after taking cognisance in the matter.”

The law student came in appeal before the Supreme Court, which on November 15, last year had stayed the High Court order and had sought response from the State government and Chinmayanand.

The top court had also directed the Uttar Pradesh government to set up an SIT headed by an Inspector General-rank officer to look into the charges levelled by the woman, who had gone missing after accusing Chinmayanand of harassment, and was found in Rajasthan.

On September 21, 2019, Chinmayanand was arrested by the SIT and sent to jail.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5rahm3/article32068313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-supreme-court-of-india,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/supreme-court-sets-aside-hc-order-allowing-chinmayanand-to-get-copy-of-statement-of-rape-victim/article32804022.ece
211,2020/10/08,"Freeze ST list for good, tribal body tells Assam govt.","GoM told to find other ways of providing protection and privileges to 6 communities demanding ST status

An umbrella organisation of tribal bodies has advised the Assam government to freeze the list of Scheduled Tribe (Plains) “for good” and satisfy six communities demanding tribal status in a way that does not infringe up the rights of the existing tribes.

The six communities are Chutia, Koch-Rajbongshi, Matak, Moran, Tai-Ahom and ‘Tea Tribes’, a vague term used to mean more than 100 communities brought from eastern and central India as plantation workers almost two centuries ago.

“That the list of ST relating to the plains of Assam should be frozen for good and notified separately. But the government should take initiative to resolve the problem of the six communities and provide protection and privileges to all ethnic groups in any other manner without affecting the rights and interests and quotas of the plains tribal people of Assam,” All Assam Tribal Sangha secretary general Aditya Khakhlari said after a meeting with the Group of Ministers on Thursday.

Mr. Khakhlari represented the Coordination Committee of the Tribal Organisations of Assam (CCTOA) as its chief coordinator.

2 categories of STs

Assam has two categories of Scheduled Tribes (ST) – Plains and Hills. Data tabled in the Assembly in February 2019 say there are 14 ST (Plains) and 15 ST (Hills) besides 16 Scheduled Caste communities in the State.

The six communities in question are primarily dwellers of the plains. The Koch-Rajbongshi and Tai-Ahom communities had ruled much of eastern and north-eastern India in the medieval era.

Also Read | Now, Assam tribal groups plan political party

According to the CCTOA, the rights and privileges of the plains tribes of Assam were strained after the addition of five communities to the list of ST (Plains) after the 2001 census. The reservation quota for the ST (Plains) should thus be enhanced from the existing 10% to 15%, it told the government.

The other demands of the CCTOA included total protection of the identity and political rights of all the Sixth Schedule and autonomous councils for the tribes of Assam and creation of new autonomous councils for Mech, Hajong, Sarania Kachari and Madahi Kachari communities on the lines of the set-ups for four ethnic groups demanding ST status.

The CCTOA sought the creation of a Tirap tribal autonomous district council for communities in areas bordering southern Arunachal Pradesh.

BJYM national president Tejasvi Surya on Thursday came down heavily on the West Bengal government over the “brutal attack” on BJP activists, during their march to the state secretariat, and said it was a “black day as rule of law were murdered” in the state.

Surya, the BJP MP from Bengaluru South, also sought an inquiry by the Union Home Ministry into the blue chemical-laced water that was sprayed on party activists during the rally and termed it a “gross violation of human rights”.

“Today was a black day... The TMC government murdered rule of law in the state. The way our cadres and leaders were attacked and beaten up mercilessly by the police is unprecedented. Don’t we have the right to conduct a peaceful rally in the state?” he said during a press meet here.

The parliamentarian further asserted that he would continue to visit Bengal and conduct democratic protests to ensure that the TMC gets defeated in the next assembly polls.

213,2020/10/08,Nagaland govt. calls consultative meeting on peace talks,"Participants expected to discuss ways of ending the impasse

The Nagaland government has convened a “consultative meeting” with all mass-based organisations, extremist groups and NGOs on October 15 to discuss the Naga peace process.

The move follows a deadlock in the negotiations between the Centre and the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, or NSCN (IM), which prefers to be called National Socialist Council of Nagalim.

“All tribal hohos (tribe-based apex traditional bodies), mass-based organisations, civil societies, church organisations, political parties, NGOs, prominent persons, etc., are being invited to discuss the most important issue that our society is presently faced with,” an official statement said.

The NSCN (IM) had declared a ceasefire in 1997 followed by other extremist groups since 2001. But a solution has eluded the ‘Naga political issue’ despite several rounds of talks over more than two decades.

The Nagaland government headed by Neiphiu Rio is believed to have sensed the growing impatience to address the issue by involving all sections of the Naga society. The meeting is expected to provide a common platform to various organisations and outfits for expressing their views on multiple issues and reach a consensus.

The Centre has been holding peace talks separately with the NSCN (IM) and the Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs), a conglomerate of seven other outfits. The Centre is believed to have reached an agreement on all outstanding issues with the NNPGs while the demands of a Naga flag and Naga constitution have clouded the talks with the NSCN (IM).

The road to a “honourable solution” to the Naga political problem has been bumpy because it involves the aspirations of the Nagas from Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh besides Nagaland. Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh are particularly worried about losing territory if the Naga peace accord is signed.

The fear stems from the NSCN (IM)’s vision for Greater Nagalim, an administrative set-up comprising all Naga-inhabited areas in the northeast as well as adjoining Myanmar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nagaland-govt-calls-consultative-meeting-on-peace-talks/article32803145.ece

Read: Editorial | Grapes of wrath

In the letter to SP Hathras, accused Sandeep Singh claims that he and three others were falsely implicated in the case by the victim’s family.

The letter, widely circulated on social media, has thumb impressions of all the accused, the other three being Ravi, Lavkush and Ramu.

In the letter, Sandeep claims that he was friends with the victim and the two would also speak on phone but the girl’s family did not approve of their friendship.

He also goes on to claim that on the day of the incident, he met the victim in the fields and that she was accompanied by her brother and mother. He further says through hearsay information that after he left the spot on the girl’s request, her brother and mother beat her up.

Alok Singh, Senior Superintendent, Aligarh Jail, confirmed that Sandeep had sent a letter to the SP Mathura. Mr. Singh said he forwarded the letter to SP Hathras as per the rules.

Relative’s charge

Reacting to the letter, a female relative of the victim told a television channel that she sensed “plans” being played out to protect the four accused. “Stories are being pitched to save them. Everything is theirs, the ministers and the MPs are theirs. Who do we have? Poor people don’t have anyone except for god”, she said.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, without any specific reference, took to Twitter saying the woman deserved “justice not slander”.

“Creating a narrative that defames a woman’s character and holding her somehow responsible for crimes committed against her is revolting and regressive”, Ms. Vadra said.

Violence erupted on Thursday in Kolkata and parts of Howrah during a BJP march to the State Secretariat (Nabanna).

At many places, police used force by resorting to baton charge and tear gas shelling and using water cannons to disperse the protesters. The area around the Howrah Maidan, Howrah Bridge, and Santragchi in Howrah district, as well as Burrabazar and Hastings in Kolkata area looked like a war zone with intermittent clashes between BJP supporters and police. Traffic in large parts of the central area of the city came to a halt from noon to 2 p.m.

Protesters hurled stones at the police and tried to breach barricades. Several BJP supporters were injured in the violence. BJP national secretary Arvind Menon and State BJP vice president Raju Banerjee were among those hospitalised.

The party’s youth wing had called the protest march to highlight “deteriorating law and order situation in the State” among other issues.

Thousands of BJP supporters from different parts of the State had assembled in the city to participate in the march. Tents were put up in front of the party’s State headquarters in central Kolkata to accommodate people. Along with youth wing president Soumitra Khan, national president of the BJP Yuva Morcha Tejasvi Surrya was present in the Howrah protest march.

“The police had made unprecedented arrangements. Senior party leaders have sustained injuries. I also fell down. The attempt to suppress a peaceful movement will have more ramifications,” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said. A number of BJP MPs and party’s national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya participated in the protest march.

‘Crude bombs hurled’

Thousands of police personnel were deployed at the key intersections leading to the Secretariat. “The assembly has been declared illegal. We are urging you to disperse,” police personnel trying to disperse the crowd announced over microphones as protesters engaged in pitched fight with the police. There were reports of crude bombs being hurdled in the Howrah Maidan. The police seized a firearm from a person during mob dispersal.

‘Blue liquid came from water cannon’

Speaking to journalists later in the evening, Mr. Tejasvi Surya said that about 1,000 party supporters were injured and about 500 taken in custody. He asked why the police mixed some dark blue chemical in the water used in water cannons. “We demand an inquiry into the use of this dark blue chemical, which is not used anywhere. This is gross abuse of human rights,”he said, adding it was a “black day in democracy” of the State.

State’s Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay said a letter was sent by a political organisation on the evening of October 7 seeking permission for the rally to which the Home department has replied. “The applicant last evening had mentioned several rallies and said each of the rallies will have 25,000 youths. If several rallies, each having 25,000 youths, had to be sanctioned, that would have been a travesty as per the NDMA Act and lockdown norms,” he added.

The blue liquid used in the water cannon was nothing but a colour, which was a practice followed globally to identify people after dispersal if required for necessary legal action,he noted. According to him, 123 people have been detained by the Kolkata and Howrah police in the rally.

Trinamool’s charge

The Trinamool Congress leadership accused the BJP of trying to incite violence through the protest rally. “Rallies of political parties are not held with firearms and crude bombs. This an attempt by the BJP to frighten people by using force,” its leader and Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim said.

217,2020/10/08,‘ST status to non-tribals will destroy tribals’,"Indigenous people call upon govt. issued ahead of its meeting with leaders of 6 communities

An indigenous lawyers’ collective has called upon the Assam government not to “destroy the tribal communities” of the State by granting Scheduled Tribe status to six non-tribal communities.

The Indigenous Lawyers’ Association of India (ILAI) made the appeal ahead of a meeting between the group of Ministers headed by Himanta Biswa Sarma and leaders of the six communities on October 8.

The six communities demanding ST status in Assam are Koch-Rajbongshi, Tai-Ahom, Chutia, Matak, Moran and Tea Tribes.

“There are communities among the six who have never been considered as tribes by any government or anthropological study and they do not possess any characteristics that tribal people do. Hence, the Assam government’s proposed inclusion of some socio-economically advanced and populous communities in the list of STs is mala fide and it shall eliminate the very concept of ‘tribals’ in India,” ILAI president Dilip Kanti Chakma said on Wednesday.

“Some of these communities are identified as Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and there is no provision in law to transport them from OBC to ST. While the OBC categorisation is based on caste, the STs are totally on a different footing,” he added.

If these communities are included in the list of the STs, the social and educational well-being and political representation from Gram Sabha to the Lok Sabha of the existing STs of Assam shall be affected and the already marginalised STs shall be further marginalised, the ILEA said.

Groups such as the All Assam Tribal Sangha and the Coordination Committee of the Tribal Organisations of Assam have been opposing the move to grant ST status to the six communities, specifically the Koch-Rajbongshi and Tai-Ahom who reigned over large swathes of present-day Assam, Bangladesh and West Bengal during the medieval period.

The tribal groups have been pointing out that granting ST status to the six communities would violate India’s assurances to the United Nations (UN) to obtain free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous people before adopting and implementing any legislative measures that are against the provisions of Article 19 of the UN Declaration on the Rights of the Indigenous Peoples.

India had supported the declaration adopted by the UN’s General Assembly on September 13, 2007.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/st-status-to-non-tribals-will-destroy-tribals/article32798727.ece

The major demand of the party is the establishment of Tipraland — a separate State for the indigenous population.

IPFT assistant general secretary Mangal Debbarma said that the party’s highest decision-making body endorsed the strike to highlight the demands to safeguard minority tribals. He also said a party delegation, comprising a Minister, a few MLAs and senior leaders, would visit New Delhi this month to take up the demands with Union Home Minister Amit Shah and top BJP functionaries.

Though the party focuses on Tipraland, it is also demanding empowerment of the TTAADC through constitutional amendment. October 15 marks the anniversary of the erstwhile princely state’s merger with the Indian union in 1949.

This is the second strike call of the IPFT during the pandemic. A strike was undertaken on July 9.

Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Wednesday wrote a letter to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, asking him to order a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into murder of a “political-social worker of Purnia district”.

Mr. Yadav and his brothers are named in the FIR pertaining to the case.

The Purnia police arrested seven persons in connection with the Shakti Mallik murder on Wednesday and claimed to have solved the case.

Former RJD leader and social worker Shakti Mallik was murdered in Purnia district on October 4 at his residence and later, in the FIR lodged at the local Khajanchi Haat police station, Tejashwi Yadav and his older brother Tej Pratap, along with four others, were named as accused persons in the case by Khushboo Devi, wife of the deceased. In poll-bound Bihar, Janata Dal-United (JD-U) leaders and party spokespersons slammed the RJD leaders for being named in the murder case and demanded action.

“Because of some pressing engagements, I came to know about this incident late, but I also saw that after my name and my brother’s name in a prompted FIR, stories of media management started coming in, along with cheap statements by your party spokespersons…but despite all this, I think, law should take its own course in this case with a speedy investigation,” Tejashwi Yadav wrote in the letter addressed to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.

Mr. Tejashwi Yadav also asked for the CM’s recommendation to “get the case investigated soon by any national or international investigative agencies”, and being Home Minister of the State, he said, Mr. Kumar could even get him arrested for interrogation even before he [Mr.Yadav] had filed his nomination papers in the Assembly elections. “I hope you will think over it and immediately recommend to hand over the case to CBI for inquiry,” Mr. Yadav said at the conclusion of his one-page letter.

The other four accused persons named in the FIR are Anil Kumar Sadhu, Kalo Paswan, his wife Sunita Devi, and Manoj Paswan. Anil Kumar Sadhu is the son-in-law of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and president of the RJD’s State Scheduled Caste cell. He was earlier in the Lok Janshakti Party.

The deceased, Shakti Mallik, 38, was the former RJD State secretary for the party’s SC/ST cell, and wanted to contest the upcoming State Assembly elections from the Raniganj (reserved) seat of the neighboring Araria district. Earlier, in a video which went viral on social media, the deceased made serious allegations against RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav and Anil Kumar Sadhu for demanding ₹50 lakh to ensure a ticket to contest the Assembly election on an RJD ticket.

The deceased joined the RJD in 2019 and was made State SC/ST cell secretary of the party, but after he was denied a ticket, he made serious allegations against party leaders and was expelled from the RJD.

His wife Khushboo Devi has charged in the FIR that since her husband was to contest the Assembly election as an Independent candidate, he was “eliminated at the behest of RJD leaders, including Tejashwi Yadav”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/50wels/article32798663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8TH-TEJ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tejashwi-wants-cbi-probe-into-murder-of-political-social-worker/article32798664.ece

223,2020/10/08,Bodoland poll gets Assam Cabinet nod,"The Sarbananda Sonowal-led Assam Cabinet on Wednesday decided to request the State Election Commission to schedule the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) election in December.

The elections to 40 seats in the Council were to have been held on April 4 but were deferred to the pandemic. The council has been under the Governor’s rule since its dissolution on April 27.

The Governor’s rule ends on October 27.

“The Cabinet also decided to make Bodo the associate official language in Assam through an ordinance and asked the BTC authority to extensively use Assamese along with Bodo and English on signboards,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said.

Also approved was the issuance of an ordinance to form the Bodo-Kachari Autonomous Council in Bodo community-dominated areas beyond the BTC under the Sixth Schedule.

These decisions are said to have been taken with the BTC polls in mind. The BJP and ally Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), which had been ruling the council since 2003 until its dissolution, have not been in the best of terms in recent times.

There is speculation that the BJP has been cultivating BPF’s rival United People’s Party Liberal, whose president Pramod Boro was a key signatory of the Peace Accord with all factions of a disbanded extremist group in January.

Among the Cabinet decisions were a few sops for tea plantation labourers, a major chunk of voters that swung from the Congress to the BJP before the 2016 Assembly polls.

With the 2021 State polls about six months away, the Cabinet decided to provide day boarding and free uniform for children of plantation labourers in 428 schools managed by tea estates.

224,2020/10/08,Christian group flays pastor’s arrest in Arunachal,"Action taken for illegal construction of a church, say Tawang district authorities

A Christian organisation in Arunachal Pradesh has slammed the authorities of Buddhist-dominated Tawang for the arrest of a pastor on charges of illegally constructing a church.

Joseph Singhi was arrested on October 6 and released on bail hours later. The local police had also detained and recorded the statements of eight of his associates.

Tawang’s Additional Deputy Commissioner Lobsang Tsering said the arrest was made on the basis of a first information report lodged by the district Land Revenue and Survey officer.

The action followed complaints by two groups — the Indigenous Faith and Cultural Society of Arunachal Pradesh and Monpa (dominant Buddhist community) Mimang Tsogpa — against the pastor and others for allegedly constructing a Revival Church illegally.

The church is located behind the district planning officer’s quarters in Tawang’s AIR Colony. The minuscule Christian community in the district claimed the church has stood there since they occupied the plot in 1999 with the department concerned “ignoring their application for land allotment initiated in 2003”.

“We were assured allotment of the piece of land after we met Chief Minister Pema Khandu and Chief Secretary [Naresh Kumar] in August. We started construction of the church out of frustration,” said Sonara Degio, vice-president of the Arunachal Pradesh Christian Revival Church Council (APCRCC).

“Pastor Singhi and the Christian community here are under stress,” Mr. Degio told The Hindu from Tawang, about 450 km northwest of capital Itanagar.

A district official said the pastor had been served several notices to stop the construction of the church and dismantle the structures. The last such issue on the basis of a Supreme Court directive was served in 2017.

The apex court had on September 29, 2009 said no unauthorised construction shall be permitted in the name of temple, church, mosque, gurudwara or any other place of worship on public facilities.

The APCRCC said the district authorities invoked the Arunachal Pradesh Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupant) Act, 2003, after Mr. Singhi had allegedly failed to comply with the order to stop construction. Work on the church had started in 2015.

APCRCC president Tai Ete said the police action was ‘unjust’ since public spaces have been used in the State for structures associated with other faiths.

The district authorities denied targeting any particular community. Officials said land allotments issued to many private and public parties have been cancelled in more than a decade.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/christian-group-flays-pastors-arrest-in-arunachal/article32798167.ece
225,2020/10/08,Ex-Assam DIG in CID custody,"Prime accused in paper leak case was nabbed on Tuesday

A court in Guwahati on Wednesday gave the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) custody of former Deputy Inspector General of Assam police Prasanta Kumar Dutta for six days.

The retired DIG, one of the prime accused in the leaking of question papers for appointing 597 unarmed sub inspectors, was arrested by the West Bengal police from Kakarbhitta on the India-Nepal border on Tuesday.

The CID had sought a week’s custody but the court of the chief judicial magistrate prescribed six days. The court also directed the CID to check Mr. Dutta’s health at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital before interrogation.

The former DIG had tested negative for COVID-19 hours after a police team that fetched him from northern West Bengal on Tuesday night. The police, however, told the court that he was suffering from high blood pressure, diabetes and cardiac problem.

Jobs for cash

Mr. Dutta and suspended Bharatiya Janata Party leader Diban Deka had allegedly assured jobs to many candidates for cash.

Handwritten copies of the leaked question paper were given to 50 job aspirants who sat for the “written test” at a guesthouse in Guwahati on September 19, a day ahead of schedule.

Some 66,000 candidates had started answering the questions on the scheduled date when the exam was questioned following a social media upload of the leaked question paper.

The “recruitment scam” saw retired IPS officer Deepak Kumar quit as the chairman of the State Level Police Recruitment Board, which later rescheduled the date for the written test to November 22.

At least 24 people, including the former DIG and the BJP leader have been arrested for the question paper leak.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ex-assam-dig-in-cid-custody/article32798139.ece
226,2020/10/08,U.P. govt. inks agreement with Swiss firm for Jewar airport,"To be opened in 2024, it will handle 1.2 cr. passengers per year

The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday signed a concession agreement with representatives of Zurich Airport International for designing, building and operating the Noida International Airport at Jewar for a period of 40 years.

The airport will be developed on Public-Private Partnership (PPP) basis and is scheduled to open in 2024. It will be located at a distance of 70 kms from Delhi, 40 kms from Noida and 130 kms from Agra.

“We are targeting the first six months for financial closures and the next 36 months for completion of the first phase of airport with a capacity of 1.2 crore passengers per annum. The project will be constructed with an initial investment of ₹4,588 crore for the first phase,” Daniel Bircher, Chief Executive Officer, Zurich Airport International Asia, told The Hindu in an e-mail. The airport will open with a single runway, but once it is fully developed by 2040, it will have two runways and will have a capacity of 7 crore passengers per annum.

Land for expansion

The airport will be developed on 1,334 hectares of land and the U.P. government has reserved an additional 5,000 hectares for airport expansion, Mr. Bircher added.

Zurich Airport International AG (ZAIA) won the contract to build and operate the airport for a period of 40 years last November. ZAIA received the security clearance from the Ministry of Home Affairs in May this year.

To a question on whether another international airport so close to one in the national capital will be viable, Mr Bircher replied, “The Noida international airport will be a visionary airport for Delhi NCR, Noida and Western U.P., which will activate the catchment area and connect it to other metropolitan areas in India and the world. We see Noida International airport as complementary and an efficient alternative to Indira Gandhi International Airport which is set to reach its peak capacity of 11 crore in the next six or seven years”.

227,2020/10/08,Indian Premier League 2020 | The ‘Surya scoop’,"Suryakumar revealed that his batting partner Hardik Pandya was of immense help while producing that extraordinary shot.

When a Jofra Archer knuckle-ball crashed into Suryakumar Yadav’s helmet during Mumbai Indians’ clash against Rajasthan Royals on Tuesday, many would have been wondering how the batsman would respond.

The Mumbaikar came up with a perfect riposte, scooping a yorker, bowled at nearly 150kmph, over third-man for a six. Suryakumar, whose unbeaten 79 off 47 balls set up MI’s first win against Royals in five years, revealed that his batting partner Hardik Pandya was of immense help while producing that extraordinary shot.

Hardik’s take

“Hardik was like, ‘this is the time, let’s try and do something different’. I asked him given his experience what he feels, what he [Archer] was going to try? He was like, ‘he may hit a yorker.’ I said let’s get prepared for that,” Suryakumar said during a media interaction on Thursday.

“That was one of the shots I had been practising during lockdown. I just tried to execute it without thinking about anything else, and it worked.

“The first few hours were a little disturbing. But the physios and doctors took good care of me and I am feeling better now,” said Suryakumar about the impact of the Archer delivery.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cl4gor/article32806573.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09SURYAKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-the-surya-scoop/article32806574.ece
228,2020/10/08,"Indian Premier League 2020 | Change in roles paid off, says Kyle Mills","‘Playing Tripathi as opener and Narine as pinch-hitter helped team win’

Bowling coach Kyle Mills said the ploy to play an in-form Rahul Tripathi as an opener and Sunil Narine as a pinch-hitter helped Kolkata Knight Riders in its 10-run win over Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Wednesday.

Keeping it tight

Narine, who batted at No. 4 after failing as an opener in previous matches, scored a quick 17. Bowling late, he kept it tight and took the crucial wicket of Shane Watson (50).

“We used Sunil as a pinch-hitter against CSK. A change is as good as a holiday, they say. We moved Tripathi to the top and it paid off for him. Sunil played a cameo, it gave us a little momentum,” Mills said at the post-match press conference.

“With the ball, Sunil came in to bowl a little late, but the job he did at the back-end was comforting to see for us on the sidelines.”

Mills said man-of-the-match Tripathi’s impressive 51-ball 81, which enabled KKR to post a competitive 167, was magical to see.

“Not just in the (KKR) academy, the four weeks leading into the camp here, he was exceptional. He is an example to everyone. He is reaping the rewards.”

Mills praised death-over specialist Andre Russell.

“It’s a real specialist skill-set as to how we like him to bowl at the end of the things… He not only bowls very good yorkers, but he has the ability to bowl fast bouncers. He is a great hand at the back-end of the innings.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wwkaq9/article32806387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09RUSSELL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-change-in-roles-paid-off-says-kyle-mills/article32806389.ece
229,2020/10/08,Indian Premier League 2020 | Kings pull it back after Bairstow-Warner show,"Leg-spinner Bishnoi and left-arm seamer Arshdeep strike after the Sunrisers openers forge a 160-run partnership

Sunrisers Hyderabad openers Jonny Bairstow (97, 55b, 7x4, 6x6) and David Warner (52, 40b, 5x4, 1x6) went on the rampage with a 160-run stand, but the middle-order frittered away the advantage as the team finished at 201 for six against Kings XI Punjab at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday.

Sunrisers pulled into gear right from the start as Sheldon Cottrell leaked 13 in the first over. Bairstow smashed three boundaries — through cover-point, extra-cover and square-leg — in Cottrell’s next over.

K.L. Rahul, who is not donning the big gloves these days, dropped Bairstow on 19 off Mohammed Shami in the fifth over. The Kings XI captain’s full-length dive at mid-off was not enough to stop the flat-batted stroke. The missed chance seemed to have fired up Bairstow who went on to hit three sixes off leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi.

Perfect pair

While the Englishman was ruthless, his Australian partner kept the scoreboard ticking with quick singles and two, and the odd fours. Warner also employed his ambidextrous improvisations, tweaking the switch-hit stance a little wide and playing a cut shot like a right-hander off Glenn Maxwell’s bowling, evoking a smile from the bowler. The SRH skipper, who has a special liking for Kings XI, made his ninth half-century against the Punjab side.

Rahul looked clueless as Sunrisers motored along at more than 10 an over. He threw the ball to Maxwell, hoping that the off-spinner will peg back the openers. However, Maxwell was hit for two consecutive sixes and a four and conceded 20 runs. Kings XI pulled things back in the 16th over. The 20-year-old Bishnoi forced Warner to miscue a slog-sweep off a googly and Maxwell, stationed at long-on, didn’t even have to move to receive the offering. Three balls later, Bishnoi trapped Bairstow in front.

Left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh, playing his first game of the season, then caught and bowled Manish Pandey while Priyam Garg was caught by Nicholas Pooran at long-on. Abdul Samad was Bishnoi’s third wicket, the leggie finishing with figures of three for 29 in three overs and ensuring that all was not lost for Kings XI.

Kings were 96 for three in 10 overs, with Pooran (58) and Maxwell (5) at the crease.

230,2020/10/08,"No need to tinker but can allow two bouncers per over in T20 cricket, says Sunil Gavaskar","Sunil Gavaskar did put forth a few suggestions for the T20 cricket which could be seriously considered by the lawmakers of the game.

The legendary Sunil Gavaskar believes that T20 cricket doesn’t need much tinkering as it is in “pink of health” but custodians of the game can consider allowing two bouncers per over, moving ahead.

The shortest format, over the years, has witnessed dominance of batsmen across the globe with bowlers having little to play for on flat decks with short boundaries.

Does he foresee see a rule change to ease the pressure off bowlers?

“The T20 game is doing very well and there’s no need to tinker with it,” Gavaskar told PTI during an exclusive interview from the UAE where he is working as a broadcaster for the Indian Premier League.

But the iconic figure did put forth a few suggestions which could be seriously considered by the lawmakers of the game.

“It is loaded heavily in favour of the batsmen for sure. So, give a fast bowler two bouncers per over and yes the boundaries can be easily longer, if the ground authorities want it,” he said.

“Also look at giving an extra over to the bowler who takes a wicket in his first three overs. But seriously there’s no need to bring any changes at all,” the 71-year-old opening great added.

Talking about rules, Gavaskar suggested that the TV umpire should be empowered to check whether a non-striker is backing up too far even before a bowler has delivered the ball.

So, why haven’t the custodians of the game thought about penalising the batsman, who is stealing three to five yards by backing up too far at the non-striker’s end?

“There is a penalty of being dismissed if the bowler runs out the non-striker who is moving out of the crease before the ball is delivered,” Gavaskar said.

But he feels that if TV umpire finds that the non-striker is backing up too far, even if there is a boundary, it should be ruled “one short” as a penalty.

“Now that the TV umpire is also checking if the bowler has overstepped for no balls, he should be able to see if the non-striker has left the crease before the ball is released and if he has, then if runs are taken, it can be called one short even if a boundary or four is hit. This should act as a deterrent,” Gavaskar said.

Gavaskar has consistently objected to the use of the term “Mankading” as he believes it is an insult to one of India’s greatest cricketers late Vinoo Mankad.

Mankad ran Bill Brown out at the non-striker’s end for backing up too far during a Test match between India and Australia in 1948.

While Australian captain Sir Donald Bradman had declared that Mankad was perfectly right and acted within the rules, the media Down Under of that era referred to the dismissal as “Mankading”.

The legend put things in perspective as to why it is so legitimately objectionable to say ‘Mankading’

“I don’t know about it being deliberately ingrained in us but out of all the so-called unsportsmanlike acts on the cricket field, this mode of dismissal is the only one that has been given a name.

“With all the talk about doing away with terms like ‘Chinaman’ and ‘French cut’ because it’s politically incorrect, it’s about time this disparaging term is dumped in the bin too,” he said.

Gavaskar also lauded senior off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who gave a warning to Aaron Finch for backing up too far during an IPL game between Delhi Capitals and RCB but also made it clear that he wouldn’t spare the batsman the next time.

“Ashwin is one of the most astute of cricketers. By this gesture he has shown respect and regard to his coach Ricky Ponting, who has expressed his displeasure at this sort of dismissal.

“However, he has also announced publicly that this is the final warning and if from now on anybody strolls out of his crease then he should be prepared to walk back to the dug-out,” he concluded.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/d1rkk4/article32801934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SunilGavaskar,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/no-need-to-tinker-but-can-allow-two-bouncers-per-over-in-t20-cricket-says-sunil-gavaskar/article32801935.ece
231,2020/10/08,"Back at ‘happy hunting ground’ Sharjah, Rajasthan Royals aiming to halt Delhi Capitals’ march","Led by Shreyas Iyer, Delhi have looked solid in all three departments, winning four out of their five matches.

Struggling to figure out their best eleven, Rajasthan Royals will need to come up with some quick-fix measures to snap their three-match losing streak when they take on a formidable Delhi Capitals unit in an IPL match here on Friday.

The Royals were off to a flying start, winning both their games at Sharjah but they have struggled to adjust to the bigger grounds of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, slipping to three successive defeats.

Now back to the Sharjah Cricket Stadium, Rajasthan will take inspiration from their two big wins here to turn things around against a dominant Delhi.

Led by Shreyas Iyer, Delhi have looked solid in all three departments, winning four out of their five matches.

For Rajasthan, time is running out as they still have not been able to find their best playing XI. While the return of Ben Stokes will give them hope but the England allrounder is currently in quarantine and will be available only after October 11.

The sudden loss of form of skipper Steve Smith and Sanju Samson -- who did bulk of the scoring in the first two matches, is as much a reason for their failure as the lack of runs from the Indian batsmen in the team.

RR did try to rejig their line-up against Mumbai Indians by including young batsman Yashasvi Jaiswal and pacer Kartik Tyagi and Ankit Rajpoot in the playing XI but it didn’t change their fortunes.

Indian Premier League 2020 | Full schedule of matches

While Jaiswal was out for a second-ball duck at the top, Rajpoot went for 42 in his three overs but young Tyagi showed promise with his one for 36.

The good news for RR is the return to form of opener Jos Buttler, who scored a fine 44-ball 70 in their last game.

In bowling, Jofra Archer and Tom Curran have been left to do the heavy lifting, while spinner Rahul Tewatia has not been to produce the breakthroughs consistently.

Delhi, on the other hand, have been a well-oiled machine, boosting of a solid bowling unit which is well supported by the batsmen.

While skipper Iyer has been in good form, opener Prithvi Shaw and Rishabh Pant have done their job well. Marcus Stonis too have produced two smashing fifties so far.

On the bowling front, Kagiso Rabada has looked ominous with 12 wickets to emerge as the best bowler in the IPL so far. South African pacer Anrich Nortje too has delivered when the team needed him to.

Harshal Patel, as Ishant Sharma’s replacement, did well against Kolkata Knight Riders with 2 for 34 but he conceded 43 in their last match.

A fit-again Ravichandran Ashwin, who replaced injured Amit Mishra, also returned with one wicket for 26 in his comeback game.

232,2020/10/08,"We could’ve used the batting resources better, says Fleming","Jadhav was trolled heavily on social media following the defeat.

Despite his struggles so far in the tournament, Kedar Jadhav was once again sent ahead of big hitters Ravindra Jadeja and Dwayne Bravo that proved costly for Chennai Super Kings against Kolkata Knight Riders on Wednesday.

The India batsman could only manage seven runs off 12 balls as he failed to get the big shots going.

Reasoning

When asked about the thinking behind this, CSK coach Stephen Fleming said, “we were hoping that Kedar could play the off-spinner (Sunil Narine) well and also Jadeja to come and finish.”

The team has often been found wanting in terms of using its batting resources smartly with the big-hitters coming too late.

“We have got so much batting resources. We could have gone a whole lot of different ways. That is one of the things we will look at, could we have done it a little bit better... but it is all in hindsight,” he added.

The former New Zealand skipper also added that one of the set batsmen should have seen the chase through.

“If we had got one of the batsmen to get 75-plus and continued the partnership for five more overs, then the game might have been a lot different.

233,2020/10/08,"IPL 2020 | Batsmen let the team down, should have achieved the target: Dhoni","Chasing 168, veteran opener Shane Watson struck his second successive fifty to give CSK a perfect start, but the team choked at the back end of the innings and was restricted to 157 for five to suffer its fourth defeat from five matches.

Chennai Super Kings skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni said the batsmen let the team down after a spirited comeback by the bowlers in their Indian Premier League game against Kolkata Knight Riders here on Wednesday.

Chasing 168, veteran opener Shane Watson struck his second successive fifty to give CSK a perfect start, but the team choked at the back end of the innings and was restricted to 157 for five to suffer its fourth defeat from five matches.

“In the middle overs, there was a phase when they bowled two-three good overs. Then we lost two-three wickets in a row. If our batting was different during that period, the result would have been different,” Dhoni said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

Earlier, ‘Birthday Boy’ Dwayne Bravo bowled a perfect final over to finish with figures of 3/37, while the trio of Sam Curran, Shradul Thakur and Karn Sharma claimed two each as CSK bowled KKR out for 167.

“Initially we gave away a few too many with the new ball. Karn (Sharma) did really well. The bowlers did well to bring them down to 160-odd. As a team we should have achieved the target but the batsmen let the bowlers down.”

Dhoni promoted himself at No. 4 but was cleaned up by spinner Varun Chakravarthy, while Sam Curran became Andre Russell’s victim after a brisk 11-ball 17.

“Rotation of strike is always important. At times we have to judge the deliveries. There were hardly any boundaries in the last three overs.

“You have to be slightly innovative in these scenarios. If someone is bowling just back of a length, you have to find a way to hit boundaries. We did not adapt well,” Dhoni said.

Fluid batting order

Having returned to winning ways, KKR skipper Dinesh Karthik was all praise for his team, especially the duo of Sunil Narine (1/31 from four overs) and Andre Russell (1/18 from two overs) for their tidy bowling at the death.

“There are some key players for every team. Narine is one for us. Least we can do is back him. Two-three poor games doesn’t matter,” Karthik said.

Asked about their changed batting order, Karthik said: “Our batting is very fluid. I started at three, today I batted at seven. The way those guys batted at the start, they batted very well.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/oaq0j6/article32798412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KKR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-batsmen-let-the-team-down-should-have-achieved-the-target-dhoni/article32798413.ece

People from the locality complain that crossing and movements of wild boars on roads in these rural areas are resulting in accidents.

After the issue came to its attention, the Forest Department urged the panchayat administrations to take measures to prevent littering of food, vegetable and meat wastes on the sides of roads.

“Several minor accidents were reported in the past due to the movement of wild boars in the panchayats. One such accident was reported last week at Mathvarayapuram,” said a person from Mathvarayapuram.

Vegetable, poultry and meat wastes attract wild boars as they are easy food.

S. Vetrivel, vice-president of Mathvarayapuram village, said large numbers of wild boars lived in bushes on the sides of Masa Orambu stream at the panchayat and they also strayed into nearby farms.

“Efforts will be taken to prevent dumping of waste outside the garbage bins. The location of the bins will also be changed,” he said.

While there were challenges in garment exports, exporters had huge opportunities in healthcare needs. With removal of restrictions, they would be able to book orders without any limit, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/aepc-welcomes-govt-notifications/article32807514.ece

Issues related to quarrel with neighbours over drainage, water, dumping of garbage, problems over collecting water from public tap, problems over monetary transactions and family disputes are taken up with police stations in respective areas and inquiry is held. The issue, when left unattended at an early stage, turns into a major law and order problem leading to assault and sometimes murder.

Rajesh Das, Additional Director-General of Police (Law and Order), who recently assumed office, directed all the Superintendents of Police to reach the doorsteps of complaints and resolve the issues.

After studying the nature of the complaint, the Inspector of Police and his team visits the house of the complainant and conducts inquiry.

242,2020/10/08,Virtual hearing software glitch stalls Delhi HC proceedings for 45 min,"Court masters of several benches said the WebEx platform being used for online proceedings apparently faltered.

Virtual hearings in the Delhi High Court were delayed by nearly 45 minutes on Thursday morning due to a technical fault in the video conferencing software.

The hearings were to start at 10.30 a.m. but commenced around 11.15 a.m.

Court masters of several benches said the WebEx platform being used for online proceedings apparently faltered and they had to face anxious calls from lawyers and litigants. They said courts across the country where the WebEx software was being used were facing this problem.

The Delhi High Court Registrar General’s office also confirmed the software did not work.

When trying to log in to the hearings via the video conference link, a message was displayed: “Cisco WebEx had a problem processing your request. Contact support or your administrator and provide the following error tracking ID: 857FB792F41344E2A77DEB0EC62B8C28_1602135310759.”

Some lawyers reported that the software was facing operational issues in other courts too, like in the Rajasthan High Court and Punjab and Haryana High Court.

WebEx is a software developed by the US-based Cisco WebEx.

Since the courts in the national capital switched to virtual hearings, from March 24 onwards, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they have been using the WebEx platform.

“District officials have been directed not to put up posters anymore and also remove the ones which are currently there,” a Delhi government official told The Hindu.

When asked why the government has decided to end the system, the official said, “Due to stigma connected with the disease and posters outside their houses, people are not coming forward to get tested for the virus, even when they have symptoms. They then go to hospitals only when they become severe and it leads to complications. By not putting up posters, we are trying to encourage more people to get tested for the virus and bring them into the government's monitoring system.”

245,2020/10/08,Saurabh- duping,"A 28-year-old security guard was arrested in connection with a case in which an engineer was duped of approximately ₹28 lakh on the pretext of being given a job opportunity, the police said on Wednesday.

The accused, Pinkesh Kumar, worked as a guard at a housing project in Noida. Two years ago, he came in contact with a person who asked him to provide his bank account details on a commission basis, they said. Insisted by him, Kumar opened accounts in different banks and later withdrew the amount from ATMs. He got 10% of the total withdrawn amount as commission, the police said.

A probe was initiated after a resident of Malviya Nagar approached the police saying she was duped by a man on the pretext of a job offer. The woman is an engineer by profession and was working as a deputy manager with a firm but was looking for another job.

According to her police complaint, in the first week of July this year, she got a Voice-over Internet Protocol (VOIP) call from an online job portal. A man introduced himself as Rahul and told her that her CV was selected by DLF Ltd. After a few days, she got a VIOP call from a person who pretended to be the HR of DLF and told her that she was selected for a senior managerial post and offered a handsome package.

He told her to furnish a bond of ₹28 lakh and asked her to deposit ₹6.8 lakh at first. This way, the man managed to get ₹28 lakh deposited into different bank accounts.

Based on her complaint, a case was registered and during the course of investigation, bank account details of beneficiary accounts and the alleged calling numbers were traced, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said.

With the help of technical analysis of call detail records and local sources, Kumar was apprehended from Parthala Khanjarpur village in Noida Sector 122, he said.

246,2020/10/08,Panchayats to be rewarded for zero crop burning,"Officials to ensure availability of machinery to farmers

Haryana Chief Secretary Vijai Vardhan has directed the Deputy Commissioners to achieve the goal of zero stubble burning and ensure the availability of crop residue management machinery to small and marginal farmers on a priority basis.

Mr. Vardhan said that panchayats falling in the red zone for high number of incidents of farm fires would be rewarded for their performance on crop residue management. The panchayats securing first, second and third positions would be rewarded an amount of ₹10 lakh, ₹5 lakh and ₹3 lakh respectively.

The Chief Secretary said this in a videoconference with the Deputy Commissioners on Wednesday to prevent the burning of crop residues in compliance with the Supreme Court order.

Machinery supply

He also directed the Deputy Commissioners to ensure adequate supply of crop residue management machinery in districts and allocation of 70% machinery to custom hiring centres. Besides, the Chief Secretary also directed the Deputy Commissioners to liaison with industrial units and gaushalas.

He also directed the Deputy Commissioners to send the report of all these activities to the headquarters within three days.

Mr. Vardhan said that every sarpanch should hold a meeting of the Gram Sabha and adopt a resolution to not burn stubble.

Additional Principal Secretary to Chief Minister, V. Umashankar informed that a system has been developed to closely monitor and control the incidence of crop residue burning under which a text message through SMS would be sent twice a day to Sarpanches, Village Secretaries, Deputy Directors, Agriculture Departments, Tehsildars and Deputy Commissioners if stubble was found burning in the range of 100 to 115 metres, based on the satellite image so that the officers concerned can visit the spot and take stock of the situation and implement the next action.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/u3m9f/article32798188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07DELPRIYASTUBBLEBURNING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/panchayats-to-be-rewarded-for-zero-crop-burning/article32798189.ece
247,2020/10/08,CM highlights efforts to tackle climate change,"At global meet, he explains govt.’s plans

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal addressed the ‘Daring Cities 2020’ conference on Wednesday where he spoke on the multilevel action taken by his government to tackle climate change and pollution in the Capital.

Mr. Kejriwal was among the five urban leaders from around the world to speak at the Daring Cities 2020 conference, a global, action-oriented forum to recognise courageous urban leaders taking bold climate action across the world, according to the Delhi government.

Key initiatives

In the last five years, the government had taken several measures to tackle the twin problems, which had resulted in a reduction in pollution by 25% on the average PM 2.5 level, said the Chief Minister. “Some of the main initiatives we took to control this and respond to the climate emergency are introducing odd-even schemes, shutting down thermal power plants, banning the use of polluting fuels, and starting a mega green drive,” he said in his address.

“Delhi is the only city/State in India that has shut down all thermal power plants. Today, we have no coal-based, polluting power plants. We are trying to make a big shift towards renewable energy to address the crisis of climate change and pollution. Last year, we shut down one more thermal power plant. The 45-acre land on which it was located will be used to develop a solar park that will produce 5 MW of electricity,” he also said.

Under the mega green drive, he said, the Delhi government planted more than 3.6 million saplings in 2019-20 and Delhi’s green cover was continuously increasing.

In an effort to devise sustainable solutions to reduce stubble burning, he said, the Delhi government had joined hands with the Indian Agricultural Research Institute to bring in the bio-decomposer technique.

“This year, we are promoting an innovative sustainable technique called the bio-decomposer which involves making a liquid solution and spraying it on the crop stubble. The stubble softens and melts in 20 days and the farmer can then begin with sowing again. This zero-emission solution will greatly help to reduce carbon emissions,” he said.

The Delhi government is also promoting public and non-motorised public transport, he said and the important focus in the next five years would be to double the fleet of public buses and develop a widely accessible, affordable, and integrated public transport system in Delhi.

”Our aim is to make Delhi the EV Capital of the world. The Delhi government has recently notified a very progressive EV policy that will enable a large-scale transition to EV vehicles - 25% of the new vehicles by 2024 will be EVs,” he also said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4abpx5/article32798186.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL08-KEJRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cm-highlights-efforts-to-tackle-climate-change/article32798187.ece
248,2020/10/08,‘Prepare for winter surge of 15K cases a day’,"NCDC report also says virus deaths possibly under-reported

A report prepared by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and submitted to the Delhi government earlier this week states that Delhi should prepare for a surge of 15,000 positive cases per day during the winter months. As many as 2,324 healthcare workers in the city have been infected by COVID-19 and 75 of them have died, says the yet-to-be-made-public ‘Revised Strategy for control of COVID-19 version 3.0’. It also suggests the death figure may be “under-reported”.

The government is expected to come up with a revised strategy based on the report, which was prepared in consultation with an expert group headed by NITI Aayog member V.K Paul. Last month, Lt. Governor Anil Baijal had directed to prepare a revised plan to fight the virus.

“It is recommended that Delhi should prepare for a daily surge of about 15,000 positive cases and make arrangements for inpatient admissions of patients and moderate and severe disease roughly amounting to 20 percent of this surge (sic),” says the report, seen by The Hindu.

Explaining why the Capital should prepare for a surge of 15,000 cases a day, the report says winter months make respiratory illnesses more severe and patients from outside Delhi, who are likely to be “more serious”, may come in “large numbers”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/9gi67e/article32786823.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06DELPRIYACOVIDTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/prepare-for-winter-surge-of-15k-cases-a-day/article32798177.ece
249,2020/10/08,CM ensures relief to city restaurants,"Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday convened a meeting aimed at easing business for those in the restaurant industry here.

A delegation of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), Ministers concerned and officials of various departments and agencies were present at the meeting. “Delhi’s restaurants are the pride of the city and provide employment to lakhs of people. I have directed all the respective departments to remove unnecessary hassles in the smooth running of restaurants,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

Various measures to ensure the introduction of licencing reforms in the restaurant industry were taken up at the meeting under various departments, including the municipal corporations, Delhi Police Licencing Department, Tourism Licence, Excise Reforms, Shops & Establishments, Delhi Fire Service and Delhi Pollution Control Committee among others.

According to the government, the Chief Minister instructed that the health trade licences, which are issued by the municipal corporations to the restaurant industries should be abolished within 10 days.

The NRAI team requested the abolishment of police licences since restaurants are a part of the retail sector and no other retail establishment is required to obtain a police licence.

Mr. Kejriwal assured them that a decision to provide relief to the restaurants from police licences will soon be taken after discussing stakeholders concerned. In addition, a decision was also taken to completely do away with licenses from the Tourism industry to open or run a restaurant.

The Excise Department, the government said, agreed to review the existing policy of a 10% automatic increase in the license fees every year. Excise Minister Manish Sisodia, directed that the restaurants be able to pay their excise by March 31 from the existing deadline of February 28 and for them to make quarterly license fee payments without any interest.

“It was decided that other relevant suggestions related to amendments in Excise regulations will be considered to be included in a new policy currently under preparation, permitting the extension of the operating timings of the restaurants on the weekends till 3 a.m.,” the government stated.

“On the request of restaurateurs to allow 24x7 business, it was agreed that the restaurants will be allowed to operate at all hours subject to the condition that they submit an undertaking that they will take care of the health and security of their entire staff, the government stated,” the government also stated.

On the request of simplifying fire norms for restaurants situated in old and heritage sites it was decided that a technical committee would be constituted which in 10 days will examine ways to enhance fire safety in such locations, without the need to make structural changes to the existing restaurants.

It was also decided that the DPCC will issue a clarification to the civic bodies on permissibility of wood charcoal in the grills and tandoors of the restaurants and to ensure that harassment of the restaurants be stopped on this front.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cm-ensures-relief-to-city-restaurants/article32798172.ece
250,2020/10/08,CPCB points to lacunae in Delhi’s pollution plan,"Nearly 40% complaints by citizens posted via the SAMEER app are unattended

The Central Pollution Control Board has pointed out several “shortcomings” in Delhi’s pollution control plan, according to a letter by the agency’s head to the Delhi government viewed by The Hindu.

The CPCB deployed teams from September 15-21 in known pollution hotspots in the city to check if regulations were being enforced against activities such as dumping of construction and demolition (C&D) waste, whether dust mitigation measures were being undertaken and conducting random audits of pollution-under-control certificates.

Among the lacunae pointed out were that nearly 40% of complaints by citizens posted via the SAMEER app — designed specifically for consumer complaints — were unattended. Thirteen of the most polluted hotspots were expected to furnish action plans and Wazirpur had yet to provide one. The Delhi Jal Board, Public Works Department and Irrigation and Food and Control Department also hadn’t furnished their ‘winter action plans’ and mixed municipal solid waste at the dumpsites in Bhalswa, Ghazipur and Okhla. Nearly all major districts were reporting instances of wanton dumping of C&D waste, roads left unpaved, open burning of garbage, traffic congestion and industrial emissions.

‘More needs to be done’

“Some tasks to curb air pollution in Delhi have been accomplished but more needs to be done,” says the letter signed by Shiv Das Meena, chairman, CPCB and addressed to Vijay Kumar Dev, Chief Secretary, Delhi. On Monday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the Delhi government would be creating a ‘24x7 war room’.

A key prong this year was the use of the bio-decomposer technique developed by the PUSA Research Institute which the Delhi government will be taking to farmers’ doorsteps from Tuesday.

“We have also delineated 13 pollution hotspots for which detailed and specific plans will be made. We are creating the ‘Green Delhi’ app, which will receive complaints of pollution that will need to be taken care of in a time-bound manner,” he had said on Monday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cpcb-points-to-lacunae-in-delhis-pollution-plan/article32798148.ece
251,2020/10/08,Season’s debut for ‘poor’ AQI,"Air quality to dip further in next 3 days

The air quality of the Capital dropped to “poor” category on Wednesday for the first time this season, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.

“The AQI [Air Quality Index] is forecast to deteriorate for the next three days and remain in poor category with increasing magnitude until October 10,” government-run monitoring agency SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research) said in a statement.

Fire counts aggregated over Punjab, Haryana, and neighbouring border regions were 336 on Tuesday. Also, the boundary layer wind direction and speed are favourable for slow transport from external emission sources to the city and local conditions are also conducive for accumulation of pollutants in the city, as per SAFAR.

The AQI of the city was 215 on Wednesday as per CPCB. The air quality has turned poor after more than three months of relatively better air. The AQI was in the moderate category till Tuesday and was expected to drop to the poor category this week.

Strict actions

Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday said that there will be strict implementation of anti-dust drive to control air pollution. He also said that farmers can sow seeds after about five days of spraying the bio-decomposer on stubble and do not have to wait for 20-25 days.

About a real-time source apportionment study conducted by the Washington University, Mr. Rai said, a report has been submitted to the Delhi government and a three-member committee appointed by the government is analysing it.

Meanwhile, AAP national spokesperson, Raghav Chadha, said that States of Punjab and Haryana are guilty of “criminal negligence” towards the matter of air pollution and they have not taken any serious comprehensive steps to stop stubble burning. “Aam Aadmi Party demands that the Supreme Court-appointed EPCA ought to take stringent action against Punjab and Haryana for neglecting the stubble burning issue,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/seasons-debut-for-poor-aqi/article32798146.ece
252,2020/10/08,‘Reply to plea challenging classification of law offices’,"Delhi High Court issues order to municipal corporations

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought response of the three municipal corporations of the national capital on a petition by the Delhi High Court Bar Association (DHCBA) challenging classification of law offices as “commercial activity” for the purposes of calculation of property tax under the Delhi Municipal Act.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan asked the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, East Delhi Municipal Corporation and North Delhi Municipal Corporation for their stand on the petition.

The DHCBA’s petition stated, “A professional activity like an advocate is not a business and cannot be deemed as a commercial activity and as such, the non-residential rates would not apply in the case of an advocate using premises for an office”.

It explained that the municipal corporation of Delhi attributes a use factor to a building depending upon its purpose. The use factor varies from, 1 (for residential purpose and public purpose) to 10 for star hotels (3 stars and above).

The use factor for industry, entertainment, recreation and clubs has been specified as 3 and that of utilities and business as 2 and 4 respectively.

The Bar Council of Delhi had sent a representation on July 21, 2020 to the civic corporations for reduction of use factor 4 to 1 for levy of property tax in respect of offices of advocates in Delhi.

“The respondents [civic corporations] being the assessing authority has conveniently ignored the law laid down by the apex court regarding profession of advocates which by no stretch of imagination comes in the category of commercial enterprise, industrial, mercantile, shop or business venture,” the petition stated.

“A lawyer does not render services, conduct business or commercial activities. It is submitted that a lawyer is only an instrument to bring home justice for a litigant,” the plea said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/reply-to-plea-challenging-classification-of-law-offices/article32798132.ece

254,2020/10/08,Next three months crucial in Capital’s COVID fight: report,"‘Isolation in thickly populated areas may have spread infection’

A report prepared by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says “the next three months are crucial in our battle” against COVID-19 with multiple festivals such as Diwali, Chhath Puja, Dussehra, and Id lined up.

The report says 2,324 healthcare workers in the Capital have been infected by COVID-19 and 75 have died so far. Out of the 2,324 cases, 34% are nurses, 23% doctors, 15% paramedics, 18% Group D staff and 10% others, according to the report. “The increasing mortality in HCW (healthcare workers) and doctors is detrimental for maintaining the morale of these COVID warriors. Hence all efforts should be undertaken to prevent the healthcare-associated infection in all the hospitals, labs, and field workers,” states the report.

Containment zones

The report states that the percentage of cases from containment zones varied from 15-20% in districts and 80% were outside the zones. Of the total positive people, 30% were in different government facilities and 50-55% were in home isolation.

“Formation of new containment zones could be restricted only for highly dense localities such as resettlement colonies and JJ clusters/slum areas,” says the report. If the government considers this recommendation, then this could greatly change the number of containment zones in the city.

The report also states that home isolation was observed in “densely populated areas” as well and with the number of cases in thousands, this “may be one of the reasons for the spread of infection”.

“All symptomatic positive cases reported from densely populated areas should be isolated only in CCC (COVID Care Centre) to ensure optimal utilization of CCC facilities,” the report recommends.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/next-three-months-crucial-in-capitals-covid-fight-report/article32798126.ece
255,2020/10/08,Delhi HC declines plea on guidelines on tuition fee,"Plea seeks break-up of fees, concession

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday declined a petition seeking guidelines to universities and such institutions to charge only the tuition fee, that too in instalments, in view of the COVID-19 crisis.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan asked the authorities concerned to treat the plea as a representation and take a decision in accordance with law and government policy applicable to the facts of the case.

The Bench said that universities have to pay their professors and also set up the infrastructure for online classes and therefore, they cannot be directed to grant fee concessions. “Such petition deserves to be dismissed with costs, but we are not doing it now,” the Bench said while disposing of the plea.

The law student, in his plea, had sought directions from the Ministry of Education to various universities and such institutions to give a break-up of the fees being charged by them and to also grant concessions to parents on a case-to-case basis in the form of extension of time period to deposit the fees.

The petition had also sought framing of guidelines to ensure the varsities provide gadgets and fast internet connections to those who cannot afford the same so that all students have access to online education or classes being held during the pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-hc-declines-plea-on-guidelines-on-tuition-fee/article32798120.ece
256,2020/10/08,Delhi cinema halls to open from October 15,"All weekly markets to begin operations immediately

Cinema halls and weekly markets will be allowed to reopen in the Capital according to the latest unlock guidelines issued by the Centre, said an order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday.

The order, dated October 6, and released in the name of Delhi Chief Secretary Vijay Dev, stated that theatres can open from October 15 with 50% capacity while all weekly markets can open with immediate effect.

The relaxations do not apply to containment zones.

The Delhi government attributed the order to the ‘persistent efforts’ of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

“Now all weekly markets of Delhi will open. Till now only two markets per zone were allowed. The poor will get a lot of relief from this. Cinema halls of Delhi will also be opened from October 15. They have to follow all the guidelines issued by the Central government,” Mr. Kejriwal tweeted.

Earlier, the DDMA had ordered a status quo regarding relaxation of restrictions in the city.

SOP compliance

The reopening of cinema halls will be subject to “strict compliance” of the SOP for Exhibition of Films on preventive measures to contain spread of COVID-19, as well as other directions/instructions issued by the Delhi government and the DDMA.

257,2020/10/08,BJP warns of sit-in protest outside CM’s residence,"Bidhuri accuses it of making false promises to farmers

The Opposition BJP on Wednesday warned the Delhi government of a sit-in protest outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence featuring representatives from the 365 villages of Delhi, starting October 17 if promises made by him to farmers were not fulfilled.

Leader of the Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri also accused the Delhi government of making false promises to the farmers.

“If this government does not fulfil its promises to the farmers, the BJP Legislature Party will sit on a dharna at the residence of the Chief Minister with farmer representatives of 365 villages of Delhi from October 17,” Mr. Bidhuri said.

“The Aam Aadmi Party promised the farmers that the Delhi government, under the Chief Minister Kisan Mitra Yojana, will pay ₹776 and ₹897 per quintal respectively on wheat and rice than the fixed Minimum Support Price of the Central government and the Swaminathan report will also be implemented,” Mr. Bidhuri also said.

Additional burden

According to Mr. Bidhuri, an additional burden of about ₹100 crore was estimated on the government exchequer of Delhi but till date no farmer has been paid on the increased MSP nor the report of the Swaminathan Commission has been implemented, he alleged.

The AAP, he said, had also promised to provide cheap electricity to the farmers while today they were being given “the most expensive” electricity.

“Similarly, the promise to allow tubewells in the fields also proved to be false, alternative residential plots given to farmers in lieu of their acquisition of land were not given to them, compensation for the land of the farmers of Delhi was also not increased,” he alleged.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-warns-of-sit-in-protest-outside-cms-residence/article32798093.ece
258,2020/10/08,Retired Lt. Colonel arrested for duping armymen of ₹88 lakh,"Accused induced his targets to invest in residential plots

A retired Lt. Colonel was arrested for allegedly cheating army personnel on the pretext of providing them residential plots, the police said on Wednesday.

The accused has been identified as Rakesh Rana, a resident of Dwarka’s Sector-18A. He was previously involved in two criminal cases, they said.

The police said one Havaldar Chandan Kumar, along with other army personnel, alleged that they have been cheated by SWO-India Ltd., to the tune of around ₹88 lakh.

They alleged that the accused showed them rosy pictures of the ‘Veer Aawas Bokaro Project’ and assured that they were running an NGO in the name of SWO-India for the benefit of army personnel. It was also told that no-profit motive was there in the projects.

The investors were asked to deposit money in SWO India Ltd. The company, through its official, ensured that they would provide residential plots to the investors at Bokaro in Jharkhand, the police said. Assured by the accused, the victims invested money in the plots.

During investigation, it was revealed that Rana induced the army personnel that the whole project was on a 20-acre land and the land had been purchased and necessary approvals had been taken, a senior police officer said. The company provided an allocation-letter-cum-agreement on the receipt of the total amount, but it neither provided the plots, nor returned their money. Even the company has no land and requisite approval from authority concerned, the police said.

“During investigation, it was revealed that Rana, retired Lt. Colonel, Kirti Chakra Vijeta, was the mastermind. He was arrested on Tuesday from one of his residences at Dwarka. He was also the authorised signatory of various accounts of the company,” Joint CP (EOW) O.P.

259,2020/10/08,Karat moves court over ‘hate speeches’ issue,"Plea likely to come up for hearing today

CPI(M) leader Brinda Karat has moved the Delhi High Court against a trial court order which rejected her plea for lodging an FIR against Union Minister Anurag Thakur and MP Pravesh Verma for their alleged hate speeches in relation to anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh here.

The petition is likely to come up for hearing before Justice Yogesh Khanna on Thursday.

The trial court had on August 26 rejected her plea for registration of FIR against the BJP leaders on the ground that the requisite sanction from the competent authority, the Central government, was not obtained.

The trial court had stated that prior sanction of competent authority – Central government – is required as per section 196 the Code of Criminal Procedure at the stage of ordering of registration of FIR as both Mr. Thakur and Mr. Verma are MPs.

Ms. Karat’s plea contended that when the State and the police have pointedly excused the speeches of the accused and other persons, the only recourse available to her was judicial.

The judicial recourse has been barred by the trial court without considering that the very State that is supportive of the accused persons would function as the Sanctioning Authority, the plea argued.

Ms. Karat had sought registration of FIR against Mr. Thakur and Mr. Verma under Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/karat-moves-court-over-hate-speeches-issue/article32798082.ece
260,2020/10/08,"Transcript collection long drawn out, say DU graduates","They complain of lack of information on varsity’s website

Delhi University graduates, who queued up at the South Campus on Wednesday to collect transcripts, complained of the process being long drawn and time-consuming specially with several of them applying to universities abroad.

Stating that one is required to visit the centre “at least four to five times” before the transcript is ready, they also complained of the lack of information on the varsity’s website regarding the process.

While last month the university had informed the Delhi High Court that it was “willing to devise a mechanism for urgent requests,” several of those lined up at the centre were unaware of the direction.

Vaani Sharma (name changed), who graduated from Lady Shri Ram College in 2018, said: “I have not looked up for the online method yet and anyway DU has been fairly unreliable with technology. This is the fourth time I am coming to this centre. The list of documents provided is also vague and everyday they ask for a new document.”

The Lucknow resident added: “There is a lot of miscommunication. Nowhere on the website is it mentioned that the centre will remain open on alternate days. I visited the centre on Tuesday only to find it shut. This is very difficult for someone like me who is not a city resident.”

Multiple trips

For Anil Kumar, a resident of Palam, who was at the window to collect his son’s transcript, it was his fifth visit. “My son graduated from Ram Lal Anand college in 2013 and now we need the transcript as he is applying abroad. Nothing seems to move here unless one makes multiple trips. If we are coming after a month to collect it, then at least keep the thing ready. Usually transcripts are needed urgently. What is the point of making someone wait for two months?”

Mr. Kumar added, “Even government work is done online these days. Instead here we wait endlessly.”

Vandana Sapra, who graduated from Sri Venkateswara college in 2019 said: “As of now I have not come across any online mode. I paid the fees online but for submission and attestation of documents we had to come to the campus. It has been a month since I paid the fees and now I have been asked to wait for sometime before I can collect the transcript.”

Saloni Singh (name changed) waiting for her daughter’s transcript added: “My daughter, who graduated in 2018, studied life sciences and now wants to apply abroad. We live in north Delhi and it is a hassle to keep making trips to South Campus for the transcript. But we do not have any other option at the moment. We are also not aware of any provision to apply for online transcripts and hence did not apply for the same.”

In its affidavit to the Delhi HC, the university had said that an online mechanism could not be devised for those who graduated before 2017 as printing of degrees had already been undertaken and sent to the respective colleges.

High Court order

The HC in its September 28 order had said, “Let the mechanism devised for issuance of urgent transcripts and the details thereof be placed on record before the next date of hearing.”

The varsity had also informed the court that out of a total of 1,788 applications received with an urgency request, 1,728 degree certificates had already been issued and 450 online degree certificates are being generated on a daily basis.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/transcript-collection-long-drawn-out-say-du-graduates/article32798071.ece
261,2020/10/08,Notice to EC on petition by Bhim Army chief,"Chandra Shekhar has sought registration of his political party

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday issued notice to Election Commission on a plea by Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Azad seeking registration of his political party, Azad Samaj Party (Kansi Ram), before the end of filing period for nomination of Assembly elections in Bihar.

Justice Jayant Nath asked the poll panel to respond to Mr. Azad’s plea seeking to reduce the mandatory 30-day period for inviting objections from the public before registration of his party to seven days.

Mr. Azad, in his plea, stated that the election commission had on September 22 approved the name, Azad Samaj Party (Kashi Ram), following which on September 25 and 26 he got published public notices on two national and two local newspapers inviting objections.

Meanwhile, the Election Commission announced the dates for Bihar election, with the first phase to begin from October 28. In the petition filed through advocate Mohan Shyam Arya, Mr. Azad said that his party will contest the Bihar election on all seats. Hence, if the poll panel does not issue the certificate of registration and allot the symbol of the party for the present election, his party may “suffer irreparable losses”.

Mr. Shekhar has urged the High Court for a direction to the poll panel to reduce the service period of 30 days to seven days for inviting objections.

The High Court will hear the case on October 20.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/notice-to-ec-on-petition-by-bhim-army-chief/article32798064.ece

263,2020/10/08,Hindu Rao doctors go on strike over non-payment of salary,"Nurses also join the 3-hour daily ‘symbolic indefinite strike’

Resident doctors at the civic body run Hindu Rao Hospital in north Delhi have resorted to a three-hour daily “symbolic indefinite strike” in response to the non-payment of salaries for the last three months.

The group of doctors was joined by nurses of the hospital, who too have not been paid their salaries for several months.

Hindu Rao Hospital, the largest municipal hospital in Delhi with 900 beds, is currently a dedicated COVID-19 facility and many of its healthcare workers have contracted the virus since the pandemic began. Since it is a dedicated COVID-19 facility, medical services, according to the striking medical workers, will not be essentially affected. Doctors, who are not on rotational duty, will join the strike for the three hour duration, they said.

“We are on a symbolic indefinite strike to make our voices heard to authorities, who have not responded to our appeal so far. We have been doing the symbolic pen down from 9 a.m. to noon for the last several days as well as online protests, but no one listened to us,” said Abhimanyu Sardana, president of the Resident Doctors’ Association of the facility.

“We are humans too and have a family to run. We are risking our lives for humanity. Is it too much to ask for our due salaries,” Dr. Sardana asked.

North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash had recently said the civic body was doing “everything possible to resolve the issue”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/t76csi/article32798035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07DELPRIYAHINDURAOPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hindu-rao-doctors-go-on-strike-over-non-payment-of-salary/article32798036.ece

Delhi Police has revealed the names and addresses of 15 protected witnesses in the chargesheet they submitted in the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act case registered in connection with the Delhi riots that broke out in February. Police said the act was “inadvertent”.

Delhi Police Spokesperson said: “During the course of investigation, it was deemed necessary that the identities of some witnesses should not be disclosed in the public domain. However, a court-related document containing the identities of some of these witnesses has been inadvertently included in the copies of the chargesheet provided to the accused persons as part of compliance of judicial orders.”

Ensure safety

Police further said that the witnesses are court-protected and steps are being taken to ensure the safety and security of these witnesses and “to address all concerns in this regard”.

Special Cell had submitted the chargesheet in court in the third week of September, which was further submitted to accused’s lawyers a few days later.

The document on 15 public witnesses, including four Hindus and 11 Muslims, mentions their names along with addresses against their pseudonym and dates on which their statements were recorded before the police and the magistrate. The pseudonyms given include Omega, Victor, Charlie, Gama, Delta, Echo among others. The document also states that the identities of these public witnesses be concealed during the proceedings of the case.

The directions came when the green panel was hearing the plea which alleged unscientific disposal of biomedical waste.

266,2020/10/08,NGT raps GMDA over storm water drains,"Chief Secretary asked to take action

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has pulled up the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) over improper maintenance of storm water drains and has directed the Haryana Chief Secretary to take appropriate steps and monitor the situation.

Taking note of a report furnished by authorities, a Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumat Goel said, “The report does not show any arrangement to prevent untreated sewage being discharged into the drains till June 2021 or even till December 2021, till the proposed work of setting up capacity for treatment is completed.”

“It is stated that the proposal [to create a natural wetland] submitted by Jamia Milia Islamia University is not being considered. There is no other proposal for preventing untreated sewage from being discharged into the drains. Thus, the law will continue to be violated and untreated sewage continue to be discharged in the waterbodies, though it is a criminal offence under the law of land,” the Bench observed.

The GMDA, in its report, had said that discharge of untreated sewage will be stopped by June 2021, which may be further delayed due to the ongoing pandemic.

‘No justification’

The green panel also suggested that there should be a single coordinating agency for the treatment of sewage and observed that there was “no justification” for constructing covered stormwater drains that obstruct natural flow.

For London Olympics bronze medallist and ace shooter Gagan Narang, it was an irresistible invite as the chief guest of the Elephants Rejuvenation programme at Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve during his recent trip.

The 37-year-old Gagan was at the reserve for the ‘Samapan Samaroh’, the closing segment of the programme.

“It is a nice feeling to be in the jungle, in the midst of these magnificent wild animals. It is a whole different kind of world. And especially because of the pandemic, it is so refreshing mentally too,” said Gagan, who also contributed in his own way for the programme and for the well-being of the staff in the reserve, including the mahouts, who also assemble for the event.

“This is different from adopting any animal. It is more of a symbolic gesture to be out there. Being an avid wildlife and nature lover, I thought it was one of the better ways to be away from the madding crowd,” Gagan said.

And, the World Cup champion, himself being a brilliant photographer too, took time to have a feel of the reserve and was apparently delighted to go around the reserve which he says is full of the typical, magical monsoon greens.

270,2020/10/08,Teesta backs collective action against ‘Hindutva fascism’,"Forge alliances to fight proto fascist state, dispel hate propaganda: activist

Renowned human rights activist Teesta Setalvad emphasised the need for collective action against Hindutva fascism by building inter-sectional alliances across various oppressed groups and individuals.

Delivering the 11th Balagopal Memorial Lecture online on the topic ‘State of our Republic’, Ms. Setalvad advocated taking a leaf out of the country’s history of Shramanic fight against Brahminism, in order to forge alliances and understanding among various groups to fight what she termed as the ‘proto fascist’ state.

Constitutional values such as equality, right to freedom and right to life are not foreign concepts as denounced by the right wing, but are embedded in the soil of the South Asian sub-continent.

Invoking Buddha, Mahavir, Charvakas, Lokayat tradition, dissenters such as Basavanna, Narayan guru, Periyar, and Sufi and Bhakti traditions, Ms. Setalvad said questioning, resistance, and organising have always been part of the Indian tradition.

“We need to really spend some time in building these deeper understandings and translating these deeper understandings into collective action, long term collective action, where hate propaganda needs to be dispelled within the family, within the mohalla, within the society, within caste, within unions, within farmers’ organisations, within women’s organisations, everywhere,” she said.

Observing that the Indian Constitution and constitutional values are being hollowed out every day and that the attack is on multiple fronts, Ms. Setalvad cited several instances such as the verdict on Babri Masjid demolition, gang rape of a Dalit girl in Hathras, and the state’s response to it in denying her dignified last rites, spree of arrests of activists and students, abrogation of Article 370, passing of CAA in Parliament, attempts to force NRC on people, and orchestration of Delhi riots.

Application of discriminatory governance and law stemmed from a ‘proto fascist’ ideology espoused by the RSS and Hindu Mahasabha, which drew not from more eclectic and inclusive Hinduism, but from the most rigid form of Hindutva advocated by the likes of V.D. Savarkar, who in turn were inspired by Mussolini’s Italy and Hitler’s Germany.

This ideology seeks to convert the Indian Constitutional Republic into an autocratic, discriminatory, theocratic state, by vitiating law and its institutional structures.

Citing passage of money bills, farmers’ bills, labour laws, and environmental laws, she alleged that Parliament is being used to demolish the Constitutional morality and law, thereby thwarting people’s will.

Criminal law is being invoked against Muslims, Christians, communists — all-encompassing term for dissenters — who speak against the Prime Minister or Home Minister or Uttar Pradesh’s Chief Minister. This has never happened in India, she said.

Electronic media is acting as genocide-enabler by becoming the vehicle for targeting specific groups, she said, terming it a Goebbelsian phenomenon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ekdspd/article32809227.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tee,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/teesta-backs-collective-action-against-hindutva-fascism/article32807161.ece

272,2020/10/08,NIPER designs nebulizer-based inhalation therapy to fight COVID,"We are working with regulatory authorities to get clearance: NIPER director

The National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), Hyderabad, is working with regulatory authorities to get approval for a nebulizer-based inhalation therapy it has designed for use in COVID patients.

The inhalation therapy for combating COVID-19 is very effective. “We are working with regulatory authorities to get clearance. We have done some clinical studies and hopefully, we will be getting a nod for conducting phase I human trials,” NIPER Hyderabad director Shashi Bala Singh said on Wednesday.

Addressing a virtual conference ‘Pharm-Exe’ organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) with IMT Hyderabad, Ms. Singh mentioned the therapy as well as the re-purposing of two drugs, another project of NIPER, in the context of the need for enhanced industry-academia collaboration.

A release from CII said Ms. Singh said that 30% of the research in India is being conducted as part of industry-academia collaboration whereas globally it is close to 80%.

The Pharm-Exe conference on ‘Towards a self-reliant India and pharmacy of the world’ was inaugurated by Health Minister Eatala Rajender. Stating that Telangana is known as the bulk drug capital of India and accounts for 40% of the total bulk drug production in the country, the Minister said that the State supplied some of the vital drugs and other anti-viral drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in sufficient quantity.

Life sciences sector in the State is also poised to play a major role in developing COVID-19 vaccines and their bulk manufacturing. The State government with its progressive TS-iPASS policy and projects such as the proposed Pharma City will continue to support the industry, he said.

Vice-chairman and CEO of Natco Pharma Rajeev Nannapaneni said it is very critical for Indian pharma players to identify and focus on one or two key pharma products and work towards a global position with a significant market share.

CII leaders Krishna Bodanapu and Sameer Goel and IMT Hyderabad director M. Venkateshwarlu spoke in the inaugural session. The release said IMT Hyderabad is partnering with CII Telangana to commence a study on implications of COVID-19 on businesses in Telangana in key sectors such as IT, healthcare, tourism and pharma.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/niper-designs-nebulizer-based-inhalation-therapy-to-fight-covid/article32807148.ece
273,2020/10/08,Disabled students getting used to the new normal,"Smartphones, audio tapes sent to students to study at home

Out of the myriad unforeseen changes that COVID-19 has brought into our lives is the way education is imparted to children. The sight of children squirming in chairs and sofas at home while attending online classes has become quite ubiquitous. But what about the visually impaired?

Teachers at the Devnar School for the Blind, Begumpet, are relying on the sharp memory and hearing ability of students with visual impairment to take classes. Audio tapes of academic lessons are sent through Whatsapp and in the case of students of classes IX and X, Braille text books are sent home.

Earlier, apart from learning in classrooms, students with partial or complete visual impairment used to learn with the help of computers or other digital screens at school, like screen readers, while using the Braille slate and stylus to write. Since they are now staying at home and do not have access to these resources, the school’s management is relying on smartphones.

“We have provided 20 phones to families not able to afford with the help of donors,” said founder and chairman of Devnar Foundation for the Blind Dr. A. Saibaba Goud.

How do the boys make use of this new situation? “We use the screen reader software to access classes. Once we reach the home page in the phone, the screen reader suggests we tap it twice to open Whatsapp. If I tap on science group, the audio lesson plays,” says 13-year-old Y. Nagaraju of Class IX.

A Xth standard student R. Devender Reddy says that though they initially faced difficulty, they have got used to this form of education now. “The biggest advantage is we can download and hear the classes whenever we want to,” he points out.

G. Hogla, a teacher at the school, said that students are encouraged to send their doubts in audio form as it helps them practice for final exams.

“During exams, they have to dictate answers to a scribe, so this practice helps our students,” says Mrs. Hogla. For those with hearing impairment, hearing aids are used. Online classes have staggered timings for the benefit of students staying away in far off villages, having internet issues and because the lone smartphone could be used by other family members. “Therefore, it is not fair to hold classes at a fixed time. In any case, we are available to our students over the phone throughout the day,” says Y. Devender Reddy, another teacher.

Braille text books have been distributed to all class IX and X students. It was restricted to these two classes because of the huge costs involved in printing, admin officer V. Ramakrishna said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/1y9jin/article32807143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy08Blind,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/disabled-students-getting-used-to-the-new-normal/article32807136.ece
274,2020/10/08,Why is govt. seeking private property details: Jagga Reddy,"‘Give property details of Chief Minister, Ministers, MLAs and bureaucrats so that people can be convinced about the idea’

Congress MLA of Sangareddy T. Jayaprakash Reddy has questioned the government’s intention asking people to furnish their property details for incorporation in Dharani portal and alleged that the data could be compromised.

Speaking to reporters here, he said the government should also take details on the loans owed by the people to institutions and individuals while seeking to divulge the details of properties.

He felt there is a motive behind collecting the personal property details of people when they were available with the sub-registrar offices and with local body authorities.

Stating that such a huge decision should have been taken after putting the idea for discussion and debate among the public and experts, he said he wanted to question the government on this in the Assembly, but he was not given any opportunity. Public opinion should be sought first on such a massive decision, he argued.

To instil confidence among the people, the government should first start uploading the property details of the Chief Minister, Ministers, MLAs, IAS and IPS officers, he said so that people can be convinced about the idea. The entire exercise looks faulty and is bound to create more problems for the people in future, he claimed.

Mr. Reddy said people were worried that the government wants to misuse the data to target them in the future and also cut down the government benefits. People buy properties with life long savings and they don’t want to put that data for manipulation, he claimed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/9rufil/article32807072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09JJAGGAREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/why-is-govt-seeking-private-property-details-jagga-reddy/article32807073.ece
275,2020/10/08,TS farmers likely to reap rich harvest this season,"Production of food crops could go beyond one crore tonnes, says official of the Agriculture Department

With favourable seasonal conditions on their side in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on sourcing inputs, the farming community of Telangana is set to reap a rich harvest this Vanakalam (Kharif) season as officials of the planning department have estimated the crop production of about 179.4 lakh tonnes including nearly 98 lakh tonnes for food crops.

According to the first advance estimates of crop production prepared by the Bureau of Economics and Statistics (BES) for the first crop season of 2020-21 agricultural year, the production of all major food crops, except that of maize which is cultivated on lesser extent compared to previous years on the advice of the State government, such as paddy, red gram, soya bean and jowar is expected to go up considerably this season.

Record jump

Among the non-food crops, the production of cotton is expected to see a record jump although the difference in the extent of cultivation is only about 6 lakh acres higher this year at about 60.22 lakh acres against nearly 54.46 lakh acres last year. The planning authorities have estimated the production of cotton at 99.53 lakh bales of 170 kg each against the production of nearly 60 lakh bales last year. It is expected to cross one crore bales given the fact that the fibre crop has been cultivated in 60.22 lakh acres extent against 59.58 lakh acres taken into consideration by the officials while estimating the production.

“Production of paddy, which is estimated at 125.46 lakh tonnes from 50.19 lakh acres is expected to cross that threshold too as the actual extent has been over 52.56 lakh acres against the extent taken into consideration by the planning authorities,” a senior official of the Agriculture Department said that total production of food crops could very well cross one-crore tonnes.

Similarly, the production of red gram is estimated at about 8.44 lakh tonnes from the cultivation of the crop in 10.55 lakh acres. Last year, the production was only about 1.9 lakh tonnes from over 7.38 lakh acres of cultivation. This season, the crop is cultivated in nearly 10.77 lakh acres against 10.55 lakh acres taken into count by the BES officials while preparing the advance estimates of production.

Another major food crop soya bean is expected to give a production of 3.42 lakh tonnes from 3.95 lakh acres of cultivation. The final extent of the crop, however, is nearly 4 lakh acres this season. Its production was 2.74 lakh tonnes from nearly 4.27 lakh acres of cultivation during the last Kharif season.

The BES officials have also estimated the production of jowar at 53,000 tonnes, black gram 21,000 tonnes, green gram 22,000 tonnes, maize 4.7 lakh tonnes, groundnut 41,000 tonnes, sugarcane 15.78 lakh tonnes, turmeric 2.54 lakh tonnes, chilli 4.1 lakh tonnes and onion 38,000 tonnes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/9y6609/article32807037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy09paddycol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ts-farmers-likely-to-reap-rich-harvest-this-season/article32807038.ece
276,2020/10/08,Congress protests outside Home Minister’s house,"Mahmood Ali’s resignation sought over rising atrocities against women in the State

Congress party led by AICC secretary A. Sampath Kumar, Youth Congress president Anil Kumar Yadav and NSUI president Venkat Balamoor staged a protest at Home Minister Mahmood Ali’s residence in Banjara Hills demanding his resignation against the ‘rising’ atrocities against women in the State.

Tension prevailed as the Congress leaders and workers tried to barge into the residence but could not as the gates were closed. As they were informed that the Home Minister was not inside, they sat on a dharna in front of the house.

Mr. Sampath Kumar alleged that Telangana was turning into another Uttar Pradesh and the recent rape of a dalit girl in Khammam and the government’s failure to even console her family was an indication of the situation.

Similarly, another girl in Moinabad was killed and a ruling party leader was behind it, he claimed.

It was unfortunate that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao held a meeting with the police officials and claimed Telangana was safe, Mr. Sampath Kumar said. The gathered workers raised slogans against the government and also demanded the resignation of the Home Minister.

The protesting leaders and the cadre were arrested and shifted to Goshamahal police station. The Home Minister called Mr. Sampath and assured that action would be taken against the culprits involved in atrocities against women.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/congress-protests-outside-home-ministers-house/article32807012.ece
277,2020/10/08,OU PG exams from Oct 19,"Students can change exam centres

The fourth semester exams of all the postgraduate courses of Osmania University will be conducted from October 19 to 23.

These exams include the regular, backlog and improvement exams. As per the timetable of the OU paper-I will be held on October 19 and the exams will conclude with paper V on October 23. The detailed timetable is issued and available on OU website.

University authorities said that students experiencing any symptoms of COVID 19 like cold, fever and cough should inform the chief superintendent. At the same time, students attending the exam will have to wear the masks throughout the exam apart from carrying their personal sanitizers.

Controller of Exams Venkatesh Sriram said that the exams will be held in the conventional mode and the time of examination is reduced from three hours to two hours. Accordingly the question paper pattern will be changed and more choices will be given as one-time measure for the academic year 2019-2020. This will be applicable to backlog candidates as well.

In view of COVID-19 pandemic, the university is decided to constitute the PG examination centres at certain district headquarters outside the Osmania University jurisdiction so that the students who are now residing in their native places can take the test at the nearest district centre.

Students can change the present exam centre and choose the nearest exam centre through the weblink ‘http://pg.ouexams.in’ by following a due procedure before October 12 midnight. The details of centre in selected district and town will be sent to registered mobile after allotment of the centre.

Students who do not exercise any option will have to appear for the examinations in the respective centres allotted by the university. And if the number of candidates opted in a particular centre is less than 20, the university may allot another centre to such students.

The centres to be allowed outside the jurisdiction of Osmania University include Warangal, Khammam, Nirmal, Mancherial, Mahabubnagar, Wanaparthy, Nalgonda, Kodad, Karimnagar, Jagityal, Nizamabad and Kamareddy.

The university also said that students who will not be able to appear for all examinations for reasons of health or other unavoidable situations another special examination will be conducted as and when feasible.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ou-pg-exams-from-oct-19/article32806789.ece
278,2020/10/08,Water flow hit by human intervention,"Many structures have come up in the catchment areas of two lakes in twin cities

On top of the Damagundam ridge near Vikarabad at an elevation of 700 metres above sea level, the green valley presents stunning views. On the ridge, a farmer has used an earthmover to clear a path for water to flow down the hill to the lake. The farmer lives in Pudur village and the water will fill a lake whose overflow would emerge as a stream and merge with other streams to reach the Himayatsagar reservoir on the outskirts of Hyderabad. Experts now say that it is this fiddling with the water flow that has affected the spread of both Himayatsagar and Osmansagar lakes and the water quality.

“When the twin reservoirs were built there was a clear command by the ruler that additional water-holding structures will not be built. But that rule was broken after National Watershed Development Programme commenced in 1990s,” says B.V. Subba Rao of the Centre for Climate Change at the Engineering Staff College of India.

According to an estimate, there are 70 educational facilities, 35 mineral water bottling plants, and 790 check dams in the catchment areas of Himayatsagar and Osmansagar. “The result is disruption of both surface, sub-surface flow and water table,” says Mr. Rao who believes in the sustainability of water use from the dams for drinking water needs owing to their low carbon footprint.

A number of farm houses have been built by politicians, film stars and celebrities right up to Aziznagar area, sending land prices soaring. These high-walled structures have further disrupted the natural water channels called by the locals orrey (stream), vagu (rivulet), cheruvu (lake), and nadi (river). This has impacted the lakes which now require ever more quantities of rain to fill up.

“Water flows east as well as west from the Damagundam ridge. Owing to high land prices, many buildings are coming up around water bodies like Sarpanpally lake. Other water bodies are also being filled up and have impacted water channels,” says Venkatesh Goteti who lives near Pudur village.

“The Himayatsagar got filled up quickly this year owing to two days of rain in the Shamshabad area. The water channels have been disturbed by unprecedented construction activity,” says D. Narasimha Reddy who works in the field of environment and development. “Even if this water is released into the Musi river it will not be cleaned up. It will only distribute the pollution and will spread downstream at a great velocity,” he says.

Despite the talk about water being released from the reservoir a few days ago, it was only filled to one third of the capacity. The capacity of the 1920 Osman Sagar is now filled to one third of the capacity.

The 3.9 tmcft was 1.038 tmcft on October 6 and the stored water is being used for drinking water needs of the city.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/dsgmtg/article32806776.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy08anantgirrange-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/water-flow-hit-by-human-intervention/article32806777.ece

Left parties, the CPI and the CPI (Marxist) in particular, are yet to take a final stand on the upcoming elections to the two graduates’ constituencies in the Legislative Council.

The two parties have in principle decided to extend their support to Prof. K. Nageshwar, who is contesting as an Independent from the Hyderabad-Rangareddy-Mahbubnagar constituency. But, they have not yet arrived at a decision on whether they should field a common candidate from the Nalgonda-Khammam-Warangal constituency or extend support to any other party/independents.

The two parties are firm that split in the Left vote, which has good presence in Nalgonda and Khammam districts, should be avoided to the maximum extent possible so that it could benefit the candidates fielded by the Left or those supported by them.

The two Left parties have concluded preliminary discussions on the issue, but are yet to take any concrete decision.

282,2020/10/08,Congress fears enrolment with fake degree certificates for MLC elections,"Demand door-to-door verification of certificates by officials

Telangana Congress is apprehensive of the enrolment of bogus voters using fake degree certificates for the upcoming Graduate MLC elections and urged election officials, on Wednesday, to put in place a strong mechanism to verify the certificates physically.

In a memorandum to the State Election Commissioner (SEC), chairman Marri Shashidhar Reddy and convenor G. Niranjan of the TPCC Election Commission Coordination Committee said that since voters were being asked to enrol online and upload their degree certificates, there was a greater chance of misuse and fake certificates used for enrolment.

They alleged that the ruling TRS was desperate to win the elections and going by the previous experiences, there was a greater chance of such fake voters emerging. They alleged that TRS has a ‘dubious distinction’ of tinkering with the purity of electoral rolls right from 2015 onwards.

The Congress had drawn the attention to large-scale illegal deletions in 2015 and for the first time in the history of India, there was a 14-member high-level committee of officials deputed by the Election Commission (EC) to visit Hyderabad and find the complaints to be ‘genuine’, they said in the letter also marked to Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora.

The Congress reminded that their fear has some credence given the fact that since 2014 there were several instances of “fake degree certificate rackets” exposed by the police. As promised by the officials at the all-party meeting on October 3, they demanded a door-to-door verification by officials.

283,2020/10/08,Bidders seek extension of deadline for new secretariat,"Govt. rules out scope for mobilisation advance as a policy

The government has expedited steps to start constructing the new integrated secretariat complex with the pre-bid meeting of interested contracting firms getting under way on Wednesday.

The meeting was convened in line with the tender schedule issued in the last week of September. The pre-bid meeting will be followed by opening of technical bids on October 13 and price bids on October 16.

The meeting went on smoothly with some of the prospective bidders asking the government to extend the construction deadline from the existing 12 months to at least 18 months. Contractors also wanted the government to pay mobilisation advance so that they can commence the works at the earliest besides ensuring payments on a monthly basis without fail.

The government, according to sources, insisted that the project should be completed within one year, in line with the wish of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao.

Regarding mobilisation advance, the government ruled out scope for any such payments, but contractors were assured of timely payments every month. “We don’t give mobilisation advance to any project as a policy,” a senior Roads and Buildings official told The Hindu.

The pre-bid meeting was conducted after a delay of about 10 days as the total built up area of the proposed secretariat has been increased from 66,479.92 sq.m (7.15 lakh sq.ft) to 70,315.19 sq.m (7.56 lakh sq.ft). The main complex will be with 11 floors in addition to ground and lower ground floors (LG+G+11).

Though the number of floors in the main complex remained the same, the built up area has increased from 6.66 lakh sq.ft to 6.99 lakh sq.ft and this was mainly due to the staff amenities and other facilities.

285,2020/10/08,KCR for tough action against forest smugglers,"Police asked to coordinate with Forest officials to curb smuggling

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, on Wednesday, directed Home and Forest departments’ officials to take stern action against those plundering forest wealth.

“Timber smuggling has become an easy business for vested interests because of the negligent attitude of previous governments. The government has, however, taken a serious note of the malice since the formation of the separate State,” he said. Accordingly, the CM directed the civilian police to forge effective coordination with the Forest department to stop smuggling of forest wealth.

Mr. Rao was speaking at a high-level meeting of senior officials of Police and Forest departments here on Wednesday. He said that the State was ahead of all others in terms of maintenance of law and order situation and this could be achieved with the help of police officials at different levels. “There is a need for officials concerned to continue their good work for maintaining law and other situation in the State,” he said.

In this context, he added that police personnel should actively participate in the Telanganaku Harita Haram programme so that they could spread awareness about conservation of forest wealth among the general public which, in turn, would help in controlling smuggling. Forest department officials have been directed to coordinate with the police in this direction.

“Officials of the two departments should conduct coordination meetings and prepare an action plan to curb timber smuggling,” he said. He told the police to deal firmly with those indulging in preparation of fake certificates as reports on the existence of such rackets would send wrong signals. Officials should focus on nabbing the gangs indulging in producing fake certificates and stringent action should be initiated against those found guilty.

About policemen retiring from service, he said that there should not be any delays in making appointments on compassionate grounds. Every eligible member of the family of a deceased should be given jobs based on their qualifications and the department should prepare an action plan in this regard at the earliest.

The Chief Minister directed Director General of Police M. Mahender Reddy to find out whether there were any vacancies in other departments so that they could be filled by candidates in the waiting list. Recalling that the government was implementing 33% reservation for women, Mr. Rao said facilities for women employees should accordingly be created in all the police stations.

He exhorted the department to leverage advancements in technology to control crime.

Municipal Administration and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao has said that the Telangana government has assisted about 36,000 SC and ST youths in turning entrepreneurs through the T-Pride scheme with the belief that caste discrimination can be eradicated by financially empowering the communities.

At a meeting attended by SC Welfare Minister Koppula Eshwar and Tribal Welfare Minister Satyavathi Rathod here, Mr. Rama Rao reviewed schemes meant for both communities. SC and ST Commission chairman Errolla Srinivas and MLA Balka Suman were present.

During the meeting, Mr. Rama Rao also released ₹100 crore subsidy from the Industries department that will help 2,000 beneficiaries from the communities. The Ministers handed over the cheques to the beneficiaries.

The IT Minister instructed the officials to come up with the best policies to encourage SC and ST entrepreneurs, and asked them to study the schemes being implemented in various other States. He also asked the officials to take up awareness programmes in rural areas and educate the youth with State’s policies and schemes. After launching the SC, ST Commission website and inaugurating the renovated office, Mr. Rama Rao appreciated the commission for extending support in cases related to atrocities against the communities.

287,2020/10/08,Nearly 50 differently-abled patients at Gandhi recover,"Separate ward is provided to those with visual impairment

Around 50 COVID-19 patients with vision loss, hearing impairment or physical disabilities who underwent treatment at Gandhi Hospital have recovered.

One among them is a 45-year-old man who is speech and hearing-impaired; he was discharged a few days ago. A video of him expressing gratitude to doctors and staff in sign language was circulated by the hospital administration on Wednesday. The patient used to communicate with doctors and staff through text messages whatever he wanted to ask and showed it to them.

Hospital nodal officer for COVID-19, T. Prabhakar Reddy said the 45-year-old is not the first patient with impairment to have recovered from the infectious disease at the COVID-designated hospital in the city.

The visually-impaired patients are mostly provided bed near bathrooms. Ward boys or neighbouring patients used to assist them in measuring steps to the bathrooms. Officials said that patients who do not have any form of disability help out patients with disabilities.

A separate ward is assigned to patients who have vision impairment, or a speech or hearing disability. However, the hospital lacks bathrooms for people with such disabilities and is in urgent need of upgrading its facilities for the convenience of such patients.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/nearly-50-differently-abled-patients-at-gandhi-recover/article32797875.ece
288,2020/10/08,ECMO support revives woman with severe respiratory distress,"The costly procedure is used as last resort in case of critically-ill patients

A 58-year-old woman with severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), secondary to COVID-19, got a new lease of life with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) therapy provided by doctors at a corporate hospital.

ECMO, a costly procedure, is used as a last resort when other forms of heart and lung support do not work in support of critically ill-patients.

It is a method in which blood is drawn out of body and oxygen is mixed with blood using a special bypass pump-circuit and then pumped back into the body. The device works as artificial lungs.

Obesity, co-morbidities

The female patient, who is obese, was admitted in the ICU of the hospital on September 16. She had co-morbid illness in the form of diabetes. As the patient was not maintaining oxygen levels above 70% with high oxygen supports, doctors team decided to escalate to mechanical ventilator.

“Even on ventilator support, her oxygen levels were fluctuating between 80% and 90%. At this juncture, the team of doctors discussed with the family members and with their consent, ECMO treatment was initiated from September 19. With that, oxygenation improved,” informed a press release from the hospital.

Besides, her left lung had suddenly collapsed due to obstruction by a mucus plug and added bacterial infection. The team of doctors decided to do an urgent bronchoscopy and were able to clear off the mucus and re-opened the lungs. Following this, patient improved and removed from ECMO on September 28.

“She was discharged on October 5 on tracheotomy to a rehabilitation centre, where she will undergo rigorous physical training and will be shifted home,” said Dr. G.

290,2020/10/08,Bridge over troubled waters,"Bengaluru’s musicians hope to lift spirits with their upcoming online concert ‘This Too Shall Pass’ on October 11

Normalcy, like the horizon, seems to be an imaginary line that recedes when you approach it, at least in 2020. In a bid to encourage people everywhere to remain hopeful, a few of Bengaluru musicians decided to arrange an online concert.

Brain child of the city’s musicians, Avinash Grubb and Carlton Braganza, ‘This Too Shall Pass’ will feature classical sacred music as well as more contemporary fare.

“I love this kind of music and I grew up with classical music both at church and at home. There are not too many places where one can sing these pieces, so I was happy to get this initiative going,” says Carlton Braganza of OPUS and Jukebox Jammies fame.

“This kind of music is very close to my heart,” he says, adding that he would be performing, ‘Panis Angelicus’ and ‘The Lord’s Prayer,’ among other musical masterpieces.

Joining Avinash and Carlton are Sandra Oberoi, founder of Harmony Music School, and her daughters Tiara and Tiana.

“We are very excited to be a part of this event and we will be presenting a blend of sacred music as well as classical crossover music. We chose songs that would uplift the soul, especially in these trying times,” says Sandra Oberoi, who will be presenting a solo by Charles Gounod.

Other highlights of the concert include an Irish folk tune set to a three-part arrangement, Mozart, Bach and sacred arias presented by violinist Arun Rozario and vocalist Daniella Rebelo who will be accompanied by Avinash Grubb on the pipe organ and piano.

One of the city’s best known heritage landmarks, the 211-year-old St Mark’s Church is the venue for the concert which will be streamed on October 11 at 5pm on YouTube as well as on the St Mark's Church and OPUS Facebook pages.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/w10683/article32803829.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Image-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bridge-over-troubled-waters/article32803830.ece
291,2020/10/08,Bringing Ustad Amir Khan’s khayals alive,"Supriyo Dutta conveyed the essence of Ustad Amir Khan’s music in an online concert to celebrate Pt. Vijay Kichlu’s 90th birthday

To celebrate Pt. Vijay Kichlu’s 90th birthday, Sangeet Ashram, Kolkata, organised an online event. Kichlu, a renowned musician and musicologist, is the founder-director of Sangeet Research Academy. During his 25-year tenure at the academy, he trained several classical musicians of repute. After relinquishing the post in 2002, he founded Sangeet Ashram, an organisation that grooms listeners of classical music.

The event focused on Ustad Amir Khan – the path-breaking modernist and the founder of the Indore gharana.

The essence of his music was highlighted through a critical appreciation of some of his favourite compositions. Instead of playing Khansaheb’s popular records, the bandishes were rendered by Supriyo Dutta, a young and talented follower of Khansaheb.

Fine blend of styles

This was a daunting task, but the vocalist’s deft handling can be attributed to his training under Acharya Ramakrishna Basu (a disciple of Ustad Amir Khan), Pt. Vijay Kichlu and Subhra Guha. His rich voice conveyed a fine blend of the nuances of the Indore and Agra gharanas. He was brilliantly supported by Indranil Mullick (disciple of Pt. Swapan Chaudhuri) and Jyotirmoy Banerjee (disciple of Pt. Ajoy Chakrabarty).

Dutta commenced with ‘Baje niki ghunghariyan’ (Bilaskhani Todi). Despite the raga’s pathos-ridden character, Khansaheb would bring out the frivolous beauty of this composition with his taans; because this is apparently a love song. According to Sufi philosophy, the supreme being is an enchanting lover.

The next bandish, ‘Mana ke panchhi’ (Gurjari Todi) created an ambience of calm, a quality that defined Khansaheb’s music. Dutta next moved to a devotional bandish in raag Bairagi followed by a rare Khansaheb composition that features his pen name, ‘Sur rang’. Most of his compositions such as ‘Jinke mana raam biraje’ (Malkauns) do not carry this moniker and are sung by musicians across gharanas.

Despite being a traditionalist, Ustad Amir Khan did not hesitate to experiment. He incorporated minor changes in the lyrics of traditional bandish to suit his style and mood. To highlight this aspect, Dutta sang a Jog bandish, ‘Saajan more ghar aaye’. For the Agra gayaki’s bol-baant, the staccato-oriented ‘ata mana sukh paave’ suits best, but Khansaheb went on record with ‘jiyara at sukh pave’ because the word ‘jiyara’ suited his elaboration better. Apart from this sensitive approach to lyrics, he would interpret raags from a unique angle. One such example is raag Marwa. Traditionally an uttarang pradhan raag, Khansaheb’s persuasive style transformed it permanently into a poorvang-pradhan raag. He always mixed technique with emotion in such a way that a single raag could radiate different moods.

Interesting session

Dutta strived to showcase all these points while rendering slow and fast compositions in Marwa, Malkauns, Darbari, Miyan Malhar, Ramdasi Malhar, and Megh along with taranas. Khansaheb completely transformed taranas as he believed that ‘every syllable of a tarana is meaningful.’

The interesting session closed with a surprise item. Khansaheb sang only khayals on stage but as a playback singer in films, he had recorded a thumri and ghazal. The ghazal, Mirza Ghalib’s ‘Rahiye ab aisi jagah’, tuned by his prime disciple Pt. Amarnath, rendered at the concert made for a grand finale.

Since the event has been professionally videographed, the audio quality is appreciably good.

292,2020/10/08,"Remembering guru ma, Annapurna Devi","Annapurna Devi’s only purpose in life was to pass on her father Ustad Allauddin Khan’s taalim

Annapurna Devi shunned the limelight in her lifetime. Now, for her second death anniversary (October 13), her nephew Ustad Aashish Khan and his School of World Music have organised a programme to pay tribute to the reclusive genius.

To be held on October 11, the programme also celebrates the memory of Aashish’s late younger brother, Ustad Dhyanesh Khan, whose sarodist-son Shiraz Ali, is helping to put it together.

California-based Aashish Khan trained periodically under his aunt. “When my grandfather was away, pishima (Annapurna) was in charge of our teaching and practice. She was systematic and used to herself play on the tabla bayan to help us maintain the laya. She used to teach us vocal dhrupad compositions, horis, taranas as well as instrumental gats. Teaching was according to the season — raags like Basant, Paraj in spring and Malhars in monsoon. I was first taught aalap by her; also the ‘da ra da ra’ bols which are not authentic sarod baaj. We miss her a lot.”

Experience by hearing

One of Annapurna Devi’s finest disciples is Jodhpur-based sarodist, Pt. Basant Kabra, who belongs to a family of businessmen and classical music connoisseurs. The laconic musician paints a heart-warming picture of his guru.

“Guru ma was around 53 when I first went to learn from her. A surbahar exponent, she never played the instrument when teaching us. Maybe once or twice she picked up the instrument to demonstrate something that I couldn’t understand. Ma taught me a little surbahar baaj (technique) too, and the correct hold of the sitar. Her priority in life was to pass on the taalim she had imbibed from her father.”

Annapurna Devi was particular about what type of music should be played on which instrument. Tayyari ke taan, zamzama, bol kaari are meant for sitar while aalap and gamak are meant for surbahar.

“Ma used to always say, ‘Concentrate on what I am teaching you about a raag and note its usage, don’t go into technicalities. And don’t try explaining its structure to others; our gharana’s raags are handled differently. One can only experience them by hearing. You can’t verbalise what I teach you to play; it can only be conveyed through your music,” recalls Basant.

One of her favourite raags was Manjh Khamaj, created by her legendary father, Ustad Allaudin Khan. “She would say the raag helps beat tiredness, but one hears it only in its lighter form now, as something to end a concert with. . She taught it fully only to a few disciples. She once told me she herself had not mastered how to play the raag the way her Baba had conceived it,” says Basant.

Annapurna Devi also loved raags that are ‘madhyam pradhan’. Her father, in fact, created raag Kausi Bhairav for her. “She explained to me how this raag is similar to Adana and Darbari. And that raags Kausi Kanhra and Kausi Bhairav are not the same. She also told me that Ustad Allauddin Khan taught raag Darbari only to three of his disciples — Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan and her.

A demanding guru

“My guru was very difficult to learn from; she would remember exactly what she had taught five years ago. She didn’t ever want to be recorded. Or even photographed; there is just one photo of hers in recent years. But I know she was recorded; because she wrote down what she recorded in a notebook that she wrote in Bangla. (This has been translated into English by Swapan Kumar Bondyopadhyay in The Unheard Melody.). These recordings were done in the 1940s. She recorded Ragas Puriya and Gara, which I have never heard.”

Recalling her sharp ear, Basant says she would call out from the kitchen when cooking to check the ‘pancham tarab’. “Imagine, not even a note on the main wire but on the sympathetic wire. She was an amazing person, not just a fantastic musician. She never criticised other musicians. My last memory of her is on Guru Purnima, before she passed away. She asked me to sit by her bed and play raag Yaman. Despite knowing her so well, I never understood many things about her — why she never created raags and why she was so reclusive,” says Basant, as his voice peters off and he gets lost in memories.

293,2020/10/08,What enhances the aural appeal: words or music?,"The lyrics in a composition can sometimes make it a transcendental experience

When my spouse began playing Sanjay Subrahmanyan’s rendition of ‘Thunbam Nergayil’ for what seemed the 100th time that day, I sat up and took notice. I wanted to understand why he was so entranced with it. “Didn’t you listen to the words?” he asked . His somewhat cryptic response set me thinking.

I’ve always believed that music transcends boundaries—of culture, language and religion. Which is why Pavarotti singing Verdi’s Rigoletto moved me despite my utter ignorance of the Italian language. Any of us who’ve been to films would have experienced our eyes tearing up when a somnolent violin accompanies the heroine’s break-up. Even a lone instrument playing with nary a beat is enough to set our feelings atwitter.

When such music is set to even a simple rhythmic beat, it can trigger emotions. It is the beat in a Tamil or Hindi song that makes people dance, even if they don’t understand the lyrics. When I began learning Carnatic music as a child, rarely did my teachers stop to explain the meanings for either Tyagaraja’s Telugu songs or Purandaradasa’s Kannada songs. Even the Tamil songs were often in flowery and formal language and not in the simple vernacular spoken at home. It was, however, the ragas — a Sahana or a Simhendramadhyamam — that held me rapt.

My teacher, the late Seetalakshmi Venkatesan, introduced me to the vachanas of the Kannada mystics Akka Mahadevi and Basavanna. As a Tamil speaker, understanding the vachanas was not easy, but over time as I began to understand these works, it began reflecting in the joy I experienced while singing or teaching them. My husband’s epiphany with Bharatidasan’s ‘Thunbam Nergayil’ brought me back to considering what role lyrics play in enriching the listening experience of Indian music.

Role of lyrics

Folk music pre-dates all classical forms and it’s interesting to look at the role lyrics play there. With their refrains, many folk songs encourage us to sing along, helping foster a sense of community and forget the realities of everyday life. The poignant ‘Mee Dolkar’, a Marathi song of the Koli fishing community, compares the sea to a lover waiting impatiently for her partner. The quirky ‘Sasural Genda Phool’ from Chhattisgarh describes a new bride adjusting to her various in-laws.

While folk songs mirror the daily lives of people, ghazals often dwell on memories. The famous ‘Chupke Chupke Raat Din’ written by Maulana Hasrat Mohani and popularised by Ghulam Ali describes a love affair, the heartache of missing a beloved, and the encounter between the lovers. The words tug at one’s heartstrings and Ali’s sensitive rendition adds to the allure.

Tyagaraja wrote his songs in emotive and accessible Telugu, mostly in first person. His songs reflect his state of mind whether it is grief (‘Endhudhaaginaado’), yearning (‘Tera tiyaga radha’) or joy (‘Intha Kannananda’). And his vast repertoire has diverse lyrical content and context—from simple songs to the complex Pancharatna kritis. In Hindustani music, the lyrics or bandish are looked at primarily from the lens of improvisation of melody and rhythm. The lines, usually two to eight, are paeans to gods and royal patrons or describe emotions or nature. The popular ‘Aeri Aali Piya Bina’ reflects a lovelorn woman’s state of mind while ‘Tu Hain Malik Mera’ is a call to the divine.

More laidback

While classical music is bound by rules of grammar, the lyricists for films have greater laissez faire. When ‘Kolaveri Di’ became a hit, it took many by surprise, but predictably, it revived the widely-held notion that lyrics were being short-changed by an excessive focus on melody and rhythm.

Yet, without lyrics how do instrumentalists recreate a similar magic? Words, their power to move notwithstanding, can sometimes get in the way of our own imagination — as we’ve seen with many films, poorly adapted from books. Listening to instrumental music, however, gives the listener the freedom to imagine the lyrics on a blank slate.

But, as my husband discovered, the power of lyrics is indeed transcendental. Bharatidasan wrote ‘Thunbam Nergayil’, a poem about how the travails of our lives can be lessened by Tamil poetry, song, dance and wisdom. The lyric was set to tune in ragam Desh by the poet’s friend Dandapani Desigar, enhancing the charm of the work. And Sanjay Subrahmanyam’s emotive rendition brought these lyrics to life in a manner that reinforced the magic of the words.

294,2020/10/08,Don’t make music for the numbers: Benny Dayal,"The singer’s new single ‘Besura’ hits out at social media deciding the fate of a song

‘Besura gaata hoon, main bhi singer hoon, aise gaane aajkal zyada views laata hain, jitna besura hain utna natural hain, label wale bolte feel bhi zyada hain… (I sing out of tune, I am also a singer, such songs get more views these days, more discordant you sound, more natural it is, [music] label guys say it has more feel).’

That’s Benny Dayal at his sarcastic best. The lines are from his latest Hindi single, ‘Besura’, which he says “is my heart on the plate I eat these days”.

Benny has written, composed and sung the track, which is the first song of his EP, SHOSHAL MEDIA MUSIC. “‘Besura’ talks about my frustration as to how musicians feel after learning and training in classical music for so many years and yet don’t receive any recognition for their hard work sincerity and diligence”, explains Benny in the video.

He caught up with MetroPlus over a Zoom chat from his home in New Jersey, in the US. Excerpts:

Trigger behind ‘Besura’

I was disheartened by the approach of certain people to music. We learn music to become good musicians and it is a sublime feeling when people appreciate you. Fame is all that matters for many youngsters. Their aim is to make videos, post them on social media and get likes, views, followers and subscriptions. I get videos on my social media pages asking for feedback. There are some good artistes and I tell them to keep working hard. But there are quite a few who have no clue about what they are doing and, incidentally, their videos have more views than those who deserve the appreciation.

Writing the song

Words just flowed! I reached the US from Mumbai in August. One day, while checking messages on my Instagram page, I was taken aback by the quality of some of the videos. I couldn’t wait to put down my bottled-up thoughts. Once I figured out the chords on my ukulele and finalised the track, I sent it across to fellow musician Raajeev V Bhalla in Mumbai. He was excited about ‘Besura’ and even pointed that there were no grammatical errors in my lyrics! He came on board with his banjo and bass guitar. My portions in the video were shot in a park near our home by my wife [Catherine Dayal].

Response from the industry

They were happy and was like, ‘Truth had to be told’. The song is not meant to hurt anybody or to create a feud. My point is that if you are putting up a video, do it properly! Nobody is perfect. But practise holds the key. That brings finesse to your song. Don’t make music for the numbers. In fact, ‘Besura’ itself hasn’t garnered a lot of views. But I am happy that I did it.

On the EP, SHOSHAL MEDIA MUSIC

There are four songs and I have written three of them. All of them are in the same flavour. I deliberately named it SHOSHAL because that’s how some people pronounce the world ‘social’! (laughs).

Music today

Not many composers are using harmonies. Earlier, musicians would suggest including them to add layers to a composition. Now the focus is on the higher and lower octaves. That has become the trend and I don’t know where this is heading to.

Beating lockdown blues

I can’t wait to get on the stage. Since that’s not happening soon, I am channelising all my energy into making songs, videos and recording tracks at home. Lockdown was a much-needed time for all artistes to make their own music. I have been doing that since 2009-10, playing with indie bands and writing songs. Musicians the world over are doing that, thus becoming the face of their works. I recommend fellow artistes to create their own productions, even as they do film songs. In India, films are the reason why many of them want to become musicians.

Looking ahead

Film songs will always be there. Alongside I look forward to explore new aspects of music and try something different. But the main thing is I want to keep my work appealing. I don’t want to be a cerebral musician or make music that people don’t understand.

Being stereotyped

People might say that. But I don’t think so. I prefer to do whatever song that comes my way. And if I feel that I haven’t done a song in a particular genre, I will make one and put it out there, thus getting it out of my system.

Current projects

Shakuntala Devi has been the latest Hindi release. Many exciting projects are yet to be released. During the lockdown, I sang ‘Jee Le’, a composition by Raajeev. The video featured musicians Vishal Dadlani, Salim Merchant, Armaan Malik, Jonita Gandhi, Sidharth Mahadevan and the like.

Finally… thoughts on SPB [SP Balasubrahmanyam]

He has been an inspiration. I sang my first song, ‘Ballelakka’ [from Sivaji] with him. My voice is in the chorus. I shared this with him on the sets of Super Singer on Vijay TV. It was a memorable moment and I clicked a picture with him. I was touched when he took my hand and placed it in his for the camera. He used to say, ‘I know I am a good singer but I am not such a great singer’. That is the sign of his greatness.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/s3v6o3/article32802917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvmbenny11,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/benny-dayal-on-his-new-single-besura/article32802918.ece

The calls, Mr. Joy alleged, was by those who he had named in a previous petition in connection with an incident in which his mini lorry was set on fire around one-and-a-half months ago and against whom Mr. Rupesh didn’t take any action.

“When I turned up to lodge the petition, the sub inspector kicked me and my 14-year-old daughter also got kicked in the abdomen when she along with my wife tried to cover me. We are now undergoing treatment at a hospital at Manjumal,” he alleged.

Mr. Rupesh, however, shot down these allegations and instead accused Mr. Joy of verbally abusing him under the influence of alcohol and even trying to assault him when attempts were made to arrest him. He said that the petitioner was a known troublemaker and wanted the police to take action against those he had named in connection with the incident involving the vehicle though there was no evidence to back up those allegations. Mr. Rupesh attributed the protest against him by DYFI to his resistance to cede to political pressures.

DYFI has lodged a petition against the sub inspector to the State Women’s Commission, the State Commission for the Protection of Child Rights and the Police Complaints Authority seeking his suspension from service pending inquiry.

“We have had lodged similar petitions against his high-handedness with his superior authorities in the past,” said P.J. Paulson, secretary, DYI Ernakulam block committee.

‘Baseless allegations’

Cheranalloor Station House Officer N.R. Jose said that the petitioner’s allegation of assault was baseless and that in fact, he had blocked the exit of the sub inspector and verbally abused him under the influence of alcohol. “At that point, we attempted to arrest him, which he resisted with the help of two of his aides. Since women police were not present, we let him go as his family was also there.

His daughter wasn't assaulted as alleged but she fell down probably on being petrified after witnessing the mele,” he said.

Meanwhile, the police have registered a case against the petitioner and his acquaintances.

301,2020/10/08,KMRL to set up more solar power systems,"Agency plans to attain 60% energy neutrality; completes installation of panels at Thykoodam station

Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) is adding 5.4 MWp (mega watt peak, a solar power measure in photo-voltaic industry) of solar systems on its buildings and tracks this year to increase the solar power output to 1.57 crore units per year and also to attain 60% energy neutrality.

This is in addition to the three large-scale solar power generation systems commissioned by it in the past two years.

A communication from KMRL said that the first phase of the project, with 2.67 MWp capacity and capable of generating 36.5 lakh units per year, was implemented through RESCO (Renewable Energy Service Company) in 2018. This contributed to 60% of the total energy consumed at that point in time. But it was reduced to 30% with the opening of the new stations along the Maharaja’s-Thykoodam stretch.

“We are pushing for maximising the solar energy generation. We have a Solar Energy Policy in place and are installing solar plants in all our areas, as far as possible, to gain green and clean power. The same will be replicated in the Water Metro project also,” said KMRL MD Alkesh Kumar Sharma.

The agency has completed installation of solar panels at Thykoodam metro station and work is under way at Vyttila, Petta, South, Kadavanthra and Elamkulam.

There are also plans to install solar panels at JLN Stadium metro station’s rooftop of the corporate office, and track and ramp area at Muttom depot.

The installation of rooftop solar panels will be completed by mid-November and the remaining work by December. This initiative had brought down carbon emissions by 13,302 tonnes a year, which was equal to planting 5,33,033 trees, the agency claimed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/813h7v/article32798118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Edappally-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kmrl-to-set-up-more-solar-power-systems/article32798119.ece
302,2020/10/08,"City corporation’s land, where its new building being built, attached","Case over ‘inadequate compensation’ paid to Kochi Palace in 1989

In a major setback to the Kochi Corporation, the nearly 1.50 acres near the High Court on which its new sprawling headquarters is being built, was attached on Wednesday. The move was in the wake of an order by the Additional Court Ernakulam against an execution petition filed by the Palace Administration Board of the Kochi Palace from which the civic body had acquired the land in 1989. The order was issued on September 28.

The attachment was an outcome of the long-running litigation dating back to the 90s over the compensation paid for the land at the time of the acquisition. “A division bench of the High Court had ordered the corporation in 2011 to pay a compensation of ₹1.85 lakh per are since the original compensation of around ₹66,000 per are was found inadequate. However, the corporation neither did pay the compensation nor diligently presented its case in the court even thereafter,” said V.K. Prasad, the lawyer representing the Palace Administration Board. Mayor Soumini Jain said that the corporation was not the requisition agency and that the government had acquired the land. “We will, however, study the case in detail and take appropriate decision when the case comes up next on October 14,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/sxv9m1/article32798110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PHOTO-2020-10-07-17-55-43,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/city-corporations-land-where-its-new-building-being-built-attached/article32798114.ece
303,2020/10/08,"Coronavirus | Clamour for dedicated FLTCs for policemen, accused gets louder","Detenus testing positive exploit scant security at existing facility

There is a shrill call by the police for dedicated first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) both for police personnel and the accused testing positive for SARS-COV-2 as their numbers keep rising.

With over 60 active positive cases in the city police and 21 in the rural police, not to mention nearly 200 cops in quarantine after having come into contact with the infected, the Kerala Police Association (KPA) has raised such a demand with District Police Chiefs and the District Collector.

“We have identified a private hostel near the Kaloor stadium as a potential FLTC for infected cops from the city limits and the recommendation has been forwarded to the Collector. The Collector has to declare it as the FLTC for it to get the service of doctor and paramedical staff and, other facilities,” said N.V. Nishad, district secretary (Kochi City), KPA.

As of now, the majority of the infected cops are isolating themselves in their homes and only those who cannot afford it are undergoing treatment at FLTCs opened by various local bodies. The police had opened dedicated quarantine centres for their personnel when the case loaded started surging months ago but even that had attracted complaints about inadequate facilities.

Twin problems

The increasing instances of the accused testing positive and even jumping custody exploiting the scant security and surveillance at the FLTC being run at the convention centre of the Kochi airport where they are now being put up along with the infected from the general public has led to the demand for a separate facility for the accused as well. “It creates twin issues of putting cops in danger of getting infected by the accused as they either have to intervene to thwart escape bids or recapture the accused besides facing the prospects of suspension in the event the accused managing to flee,” said M.V. Sanil, district secretary (Ernakulam Rural), KPA. Two cops remain under suspension after Suresh aka ‘Dracula’ Suresh, a serial robber, jumped custody multiple times.

The police have tentatively identified a portion of a COVID centre being run at NUALS at Kalamasserry as a potential facility for keeping the infected accused from both the city and rural limits. “There is a compound wall enabling adequate security of the accused unlike the FLTC at the Kochi airport with multiple exits and entry points, and where the police are dependent on health workers to monitor the accused,” said Mr. Nishad.

Though the police have not openly raised it, there is a sentiment among large sections of the force to scale down their role in quarantine checking and contact tracing now that the numbers are too high for such a system to be practical and cops are also getting infected at a rapid rate, affecting their routine policing duties.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/oobt7c/article32798099.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08KI-POLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/clamour-for-dedicated-fltcs-for-policemen-accused-gets-louder/article32798100.ece
304,2020/10/08,Koodiyattam’s dramatic transition,"The ancient theatre form’s online experiments are bringing in more viewers but also throwing up new challenges

From the koothambalam to the device screen, it has not been an easy transition for Koodiyattam, Kerala’s ancient Sanskrit theatre form, to adapt itself to the new normal. Besides its elaborate costume and heavy make-up, the art form is known for its lengthy scenes, an entire play may be staged in over 100 days and a single act in seven to 12 days with a performance duration of three to six hours.

Traditionally performed as part of rituals in temples and later, on stage, Koodiyattam artistes, faced with an uncertain future in the wake of the pandemic, have been exploring the online world to reach out to the audience. And they have met with a fair amount of success.

Initial attempts, mainly through Facebook, in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown were born more out of enthusiasm than certainty. But as the lockdown was extended, both artistes and cultural organisers stepped up their act with a stream of webinars, lec-dems and pre-recorded programmes.

The live streaming that followed had the biggest impact, with both Koodiyattam and Kathakali, which draws a relatively larger audience, seeing a spike in views. Nepathya Moozhikkulam and Madhavamathrugramam, two popular Koodiyattam groups, say the feedback has been extremely encouraging.

Nepathya was perhaps the first off the blocks has presented 12 live Koodiyattam and Nangiarkoothu performances and ten Chakyarkoothu sessions since May. According to its creative director, Margi Madhu, “I am happy about the increasing viewership online. Our monthly programmes used to get only a small audience, but on Facebook it is being watched by an average of 40 people. The videos of these performances, streamed later, have been garnering over 3,000 views. I believe our English subtitles have helped extend our reach outside India.”

Technical glitches

Madhu, however, also has some concerns. Though the quality of the video is good, he is not happy with the audio quality, especially of the mizhavu drums. Improving the standard of live streaming calls for a fine set of equipment, including video camera, microphone with audio mixing device, video switcher and encoder.

“But that would require huge investment, which is difficult in the present circumstances when the focus is to help artistes monetarily due to cancellation of events and festivals,” says Madhu.

Koodiyattam artiste Rajaneesh Chakyar of Madhavamathrugramam has attempted only Chakyarkoothu online till now. “Initially, we decided to wait it out. But as the lockdown was extended, we decided to try out the new medium. We converted a room in our house into a studio, put black backdrops, fitted LED lights, and used our mobile cameras to shoot. We know the quality isn’t ideal, so we have planned to invest in better equipment.”

Despite the challenges, it is the positive feedback that has kept Rajaneesh going during this crisis. “For one, we get a larger audience as people sit at home and watch. Also, the video remains on the Facebook page, so anyone can go back and watch it.” Sound is an issue for Rajaneesh too. “We tried collar mic for Koothu, a speech-intensive art form, but it gets cut off intermittently when we move about on stage.”

The scene is a little different in Kathakali. Here it is usually the organiser who arranges the venue. The last one month has seen an increase in live programmes, organised by various groups, but the streaming quality has not been consistent.

The right ambience

Shaji Mullookkaaran, an IT professional with a keen interest in art videography, says this is an opportunity to get the latest technology. Shaji confronts many problems in his work, from bright, overpowering backdrops to unsuitable lighting and inadequate bandwidth. He says that organisers must pay more attention to these factors rather than leaving everything to the lighting contractor.

“They must insist on a clean black background, PAR lights that can focus a narrow beam and control brightness. They should also ensure high-speed fibre broadband. Going forward, all venues must ideally provide fibre connection. All these will add to the cost but will result in a good viewing experience,” explains Shaji. He feels that online presentations are here to stay as more people have begun to enjoy watching programmes from the comfort of their homes.

Madhu agrees. He plans to continue streaming even after Covid. “But first we need to upgrade our equipment and sponsors can help us do it,” he says.

It is time art lovers, corporate entities and the government came together to take Koodiyattam, the 2,000-year-old Sanskrit theatre recognised by UNESCO as one of the ‘Masterpieces of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity’, and Kathakali, an art form synonymous with Kerala, to the next level.

305,2020/10/08,Will theatre go back to the open?,"As Agnipankh is televised, Mita Vashisht reflects on the shifts in theatre due to the pandemic

Under the spotlight, the silhouette of a woman becomes visible. Clad in a silk saree, she is seated on a high armchair, one foot tucked under her, and the other on the footstool. The inner precincts of a lavish haveli come to life as she peers thoughtfully into an array of files, adjusting her spectacles and holding a quill. Actor Mita Vashisht plays the matriarch of a zamindar family in Maharashtra in a play set in 1948. Agnipankh, the Hindi adaptation of PL Mayekar’s epic Marathi play from the 1980s, has been revived in this teleplay version.

“The play is relevant for all times,” says Mita, “It talks about people, their strengths and vulnerabilities, and for standing up for what they believe is right.” The play revolves around the character of Durgeshwari, known as ‘Baisaab’, who runs the zamindari estate with astute authority while her husband (played by Satyajit Sharma), unable to manage the business with his scholarly and artistic interests, has succumbed to alcoholism and debauchery.

“It is one of the rare dramas from that era where the woman is at the centre. She came into the family as a young wife, cleverly brought in because of her intelligence in handling the fortunes of the estate, and even though she is a woman, she upholds the system’s patriarchy. She is also child-like since she hasn’t known any other man, and shares this love-hate relationship with her husband,” points out Mita, who has played the role of a strong woman many times before.

For the actor, it was important to find her unique voice as Baisaab. “I took a long time figuring out how Baisaab would speak. The spoken word is often overlooked by actors. Working with the word is not just communicating the dialogues, but how you release the word, the pauses, the breath.”

Stage to screen

Mita has worked across different genres and medium — stage, cinema and television. The power of the teleplay lies in its simple stage aesthetics that do not alter the camera’s dramatic flow. After numerous live shows since 2017, the play was adapted for the OTT platform. “The set design, lighting and scenography remain unchanged. Initially, I was sceptical about televising it, but we were not overwhelmed by the camera. It was important to stay faithful to the format of the play and the energy of theatre as it is performed.”

Mita disagrees that technology is key to presenting plays today. She feels it is important to return to simple aesthetics of stagecraft and layered performances. “Is digital theatre really theatre? I feel that in the coming years, technology will take a backseat and the performers will come to the fore.”

Reflecting on the shifts in the theatre form because of the pandemic, the actor says, “Will we get to do theatre again? Maybe in the lawn, maybe we will sit on blankets, apart from each other and watch. I feel, in a strange way, that the present challenge is taking theatre back to where it came from. Theatre architecture was designed for being near nature. Maybe it is time again to return to a theatre in the open, instead of pushing it behind closed doors.”

During the lockdown, Mita got into an introspective mode and tried to make peace with the uncertainty. “I want to ask the artiste community – even when things were normal did one always have work? I think it’s important to respect and be humble about this uncertainty. We think we are in control of our life but it’s not so. This is a chance to reflect upon this, to be free from fear and think of new ways of being.”

306,2020/10/08,West Bengal closes Secretariat on day of BJP march,"People of the State are going to send Didi on leave soon, say party leaders

The West Bengal government on Wednesday announced that ‘Nabanna’, the Secretariat, will be closed for sanitisation on Thursday and Friday. The announcement assumes significance as the BJP has announced a “March to Nabanna” on Thursday.

“As per a decision taken long back and as per standard practices, I am directed to convey that Nabanna and Writers’ Building will be closed for deep cleaning and sanitisation on Thursday and Friday,” a notification said, adding, “All officers and employees are requested to stay away from these premises, keeping in mind health & safety protocols, on these two days.”

The BJP had planned four massive rallies to the Secretariat located on the other bank of the Hooghly river in the Howrah town. The leadership took note of the development. Its national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has declared the two-day holiday during its “March to Nabanna”.

“In the near future people of the State are going to send Didi [Mamata Banerjee] on a leave,” Mr. Vijayvargiya said. The BJP called the march to highlight “deteriorating law and order”.

The spat between Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and the Home department continued for the second consecutive day. In a detailed statement shared on social media, the department said, “No government functionary should authoritatively and publicly quote any crime data unless those are verified by the National Crime Records Bureau.” The Governor had on Tuesday quoted figures of rape and kidnappings recorded in August 2020. The Home department had called it misleading.

Mr. Dhankhar responded by saying the department was trying a “cover up”.

“Oh My God. They surely know what they are engaged in! What a cover up! So Divisional Commissioners under their signatures with signed inputs from respective district Magistrates and sent to the constitutional head were not ‘authentic’. Am flabbergasted. No sane takers for this,” the Governor tweeted. He also wrote to the Chief Minister saying he received the data from the Divisional Commissioners.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/prp8iu/article32798452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIJAYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/west-bengal-closes-secretariat-on-day-of-bjp-march/article32798453.ece

The protesters were released late in the evening. The agitating farmers announced to resume their sit-in close to Mr. Chautala’s residence.

“Finally, after 10 hours, everyone was released unconditionally. Farmers to resume their dharna. A small step for farmer activists, a big leap for farmers’ movement. Congratulations!,” said Swaraj India’s national president Yogendra Yadav, who was also detained.

Sirsa DSP Aryan Chaudhary confirmed that the protesters have been released.

Earlier, Sirsa SP Bhupender Singh said, “We had detained around 70 people who were squatting on a road since Tuesday night, close to Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala’s residence, causing inconvenience to the public. Most farmers had left after yesterday’s protest. We are investigating if any ‘anti-social’ elements are among the group.”

The indefinite strike launched by the youth wing of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti (KVVES) in front of the Kozhikode civil station was called off on the first day itself following an assurance from District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao that genuine issues related to traders’ operations in containment zones would be resolved.

The youth wing of the merchant’s association resorted to the hunger stir alleging that revenue and police officials were forcibly closing shops in containment zones without giving any logical explanation. They also accused officials of taking unilateral decisions.

KVVES State president T. Nazeerudheen,who opened the protest, alleged that the ‘unscientific classification’ of containment zones without discussing any safety arrangement with traders was troubling thousands of hapless traders who had been struggling to overcome financial blues.

Youth wing leaders who took part in the strike said the alleged flaws in the declaration of containment zones were badly affecting the lives of many daily wage workers.

The issues were also placed before the District Collector during a conciliation talk in the evening.

310,2020/10/08,Jal Jeevan to cover all panchayats in Kunnamangalam constituency,"Remote areas of Olavanna to get domestic water connections

The Jal Jeevan rural water supply project for the State launched by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday will cover all the grama panchayats of Kunnamangalam assembly constituency in Kozhikode district. Administrative sanction has already been given to shortlisted projects worth ₹55 crore for implementation in the first phase itself.

The highest amount of ₹21 crore will be spent for providing 8,400 domestic water supply connections in the remote areas of Olavanna panchayat. The second highest allocation of ₹14 crore is for Peruvayal panchayat, where 4,000 connections will be given. Kunnamangalam, Chathamangalam, Mavoor and Perumanna are the other panchayats that will directly benefit from the project.

At the constituency-level launch of the scheme on Thursday, officials said the project to be implemented with the Central government support would provide 22, 955 new water connections. It would give higher priority to backward communities and settlements, and would be implemented by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) and the Kerala Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (Jalanidhi), they said.

According to project coordinators, the mission-mode project would strive to improve rural water supply schemes by facilitating 21.42 lakh new domestic connections across the State in the first phase itself. It would reach out to 716 panchayats in Kerala in such a way to cover all the shortlisted beneficiaries by 2024, they said.

KIIFB fund

The strengthening of some of the existing water supply schemes, and the development of potable water sources in rural areas too would be part of the Jal Jeevan Mission. To support it, some of such projects would be completed under the development schemes of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). Koyilandy drinking water project would be one of such major schemes to be completed using the KIIFB fund.

KWA officials said there would be separate panchayat-level and State-level committees for the thorough monitoring of the project implementation. For the public, project details and its execution status would be made available on a portal for review, they said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/jal-jeevan-to-cover-all-panchayats-in-kunnamangalam-constituency/article32804057.ece
311,2020/10/08,Parties gear up for local body polls,"LDF, UDF launch efforts to cobble together poll alliances

Mainstream political parties have started getting down to business for the upcoming three-tier local bodies polls even as the State Election Commission is yet to notify the dates for the elections.

The parties have set in motion the process of the seat-sharing at the grassroots level with the procedures for the draw of lots for selecting the reservation wards in the district panchayats, block panchayats, grama panchayats, municipalities and corporations being completed. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the electorate will witness political parties sounding the poll bugle in a reconstructed format of digital mode electioneering.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front will officially begin the seat-sharing exercise at the State level on Saturday while the Congress-led United Democratic Front will scrutinise the reports of the sub committees at the panchayats from Thursday.

This time, the CPI(M) will have to make efforts to accommodate the new coalition partners, the Indian National League (INL) and Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), which are eyeing for more seats.

In the previous polls held in 2015, the erstwhile Janata Dal (United) when it was with the UDF, had emerged victorious in 65 grama panchayat wards, 13 in block panchayats, four in district panchayats, 12 in municipalities and three in corporations in the State. Then the INL had a tactical understanding with the LDF in most local bodies.

Further, the CPI(M) will have to spare some seats to the Kerala Congress (M) if it finally decides to align with the Left parties, thus beginning a new electoral relationship for the Assembly polls next year.

Party sources said the Congress-led coalition would hold State-level talks by October 15. Already, leaders of the Congress and the IUML held bi-lateral talks to capture some civic bodies such as Kozhikode Corporation where the combine has been struggling for a long time to dethrone the Left coalition.

314,2020/10/08,‘Have an eye check-up once a year’,"Diabetes can affect several parts of the body, including the retina of the eye. If diabetic retinopathy is identified at an earlier stage, it can be easily treated either through a laser surgery or an injection, said V.R. Saravanan, Medical Consultant, Retina and Vitreous Services of Aravind Eye Hospital.

Speaking at a webinar organised by Aravind Eye Care System on the occasion of World Sight Day here on Thursday, he said that if diabetic retinopathy was identified at a later stage, the patient might have to undergo a surgery. “So it is important that people undergo an eye check-up once a year, even if there are no symptoms,” he said.

“Glaucoma, which is usually asymptomatic, is a silent stealer of vision,” said R. Ramakrishnan, Senior Medical Consultant at Aravind Eye Hospital, Tirunelveli. Early detection of glaucoma was important to avoid vision loss, he said.

V. Raghuram Venkatesan of the hospital said a nutrient-rich food of vegetables and fruits was essential for the eyes. Karthik Srinivasan, Retina Consultant, spoke on measures to be taken to protect eyes during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was better to avoid using contact lenses during the pandemic. It was advisable not to share make-up products and eyes must be wash every day, he said.

315,2020/10/08,Empty rooms stare in the face of hotel owners,"Despite relaxation of lockdown norms, visitors just keep away

Madurai

Relaxation of COVID-19 lockdown norms notwithstanding, the occupancy rate in most of the hotels in Madurai is only around 20%. The large number of unsold rooms is causing consternation among the hoteliers who have borrowed heavily to keep their establishments running.

Madurai Hotel and Lodge Owners Association president K.P. Navaneetha Krishnan says the occupancy ratio at most hotels and lodges, irrespective of their size, is only around 15% to 20%. “Though some hotels have reduced their room tariff by half, the customer footfall has hardly increased,” he says.

S. Senthil Nathan, Director (Operations), Hotel Germanus, says many of the business conferences and meetings that used to regularly take place at the hotels, are now being conducted as webinars due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Many businesses have not shown interest in booking halls or rooms for the next few months,” he says.

Currently, only those who travel by their own vehicles from other places stay at hotels and lodges, and only when it’s absolutely necessary, says Mr. Krishnan. “The tourist inflow has also not picked up as people are scared about their safety in these COVID-19 times. Many customers keep enquiring about the safety precautions that we follow in hotels,” he says.

Wallets are light

Since the pandemic has also financially affected people from all walks of life, they have very little disposable income. So, spending their leisure time at hotels will be their last priority,” says Mr. Senthil Nathan. The income is meagre, but the hotels and lodges have electricity bills and other bills to pay, and salary for their staff. “Regular disinfection of the hotel and taking up other safety precautions due to the pandemic has added to the expenditure,” he says.

The lower footfall has financially affected all hotels and lodges, says A. Ramasubbu, proprietor of Sai Ram Residency. “Those who have borrowed heavily from banks are suffering the most as they find it hard to repay the installments,” he says.

G. Vasudevan, vice-president, Tamil Nadu Travel Mart Society, and Director of Fortune Pandiyan Hotel, says usually hotels have a occupancy ratio of 70% during this period of the year. “It will take more months for businesses to return to normality. But it is important that people follow safety precautions by wearing face masks, frequently washing hands and maintaining personal distance in public places,” he says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/i5zv2l/article32806576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09MACITY-HOTEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/empty-rooms-stare-in-the-face-of-hotel-owners/article32806577.ece

317,2020/10/08,Need to promote Sivakasi fireworks,"MP, officials and manufacturers discuss the issue

Virudhunagar MP B. Manickam Tagore has initiated a discussion to bring an export hub in Sivakasi for its fireworks goods taking a cue from Centre’s proposal to transform each district into an export hub.

He held a discussion with representatives of the fireworks industry and Petroleum and Explosives Safety officials here on Thursday.

“China has cornered the entire export of fireworks industry across the globe though Sivakasi has a huge potential for export of its products,” he said.

Stating that the Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, had said that export hub should be created in each district to export its special products, he said that Sivakasi fireworks should be exported to harness its potential and further develop the industry in the interest of the manufacturers and workers.

“Now that Chinese crackers are facing opposition world-wide, we should explore how to capitalize on the situation and promote Sivakasi fireworks,” he added.

Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives R. Sundaresan said that the bottleneck in exporting fireworks would be discussed threadbare in the coming days to export Indian fireworks.

Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers’ Association president Ganesan Panjurajan said that at present India’s export was only around 0.5% of ₹ 50,000-crore export market.

“Shipping has been the major handicap for exporting fireworks. Not all shipping liners accept fireworks for transport and freight charges are almost equal to the production cost. If this issue is redressed, Sivakasi can export its products to many countries,” he added.

SFI district secretary S. Veldeva said the government first announced that students could come to school to clarify doubts on the subject, but with their parents’ consent. The decision was later cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic not subsiding.

A. Bonyface, a member of Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), said the students did not wear school uniform. They had classes for four hours and did not wear face masks inside the classroom, he said.

Mr. Veldeva said action must be taken against all private institutions that ask students to come to the school during the pandemic.

Chief Educational Officer R. Swaminathan said that when he enquired with the school, they said a small number of students had come to the school to clarify doubts. “But the management asked the students to leave home by noon.

325,2020/10/08,Kumari Isaiyarvui Abubucker no more,"Noted singer Abubucker, popularly known as Kumari Isaiyaruvi Abubucker, passed away at Hasthinapuram in Chennai on Thursday. He was 83.

Born in Kaanchaampuram, close to the coastal hamlet of Thaengaaipattinam near Kanniyakumari-Kerala border in 1937 to Maluk Mohammed and Ayisha Beevi, Abubucker was attracted by his maternal uncle M.P.V. Hasan’s outstanding singing skills in Tamil, Malayalam and Arabic, who also taught his nephew the history of Prophet Mohamed.

Since his unique voice attracted many, Abubucker got the chance to showcase his talent at the age of 15 in a mosque. “He was a self-made singer, who could reach any high note that his voice attracted Mohamed Ali-Shali brothers of Thiruvananthapuram when they happened to hear his performance at Poovar Noohu Oliyullah Dhargah,” says K.M.A. Nizam, MDMK’s Tirunelveli City district secretary.

Encouraged by the compliments, his discourses and devotional concerts that were organised in mosques in Panachchamoodu, Kadayalaumoodu, Kaliyakkavilai, Paarasaala and other areas created a huge following in these areas when he was just 18 years old.

“His contribution in taking Seeraapuraanam, Rajanayagam, Kunangudi Mastan Saheb Songs, Sorganeedhi, Nabhimargal Varalaaru, Mohideen Maalai, Kavi Moosa’s songs, among others, with Carnatic flavour to the masses is matchless,” recalls freedom fighter Kodikkaal Shaik Abdullah.

Apart from Carnatic-flavored Islamic devotional songs, Abubucker’s rendition of folk songs earned him fans from all walks of life and even beyond the geographical boundaries of Tamil Nadu and Kerala as his unique voice could be heard everywhere through television. Almost all mosques across Tamil Nadu might have hosted his discourse on Seerapuraanam and Tamil literature associated with Islam on special occasions.

Though Abubucker’s efforts to enter the tinsel world did not yield desirable results for him, his discourses and devotional concerts continued for long. His association with lyricist Ka. Mu. Sheriff gave different dimension to his Islamic discourses organised even in Singapore, Malaysia and Dubai.

“After Abubucker singing a portion of Seeraapuraanam in his mesmerizing voice, Sheriff would speak in detail about this portion that attracted huge crowd everywhere they performed,” MDMK singer Puliyangudi Abubucker says.

Though several titles were conferred on him, Abubucker loved the the title, Isaiyarvi the most, as rain would also be a visitor to his concerts and discourses on most of the occasions, says Mr. Nizam.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/eb0qs8/article32805994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA09-SINGER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/kumari-isaiyarvui-abubucker-no-more/article32804835.ece

328,2020/10/08,Madurai MP deplores practice of PSU sending insurance renewal notices in Hindi and English,"Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan has said that this practice of the National Insurance Company ignores the sentiments and needs of its customers

The National Insurance Company has sent insurance renewal notices printed in Hindi and English, to its policy-holders in Tamil Nadu, ignoring the regional language.

Madurai MP, Su. Venkatesan, has drawn the attention of its Chairman-cum-Managing Director, Tajinder Mukherjee, contending that customers here were not in a position to grasp the full import of the communication intended through the notices.

He pointed out that in an era of competition, public sector general insurers were struggling to retain their market shares vis-a-vis private insurers, in the field. Against this backdrop, it is natural on the part of customers to expect the language of the communications sent by service providers to be near and dear to their hearts. Most of the people in Tamil Nadu are not aware of Hindi and this is the reason for the solemn assurance given by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1963 that the Official Languages Act would not be imposed on the people of Tamil Nadu, the MP said.

“It is disgusting to note that National Insurance Company Limited has started printing renewal notices and policy bonds in Hindi and English, ignoring the sentiments and needs of customers,” he said. He wondered why National Insurance Company Limited has started such a practice while many other Central PSUs have not resorted to it so far. Options have been given in some institutions to get forms or documents in Hindi, and it is purely on the basis of choice of the policy-holders.

This move of National Insurance Company is not wise even in the angles of both business procurement and winning over the hearts of the clientèle, he said.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP said that usage of Hindi in forms may be dispensed with, and the same should be made available in regional languages including Tamil, for the benefit of all customers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/cov1sm/article32797516.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA08-SUVENKATESAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/madurai-mp-deplores-practice-of-psu-sending-insurance-renewal-notices-in-hindi-and-english/article32801688.ece

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday took a serious view of the PM Kisan Scheme scam, in which money was fraudulently credited to thousands of ineligible people. The court put forth a series of questions for both the Centre and the State and observed that the benefits were not reaching actual farmers.

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that agriculturalists had become orphans and in spite of various schemes floated for their benefit, they were not empowered. Agriculture sector was the only sector where the producer had no say in fixing the price of the produce, the court said.

The judges ordered notices to the Ministry of Agriculture and the Tamil Nadu Department of Agriculture and sought response to a series of queries. The court asked the Centre and the State to submit in the next hearing the number and the names of schemes floated for the benefit of farmers in the last 10 years and whether the benefits were reaching the farmers.

It also sought to know how much the governments had spent on such schemes including the PM Kisan scheme, how much was the subsidy under each scheme and if there were any mechanism to monitor the intended reach of the schemes. It asked whether the malpractices committed were detected and cases filed against corrupt officials.

Further, with regard to the PM Kisan Scheme scam, the court asked what the actual position was now and how many cases were registered against those involved in the scam.

The court was hearing a PIL petition filed by A. Sivaperumal from Nallamanarkottai in Dindigul district, who complained that ineligible people were enrolled under the scheme.

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. D’Souza said that the probe should be conducted either by the Anti Corruption Bureau or the Lokayukta. He said that the project cost got escalated by three times from the initial estimated cost. People were suspicious over the cost as well as the detailed project report, he said.

Mr. D’Souza said that despite two years of the commencement of the Smart City project, not a single work has been completed; as such, there was a need for public audit too. MSCL should make public a list of completed projects and the amount spent to facilitate a debate, he said.

The former MLC wondered why neither Mangaluru City Corporation nor MSCL were able to take up construction of the railway overbridge at Mahakalipadpu in South Mangaluru. Even land acquisition was not completed for the ₹ 40-crore project, he said.

He said that the grants that had to be given to the city corporation were being allocated to MSCL. Thus, the process has become non-transparent. Expenditure made towards public purposes need to be made transparent. Though ₹ 8 crore was sanctioned for the development of eight lakes in Mangaluru Urban Development Authority limits several months ago, work was yet to commence.

333,2020/10/08,"Permit token performance of Pili Vesha, says samiti","Samiti president Dilraj Alva and members submit memorandum to Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra.

The Dasara Shobhayatre Samiti, Mangaladevi Temple, on Thursday urged the district administration to permit token performance of Pili Vesha or Huli Vesha during the Navaratri chariot festivals of Mangaladevi and Mariyamma temples.

Samiti president Dilraj Alva and members submitted a memorandum to Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra in the matter here.

Mr. Alva said that Pili Vesha was being performed not for pomp and gaiety, but as a Seva (service) to the deities. As such, the administration should allow its token performance during the Rathotsava of the two temples from October 24 to 26.

He said that the samiti held a meeting on Wednesday in view of the restrictions imposed by the administration on the festivities. It decided to deploy one member each from 10 Pili Vesha teams of the region for the token performance.

Mr. Alva told The Hindu that the Deputy Commissioner heard them patiently and assured them of considering the demand during a meeting of temple administrations on October 13.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/bjwk79/article32809901.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09MNPILIVESHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/permit-token-performance-of-pili-vesha-says-samiti/article32804738.ece

335,2020/10/08,DaanUtsav marks the Mahatma’s birth anniversary at MAHE,"Manipal Academy of Higher Education (MAHE) organised a week-long festival, “DaanUtsav 2020” between October 2 and October 8 to mark the 151st birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

Volunteer Services Organisation (VSO), the social unit of MAHE, held an array of “Virtual Giving and Volunteering” activities for students, staff and their family members along with the constituent institutes of MAHE to celebrate the “Joy of Giving”, said a release here.

Various activities, including mask making, yoga sessions named “Relax, Breathe and Repeat” and Rags to Bags-Making carry bags from old t-shirts, were initiated virtually. Virtual projects such as Health Bites - to maintain balanced diet and build immunity and Salute to COVID warriors - wherein students express their gratitude virtually, were also planned.

With an intent to Gyaan Daan, VSO engaged student volunteers in curating an Activity Workbook, including crossword, riddles, puzzles, short stories, for underprivileged children in the eight-12 age group.

Rangat – a cultural extravaganza was held wherein volunteers submitted entries under the categories of Dance, Music and Dramatics virtually, which would be compiled and reposted for the residents of Asare and Hombelaku - rehabilitation centres for specially challenged individuals and people with mental disorders, respectively, and also for nearby slums and orphanages of Udupi.

To contribute to Nature, VSO has initiated a project, “Plant a sapling”, wherein student volunteers from various parts of India are encouraged to plant a sapling or a stem in their houses and contribute towards a greener earth. To instil the value of generosity in children, VSO has collaborated with Madhavakripa Schools, where the primary school children are encouraged to make Box of Happiness containing “7 days-7 items” to be sent to villages in rural India with the collaboration and support of Goonj.

336,2020/10/08,Apartments in rural areas told to build waste treatment plants in three months,"With a view to preventing the flow of untreated sewage into the open in rural areas, the Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat will direct multi-storeyed apartments to construct sewage treatment plants (STPs) on their premises. The gram panchayats concerned will issue notices to such buildings to get STPs built in three months, Chief Executive Officer R. Selvamani said on Thursday.

Speaking at the general meeting of the panchayat here, Mr. Selvamani said that notices would be served on all apartments that were letting out untreated sewage into the open. “They (apartment owners/residents association) would be given three months to set up STPs. If they fail to set up STPs, the panchayats would take action,” he said.

Mr. Selvamani told reporters later that the panchayats would withdraw no objection certificates issued to such residential apartments. In case of commercial complexes, the panchayats would not renew trade licence.

He said that directions were issued to taluk panchayat executive officers to ensure documents under Forms 9 and 11 were issued by gram panchayats to the newly built multi-storeyed buildings only if they have STPs built as per set standards. “If we find that Forms 9 and 11 were issued to buildings without STPs, the executive officers concerned would be held responsible,” he added.

Panchayat member Mamata D.S. Gatty pointed out that many multi-storeyed buildings in Mudipu and other villages were letting out untreated sewage in the open. “Mudipu and other villages were fast developing. We should prevent such transgressions,” she added.

To this, Mr. Selvamani said that the State government has issued directions to take action against those who were letting untreated sewage directly into the river course. “Survey of the riverbed from Uppinangady to Thumbe is being done,” he said. A committee headed by a Range Forest Officer would submit a report about STPs that need to be set up in this region. “I will submit a report on this to the government in a fortnight,” he said.

When some members pointed out the lack of funds coming from the State government for development works in the district, MLC Pratap Simha Nayak said that the government was taking advances to complete the ongoing development works.

He said private primary and secondary teachers continue to get paltry salaries. Though the apex court has said that these teachers should be paid ₹30,500 and ₹20,200 respectively per month, most private schools were not doing so. “The problem has been precarious in the last seven months as many teachers have lost jobs. They are forced to take up odd jobs to run their families.” The State government is yet to take action.

339,2020/10/08,More space in new residential quarters for pourakarmikas,"‘As much as 60 % of beneficiaries have agreed to move in’

Responding to the demand for more floor area for their quarters, the Mangaluru City Corporation has proposed to increase floor area for the 32 one-bedroom apartments to be constructed in the second phase of the construction of quarters for pourakarmikas, corporation Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said here on Wednesday.

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the pourakarmika Day, Mr. Sridhar said that the floor area of each house will be increased from 303 sq ft to 505 sq ft. The second phase of quarters construction will be taken up shortly after the completion of allocation of 32 quarters constructed in the first phase.

The corporation also needs to resolve the issue about retired pourakarmikas staying in the old quarters that needs to be brought down to build the new quarters in the second phase. Retired pourakarminkas are not eligible for quarters, he said.

It was in 2015 that the corporation took up the first phase of constructing 32 ground plus three floor quarters at Mahakalipadpu at an estimated cost of ₹ 2.40 crore. These houses are now ready for occupation.

Mr. Sridhar said that 60 % of the 32 beneficiaries have agreed to move to the new quarters. The remaining 40 % are not willing as they say that the houses were too small for their requirement. “ We are in talks with them and hope to resolve it,” he said. Senior councillor Premanand Shetty said that increase in the floor area of houses in the second phase entails increase in the per unit cost from ₹ 7 lakh to ₹ 11 lakh. “The corporation will bear this additional sum from the 24.1% funds earmarked for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes welfare,” he said. And, the third phase of construction of 32 quarters will be taken up shortly, he added.

Earlier, speaking at the function, Mr. Sridhar commended the services of pourakarmikas of the corporation and those attached to Antony Waste Management Cell Private Limited for keeping the streets of the city clean. He said that steps are being taken to repair the 12 ward offices and provide proper change room facility for pourakarmikas.

340,2020/10/08,Fishermen seek introduction of the latest communication technology,"Hundreds of fishermen lose life every year in the sea due to non-availability of modern connectivity technologies, including satellite-based navigation system, says association.

Prominent fishermen associations of the coastal districts on Wednesday sought immediate intervention by the Union and State governments in adopting modern technology, including satellite-based navigation system, for the fisheries sector to save life and improve livelihood of fishermen.

Speaking to reporters in Udupi, North Kanara District Cooperative Fish Marketing Federation chairman Ganapati Mangre noted that hundreds of fishermen lose life every year in the sea due to non-availability of modern connectivity technologies, including satellite-based navigation system. A sophisticated navigation system not only saves their life but also gives indications about the availability of catch.

South Canara and Udupi District Cooperative Fish Marketing Federation president Yashpal Suvarna said that the usual methods of communication and warnings were not adequate which came to be highlighted with the missing fishermen onboard the Suvarna Tribhuja last year. It is time that advanced communication and connectivity technologies that are already available are adopted to ensure the fishing sector gets benefited.

The leaders said, “The Union government must implement the technologies via standardising quality available across the States. We have tested BSNL’s transponder which has two-way data communication directly over satellite and works in the deep sea. We seek the Prime Minister’s direct intervention and request his government to broadly deploy the latest technology immediately. We need a solution today as any delay will continue to endanger the safety and security of fishermen in the sea.”

The latest communication technology would also increase productivity of fishing harvest, create world-class competitiveness, apart from addressing the challenge of ensuring fishermen’s safety. With the availability of new satellite technology, India today has access to services that can ensure the safety of fishermen through ubiquitous coverage that allow fishermen to communicate anywhere and even during the worst of storms, cyclones or other natural calamities.

They said that fish cooperatives and boat owners associations were supporting Indian Fishermen for Technology Adoption (IFTA) to bring out numerous issues being faced by fishermen. The focus would remain on digital transformation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/d2wyzw/article32798025.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08MNFISHERMENPRESSMEET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/fishermen-seek-introduction-of-the-latest-communication-technology/article32798026.ece
341,2020/10/08,World Bank widens GDP contraction forecast to 9.6%,"Poverty reduction suffers setback; ‘continue key reforms to reverse virus impact’

The World Bank expects India’s economy to contract by 9.6% in 2020-21, revising its earlier estimate in June that output will shrink by just 3.2% amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. This revision reflects ‘the impact of the national lockdown and the income shock experienced by households and firms’, the Bank explained.

In its South Asia Economic Focus report released on Thursday, the Bank reckoned there will be a rebound to 5.4% growth in 2021-22, but largely due to base effects and hinging on assumptions that the pandemic-related restrictions are completely lifted by 2022.

India’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 23.9% in the first quarter of this year and official estimates for the second quarter are expected at end-November. The Bank mooted continuation of critical reforms to reverse the sudden and steep impacts of COVID-19.

“Monetary policy has been deployed aggressively and fiscal resources have been channelled to public health and social protection, but additional counter-cyclical measures will be needed, within a revised medium-term fiscal framework.

“Despite measures to shield vulnerable households and firms, the trajectory of poverty reduction has slowed, if not reversed,” the Bank said on India. It said significant disruptions to jobs likely boosted the poverty rate, with 2020 rates back to levels in 2016.

“Policy interventions have preserved the normal functioning of financial markets thus far. However, the demand slowdown could lead to rising loan delinquencies and risk aversion,” it noted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ol3ebn/article32807174.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09BUSHOPKEEPERVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/world-bank-widens-gdp-contraction-forecast-to-96/article32807175.ece
342,2020/10/08,Q2 records 107% surge in fresh investments,"Chhattisgarh, TN lead in with ₹35,771 cr, ₹23,332 cr respectively

Fresh investment proposals surged sharply in the second quarter of this year, rising 107% over the first quarter, with 2,219 new projects entailing an investment of ₹2.19 lakh crore.

Private sector investments also recovered significantly, rising 87% from the previous quarter when an extensive lockdown triggered a 23.9% contraction in the economy.

On a year-on-year basis, fresh investments between July and September were still 11.32% lower, but marked a sharp recovery from investments in the first quarter that were nearly 73% lower.

Among the States, Chhattisgarh received the highest investments in the second quarter followed by Tamil Nadu, which had topped fresh investments in the first quarter, according to Projects Today’s latest report on investment announcements in the July to September quarter. Karnataka was third in the list followed by Gujarat and Maharashtra.

Chhattisgarh's total investments in the quarter of ₹35,771 crore were boosted by the ₹22,653 crore Bodhghat irrigation project and public sector coal mining projects worth ₹8,200 crore. Tamil Nadu received 132 projects worth ₹23,332 crore in the same period.

Projects Today director and CEO Shashikant Hegde said it would be too early to proclaim the return of normalcy, but the impressive increase in fresh investment proposals, increased tendering activities and a sharp jump in the number of finalised project contracts in Q2 vis-à-vis the preceding quarter indicates a bounce back in projects investment activities in India.

Labour, supply chains

“The project implementation ratio (projects investment under execution as percentage of total outstanding investment) improved by a tad, from 37% in Q1 to 37.53% in Q2. This indicates that at ground level, project execution has not gained much traction in the second quarter. The pain issues like scarcity of labour, supply chain disruption and liquidity persisted in Q2 too,” Mr Hegde told The Hindu.

Private sector investments in the second quarter were just 7% down from a year ago, with 618 new projects worth ₹83,608.2 crore. This was almost double the 315 new projects worth ₹44,714.6 crore announced in Q1, but still far less than the average quarterly investments of ₹1.69 lakh crore and ₹1.32 lakh crore in 2018-19 and 2019-20, respectively.

While the surge in fresh projects investments was spread across all major sectors, the growth registered in the manufacturing sector was very interesting, the firm noted in its quarterly project monitoring report. Fresh manufacturing investments rose 31.3% from the previous quarter and were even 19.8% higher than the second quarter of 2019-20.

Manufacturing, realty

“In all, 315 new projects worth ₹35,195.68 crore were announced in Q2, of which about 96% came from private promoters,” the report noted. A solar cells and modules project of Vikram Solar in Tamil Nadu worth ₹5,423 crore was the largest private manufacturing investment announced, followed by Edison Motors electric vehicles project in Uttar Pradesh worth ₹5,000 crore.

As many as 98 new pharma and drug projects were announced, most of which were to produce Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, or APIs, currently imported from China. Jubilant Generics’ ₹864 project to make APIs and pharmaceutical intermediates in Karnataka was the largest pharma bet in the quarter.

Infrastructure continued to account for half of all fresh projects in the second quarter, rising from 1,085 projects worth ₹58,583 crore in Q1 to 1,751 projects worth almost ₹1.16 lakh crore.

Real estate and construction, one of the largest job creators in recent years, also saw a recovery of sorts with new project announcements reverting to virtually the same levels as a year ago.

“Although the staggered unlocking of the economy in Q2/FY21 did not lead to increase in the pace of project execution due to labour and liquidity issues, the announcement of new projects gained momentum,” the report said.

New commercial realty projects doubled from 224 (worth ₹7,326 crore) in Q1 to 450 projects worth ₹33,969.3 crore in Q2. In the second quarter of 2019-20, 451 new projects worth ₹30,371.7 crore were announced.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mfpb8d/article32805410.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-construction,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/q2-records-107-surge-in-fresh-investments/article32805448.ece
343,2020/10/08,World Bank expects India’s GDP to contract by 9.6% this fiscal,"South Asia’s regional growth is expected to contract by 7.7% in 2020, after topping 6% annually in the past five years.

The World Bank on Thursday said that India’s GDP is expected to contract by 9.6% this fiscal which is reflective of the national lockdown and the income shock experienced by households and firms due to the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that the country’s economic situation is much worse than ever seen before.

The Washington-based global lender, in its latest South Asia Economic Focus report ahead of the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, forecasts a sharper than expected economic slump across the region, with regional growth expected to contract by 7.7% in 2020, after topping 6% annually in the past five years.

India’s GDP is expected to contract by 9.6% in the fiscal year that started in March, the World Bank said in the report released in Washington. Regional growth is projected to rebound to 4.5% in 2021, it said.

Factoring in population growth, however, income-per-capita in the region will remain 6% below 2019 estimates, indicating that the expected rebound will not offset the lasting economic damage caused by the pandemic, it said.

The situation is much worse in India than we have ever seen before, Hans Timmer, World Bank Chief Economist for South Asia told reporters during a conference call. “It is an exceptional situation in India. A very dire outlook,” he said.

Also Read India ranks 116 in World Bank’s human capital index

There was a 25% decline in GDP in the second quarter of the year, which is the first quarter of the current fiscal year in India.

In the report, the World bank said that the spread of the coronavirus and containment measures have severely disrupted supply and demand conditions in India.

With the intent to contain the spread of COVID-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with effect from March 25, announced a nationwide complete lockdown that brought as much as 70% of economic activity, investment, exports and discretionary consumption to a standstill. Only essential goods and services such as agriculture, mining, utility services, some financial and IT services and public services were allowed to operate.

Dubbed as the world’s biggest lockdown, it shut a majority of the factories and businesses, suspended flights, stopped trains and restricted movement of vehicles and people.

According to the World Bank, monetary policy has been deployed aggressively and fiscal resources have been channeled to public health and social protection, but additional counter-cyclical measures will be needed, within a revised medium-term fiscal framework.

Despite measures to shield vulnerable households and firms, the trajectory of poverty reduction has slowed, if not reversed, it said.

“We have seen from the rapid survey that many people have lost their jobs,” Mr. Timmer said, adding that this is happening against a background when India’s economy was already slowing down before the pandemic.

“We had seen a rise in non-performing loans. Those are all vulnerabilities that India has to deal with,” he said.

Responding to a question, Mr. Timmer said what the Indian government has done with limited resources and limited fiscal space is very impressive.

“We have seen a loosening of monetary policy. You have seen attempts to increase credit to the private sector to help a company survive,” he said, adding that there have been big efforts in the health sector and expansion of a social safety net.

“But with every big crisis, I think, we have to realise that this will not go over anytime soon. And it will actually change the longer-term future also. What this reveals is really as good as federal policies, especially the policies related to the informal sector,” he added.

“There’s a big problem that the informal sector has no coverage in social insurance. What we see now is that especially the informal workers in the middle of the income distribution have lost their jobs. There are no systems in place to support those people,” Mr. Timmer said.

Responding to another question, Mr. Timmer said that as a result of COVID-19, the World Bank estimates that in one year, the number of people living below the poverty line has increased by 33%.

In its report, the World Bank said that the response of the government of India to the COVID-19 outbreak was swift and comprehensive. A strict lockdown was implemented to contain the health emergency.

To mitigate its impact on the poorest, it was complemented by social protection measures; to ensure that businesses could maintain their operations, the Reserve Bank of India and the government also provided liquidity and other regulatory support, it said.

Nonetheless, there was a massive contraction in output and poor and vulnerable households experienced significant social hardships — specifically urban migrants and workers in the informal economy, the Bank said.

After fiscal 2017, during which the economy grew at 8.3%, growth decelerated in each subsequent year to 7.0, 6.1 and 4.2%.

This was on account of two mutually reinforcing dynamics: emerging weaknesses in non-bank financial companies (a major source of credit growth, making up for risk aversion from banks) and slowing private consumption growth, the bank added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ubc9i0/article31382012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HansTimmer,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/world-bank-expects-indias-gdp-to-contract-by-96-this-fiscal/article32801181.ece

345,2020/10/08,"‘Google holding app developers to ransom’, says Paytm’s Vijay Shekhar Sharma","Paytm’s Sharma asks govt. to intervene

Paytm’s Vijay Shekhar Sharma on Thursday stepped up his fight against Google as he sought government intervention to help create a level playing field so as to “not allow somebody [to hold] to ransom” Indian app developers and to ensure all stakeholders complied with Indian laws.

He also alleged that Google was acting like a “toll collector instead of trying to enable the ecosystem”.

Mr. Sharma has rallied about 100 homegrown firms in opposing Google Play Store’s new norms mandating the use of its billing system after March 2022, which would entail app developers needing to pay 30% transaction fee for all digital goods sold via their apps to Play Store. The group also plans to form a united front against global firms such as Google, Apple and Facebook, he said.

Paytm aims to onboard one million apps on its new Android ‘mini app store’ in the next year or so, coinciding with the deadline for new Google Play rules, Mr. Sharma said, announcing a ₹10 crore “equity investment” scheme for mini app developers in the country.

“The biggest role that the government can play is [to] create a level playing field for us, and not let somebody ransom us... that number is so costly that very less number of digital firms can expect to be profitable…We all, as Indian entrepreneurs, businesses, homegrown technology companies, need support from the government,” he told The Hindu, adding that their expectation was that government should ensure that Google and other big technology companies followed Indian laws, and to not let them build and deploy arbitrary rules.

“We are saying repeatedly that we cannot have these big tech companies coming to court and saying your laws [Indian laws] don't apply to us... So, effectively as an Indian business or Indian app developer, I don't have a recourse,” Mr. Sharma said.

A group of Indian tech businesses had also reached out to MeitY last Saturday to detail their concerns on the issue and seek government intervention.

Murugavel Janakiraman, Founder-CEO of Matrimony.com Ltd, who participated in the developers’ conference held by Paytm on Thursday, said that with almost all digital services needing to pay “this commission or tax”, Indian digital goods will become even more expensive as start-ups will have to factor the 30% charge.

“This is almost like charging customers 30% of their wedding expenses every time a couple meets and weds through us,” Mr. Janakiraman said.

Vishal Gondal, founder and CEO of GOQii, added that these issues were not new, but that start-ups have now banded together to take on the big tech firms, while stressing that the core issue was that these firms got away saying that they were not regulated by laws and rules in India.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fnvdv6/article32807196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09BUVIJAYSHANKARSHARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/google-holding-app-developers-to-ransom/article32807197.ece
346,2020/10/08,No foreign flights at cost of Indian carriers: Puri,"Remarks come amid ‘air bubble’ row

Foreign carriers will not be allowed flights into India at the expense of Indian carriers, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Puri warned on Thursday at a time when India is in the process of negotiating and renegotiating special bilateral arrangements with different countries for allowing limited number of direct flights from and to India.

“Foreign carriers are allowed to fly into India, but the time has come for the message to go out loud and clear that this will be not done at the expense of Indian carriers,” Mr. Puri said at a press conference.

The remarks were made days after the first-ever meeting with Germany’s Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure and India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation on the “air bubble” agreement which recently broke forcing both Lufthansa and Air India to cancel their October flights between the two countries. Another meeting is scheduled between the two sides on Friday.

“Negotiations are on and we are hopeful of a resolution soon,” diplomatic sources said.

In a veiled reference to Middle-Eastern carriers as well as other airlines that fly passengers via its hubs to destinations in the U.S. and Europe, Mr. Puri said, “India-U.S. market is a $7 billion market, but the share of Indian carriers is only 17%. This is not to say that U.S. carriers are getting the balance. But we are not insisting on total parity, but even near parity will do.”

Air India is the only Indian carrier that flies to both the U.S. and Europe. Vistara recently launched flights to London and SpiceJet too has plans for London and other long-haul international destinations.

Until September 30, foreign carriers operated 5,120 flights to and from India while Indian carriers operated 2,260 flights, Mr. Puri said adding that while Lufthansa operated 21 flights per week to its destinations in Germany, the latter allowed India only three weekly flights. However, industry sources contested the figure attributed to Lufthansa.

The bone of contention between the two countries is also the “sixth freedom of the air”, or flights operated between two countries via the home State of the carrier. India views Lufthansa’s operations through Frankfurt, into Europe, U.S. and Canada as a threat for its airlines.

Industry sources though say that it is commercially unviable for Lufthansa to fly only direct flights to Munich and Frankfurt

Pre-COVID levels

Indian aviation could see passenger traffic reaching pre-COVID-19 levels as soon as the end of 2020, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Puri said.

“Between Diwali and end of the year we will not only reach pre-COVID levels, but into the first quarter of the next year we will also surpass pre-COVID levels,” Mr. Puri said at a press briefing.

He said that these expectations were based on the traffic figures witnessed in the first week of October, which is above 1,50,000 unique passenger trips or 50% of pre-COVID levels.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/f9kpll/article32670669.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARDEEPSINGHPURI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/no-foreign-flights-at-cost-of-indian-carriers-puri/article32807099.ece
347,2020/10/08,"Jio designed to help India lead fourth industrial revolution, says Mukesh Ambani","He said his group’s telecom and digital unit Jio was conceived to provide the key ingredients needed to lead the fourth industrial revolution.

Having missed most of the first three industrial revolutions, India has its chance to lead the fourth industrial revolution through a convergence of its IT prowess, ultra-high-speed internet connectivity and affordable smart devices, billionaire Mukesh Ambani said on Thursday.

Mr. Ambani, who heads the company Reliance Industries Limited, said his group’s telecom and digital unit Jio was conceived to provide the key ingredients needed to lead the fourth industrial revolution.

India missed the first two industrial revolutions and the changes brought about by them. During the third industrial revolution, when information technology came to prominence, India joined the race but still remained behind, trying to catch up with the leaders.

“As we step into the fourth industrial revolution, India has the opportunity, not just to catch up with the leaders but to emerge as a global leader itself,” he said at TM Forum’s Digital Transformation World Series.

The fourth industrial revolution, he said, is driven by the convergence of digital and physical technologies such as digital connectivity, cloud and edge-computing, IoT and smart devices, artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain, AR/VR (Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality) and genomics.

“And the three foundational requirements needed to participate in this revolution are ultra-high-speed connectivity, affordable smart devices and transformational digital apps. Jio was conceived to enable this journey,” he said.

Before Jio, India was stuck with 2G technology. “Jio wanted to end India’s data misery and unleash a digital revolution,” he said. “We built a world-class, all-IP, future-proof digital network that delivers the highest speeds and the best coverage across India”.

While it took 25 years for the Indian telecom industry to build its 2G network, Jio built its 4G network in only three years. “And to ensure widespread adoption of data, we launched with the lowest data tariffs in the world and made voice services completely free for Jio users,” he said adding JioPhone made smartphones affordable.

“That provided a window to the world of limitless possibilities for over 100 million Indians in less than a year,” he said. Jio also offered a bouquet of mobile apps and data at a dirt-cheap rate.

The result was Jio added 7 customers per second and India’s monthly data consumption went up from 0.2 billion GB to 1.2 billion GB, a growth of 600%.

“Today, India consumes over 6 exabytes of data every month, more than 30 times pre-Jio levels, just four years ago,” he said. “We have gone from 155th in the world to number one in mobile data consumption in just four years.”

Stating that Jio shattered the widely held belief that India is not ready to adopt advanced technologies, Mr. Ambani said the country will play a leading role in the fourth industrial revolution.

To further extend our global leadership in connectivity, Jio is now rolling out a high-speed, low-latency optical fibre network to more than 50 million homes and premises. Also, Jio is preparing for rolling out 5G services across India.

Mr. Ambani said Jio Platforms, the group’s digital solutions arm, has built significant capabilities in areas such as cloud computing, big data analytics, AI and machine learning, blockchain, AR/VR and IoT.

“Using these technologies, Jio Platforms is in the process of creating compelling solutions for multiple industry verticals and ecosystems spanning telecom, media and entertainment, newCommerce, financial services, education, healthcare and agriculture,” he said.

The fourth industrial revolution presents a unique opportunity to create unprecedented value and prosperity and “we must invest in building next-generation technology assets,” he said.

“We must root out inefficiencies across the digital ecosystem. We must break silos and forge winning partnerships. Only then can we build and sustain a truly digital society,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/2mbqen/article31145157.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23IN-AMBANI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/jio-designed-to-help-india-lead-fourth-industrial-revolution-says-mukesh-ambani/article32803276.ece

350,2020/10/08,Puri sounds positive on domestic air travel,"It could see traffic reaching pre-COVID 19 levels as soon as the end of 2020

Indian aviation could see passenger traffic reaching pre-COVID 19 levels as soon as the end of 2020, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri said in an optimistic note for the industry, which had expected normalcy to return only by the second half of 2021.

“Between Diwali and end of the year we will not only reach pre-COVID-19 levels of 3,00,00 [passengers a day]”, but into the first quarter of the next year, we will also surpass pre-COVID-19 levels”, he said at a press briefing.

These expectations were based on the traffic figures witnessed in October first week, which was above 1,50,000 unique passenger trips, he noted.

351,2020/10/08,Paytm aims to support 1 million apps on Mini App Store,"Paytm founder added that the company is committed to developing India’s technology ecosystem.

Paytm on Thursday said it aims to support one million apps on its recently launched Android Mini App Store as part of its efforts to support Indian developers and compete against tech giant Google.

The company will also invest ₹ 10 crore for the app developers on its platform.

Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma - who has been vociferously voicing his concerns around the “monopolistic” behaviour of the US-based company - said with its steep 30 % fee, Google has started to play the role of a “toll collector” instead of enabling the ecosystem.

“App developers are dependent on a giant monopoly, Google and Google has started to play like a toll collector instead of trying to enable the ecosystem only...we will bring one million app before Google opens its charging obligation on each Indian developers,” he said.

He added that the company is committed to developing India’s technology ecosystem.

“Programmers and developers in India can build, they are not just the back office developers...We are the developers who can build the best apps... We are announcing a ₹ 10 crore investment fund for app developers...these investment terms will be one of the most lenient investment terms that you can expect,” Mr. Sharma said.

Paytm had said over 300 app-based service providers have already joined the programme, including the likes of Decathlon, Domino’s Pizza, FreshMenu, Netmeds, NoBroker, Ola, and more. These apps are expected to make their way to the Mini App Store soon.

Paytm had announced the launch of its Android Mini App Store earlier this week, just weeks after Paytm’s app was blocked from Google Play Store for a few hours for violating the Google’s policy on sports betting activities.

Mini apps are a custom-built mobile website that gives users app-like experience without having to download them. This would help users with limited data and phone memory.

On September 18, Google had blocked Paytm from its Play Store for a few hours for violating its policy on sports betting activities.

The app was later restored after the fintech app removed the ‘cashback’ feature linked to a game on the app.

Paytm had alleged that it was “arm-twisted” by the search engine major to comply with its biased Play Store policies “that are meant to artificially create Google’s market dominance”.

In the days that followed, Google clarified its Play policies to say that apps that chose to sell digital content through its Play Store, would have to use Google Play billing system and pay a percentage of the in-app purchase as a fee.

Google has faced ire from Indian developers with many saying the tech giant cannot force Indian app developers/owners to sell digital services by compulsorily using its billing system.

There were also calls for a local app store to offer more choice to developers and consumers.

It was then that Google had said it was extending the time for developers in India to integrate with the Play billing system to March 31, 2022.

Paytm - which competes with Google Pay in the fintech space - had said the listing of apps on its platform would be free. Any transactions using Paytm wallet, Paytm Payments Bank account and UPI would be at zero charges and 2 per cent for other instruments like credit cards.

352,2020/10/08,Passenger vehicle retail sales grow for the first time since March,"Total vehicle retail sales continue to be on the decline.

Total vehicle retail sales in the country continued to decline year-on-year in September 2020, even as passenger vehicle registrations turned positive for the first time since March growing at 9.81% during the month, as per data from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations.

Total vehicle registrations fell to 13.44 lakh units in September 2020, down 10.24% from about 14.98 lakh units in the year-ago month. However, month-on-month, the registrations saw double-digit growth of 11.45%, raising hopes of “high growth period” in the months of October and November due to the upcoming navratri, Durga puja and Diwali festivals.

The data released on Thursday showed that passenger vehicle registrations grew 9.81% to over 1.95 lakh units, while two-wheelers registrations declined 12.62% to 10.16 lakh units and commercial vehicle registrations fell 33.65% to 39,600 units.

Tractor registrations continued their good run zooming 80.39% to 68,564 units.

“With social distancing on customer’s mind coupled with government’s push to further normalise business conditions, and banks becoming more considerate to finance vehicles, entry level passenger vehicles saw good demand, thus indicating a preference for personal transportation over public,” FADA President Vinkesh Gulati said, adding that new launches and a lower base from last year aided the positive PV growth.

He added that tractor sales continued the “dream run” as Kharif sowing witnessed strong progress in terms of area covered till date compared to last year. Additionally, with good Rabi season driving growth in disposable income, rural markets “saw its rub off effect on 2-Wheeler, small passenger vehicles and small commercial vehicles”.

“While till recently the economic revival was mostly limited to rural India...the top States which make up half of India’s economic output (Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and West Bengal) are now showing signs of revival...This has also helped in creating a demand for automobile sales,” Mr Gulati said.

Talking about the outlook, the industry body said it anticipates “high growth” driven by festive demand in October and November coupled with no more lockdowns.

“As a caveat, with festival season round the corner and elections approaching in Bihar, the risk of Covid spread resurging may play a spoilsport in specific regions. Inventory for 2W stands at 45-50 days and PV stands at 35-40 days. Any dampener in vehicle sales during the upcoming festivals will have a catastrophic impact on dealers financial health,” FADA warned.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/wglqbo/article32565029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/automobile-sector,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/passenger-vehicle-retail-sales-grow-for-the-first-time-since-march/article32801470.ece

Zee Entertainment Enterprise Ltd (ZEEL) on Wednesday said its Independent Director Manish Chokhani has paid a fine of ₹8.20 lakh for violation of insider trading norms.

The company has transferred the said amount to the Investor Protection and Education Fund (IPEF) administered by market regulator Sebi, ZEEL said in a regulatory filing.

“The said Designated Person (Mr. Chokhani) has remitted a fine of ₹8.20 lakh to the Company’s account and the Company in turn has transferred the said amount to IPEF administered by SEBI, it said.

Mr. Chokhani had acquired one lakh equity shares of ZEEL at an average price of ₹200 in August this year.

The shares were purchased in the name of a partnership firm on August 19, 2020 — one day after publication of Q1 2020 financial results but before the trading window could open as scheduled after 48 hours of publication of results.

The purchase was made on the mistaken belief that the trading window is automatically reopened, and also without applying for pre-clearance, it added.

Hey there, and welcome back to Clued In!

When you see a cryptic clue, here’s the first thing you want to do. You want to tell yourself (even if it takes some self-delusional conditioning method, even chanting or other self-affirmation techniques) that this is an easy solve that you already know the answer to. See, self-belief is rather underrated. And its effectiveness and potency really becomes obvious when you apply it in your attempts to solving cryptic crosswords.

If you believe you know the answer, you will get it. It’s easy as ABC.

The Hindu Cryptic #13061 | Afterdark | 13 Across CLUE: Ridiculous to weep holding first and last letters (5) Clue types : Cryptic, containment Definition : Ridiculous Answer : CRAZY Clue explained: This is kind of an easy one. Not just because it is just 5 letters long. Word length rarely ever determines difficulty. Just ask Shashi Tharoor. No, it’s easy because it involves a very clear fodder, a very clear indicator. Meaning you can tell exactly what the setter wants from you without much head-scratching. ‘To weep’ is clearly to CRY. ‘Holding’ clearly means containing or filled up by. And if you were paying attention in Kindergaten, you may recall that the ‘first and last letters’ are simply A and Z. So, if CRY contains A and Z, the new word is CRAZY (crazy easy, more like!)

358,2020/10/08,The identity game in Bihar politics,"The NDA, with its wide social base, seems to have an edge over both new and old players

Amid receding floodwaters and a raging pandemic, Bihar is going to polls in the coming weeks — the first Indian State to do so since the COVID-19 outbreak started this year. Routine election activities like canvassing and rallies are getting complicated, with the Election Commission issuing strict but confusing guidelines that remain vastly overlooked across the length and breadth of the State. However, after our single round of fieldwork in the State, it can be said that the political situation in Bihar is less confusing after all, as there seems to be a pattern to the electoral preferences of voters.

Old formula

Our field study across seven sub-regions of the State revealed that the Janata Dal (United) (JD-U)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) had an upper hand. The NDA this time has gone back to its formula of ‘BJP plus JD(U)’ that won two successive Assembly elections, before both the parties parted ways in 2013, only to come together again in 2017. The Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) of former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi has also rejoined the NDA. The NDA’s principal opponent, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagathbandhan, or the ‘Grand Alliance’, comprises the Congress and three Left parties — the CPI, the CPI(M) and the CPI(ML). Based on field insights, it could be inferred that the Nitish Kumar-led NDA seems likely to emerge victorious once again, while the Mahagathbandhan may find it difficult to strike a chord beyond their core base of Muslims and Yadavs despite having the opportunity to cash in on prevailing social, epidemic, economic and flood-related crises.

Bihar Assembly elections | BJP, JD(U) split seats evenly, to share with smaller allies

The principal reason for this is the complex socio-political fabric of Bihar. While the State BJP has predominantly been a ‘Baniya’ party, an upper caste comprising less than 1/5th of Bihar’s population, the RJD has commanded the support of a majority of Yadavs and Muslims, who form around 1/3rd of the State’s population. With both these parties and their mass-bases locked in an unequal contest, the key to power lies with the remaining sections — the non-Yadav OBCs (other backward classes) like Kurmis and Koeris, the EBCs (extremely backward classes) like Nishads, Nai-Kahars and Mandals, and the Mahadalits like Paswans, Musahars and Chamars. Barring the Paswans, who have mostly remained committed to Ram Vilas Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), the remaining social sections have stood firmly by Mr. Kumar, thus explaining his indispensability in Bihar’s politics.

This time too, little seems to have changed. Despite the fact that the sheen of Mr. Kumar’s image as the ‘Vikas Purush’ (development man) has petered out, the EBCs, the non-Yadav OBCs and Mahadalit voters we interacted with across the State unequivocally expressed that they will continue supporting him as ‘there is no better alternative’. Most of them accepted that they voted for the JD(U)-RJD-led Mahagathbandhan in 2015 and the NDA in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, showing the ‘transferability’ of Mr. Kumar’s diverse social base. It is this transferability that could change the fortunes of parties like the BJP or the RJD, which continue to remain locked in the plateaus of their respective social bases.

Though it may seem counter-intuitive, the only other political force that commands a relatively diverse support base in Bihar are the Left parties. However, their influence is limited to small pockets, not covering more than 50 seats in total. Because of the history of land struggles and militant agitations, the Left in Bihar developed a social base among the Mahadalits, the EBC-OBCs, Muslims, and even the poor from upper castes. This explains RJD’s new-found love for the Left.

Bihar Assembly polls | Party ticket eludes ex-Bihar police chief Gupteshwar Pandey for second time

Contrary to the prevailing argument that the deepening of identity politics has led to fragmentation of social bases of mainstream parties and the emergence of various caste leaders who could sway their support base, Bihar presents a different case. The new entrants, especially the Nishad-based Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) of Mukesh Sahani, the Kushwaha-based Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) of Upendra Kushwaha, and the Mahadalit-based HAM, have failed to make their mark. Even then, Mr. Kumar was more than willing to bring Mr. Manjhi back into the party fold, while Mr. Kushwaha and Mr. Sahani were shunned. What explains this differential treatment?

Symbolic vs. real appeal

The answer lies in the directionality of alliances chosen by the new caste leaders. The ground reality is that the people of a caste have a pre-existing political inclination wherein they want a symbolic leader to accentuate their importance. As long as the leader pitches for more power in the same direction as desired by the community, she or he is celebrated. However, any move in the opposite direction is shunned, as it is considered a threat to the core social base. Hence, attempts by Upendra Kushwaha to break the old Kurmi-Kushwaha core, part of Mr. Kumar’s base, led to Mr. Kushwaha’s isolation by community members. Similarly, Mr. Sahani, despite being praised, has been rejected in the past by community voters for siding with the RJD. In our field-study, Nishads in Darbhanga (Bahadurpur), Samastipur (Morwa), Madhubani (Harlakhi), Begusarai (Bachhwara) declared Mr. Kumar as their leader, while stating that though Mr. Sahani did good, he should have stayed with Mr. Kumar. So, while a ‘pressure group’ model, as long as it increases the community’s bargaining power, is good, an attack on traditional support that could jeopardise patronage and benefits is bad. Hence, breaking from a pre-existing strong anchor may not be feasible.

Bihar Assembly elections | Mahagathbandhan seals seat-sharing deal

Meanwhile, there seems to be a discernible change in the attitude of Muslim voters. While a majority of them remain with the RJD, the appeal of Mr. Kumar has disappeared profoundly post the unrest following the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Interestingly, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) leader, Asaduddin Owaisi, has emerged as a force with strong electoral viability in the Muslim-dominated Seemanchal region. During the 2015 election, we had found significant Muslim anger towards Mr. Owaisi for being a vote-spoiler by dividing the community’s vote, which meant an advantage for the BJP. However, post the Centre’s CAA move, Mr. Owaisi seems to be an absolute gainer and Mr. Kumar the loser of the minority community’s votes in Bihar.

In conclusion, armed with a wide social base of upper castes, the non-Yadav OBCs and a majority of Dalits, the NDA seems to have a decisive edge over the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan, which is struggling to find an appeal beyond its core support base of Muslims and Yadavs.

359,2020/10/08,The cost of political posturing,"The White House rule on a salary floor for H-1B visas has serious economic implications

U.S. President Donald Trump has done it again, and this time only a few weeks before a Presidential election — the 45th Commander-in-Chief has put another turn in the screws of his country’s immigration system by announcing a hike in the salaries for those arriving in the U.S. on H-1B or skilled-worker visas.

This is expected to cut visa applications by around 33%, according to experts, and it comes as only the latest White House rule following executive actions that earlier banned the issuance of new skilled worker visas and new green cards. The question that these policy changes beg is, how much of the motivation for them is pure economic rationale versus political value for the incumbent’s final stages of election campaigning?

Also read | U.S. imposes new curbs on H-1B visas

It would not be unreasonable to expect that the visa issuance ban, combined with the mandatory salary floor soon to be instituted, will seriously hit U.S. imports of services from India, estimated to be at $29.6 billion in 2018, 4.9% more than in 2017, and 134% more than 2008 levels. The skilled visa issuance picture has been a positive one to date: the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has been issuing 85,000 H-1B visas annually, of which 20,000 are given to graduate students and 65,000 to private sector applicants, approximately 70% of which are granted to Indian nationals.

The Migration Policy Institute has predicted that Mr. Trump’s June 22, 2020 ban on new H-1B visa issuance could impact up to 219,000 workers, who would effectively be blocked from taking up any potential jobs on offer in the U.S. going forward. But how likely are firms, including the Silicon Valley tech giants, to embark on recruitment drives at this economically depressed time in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic? Although unemployment in the U.S. peaked in the summer and has fallen for the fifth consecutive month since then, the latest figures suggest that both the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed people remain substantially higher than the pre-pandemic values in February 2020.

Even so, it is important to distinguish between the ban on new visa issuance and the Labour Department rule that would insist on higher salaries being paid to all H-1B visa workers in the U.S. Under the latter rule, assuming it stands the test of time and inevitable litigation, companies would be required to pay entry-level staff in the 45th percentile of their industry’s salary instead of the 17th percentile; for high-skilled workers, the rise would be from the 67th to the 95th percentile.

Staunch criticism

Speaking of litigation, it is telling that days before the Trump administration’s announcement of the proposed salary hike that makes H-1B hiring significantly more expensive to potential employers, a federal judge in the Northern District of California blocked the enforcement of the new visa ban, ruling that the President “exceeded his authority” under the U.S. Constitution. Driving that legal challenge to the White House proclamation was a swathe of U.S. manufacturing and industry associations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Retail Federation, TechNet, a technology industry group, and Intrax Inc., which sponsors cultural exchanges.

In a similar vein, Google CEO Sundar Pichai hit out at the ban, saying, “Immigration has contributed immensely to America’s economic success, making it a global leader in tech, and also Google the company it is today. Disappointed by today’s proclamation — we’ll continue to stand with immigrants and work to expand opportunity for all.” Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple CEO Tim Cook echoed similar sentiments.

This goes to the heart of the issue, the question of why Mr. Trump is willing to risk damage to corporate America’s bottom lines, all to garner some campaign ammunition for his familiar plank of nativist populism. The answer is a simple one: people vote, while companies do not. What might happen after the election is an entirely different story.

360,2020/10/08,Gig work and its skewed terms,"The new labour codes do little to provide better pay and definitive rights to platform workers

The new Code on Social Security allows a platform worker to be defined by their vulnerability — not their labour, nor the vulnerabilities of platform work.

Swiggy workers have been essential during the pandemic. Even so, they have faced a continuous dip in pay and no rewards for being essential workers. During the last six months, many platform workers have unionised under the All India Gig Workers Union and have protested day in and day out, deploring Swiggy for reducing their base pay from ₹35 to ₹10 per delivery order.

Also read | The ‘gig’ economy is creating lakhs of jobs, but workers don’t see a future

It has been truly remarkable to see the ‘food delivery’ identity being developed through collective action, just as that of Uber and Ola taxi drivers has been taking shape for a few years now. Stable terms of earning have been a key demand of delivery-persons and drivers through years of protests.

The three new labour codes passed by Parliament recently acknowledge platform and gig workers as new occupational categories in the making, in a bid to keep India’s young workforce secure as it embraces ‘new kinds of work’, like delivery, in the digital economy. But do the codes let Swiggy workers ask for the pay that they were promised? No. What a platform worker is allowed to claim as rights, responsibilities and working conditions that can be legally upheld is the key question in these codes, such as for factory workers, who have been an important industrial element in India and around the world. The specific issues of working in factories, the duration of time needed on a factory floor, and associated issues are recognised as the parameters for defining an ideal worker under most labour laws, and this has not shifted much.

Defining an ‘employee’

The Code on Wages, 2019, tries to expand this idea by using ‘wages’ as the primary definition of who an ‘employee’ is. The wage relationship is an important relationship in the world of work, especially in the context of a large informal economy. Even so, the terms ‘gig worker’, ‘platform worker’ and ‘gig economy’ appear elsewhere in the Code on Social Security.

Also read | ‘Most gig workers lost income during pandemic’

Since the laws are prescriptive, what is written within them creates the limits to what rights can be demanded, and how these rights can be demanded. Hence, the categories and where they appear become key signs for understanding what kind of identity different workers can have under these new laws. Platform delivery people can claim benefits, but not labour rights. This distinction makes them beneficiaries of State programmes. This does not allow them to go to court to demand better and stable pay, or regulate the algorithms that assign the tasks. This also means that the government or courts cannot pull up platform companies for their choice of pay, or how long they ask people to work.

The main role of the laws for a ‘platform worker’ is to make available benefits and safety nets from the government or platform companies. Even though platforms are part of the idea of how work will evolve in the future, the current laws do not see them as future industrial workers.

Comment | The future of work

No guarantees

In the Code on Social Security, 2020, platform workers are now eligible for benefits like maternity benefits, life and disability cover, old age protection, provident fund, employment injury benefits, and so on. However, eligibility does not mean that the benefits are guaranteed. None of these are secure benefits, which means that from time to time, the Central government can formulate welfare schemes that cover these aspects of personal and work security, but they are not guaranteed. Actualising these benefits will depend on the political will at the Central and State government-levels and how unions elicit political support. For some states like Karnataka, where a platform-focused social security scheme was in the making last year, this will possibly offer some financial assistance by the Centre. However, that is not assured. The language in the Code is open enough to imply that platform companies can be called upon to contribute either solely or with the government to some of these schemes. But it does not force the companies to contribute towards benefits or be responsible for workplace issues.

The ‘platform worker’ identity has the potential to grow in power and scope, but it will be mediated by politicians, election years, rates of under-employment, and large, investment- heavy technology companies that are notorious for not complying with local laws. But there are no guarantees for better and more stable days for platform workers, even though they are meant to be ‘the future of work’.

361,2020/10/08,"Four for one: On Quad, India and the U.S.","Whatever the benefits of Quad, India should not be led by the U.S. on regional initiatives

With the second meeting of the Australia-India-Japan-United States Quadrilateral Strategic Dialogue of Foreign Ministers in Tokyo on Tuesday, the Quad has entered a decisive phase. The Ministers, who had last met at the UN General Assembly, made a considered push to hold the meeting, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. In a departure from the earlier secrecy, they made public a large part of their deliberations, including the decision to make the FM meeting an annual event, to cooperate on combating the pandemic, and on building infrastructure, connectivity and a supply chain initiative in the region. As the host, Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga dispelled any notion that he might not be as proactive as his predecessor, Shinzō Abe, who originally conceived the idea in 2007. Australia’s Foreign Minister Marise Payne attended despite the two-week quarantine that she faces on return, and India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar undertook the journey despite the government’s preoccupation with the LAC standoff. But it is probably the U.S. that displayed the most eagerness to hold the meeting, just weeks before the Presidential election. Mr. Trump’s COVID-19 illness and sudden hospitalisation prompted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to cancel other scheduled stops, in South Korea and Mongolia. But in Tokyo, he made it clear that his mission was to direct the Quad towards building a coalition to counter Beijing’s aggression in the region, saying that their partnership was not “multilateralism for the sake of it”. He called on the entire Quad to “collaborate to protect” the region from what he called the “CCP’s exploitation, corruption, and coercion”, pointing to the LAC standoff, as well as Chinese aggression in the South and East China Seas. What he seemed to propose was not just a coalition of democracies committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific, as the Quad’s informal charter has thus far stated. Instead, the U.S. seems keen on turning the Quadrilateral into a full-fledged military alliance of countries facing tensions with China.

The government should not downplay the import of such openly stated intentions. While Japan and Australia are bound by alliance treaties to the U.S., New Delhi has thus far charted its course on strategic autonomy. Mr. Pompeo’s words could well be bluster borne of politics ahead of the U.S. elections, but they point to an interest in bringing India into bilateral tensions in the Indo-Pacific, while inviting the Quad to take a role in India-China tensions as well. The Modi government has rebuffed such suggestions, and any shift would be unwise now. India has much to gain strategically and in terms of capacity building from the Quadrilateral dialogue, but little from the impression it is being led by Washington on an important initiative for the region in which India is an equal and important stake-holder.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/four-for-one-the-hindu-editorial-on-quad-india-and-the-us/article32797257.ece
362,2020/10/08,The hole in the middle: The Hindu Editorial on 2020 Physics Nobel,"The physics Nobel celebrates both theoretical work and observational studies

This year’s Nobel prize in physics awards studies that established the existence of black holes. It celebrates theoretical work as much as it does dedicated observation. Andrea Ghez is only its fourth woman recipient. Roger Penrose, now at Oxford, who gets half the prize, ingeniously used mathematics in the 1960s to theorise under what conditions black holes must form. This was a time when the reality of black holes as a solution to Albert Einstein’s field equations of the General Theory of Relativity was not accepted by many prominent physicists. Within a couple of months after Einstein proposed his General Theory of Relativity in 1915, Karl Schwarzschild published a solution to the field equations that exhibited singularities, or points where physical quantities grew infinitely large or vanished. Today, this is understood as the event horizon — the point of no return beyond which even light cannot escape the black hole’s gravitational attraction. While more solutions were found to Einstein’s equations that suggested black holes, they all required special symmetries and their realisation under general astrophysical conditions was doubtful. Penrose, through the singularity theorems, identified the formation of trapped surfaces as the condition for the formation of black holes in a generic manner. In this climate came observational hints of supermassive black holes, through the discovery of what were initially called quasars that were supermassive and found at the centre of galaxies.

The other half of the prize is jointly awarded to Reinhard Genzel, at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, Garching, Germany, and Prof. Ghez, of the UCLA, U.S., for showing that the dense region in the centre of our galaxy — the Milky Way — is indeed a black hole. Towards the end of the 1960s it was clear that the region named Sagittarius A* occupies the centre of the Milky Way, which is about 26,000 light years away. Around this, all stars in the galaxy orbit. In the 1990s, when telescopes and equipment were developed that could tackle this distance, Prof. Genzel and Prof. Ghez set up independent groups to explore this region. They built unique instruments and pursued research from Very Large Telescope, in Chile, and the Keck Observatory, Hawaii, respectively. For three decades, the groups tracked nearly 30 stars, in particular one named S-2 (or S-O2). This star’s orbit has been nearly completely tracked. These stars followed elliptical, Keplerian, orbits, which can only imply a central concentrated massive object — a supermassive black hole. Thus, the prize strings together theoretical research from the 1960s driven by conviction, and a three-decade long observational study that started in the 1990s. It reiterates that in the pursuit of truth, time is but a twinkle.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-hole-in-the-middle-the-hindu-editorial-on-2020-physics-nobel/article32797267.ece

364,2020/10/08,When a ‘passenger’ joined mid-air,"Doctor recounts incident of helping woman give birth on flight

When a pregnant woman in her mid-30s felt pain and complained to the cabin crew of Indigo 6E 122 flight Delhi-Bengaluru, little did she know that her baby would be born mid-air.

This was just 15 minutes after the flight took off from Delhi on October 7. When the cabin crew asked if there was a doctor on board, a plastic surgeon Nagaraj attended to her and suspected indigestion.

But as pain did not subside, the crew asked if there was another doctor on board. That was when Sailaja V., a consultant gynaecologist with Cloudnine hospital, rose to help. However, the woman, in a state of restlessness, walked towards the restroom and that was when her water broke.

“I realised she was into labour, and that her pregnancy was at least 32 week old. She was alone and had not seen a doctor before. I sanitised myself, wore the gloves, and started the delivery process. We used whatever we could lay our hands on. After cutting the umbilical cord, I used the gauze as no clamps were available. The premature male baby was born at 6.10 p.m. near Bhopal,” Dr. Sailaja told The Hindu.

“The mother was bleeding and we needed clothes. Passengers came forward to help and we used shawls to wrap the mother and the child. Bags were placed to make an elevated bed on the three-seater row for the mother,” she said adding that it was a great feeling to hold the baby.

Dr. Sailaja said she was happy to have saved two lives and do justice to what she had learnt. “The lady was extremely strong and it was her second baby.” About the response from other passengers, the doctor said, “Passengers were extremely cooperative; they were thrilled, amazed, and fearful. When the pilot announced that there is a new member on board, everyone applauded.”

She said the crew was extremely supportive, and stressed on the need for airlines to train staff to deal with such emergencies. “Airlines should engage with maternity hospitals to train their staff to give basic training, this will help a lot.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/mh1h52/article32807477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGBABY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/when-a-passenger-joined-the-flight-mid-air/article32807478.ece

According to the police, the incident occurred in the afternoon when Nandini stepped out of her house at R.K. Garden on BEL Road to start the car, which was parked in front of a tree.

“Nandini opened the door and started the ignition. The car was in reverse gear and the hand brake was not engaged. It started moving. Before she could do anything, she was dragged along with the open door and got wedged between the car and the tree,” said a police officer.

Passers-by saw her bleeding profusely and raised an alarm for help. Her family members and other residents extricated her. They took her to a private hospital where she was declared as brought dead.

The Sadashivanagar traffic police have taken up a case. “We have obtained CCTV footage and will be recording the statement of her family members,” said a police officer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/woman-dies-after-getting-wedged-between-car-and-tree/article32806711.ece
368,2020/10/08,Committee constituted to come up with action plan for Vrushabhavathi valley,"First up: night patrolling to arrest illegal dumping into the river

After years of neglect, resulting in it being mistaken for a giant sewer, there is finally a plan for the highly polluted Vrushabhavathi river. A committee has been constituted by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to draw up an action plan for the Vrushabhavathi Valley (V-Valley).

The KSPCB memorandum about the committee stated that there is a need to protect and conserve the Vrushabhavathi to “conserve the water source, ensure maintenance of micro climatic conditions, including temperature.”

The committee will be headed by the KSPCB Member Secretary, and will include the president or representative of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI), a waste water engineering expert nominated by the KSPCB Chairman, and Namami Vrushabhavathi Foundation’s Niveditha Sunkad.

Vrushabhavathi Valley is one of the three major valleys in Bengaluru. The river flows south, joining the Arkavathi, a tributary of river Cauvery. The catchment of V-Valley is about 170 sq.km. covering about 90 wards in BBMP, the memorandum said.

“V-Valley generates about 480 MLD of domestic sewage. Most of this is being discharged into the valley either in partially treated form or in untreated form. This has resulted in the pollution of Vrushabhavathi causing problems to the surrounding environment,” it added.

Patrolling vehicles

A KSPCB official said the first decision taken by the committee is the deployment of night patrolling vehicles. Teams of two marshals with vehicles have been deployed between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. to identify culprits discharging effluents and dumping solid waste into the valley and report it to the Board.

Illegal night discharge and dumping has been one of the biggest problems. The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) too has raised the issue. The Hindu had recently reported about coloured water, suspected to be effluents from dyeing industries, being discharged into the lake.

Residents living near the river said the next priority of the committee should be to look at polluting industries.

“They need to identify polluters and bring in solutions instead of penalising them. From Hosakerehalli side and from Uttarahalli side, there are a lot of dyeing industries that are discharging effluents into the lake,” said a resident.

Ms. Sunkad, who is on the committee, said constitution of the committee was a first step. “Solutions are there. It is just that the KSPCB has to do the bridging between solutions and industries,” she said.

But questions are being raised about the composition of the committee. Some point out that external expertise comes in the form of an ‘invitee wastewater management expert’, and that there are no external scientists in the committee.

Sharachchandra Lele, Distinguished Fellow in Environmental Policy and Governance of Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology, which has carried out studies on the river, said it is important for the committee to understand the problem thoroughly – both about the industrial and the domestic pollution – by consulting those who have researched the river.

“They should hold a public hearing process to determine what should be the use and therefore what should be the water quality goal for the river, how domestic sewage will be tackled because the main problem lies in lack of connectivity with the sewer system or lack of STPs, and determine the main roadblocks to controlling industrial pollution. They should involve the polluting industries as well as common citizens in solving the problem,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/wqhnkj/article32806682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGVRISHABHAVATHIP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/committee-constituted-to-come-up-with-action-plan-for-vrushabhavathi-valley/article32806683.ece
369,2020/10/08,Increase in birds injured by banned kite strings,"The number has gone up from 45 in May to 232 in September, says ARRC

An increasing number of citizens are taking to kite flying, especially over the last few weeks after restrictions were eased, and this is reflected in the number of bird rescue calls that animal and avian welfare organisations are receiving.

BBMP wardens rescued around 150 birds in September.

According to Avian and Reptile Rehabilitation Centre (ARRC) in Horamavu, there has been a significant increase in the number of rescue of birds entangled in manja and other strings made of nylon, plastic or synthetic threads since May. While the team rescued 45 birds in May this year, the number went up to 73 in June, 102 in July, 247 in August and 232 in September.

As many as 65 birds were rescued in January by ARRC followed by 46 in February and 27 each in March and April.

Jayanthi Kallam, executive director, ARRC, said that these days they are receiving seven to eight calls a day. “It is very unusual for this time of the year. We had a total of 354 manja rescues in 2019. This year, with three months to spare, we have had around 900 cases,” she said.

She added that the figures only represented rescue cases involving the Centre. “The number of birds injured due to people flying kites is definitely higher as there are many other organisations that are involved in such rescues. And there’s the fact that many cases go unreported,” she said.

Ban has not been effective

Activists and experts say that the ban has been ineffective as manja and other strings made of nylon and plastic are still available in the city. A senior official from the Forest Department of the BBMP acknowledged that the rescue calls they were getting were “unusually high” and that they would take action.

Rajesh Kumar, chief wildlife warden, urged people flying kites to use cotton thread and report the sale of manja and banned material to the authorities. “The government should take strict action against the production, transportation, storage and distribution of such banned strings. Only then can the problem be solved,” he said.

Arun Prasad, an animal rights activist, called for a more effective and sustained implementation of the ban on the manufacture and sale of manja and nylon threads. “They are non-biodegradable. There is a need to create awareness. Those who are aware of the ban do not know how to identify the banned strings,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ezw9cn/article32806507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGCROWP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/increase-in-birds-injured-by-banned-kite-strings/article32806508.ece
370,2020/10/08,High Court stays BDA Commissioner’s order telling staff not to attend ACB inquiries,"The order had been issued on July 8

The Karnataka High Court on Thursday stayed the order of the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) to its officers and staff not to participate in any inquiry being conducted by agencies like the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) and the Bangalore Metropolitan Task Force (BMTF) or hand over any official document to these agencies without the Commissioner’s prior permission.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the interim order on a PIL petition filed by S. Arunachalam, a resident of Amruthnagar.

The BDA Commissioner had issued these instructions in his communication dated July 8, 2020.

Pointing out that no provision of any law has been referred by the Commissioner to exercise the power to issue such a direction, the bench said that prima facie, the Commissioner’s decision interferes in investigation conducted by agencies like the ACB and the BMTF.

Observing that the BDA Commissioner, prima facie has no power to interfere in the investigation conducted by these agencies, the bench cautioned the BDA of serious action if no law officer represented the authority during next date of hearing on November 10 as the BDA has not responded to the court’s notice and queries made during the hearing on September 22.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/3zfpaq/article32809862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hc-stays-bda-commissioners-order-telling-staff-not-to-attend-acb-inquiries/article32806104.ece
371,2020/10/08,Police crack the whip on traffic offenders,"No fitness certificate until dues are paid

Motorists with traffic violation dues will not find it easy to get fitness certificates for their vehicles. In an attempt to crack down on offenders, RTOs have been directed not to issue certificates to motorists.

A senior official with the Transport Department said, “The rule was being practised by the RTOs even earlier. However with fresh directions, it will be enforced strictly. Fitness certificates will not be issued until the vehicle owner clears all the dues and gets an NOC from the traffic police.”

An order was issued to RTOs on September 30.

According to the traffic police, around ₹100 crore in dues are yet to come in from cases that were booked through contactless enforcement, which was started due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Despite the traffic department issuing notices to owners to clear their fines, they have failed to pay them,” said a traffic police official.

The traffic department has earlier issued notices to offenders, a majority of whom drove commercial vehicles, but they failed to respond.

According to Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Traffic East M. Narayan, ₹228 crore is due from motorists since last one year.

“Traffic violations are on the rise due to contactless enforcement and the limited presence of traffic police on the roads during the lockdown. As a result, traffic sense and discipline among the motorists disappeared,” said Mr. Narayan. “The transport and traffic departments are concerned. In order to bring back discipline, strict enforcement will be back and and recovery of dues is one among the several measures taken up,” Mr. Narayan, said.

The matter was reportedly brought to the attention of the Chief Secretary at a recent review meeting. “Directions have been given to the Transport Department to coordinate with the traffic police to recover the dues,” said another police official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-crack-the-whip-on-traffic-offenders/article32805940.ece

373,2020/10/08,"At a Chennai Corporation primary school, the walls bring alive Metro Rail","While deciding to paint the building, the school in Anna Sivagami Nagar decided to paint the façade like a train, to make it exciting for the children when they return

Children studying at the Chennai Corporation Primary School in Annai Sivagami Nagar, Ennore have an artistic school building to come back to, when the Tamil Nadu government decides to reopen schools.

While they were deciding on carrying out regular maintenance and painting work for the school building, headmistress T. Vetriselvi said a teacher at the school, S. Vasugi, came up with an idea. “For a while now, she has been telling us we could paint the walls of the school building in a unique way, which is when the suggestion of painting it like a train came up,” Ms. Vetriselvi said.

On further discussion, the headmistress said they decided to go with the design of a Metro rail coach. “Children love travelling by train and as adults too, we often end up making friends on these journeys. Journeys usually evoke pleasant memories, and when the children come back to school after the COVID-19 break, we want them to be happy and excited,” she said.

The façade of the school has been painted like a Metro train, and a compound wall near the building has been painted to look like a station, with people walking on the platform. The mural has been done in such a way that the school doors are the doors of the train coach.

Sathya, who is among the painters involved in this project, said that they were happy to transform the school this way, for the children.

Apart from the building façade, the classrooms walls too have been painted with cartoon characters as well as educational content such as the solar system, English words for better communication and letters and numbers for the younger children.

The school has a student strength of around 300, from classes LKG to five.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/s1nxi2/article32803067.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08OCTTH--CORPN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/at-a-chennai-corporation-primary-school-the-walls-bring-alive-metro-rail/article32803068.ece
374,2020/10/08,Chennai Corporation to hold additional fever camps every evening,"The goal is to bring down the percentage of COVID-19 positive cases, said Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan

The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will organise additional fever camps from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. to cover more residents of the city. At present, the civic body conducts over 500 camps per day during the day.

Principal Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, participating in a health camp at NSK Nagar in Anna Nagar, said that as more positivity rates are prevailing in some GCC zones, more fever camps would be held to bring down the percentage of the COVID-19 positive cases. He said health camps would be held near offices from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. and in residential areas between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.

Second sero-survey

Mr. Radhakrishnan said a second sero-survey is proposed to be conducted by the civic body in low-income areas, selecting random streets, to ascertain the immunity level of persons who were previously affected by COVID-19.

GCC Commissioner G. Prakash pointed out the positive features of organising such fever camps in identifying symptomatic patients and also in preventing other diseases. He said the intensive fever camps would be held continuously for another three to four months and advised residents not to let down their guard against the virus. People must wear masks and adhere to safety protocols in work spaces, he said.

Testing rate trebled

Mr. Prakash said based on the directions of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, the testing rate was trebled from the second week of June, with more than 16 lakh persons tested for COVID-19, which in percentage terms, is 20%. He said Chennai is the first city in the country to cover 20% of the total city population. He was confident that if this testing rate continued, the positivity rate could be brought down to 5%.

Mr. Prakash pointed out that by organising intensive fever camps and strict quarantine rules, the doubling time of cases in the city stands at 93 days though the Indian Council of Medical Research has set the doubling standard at 14 days.

According to figures released by the civic body 56,904 fever clinics were conducted from May 5 (when the first fever camp was organised) until Wednesday. A total of 28.93 lakh people attended the clinics with 1.68 lakh symptomatic patients identified for COVID-19.

Thiru Vi Ka Nagar zone witnessed the highest number of 3,23,970 persons visiting the 5,356 camps while Teynampet, by holding close to 6,000 camps saw 3,12,435 persons participating. The total positive cases detected through the fever camps stood at 26,034 (16%) out of 1,66,253 influenza like illness (ILI) cases detected.

A senior official of the health department of the civic body said though the average number of persons attending the fever camps now stands at 51, during the lockdown period, the footfalls were in the range of 70 to 80 persons per camp. He said the unlocking of offices and commercial establishments has resulted in the number of persons visiting the camps coming down, as many people have to go to their workplaces.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fnpqqv/article32802563.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08OCTTH--FEVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-corporation-to-hold-additional-fever-camps-every-evening/article32802564.ece
375,2020/10/08,TN police arrest promoters of DHFL for cheating depositors,"A case has been registered against Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan for the alleged offences of defrauding investors’ money by floating bogus schemes, and the non-repayment of ₹218 crore of deposits collected

The Economic Offences Wing of the Tamil Nadu Police has arrested the promoters of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL), Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan, in connection with a major financial fraud.

According to police, a case was registered by the Economic Offences Wing on the direction of the Madras High Court, against DHFL and 11 others, for the alleged offences of defrauding the money of investors by floating bogus schemes, and the non-repayment of ₹218 crore of deposits collected. Investors cheated by DHFL have been requested to lodge complaints with the Economic Offences Wing.

The accused, Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan, were produced by the Economic Offences Wing before the Special Court for cases under the TNPID Act in Chennai on Wednesday, for judicial remand.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) had previously arrested the Wadhawans, who were accused of money laundering in the Yes Bank scam. Between April 2018 and June 2018, Yes Bank invested ₹3,700 crore in short-term debentures in scam-hit DHFL. In return, the Wadhawans allegedly paid kickbacks of ₹600 crore to the former Yes Bank CEO Rana Kapoor and his family members, seeking to pass them off as loans.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/k261y9/article32801198.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/wadhwansJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tn-police-arrest-promoters-of-dhfl-for-cheating-depositors/article32801212.ece
376,2020/10/08,Madras High Court reiterates its order to demolish four bungalows close to ECR,"The court however, directed the government authorities to wait for a month before carrying out the demolition, so that the owners could exhaust other remedies available to them under the law

The Madras High Court has reiterated an order passed by it on August 14 to demolish four bungalows constructed within 200 metres of the high tide line of the Bay of Bengal along East Coast Road, in Muttukadu near here, which are in violation of Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ) regulations.

A Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy, however, directed the government authorities concerned to wait for a month before carrying out the demolition so that the owners of those bungalows could exhaust other remedies available to them under the law.

The Bench dismissed clarificatory petitions filed on behalf of the owners and agreed with Special Government Pleader (SGP) E. Manoharan that the area of 200 metres from the high tide line had been declared a ‘no development zone’ through a 2011 CRZ notification.

On August 14, the judges had ordered the demolition of the bungalows while dismissing individual writ petitions filed by the owners challenging notices affixed by the government authorities on the properties, declaring them to be illegal constructions.

The court concurred with the SGP that the local panchayat had no right to grant building plan permission for a construction in the no development zone. It also took note that notices were issued to the petitioners way back in 2012, but no coercive action was taken after that.

The issue gained momentum only after one Murugan filed a public interest litigation petition in 2018, to demolish all the buildings constructed close to the coast. The Bench had passed common orders on the PIL petition as well as on individual writ petitions.

Hence, the bungalow owners had filed the present clarificatory petitions contending that they were not parties to the PIL petition.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/madras-high-court-reiterates-its-order-to-demolish-four-bungalows-close-to-ecr/article32800569.ece

The Consulate-General of the Republic of Korea will host a webinar on “Current economic issues in India” in collaboration with the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) on Thursday.

In the webinar, economic experts will present on the current and future economic trends in India and extensive range of topics, including changes in Indian tax norms, custom clearance, duty policy and exchange rates after COVID-19 pandemic and Tamil Nadu’s latest incentive programme, according to an official release.

Around 100 company representatives will participate in the webinar chaired by Consul General Young-seup Kwon in Tamil Nadu.

Approximately 150 Korean companies, mostly Hyundai Motors, Samsung Electronics and their vendors employ 3 lakh people, thereby leading to job creation of 1.5 million jobs in Tamil Nadu indirectly, the statement said.

Deputy Consul General Hong Yup Lee said the webinar would be timely and ideal as many Korean investors were looking for sites for their factories shifting out of China and other countries for various reasons.

Mr. Lee hoped that Tamil Nadu and its people would continue to build a business-friendly environment for the Korean companies and expats to bring more potential Korean investments into the State. For example, he said allowing import of food ingredients specific to Korean cuisine will make the daily life of Korean expats easier, making it easier for Korean companies, which were a bit reluctant to relocate to India.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/korean-envoy-to-host-webinar-today/article32798336.ece

Guidance, the Tamil Nadu government’s nodal agency for investment promotion and single window facilitation, has partnered with the World Economic Forum (WEF) to establish India’s first advanced manufacturing hub (AMHUB) in Tamil Nadu.

The State will be able to harness opportunities in electronics, electric mobility, solar energy and textiles through collaboration with the AMHUB.

“As an important contributor to the manufacturing sector in India, Tamil Nadu will utilise the AMHUB to adopt IoT [Internet of Things] and other emerging technologies for advanced manufacturing to sustain and create new avenues of manufacturing growth,” said Neeraj Mittal, CEO and Managing Director of Guidance. “Advanced manufacturing will boost end-to-end manufacturing of high-tech and high-value products in Tamil Nadu and will shape the future of advanced manufacturing and production,” he said.

The AMHUB is one of the 19 platforms designed by the WEF. The hub will help the production ecosystem in Tamil Nadu by identifying and addressing regional opportunities brought about by the fourth industrial revolution, highlighting and amplifying regional success stories globally and engaging directly with other AMHUBs through the WEF’s network. According to Guidance, in the area of workforce up-skilling/re-skilling, it will help in identifying gaps in skills and bridge them from global experience.

Tamil Nadu will be able to promote sustainable manufacturing by adopting new models of collaboration to scale sustainable solutions in manufacturing that will facilitate circular economy transition and accelerate towards a carbon-neutral manufacturing industry.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/guidance-partners-wef-to-open-manufacturing-hub/article32798279.ece
381,2020/10/08,HC orders crackdown on packaged water units,"Govt. asked to charge for groundwater

The Madras High Court on Wednesday directed the State government to crack down on all illegal packaged drinking water units across the State. It wanted criminal cases to be booked against those who were tapping groundwater and exploiting it commercially without obtaining no objection certificates (NoCs) from the officials concerned.

Justices Vineet Kothari and M.S. Ramesh also directed the government to take a policy decision, within four weeks, on levying appropriate charges on such commercial units for the extraction of groundwater. They directed Special Government Pleader (SGP) J. Pothiraj to ascertain the government’s decision in this regard by November 19.

Earlier, the Bench recorded the SGP’s statement that the survey of groundwater level across the State was being taken once in three years and that those areas were classified as safe, semi-critical, critical and over-exploited on the basis of their groundwater level. NoCs were issued on the basis of such classifications. Since the last survey was done in 2017, the government authorities had begun a resurvey this year and had already completed assessing the over-exploited areas. The resurvey of safe, semi-critical and critical areas would be completed by March 2021, and thereafter NoCs would be issued, the SGP said.

The submission was made when the counsel, representing some packaged drinking water units, complained that the denial of NoCs on the basis of the 2017 survey was not right since many areas that were classified as critical then would now fall under semi-critical category due to copious rain and the consequent increase in the groundwater table.

Though the counsel also claimed that the business carried out by packaged drinking water units could not be treated as illegal since they were only assisting the government in fulfilling drinking water requirements of the citizens, the judges refused to buy such an argument and held that illegal units could not be allowed to run.

COVID-19 threat

The court also recalled an order passed by it in March, when the threat of COVID-19 was at its peak, permitting certain units without NOCs to function since there should not be a sudden dearth for water during the pandemic. Now the situation had improved and there was no necessity to show any such indulgence, it said.

In his submissions, the SGP informed the court that originally 1,086 illegal packaged drinking water units were identified across the State and of them, 396 were found to be in critical and over-exploited areas. The government closed down all the illegal units in critical and over-exploited areas and invited applications for NOCs from the others.

Out of the remaining 690 units, 510 were granted NOCs on the basis of a condition imposed by the court that those units should supply 15% of the water extracted by them to the district administration concerned so that the water could be provided free of cost to the people who could not afford to pay for safe drinking water.

However, as many as 367 units did not comply with the court-imposed condition and failed to supply 15% of water to the district administration, the SGP told the court. He also undertook to submit a list of those units during the next hearing of the case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-orders-crackdown-on-packaged-water-units/article32798278.ece

The meeting, chaired by Commissioner G. Prakash, was attended by senior officials from Greater Chennai Police, State Highways, CMWSSB, Tangedco, Southern Railway and Revenue department.

According to a press release, the number of localities prone to water stagnation had been brought down to only three from 306 in 2015, 205 in 2017, 53 in 2018 and 19 in 2019.

As part of the efforts to prevent water stagnation, the civic body had taken up clearing of 30 canals, including those belonging to the Public Works Department, at a cost of ₹15 crore using modern machinery such as robotic excavators and mini amphibians.

The Corporation had set up a 24-hour control room with 75 staff members to receive complaints of water stagnation, traffic disruption due to tree fall and overflowing of sewage. Heavy duty pumps have been kept at standby to pump out water from 16 subways maintained by the civic body and mechanised tree-cutting machinery are kept ready to clear debris to ensure smooth movement of traffic.

The civic body would be cleaning the stormwater drain maintained by the State Highways department and Southern Railway.

At the meeting, the civic body made clear that permission would not be given for road cutting during the monsoon and advised utilities, including Tangedco, the CMWSSB and telecom companies to speed up in completing all the civic infrastructure development of any underground cable laying work.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5y1l2l/article32798246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THMONSOON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corpn-ready-for-rains/article32798247.ece
384,2020/10/08,Growing canine strength worries citizens,"Many attribute it to disruption in the animal birth control programme

Residents in the suburbs of the city are concerned over the rising number of community dogs. They blame it on disruption in the implementation of the animal birth control programme.

M. Harish, a resident of Ambattur, said there were 200 to 300 dogs on the streets of Vijayalakshmipuram and small children playing on the streets were scared to venture out of their homes because of this.

He wanted the officials of the Ambattur zone of the Greater Chennai Corporation to take steps to take away these stray dogs. Social activist V. Santhanam attributed the rise in the number of community dogs to the COVID-19 lockdown.

He rued that the Pallavaram Municipality had stopped the animal birth control programme.

A number of animals injured in dog fights were roaming the streets with little help coming from the local authorities or any non-governmental organisations.

A senior official of the Corporation said the animal birth control was being implemented at all the three centres at Pulianthope, Kannammapet and Lloyds Colony, with more than 70 to 80 dogs being rounded up daily based on complaints from citizens. He said the civic body had taken steps to control the number of community dogs even during lockdown.

Vinodkumar of the Blue Cross of India said although they had closed the Outpatient ward for treating pets, an exclusive WhatsApp number had been opened for the public to reach them for rescuing and treating any wounded stray animal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/6crqts/article32798229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THDOGS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/growing-canine-strength-worries-citizens/article32798230.ece
385,2020/10/08,Air passenger traffic showing signs of revival,"AAI is hopeful that Chennai airport will soon receive 200 flights a day

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) had to wait for a long time before its request for operating 100 arrival flights from other States was approved. Finally, the announcement came last week, much to its relief. But there has been only a marginal increase in the flight movements so far.

For instance, there were only 58 arrival and 58 departure flights on Tuesday and 64 arrival and 64 departure flights on Wednesday.

The AAI is hopeful that in a week’s time the numbers would touch 200 flights, both arrival and departures, sources said. One of the primary reasons for this, there has been no uptick in the demand for seats, sources said.

“We don’t see tourists or the entire section of business travellers back to taking flights yet. Gradually, there are people willing to travel but it is going to take time because many of them still have apprehensions,” a source said.

There has been an incremental rise in the number of passengers but it was far from pre-COVID-19 level.

Right now, there are about 12,000-13,000 passengers a day travelling but early this year, the airport handled about 35,000 passengers a day with nearly 450-500 flight movements.

Low occupancy

Sources said, in some flights, the number of passengers is still dismal. Every day, in some flights, there are only about 15 to 20 passengers. A few days ago, in a flight to Tiruchi, there were six passengers in all. But officials of the AAI said it was up to to them to fix the schedules and logistics.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/2obwr4/article32798156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THCHENNAIAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/air-passenger-traffic-showing-signs-of-revival/article32798157.ece
386,2020/10/08,Playing catch up in flood forecasting technology,"India needs a technically capable workforce that can master ensemble weather and flood forecast models

Have you ever wondered how a local agency makes a decision if a flood forecast merely uses the words “Rising” or “Falling” above a water level at a river point? Especially when the time available to act is just 24 hours, there is no idea of the area of inundation, its depth, and when the accuracy of the forecast decreases at 24 hours and beyond?

There are many times this happens in India during flood events, when the end users (district administration, municipalities and disaster management authorities) receive such forecasts and have to act quickly. These compelling scenarios are often experienced across most flood forecast river points, examples readers will be familiar with — in Assam, Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala or Tamil Nadu.

Also read | Unhappy with IMD, Kerala tests private forecasts

Compare this with another form of flood forecast (known as the “Ensemble forecast”) that provides a lead time of 7-10 days ahead, with probabilities assigned to different scenarios of water levels and regions of inundation. An example of the probabilities ahead could be something like this: chances of the water level exceeding the danger level is 80%, with likely inundation of a village nearby at 20%. The “Ensemble flood forecast” certainly helps local administrations with better decision-making and in being better prepared than in a deterministic flood forecast.

The United States, the European Union and Japan have already shifted towards “Ensemble flood forecasting” alongwith “Inundation modelling”. India has only recently shifted towards “Deterministic forecast” (i.e. “Rising” or “Falling” type forecast per model run).

The shortcomings with Indian flood forecasting are glaring.

Editorial | Monsoon bounty: On IMD's weather forecasts

A case of multiple agencies

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issues meteorological or weather forecasts while the Central Water Commission (CWC) issues flood forecasts at various river points. The end-user agencies are disaster management authorities and local administrations.

Therefore, the advancement of flood forecasting depends on how quickly rainfall is estimated and forecast by the IMD and how quickly the CWC integrates the rainfall forecast (also known as Quantitative Precipitation Forecast or QPF) with flood forecast. It also is linked to how fast the CWC disseminates this data to end user agencies.

Thus, the length of time from issuance of the forecast and occurrence of a flood event termed as “lead time” is the most crucial aspect of any flood forecast to enable risk-based decision-making and undertake cost-effective rescue missions by end user agencies.

Technology plays a part in increasing lead time. Reports suggest that the IMD has about 35 advanced Doppler weather radars to help it with weather forecasting. Compared to point scale rainfall data from rain gauges, Doppler weather radars can measure the likely rainfall directly (known as Quantitative Precipitation Estimation or QPE) from the cloud reflectivity over a large area; thus the lead time can be extended by up to three days.

But the advantage of advanced technology becomes infructuous because most flood forecasts at several river points across India are based on outdated statistical methods (of the type gauge-to-gauge correlation and multiple coaxial correlations) that enable a lead time of less than 24 hours. This is contrary to the perception that India’s flood forecast is driven by Google’s most advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques!

These statistical methods fail to capture the hydrological response of river basins between a base station and a forecast station. They cannot be coupled with QPF too.

Google AI has adopted the hydrological data and forecast models derived for diverse river basins across the world for training AI to issue flood alerts in India. This bypasses the data deficiencies and shortcomings of forecasts based on statistical methods.

Also read | IMD begins impact-based forecast

Not uniform across India

A study by the National Institute of Technology, Warangal, Telangana shows that it is only recently that India has moved to using hydrological (or simply rainfall-runoff models) capable of being coupled with QPF. So, a lead time of three days is sporadic in India, and at select river points.

Just as the CWC’s technological gap limits the IMD’s technological advancement, the technological limitations of the IMD can also render any advanced infrastructure deployed by CWC infructuous. Here is another example. The United States which is estimated to have a land area thrice that of India, has about 160 next generation S-band Doppler weather radars (NEXRAD) with a range of 250-300 km. India will need at least an 80-100 S-band dense radar network to cover its entire territory for accurate QPF. Else, the limitations of altitude, range, band, density of radars and its extensive maintenance enlarge the forecast error in QPF which would ultimately reflect in the CWC’s flood forecast. Conspicuously, the error margin is always away from the public gaze.

Therefore, outdated technologies and a lack of technological parity between multiple agencies and their poor water governance decrease crucial lead time. Forecasting errors increase and the burden of interpretation shifts to hapless end user agencies. The outcome is an increase in flood risk and disaster.

The Hindu Explains | Why are monsoons difficult to predict?

Ensemble technology

Global weather phenomenon is chaotic. For instance theoretically, “the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Chennai can create a Tornado in Tokyo” according to MIT’s Edward Lorenz. In simple terms and scientifically, any small change in the initial conditions of a weather model results in an output that is completely unexpected. Therefore, beyond a lead time of three days, a deterministic forecast becomes less accurate.

The developed world has shifted from deterministic forecasting towards ensemble weather models that measure uncertainty by causing perturbations in initial conditions, reflecting the different states of the chaotic atmosphere. Probabilities are then computed for different flood events, with a lead time beyond 10 days.

India has a long way to go before mastering ensemble model-based flood forecasting.

Although, the IMD has begun testing and using ensemble models for weather forecast through its 6.8 peta flops supercomputers (“Pratyush” and “Mihir”), the forecasting agency has still to catch up with advanced technology and achieve technological parity with the IMD in order to couple ensemble forecasts to its hydrological models. It has to modernise not only the telemetry infrastructure but also raise technological compatibility with river basin-specific hydrological, hydrodynamic and inundation modelling. To meet that objective, it needs a technically capable workforce that is well versed with ensemble models and capable of coupling the same with flood forecast models. It is only then that India can look forward to probabilistic-based flood forecasts with a lead time of more than seven to 10 days and which will place it on par with the developed world.

With integration between multiple flood forecasting agencies, end user agencies can receive probabilistic forecasts that will give them ample time to decide, react, prepare and undertake risk-based analysis and cost-effective rescue missions, reducing flood hazard across the length and breadth of India.

387,2020/10/08,Using facts to hide underlying truths,"In the clever use of seemingly appropriate words and phrases by the powerful, one finds a clear intent to deceive people

The Hathras atrocity is weighing on the national conscience, or whatever is left of it. People have witnessed not just the most brutal face of social oppression, but a cynical and brazen use of the state machinery to support the oppressors. The inhuman assault of the teenage Dalit girl — I shall call her Bharati — that eventually killed her was followed by a hesitation in filing the first information report, the callous and deferred medical examination, the neglect of the dying declaration, and, most alarmingly, the haste in burning the body by the police without appropriate rites or the presence of family members.

This wilful destruction of evidence was followed by political tyranny: family members were virtually put under house arrest, the entire village was barricaded by massive police force, Opposition leaders and mediapersons who tried to reach the victim’s family were stopped and roughed up — an appalling instance of dictatorial behaviour that made a mockery of our constitutional democracy.

Also read | Journalist and three others, arrested on their way to Hathras, booked for sedition in U.P.

Shaping the discourse

I shall not, however, focus on any of these, attending instead to the slippery speech-acts of spokespersons of the ruling party as they tried to shape the discourse around the horrific incident. Using false arguments to deceive the listener is a common form of sophistry. But what was heard here was the use of true statements to hide other more urgent and relevant truths. This is no ordinary fake news or misinformation but the clever use of seemingly appropriate words and phrases with the clear intention of deceiving the populace. Few better instances are available of how facts and truth are used to generate a false discourse.

I illustrate my point with three examples. Take first the issue of mis-description. I heard it being said on a television channel that ‘I was pained at the death of the young woman’. On the face of it, it sounds sensitive and apt; it is true after all that Bharati died. And expression of pain at the loss of life seems fitting. But is it? Since it is incontrovertibly true that she was mercilessly pulverised and eventually killed, the term ‘died’ is entirely inappropriate. ‘Death’ fails to distinguish the demise of a person by natural causes, accident, suicide or murder.

To speak of the death of a person when she was murdered is grossly misleading. If used persistently and deliberately it is nothing but unforgivable sophistry. It obfuscates truth. Likewise, pain alone is not an appropriate emotion in the face of a brutal murder. To not have feelings of anger, horror, or outrage indicates an emotional and moral disability. Overall then, expressing pain at Bharati’s ghastly murder is an inadequate emotion accompanying a gross mis-description. Together, they hide the truth of the gruesome incident. In human situations, finding just the right, the most appropriate description of what has occurred is often the difference between Truth and Falsehood.

Irrelevant explanations

Such mis-descriptions are not the only way in which powerful wrongdoers distort public discourse and evade responsibility. Very often, explanations that are otherwise factually correct or true are equally damaging. So, what is to be made of explanations of the chilling assault on Bharati by reference to the male propensity for aggression, violence and control?

Consider the following example. An investigating police officer enters a charred house, and finds a can of kerosene and a used matchstick. As he exits, a reporter asks how the house caught fire. The officer answers “because of the presence of oxygen at the location”. Now, this account is not untrue, for nothing catches fire without the presence of oxygen. However, the response is entirely irrelevant and would send the news reporter into a tizzy. The answer is wrong because a good explanation needs to be not merely factually correct but relevant to the question at hand.

Surely, at the back of the reporter’s mind is whether the house was burnt accidentally or intentionally and if the latter, precisely who caused it and why. Finding the motive and attributing responsibility for the criminal act is vital. Likewise, it is probably true that males are prone to aggression. Yet, like oxygen, this is part of the standing conditions of specific acts of rape and murder. It is not explanatorily relevant in most cases of actual violence such as in Hathras. If our interest is in finding precipitating causes for why Bharati was assaulted, we need to identify local social, economic, cultural, perhaps political factors. To provide irrelevant and general statements instead is a straightforward ploy to hide the truth, to cover up a possible crime. Likewise, broadening the discussion in the immediate aftermath of the atrocity by speaking generally about rapes all over the country deflects from the specific atrocity in Hathras and lets its perpetrators get off the hook.

Also read | Supreme Court says it’ll ensure smooth probe into Hathras

Identity of the victim

This brings me to the third point which is so obvious that I am surprised that I need to make it at all. To say that Bharati was assaulted and murdered and stop there is being both economical with the truth and morally callous. The omission of a detail withholds the most crucial feature of the story, one without which what happened cannot be understood and explained. Horrendous as all rapes are, it was not just any woman who was brutalised by some men, but a Dalit who was sexually assaulted and killed by ‘upper caste’ men. This crime would likely not have occurred if it was not for Bharati’s Dalit identity. Indeed, she was reportedly gang raped and murderously beaten not only because she was a Dalit but precisely because in the past, her family had resisted ‘upper caste’ domination. Even Bharati did not remain mute as she lay battered, but named her perpetrators in her dying declaration.

So, it is not false to say that a young woman was assaulted and murdered by brutal men, but to ignore Bharati’s Dalit-ness and hide the caste-related nature of the crime is to fail to explain what happened, provide a false account. For it is the criss-crossing co-presence of caste and gender that truly explains what happened to Bharati in Hathras. Ignoring or concealing this falsifies the account, even when no factually incorrect general statement, no outright lie is offered.

Hathras gang rape | NCW summons BJP’s Ranjeet Shrivastava

We cannot paper over the difference between the horrendous act of killing a woman out of personal hatred for what she did, killing her to assert brute male power and murdering her only because of her Dalit identity. In a caste-ridden society, some groups are imprisoned in their castes, facing horrendous consequences simply on account of the family into which they are born, and because of where precisely their family happens to be located in caste hierarchy.

The inadequacies of homilies

Usually the same is true of our religious identity. This is why the targeting of Dalits or Muslims all over India or of Kashmiri Pandits only because of who they are brings in a dimension of violence that cannot be condemned by general homilies such as ‘all killing is horrible’ or that ‘all rapes are terrible’. These true, generalised statements tend then to obliterate the very reason for which some people are killed. To mistreat, discriminate and target individuals because of their colour, gender, religion or nationality is to commit a crime qualitatively different from other horrific acts. For it attacks and terrorises not just one person but her entire community. To omit any mention of these specific group identities where relevant is then to entirely mis-describe the crime and obscure its real cause.

In short, in cases such as the Hathras atrocity where caste and gender oppression are deeply intertwined, one cannot foreground gender in a way that prevents people from seeing the causal role of caste in the violent act. To de-emphasise this point is to falsify the narrative. To place emphasis on just one and not on the other is also to distort the account. This politically motivated sophistry is dangerous. By legitimising the crime, it helps perpetuate it.

The handling of the Hathras assault and murder case is a total failure of our legal and law enforcement systems. From the badgering of the victim’s family to outright denial of the grievous crime, it is a case defined by its incompetence. This blatant miscarriage of justice does not behove a country which seeks to position itself as a world leader. Over the last two years, NCRB data show crimes against women to have risen significantly; the same can be said about crimes against Dalits.

Ever since the unfortunate incident, the Uttar Pradesh government has only been trying to hush up the issue with various theories. Every development seems to have political patronage. Instead of protecting the life, liberty and dignity of the downtrodden and the vulnerable, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is only exploring ways to divert attention from the government’s failures. When will the conscience of the Chief Minister be reflected?

Instead of playing its role swiftly, effectively and honestly by being benign and empathetic to the family of the victim, the political and administrative apparatus of the State is stooping low, creating the perception that it is shielding the accused, suppressing evidence and stifling rightful demands for justice for the victim. It is disgusting to note that there are political attempts to rally support in favour of the accused. One hopes that the judiciary will be firm and deliver justice (Page 1, “Will ensure smooth probe into Hathras gang rape”, October 7)

N. Raveendra Babu,

The fact that the Supreme Court has now stepped in gives us some hope that justice will be ensured (Page 1, “Will ensure smooth probe into Hathras gang rape, says SC”, October 7). The top court must make it clear that it will enforce strict and personal supervision of the investigations, given the U.P. government’s track record in the Unnao case. When such atrocities are happening in a BJP-ruled State, it is perplexing that the Prime Minister is still quiet.

Science and research

Zeal about science and harnessing it for human welfare primarily led the great work on the (hepatitis) viruses in the 1970s, and the subject of the Medicine Nobel now. The illness was serious but did not cripple society like this new virus has done now. There was no pressure on time to get at the basic science first and then go on to create effective vaccines and medicines. Science and human welfare are still the considerations, but when it comes to vaccines and new treatment protocols, commercial success as well politics of nations seem to drive the actual story today. Science will ultimately come to our aid, but it is now an issue of society; commerce needs to take a back seat. There is no purpose in developing drugs that will cost thousands of dollars per course. International science has unravelled this virus considerably and continues to do so. There seems to be considerable scope in exploring old and repurposed drugs to fight this virus and successfully too. Commercial considerations would not be fascinated by such a prospect. Society looks up to science for fast help. And the science, if it succeeds, would be worth a Noble Prize.

390,2020/10/08,How snack balls have become trendy alternatives to junk food to munch on,"The good old traditional, nutrient-rich laddus made of sesame, dry fruits and more are back in trend as snack balls, packaged as healthier alternatives for anytime munching

Energy balls, nutri balls, bliss balls, protein balls... a snack ball by any other name tastes as good and packs as much nutrition. The delectable, low-calorie pick-me-ups are also simply convenient — to both make and take — just pop one in while at work or leisure.

Abinas Nayak, winner of Masterchef India Season 6 this year, has fond memories of the rasi laddus (sesame balls) his grandma used to make regularly when he was a kid. “Those days, we used to eat a whole variety of these, like wheat balls and coconut balls with a smattering of amaranth seeds. Though the concept of snack balls always sustained, it is good to see them coming back as healthier alternatives to junk food today,” he says.

Abinas feels they are quite versatile. “You can prepare them with a variety of cereals or millets as base. It’s also nice to have a combination of these or mix and match,” he points out. However, it is not just the easy-to-source traditional ones that he roots for, but also some offbeat varieties. “Perhaps the most exotic bliss balls I have come across were made from a mixture of desiccated berries and an assortment of nuts in Mumbai once,” he remembers.

Praveen Anand, Executive Chef — South Indian cuisines at ITC hotels, says he has noticed more common ones like peanut jaggery balls and sesame jaggery balls finding favour during winter, possibly because, “they are believed to generate heat in the body and give you energy.” He adds, “Adding dates or even making it the base ingredient is great way to cut out sugar. These nutrient-rich additions commonly see now are flax seeds, amaranth seeds, sunflower seeds, water melon seeds, pumpkin seeds and so on. These lend a difference in taste and enhance scope for experimentation.”

Versatility and ease of preparation are also what chef and cookbook author Mallika Badrinath loves about such healthy snack balls. “A variety of cereals and millets commonly available, like ragi, jowar (cholam), fox-tail millet, pearl millet, barnyard millet and so on, that can be used for energy balls. In fact, tasty combinations of these give your new flavours,” she says.

A hack Mallika offers is making use of a candy stick. “You can have them like a lollipop,” she says. Despite all the nutritional boost, she has a word of caution: “It is a salubrious substitute for junk food but our diet has to be supplemented with foods containing Vitamin C, especially at a time like now, when natural immunity has never been so paramount before,” she adds.

Hyderabad-based nutritionist and chef Sridevi Jasti feels our sensory and nutritional needs have changed over time. “Our soil is depleted of its nutrition and consequently our foods have less nutrition. As compensation, we have to look at a broader diet,” she says. Nutri laddus are a popular part of her organic food store Vibrant Living Foods. “For many, snacks are sweets and sweets are snacks. So they should be healthy. One popular item has been coconut berry balls where palm jaggery, which has a lower glycemic index, is used along with soaked almonds and berries. Sometimes, amla powder is also added,” she says. Some other snack balls on offer are carrot laddu, pumpkin laddu and pumpkin and pistachio custard laddu, to suit different palates.

Healthy build

Understandably, energy balls are a hit with gym-hitters. Nutritionist and home chef Priyanka Devika J, who runs The Nurturist based in Thiruvananthapuram, says she often gets enquiries from body-builders for the protein balls. “Such people look for simple food items providing better results. Healthy energy balls rightly fit that bill. It can be deemed a superfood and packs a fair amount if fibre too,” she says.

Some bakers, like Patric Johnson L from Coimbatore, find more takers for the nutri ball versions than dry fruits and nuts per se. His online store ‘The Nut On’ is focussing more on their nut balls. “It comes with dates as base and has roasted almonds, cashew, pista, fig and black-grape raisin. All the ingredients are hand-chopped according to required size to maintain the right proportion,” says Patric. He brings out the energy balls in two varieties — without ghee and with A2 ghee from Indian cow breeds.

Homemade treat

For many, healthy bliss balls are the go-to home-made snack option while steering clear of fried favourites. Some like Priya Ravikrishnan from Thiruvananthapuram, goes the extra mile to make her own health mix that serve as the base for the nutri balls her family loves to munch on.

“Along with my home-prepared multi-grain mix, which packs in 18 nutritious items such as bamboo rice, finger millet, foxtail millet, flaxseed, green gram, horse gram and so on, I add mashed dates, and coarsely powdered almonds, walnuts, cashew, white sesame seeds and a wee bit of honey,” she says. The scope for experimentation is wide, even for those trying at home.

391,2020/10/08,"With a helping hand, rural scholars move closer to realising their dreams","Starting in 2007 with a tie-up with seven Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, Dakshana Foundation has come a long way with 374 students cracking this year’s JEE

Their spirits undeterred by the COVID-19 pandemic, scholars of Dakshana Foundation, which helps bright but economically disadvantaged students from India’s rural hinterland clear some of the country’s toughest entrance exams, have posted their best result yet in this year’s Joint Entrance Exam to engineering colleges.

As many as 374 of the 486 Dakshana scholars who sat for them, cleared the tough test and four have secured category (SC/ST) ranks among top 50 students from the backward communities, according to the Foundation authorities.

“Of the 374, more than 280 are expected to be absorbed by the IITs based on the closing ranks accepted by the IITs in 2019,” said Col. (retd.) Ram Kumar Sharma, chief executive officer (CEO).

To select the best and brightest students from the country’s rural and semi-urban areas, the Foundation, in 2007, began by tying-up with seven Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNV) across the country, including in Rajasthan and Kerala. At Dakshana, students are coached free of cost over a two-year period to crack the IIT and NEET exams.

This year, Dakshana’s topper, Gopal Agrawal, who secured an All-India rank (AIR) of 523, hails from a humble family in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar district.

Gopal’s parents have barely studied up to Class X and run a small shop in the village. His father’s monthly income is less than ₹10,000.

Dakshana's topper Gopal Agrawal (AIR 523), hails from a small village in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar.

“Cracking the IIT has been by single-minded goal since my school days when my teachers urged me to pursue engineering. When I entered the JNV, I understood that engineers are the future of India. Then I heard about the Dakshana Scholarship and made entering that my first goal and IIT my second,” says Gopal, whose boyish smile belies a steely determination.

In 2014, the Foundation established its centre in Pune — its eighth — in a sprawling, 104-acre pastoral idyll flanked by hillocks in Kadus village in Pune’s Khed taluk. Of the 486 scholars, 127 belong to Dakshana’s one-year scholarship program held at the Pune campus, where they were provided free coaching, food and accommodation, to prepare for JEE 2020.

The remaining 359 scholars were part of a two-year scholarship program run jointly with the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti exclusively for JNV students and were prepared at the JNV Bangalore Urban and the JNV Rangareddy in Hyderabad.

According to Col. Sharma, Dakshana’s true success lay in bringing the light of education to thousands of families in the country’s rural hinterland, thereby unfettering them from the shackles of poverty.

“Our young scholars need to study in a suitable environ. Dakshana, with it’s gurukul-like atmosphere of the Pune campus, is providing them with the wherewithal and academic support necessary to crack these difficult exams,” he said.

Lauding the determination of the students, Mohnish Pabrai, founder and chairman, said, “Dakshana’s model of alleviating poverty and unleashing the tremendous untapped talent of rural India has been successful beyond our wildest dreams. However, the best is yet to come as we are just getting started.”

The foundation has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ministry of Education for screening and selecting the most promising JNV students. It also has a partnership with 19 State governments.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ijqkzm/article32807380.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7BMDakshana-Foundation-campus,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/with-a-helping-hand-rural-scholars-move-closer-to-realising-their-dreams/article32807387.ece

393,2020/10/08,VBA backs Oct. 10 shutdown to push for Maratha quota,"Prakash Ambedkar hits out at BJP MPs claiming to represent community’s interests

While stating that the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) would be extending support to the shutdown called by Maratha outfits in the State on October 10, VBA chief Prakash Ambedkar hit out at the two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MPs from the royal families purporting to represent the interests of the Maratha community.

Speaking in Pune, Mr. Ambedkar came down especially hard on Udayanraje Bhosale, the BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP from Satara and direct descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, castigating him as an ‘imbecile’.

Mr. Bhosale had earlier called for all reservation to be abolished if the Maharashtra government failed to ensure implementation of the Maratha quota law in the State — a statement that irked Mr. Ambedkar.

Mr. Ambedkar, the grandson of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, claimed that he had not read anywhere of either Mr. Bhosale or Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje — the BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP from Kolhapur — expressing their support for the shutdown.

Questioning Bhosale

“I wonder how a dolt like MP [Udayanraje Bhosale], who does not understand the Indian Constitution, was sent by the BJP to the Upper House… how can he demand for all reservation to be scrapped if the Maratha quota law does not get implemented in the State?” said the VBA leader.

Expressing his support for the shutdown, Mr. Ambedkar said that community leader Suresh Patil of the Maratha Arakshan Action Samiti had allegedly called him to demand support for their rally on Saturday.

“I have accordingly discussed the issue with my office-bearers and activists. We have decided to extend our support for the shutdown with the understanding that the Maratha community will not demand their quota from the pre-existing reservation for the OBC [Other Backward Classes] community as they are separate things,” said Mr. Ambedkar.

Prakash Ambedkar

Tense atmosphere

The VBA chief further cautioned that given the tense situation prevailing in the State over the Maratha quota issue, there was a distinct possibility that social harmony between the Maratha community and the OBC community could fray if the former insisted on getting their benefits from those already granted to the backward communities.

Mr. Ambedkar’s comments on Mr. Bhosale evoked a predictably furious response from the latter’s supporters, who raised slogans against him in Satara.

“Mr. Ambedkar’s condemnable remarks are an insult to the Chhatrapati’s throne… Maharashtra will not tolerate such regrettable statements,” said the Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra minister, Shamburaj Desai, who is an MLA from Satara.

Mr. Desai said both descendants of Chhatrapati Shivaji had clarified their position on the reservation issue.

‘Unwarranted remarks’

While welcoming the VBA’s support for the shutdown on Saturday, Mr. Patil said that Mr. Ambedkar’s remarks concerning Mr. Bhosale were “regrettable” and utterly unwarranted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/khqvmu/article32807358.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8BMSOLAPUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vba-backs-oct-10-shutdown-to-push-for-maratha-quota/article32807359.ece
394,2020/10/08,IPL betting gang busted; 11 arrested,"Police in pursuit of over five bookies

The Local Crime Branch (LCB) of the Raigad police has busted a gang of 11 bookies who placed bets on matches in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL), which kicked off on September 19 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

On October 1, acting on a tip-off, police inspector Jamil Shaikh from the LCB raided a room in 007 Universe Resort at Khandpe in Karjat. The police found Kanti Karamsibhai Varsungiya (43), a resident of Kopri in Thane, and Prakash Popat Pujari (42), a resident of Mulund, placing bets on a match between Kings XI Punjab and Mumbai Indians. The police seized five mobile phones.

During interrogation, the accused revealed that they used various mobile applications to place bets. They divulged the details of 20 mobile IDs, of which four were used for betting. The SIM card used by the accused was also registered in the name of someone else, the police said. “During the course of our investigations, we found that their modus operandi involved the main bookie creating 10 IDs using a super mastercard and distributing them to 10 other bookies. These bookies then use their mastercards to create 10 other IDs, which are given to gamblers, mostly based in UAE. The 10 bookies finalise the betting amount and then pass the information to the main bookie. Every Monday, they would calculate the loss and profit margin. Each mastercard had a limit on the money that could be spent based on the game and the bookie,” Mr. Shaikh said.

The police then went on to arrest nine more bookies from Mumbai and Thane. “The main bookie is yet to be arrested. More than five bookies are wanted and based in Gujarat, Bengaluru and Dubai. Two teams have been sent to Bengaluru and Gujarat to trace them,” Additional Superintendent of Police Sachin Gunjal said.

The accused have been arrested on charges of cheating and forgery under sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Maharashtra Prevention of Gambling Act, the Indian Telegraph Act and the IT Act. The accused have been remanded in police custody till Sunday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4702zh/article32807321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8BMIPL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ipl-betting-gang-busted-11-arrested/article32807322.ece

The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MDRDC) on Thursday said the Samruddhi Expressway, connecting Mumbai to Nagpur, will be opened for traffic on May 1, 2022.

Radheshyam Mopalwar, managing director of MSRDC, said construction of 152.17 km of the 701-km-long expressway has been completed. He said, “The 520-km stretch between Nagpur and Shirdi will be thrown open for vehicular movement on May 1, 2021. Further extension of the stretch to Bhiwandi, which will take the road’s length to 623 km, will be completed by December 1, 2021. The entire expressway will be ready for use from May 1, 2022.”

Mr. Mopalwar said of the ₹55,332 crore construction cost, ₹40,000 crore will be for carrying out engineering work. He said the development plan is ready for eight of the 19 townships that will come up along the e-way.

“Land acquisition for six of them will be completed by June 2021. These townships can accommodate up to one lakh people. Various businesses and industries will be allowed to set up shop in these townships,” Mr. Mopalwar said.

e-charging stations

After every 40-50 km along the e-way, amenities and charging facilities for electric vehicles will be available. Mr. Mopalwar said an Integrated Traffic Management System will be set up to keep tabs on whether vehicles are speeding, observing lane discipline or suffering breakdowns. The e-way will have eight tunnels, viaducts, a bridge over the railway line, an underpass and an overpass to avoid obstructing the movement of wild animals.

Officially named the Hinduhridaysamrat Balasaheb Thackeray Maharashtra Samruddhi Highway, the road will connect 10 districts, 26 tehsils and 392 villages. The e-way is expected to reduce the travel time between Mumbai and Nagpur to eight hours and boost business along it.

396,2020/10/08,Impose traffic restrictions for passage of Chehlum procession: HC to State,"‘People won’t be allowed to congregate along the route of the procession’

The Bombay High Court has asked the Maharashtra government to impose restrictions on the gathering of people for the Chehlum procession (40th day since Muharram) on October 8, beginning from Masjid-e-Iranian (Imambada Road) to Rehamatabad Qabarastan in Mazgaon.

A Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathawalla and R.I. Chagla was hearing a petition filed by the All India Idaara-Tahafuz-E-Hussainiyat through advocate Asif Naqvi.

Assistant Police Commissioner, Dongri Division, Avinash Dharmadhikari, and senior inspector Deepak Kajave took a decision to permit the procession. They said, “Taking into consideration the situation and the prevailing circumstances throughout Maharashtra and more particularly Mumbai city and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, we allow the petitioners to carry out the procession.”

Habib Nasir, general secretary of All India Idaara-Tahafuz-E-Hussainiyat, said, “There will be only one Tazia, which will be carried from Masjid-e-Iranian (Imambada Road) to Rehmatabad Qabarastan, Mazgaon. No other Tazia will be carried anywhere in the State. In no case whatsoever, any congregation of people at any point from the beginning till the end of the journey will be allowed. Not more than seven people will carry the Tazia on a truck, along with two videographers. However, after the Tazia reaches Rehmatabad Qabarastan, Mazgaon, it will be carried on foot for a distance of not more than 100 metres.”

The court said, “The State government shall, if not already imposed, impose a restriction over gathering of people at the appropriate places, by issuing appropriate orders, including the point where the Tazia is to start its journey, up to and including the graveyard, where the journey will end, by passing appropriate orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”

The Bench also said, “The State shall provide an escort and a pilot car for the truck carrying the Tazia and take appropriate measures to keep the traffic away on the route.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/impose-traffic-restrictions-for-passage-of-chehlum-procession-hc-to-state/article32807282.ece

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and justice GS Kulkarni heard public interest litigation (PIL) pleas seeking a direction to the authorities to issue guidelines to be followed by all media houses – print, television, radio and Internet to refrain from publishing and curtailing any comments which may jeopardise the reputation of the police that may hinder the cause of administration of justice.

A plea sought a direction to news channels to ensure that no media trial takes place, which has the impact of prejudicing the independent investigation being undertaken by the CBI in the case.

Senior advocate Aspi Chinoy, for former directors general of police and former commissioner of police, in another plea, spoke about media trials. He said media should not report on the criminal investigations in a case. Media had been commenting on witnesses and the prosecution. They were running hashtags and a campaign that involved prejudging a case.

Naming anchors of Times Now Navika Kumar and Rahul Shivshankar, Mr. Chinoy said they were crossing the line in reporting the Sushant matter and running hashtags that involved prejudging like #ArrestRhea.

He referred to the guidelines issued by the Press Council of India (PCI): “Norms of Journalistic Conduct”, which contained provisions related to investigative journalism.

He said, “There is a dearth of statutory provision to regulate the media. It is not enough to say that courts have repeatedly warned against media trials. We need specific guidelines for the electronic media. When you make guidelines for the PCI, why not make similar guidelines for broadcasting media on prejudgments, etc. This matter should concern the court.”

The court said, “Somebody should be held guilty. Somebody should be arrested. Is it the duty of the media to suggest anything to the investigating agencies?”

398,2020/10/08,"Republic TV, two others involved in TRP racket: Mumbai police","Owners of Fakt Marathi and Box Cinema have been arrested and charged, says city police chief.

Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh on Thursday said a Television Rating Point (TRP) racket has been busted by the Detection Crime Branch, involving Republic TV, Box Cinema and Fakt Marathi.

Owners of Fakt Marathi and Box Cinema have been arrested and charged with sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) of the Indian Penal Code, Mr. Singh told reporters.

Also Read Explained: TRP and its loopholes

He explained that the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) was an organisation that functioned under the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. It claimed that it powered ₹32,000-crore Indian TV ad industry by providing sharp insights. It had installed approximately 30,000 barometers in various parts of the country to monitor various programmes and based on the statistical metrics.

“In the preliminary enquiry, one person was arrested and he has revealed that he had been working for a company called Hansa Research Group Private Limited, which is a part of the BARC. The accused said the company has misused confidential data, which had been entrusted to them. It has apparently been done for wrongful gains of various TV channels, which had resulted in wrongful loss to various advertisers and their agencies,” Mr. Singh said.

“Hansa’s ex-employee and his companion were arrested and ₹20 lakh were found along with Rs 8.5 lakh in the bank locker. Around ₹400-500 was given to several households on monthly basis. They were produced in court and the police have got their custody till October 9,” he stated

A press release from the police says, “Preliminary investigation also revealed that these accused persons have manipulated the sampling metering services by inducing the barometer users by paying them periodically to watch particular TV channel/s. Many of the people in whose homes these barometers have been installed, have accepted that they have been monetarily beneficial for keeping their TV sets on even if they actually didn’t watch.”

Mr. Singh said, “The money involved can be in hundreds of crores, which are proceeds of crime. We need to find out where is the money, in which accounts and who are the beneficiaries. We will forensically examine them and might freeze the money and accounts if needed.”

He observed, “We will examine directors, promoters, employees, those who look after advertising, distribution and funding of Republic TV. We will examine all the aspects and summon everyone involved in this. We will also call some advertisers they might be a complicit or a victim of this.”

He noted, “BARC submitted their analytical report and found suspicious trends of TRPs on Republic TV. We called some customers who were approached and manipulated and they admitted that they were given money to operate a particular channel all day.”

Arnab’s note

Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami released a statement on social media that said, “Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh has made false allegations against Republic TV because we have questioned him in the Sushant Singh Rajput case investigation. Republic TV will file a criminal defamation case against Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh. There is not a single BARC report that mentions Republic TV. The people of India know the truth. Mr Param Bir Singh’s investigation in the Sushant Singh Rajput case is under a cloud and this is a desperate measure because of Republic TV’s reportage on Palghar, The Sushant Singh Rajput case of any other case. This kind of targeting only strengthens the resolve of everyone at Republic TV to push for the truth even harder. Param Bir Singh stands completely exposed today, since BARC has not mentioned Republic in any single complaint. He should issue an official apology and get ready to face us in court.”

BARC statement

BARC, in a statement, said: “As in all our previous cases of suspected panel homes intrusions, BARC India continues to follow its established vigilance and disciplinary guidelines. BARC remains steadfastly true to its purpose to accurately and faithfully report ‘What India Watches’.”

“BARC India appreciates the efforts of the Mumbai Police and will provide the support asked of it,” a BARC India Spokesperson said.

399,2020/10/08,"Stick to 90 hectares for Coastal Road project in Mumbai, says Supreme Court","Civic body must take CRZ clearance for reclaiming land above it, says apex court

The Supreme Court on Wednesday indicated it may not see a problem with the reclamation of 90 hectares for the Coastal Road Project in Mumbai, but the municipal corporation will have to take CRZ clearance for reclaiming land over the 90-hectare mark.

“We see no problem with the 90 hectare, but anything above 90, you will have to get CRZ clearance... Stick to 90,” Chief Justice S.A. Bobde orally suggested to senior advocate Darius Khambata, representing the municipal corporation, during the hearing.

Mr. Khambata informed the court that his client has already made an application before the Maharashtra CRZ authorities.

Senior advocate Shyam Divan, representing respondents led by Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Matsya Vyavasay Sakhari Society, however said the increase in land reclamation from 90 hectares to 111.5 hectares has transformed the project. “It is a completely different project now... They have completely altered it,” Mr. Divan argued. He sought a blanket stay of the project.

The Bench reserved the issue for passing orders.

The court is hearing an appeal filed by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai against a Bombay High Court decision to stop work on the road project till it gets a proper environmental clearance.

On December 17 last year, the apex court found that the High Court “needs to be stayed having regard to the factor of balance of convenience; prima facie case and irreparable damage/injury”.

The apex court had said the petitioners were “free to reclaim the land, build the road thereon and secure the road. They shall however not carry out any other development work until further orders of this court”.

The various local societies have contended that “the project is not just about a road. It touches on 90 hectares. The road is only a tiny stretch but large areas of land would be reclaimed”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/k0sf0d/article32798477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COASTALROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/stick-to-90-hectares-for-coastal-road-project-in-mumbai-says-supreme-court/article32798478.ece
400,2020/10/08,"Turbhe man flees after raping minor, nabbed in Osmanabad","The Navi Mumbai Police on Tuesday arrested a 30-year-old Turbhe resident in Osmanabad for allegedly raping a 12-year-old girl.

The accused, identified as Vijay Rathod, an autorickshaw driver, dragged the victim from his neighbouring chawl in Turbhe to his house on Sunday evening and allegedly raped her. He then switched off his phone, and told his friends that he was going to Pune.

The girl’s mother found her sitting alone outside the house and asked her what was wrong. At this, she broke down and narrated the ordeal. The parents immediately approached the Turbhe MIDC police station and registered a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

Based on what Mr. Rathod had told his friends, the police circulated his photo and alerted Sukapur toll booth in Panvel and another one at the Pune border.

On realising that this lead was a dead end, the police decided to keep a tab on the calls received by his wife and soon found a call from an unknown number between Monday and Tuesday.

Since Mr. Rathod lived on the outskirts of Osmanabad and the number was also from the same district, the police dispatched a team to Umarga in Osmanabad. By the time the police reached Umarga, he had fled to Holi village in Lohara.

“He was caught from a sugarcane field in Lohara. The police team managed to arrest Mr. Rathod within 48 hours. He was produced before a court in Belapur on Wednesday, and remanded in police custody till October 12,” senior police inspector Sachin Rane from Turbhe police station said.

401,2020/10/08,Crime Branch arrests duo for trying to sell ‘piece of comet’,"Panvel resident was promised that it would fetch ₹25 crore

Two men who allegedly tried to sell a piece of ‘stone’ to a resident of Panvel claiming it to be part of a ‘comet’ that fell on earth and was in demand among international scientists were arrested by the Navi Mumbai Crime Branch.

Acccording to the police, the duo were identified as Afsar Taayar Ali Sayyed (35) from Bhiwandi and Popat Kashinath Khomane (51) from Nerul.

James William George (49) from Panvel was introduced to Mr. Khomane two months ago via a relative. Mr. Khomane, after winning Mr. George’s confidence, one day asked to meet him at Airoli bus depot for some important work. Mr. George, who works as a supervisor at a logistics firm in Mumbai met Mr. Khomane, who showed him a picture and said that it was a ‘piece of comet’ worth ₹25 crore in international market.

Mr. Khomane told Mr. George that he knew of a person who had it and he would be selling it for ₹20 lakh as he was not aware of its international price. Mr. Khomane further said that since he did not have the money, Mr. George should buy it and he would help him further sell it for ₹25 crore from which he would take his share of ₹3 crore to repay his loans.

After Mr. George agreed, Mr. Sayyed was introduced to him as a scientist in possession of the ‘comet piece’, who also showed him a silver colour object in a suitcase. “The accused kept a clock over the ‘stone’ which stopped working. The accused claimed that it was because of the radiation,” senior police inspector Subhash Nikam, Crime Branch Unit I, said.

As a token money, Mr. George paid ₹1 lakh to Mr. Sayyed. The accused then poured some water on the ‘stone’ following which smoke came out of it. The accused claimed that the ‘stone’ had started emitting high radiation and it was not safe to keep it exposed any longer and left after closing the suitcase.

Later, Mr. George discussed this with a friend who told him that no such thing existed and it would be a fraud. When Mr. George asked Mr. Khomane for his money, he refused to return. Mr. George then lodged a complaint at Rabale police station.

On the pretext of paying the rest of the money, Mr. George called Mr. Khomane and Mr. Sayyed to meet, while Crime Branch officials laid a trap and nabbed the duo on October 3.

“The accused are in custody till October 8, and we are investigating how many people they have cheated till now in a similar way. The accused had wrapped a ball of cotton with aluminium foil and copper and made the ‘comet piece’ appear very strange to make it look believable,” assistant police inspector Rahul Rakh from Crime Branch Unit I said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/crime-branch-arrests-duo-for-trying-to-sell-piece-of-comet/article32798320.ece

403,2020/10/08,No problem in reclaiming 90 hectares: SC on coastal road,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday indicated it may not see a problem with the reclamation of 90 hectares for the Coastal Road Project in Mumbai, but the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) would have to take CRZ clearance for reclaiming anything more.

“We see no problem with the 90 hectare, but anything above 90, you will have to get CRZ clearance... Stick to 90,” Chief Justice S.A. Bobde orally suggested to BMC counsel Darius Khambata. He in turn informed the court that his client has already made an application before the Maharashtra CRZ.

Senior advocate Shyam Divan, representing respondents led by Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Matsya Vyavasay Sakhari Society, however said the increase in land reclamation from 90 hectares to 111.5 hectares has transformed the project. “It is a completely different project now... They have completely altered it,” Mr. Divan argued. He sought a blanket stay of the project. The Bench reserved orders on the issue.

The court is hearing an appeal filed by the BMC against a Bombay High Court decision stopping work on the project till it gets a proper environmental clearance.

On December 17 last year, the apex court found that the high court order “needs to be stayed having regard to the factor of balance of convenience; prima facie case and irreparable damage/injury”. The apex court had said the petitioners were “free to reclaim the land, build the road thereon and secure the road. They shall however not carry out any other development work until further orders of this court”.

The various local societies have contended that “the project is not just about a road. It touches on 90 hectares. The road is only a tiny stretch but large areas of land would be reclaimed”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/no-problem-in-reclaiming-90-hectares-sc-on-coastal-road/article32798277.ece

406,2020/10/08,"Photographer walks 11,000 kilometres to capture Britain’s coastal landscape","British photographer, Quintin Lake, walked along Britain’s coast to actualise a photography project that spanned five years and 1,79, 222 photographs

Against a sea of ink blue stands Caernarfon Castle, built by Edward I in 1283, in Gwynedd county, Wales. In another frozen moment, shades of pink, purple and warm orange caress the serene shores of Snettisham Beach in Norfolk as the sun sets. For British photographer Quintin Lake, these sights sum up the diversity of Britain’s coast, along which he had been walking for 454 days, since 2015.

Four hundred and fifty four days and 11,000 kilometres on the trail; 268 days of photo editing; seven worn-out shoes and many months of planning led to Quintin’s project The Perimeter: a collection of 1,79,222 photographs that capture the landscapes that together make Britain’s coast.

On April 17, 2015, he started in London, walking clockwise for 454 days: of which, 200 days were spent in Scotland, 60 in Wales and the rest in England.

Lake, who started off as a commercial landscape photographer almost 20 years back, says he loves being outside. He has travelled to over 70 countries in pursuit of moments and frames. In an email interview, the photographer — who is now at his home in London — says, “To be in the landscape, rather than inside, feels connected to the cosmos... and it’s this connection to things bigger than ourselves that fascinates and satisfies me.”

After training as an architect, he initially used photography to record ideas but soon enough, realised that he is better at perceiving these images as they are, instead of, as a method.

The inspiration for The Perimeter came from earlier projects, in which Lake walked along rivers Thames and Severn from the source to the sea. “When I got to the coastal sections, I was really inspired by the diversity of what I was seeing. I felt this was the key to see Britain with fresh eyes,” he recalls. The British coast, he adds, juxtaposes so many different things in quick succession.

Though Britain is a small island, it has a vast coastline: one-fourth of the circumference of the globe. Its varied geology and history give rise to varied landforms, vegetation, dialects and this difference also seeps into their appearances. “Walking the British coast felt like a beautifully choreographed piece of music – one or two weeks had a particular flavour and then that flavour would change and the topography changes at a walking pace.”

But, why did he choose to walk? A lot of Scotland that comprised 200 days of his trail had no defined path, thanks to its mountainous terrain. “If I felt the storm in my face for a few days, and I felt the soil because I was sleeping on it, then I could also feel the pictures better. I find that if I drive somewhere to take pictures, then I end up taking postcard views,” says Lake.

A path so bleak

Lake’s journey along the Knoydart Peninsula in Scotland was the toughest but also, the most beautiful. As the mountains fall steeply into the sea, the easiest route in this pathless terrain is through mountain ridges and passes. “As it was winter, four hours of everyday involved night hiking with a head torch and each evening, I poured water out of my boots and peeled off wet clothes before entering the sleeping bag,” he recalls.

On the other hand, Scotland in summer was swarmed by midges, which made cooking and resting a great challenge, he says. Another unforgettable experience was in Broomway, on a nine kilometre tidal path connecting the mainland to Foulness Island, which is known as England’s most dangerous path. “The tide comes in faster than a man can run and is affected by wind and air pressure.” he says, explaining that the path (which is invisible on the ground) must be followed very precisely as on one side there is sinking mud and on the other, there is unexploded ordnance. “When I walked it alone, the clouds were reflected in the wet mud like a mirror, so it felt like walking on water.”

Lake started with an ultralight backpack with felt running shoes and Cuben Fibre gear. “But it just wasn’t strong enough, it got shredded! I ended up with Scottish winter mountaineering gear. With food and fuel, I was carrying 20 kilograms at the end. As I was carrying five kilograms of camera gear, I had a very minimal camping setup to save weight. Lake also used a disposable water bottle as it is lighter than the commercially available water bottles. “It is very battered now but it lasted over 400 days so I’ve become very attached to that.”

After a split tendon in his foot that took seven weeks to heal, shin splints and countless blisters he reached the track to Cape Wrath, Scotland’s remote Northwest location — the point of completion.

It was midnight of Sepetember 15. An excerpt from his diary entry of the day reads, “I am overcome by relief and emotion and collapse to my knees to kiss the road in the pouring rain. Exhausted, I pitch the tent below the lighthouse as the beam swings diffused through the dense rain above. The gentle rumble of a generator blends with the rain as I fall asleep.”

407,2020/10/08,Two youth held for faking as ACB sleuths in Chittoor,"The Chittoor urban police in the early hours of Thursday arrested two imposters, who donned the role of Anti-Corruption Bureau sleuths on the job of “conducting special raids on the biggies” in Chittoor.

According to information, a youth, Hari Krishna, a native of Chittoor district, contacted the personal assistant of Chittoor MLA on Wednesday midnight, identifying himself as Deputy SP (ACB). He informed the PA that his team was camping at a lodge in Chittoor and few more sleuths were on the way to conduct raids on some influential persons in Chittoor, including the MLA. To be more credulous, the imposter was said to have furnished some confidential information pertaining to the MLA’s assets. The imposter was said to have provided a mobile number, asking him to send ₹7000 for “food expenses” of his team, contending that they had no ready cash at the midnight hour.

As the requirement from the other end sounded suspicious after a while, the PA in turn informed the MLA about the matter, which was flashed to the police of the I and II towns in Chittoor. With the help of the mobile number given for Google-Pay, the police raided a lodge in the town and took two persons into custody, including Hari Krishna and his accomplice. Preliminary information is that the duo had resorted to the same trick on two more influential persons in the town simultaneously. Some documents showing information pertaining to the assets of some political and business biggies elsewhere in Chittoor district and other parts of the state were seized from them.

411,2020/10/08,"Adopt high-density planting system, cotton farmers told","Tamil Nadu Agricultural University's (TNAU) Cotton Research Station (CRS) in Perambalur district has advocated adoption of high-density planting system (HDPS) and mechanisation to ensure higher yields and returns.

During the World Cotton Day celebration at the CRS in Veppanthattai in the district on Wednesday, cotton farmers were also apprised about a compact variety CO 17 with a yield potential of 1,800 kg per hectare under irrigated conditions and suitable for HDPS and mechanical harvesting.

The CRS has identified the new compact type, zero monopodial cotton culture, suited for rainfed cultivation in Perambalur district, S. Somasundaram, Associate Professor and Head, Cotton Research Station, said.

The compact cultivars with synchronised, early maturing, short stature, zero monopodia (no vegetative branches) fewer bolls plant are well-suited for mechanical harvesting, K. Sakthivel, Assistant Professor, Plant Breeding and Genetitics, said. Conventional cotton varieties cannot be used under HDPS system, he said, adding that the bushy formation was not suited for mechanical harvesting.

Detailing India's leadership in cotton cultivation and production at the global level, Prof. Somasundarm said that mechanisation was inevitable for sustenance in cultivation of cotton.

Cotton picking by hand was the most difficult, tiresome and labour-intensive job. The average labour requirement was 517 man hours per hectare. One person can pick about 15 to 20 kg cotton every day. But, by machine harvesting, a maximum of 2,180 kg could be realised, Prof. Somasundaram said.

The TNAU was keen on seeing through the transition of farmers for mechanical harvesting, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/adopt-high-density-planting-system-cotton-farmers-told/article32805729.ece

413,2020/10/08,Commercial Tax Office Complex to function as temporary Collectorate in Mayiladuthurai,"The Commercial Tax Office Complex will function as the temporary collectorate for the newly-formed Mayiladuthurai district.

Proposals were sent to the office of Commissioner for Revenue Administration for formation of an additional Division with Sirkazhi as headquarters following the public hearing conducted on July 30 for demarcation of the boundaries for the new district carved out of Nagapattinam district.

Mayiladuthurai district was formed with Kuthalam, Mayiladuthurai, Sirkazhi, and Tranquebar taluks. Two new taluks with Kollidam and Sembanaarkovil as headquarters are likely to be created for the new district.

Nagapattinam district was left with the taluks of Kilvelur, Nagapattinam, Thirukkuvalai and Vedaranyam. At the public hearing in Nagapattinam on the same day, the participants raised demand for creation of a new division with Vedaranyam as headquarters.

According to officials, there were demands for creation of more taluks in Nagapattinam district and bifurcation of villages as well in Vedaranyam block. The need for bifurcation of some of the villages as big as 15 square kilometres was felt in the aftermath of the Gaja cyclone when the administration faced tough situations in reaching out to the affected people with relief, it is learnt.

The demands raised during the public hearings were under the consideration of the Commissioner of Revenue Administration.

The Dharmapuram Adheenam in Mayiladuthurai has come forward to provide substantial land for establishing a permanent collectorate complex. This proposal is also being processed, official sources said, indicating that the extent of land required for the Collectorate was not available in the town limits. Though the Adheenam land is away from the urban limits, the location was being considered in view of the requirement of a huge land parcel for the new Collectorate.

In all likelihood, the announcement on functioning of the new Mayiladuthurai district, for which the government had already posted a Special Officer and a Superintendent of Police, will be made any time soon, sources added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/commercial-tax-office-complex-to-function-as-temporary-collectorate-in-mayiladuthurai/article32805341.ece
414,2020/10/08,Connectivity issue hits biometric authentication at ration shops,"Many cardholders in rural areas were forced to wait for a long time to get the commodities

Tiruchi

Connectivity issue hits the biometric authenticated Public Distribution System (PDS) in different parts of the district.

The system, aimed at preventing bogus transactions at ration shops and unauthorised use of ration cards, has been implemented in the district since August 1. Tiruchi was one among the four districts in the State where the new system was introduced on a pilot basis. As per the system, the cardholders will have to authorise themselves by placing their thumb on the biometric devices at the ration shops for getting the commodities. The salesmen have been asked to distribute PDS items only after the device reads and authenticates the thumb impression.

However, complaints have cropped up in different parts, mainly rural areas, of the districts that cardholders were forced to wait in long queues for a long time to draw the commodities. There were instances of customers, after standing in queues for long, returning home without buying the commodities. Connectivity issues were said to be the reason for the delay.

“I waited for more than two hours on Wednesday to buy commodities at a ration shop on Nelson Road in Thiruvanaikoil. Since the biometric device failed to read the thumb impressions, many cardholders were asked to visit the shop the next day. We often face the problem,” says S. Subramani, a cardholder in Thiruvanaikoil.

Enquiries revealed that many ration shops in rural areas had been facing the issue. It was acute in the ration shops at Kannuthur, Inamputhur, Vaiyamalapalayam, Elaman and Purathakudi villages in Manapparai and Vaiyampatti unions. Poor internet connectivity and server issues were leading to problems in completing the sales process. Though the new system was in force since August 1, the issue had turned worse over the past week.

416,2020/10/08,"After beneficiaries of MGNREGS test positive, 3 site supervisors sacked","After a section of beneficiaries of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) tested positive for COVID-19, the District Collector has removed three site supervisors from work. It is the supervisor’s responsibility to ensure the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is maintained, he said.

There were lapses in the SOP and the workers had taken off their face masks during breaks, M. Govinda Rao, District Collector said. “The site supervisors were instructed to ensure masks were worn at all times and that they maintained personal distance, since the number of those testing positive increased, they were suspended,” he said.

Clusters were identified among the workers who tested positive in Kalanaivasal and Sornakadu, after which three site supervisors were removed. “Many of the patients were primary contacts of patients who tested positive earlier,” he said.

The Project Officer of the District Rural Development Authority said that of the 70,000 beneficiaries in the district, 234 had tested positive for COVID-19. Among them, a large number tested positive over the last month.

Most patients were asymptomatic, and went unnoticed. “We do not allow the beneficiaries to come to work if they have cold, cough or fever. However, since many of them were asymptomatic, we could not contain the spread,” he said.

A coordination meeting was convened after the removal of the supervisors. Chaired by the District Collector, the attendees, including Block Development Officers, supervisors and field level staff were instructed to ensure six feet distance, and that they wear masks at all times.

Field-level staff have also been instructed to conduct inspections and monitor the adherence to the SOPs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/after-beneficiaries-of-mgnregs-test-positive-3-site-supervisors-sacked/article32803940.ece
417,2020/10/08,Procurement of paddy with up to 20% moisture content recommended,"The district administration has recommended to the government relaxation of norms on the maximum permissible moisture content in the paddy procured through the Direct Purchase Centres (DPCs) following widespread requests from farmers in view of the sporadic rains.

“We have recommended to the government that paddy with moisture content of up to 20% may be procured (as against the current limit of 17%),” Collector M. Govinda Rao told reporters in Kumbakonam on Thursday.

Mr. Rao said that that such as relaxation had been given about four years ago. “In the mean time we are trying to help farmers and are also exploring the feasibility of extending some technological support to dry the paddy,” he added.

He maintained that paddy was being kept safely at the DPCs. Each permanent DPC has space to store about 100 tonnes. Besides, farmers have been provided tarpaulins under various government schemes.

Mr. Rao said 252 DPCs have been opened for the current kharif season offering revised rates to farmers and more would be opened wherever needed. During 2019-20, a record 7.7 lakh tonnes of paddy was procured in Thanjavur district.

Kuruvai paddy was raised on 58,945 hectares (ha) in the district, against the target of 43,825 ha thanks to the timely release of water and the execution of kudimaramathu works. Harvest has been completed on about 45,000 ha. Significantly, the average yield has also increased to 6.2 tonnes a ha against the normal of six tonnes a ha, he said.

He also expressed confidence that the area under coverage during samba will also exceed the targeted 1.27 lakh ha in the district. Already 35,000 ha has been covered. Steps have been taken to extend timely credit to farmers and so far about ₹137 crore has been disbursed as crop loans against the target of ₹344 crore. Adequate stocks of seeds, fertilizers and other inputs was being made available.

PM KISAN Scheme fraud

Answering a query, the Collector said that a field inquiry conducted jointly by the Revenue and Agriculture department officials has revealed that about 5,000 ineligible persons had received financial assistance to the extent of ₹1.60 crore sanctioned under the PM Kisan Scheme. “We have recovered ₹1.40 crore of this and two computer centres through which the irregularities were committed have been closed. Besides, the services of four data entry operators working on contract basis have been terminated,” he said.

COVID-19

On the pandemic situation, Mr. Rao said that the district had only 1,268 active cases as on Thursday and attributed the recent increase in number of average daily cases to the relaxation of lockdown norms and movement of people. More cases were being reported from rural areas now while earlier it was the urban centres which reported high number of cases. However, a trend of slight decline in the case load was perceptible over the past few days, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/procurement-of-paddy-with-up-to-20-moisture-content-recommended/article32803840.ece
418,2020/10/08,Farmers against acquiring farm lands for laying Thiruvaiyaru bypass road,"A section of farmers staged a black flag protest at Kandiyur on Thursday against the reported move to acquire farm lands for laying a bypass road at Thiruvariyaru on the Perambalur-Manamadurai national highway.

The farmers, led by P. Sukumaran, district vice president, Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, got into agricultural fields and staged a demonstration.

The farmers alleged that about 100 acres of farm lands was proposed to be acquired at Kandiyur, Arasur, Thirupanthurithi and a few other villages near Thiruvaiyaru for laying the new by-pass road. The move was reportedly shelved in 2019 owing to stiff opposition from farmers. But officials were now conducting land surveys to demarcate the land to be acquired, they charged.

Rather than acquire farm lands to build a new bypass road, the existing road can be widened by removing encroachments, they suggested.

Some of the farmers held black flags while a few others carried begging bowls in their hands as a symbolic protest to highlight their plight.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/fm6wns/article32809642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY09FARMERSTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/farmers-against-acquiring-farm-lands-for-laying-thiruvaiyaru-bypass-road/article32803561.ece
419,2020/10/08,Is a new bridge over Cauvery river on the cards?,"Highways mulls constructing a new one but says it will be a long term plan

With motorists commuting on the bridge across the Cauvery river in the city continuing to experience severe jolts due to gaps in the expansion joints despite repeated repairs by the Highways Department, residents of Srirangam are now clamouring for the construction of a new bridge.

A senior Highways Department official said they were planning to take up a study for rehabilitation of the existing bridge and also on the feasibility of constructing a new bridge. However, he indicated that the move was in still in the drawing board stage and constructing a new bridge will be a long term plan.

Built in 1976, the Cauvery bridge is a vital link connecting Tiruchi city with Srirangam and caters to a huge volume of traffic. Extensive damages to the road surface at some of the expansion joints in between the spans of the bridge forced the Highways Department to take up repairs repeatedly over the past few years.

In September 2018, the department officials had said that advanced guniting methods were used to repair the damaged edges. The work was taken up at six expansion joints where broken edges were identified. Repairs were taken up subsequently at a few other joints on the bridge. Yet gaps keep surfacing on the expansion joints of the bridge

“The gaps make for a back breaking ride. It is time the Highways Department came with a new bridge. Since it is vital link, there is a need for proper planning,” said T. M. Ranganathan, a resident of Srirangam.

Residents are exasperated over the repeated repairs without much relief. “The repairs have not helped; we are not sure whether any further rehabilitation of the bridge will also be fruitful as the gaps keep re-surfacing. It is better to go for a new bridge,” observed B. Hemanathan, president, Arangama Nagar Nala Sangam.

The Highways Department says it will initiate a proposal soon. “We are going to prepare an estimate for rehabilitating the bridge fully; we have deployed experts to study the structure right from its base on the river bed. In the meanwhile, a proposal to build a new bridge will be drawn up and forwarded to the government for approval,” said a senior official of the Highways Department

However, Highways officials are wary of giving a time frame for their plans to materialise. “Everything is under study right now. We cannot say when the rehabilitation or the proposal for a new bridge will be approved,” the official said.

When pointed out that a team from the Highways Research Station, Chennai, studied the bridge a few years back and had given its recommendations, the official conceded that the team had given its findings based on which some remedial measures were carried out on the road surface of the bridge. “We now want to diagnose the entire bridge,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/2thkdn/article32803486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY09CAUVERYTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/is-a-new-bridge-over-cauvery-river-on-the-cards/article32803487.ece

421,2020/10/08,T-Rex fossil sells for record-breaking $31.8 million,"The fossil, nicknamed Stan, stands 13 feet high and 40 feet long, with puncture marks in the skull and neck that experts believe show evidence of fights with fellow T-Rexes.

One of the most complete specimens of a T-Rex fossil in the world was sold for a record $31.8 million Tuesday by Christie's in New York, nearly quadrupling the previous highest price for a dinosaur at auction.

The apex predator made mincemeat of Christie's opening price of between six and eight million dollars, showing off the lasting power of the T-Rex.

It then shredded the previous record set by a specimen called Sue that was sold for $8.4 million in October 1997 by Sotheby's to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.

Only around 50 Tyrannosaurus fossils have been discovered since the first was unearthed in 1902.

Bids hit the $9 million mark in less than two minutes after the start of the auction, but after 14 minutes there were just three bidders left in the race, until the hammer came down on an offer of $27.5 million, to which were added costs and commissions.

The sale was organized in New York, where the expert assessor was located, but with lines open to Hong Kong and London, where Christie's specialists were taking calls from collectors.

The fossil, nicknamed Stan, stands 13 feet high and 40 feet long, with puncture marks in the skull and neck that experts believe show evidence of fights with fellow T-Rexes. He would have weighed in at around eight tons when alive, some 67 million years ago.

The fossil was discovered in South Dakota in 1987 and named after the amateur paleontologist who came across the remains, Stan Sacrison.

Paleontologists from the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in South Dakota spent more than 30,000 hours excavating and then assembling the 188 bones of the skeleton.

Casts were then taken for dozens of museums around the world that wanted a copy of this exceptional specimen of Tyrannosaur, which experts believe was around 20 years old when it died.

Ironically, the terms of the sale prevent the buyer from producing 3D models of the dinosaur.

By law, such specimens can only be sold if the fossil was discovered on private land, which in this case it was.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/r1rdii/article32801329.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0008Q26X6,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/t-rex-fossil-sells-for-record-breaking-318-million/article32801330.ece
422,2020/10/08,"Oleander, cassia, ixora... flowers of Kerala as motifs on merchandise","Flowers and fruits endemic to Kerala are finding unconventional interpretations as motifs on a range of products, from notepads to saris

Kochi:Vibrant yellow cassia (konna) and little tree plant (mukkutti), red hibiscus (chembarathi ) and ixora (chethi)... flowers typical of Kerala brighten up the covers of a set of 12 mini-notebooks. As do oleander (arali ), plumeria (chembakam) and gulmohar on T-shirts, mugs, and notebook covers; banana leaves, mangoes, water lilies and hyacinths, bunches of plantains, pepper vines and papaya trees on saris.

Elephants, coconut palms, Kathakali and theyyam motifs are passé. Designers, artistes, and organisations are using native flora and fauna on a range of products to tell the Kerala story, using them as motifs to present the State to the market outside: either as means of attention and education to outside ‘audiences’, or as a proud showcase.

The set of 12 mini-notebooks, each for a month of the Malayalam calendar – Kollam Era or Kollavarsham – was launched by the Palakkad chapter of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), intended as an introduction to the Malayalam calendar.

The bouquet of INTACH Palakkad notebooks

Each notebook corresponds with a Malayalam month. The flower on the cover is one that blooms that month; some seasonal, others perennial. “The flowers added a second layer, primarily it is to educate about the months of the Malayalam calendar so that we don’t lose touch; our imagination is synced with the Gregorian calendar,” says Arun Narayanan of INTACH.

The idea is about more than grabbing eyeballs, it is about telling the Kerala story. Ratheesh Menon, of Coconut Stories, a gifting/lifestyle brand, picked six flowers — ixora, plumeria, hibiscus, gulmohar, lotus and oleander — using them on merchandise such as T-shirts, notebooks, and badges. “Each flower, each motif has a story. These are culturally significant, so I want to showcase them and, perhaps, introduce them to others outside, as other brands have done using cultural references of other places,” says Menon.

The late artist Rajan M Krishnan ‘showed’ others the ubiquitous jackfruit tree. In works such as Memorial, Plant of Sustenance and Self-bearing Jackfruits, he celebrated the tree, often laden with fruit, as a signifier of freedom of expression.

A Jebsispar sari

Muvattupuzha-based designer Jebin Johny’s label Jebsispar has a design sensibility unapologetically and boldly rooted in Kerala. He does not shy away from using motifs including fish fry, plantain bunches, pepper vines, papaya trees as prints on saris and dresses.

“I wanted my ‘stories’ [designs] to be authentic and convey real emotions. Whether it is the oonu (sadhya) design, or the banana tree or papaya, or jackfruit or pepper… it is about my upbringing, my childhood, my bond with family,” he says. Among those who have worn his designs are Sonam Kapoor, Kalki Koechlin and Vidya Balan.

Designer Sreejith Jeevan uses motifs for his label Rouka by Sreejith Jeevan. In 2015, he designed a collection called ‘Dasapushpam’, drawing inspiration from the 10 flowers and herbs native to Kerala. The NID alumnus’ stint with Ikea, developing prints, set him thinking about flora and fauna placed within a local, seasonal context. “They are particular about not doing a summer collection with winter flowers, for example. That’s when I started thinking about flowers and their cultural/seasonal associations. If it is Vishu, it has to be konna (cassia), doesn’t it?” he says.

He equates Kerala fauna being mainstreamed with Kerala cuisine exploding into the country’s culinary scene. Echoing Narayanan, he says, “We haven’t been educated about local things; this might be an interesting way of talking about it.”

“People like stories in general; they are buying into the idea of a local narrative, something with a feel of Kerala,” Jeevan says, adding that when a non-Malayali, “alien to our culture, language and ethnicity invests, it gives a lot of confidence and recognition.”

Won’t the market tire of these motifs? Says Jeevan, “You can always find variations and reinvent... hasn’t it been done to the rose?”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/2yjmd2/article32803732.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpflowers11jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/flowers-and-fruits-endemic-to-kerala-are-being-used-as-motifs-on-a-range-of-products-from-notepads-to-saris/article32803740.ece
423,2020/10/08,Pick my cloth is a market place for weavers,"An ecommerce website that helps weavers and buyers connect directly

For the lovers of handloom and ardent supporters of craftsmen, this could be a one-stop shop if the e-market place, PickMyCloth (PMC) — established by Ram Kalyan, P V Abhishek and Dinesh Suram —lives up to its claim of bridging the gap between the craftsmen and the customer.

The handloom industry that often suffers at the hands of middleman who pocket huge commissions, is facing worse hardships due to the pandemic. As tourism came to a grinding halt, businesses that dealt with weavers were also hugely affected. Ram Kalyan, one of the founders of PickMyCloth says, “They are still facing a crisis as a result of fierce competition with modern machinery. These weavers are living in poverty, struggling to make both ends meet. I came to know about them first in 2014 when I was studying in NIT(National Institute Technology) Warangal. Friends who studied with me, from the weaving community, often expressed their concern about the craft and profits. They bemoaned that most government sops meant to benefit weavers, hardly reached them. The weavers were often exploited by middlemen who enjoy the lion’s share of the price. Those discussions from my IIT days stayed with me. So when we decided to start something on our own, we saw nothing better than helping the weaving communities we take pride in as Indians.”

Ram is the key operational person taking care of boarding the weavers on the platform. He travelled the length and breadth of India to research on Indian handloom.

The idea of working with the weaving community further strengthened as the trio set out visiting craftsmen and weavers to see what can be done. “We were amazed at the potential of these talented craftsmen around the country. Their products are of excellent natural material, crafted with perfection. Thus ‘PickMyCloth’ was born,” says Ram.

Started in January 2019 PMC successfully added over 13000 products with 650 weavers on board from 20 different handloom clusters across different regions in India like West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Benaras, Maharastra, Pochampally and Siddipet etc. Making inventory as one of its most powerful feature, PMC has been able to get traction from buyers as well as sellers, especially during the lockdown. “We noticed a 30% increase in buyer activity during the wedding season. A very popular product on our website, apart from traditional sarees are the kanchi dupattas,” shares Ram.

#WeaverRevolution’ tailored by PickMyCloth, following Mahatma Gandhi’s footsteps and his ideologies is the backbone of the organisation, informs Dinesh who handles the marketing and technology.

The portal is open to all Indian weavers and craftsmen. Presently over 650 weavers are listed on the website apart from leather craftsmen from Dharavi region of Mumbai. Dinesh Suram who worked with with Reliance Industries in Mumbai until he started working on PMC from 2018, deals with the whole leather cluster of Dharavi.

“We have made PMC in such a way that the seller decides the price and display of his product. Once listed, they get the login details to upload their own weaves and decide the price. We only provide the platform and want the weavers to make profits and get what they truly deserve,” says Ram.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/aj9j17/article32802238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Apickmycloth2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/pickmycloth-an-e-market-place-for-indian-weavers-and-craftsmen/article32802239.ece

Mexican scientist Mario Molina, who became his country's first winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work on the threat to the ozone layer from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), has died at the age of 77, the government said on Wednesday.

One of Mexico's most eminent scientists, Molina conducted some of his first experiments at a tender age in his childhood home before becoming a global authority on climate change.

The government and his former university announced Molina's death, but the cause was not immediately clear.

Also Read Ozone layer is recovering, says UN

Born in Mexico City, Molina was a graduate of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and took postgraduate degrees at universities in Germany and California.

In 2008, he was appointed a scientific adviser to U.S. President Barack Obama and also advised authorities in the Mexican capital on their efforts to reduce smog and air pollution, a chronic problem in the metropolis.

Laboratory at home

When Molina was a small boy, his parents bought him a microscope. He recalled transforming one bathroom into a makeshift laboratory and was at the age of 10 already devouring biographies of Nobel laureates, such as Marie Curie.

In 1995, Molina, Frank Sherwood Rowland and Paul Crutzen were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work showing how CFCs used in spray cans were destroying the ozone layer.

Molina worked at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego (UCSD), a key center of learning on phenomena linked to climate change.

His commitment to fighting global warming set Molina at odds with Mexico's current government, which has pursued an energy agenda aimed at strengthening state energy firms whose business models depend heavily on the use of polluting fossil fuels.

In an interview with Reuters in July, Molina vigorously condemned that policy, saying his homeland was “going backwards to the last century - or the one before” on climate change, an assessment the government denies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/u44h97/article32801518.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MEXICO-MOLINA,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/mexican-nobel-laureate-molina-ozone-layer-prophet-dies-at-77/article32801519.ece
425,2020/10/08,Study points to nitrous oxide emissions derailing Paris climate accord temperature target,"‘Current emissions are tracking global temperature increases above 3 degrees Celsius, twice the temperature target of the Paris accord’

Rising nitrous oxide emissions may negate current global attempts to keep temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius by the turn of the century, and agriculture practices in India, Brazil, China and the United States play a significant role in this, says a study that appeared in the journal Nature on Wednesday.

“Current emissions are tracking global temperature increases above 3 degrees Celsius, twice the temperature target of the Paris accord,” said Robert Jackson, Professor and a co-author from Stanford University and chair of the Global Carbon Project.

The growing use of nitrogen fertilizers in the production of food worldwide is increasing concentrations of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere — a greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide — which remains in the atmosphere longer than a human lifetime.

Nitrous oxide has risen 20% — from 220 parts per billion (ppb) in the pre-industrial era to 331 ppb in 2018 — and its growth has accelerated over recent decades due to emissions from various human activities.

“The atmospheric N2O burden increased from 1.4 billion ton in the 1980s to 1.5 billion ton in 2007-2016, with a possible uncertainty of ±20 million tons. Our results show a substantial increase in global N2O emissions that is primarily driven by anthropogenic sources, as natural sources remained relatively steady throughout the study period,” says the research paper.

Emissions from synthetic fertilizer dominates releases in China, India and the U.S., while emissions from the application of livestock manure as fertilizer dominates releases in Africa and South America, the study found. “The highest growth rates in emissions are found in emerging economies, particularly Brazil, China and India, where crop production and livestock numbers have increased,” said an accompanying press statement.

The failure to include N2O within climate mitigation strategies will need even greater abatement of CO2 and methane (also a greenhouse gas). Although N2O mitigation is difficult because nitrogen is the key limiting nutrient in agricultural production, this study demonstrates that effective mitigation actions have reduced emissions in some regions — such as Europe — through technological improvements in industry and improved efficiency of nitrogen use in agriculture.

The significant increase in nitrous oxide was being driven by China, and it was only Europe, as a region, that had successfully tapered emissions, said N. Raghuram, Former Dean, School of Biotechnology, Indraprastha University, and chairman of the Indian Nitrogen Assessment (INA) initiative. “India has managed to slow nitrogen emissions growth since 2015 in part due to the neem-coating of urea policy that reduced atmospheric loss of the element as well as soil contamination. “However, more needs to be done and there are lessons from Europe on how to go about this,” he told The Hindu.

Though agriculture remains the largest contributor to nitrogen emissions, non-agricultural emissions of nitrogen oxides and nitrous oxide were also growing rapidly, with sewage and fossil-fuel burning — for power, transport and industry — leading the trend. Indian Nox (nitrous oxides) emissions grew at 52% from 1991 to 2001 and 69% from 2001 to 2011, the INA had reported in 2018.

Agricultural soils contributed to over 70% of N2O emissions from India in 2010, followed by waste water (12%), and residential and commercial activities (6%). Since 2002, N2O has replaced methane as the second largest greenhouse gas from Indian agriculture.

Chemical fertilizers (over 82% of it is urea) account for over 77% of all agricultural N2O emissions in India, while manure, compost and so on make up the rest. Most of the fertilizers consumed (over 70%) go into the production of cereals, especially rice and wheat, which account for the bulk of N2O emissions from India.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/2zh073/article32798472.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FERTLIZERKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/study-points-to-nitrous-oxide-emissions-derailing-paris-climate-accord-temperature-target/article32798473.ece
