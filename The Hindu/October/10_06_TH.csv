0,2020/10/06,"Saina Nehwal, Parupalli Kashyap pull out of Denmark Open","“I withdrew from Denmark Open. I decided that I will start the season from January only with the Asian tour,” said Saina Nehwal

Saina Nehwal and her husband P. Kashyap have pulled out of the Denmark Open to be held in Odense (Denmark) from Oct. 13.

“One of the main reasons is that we were not sure about the COVID-19 threat and the safety measures in place in Denmark where cases have been on the rise,” World No. 24 Kashyap told The Hindu.

“Secondly, with no ranking points at stake for the Olympic qualifiers, we thought it was not worth the risk. I also had some niggle in the right leg for three days though I am feeling much better,” said Kashyap.

“Saina and I felt that it would be better to start our international campaign early next year.”

PTI adds

The BWF World Tour was shut down following the completion of the All England Championships in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I withdrew from Denmark Open. I decided that I will start the season from January only with the Asian tour,” Saina, the London Olympics bronze-medallist, told PTI.

The husband-wife duo had earlier sent their entries for the $750,000 tournament and also submitted their consent letter to the Badminton Association of India (BAI) last month for the same.

The Badminton World Federation (BWF) postponed the Thomas and Uber Cup Finals (Oct 3-11), three events in Asia (in November) to 2021 and also cancelled the Denmark Masters (Oct 20-25).

The Denmark Open is thus the only World Tour event scheduled to be held in the remainder of the season.

Asked if she has any fitness concerns, Saina, a two-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist, said: “There is no injury issue but if three tournaments were there it would have made sense... I thought directly from January, I can go for the Asian tour”.

The withdrawal of former world no.1 Saina, one of the Olympic hopefuls for next year’s Tokyo Games, means there will be no Indian participation in the women’s singles event at Odense as world champion P.V. Sindhu has already pulled out.

Kashyap, currently ranked world No.24, also decided to skip the event for similar reasons.

“I too feel it is not worth the risk to go all the way for one tournament. It is better to start the season afresh participating in the Asia leg from January,” the London Games quarterfinalist said.

According to the adjusted international calender, Badminton World Federation had planned to host three back-to-back events in Denmark -- Thomas and Uber Cup Finals, Denmark Open and Denmark Masters.

This was to be followed by three successive events in Asia, including the World Tour Finals.

However, BWF decided to postpone the Thomas and Uber Cup to 2021 after top teams withdrew due to COVID-19 pandemic and also cancelled the Denmark Masters.

The apex body also deferred the Asia leg to January due to the current circumstances.

1,2020/10/06,French Open | Podoroska’s dream run continues,"Stuns Svitolina to become the first woman qualifier to reach the semifinals

Argentine Nadia Podoroska became the first qualifier to reach the French Open semifinals in the women’s singles draw when she downed Ukrainian third seed Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-4 on Tuesday.

The World No. 131, on her second appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam, emulates Belgium’s Filip Dewulf, the only qualifier in either of the singles draws since tennis turned professional in 1968 to make it to the last four at Roland Garros, in 1997.

“It’s a little bit difficult for me to speak after the match, thank you everybody for your support, I’m very very happy,” Podoroska said on court Philippe Chatrier. “We did a very good job with my coaches during quarantine. That’s why I’m here today.”

Svitolina, one of the pre-tournament favourites after winning the Strasbourg International last month, was on the back foot throughout, failing at the last-eight stage for the third time at the claycourt Grand Slam.

Coming into Tuesday’s match, the 23-year-old Podoroska had won seven matches in a row at Roland Garros, and she kept that momentum going against Svitolina.

Turning it on

The Ukrainian broke her serve in the first game, but then Podoroska turned on the engine and bagged five games in a row to move to 5-1. Having converted all of her four break points while Svitolina converted only two of six, Podoroska found herself one set up after 37 minutes.

Perfectly mixing power and a gentle touch with drop shots, Podoroska proved too skilful for Svitolina, who looked nothing like the player who reached the semifinals at Wimbledon and the US Open last year.

Six consecutive games went against serve in the second set until Podoroska held for 5-4 before wrapping it up on Svitolina’s serve on her second match point with a forehand winner.

Collins stops Jabeur

Earlier in the day, unseeded Danielle Collins battled past 30th seed Tunisian Ons Jabeur 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 to reach the quarterfinals for the first time in her career.

In the men’s section, German wildcard Daniel Altmaier’s impressive run was ended by Spain’s Pablo Carreno Busta as the 17th seed claimed a 6-2, 7-5, 6-2 victory late on Monday. Carreno Busta had to weather a second-set fightback by the 22-year-old but proved too experienced as he reached the quarterfinals for the second time. His reward is a clash with top seed Novak Djokovic in a repeat of their US Open fourth round when the Serbian World No. 1 was defaulted for hitting a line judge with a ball.

Match-fixing probe

Meanwhile, French prosecutors on Tuesday said they have opened an investigation on Oct. 1 into alleged match-fixing in a women’s doubles match.

The prosecutors’ office said the investigation into “fraud in an organised group” and “active and passive corruption”, was related to a match between Romanian pair of Andreea Mitu and Patricia Mari and Russian Yana Sizikova and American Madison Brengle.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/xfxnuz/article32786169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NADIAKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/french-open-podoroskas-dream-run-continues/article32786171.ece
2,2020/10/06,Coronavirus | Zverev says he is negative for Covid-19 after Roland Garros controversy,"He was up to date with his tournament-mandated Covid-19 tests, the French Tennis Federation said

Germany's Alexander Zverev said on Monday he had tested negative for Covid-19, a day after he had played a match at Roland Garros despite feeling unwell.

“I wanted to update everyone that I have again tested negative for Covid,” the world number seven wrote on Instagram.

“I wasn't 100% yesterday and I will take a few days to recover.”

Zverev said he “should not have played” after his French Open last 16 loss on Sunday to Italian teenager Jannik Sinner and complained of feeling “completely sick”.

The 23-year-old was up to date with his tournament-mandated Covid-19 tests, the French Tennis Federation (FFT) said in a statement on Sunday. His last one before Monday was on September 29.

However, the FFT added that the German “did not consult the tournament doctors before his match”.

Zverev told German Eurosport on Monday that he had been suffering from a cold.

“We have been playing at eight degrees and drizzle for two weeks,” he said. “I have had a bit of a sore throat, then a cold. The fever was 37.6.”

He added that it was his understanding there was no obligation to inform tournament officials of an illness.

The U.S. Open runner-up raised questions over whether he should have been allowed to play when he told reporters he had a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 Fahrenheit) following his win over Marco Cecchinato on Friday.

The FFT said on Sunday that Zverev's previous coronavirus test was negative. The result was received on September 30.

4,2020/10/06,Mercedes’ EVs to be powered by solid-state batteries. What are these batteries?,"Solid state batteries with a very high energy density can store more energy than lithium ion batteries. They can also last longer, and are safer to use.

Most electronic products and electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries to store power and to run devices.

But Mercedes-Benz AG is working with a Canadian battery material specialist Hydro-Québec to develop solid state batteries for its electric cars.

The duo agree that solid-state lithium metal batteries will be the next important milestone in electric vehicle technology.

""Our development programme will allow us to test new materials, and respond to the concerns of automobile manufacturers,"" said Karim Zaghib, General Manager of Hydro-Québec’s center of excellence in transportation electrification and energy storage.

Solid-state batteries use a solid electrolyte, instead of the liquid electrolyte used in lithium-ion batteries.

A battery stores chemical energy, and converts it into electrical energy. It has three basic parts: anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Cathode is the positive end of the battery, and anode is negative; they are the two electrodes. And electrolyte transports ions, electrically charged atoms, between the two ends.

Solid state batteries with a very high energy density can store more energy than lithium ion batteries. They can also last longer, and are safer to use, said Zaghib.

The chemical reactions in the battery causes a build up of electrons at the anode and a shortage of electrons at the cathode. This results in an electrical difference between the anode and the cathode. The electrons want to get rid of this difference and move to the cathode.

But the electrolyte blocks the electrons from moving from the anode to the cathode within the battery.

If the battery is connected to an external circuit, the electrons move through it. This flow of electrons provides an electric current that can be used to do work.

Solid electrolytes open up the scope of using new types of anode like lithium metal. This makes it possible to have higher energy content with better safety than today’s graphite anode.

New generations of these materials will be quick to charge and are non-flammable.

The companies are now working on a ceramic solution that can be used as solid-state electrolytes. Ceramic materials are stable in very high temperatures. They can also tolerate such high temperatures during fast charging.

There is not one battery technology that can suit all industries and applications. We will need diverse energy storage technologies for a sustainable future, said Zaghib.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/91jchq/article32784652.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/solidstatebattery,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/mercedes-evs-to-be-powered-by-solid-state-batteries-what-are-these-batteries/article32784626.ece
5,2020/10/06,Microsoft gets exclusive license to use GPT-3 language model. What does the model mean?,"GPT-3 has 175 billion machine learning parameters, over 100 times more than its predecessor.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Microsoft recently received an exclusive license to use OpenAI’s GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model in its own products and services. The model uses deep learning method to create human-like text in real-time.

The third-generation model built by San Francisco-based AI research company OpenAI is available to developers via the OpenAI application programming interface (API), which can be used to develop applications and services.

GPT-3 and its applications

GPT-3 has 175 billion machine learning (ML) parameters, over 100 times more than its predecessor. The ML parameters are crucial for solving problem as they look into multiple configurations to approach a specific task. It also represents the skill and complexity level of the model.

The latest generation has been designed to understand inputs in English and to generate output with minimal interactions or adjustments from a user.

To generate text, the model just needs descriptions in simple English, along with a few examples for it comprehend and start working.

GPT-3 can write (including long-form generative text), translate, comprehend text, answer closed book questions, reason common tasks, and code.

Training and learning

The examples provided during a task, help in programming the API, while the success generally varies depending on the complexity of the task, according to OpenAI.

The API’s performance can be improved for certain tasks by training model on a dataset of examples provided by the user, or by learning from human feedback.

GPT-3 is trained on Microsoft cloud’s AI supercomputer with various datasets, which consist of text either posted or uploaded on the internet.

The internet data includes a version of the Common Crawl dataset, an expanded version of the WebText dataset, two internet-based book databases, and English-language Wikipedia.

For the model’s contextual learning, it has been trained to predict answer with only a description of the task, without any examples, with just one example of the task, or by providing few examples.

Limitations and possibilities

According to OpenAI, GPT-3 has the tendency to express incorrect text information confidently, and it can provide reasonable output when given inputs are similar to the ones present in its training data.

Also Read Microsoft to skill 10 lakh Indian students in Artificial Intelligence

The training data mostly has texts in English, meaning the model is best suited for classifying, searching, summarising, or generating in that language.

So, when working with inputs from non-English languages, and certain dialects of English that are not as well-described in training data, the model’s performance may vary.

The API can be integrated into a particular product, or used to develop an entirely new application. As it provides a general-purpose “text in, text out” interface, users could try it on virtually any English language task.

OpenAI also expects the model to be used by researchers to better understand the behaviours, capabilities, biases, and constraints of large-scale language models.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/p2mndu/article32782736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AI,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/microsoft-gets-exclusive-license-to-use-gpt-3-language-model-what-does-the-model-mean/article32782848.ece
6,2020/10/06,Musk's SpaceX wins Pentagon award for missile tracking satellites,"SpaceX, known for its reusable rockets and astronaut capsules, is ramping up satellite production for Starlink, a growing constellation of hundreds of internet-beaming satellites.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Elon Musk's SpaceX won a $149 million contract to build missile-tracking satellites for the Pentagon, the U.S. Space Development Agency (SDA) said on Monday, in the company's first government contract to build satellites.

SpaceX, known for its reusable rockets and astronaut capsules, is ramping up satellite production for Starlink, a growing constellation of hundreds of internet-beaming satellites that chief executive Elon Musk hopes will generate enough revenue to help fund SpaceXs interplanetary goals.

Under the SDA contract, SpaceX will use its Starlink assembly plant in Redmond, Washington, to build four satellites fitted with a wide-angle infrared missile-tracking sensor supplied by a subcontractor, an SDA official said.

Technology company L3 Harris Technologies Inc., formerly Harris Corporation, received $193 million to build another four satellites. Both companies are expected to deliver the satellites for launch by fall 2022.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

The U.S. House of Representatives antitrust report on Big Tech firms contains a “thinly veiled call to break up” the companies, Republican Congressman Ken Buck said in a draft response seen by Reuters.

The House antitrust subcommittee is expected to publish its report this week on Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Google owner Alphabet Inc.

A Buck representative confirmed to Reuters the authenticity of the draft response, which was first reported by Politico.

In the draft, Buck said he shared Democratic concerns about the power of Big Tech firms, with their penchant for “killer acquisitions” to eliminate rivals and self-preferencing in guiding customers to their other products.

However, he objected to a plan to require them to delineate a clear “single line of business”. Social media platform Facebook also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, search engine provider Google's businesses include YouTube and Android, and e-commerce leader Amazon operates a massive cloud computing unit.

“This proposal is a thinly veiled call to break up Big Tech firms. We do not agree with the majority's approach,” Buck wrote.

It is not yet known how many Republicans will support the report, which is being led by Democratic Chairman David Cicilline. Reports and recommendations with bipartisan support usually have a bigger impact.

“The report offers a chilling look into how Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook have used their power to control how we see and understand the world,” Buck wrote.

He agreed with some of the report's recommendations, such as making it easier for the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to stop mergers by lowering their burden of proof, and allowing consumers to take control of their data through data portability and interoperability between platforms.

“These potential changes need not be dramatic to be effective,” Buck wrote.

Brazilian ride-hailing service 99, controlled by China's Didi Chuxing Technology Co Ltd, has partnered with WhatsApp to accept orders on the chat platform owned by Facebook in a move that would allow users to summon cars without using another app.

The partnership is the first of its kind in the world for Didi, China's biggest ride-hailing company, the companies said, and could give 99 an advantage in competing with U.S.-based Uber Technologies Inc, the market leader in Brazil.

WhatsApp has 120 million active users in Brazil, which has a population of 210 million, making it the app’s second-largest market behind India. 99 has about 20 million customers registered with its app and more than 750 thousand active drivers across Brazil.

Uber declined to comment.

The service, initially limited to four cities in Sŗo Paulo state, will expand to the whole of Brazil by the end of 2020, said Livia Pozzi, operations manager at 99.

The partnership is primarily aimed at low income Brazilians whose smartphones have less capacity to download apps, and people who live in regions whose mobile phone signals are weaker, she said.

“It will allow access to the service for a larger universe of people who will no longer need to download our app to order their rides,” Pozzi said.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Half of the young women techies in the US quit their jobs by the age of 35, discouraged by non-inclusive work culture, according to a survey by consulting firm Accenture.

“Women who leave tech roles in the workforce, or who are likely to leave in the near future, identify a non-inclusive company culture as the major driver,” the report titled ‘Resetting Tech Culture’ said.

The report recommends factors like diverse and bold leadership, respect and encouragement, flexibility in work timing and location can help retain women in the technology jobs.

Some companies have ramped up their efforts to reduce the gender bias, it noted.

The study also said two thirds of all those it surveyed felt industry leaders have failed to create empowering workplaces where people have a sense of belonging.

This is evident from the fact that the proportion of women techies have declined to 32% in 2020, from 35% in 1984.

Accenture estimates computing roles in the U.S. have grown 10 times faster than the average growth of all job roles, in the last three decades. The demand for cybersecurity experts in the U.S. surged 50% in 5 years to more than 3 lakh skilled workforce required.

The research shows that providing an inclusive work environment without a gender bias would bring more women into the burgeoning field.

This will also mitigate problems such as algorithmic or product design bias, which inevitably creeps in due to lack of diversity.

It can also help narrow the gender pay gap.

The invasion that followed those October 7, 2001 strikes quickly toppled the militants, who had harboured the Al-Qaeda, the group behind the September 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in America just weeks earlier.

Now, 19 years since the collapse of their brutal Islamist regime, the Taliban is pushing for a return to power, having signed a landmark troop withdrawal deal with Washington in February and currently holding peace talks with the Afghan government.

Fearful that the Taliban has changed little since the darkest days of its regime — when it killed women accused of adultery, attacked minority religious groups and barred girls from going to school — many Afghans worry about a new era of Taliban influence.

“I remember the Taliban regime like a nightmare. We are scared for our future and my daughter’s future,” said Kabul resident Katayoun Ahmadi, a 26-year-old mother.

She recalled seeing severed hands and fingers on Kabul’s streets following amputations for petty crimes under the Taliban’s strict interpretation of Sharia law.

Enduring improvements

The 2001 invasion heralded some enduring improvements for young Afghans — particularly girls — and ushered in a Constitution guaranteeing certain freedoms, including the right to education.

But so far in peace talks in Doha, which started last month, the Taliban has said little about issues such as women’s rights or freedom of expression.

Ms. Ahmadi’s husband Farzad Farnood, 35, a researcher for the Afghanistan Institute for Strategic Studies, said a rise in Taliban violence since a deal was signed between the hardline group and Washington shows the militants have not changed. “Is this creating hope for Afghans? No, it is not,” he said.

As a teenager, he witnessed the Taliban stoning a woman to death and public executions and floggings in Kabul’s football stadium. His family had to hide their black-and-white television’s antenna in a tree when the Taliban banned music and entertainment. “All the achievements we have made in the last 18 years did not exist in the Taliban era.”

Zia-ul-Rahman, a former insurgent, said the Taliban was pushing for “the establishment of an Islamic system”, even though the Constitution already gives primacy to the religion. “We have no problem with girls getting an education or women working, but they have to wear a hijab,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wryi9x/article32785547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THRDTALIBAN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/as-peace-talks-continue-afghans-fear-return-of-taliban/article32785548.ece
15,2020/10/06,Kim orders 80-day ‘battle’ to boost economy,"North Korea has been battered by the pandemic

North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has ordered a nationwide drive to boost the ailing economy ahead of a key party congress in January, state media reported on Tuesday.

The decision was made during a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party and comes as the coronavirus pandemic and recent floods have added yet more pressure on the isolated country's flagging economy.

Mandatory mass mobilisation drives, featuring extra-long work hours and additional duties, are commonplace in North Korea in the lead-up to major events.

Measure of loyalty

The efforts have usually been dubbed “Battles” — the North often embraces militaristic terminology and notions of struggle — but while the official KCNA news agency described it as such in Korean, in its English version it used the more diplomatic term “campaign”.

“We have performed historical feats with our costly efforts, boldly overcoming unprecedentedly grave trials and difficulties this year, but we should not rest on our laurels,” it said.

“We still face the challenges that cannot be overlooked and there are many goals we have to attain within this year.”

Participation in the exhausting “battles” is rigorously monitored and used as a measure of loyalty to the regime, with past campaigns denounced by rights groups as exercises in forced labour.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mni974/article32785488.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THRDKIM1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kim-orders-80-day-battle-to-boost-economy/article32785489.ece
16,2020/10/06,Ahmed Adeeb gets 20 years for corruption,"Former Maldives Vice-President pleads guilty

Maldives former Vice-President Ahmed Adeeb has been sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to graft, money laundering and abuse of power, court officials said on Tuesday.

Adeeb was a close ally of ex-President Abdulla Yameen until Adeeb was jailed for allegedly trying to assassinate the strongman former ruler with a bomb on board his yacht in 2015.

The Criminal Court in an overnight decision also imposed a fine of two million rufiyaa ($129,000) for Adeeb’s role in siphoning money from the state tourism promoter during the former administration.

He was accused of causing a loss of about $260 million to the state in leasing islets for resort development and receiving kickbacks from tourism companies.

Adeeb’s then boss, Yameen, is already serving a five-year prison sentence for money laundering during his tenure between 2013 and 2018.

“Adeeb cooperated with the state in the investigation and entered a plea deal,” a court official said adding that the 20-year sentence was a “light punishment” for the crimes he admitted to.

In July, Adeeb had been cleared of the charges by the Criminal Court, but prosecutors appealed to the High Court which ordered a fresh trial.

Adeeb was initially Tourism Minister and promoted to Vice-President by Yameen, but the two later fell out. He was jailed for 15 years after being accused of trying to assassinate Yameen following a September 2015 explosion aboard the presidential yacht. However, Adeeb was cleared of the attempted assassination charge after Yameen’s defeat at the 2018 re-election bid.

17,2020/10/06,Pressure builds for ceasefire as Karabakh fighting rages,"Battles raged between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region on Tuesday, with both sides vowing to pursue the conflict despite increasing international pressure for a ceasefire.

Turkey’s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu landed in Azerbaijan for talks after Russia, the United States and France on Monday called for an “unconditional” halt to the fighting.

Western powers are urging Turkey, a longstanding ally of Azerbaijan, to use its influence with Baku to restore calm after 10 straight days of clashes that have claimed more than 260 lives.

The battles began on September 28 in a long-simmering territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave that broke away from Azerbaijan in the 1990s.

Neither side has shown any inclination to slow hostilities despite a mounting civilian death toll.

Azerbaijan’s Defence Ministry and Karabakh’s Foreign Ministry both said fighting was continuing on several fronts on Tuesday morning.

Both sides continued to claim to have inflicted heavy losses in manpower and equipment, and to accuse each of other of targeting civilian areas.

The conflict has expanded in the past few days with shelling on big cities, including the regional capital Stepanakert and Azerbaijan’s second-largest city, Ganja.

After several days of heavy bombing, Stepanakert was calm on Tuesday. Warning sirens rang out and the city was littered with glass and debris from previous shelling.

Potential ‘war crime’

Armenian Health Minister Arsen Torosyan told reporters near the border that he had seen a rocket landing very close to Stepanakert’s main hospital.

“I’m not ruling out they are deliberately targeting medical facilities, which is a war crime,” he said.

The two sides have reported 265 deaths since the fighting erupted, including more than 45 civilians, but the real total is expected to be much higher. Most of the confirmed deaths are from the Armenian side, which has reported nearly 220 fatalities among separatist fighters. Azerbaijan is not releasing any figures on its military deaths.

Christian-majority Armenia is in a military alliance of former Soviet states led by Russia, which has a permanent base in the country but has not shown any appetite for a military escalation of the conflict.

Turkey is a loyal ally of Azerbaijan, a fellow Muslim and Turkic country, and has been accused of dispatching mercenaries from Syria and Libya to join the fighting.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/r8j9vt/article32785260.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THRDAZERBAIJAN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pressure-builds-for-ceasefire-as-karabakh-fighting-rages/article32785261.ece

19,2020/10/06,Maldives ex-Vice President Ahmed Adeeb jailed again for money laundering,"The Criminal Court also fined Ahmed Adeeb $129,800

The former Vice President of the Maldives has been sentenced to 20 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to money laundering and embezzlement under orders from the former president.

The Criminal Court on Monday night also fined Ahmed Adeeb $129,800. The prison sentence, which will be shortened by one year because he served time after a previous conviction on the same charges, also covered charges of corruption and possession of an unlicensed firearm.

Adeeb was a protege to former President Yameen Abdul Gayoom during the early years of his presidency between 2013 and 2018.

He had been sentenced to 33 years in prison in 2016 for several counts including masterminding a blast in a presidential speedboat in which Yameen’s wife was wounded. He was freed from all charges after Yameen lost re-election in 2018.

Under the new President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, many cases perceived to be politically motivated were revisited.

After his release, Adeeb testified against Yameen in court saying he was party to his former boss’ corrupt dealings and did not worry about being sent to jail again.

Charges were refiled, and Adeeb pleaded guilty to all charges, including money laundering, embezzlement and using his prominent position to gain undue advantage.

Yameen is serving a five-year prison term for having facilitated Adeeb to launder $1 million obtained through corrupt deals.

20,2020/10/06,EU court rules against Hungary's Orban over Soros university,"The Hungarian Prime Minister has been a vocal critic of billionaire-philanthropist George Soros for years, arguing that the he is intent on undermining European values with his liberal views on migration

The European Union’s highest court ruled on Tuesday that changes by Hungary to its law on higher education which effectively forced a university founded by George Soros to leave the country were not in line with EU law.

The European Court of Justice ruled against Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s governing, saying in the ruling that “the conditions introduced by Hungary to enable foreign higher education institutions to carry out their activities in its territory are incompatible with EU law.”

Among the changes, Hungary tied the operation of foreign universities in Hungary to a bilateral agreement between the Hungarian government and the universities’ country of origin. Foreign universities were also compelled to carry out educational activities in their home countries.

The court ruled that by imposing such conditions, “Hungary has failed to comply with the commitments” under the framework of the World Trade Organisation and acted in contravention of the provisions of the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights.

Under such a ruling, the member state is legally forced to immediately comply with the Court’s judgment, and if it refuses, the EU Commission can seek to fine it.

At the heart of the conflict is the fate of Central European University, established in New York state by Mr. Soros, a Hungarian-American financier. Under pressure from Mr. Orban, it had to relocate most of its main activities to Vienna from Budapest, where it had been operating since the early 1990s.

Mr. Orban has been a vocal critic of Mr. Soros for years, arguing that the billionaire philanthropist is intent on undermining European values with his liberal views on migration, claims Mr. Soros has denied. Mr. Orban’s ideological aim of creating an “illiberal state” is also in contrast with Mr. Soros’ ideal of an “open society.”

In light of his views on Mr. Soros, the amendments to the academic rules were widely seen as targeting CEU. The EU Commission launched an infringement procedure in April 2017 against Hungary in the wake of the changes. It subsequently referred Hungary to the Court of Justice in December 2017.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/u5i24c/article32782177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THCENTRALAEUROPEANINSTITUTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eu-court-rules-against-hungarys-orban-over-soros-university/article32782178.ece

22,2020/10/06,Amazon risks changing from forest to savanna: study,"The team used the latest available atmospheric data to simulate how tropical forests might respond to changing rainfall levels.

As much as 40% of the Amazon risks crossing a tipping point from rainforest to savanna as greenhouse gas emissions reduce the rainfall needed to sustain its unique ecosystem, scientists said Monday.

Forests are particularly sensitive to changes that affect rainfall for extended periods, and trees may die off if areas go too long without rain.

This can have significant knock-on effects on nature — with the loss of tropical habitats — as well as the climate as shrinking forests lose their ability to absorb manmade emissions.

It also increases the risk of fire.

A team of Europe-based scientists used the latest available atmospheric data to simulate how tropical forests might respond to changing rainfall levels.

In particular, they simulated the effect of continued emissions from burning fossil fuels between now and the end of the century.

They found that rainfall in the Amazon is so low already that up to 40% of it risks tipping over into a savanna-like environment, with far fewer trees and far less biodiversity.

Lead author Arie Staal, from the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said that rainforests normally create their own rainfall through water vapour, sustaining tree levels and even extending their reach. But the inverse is also true: when precipitation levels fall, the forests begin to disappear. “As forests shrink, we get less rainfall downwind and this causes drying, leading to more fire and forest loss: a vicious cycle,” Staal said.

Species 'forever lost'

The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, explored the resilience of tropical rainforests under two additional extreme scenarios.

In the first, researchers looked at how fast the world's forests would grow back if they suddenly disappeared.

The second studied what would happen if rainforests covered all tropical regions on Earth.

They found that many of the world's rainforests would struggle to grow back once lost, leading to a far wider savanna-like mix of woodland and grassland.

In addition to the Amazon loss, the team found that the forest in the Congo basin was at risk of changing to savanna, and that large swathes would not grow back once gone.

“We understand now that rainforests on all continents are very sensitive to global change and can rapidly lose their ability to adapt,” said Ingo Fetzer, also from the Stockholm Resilience Centre. “Once gone, their recovery will take many decades to return to their original state...And given that rainforests host the majority of all global species, all this will be forever lost.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/10ipwe/article32780105.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-AMAZON-FOREST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/amazon-risks-changing-from-forest-to-savanna-study/article32780106.ece

Albania’s Parliament on Monday approved electoral law changes designed to prevent vote manipulation, which is a key condition for the country to start negotiations to join the European Union. The new electoral code will apply from next year’s scheduled April 25 parliamentary election.

Lawmakers present in the 140-seat house voted 97-15 in favor of the amendments and 5 abstained.

They also selected new officials at the country’s top electoral commission.

Changes include a 1 percent threshold for political parties to enter parliament.

Post-communist Albania’s elections have always been contested and marred by irregularities, including alleged vote-buying and manipulation of ballot counts.

The electoral reform followed recommendations from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has monitored the country’s elections.

Albania’s Parliament is now dominated by the left-wing Socialist Party.

The main center-right opposition, which boycotted parliament last year, criticised the new electoral code.

China and 25 other nations countries on Monday called for the immediate lifting of sanctions by the United States and Western countries to ensure an effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Speaking on behalf of the 26 countries at a meeting of the U.N. General Assembly’s human rights committee, China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said “unilateral coercive measures” violate the U.N. Charter, multilateralism, and impede human rights by hindering “the well-being of the population in the affected countries” and undermining the right to health.

""Global solidarity and international cooperation are the most powerful weapons in fighting and overcoming COVID-19,” the joint statement said. “We seize this opportunity to call for the complete and immediate lifting of unilateral coercive measures, in order to ensure the full, effective and efficient response of all members of the international community to COVID-19.”

Among the countries that backed the statement were half a dozen that face sanctions by the United States, European Union or other Western nations including Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Russia, Syria and Venezuela.

The statement notes that both U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet have called for the waiving of sanctions that undermine a country’s capacity to respond to the pandemic.

There was no immediate response to an email seeking comment from the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.

Germany’s U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen addressed the sanctions issue at a Security Council meeting on Syria in May saying EU sanctions “do not affect the delivery of humanitarian aid or medical goods to limit the effects of COVID-19,” citing specific EU guidance on ensuring aid gets to the Syrian people.

The 26 countries also took aim at “chronic and deep-rooted racial discrimination, police brutality and social inequality.”

They cited the shooting by police of two Black Americans, George Floyd who died at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis in May, and Jacob Blake, shot by a white police officer in August and left paralyzed from the waist down.

25,2020/10/06,Coronavirus | White House nixes tougher FDA guidelines on vaccine approval,"A senior administration confirmed the move Monday evening, saying the White House believed there was no clinical or medical reason to add additional screening protocols.

The White House has blocked new Food and Drug Administration guidelines on bringing potential vaccines for COVID-19 to market that would almost certainly have prevented their approval before the Nov 3 election.

Also read: Donald Trump, likely still contagious, back at White House

At issue was the FDA’s planned requirement that participants in the ongoing mass clinical trials for nearly a half-dozen vaccine candidates be followed for two months to ensure there are no side effects and that the vaccines provide lasting protection from the virus in order to receive emergency approval.

A senior administration confirmed the move Monday evening, saying the White House believed there was no clinical or medical reason to add additional screening protocols.

Also read: U.S. to buy 100 million doses of vaccine

The White House action was first reported by The New York Times.

FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has pledged that career scientists, not politicians, will decide whether any coronavirus vaccine meets clearly stated standards that it works and is safe. Vaccine development usually takes years, but scientists have been racing to shorten that time.

“Science will guide our decisions. FDA will not permit any pressure from anyone to change that, Mr. Hahn said recently.

“I will put the interest of the American people above anything else”, he said.

The FDA has faced criticism for allowing emergency use of some COVID-19 treatments backed by little evidence, but Hahn has said if vaccine makers want that faster path to market, they would face additional standards. Vaccines, unlike therapies, are given to healthy people and thus usually require more proof.

But President Donald Trump made clear last month that he was skeptical of any regulatory changes that might delay a vaccine’s authorisation, even if those changes are aimed at increasing public trust. Asked about the FDA considering stricter guidelines for emergency approval, Mr. Trump suggested the effort was politically motivated.

“I think that was a political move more than anything else, he said then, arguing that that the companies testing the vaccines, such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna, are capable of determining whether they work.

“I have tremendous trust in these massive companies,” he said.

27,2020/10/06,Serbia President: Prime Minister to remain in office,"The decision paves the way for the formation of a new government more than three months after a parliamentary election.

Serbia’s President on Monday proposed that current Prime Minister Ana Brnabic stay in office, paving the way for the formation of a new government more than three months after a parliamentary election.

Autocratic leader Aleksandar Vucic announced his choice at a news conference that followed a meeting of his populist Serbian Progressive Party, which won an overwhelming majority in the June 21 vote.

“I hold Ana Brnabic in very high regard”, he said.

The June balloting in Serbia was the first held in Europe after the coronavirus outbreak. Serbia’s authorities have faced criticism for abolishing most anti-virus measures before the vote, which led to a surge in new infections.

Many Serbian opposition groups boycotted the June vote, saying that it wasn’t free and fair because of the ruling party’s tight grip on mainstream media and pressure on dissent.

Two decades ago, Serbia ousted in a popular uprising then-autocratic leader Slobodan Milosevic after years of wars and international sanctions. Critics of Vucic, a former Milosevic-era government minister, accuse him of clamping down on hard-won democratic freedoms. He has denied this.

Brnabic became Serbia’s first female and openly gay prime minister in 2017, after Vucic resigned the post in order to take part in a presidential election.

Brnabic’s government formally seeks European Union membership while also maintaining close ties with Russia and China.

28,2020/10/06,"Coronavirus | Donald Trump, likely still contagious, back at White House","The President left Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre, disembarked from Presidential chopper Marine One, took off his mask and posed for photos

Just three nights after he was hospitalized for COVID-19, U.S. President Donald Trump, who likely is still contagious with COVID-19, left the hospital and returned to the White House. As the national death toll from the virus reached 210,000, Mr. Trump told Americans not to be “afraid” of COVID and let it “dominate” their lives.

Mr Trump , who was restless — as to a normal life through most of his stay at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, released vidoes , took a ride in his limousine and sent out a tweet storm of campaign style messages before he was discharged on Monday evening. Just before he left the hospital, Mr Trump announced on Twitter that he would be back on the campaign trail soon.

The President’s treatment includes a drug that can cause temporary boosts in energy levels — the steroid dexamethasone, in addition to remdesivir and a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies.

Mr Trump — who was given special access to this experimental antibody cocktail — told other Americans, many of whom are told to recover at home if they have the disease, that they should not be scared of the disease: messaging that was criticized widely.

“ I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Centre today at 6:30 p.m. Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!” Mr Trump tweeted on Monday.

“…Many people of privilege have options in deciding how much they worry about covid. But the vast majority of worse-off people does not have this luxury. Covid-related unemployment, illness and death are much higher among worse-off people, and especially minorities, “ Harald Schmidt, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, told The Hindu.

“Belittling peoples justified worries, or encouraging them to let their guard down is the last thing we need right now,” Mr Schmidt said, citing the COVID death toll.

Alighting from the presidential chopper, Marine One, after his ten minute flight back home, the president took off his mask as he posed for photos between American flags on the balcony of the White House, which has itself become a hotspot for the virus.

“The scientific evidence is clear, masks save lives. The president certainly has a sense for effective photo-opps, but the signal is exactly the wrong one,” Mr Schmidt said.

In addition to First Lady Melania Trump and a number of others in Mr Trump’s circle, On Monday

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced on Monday that she had tested positive for the coronavirus. Two of her aides have also been infected as per CNN. Three journalists of the White House Press Corps had also been infected. A number of Mr Trump’s inner circle, including the First Lady Melania Trump have tested positive since last week.

Later on Monday evening, Mr Trump released a video that reiterated his message about not letting the virus dominate life.

“I stood out front, I led,” Mr Trump said about his experience of the past few days. “Nobody that’s a leader would not do what I did. I know there’s a risk, there’s a danger, but that’s okay,” he said.

On Sunday , while still hospitalized and infectious, Mr Trump – wearing what appeared to be a cloth mask- took a short ride in the presidential limousine with secret service agents in the vehicle and the windows up. The president was criticized by doctors as well as former secret service agents for needlessly exposing agents to the virus.

Mr Trump and the Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, have taken sharply contrasting approaches to the disease — both in terms of policy as well as personal behaviour . Earlier on Monday, a video of former Second Lady Jill Biden was published , in which could be seen pulling her husband Mr Biden back from a gaggle of reporters on the tarmac at New Castle airport, in Delaware. Mr Biden also tweeted about the importance of masks and following scientific advice in response to Monday’s tweet-storm from the president.

“Now that President Trump is busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists. Support masks. Support mask mandates nationwide,” Mr Biden wrote.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8d1fdk/article32778335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DONALDKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-donald-trump-likely-still-contagious-back-at-white-house/article32778336.ece
29,2020/10/06,Biden urges Trump to support nationwide mask mandate,"Requesting Mr Trump to support a nationwide mandate that requires masks in every federal building and facility, Mr Biden said, “Urge every governor and mayor to do the same. We know it saves lives.’

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Monday urged President Donald Trump to support a nationwide mask mandate to effectively launch a fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

“My prayers continue to be with the president and the First Lady for their health and safety as they are like so many American families who are dealing with COVID-19,” Mr Biden said at a campaign event in the swing state of Florida.

Last Thursday, Mr Trump and First Lady Melania Trump tested positive for COVID-19. The president was admitted to a military hospital for necessary treatment.

“I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend. Now that he’s busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this - listen to scientists. Support masks,” Mr Biden said hours before Trump is scheduled to be discharged from the hospital.

Requesting Mr Trump to support a nationwide mandate that requires masks in every federal building and facility, Mr Biden said, “Urge every governor and mayor to do the same. We know it saves lives.”

“His administration just rejected a mask mandate for public transportation on Friday. I believe that was wrong and not very rational,” the former vice president added.

Mr Biden, who as per latest polls, has widened his lead over Mr Trump by double digits, has been an ardent advocate of making masks mandatory nationwide.

This he argues will save a lot of lives.

Experts say that universal masking could have saved 100000 lives between now and January, he said.

“You know I backed that mandate months ago; he should back it now,” Mr Biden said.

Since the President entered the hospital on Friday, more than 100,000 people have been diagnosed with COVID and this week at least 5,000 more will die in many States. I hope the president’s recovery is swift and successful but our nation’s COVID-19 crisis is far far from over, he added.

Nearly 210,000 Americans have died due to the virus so far with about 7.5 million contracting the infection.

Hispanic communities

This pandemic and the economic collapse have hit the Hispanic communities hard, Mr Biden said.

Mr Biden said some economists are calling this a K-shaped recovery.

“It means essential workers, so many of whom are Hispanic who have sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic, are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in the modern American history,” Mr Biden said.

While workers are struggling, it’s true the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well, making an additional USD300 billion since the COVID-19 broke out, said the former vice president.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4yh3bj/article32778161.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIDENKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/biden-urges-trump-to-support-nationwide-mask-mandate/article32778162.ece

An Israeli aircraft struck what the army said was a Hamas military target in the southern Gaza Strip late on Monday, shortly after Gaza militants fired a rocket into Israel.

The rocket landed in an open area and did not cause any damage or injuries, Israeli media reported. But it broke a weekslong lull in the area.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the rocket fire.

But Israel holds Gaza’s Hamas rulers responsible for all fire out of the territory and usually responds to rocket attacks with airstrikes on Hamas targets. There were no reports of casualties from the Israeli airstrike.

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, meanwhile, the Israeli army said it opened fire at three Palestinian men who were throwing firebombs at troops near the settlement of Einav.

It said one of the suspects was hit, while the two others managed to flee.

U.S. President Donald Trump has met or exceeded all standard hospital criteria to be discharged, and while he is not yet out of the woods, he is able to go home, his physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said on Monday.

“Over the past 24 hours... he's met or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria,” Dr. Conley told a news conference, saying it had been more than 72 hours since Mr. Trump's last fever and that his oxygen levels were normal.

“Though he may not entirely be out of the woods yet, the team and I agree that all our evaluations, and most importantly, his clinical status, support the president's safe return home, where he will be surrounded by world-class medical care 24/7,” said Dr. Conley.

Donald Trump says ""don't afraid of Covid""

President Donald Trump said he felt “really good” and will leave a military hospital where he is being treated for COVID-19 later on Monday, despite a wave of infections that have hit his White House four weeks before the U.S. election.

Mr. Trump, who announced on Friday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus and was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre outside Washington later that day, said he would leave the facility at 6:30 p.m. EDT (2230 GMT).

“I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Centre today at 6:30 p.m. Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!” he said on Twitter.

Mr. Trump, 74, was running a high fever and was given supplemental oxygen after his blood oxygen levels dropped on Friday, according to his White House physician, Dr. Sean P. Conley. Doctors have been treating him with a steroid, dexmethasone, that is normally used only in the most severe cases.

Dr. Conley is due to provide an update on the Republican president's condition at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT), a White House official said.

He is expected to contest on LJP ticket from the Dinara constituency in the upcoming Assembly elections.

In the last two Assembly elections in 2010 and 2015, this seat was held by JD(U)’s Jai Kumar Singh. This time too, sources said, that it was expected that in the seat division between the BJP and the JD(U), it would once again go into the latter’s account.

The LJP has opened doors for all the BJP candidates who could not be accommodated because of the seat distribution between the JD(U) and the BJP. Sources said that many other BJP leaders were in touch with the LJP and would join in soon.

Earlier in an open letter, LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan had said that all the winning candidates of the LJP would support the BJP to form the next government in Bihar.

“As the Mahila Congress president, I have absolutely no hesitation in saying that I am totally against anybody being given a nomination who has been accused of any serious moral turpitude.

After several rounds of talks, the major NDA partners in Bihar — JD(U) and BJP — on Tuesday announced a seat-sharing formula for the upcoming Assembly election. The JD(U) will contest 122 seats while the BJP fight on one seat less at 121 for the 243-member Assembly.

“The JD(U) will contest on 122 seats and give seven seats out of it to the alliance partner Jitan Ram Manjhi-led Hindustani Awam Morcha (secular) and BJP would contest on 121 seats while accommodating the Vikashil Insaan Party from its own quota,” JD(U) president and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar announced at a crowded joint press meet along with BJP leaders.

Stating that there was no confusion in the NDA in Bihar, Mr. Kumar said, “We’ve been working since long to make Bihar a saksham (capable) State and will keep working for it.”

When asked about another NDA ally, the Lok Janshakti Party’s very aggressive stand on the JD(U), Mr. Kumar said, “I do not have to say anything on who says what…people have got freedom to speak.”

“Though LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan is indisposed these days and in hospital but, may I ask, could he go to the Rajya Sabha without any support of the JD(U),” asked Mr. Kumar.

Later, senior State BJP leader and Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi reiterated what the party’s state chief Sanjay Jaiswal had told media persons ahead of the press-meet that “those who will not accept Nitish Kumar’s leadership, would not be a part of NDA in Bihar.”

“Nitish Kumar is the face of NDA in Bihar poll and he will be the CM face of NDA as well”, he asserted while, adding, “I would request to media as well that there should not be any confusion over it.”

Mr. Sushil Modi, who is known to be close to Mr. Kumar, further said, “If needed we would write and request the Election Commission also that no other party, except we four — BJP, JD(U), HAM(S) and VIP — should be allowed to use pictures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi during poll.”

However, even as BJP leader reiterated that Mr Kumar would lead the alliance into the poll, LJP president Chirag Paswan tweeted: “Soon after government formation in Bihar there will be an investigation into corruption in the Saat Nischay (seven resolutions) programme and all guilty will be sent to jail…and pending amount will be released soon so that unfinished work will also be done.” The Saat Nischay programme is an ambitious development programme helmed by Mr. Kumar.

The remarks come ahead of the announcement on seat sharing between the BJP and JD(U) expected later in the evening. The BJP and JD(U) are likely to contest on 121 and 122 seats respectively for the 243-member Assembly.

Earlier, Mr. Jaiswal along with BJP leaders — Deputy chief minister Sushil Modi, State party in-charge Bhupendra Yadav and poll in-charge Devendra Fadnavis — met Mr. Kumar for over an hour at his official residence at 1, Anne Marg.

Mr. Jaiswal’s statement is seen as an attempt to assuage Mr. Kumar against another NDA ally, Lok Janshakti Party chief Chirag Paswan’s strident attack. Mr. Paswan has declared his party will field candidates against JD(U) nominees but, “will be with the BJP”.

Mr. Paswan on Monday had also appealed to the people of Bihar not to vote for the JD(U) as it would force their children to migrate.

36,2020/10/06,Malayali filmmaker Jay Janardhan’s Australian comedy series ‘Howdy’ is all about multiculturalism,"The pilot episode of ‘Howdy’, which features an Australian cast, releases on Zee5 on October 7

The life of an immigrant in Australia is something Thiruvananthapuram-born filmmaker Jay Janardhan knows by experience. Having landed in Brisbane in 2002 to study engineering, he has since made the Australian city his base. After working as an engineer there for a few years, he enrolled in the Queensland School of Film and Television to follow his passion. Now, Jay's Australian comedy drama series Howdy, which revolves around the theme of multi-culturalism, is set to release on OTT platform Zee5 on October 7.

""Multiculturalism and racial diversity are much talked-about in Australia, even more so now. Often, they are quite sensitive topics too. Many migrants take their time to get used to the new life but it is also an exciting phase. Howdy attempts a droll take on this,"" says Jay from Thiruvananthapuram.

The series features a cast based in Australia. ""Howdy follows the goof-ups of a local millionaire, played by theatre actor Shaun King, who loses his fortune and is now down and out. He is forced to move in with three migrants and share their common residence. One of them is a Malayali, played by Thiruvananthapuram-born actor Naveen Simone who is settled in Brisbane. Another is a Chinese guy and the third, an Afghan. We get to see the vast cultural differences between the characters and how they cope with each other,"" says Jay.

The script of Howdy, which has eight episodes, is written by Australian author Dirk Flinthart. Jay says he went for comedy as he felt that it was a good medium to handle such a theme.

The shooting, done entirely in Brisbane, had been completed last year and Jay moved to Kerala to work on an independent Malayalam project. Then the pandemic struck and the post-production of Howdy was completed during the lockdown period. ""That was challenging as the crew were based in different cities. I was in Thiruvananthapuram while my editor, Christy Sebastian (Stand-up, Mangalyam Thanthunanena) was in Mumbai,"" says Jay.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hbbo0i/article32782988.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tvmHowdycast,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/malayali-filmmaker-jay-janardhans-australian-comedy-series-howdy-is-all-about-multiculturalism/article32782990.ece

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

In 2020, owing to the coronavirus-induced lockdowns which sees many of us home-bound, online activity has seen considerable surges across different types of devices (mobile phones, laptops, smart televisions, tablets and more) in a mission to stay informed and entertained.

Naturally, hackers have also honed in on this trend, closely following consumer behaviour to undertake online scams.

Each year, a device to cloud cybersecurity company McAfee comes out with a list of top 10 celebrities which generate the riskiest search results online, wherein malicious sites and viruses are linked to these big names. For the 14th edition, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has topped McAfee’s ‘Most Dangerous Celebrity List 2020.’ McAfee’s research shows this highly searched-for soccer star is the most ‘dangerous’ celebrity to search for this year because his name generates the most harmful links online.

Trailing Ronaldo as the second-most dangerous celebrity in this context is veteran actor Tabu. Following her is Taapsee Pannu, then come Anushka Sharma and Sonakshi Sinha.

Young musician Armaan Malik follows, with Sara Ali Khan closely behind. Soap actor Divyanka Tripathi ranks next and then comes Shah Rukh Khan. The list is rounded out by playback singer Arijit Singh.

The risks

“As consumers scout the web for free entertainment now more than ever, cybercriminals trail close behind, capitalising on this interest,” says Venkat Krishnapur, VP of Engineering and MD at McAfee India, in a company statement, “Unsuspecting users often look for free and pirated content such as major sports events, movies, TV shows, along with images and leaked videos of their favourite celebs. Bad actors leverage consumers’ fascination with pop culture and drive unsuspecting fans to malicious websites that install malware on their devices, potentially putting personal information at risk.”

Krishnapur continues, “When consumers compromise on security in favour of convenience and freebies, they put their digital lives at risk. It is vital that fans stay vigilant, avoid suspicious links that promise free content and think twice before clicking.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/pw1n69/article32773727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06NET-MCAFEE-SRK,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/mcafee-14th-edition-most-dangerous-celebrity-list-2020-shah-rukh-khan-armaan-malik-cristiano-ronaldo/article32773728.ece

Procurement of two VVIP planes was started under the UPA regime, said government sources after Congress leader Rahul Gandi raked the issue of “luxury planes worth ₹8,000 crore” for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Also read: First plane for the exclusive use of VVIPs lands in Delhi

The sources said the UPA held 10 meetings over a span of a year to decide on the acquisition of the two VVIP planes between 2011 and 2012 and the NDA-1 and 2 merely brought their decision to a logical conclusion.

“The process of acquisition of two new aircraft for the travel of VVIPs commenced in 2011 when upon the direction of the Group of Ministers (GoM), a meeting of Committee of Secretaries (CoS) was held wherein it was decided that an Inter-Ministerial Group (IMG) would examine the available options for long-term arrangement of VVIP aircraft,” sources said.

Following which, an Inter-Ministerial Group (IMG) coordinated by the Cabinet Secretariat was set up to decide on acquisition, management and utilisation of the aircraft.

The IMG also considered two options before it — either convert an existing B777 ER or use one of the new ones ordered by Air India.

Several farmers outfits under the banner of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee held a protest rally in Sirsa after which a group of farmers had ‘marched’ towards Mr. Chautala’s residence even as various routes leading to it were sealed by the police.

“There was no clash with farmers. We had to use water cannons and tear gas, after the agitators broke the first of the two-layer barricades that were erected on roads leading to the Dy. CM’s house. They were about to break the second layer, following which we were compelled to use water and tear gas,” Bhupender Singh, SP, Sirsa, told The Hindu.

“The protesters even pelted stones. The situation was soon brought under control. In the entire incident there were no injuries either to any police personnel or the protesters,” he said.

Agitated farmers raised slogans against the Centre and the State government, terming the laws “anti-farmers’’, and demanded Mr. Chautala to withdraw from the coalition with the BJP in the State government by resigning from his post. Mr. Chautala of the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) has defended the laws as “pro-farmers”.

“Our protest was aimed at pressuring Dushyant Chautala to stand with farmers against the laws and quit from his post. The police tried to stop the farmers a few meters away from his residence. The police had heavily barricaded the roads leading to his house. They lobbed tear gas shells, used water cannon when the farmers tried to go past the barricades to lay siege to the residence of Mr. Chautala,” said Phool Singh Sheokand, president, Haryana Kisan Sabha.

Inderjit Singh, a farmer leader associated with the AIKSCC, said the resistance of the farmers will continue the agitation jointly with other sections till the three-anti people legislations are annulled.

Directly criticising China for the coronavirus crisis as well as for its actions in the Indo-Pacific region, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for the Quadrilateral dialogue, or “Quad”, to “collaborate” in countering China.

At a meeting in Tokyo of the four-nation grouping, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne, Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Mr. Pompeo agreed to make the Quad ministerial meeting an annual event.

Also read: “Likeminded” countries should coordinate fight against COVID-19, says Jaishankar at Quad

Mr. Pompeo also made a specific reference to the India-China standoff at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the “Himalayas”, as well as regional tensions with China .

The remarks prompted a reaction from Beijing, which dubbed the Quad an “anti-China coalition” and an “exclusive clique”.

“As partners in this Quad, it is more critical now than ever that we collaborate to protect our people and partners from the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) exploitation, corruption, and coercion,” said Mr. Pompeo in his initial remarks.

“We’ve seen it in the South, in the East China Sea, the Mekong, the Himalayas, the Taiwan Straits. These are just a few examples,” he added.

Mr. Pompeo also blamed the CCP for a “coverup” of the COVID pandemic, and accused its “authoritarian” regime of “silencing” citizens who raised the alarm.

Also read: Realism should shape India’s China policy: Jaishankar

Within hours of the meeting, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded. “Instead of targeting third parties or undermining their interests, cooperation should be conducive to mutual understanding and trust between regional countries,” said a statement issued in Beijing.

Besides the U.S., none of the other Quad members referred to China directly, and nor did the separate readouts of the meeting issued in Washington, Delhi, Tokyo, Canberra.

A press release issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs after the meeting and ministerial dinner said the ministers had “exchanged views on the regional situation in North Korea, the East China Sea and the South China Sea”, but made no reference to China or the LAC standoff.

In his speech, Mr. Jaishankar spoke of the shared commitments that Quad members have “as vibrant and pluralistic democracies with shared values” towards upholding the rules-based international order, underpinned by the rule of law, transparency, freedom of navigation in the international seas, respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty and peaceful resolution of disputes.” He also stressed that as a member of the UN Security Council next year, India would push for “collective solutions” to global challenges like the pandemic, and for UN reform.

Ms. Payne said the Quad has a “positive agenda” and described it as a “diplomatic network” assisting democracies that believe in a “region governed by rules, not power,” in another oblique reference to Beijing.

Comment | China policy lacks perspicacity

As The Hindu had reported earlier, no statement was issued on whether Australia will be included in this year’s Malabar exercises, but sources said an announcement would be made prior to the naval exercises in November.

An MEA statement said the Quad ministers had discussed responses to the pandemic, including “financial problems”, as well as the need to enhance access to affordable vaccines and medical equipment. They also discussed issues of connectivity, maritime and health security, counter-terrorism, and the supply chain resilience initiative (SCRI) aimed at building regional alternatives in manufacturing and trading.

Earlier in the day, all four Quadrilateral ministers called on the new Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.

Mr. Jaishankar said he had “spoken about the bilateral and global dimensions of our special partnership,” with Mr. Suga, and in his speech Mr. Jaishankar paid a tribute to former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who had first promoted the idea of the Quad, that had grown out of their disaster relief operations during the 2005 Tsunami in the Indo-Pacific.

Mr. Jaishankar also held a bilateral meeting with Mr. Pompeo, who is due to travel to Delhi later this month along with U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper for the “2+2” meeting.

52,2020/10/06,"Home Ministry meeting on GTA sparks speculation, confusion in Darjeeling hills","It shows that the Centre is not serious about finding a political solution, says MLA

Confusion, speculation and also some resentment have prevailed in the Darjeeling hills over a meeting called by the Union Home Minister on the “issues related to Gorkhaland Territorial Administration”. Scheduled on October 7, the representatives of the Centre, officials of the State government and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha have been invited for the tripartite meeting.

The earlier version of the meeting notice issued by the Home Ministry’s Centre State division said “Meeting to discuss issues related to Gorkhaland-reg’. The term Gorkhaland is synonymous to the long-standing demand of a separate State of the people of Darjeeling hills and the reference to Gorkhaland created strong reactions in West Bengal. The Trinamool Congress leadership which has always opposed any talks on Gorkhaland said it was a ploy to divide the State.

The Home Ministry later changed the subject to “issues related to Gorkhaland Territorial Administration”. The GTA is the regional autonomous body formed as a result of the State, Centre and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) tripartite agreement in 2011.

Neeraj Tamang Zimba, who won the Darjeeling Assembly seat on a BJP ticket, told The Hindu that the development has led to “confusion among the people of the hills”.

“It shows that the Centre is not serious about finding a political solution to the Darjeeling hills, the way it is for other long-pending issues like the people of Ladakh and Nagaland,” Mr. Zimba said. The MLA said no public representative in Darjeeling Hills has been invited to the meeting.

It is not certain whether the officials of the State government have extended the invite to the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM). The party has two factions one led by its founder Bimal Gurung and another by Benoy Tamang. While Mr. Gurung had to leave the hills after the violent 100-day statehood stir in 2017, it is the Benoy Tamang faction of the GJM which wields control over the GTA with the support of the Trinamool Congress. Both the factions claim that they represent the party and the matter is also sub judice.

Trinamool Congress leader from Darjeeling district and State Minister Gautam Deb said whenever elections are around, the BJP rakes up the issue of Gorkhaland. “From Trinamool Congress we are very clear that there should be no talks on any subject that leads to the division of Bengal.”

In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP won the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat with a margin of more than 4 lakh votes, highest among all the seats in West Bengal. On Gorkhaland, the BJP has been maintaining a balancing act for more than a decade.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/home-ministry-meeting-on-gta-sparks-speculation-confusion-in-darjeeling-hills/article32784393.ece

A child has to learn his mother tongue to gain a foundation, the Supreme Court accosted Jagan Mohan Reddy-led Andhra government’s logic that children, without learning English, get ‘isolated’.

Also read: Centre for early rollout of mother tongue as medium of instruction

“For foundation, it is very important that a child learns his mother tongue,” Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde addressed senior advocate K.V. Vishwanathan, for the State government.

The Andhra Pradesh government has approached the Supreme Court challenging its State High Court decision to strike down a government order of November 2019 which made English medium education compulsory from classes I to VI in primary, upper primary and high schools under all managements from 2020-21. It was to be gradually extended to each further class from the consequent academic years.

Mr. Vishwanathan vehemently argued that English as the medium of learning has not been imposed on children. The choice of their parents would prevail. The government order is a “progressive measure”.

Also read: Supreme Court rules against imposition of mother tongue in primary schools

He said Dalits, the oppressed, find the State’s move as progressive measure. Vernacular medium of education has its limits. “They have been kept in islands, isolated. The fees [in private English medium schools] are exorbitant,” Mr. Vishwanathan argued.

The senior advocate said even the medium of language in the Supreme Court is English. The State cannot be restrained from taking progressive measures. There is no question of striking down the government order.

But Chief Justice Bobde said there are “huge divergent issues” on the subject which needs to be extensively addressed and decided to hear it next week.

The Union Ministry of Education has already informed the Supreme Court that it is fully backing a push for “mother tongue” as medium of instruction in schools. The use of “home language” for learning will bridge the gap between the intelligentsia and the masses.

Also read: New Education Policy revives debate on medium of instruction

It said an order was issued on September 10 to academic authorities, including CBSE, NCERT and NCTE, to initiate the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP), which was approved by the Union Cabinet in July 2020, to promote ‘mutlingualism’ and use of “home language” as a mode of instruction.

The Centre’s affidavit had come in response to the Supreme Court’s inclination to examine whether imposing English on a multitude of school children, whose language of instruction was their mother tongue, would amount to depriving them of an effective education guaranteed to them under Article 21A (fundamental right to education) of the Constitution.

The younger daughter, he said, was raped by her cousin on September 14. “We came to know about it on September 17 when I was told she had developed an infection in the private parts. I approached the Iglas Kotwali but the SHO refused to lodge a complaint”.

The FIR was finally lodged on September 21 when the condition of the girl deteriorated and was shifted to JN Medical College in Aligarh. “Instead of arresting the accused, the SHO held his brother, a minor and mentally challenged boy, for the crime. He was sent to the juvenile home. We demand the right culprit should be put behind bars and my elder daughter restored to me.”

60,2020/10/06,SC says it’ll ensure smooth probe into Hathras,"Orders U.P. govt to file affidavit on how Hathras case witnesses are being protected

The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would ensure the investigation into alleged gang rape and the torture and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit girl by upper caste Hindus in Hathras would be conducted smoothly.

“We will ensure the investigation part is smooth”, Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, heading three-judge Bench, said.

Hathras gang rape | A long caste feud, a horrific crime, and a sudden cremation

The court ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to file an affidavit, to place it on record, that the witnesses in the case are protected.

“We want it on affidavit on how Hathras case witnesses are protected. We want you to ascertain whether the victim’s family has chosen a lawyer. We want to know the scope of the ongoing proceedings in the case before the Allahabad High Court and how we can widen and make it more relevant”, Chief Justice Bobde addressed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the State government.

‘Horrible and shocking’

The Chief Justice said there was no doubt that what transpired with the victim was “horrible” and “shocking”.

There was no doubt that the case was “extraordinary”, the court said.

The court is hearing a petition filed by Satyam Dubey to transfer the case to the CBI or form a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the case under the supervision of the Supreme Court.

“We are not opposing the petition. But there is narrative after narrative about the incident in the public domain. A young innocent girl has lost her life, let us not sensationalise it. We want a fair and free investigation, we want the investigation to appear free and fair... Please ensure that the investigation is supervised by the Supreme Court”, Mr. Mehta conveyed the stand of the U.P. government.

An affidavit filed by the government said “false narratives gained momentum at the behest of vested interests”. There was a “criminal conspiracy to spread caste conflict and instigate violence”. “Vicious propaganda” was being spread by sections of the media with “oblique motives” and political interests. “Sections of political parties deliberately mislead the public to create communal disharmony”.

The affidavit noted that the government has already formed a SIT and even asked the Centre for a CBI probe into the case.

During the hearing, senior advocate Indira Jaising, seeking an intervention in the case, highlighted the manner in which the victim’s body was cremated in the dead of the night. She said 27 FIRs had been registered against protesters. It was necessary that the the stringent provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act were applied to the four accused persons.

Witness protection

Ms. Jaising highlighted the need for witness protection. “The situation there is very tense”, she submitted. The issue of transfer of the case was wholly within the jurisdiction of the apex court, she said.

Mr. Mehta said the witnesses were already under police protection. “Let us not sensationalise or politicise... I have said the different narratives outside can be stopped only by conducting a fair investigation”, he observed.

Chief Justice Bobde insisted, “But we want it on affidavit that witness protection is in force”.

The court, however, did not take “identical submissions” made mostly by persons wanting to intervene.

Chief Justice Bobde told them,“We are not saying anything about the incident. The incident is horrible, but how can we hear identical arguments? We are not saying you are busybodies, we are only saying a court of law need not hear same arguments by everybody”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6carul/article32765363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-says-itll-ensure-smooth-probe-into-hathras/article32782097.ece

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said it was Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s prerogative to see an “international conspiracy” in the Hathras incident but he “personally sees in it a major tragedy.”

“Yogi Aditynath is entitled to his opinion, he can imagine what he wants, but what I saw was a lovely girl brutalised and killed, and her family threatened and subjugated,” he stated at a press conference in Patiala.

Mr. Gandhi said he saw a tragedy in the incident and Mr. Adityanath should also have had the decency to do so. He said he found it interesting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not uttered a word about the incident, in which ‘a kid was raped and murdered and her whole family was under attack by the administration’.

On FIRs being registered against many Congress workers by police, he said what he and his party men and women suffered was minor compared to what the victim’s family was going through. “They are the ones who have really been pushed around”. It was “no big deal” for him to be pushed around by the cops in U.P.

‘Weak Opposition’

Responding to a question that the Central government was able to take unilateral decisions because of a weak Opposition, he observed, “give me free press and other key institutions and this [NDA] government will not last long.”

He noted that Opposition in any country functioned within a framework, including the media, the judicial system and institutions that protected the voice of people. “In India, that entire framework has been controlled and captured by the Bharatiya Janata Party government; the entire architecture designed for giving voice to the people has been captured.”.

Mr. Gandhi termed the control of institutions by the government a big problem. No other country in the world today was faced with a situation where even the Media did not question the government when its land had been seized by another nation. “Mr. Modi is not interested in India’s people but is only concerned about protecting and promoting his image, which would have got dented had he admitted to China’s incursion. The media, by helping promote his image, is also to blame,” he said.

Also read | Congress will repeal farm laws, promises Rahul Gandhi

When asked about Opposition parties making fun of his protests in Punjab and Haryana, Mr. Gandhi shrugged it off, saying they had done that in February too, when he had first warned about Coronavirus. “But the truth is there for all to see now,” he said. Six months on, everyone would know the truth of what he was saying now on the farm laws too. Taking a dig at Mr. Modi’s statement that India would win the war against COVID-19 in 22 days, he said, “You can see for yourself who talks more sense - Modi or me.” “You [media] can decide who is joking.”

‘Laws will destroy MSP

The farm laws, he asserted, would end up destroying the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the Public Distribution System (PDS). Calling the existing food security system a fortress for the farmers, he said it had needed improvement and reforms. “The new laws will destroy the whole food security system. This will affect the entire chain of the system, rendering lakhs of people employed in the farming sector jobless, and also ending the subsidies for the poor. If Mr. Modi was so confident that these laws were beneficial to farmers, why didn’t he face a debate in Parliament, why did he push the laws during COVID-19 times when farmers cannot come out on the roads. Why did he not hold a press conference or come and meet the farmers in Punjab,” Mr. Gandhi said.

India’s 9,19,023 active cases of COVID-19 constitute “merely” 13.75 % of the total caseload as on date and the country continues to report a steadily declining trend of percentage of active cases, the Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday.

So far 56,62,490 people have recovered from the disease in the country and exceed active cases of coronavirus infection by 47,43,467 as on date, it stated.

“The declining trend of the percentage of active cases is commensurately supported by the rising percentage of recovered cases,” the Ministry underlined.

Higher number of recoveries has aided the national recovery rate to further improve to 84.70 %, the Ministry said.

A total of 75,787 people have recovered from COVID-19 and discharged in a span of 24 hours whereas 61,267 new infections were reported during the same period, according to the data updated at 8 a.m.

The new recoveries have exceeded the new confirmed cases in 25 States and UTs, the Ministry highlighted.

Seventy-four per cent of the new recovered cases are concentrated in 10 states and UTs — Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal, the ministry said.

Maharashtra alone has contributed the maximum with nearly 13,000 single-day recoveries.

The ministry said that 75 % of the 61,267 new confirmed cases recorded in a span of 24 hours are from 10 States and UTs.

Maharashtra continues to be the State reporting a very high number of new cases with more than 10,000 cases followed by Karnataka with more than 7,000 cases.

After a gap of more than six months, cinemas will open their doors on October 15 but it will not be the same again, with the Information and Broadcasting Ministry issuing a set of protocols that include 50% of seating, no food will be delivered inside the halls, only packaged food will be allowed, face masks and thermal screening will be mandatory, show timings will be staggered and your contact number will be taken to facilitate contact tracing later.

Other than the usual physical distancing norms of six feet distance, compulsory face masks, providing hand sanitisers in the common area, as per the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) issued by the Ministry, every alternate seat has to be kept vacant, which means that when you and your loved ones go to watch a movie together, you will have to sit apart, with a minimum gap of one seat between each other.

“Seats that are “Not to be occupied” shall be marked as such during booking [for both online booking and at the box office sale of tickets]. The “Not to be occupied” seats inside cinemas/theatres/multiplexes should either be taped or marked with fluorescent markers to prevent people from occupying these seats so as to ensure adequate physical distancing at all times,” the SOPs state.

The cinema halls will have to ensure that there is no overcrowding in the common areas, lobbies and washrooms during the intermissions. This could even mean no sauntering out of the hall during the interval. “Audiences may be encouraged to avoid movement during the intermission. Longer intermissions may be used to allow the audience seated in different rows of the auditorium to move in a staggered manner,” the SOPs specify.

During the exit too, the halls will have to ensure staggered row-wise manner to avoid crowding.

And unlike the pre-COVID-19 times, when multiplexes would have many movies running in many screens simultaneously, the I&B Ministry has strictly suggested that the show commencement time, intermission period and finish time of a show at any screen shall not overlap with the commencement time, intermission period or finish time of a show at any other screen at a multiplex.

The Ministry has also suggested that for booking tickets, digital and no-contact transactions should be preferred and sufficient numbers of counters at the box office shall be opened with adequate physical distancing, to prevent crowding during booking of tickets.

Former Union Minister Dilip Ray was convicted by a special CBI court in New Delhi in connection with the two-decade-old coal block allocation scam on Tuesday.

Mr. Ray, then Union Minister of State for Coal, along with Pradip Kumar Banerjee, the then Additional Secretary, Ministry of Coal, and Nityanand Gautam, the then adviser (projects) Ministry of Coal, were convicted by the court in the case pertaining to allocation of 105.153 hectares of abandoned coal mining area in Giridih district of Jharkhand. The coal block was allotted to Castron Technologies Limited (CTL) in 1999.

Pronouncing the judgment through video conferencing, Special Judge (CBI), New Delhi, Bharat Parashar held Mr. Ray guilty of offences under Sections 120-B and 120-B/409/420 of IPC and Sections 13 (1) (c) and 13 (1) (d) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The two former Coal Ministry officials were also found guilty under similar sections.

The CTL, its mining arm based in Kolkata and promoter Mahendra Kumar Agarwalla were also convicted.

Initially, the Central Vigilance Commission had examined allegations of wrongdoing and corruption in coal block allocation. The case was subsequently referred to the CBI. The Central agency, upon finding sufficient incriminating material relating to coal block allocation, registered regular cases.

It was submitted that Mr. Ray had himself approved the guidelines of Ministry of Coal stating that no coal block shall be allocated for captive mining to a company engaged in production of iron and steel or sponge iron if the annual production capacity is less than 1 MTPA in opencast mining but, in the case of CTL, he agreed to relax the guidelines so as to extend undue benefits to the private parties involved.

Holding them guilty, Justice Parashar said, “It has been now concluded beyond shadows of all reasonable doubts that all the accused persons had conspired together so as to procure allocation of a captive coal block – Brahmadiha coal block – in favour of CTL.”

The judge said in the order that the criminal conspiracy was undertaken by various acts of cheating by CTL and M. K. Agarwalla and by various acts constituting the offence of criminal misconduct, as defined under P.C. Act, 1988, by Mr. Ray, Mr. Banerjee and Mr. Gautam and also the offence of criminal breach of trust by Mr. Ray as public servant .

Mr. Ray, also a prominent hotelier, is a founding member of the Biju Janata Dal. He was a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government. After he left the regional party in 2002, he had joined the Congress. He remained in the Congress from 2004 to 2008.

In 2002, Mr. Ray was, however, elected to Rajya Sabha as an Independent member with the help of BJP MLAs.

He joined the BJP in 2009 and was elected as an MLA from Rourkela constituency in 2014. After the CBI named him in the charge sheet in 2016, the politician left the BJP in 2018. Political circles were abuzz with speculation that he would return to the BJD ahead of the 2019 election.

Among those named in the FIR are chartered accountant Vinay Jalan, his son Parth and Usha Martin’s authorised signatory Raj Kumar Kapur.

The FIR alleges that Mr. Sinha conspired with the other accused persons to receive bribe in lieu of the favours extended to them in another case registered against Usha Martin and others in 2016, which pertained to an iron ore mining lease.

Mr. Sinha was the supervisory officer of the 2016 case before his retirement on August 31. As alleged, Mr. Jalan had assured the accused persons that, through his contacts in the CBI, he would ensure a favourable outcome.

According to the agency, Mr. Sinha met Mr. Jalan at a Delhi hotel on September 23. During the meeting, the latter asked his son to prepare a reply to the summons issued by the CBI to Usha Martin and also asked him to meet Mr. Sinha on his next visit.

“There was a demand of ₹50 lakh from the accused company through the chartered accountant. The CBI laid a trap. The chartered accountant and the former official were arrested on October 3.

Attacking the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the alleged gang-rape of a 19-year-old girl in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar said on Monday that the Sangh and its political arm saw women only as “commodities.”

Mr. Ambedkar, grandson of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his “conspicuous silence.”

“The heinous Hathras incident has been protested at all levels of society… The younger generation is now looking at the oppression of women from a different perspective. In this changing scenario, it is worth noting that the mentality of the RSS-BJP throughout has been to propagate this notion of women as objects of consumption,” the VBA leader said after a protest in Pune.

He said it was heartening to see youth coming out in large numbers to protest crimes against women.

A noted lawyer himself, the VBA chief said that the U.P. police and the Special Investigation Team (SIT) had no right to ‘threaten’ the kin of the victim.

“Who is giving the officials these instructions to intimidate the victim’s family? It can only be the political leadership of Uttar Pradesh. That is why the victim’s family has demanded that the supreme court appoint a judge to inquire into the matter, and monitor the probe.

Alleging that Channa Swamy was misbehaving with his wife, the accused Venkanna had an altercation with Channa Swamy a few days ago. When the latter did not mend his ways, Venkanna and Nagamani allegedly hatched a plan to eliminate him, the SP said.

Accordingly, he families of Venkanna and Channa Swamy consumed arrack in a mango orchard on Sunday night. After having the drink, Venkanna allegedly attacked the victim with an iron rod. When Titupatamma screamed for help, the couple also hit her with the rod killing her on the spot.

When their daughter tried to escape from the scene, the couple caught and allegedly strangled her to death. Later, they brought the bodies near the NSP canal in an auto and tried to throw them to the in water.

However, they left the bodies on the road and strewn the plastic material on the road to pass it off as road accident, said Mr. Ravindranath Babu.

71,2020/10/06,Once brimming irrigation tank turns bone dry,"Borewells sunk become defunct despite district receiving 100% excess rainfall in September

More than 100 borewells dug in the past one year, a majority of them during the pandemic, have gone dry, and Pathacheruvu, a village in Kalyandurg mandal of Anantapur district, today resembles a ‘graveyard of borewells’ (a rough estimate puts their number at 1,000), where hardly a couple of them yield one-inch of water from 500 feet below the surface.

Interestingly, residents had to abandon the village in 2002 because of abundance of water in the irrigation tank by the same name — Pathacheruvu or Peddacheruvu.

The village, situated about a couple of km from the Anantapur - Kalyandurg State Highway, used to get cut off from the remaining areas due to the overflowing irrigation tank.

With much persuasion, the TDP government had given small bits of land to the villagers close to the State Highway. The new habitation got the same name (Pathacheruvu) in the revenue records.

Today, there is an eerie silence in the old habitation as it has been abandoned. Only the superstructures of houses remain. The doors and windows of these houses have been removed and a few walls have partially fallen.

Despite the district recording 100% excess rainfall in September, and more than the annual rainfall in the first four months, there is not a drop of water in the Peddacheruvu. As a result, farmers such as Shyamanthi Eswaramma struggle to irrigate the tomato crop.

Plight of farmers

With the inflows into the irrigation tank dwindling over the last 18 years, the villagers started sinking tens of borewells every year, and Eswaramma’s husband had sunk 15 boreswells.

Burdened with debts and apprehending pressure from the money-lenders, he had deserted his wife and three children and left for Bengaluru.

But Eswaramma stayed put, purchased a bullock and began farming with the help of her children. Besides farming, she had taken up rearing of country hens to make both ends meet.

In the last one year, she sunk three borewells, and only one of them yields one-inch of water for an hour enough for a small piece of land adjacent to the old habitation, where she grows tomatoes.

Though she has three acres of land in three different locations in the village, there is no water for irrigation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/32rplz/article32786232.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJPG4-FARMER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/once-brimming-irrigation-tank-turns-bone-dry/article32786233.ece
72,2020/10/06,Chain-snatching gangs on the prowl in Chittoor-T.N. border areas,"Youth skirt CCTV surveillance to target lonely women in rural areas

The Chittoor police on Tuesday alerted people in the eastern mandals bordering with Tamil Nadu to be alert about strangers moving on sports bikes on rural roads, and immediately inform the area police if they found any suspicious movements.

A chain-snatching incident on the Srikalahasti-Pichatur road under the KVB Puram police station on Monday, in which an elderly woman suffered minor injuries, created a flutter. Two youth on a high-end motorcycle without a registration plate were seen moving on the isolated road, away from the Puttur-Chennai NH. The duo, suspected to be from Tami Nadu, allegedly attacked an elderly woman while she was going to her village, and decamped with a gold chain weighing 16 gm in a flash.

Immediately after the attack, the residents informed the area police, who scrutinised the CCTV footage at vital junctions. “Except for one side angle at one junction, the duo’s movement was not recorded anywhere in other junctions. This shows that they made themselves thorough with the digital surveillance network and are targeting rural areas without CC cameras,” sub-inspector of KVB Puram police station D. Gopi said.

It is suspected that some motorcycle-borne youth from Tamil Nadu had allegedly formed into groups to indulge in chain-snatchings. Their modus operandi is to not only target lonely women pedestrians, but also women pillion riders. The mandals of Puttur, Nagari, Nindra, Nagalapuram, Pitchatur, Varadaiahpalem and Satyavedu in the Chittoor police division, which border with Tamil Nadu are targeted by the gangs, as afaer committing a crime they can cross into Tamil Nadu within 15 minutes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/chain-snatching-gangs-on-the-prowl-in-chittoor-tn-border-areas/article32786127.ece

According to the Bangarupalem police, the families of Govindaiah and Varadaiah of CJFC Colony, a forested hamlet of Veluthuru Chenu panchayat, were allegedly involved in rivalry since a decade.

On Sunday night, a dispute reportedly broke out between the two families over a petty issue. Govindaiah, who was reportedly in an inebriated condition, picked up a country rifle and allegedly fired at Varadaiah and two of his family members, including a woman, critically injuring all the three.

Neighbours rushed the three to the Government Area Hospital at Bangarupalem in the early hours of Monday. Some elders of the hamlet reportedly tried to hush-up the dispute fearing police intervention, but the news somehow reached the Bangarupalem police.

Sub-Inspector V. Ramakrishna formed a special party and conducted an inquiry at the hamlet on Tuesday.

The Centre has decided to go ahead with notifying the jurisdiction of both Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Godavari River Management Board (GRMB) as per the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, Union Minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekawat said at the second Apex Council meeting held with Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and K. Chandrasekhara Rao respectively.

The jurisdiction of both KRMB and GRMB have not been decided even after six years of bifurcation of the State. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy took part in the virtual meet at New Delhi.

It was learnt that though the Chief Minister Telangana dissented, the Centre struck to its stand saying that no consensus was needed and soon the jurisdiction of both KRMB and GRMB would be notified.

The Chief Ministers of both States agreed to submit the Detailed Project Reports (DPRs) of all the projects taken up by the two Telugu States and the technical appraisal of the DPRs would be completed as soon as possible.

Major decisions

Among the other major decisions taken with regard to contentious issue of sharing of river waters between the two States included decision to withdraw cases filed in the Supreme Court by the Telangana government to enable Centre to move forward on referring the water sharing issues to the tribunal under Section-3 of Inter States River Water Disputes Act of 1956, after taking legal opinion.

The Centre also asked both States to send their requests with regard to sharing of river waters of the Godavari to enable the Centre to refer to the tribunal under ISWRD Act-1956. The Chief Minister of Telangana agreed to this proposal. It was also agreed to shift the KRMB headquarters to Andhra Pradesh.

Limited role

Stating that the States have a limited role in allocation of river waters as the water allocations are done by the tribunals, the Minister said that in case of the Krishna waters, the allocations done by KWDT-I are being heard by KWDT-II and the award would be published soon.

In case of the Godavari waters, the GWDT had not given any en-bloc allocations of the Godavari water to the two States and the Minister said that the en-bloc and project allocations was needed for appraisal of DPRs of projects in the basin.

Further, the Minister also said that a mechanism for sharing of river waters in the Godavari basin between the two States was necessary either by mutual agreement or through a new tribunal. It was also decided that a mechanism should be worked out for sharing of 45 tmcft of the Godavari waters diverted from Polavaram to Prakasam Barrage.

The Congress called for a nationwide satyagraha seeking justice to the Dalit girl on Monday. Congress activists led by Mr. Sailajanath took part in the satyagraha in-front of the Prakasam Bhavan here.

“It is time the Yogi Adityanath government took stern action against the perpetrators based on the statements made by the victim before her death. The Congress will spearhead a protracted struggle till the victim gets justice and her family members get compensation,” said Mr. Sailajanath asserted.

Taking exception to the way the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh treated Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi when they proceeded to meet the family members of the victim.

Taking a dig at the YSRCP government in the State, the APCC chief said, “It is unfortunate that the YSRCP government supports the NDA government at the Centre on each and every issue at the drop of a hat.”

Referring to the three farm laws, he said the YSRCP backed the NDA when the Bills were passed in Parliament. “The farm laws are pro-corporate and anti-farmer. With the laws, the market intervention system which protected farmers will come undone, reducing the small and marginal farmers to mere labourers,” he said.

Adviser (Public Affairs) to the State government Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy has alleged that TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu is writing letters to Director General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang with a mala fide intention of painting a false picture about the law and order in the State.

“Mr. Naidu has failed as the Leader of Opposition as he never raised issues of public interest. Instead, he has been writing letters to the DGP knowing well that the latter has his own limitations,” he told the media here on Monday.

Cases against police

Brushing aside the allegations levelled by Mr. Naidu that more than 1,600 cases were registered against police personnel in the State last year, quoting the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said that the TDP president had been writing letters, without knowing the facts.

Mr. Naidu is trying to feed the same untruths to the people, despite a small number of cases were registered against the police personnel, he said.

“Mr. Naidu has exaggerated the figures in his letter to the DGP. In Chittoor, it was erroneously mentioned that 400 such cases were registered while the actual figure is just four. The correct data has been sent to teh NCRB for corrections,” said Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has already made it clear that serious action will be taken against the officials involved in any crime or corruption, said Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy

“The Opposition has failed miserably in the State as the party leaders don’t know how to act responsibly. Mr. Naidu is only concerned about playing politics for political mileage.

The State government on Monday issued orders for the purchase of sweet lime at ₹10,000 per metric tonne directly from the farmers to help them tide over the crisis induced by the pandemic.

Special Commissioner and Director of Agricultural Marketing P.S. Pradyumna said that the decision was taken to support the farmers who were not getting the Minimum Support Price(MSP) as the sales were affected.

In the discussion of the Group of Ministers, it was felt that since sweet lime is rich in vitamin-C and aids in disease resistance, it should be made available to people in rural areas too, at subsidised prices.

The procurement of sweet lime shall be made from farmers only through NeML Software by the supplying Agriculture Market Committee, the maximum quantum of procurement would be 10,000 tonnes at ₹10,000 per MT. The procured product shall be supplied to Rythu Bazars through . The procurement limit has been set at 20 MT (200 quintals) per acre for a maximum of 5 acres - 100 MT (or 1000 quintals) per farmer.

In the beginning days of the pandemic in Anantapur district, where the crop is grown in 1,40,000 acres, there was no such support for the farmers, whose problems had compounded when the lockdown was announced, as sending the produce outside the State had turned a herculean task.

‘Price very low’

The Rythu Sangham leaders told The Hindu on Monday that the price then was ₹6,000 a tonne in the open market which led to thousands of acres of sweet lime farms remaining unattended, and fruits were not plucked as it was not economically viable. “Currently, the fruit is being sold between ₹20,000 and ₹30,000 a tonne in the open market depending on its grade and if the government gives only ₹10,000 a tonne, the price in the open market will also drastically fall,” they opined.

Unless the sweet lime is sold at ₹30,000 a tonne, it was economically not viable, they said. In the summer of 2019, the fruit was sold at ₹60,000 a tonne in the open market.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ap-govt-to-buy-sweet-lime-at-10000-per-tonne/article32777327.ece

89,2020/10/06,Water bodies choking on plastic wastes: NGO,"‘They are also causing death of fish’

The haphazard dumping of plastic wastes is polluting water bodies and causing the death of fish. One in every three plastic wastes is reaching the drains and from there into the rivers and ultimately into the ocean, Vinod Bodhankar, co-founder of Sagarmitra, has said.

At a webinar on ‘Mana Nudi, Mana Nadi’ on the theme of ‘Plastic waste management through people’s participation’, Mr. Vinod said that the ultraviolet rays of the sun was breaking plastic wastes into small pieces. The fish and birds were mistaking them for food and eating them, resulting in their death. He explained that the Krishna river carries plastic wastes from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and dumps it into the Bay of Bengal. The same was the case with plastic wastes getting dumped into oceans across the world.

Sagarmitra, in association with Jalbiradari, has been creating awareness among schoolchildren against the hazards of dumping of plastic wastes. The participating children were asked to collect the plastic wastes, generated at their homes, like bottles and empty toothpaste containers every month and bring the collection to the school. Sagarmitra tied up with a plastic manufacturer and the latter would pick up the wastes for recycling. The manufacturer would pay the school management for the collection. The money collected would be utilised by the school managements, in consultation with the students, for providing gifts to children of martyrs, development of school infrastructure or giving donations to poor students and staff.

The movement, which began with 150 members in 2013, has now three lakh students as members in three nations – India (Maharashtra), America and Morocco. The objective of Sagarmitra was to get the concept included in the curriculum of schools across the world, with the approval of the United Nations Organisation (UNO), he said.

Social activist Bolisetty Satyanarayana, programme coordinator, said that a similar programme would soon be taken up for the purification of rivers in Rayalaseema, on the suggestion of Waterman of India Rajendra Singh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/water-bodies-choking-on-plastic-wastes-ngo/article32776978.ece
90,2020/10/06,COVID-19 | Vaccine trial begins at KGH,"Two volunteers administered the vaccine on the first day in Visakhapatnam

King George Hospital (KGH), has embarked on a historic journey on Monday with the beginning of the trial for coronavirus vaccine.

The vaccine Covishield, which was developed by the Oxford University, with Serum India Limited and the IndianCouncil of Medical research (ICMR) as partners, was administered to the first volunteer by KGH Superintendent and principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar.

The vaccine was administered under strict guidelines issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and as per the protocols laid down by the Oxford University, Serum India Limited and the ICMR, Dr. Sudhakar told The Hindu .

The KGH and the AMC intend to select around 100 volunteers for conducting various tests prior to the vaccine trial and 20 volunteers have already registered as of now.

About 10 volunteers were called on the first day on Monday and eight qualified the norms. Of the eight, two were administered the vaccine on Monday. Prior to administering the vaccine, the volunteers discussed their medical history with a team of 10 doctors and underwent various tests, including RT-PCR for the coronavirus, said Mr. Sudhakar.

The two volunteers who were administered the vaccine were put under observation for a few hours before they were allowed to go home. They will be tested again for development of antibodies 57 days later. Such tests will be conducted periodically for six months, said Dr. Sudhakar.

Strict protocol

The vaccine is not only administered under strict protocol, but even storing it also is defined in the protocol. It has been stored in temperature varying from 2° to 8° Celsius and the storing process has to be logged and sent to the ICMR.

“For this reason, we have purchased a logger for ₹70,000 and the report will be sent to the ICMR,” he said. It is a learning experience for the team of doctors, as international-standard protocols are being followed.

According to Dr. Sudhakar, volunteers are free to approach the Department of Plastic Surgery in the KGH and register. A team of doctors will examine the volunteers and if satisfied tests will be conducted. People with co-morbidities and those who have tested positive for COVID, are not eligible.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/9xvp23/article32776927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06ONG4VACCINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/covid-vaccine-trial-begins-at-kgh/article32776928.ece

A large number of farmers and their representatives are expected to participate in the convention, said KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar. The All-India Congress Committee has directed the State Congress to organise the convention, he said. The Congress has been opposing the three new farm laws formulated by the Narendra Modi-led government.

A signature campaign of two crore people who had suffered during the COVID-19 lockdown will be collected and handed over to the Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi, the KPCC chief said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kpcc-to-organise-farmers-meeting-on-october-10/article32786474.ece
92,2020/10/06,"After CBI raids, Vokkaliga seers visit D.K. Shivakumar","In a show of solidarity, Vokkaliga seers and other leaders from the community visited Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar’s residence on Tuesday, a day after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) conducted raids against him.

Nirmalanandanatha Swami of Adichunchanagiri Mutt, which enjoys the largest following in the community, visited him in the evening. Earlier in the day, Nanjavadhoota Swami paid a visit to Mr. Shivakumar’s residence. Both seers met him to give him “moral support through tough times”, sources close to the leader said. Karnataka Rakshana Vedike leader Narayana Gowda also visited him and expressed his support.

This attains significance in the run-up to the November 3 byelections in R.R. Nagar and Sira, both of which have a sizeable Vokkaliga voter base. The CBI action could acquire a caste colour in the run-up to the polls, sources said.

When Mr. Shivakumar was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in 2019, Nirmalanandanatha Swami had visited his residence and was vocal in his support.

93,2020/10/06,"With CBI raids on Shivakumar, BJP gearing up for counter-campaign","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raids on Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar appear to have set the tempo for the ensuing bypolls to two Assembly seats, with the ruling BJP getting ready to launch a counter-attack if the Congress puts the raids on its bypoll agenda.

“If the Congress tries to project the raids as a poll issue, then we will launch an aggressive counter-campaign,” a source in the party said. “We will wait and see the Congress’ campaign style. If they try to use the raids as a political agenda, then we will have to raise questions like from where Mr. Shivakumar got the ₹56 lakh that was recovered during the raids and about the sharp increase in his assets.”

BJP sources said the party would also delve into “history of raids” conducted by the CBI against politicians from the Opposition parties during the Congress regime.

BJP State spokesperson Capt. Ganesh Karnik argued that it was not proper to give a political colour to the CBI raids. Maintaining that the probe agency had autonomy to decide on raids, he claimed that the State and the Centre had nothing to do with the raids. He added that the raids were part of an investigation taken up in 2017 and it was “foolish” to add a political motive to it.

Accusing the Congress of misusing Central agencies such as the CBI when it was in power at the Centre, he said the party was looking at the raids with suspicion because of its own past. He also remarked that the people of the State, including the voters of the two constituencies set to see byelections, would “see through” the Congress’ allegations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/with-cbi-raids-on-shivakumar-bjp-gearing-up-for-counter-campaign/article32786442.ece
94,2020/10/06,Legislative Council election candidate booked for forging signatures,"A day after Ravi Padasalagi filed his nomination papers as an Independent candidate for the election to Karnataka West Graduates constituency of the Legislative Council, the authorities found that the signatures of the proposers were fake. A case of fraud has been booked against him.

The Savanur police in Haveri district have booked a case against Mr. Ravi for forging signatures of his proposers in his nomination papers under Sections of 420, 465, 468, 471 of the IPC and under 125(A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, based on a complaint filed by the Assistant Commissioner of Savanur Annapurna Mudakammanavar.

Mr. Padasalagi, a resident of Bengaluru, had filed his first nomination papers for the election in Dharwad on Monday. At the time of acceptance of the papers, a casual perusal of the application had revealed disparities in the signatures of the proposers when checked with official data.

Subsequently, the Assistant Returning Officer and Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil wrote to the Deputy Commissioner of Haveri to look into the issue as the proposers were from Haveri district.

Additional Deputy Commissioner of Haveri S. Yogeshwar told The Hindu that both he and the Assistant Commissioner of Savanur perused the documents and called the proposers for confirmation of their signatures.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/legislative-council-election-candidate-booked-for-forging-signatures/article32786399.ece
95,2020/10/06,How prominently will CBI raids figure in Congress bypoll campaign?,"Though the Congress has questioned the timing of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raids on 14 premises linked to Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar and his brother and MP D.K. Suresh, whether the party will foreground it prominently as a poll issue in the forthcoming byelections to Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituencies remains a question.

T.B. Jayachandra, former Minister and Congress candidate from Sira, did not call it a “poll issue” but said the people would teach the ruling BJP a “fitting lesson” for constantly targeting party leaders through the Income Tax Department, Enforcement Directorate, and the CBI during elections.

Sources in the party said Mr. Shivakumar would talk about being “targeted” as he campaigns in both the constituencies. However, a party insider pointed out that the raids by Central agencies had become “almost a routine affair” in the past few years and might not transform into a “sympathy factor” in the bypolls.

A few Congress leaders said that loyalties of caste, religion, and local issues were expected to play a major role in both constituencies.

In Sira, all three political parties are expected to field candidates belonging to the Vokkaliga community. There are an estimated 49,000 Kunchitiga Vokkaliga voters and about 8,000 Hallikar Vokkaliga voters in Sira. There are about 80,000 voters belonging to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities in the constituency and their votes are expected to play a decisive role.

The BJP may field Rajesh Gowda, son of former MP C.P. Mudalagiriyappa, while the JD(S) may field Ammajamma, wife of the late B. Satyanarayana, whose death necessitated the byelection.

The Congress has decided to field Kusuma H., wife of the late IAS officer D.K. Ravi, in R.R. Nagar constituency in the city. Though the Vokkaliga community has a sizeable chunk of votes in the constituency, the BJP improved its base in the 2019 parliamentary elections. The JD(S) and BJP have not announced their candidates here.

Won’t impact goernment

The results of these byelections will have no impact on the stability of the State government. But if the Congress wins both seats, then it could claim that the results reflected the failures of the government. The Congress is expected to focus largely on the development works undertaken by the former Siddaramaiah government, the “anti-farmer” policies of the current State and Union governments, and the failures of the B.S. Yediyurappa government to handle the COVID-19 crisis.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/how-prominently-will-cbi-raids-figure-in-congress-bypoll-campaign/article32786381.ece
96,2020/10/06,Solar projects may come under lens,"On October 5, the CBI raided 14 premises linked to Mr. Shivakumar and his brother and MP D.K. Suresh.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is not only probing the disproportionate assets allegedly amassed by Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar, but is also digging into “certain specific decisions by him” when he was Energy Minister of the State, to see whether there was any quid pro quo involved, CBI sources said.

On Monday, the CBI raided 14 premises linked to Mr. Shivakumar and his brother and MP D.K Suresh.

Most of these instances are reportedly related to the solar power sector, which received a big boost in the State during Mr. Shivakumar’s tenure but was also dogged by controversies.

The CBI has taken the check period for the disproportionate assets investigation to be from April 1, 2013, to April 30, 2018 — the financial years during which he was Energy Minister in Karnataka. “Proving that he amassed disproportionate assets while holding public office is itself proof of corruption. But the case will only be strengthened if the prosecuting agency finds specific instances of quid pro quo and a money trail to establish corruption. The CBI probe will focus on this aspect as well,” a source in the agency said.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which has probed the complex web of financial transactions of the former Minister and his associates, not only booked him for money laundering, but also recommended a CBI probe under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The ED has reportedly shared leads on instances where illegal gratification is suspected. Most of these relate to solar power projects and the alleged interests his associates acquired in the sector when he was Minister, sources said.

Questioned earlier

The ED had earlier questioned MLA for Belagavi Rural Lakshmi Hebbalkar, a close associate of Mr. Shivakumar, and the KPCC chief’s daughter Aishwarya Shivakumar over their alleged interests in solar power plants, acquired when he was Minister.

The ED had also probed six solar power plants at Hagaribommanahalli, Ballari district, on the suspicion that they were benami properties of Mr. Shivakumar. The rooftop solar power generation scheme of 2016, which was also dogged by allegations of corruption, is also being looked into. Not just that, other power purchase agreements inked during his tenure are under the scanner, sources in the CBI said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1yduke/article32786095.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06KRADKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/solar-projects-may-come-under-lens/article32786096.ece

Arsikere taluk stands second in the number of COVID-19 cases in the district, after Hassan taluk.

He also suggested that the officers follow-up people home quarantined and ensure they did not come out of their houses. The taluk panchayat executive officers and tahsildars should take care of those home quarantined, he said.

It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that charge sheet filed against him has no ingredient to attract Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code as his statement has no reference to another religion or any allegation against another religion.

However, the court said that, “on close reading of the contents of the speech in the complaint, there are two religions. One is the Muslim community and another one has been indirectly in the form of innuendo, and it has been stated with reference to the other religions.”

The appellant Sudhanva Bhandolkar had approached the KIC after being denied the answer scripts by the commission. The order signed by State Information Commissioner K.P. Manjunatha on September 29 said that PIO and Section Officer Shashikala had not provided the information despite the KIC order. The KIC has also slapped a fine of ₹25,000 on the officer.

Showcause notices had been issued as to why ₹25,000 penalty should not be imposed for not providing the information, and also as to why compensation of ₹1 lakh should not be awarded for loss or other detriments suffered by the appellant. “Ms. Shashikala has not appeared before the KIC and also chose to ignore the directions, to submit her explanation for the showcause notices,” the order noted.

The KIC has directed the KPSC to deduct ₹25,000 from the salary payable to her in 5 equal instalments starting from the month of October, 2020 and report compliance.

102,2020/10/06,"Schools, PU colleges in State to remain closed this month","Schools and pre-university colleges will not reopen in Karnataka this month despite the Centre allowing States to resume classes from October 15 in a phased manner under Unlock 5. However, with the number of COVID-19 cases showing no signs of dropping, the State government is reluctant to reopen schools.

A meeting was convened on Tuesday by B. Sriramalu, Health and Family Welfare Minister, with officials from the Department of Primary and Secondary Education and the chairman of the COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Sriramalu said the Health Department will submit a report with a list of its recommendations.

A source in the Department of Primary and Secondary Education said they had asked the Health Department when it was feasible for schools and PU colleges to reopen. “We have also sought advice on which classes can be started first and what kind of cooperation can be expected from community representatives,” said the source.

According to a senior official in the Department of Primary and Secondary Education, more precautions need to be put in place to ensure the safety of students and staff. “We have not made any preparations for reopening schools. We have issued an SOP but that is not enough. Our schools need to adopt several precautionary measures, and it will not be feasible to do all of that in a week.” He added that parents, the department had consulted with, did not want schools to reopen so quickly.

The Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka (KAMS) opined that the government should allow students from grades nine to 12 to return to the classroom after all safety measures have been put in place.

KAMS in a letter to the department also said that only three hours of classes should be allowed in the first month, and recommended a ban on gatherings or lunch breaks. They also said they would prefer to conduct classes on alternate days rather than adopt a shift system.

Schools have urged the department to ensure that COVID-19 tests are conducted on the school premises for staff, and to subsidise the cost of sanitisers and thermal scanners.

Incidentally, the Centre on Monday issued SOPs and guidelines for health and safety protocols for reopening of schools and learning with physical/social distancing.

Mahesh, however, came face to face with Maruti Jadhav and his wife Sharda Bai as he entered the house. “The couple tried to raise an alarm, and I stabbed them to death,” Mahesh is said to have told the police during interrogation.

According to the police, Mahesh was in love with Maruti Jadhav’s daughter, but Maruti Jadhav refused to accept the relationship and told his daughter to cut off her ties with Mahesh.

Maruti Jadhav had also filed a complaint against Mahesh under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (PoCSO) Act a few months ago.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/police-solve-double-murder-within-48-hours-arrest-five/article32784967.ece

“With the number COVID-19 cases slightly coming down in the district, we have sufficient number of beds and ventilators available for patients. As on today, only 12 of the 93 ventilators are being used for COVID-19 patients and the remaining are ready to be used as and when the need arises. Similarly, 20 % of the beds meant for COVID-19 patients are vacant. These resources are ready to be used if there is a surge in cases,” she said.

She was addressing a media conference at her office here on Tuesday.

Asked about the RT-PCR laboratory that was supposed to be set up at the Central University of Karnataka, Ms. Jyothsna said that the project got delayed as the cost was revised with a hike of ₹ 10 lakh.

“We will take steps to make it functional in a week. As many as eight COVID-19 Care Centres are functioning at present.

105,2020/10/06,"Now, choultry owners cry foul over high property tax","They want ‘super commercial’ category scrapped

The COVID-19 pandemic-induced blow to the economy has brought an alleged anomaly in the levy of property tax for certain commercial establishments in Mysuru into sharp focus. Marriage choultry owners have now joined hotel owners and film exhibitors in calling for scrapping of the “super commercial” category in property tax structure.

After hotel owners and film exhibitors in Mysuru expressed their ire over the exorbitant amount of property tax they have to cough up, it was the turn of a delegation from Mysuru Kalyana Mantapa Owners Association to submit a memorandum to Mayor Tasneem, requesting the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) to pass a resolution to scrap the “super commercial” category.

Association president K.R. Sathyaranarayan told The Hindu marriage choultry owners are reeling under an unprecedented economic crunch due to the restrictions on gatherings for marriages and other events. The marriage choultry owners had suffered huge losses due to cancellation of the marriages booked after March 2020.

Also, the future looks gloomy with marriages of large gatherings unlikely to return at least till March 2021 as the authorities have placed a ceiling of on the number of attendees at such events.

Hence, he said the Association had urged the MCC authorities to waive the property tax applicable on marriage choultries for the year, besides scrapping “super commercial” category that had caused a financial burden on the owners, who already have to bear GST, electricity bill, water bill, and trade licence fee, besides the salaries of the personnel and security.

Mysuru Hotel Owners Association President Narayana Gowda said the MCC created the “super commercial” category for property tax payment about 12 years ago.

While the domestic or residential category of property owners pay about 0.9 per cent of the guidance value of property as property tax, commercial category of property owners pay about 1.5 per cent of its guidance value, Mr. Gowda said adding that the “super commercial” category of properties such as marriage choultries, malls, hotels and lodges, besides movie theatres, pay 2.28 per cent.

Mr. Sathyanarayana contended that the choultry owners will be able to save about 25 to 30 per cent of the tax if they are brought under the commercial category.

Mr. Sathyanarayana and Mr. Narayana Gowda said the “super commercial” category of property tax payment is not in vogue in any other part of the State including Bengaluru. “It is a huge burden on the businesses in Mysuru”, said Mr. Gowda, calling for its immediate scrapping.

While the Mayor assured the delegation of marriage choultry owners that the matter will be taken up in the MCC council meeting, sources in the MCC said any change in the tax structure needs to be brought before the council and an approval needs to be secured to bring about any change in the by-laws.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/now-choultry-owners-cry-foul-over-high-property-tax/article32784297.ece
106,2020/10/06,MCC meeting: Councillors express ire over lack of beds in private hospitals,"Differences with Commissioner come to the fore

Councillors of the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) have expressed their ire over lack of beds for COVID-19 patients in private hospitals in the city.

The meeting convened on Tuesday saw many members airing their concern over the increase in the mortality rate and the rise in COVID-19 cases in Mysuru and the failure of the government to ensure that all hospitals reserve 50 per cent of the beds to treat the patients.

Former Mayor Arif Hussain said though there is a government notification to that effect and was being complied with in Bengaluru, the private hospitals in Mysuru were denying beds to COVID-19 patients.

He was supported by other members who said that the private hospitals were charging heavily to treat the COVID-19 patients and the poor were the worst affected.

The undercurrent of rift and differences between Mayor Tasneem and MCC Commissioner Gurudutt Hegde also came to the fore during the council meeting.

Ms. Tasneem alleged that the position of the Mayor had been reduced to being symbolic, shorn of any significance, and that the Commissioner had not taken her into confidence on the allotment of ₹50 lakh grant for each ward. She said though she placed the demand before the Commissioner many times, it had been ignored and she as a Mayor felt slighted.

She expressed indignation that as a result, her promises and assurances to the councillors were devoid of any substance.

It may be recalled that the district in-charge Minister S.T. Somashekar had held a meeting to resolve the perceived differences between the Mayor and the Commissioner in May. The differences emerged over the alleged failure of the officials to take the councillors into confidence on the steps being taken to handle the pandemic in the city. Mr. Somashekar had stated that there was a communication gap which had led to the differences and claimed that he had resolved it. But Tuesday’s council meeting indicates that the differences persist.

There were acrimonious scenes in the council over the alleged rape and murder of a Dalit woman in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh as the Congress and the JD(S) members raised slogans against the BJP. This led to a war of words with the BJP councillors objecting to raising the issue in the council and argued that the members should discuss issues and challenges pertaining to the city.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mcc-meeting-councillors-express-ire-over-lack-of-beds-in-private-hospitals/article32784242.ece

In a bid to implement the mask rule strictly, the Dharwad district administration launched a special drive to penalise those not wearing masks in public places on Tuesday.

Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil, accompanied by Zilla Panchayat CEO B.C. Sateesh, Assistant Commissioner Gopalkrishna B., municipal commissioner Suresh Itnal and District Health and Family Welfare Officer Yashwanth Madeenkar and others, led the special drive in Dharwad on Tuesday.

Led by him, the officials intercepted pedestrians, commuters, motorists and tried to convince them of the need for wearing face masks.

Speaking to presspersons after launching the drive, Mr. Patil said that the imposition of fine was being done mainly to warn people in view of COVID-19 spread and to control it. He said that so far penalty of over ₹ 35 lakh had been collected from people not wearing masks. He said that fine was being imposed on 500-600 persons daily.

110,2020/10/06,Drug probe: CCB raids house of former underworld don Muthappa Rai’s son,"Police say that Ricky Rai was in touch with Aditya Alva and other accused who are on the run

The Central Crime Branch (CCB) police, which is probing the drug racket allegedly linked to the Kannada film industry, detained Ricky Rai, son of the former underworld don-turned-social activist late Muthappa Rai, for questioning on Tuesday. A team also searched his house in Sadashivanagar.

CCB officials suspect he has information on the whereabouts of Aditya Alva, son of the late Minister Jeevaraj Alva and the brother-in-law of Bollywood star Vivek Oberoi, who has been absconding ever since he was named one of the key accused in the case. “During the course of our investigation, we came across information that Aditya and the other accused who are on the run, are in touch with Ricky,” said a CCB official.

Search operations in Bidadi house

Based on this information, a CCB police team questioned Ricky before searching the premises. Officials later went to Muthappa Rai’s house near Bidadi, questioned staff employed there, and searched the premises. “Ricky was not just in touch with the accused but also attended the parties they hosted. We have also checked his mobile phone,” said the official.

Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), confirmed the developments. “Warrants were obtained and a search conducted in Ricky’s house based on information that he is supporting a few of the absconding accused,” he said.

111,2020/10/06,Fine for not wearing masks opposed,"The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has opposed the move to impose heavy fine on people not wearing face masks and urged the government to immediately withdraw it.

In a press release, Dharwad district CPI(M) secretary Mahesh Pattar has said that instead of properly sensitising people and convincing them of the need to wear masks, the BJP-led government has resorted to looting them by imposing fine of ₹ 1,000 in urban areas and ₹ 500 in rural areas for not wearing masks.

He said that the government had failed to address the problems being faced by the people because of the ill-planned lockdown and instead of helping them out, it had resorted to fleecing them on the pretext of imposing a rule to contain COVID-19. This move would amount to putting further burden on commoners who were already under financial duress, he added.

Mr. Pattar said that the BJP government in the State was involved in corruption in the procurement of healthcare equipment and setting up COVID Care Centres. It had looted the public in the name of providing treatment for COVID-19. “Now, it has resorted to looting the people in the name of penalty for not wearing masks,” he said.

While the CPI(M) would appeal to the people to wear masks for their own safety, it would oppose such a loot by the ruling disposition, he said in the release.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fine-for-not-wearing-masks-opposed/article32783675.ece

“I thank the MLAs and other people’s representatives for understanding the situation and supporting the government in its fight against the pandemic. I know Madikeri Dasara is also very popular and grand. But the situation does not permit us to allow a large gathering. Such a resolve from them can help contain the spread,” he told reporters.

Earlier, Appachhu Ranjan, MLA, urged the government to impose Section 144 during Cauvery Theerthodbhava event and Madikeri Dasara fete for restricting the public gathering.

113,2020/10/06,COVID-19: 16 out of 100 tested in Kodagu are infected,"Fatality rate in the district jumps to 1.6 per cent

For every 100 persons tested for COVID-19 in Kodagu, one of the popular hill stations in South India, as many as 16 are tested positive. Also, the fatality rate is at 1.6 per cent which is equal to the State death rate, and the mortality rate rose to 2.2 per cent since the past five days.

Disclosing this here on Tuesday, Minister for Medical Education K. Sudhakar said he was worried over the spike in cases as tourists may soon arrive in large numbers with the unlocking of many restrictions. There is a need to keep a watch on homestays and resorts which get visitors and the district administration can look at practically implementable solutions for checking the spread. The hospitality industry can insist on COVID-19 negative certificates from the guests if need be, he suggested.

Mr. Sudhakar, who held a meeting to review the COVID-19 situation and management, said he has asked the Deputy Commissioner to work towards restricting gatherings and subjecting traders and street vendors to periodic COVID-19 tests for containing the spread. If necessary, village fairs can be shifted away from the human habitations..

He also told the officials to strictly enforce the penalty on those not wearing the mask since it is the only effective means at this juncture to combat the pandemic until the vaccine was developed. “People cannot be negligent all the time and it’s the responsibility of all to fight the pandemic. We have passed the awareness stage and fines have become inevitable.”

The Minister told the healthcare authorities to track primary and secondary contacts of the infected persons within 48 hours of the infection. If the contacts are not tracked within the time, spreading can happen rapidly.

The elected representatives of Kodagu urged the Minister to ramp up healthcare facilities in Kodagu since the district lacks adequate number of public and private hospitals and nursing homes and the people largely depend on Mysuru and Mangaluru for their healthcare needs.

Mr. Sudhakar said he will speak to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on expanding healthcare infrastructure, including super speciality hospitals, keeping in mind what the MLAs have cited on the district’s position on the health map. “I know many are dependent on the hospital of Kodagu Institute of Medical Sciences which is presently tackling the pandemic,” he replied.

A day after seeking two-weeks’ time for controlling COVID-19 cases in Mysuru, Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri on Tuesday had a meeting with the officials from the Department of Medical Education and senior healthcare professionals from the Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) on the urgency for ramping up facilities for successfully tackling the pandemic.

The cases have spiked since past few days with 700-1,000 new infections being reported almost every day besides surging fatality rate.

Ms. Sindhuri had told the COVID-19 review meeting chaired by Minister for Medical Education K. Sudhakar here on Monday that all efforts would be made to constrain the infection rate. Accordingly, the DC, who took charge recently, collected details on the availability of specialist healthcare professionals, doctors, nursing staff, PG students at the MMCRI and the availability of beds.

The Minister had told the district administration to take extra precautions and strengthen testing ahead of Dasara festivities.

As the tests are going to be ramped up, Ms. Sindhuri told the healthcare authorities to ensure sufficient numbers of doctors and beds were available for tackling the situation.

The number of beds at the K.R. Hospital where critically-ill COVID-19 patients are treated besides the designated COVID-19 hospital here, has to be doubled with the upsurge in cases. As of now, the hospital has 178 beds for COVID-19 patients and the number should go up by another 200 beds, she directed.

She told the MMCRI doctors to expedite the work of equipping beds with oxygen supply at the trauma care centre on KRS Road. This centre has been lying idle since its inauguration for want of equipment and manpower.

Ms. Sindhuri suggested roping in 154 PG students at the Mysuru Medical College and Research Institute for COVID-19 duties for enhancing manpower availability for combating the pandemic.

She later visited the COVID-19 care ward at the hospital and inspected the facilities such as liquid oxygen tank and ventilators.

The nursing staff of the hospital submitted a memorandum to her for fulfilling their demands.

While the Ministry of Food Processing Industries secured first place with a 4.49 score, the Department of Economic Affairs ranked last with a score of 0.40.

The department under the leadership of Mr. Sadananda Gowda, former Chief Minister of Karnataka, has implemented “an innovative PoS solution enhancing their data preparedness levels”.

“The Department of Fertilizers uses desktop PoS and linkages with soil health cards to promote efficient sale of fertilizers and direct benefit transfer (DBT) of fertilizer subsidy to farmers” the Niti Aayog said.

The department has developed a desktop version of PoS as an alternative approach to support services through the PoS devices. It enables retailers who are having laptops and computers to use high speed broadband service for the sale of fertilizers, the Aayog said.

Noting the impact of PoS, Aayog quoting a case study said that “it has not only facilitated easy handling of fertilizer business at retail points but also reduced dependence on PoS devices, and made use of PoS very simple and easy to operate through the help of bigger screen of desktops”.

The survey was initiated to assess the data preparedness of ministries/departments on a standardised framework to promote competition among them and promote best practices. The aim was was to improve the implementation of government policies, schemes and programmes to achieve the desired goals.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/department-of-fertilizers-headed-by-sadananda-gowda-ranks-third-in-implementing-central-schemes/article32782189.ece

Instead of sitting idle during the lockdown, artist Prashanth Achar, 30, from Kundapur taluk in Udupi district, started building models of Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) buses. First, he built a model of an ‘Airavat’ bus.

Elated by the response from his friends and relatives, he built other models of buses, such as ‘Karnataka Sarige’. His effort has been recognised by the transport corporation.

After meeting him on Monday, KSRTC MD Shivyogi C. Kalsad has placed an order for 10 models of various brands of buses operated by the Corporation.

But that is not all. During his meeting with KSRTC officials, Mr. Achar sought help to improve the infrastructure of the government school in his village Bagwadi.

“There was one more reason for visiting Bengaluru, and that was to seek help to improve the infrastructure of the government school in my village where 85 students are enrolled. I am planning to meet the Transport Minister who is also the Deputy Chief Minister. Improving infrastructure at Bagwadi school will help children from rural areas.”

Mr. Kalsad decided to provide an old bus of the KSRTC that can be converted into a classroom for the benefit of school children.

“I am very happy with the MD’s offer of a bus. He has asked us to come up with innovative ideas to make use of the bus,” Mr. Achar said.

“During the lockdown, I had a lot of free time. I was always fascinated by KSRTC buses. I thought why I should not use the free time to build models of these buses. First, I made a model of an ‘Airavat’ bus and posted photos of the bus on social media. The work received very good response from the general public. Even higher ups in the KSRTC took note and contacted me,” he added.

He uses foam sheets to build the models and takes eight days to build a model.

An official of the KSRTC said, “The models of buses designed by Mr. Achar are really good. They are lightweight and easy to carry. We have placed orders for 10 models. We will display them. We are also planning to present them as gifts to dignitaries visiting our office.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/26z9yd/article32775657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGMINIATURESP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/udupi-artists-kstrc-bus-model-rewarded-with-real-bus-for-village-school/article32775658.ece

120,2020/10/06,‘COVID-19 pandemic can spark suicides outside the sphere of conventional risk factors’,"Shobha (name changed), 38, a housewife from an farming family with two children, did not have ‘risk factors’ that mental health experts conventionally associate with suicides. Yet, the woman from a village on the outskirts of Mysuru recently attempted to end her life.

Residents of her village, gripped by anxiety over the spread of COVID-19, had erected fences with branches of trees that not only restricted entry of outsiders into the village, but also the movement of locals. Almost overnight, the village with 40 houses had been separated by fences arbitrarily put up even on small roads.

Three days before July 10 when she attempted to die by suicide, Ms. Shobha was walking back home from her field and encountered a fence blocking her path. She removed a portion of the fence to reach her house, but her act incensed the villagers, who not only scolded her, but called for a panchayat meet in the village. Her husband was summoned and asked to apologise for her behaviour, which amounted to breaking the rules of the village that had been framed to control COVID-19. Her husband felt humiliated and scolded her. Pained, she retreated to her room, locked herself up and attempted suicide.

This case of attempted suicide figuring in the JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research (JSSAHER)’s Digital Journal of Clinical Medicine seeks to demonstrate how social factors during the pandemic are beyond the conventional risk factors for suicide, said Kishor M., a psychiatrist who was part of the study.

Dr. Kishor said risk assessment in case of suicide or suicide attempts involves looking at past history of such attempts, family history of suicides, current and past history of psychiatry illness, medical co-morbidity (like thyroid disorder, epilepsy, etc.) or other recognised risk factors like grief and hopelessness. “This patient did not have any of the risk factors,” he said.

Diagnosed as ‘Impulsive act of deliberate self-harm’, this case seeks to focus attention on the emerging patterns of suicides that mental health experts are grappling with during the pandemic.

The study states that the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a significant rise in stress at various levels including community, family and individual. “Policy measures have been formulated to address and limit the spread of infection. These measures may have led to heightened vigilance, issue of isolation, limited access to basic necessities and financial stress,” the study said, while Dr. Kishor also referred to the increased risk of suicide owing to financial problems arising out of the pandemic.

Social stigma can occur in disease outbreaks, the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused a lot of fear and panic. “The social distancing that is advocated as a preventative measure to control the spread of infection can be misinterpreted and easily manifest as social discrimination,” the study cautioned.

121,2020/10/06,Bengaluru-based candidates fare well in JEE (Advanced),"Several candidates said that online classes helped them

Many city-based students secured good ranks in the Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced) – the results of which were announced on Monday.

A press release by the organising chairman of the examination said that a total of 1,50,838 candidates appeared for both papers 1 and 2 in JEE (Advanced) 2020 and a total of 43,204 candidates qualified JEE (Advanced) 2020. The test is a gateway to get into 23 Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) across the country.

Many candidates said that the lockdown gave them extra time to prepare for the examination and sharpened their skills.

Pranava Singhal, from National Public School, HSR Layout, secured an All India Rank of 103 and said that it was his childhood dream to get into an IIT. “The unique teaching methodology by my coaching class has helped me with preparations of JEE Advanced. When the exam was nearing, I focussed on self study and solved previous year’s papers,” he said. “The lockdown gave me time for preparation and I was eager to finish the exam quickly,” he said, adding that he aspires to get into IIT Bombay and work in computer science or the electronics sector in the future.

Chathurvedhi Talapaneni of Narayana E-techno School, Vidyaranyapura, bagged the All India rank 149 and aspires to get into IIT Madras. He said that for four years, he ensured that he rigorously concentrated on studies. “For two years in Classes 11 and 12, I studied for 12 hours each day,” he said. He said the pandemic helped him stay at home and study in a peaceful environment. He added that he tried to solve as many papers as possible and made short notes for Chemistry that helped him during revision.

Shubhan R. of Sri Chaitanya e-techno School, Bengaluru, who got the 175th rank, said that he managed to get a few extra months to prepare for the examination due to the pandemic. “I found it relaxing to study during the lockdown. I made extensive notes that helped me immensely,” he said. Shubhan, who also secured the second rank in the Common Entrance Test 2020, aspires for a seat in IIT Bombay or IIT Madras. He wants to work in the field of artificial intelligence.

Visually impaired student does well

While several candidates said that online classes helped them, Kummitha Jhanavi of Sri Sri Chaitanya PU College, Vidyaranyapura, who is visually impaired, struggled to sit for long hours in front of the screen during the pandemic.

Yet she managed to get a rank of 162 under the persons with disability category in the Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced). She said that unlike her peers, she could not study continuously and had to take breaks as her eyes would start burning. She said that making extensive notes and hard work was her secret to success.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qnpc73/article32777497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGJEE2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bengaluru-based-candidates-fare-well-in-jee-advanced/article32777499.ece
122,2020/10/06,CBI raids a strategy to divert attention: Khader,"Former Minister U.T. Khader, MLA, on Monday alleged the raids by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on State Congress president D.K. Shivakumar and his brother were politically motivated.

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Khader said the BJP was afraid of losing the bypolls to Shira and Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituencies. Hence, it has orchestrated raids on Mr. Shivakumar and his brother D.K. Suresh.

Former MLC Ivan D’Souza said raids at different locations belonging to the brothers had no authentic reason behind them. He urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to order probe into the allegations against his son and relatives of receiving ₹17 crore kickback. “Let the Union government too order a probe against the BJP government in the State against the alleged ₹ 2,000 crore ‘Corona scam’,” he said.

Meanwhile, cadres of Dakshina Kannada district units of Youth INTUC and Youth Congress staged demonstrations in front of the District Congress office protesting the raids on Mr. Shivakumar. Chiranjeevi Anchan and Mithun Rai, presidents of respective units, led the protests.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a6njvy/article32777462.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06MNKHADER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cbi-raids-a-strategy-to-divert-attention-khader/article32777463.ece
123,2020/10/06,COVID-19 | Bengaluru’s active cases shot up tenfold in 90 days,"From July 1 to September 30 the number rose from 4,649 to 47,145

In 90 days - July 1 to September 30 - active cases in Bengaluru shot up by over ten times from 4,649 to 47,145. During the same period, Chennai reduced active cases from 22,781 to 11,323, Mumbai brought down its active cases from 29,715 to 26,663.

The six mega cities in India - Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai and Kolkata - collectively had 89,695 active cases on July 1. While Bengaluru contributed 5.2% of this, Mumbai’s share was the largest with 33.1% followed by Delhi with 30.1% and Chennai 25.4%. Ahmedabad and Kolkata contributed 4% and 2.2% respectively. Cities that have a population of over one million are classified as mega cities.

Ninety days later on September 30, all the six mega cities collectively had 1,21,500 active cases, a rise by 26.2%. Active cases in Bengaluru that shot up to 47,145 accounted for 38.8% of the total active cases amongst six mega cities (as on September 30). Mumbai’s active cases share dropped from 33.1% to 21.9% and Chennai’s 25.4% to 9.3%, according to an analysis by Project Jeevan Raksha, a public-private partnership that is analyzing COVID-19 trends across the country.

Surge in mortality

Another area of grave concern is Bengaluru’s increased share of mortality in the mega cities group. On June 30, Bengaluru had recorded 95 COVID-19 fatalities, which was 0.9% of total 10,098 COVID-19 deaths among the six mega cities. Whereas, on September 30, Bengaluru’s fatalities increased to 2,936, 12.3% of total COVID-19 23,955 deaths in six mega cities, according to the analysis.

While the rise in active cases and deaths in Bengaluru may sound alarming, one good thing is that the test positivity rate (TPR) of Bengaluru fell from 19% to 14% from July 1 to September 30.

Aggressive testing

Mysore Sanjeev, convenor of Jeevan Raksha, said aggressive ramp-up of testing and an accelerated unlocking process are the two key reasons for a surge in the cases in all mega cities including Bengaluru. Stating that Bengaluru’s Testing Per Million (TPM) population increased from 30,828 to 1,07,086 since August, he said, “This resulted in an increase in active cases. Since Unlock 1.0 to the current Unlock 5.0, efforts have been on to move towards normalcy by adhering to social distancing protocols. Unfortunately, a majority of people continue to lead their life in accordance with the pre-COVID-19 period flouting all norms of social distancing and mask-wearing.”

Giridhar R. Babu, member, State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee, said cities that saw a surge much earlier compared to Bengaluru managed to drop their active caseload to some extent in the last two months.

“With the case surge starting late in Bengaluru. It is only natural that the burden is higher here. Also, the city is increasing tests progressively. The case count is not of worry as long as the health system can handle it,” he said.

“Also, an increase in active cases indicates that people in newer outlying areas are getting infected. In the absence of a vaccine, the virus always finds uninfected prey in new areas,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fkxka2/article32777450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGMASK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bengalurus-active-cases-shot-up-tenfold-in-90-days/article32777451.ece
124,2020/10/06,"CLAT results out, bring disappointment to many","Thousands had filed objections over technical glitches in the test held on Sept. 28

The results of the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) 2020 were announced on Monday. But as soon as the results were announced, several candidates took to social media to express their disappointment with their scores.

Thousands of candidates had filed objections regarding the technical glitches in the test held on September 28. However, the Consortium of National Law Universities had said that not a single complaint was valid and they had done random checks of some of the audit trails which showed no errors.

On Monday, however, candidates said that they would not accept the results and said that a petition was filed in the Supreme Court which termed the test “erroneous, faulty, defective, discriminatory and violative of fundamental rights of the Constitution”. One of the candidates told The Hindu that she had taken a gap year to prepare for CLAT and was put to hardship because of the mistakes and errors that she had to encounter during the test. Sources said that over 40,000 objections were raised by candidates.

The candidate who secured the top rank in UG CLAT 2020 scored 127.25 out of 147 marks. Meanwhile, the highest mark in CLAT 2020 – PG was 72 out of 119 marks - shared by two candidates. Three UG CLAT and one of the PG CLAT questions were dropped by the consortium.

The Executive Committee of the Consortium of National Law Universities has resolved to give the candidates more time to complete the process of registration for counselling. A release issued by the consortium stated that an invite for counselling will be sent to approximately five times the number of seats in each category instead of three times as notified earlier.

“Candidates who do not complete the counselling registration process will not be considered for allotment of seat. Candidates are requested to go through the Counselling Guidelines notified on the consortium website and also regularly check the website for updates. The schedule notified by the consortium should be strictly adhered to. No extension of time for any of the processes will be granted by the consortium and also by the NLUs,” the release stated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/x15pti/article32777378.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGCLAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/clat-results-out-bring-disappointment-to-many/article32777379.ece
125,2020/10/06,Health workers engaged in COVID-19 duty prohibited from going on strike,"The Karnataka government on Monday prohibited strikes, non-cooperation and any other form of disobedience by public servants and health workers engaged in providing health services related to COVID-19.

In the wake of repeated instances of doctors, paramedics and health workers working for the government or hired on contractual basis going on strike and threatening to stop work, Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar on Monday issued an order prohibiting strikes.

“In my capacity as chairman of the State Executive Committee, I hereby prohibit strikes, non-cooperation, disobeying or refusal to work related to health services; non-submission of reports, non-compliance to the orders issued by the higher authorities by any public servant, health personnel, regular, contractual and outsourced employees of the Health Department, ” the Chief Secretary said in the Order.

Noting that the State government has declared COVID-19 as an epidemic under Section 3 of the Karnataka Epidemic Disease Ordinance, 2020, the Order said: “Disobeying or refusal of the work will amount to contravention of the provisions of the said Acts, Rules or Orders and will attract penal provisions specified in the Acts.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/health-workers-engaged-in-covid-19-duty-prohibited-from-going-on-strike/article32777370.ece
126,2020/10/06,"Shivakumar’s disproportionate assets worth ₹74.93 crore, says CBI","The FIR the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered on October 3 against Congress leader D.K. Shivakumar, based on which raids were conducted on Monday, says a preliminary inquiry prima facie found that the accused and his family members had amassed disproportionate assets worth ₹74.93 crore from April 1, 2013 to April 30, 2018 — financial years when Mr. Shivakumar was a Minister in the State.

Mr. Shivakumar and his family members were found to be in possession of assets worth ₹33.92 crore at the beginning of the checking period. By the end of the period, their assets were to the tune of ₹162.53 crore. During this period, Mr. Shivakumar and his family members amassed wealth to the tune of ₹128.6 crore. It is further disclosed that their income and total receipts during the check period was to the tune of ₹166.79 crore, and their expenditure was ₹113.12 crore.

“Therefore, they are found to be in possession of assets disproportionate to the tune of ₹74.93 crore, which is 44.93% of their total income during the check period,” the FIR states. The assets the CBI has considered is what was declared by Mr. Shivakumar in his election affidavits.

The FIR names only Shivakumar as an accused in the case and books him under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/shivakumars-disproportionate-assets-worth-7493-crore-says-cbi/article32777329.ece
127,2020/10/06,Earlier raids on D.K. Shivakumar also coincided with elections,"Over the past three years, Congress strongman and KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar’s brushes with the Central investigating agencies have come just before crucial elections. If the Income Tax Department searches in August 2017 were ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls from Gujarat where Ahmed Patel, a confidante of the Gandhi family, was seeking re-election, in 2019 Mr. Shivakumar’s arrest by the Enforcement Directorate and the subsequent 50 days he spent in Tihar Jail came before the crucial bypolls to 13 Assembly constituencies.

The timing of the early-morning searches on Monday at 14 locations, including the Congress leader’s residence, by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) sleuths is being interpreted by the Congress as another attempt to distract Mr. Shivakumar before the byelections to the Assembly constituencies of Sira and Rajarajeshwari Nagar, scheduled for November 3.

“The BJP has always tried to indulge in vindictive politics and mislead public attention. The latest CBI raid on Mr. Shivakumar’s house is another attempt to derail our preparation for the bypolls. I strongly condemn this,” Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah tweeted soon after the searches commenced.

Sources close to the Vokkaliga leader said they believe that the searches follow reports of unfavourable poll results in the Assembly constituencies as Mr. Shivakumar and his brother D.K. Suresh, MP from Bengaluru Rural, were putting in “their best efforts” to secure the Congress’ victory. “Mr. Shivakumar has shown his capacity as a strategist when he has ensured bypoll victories for the Congress in Gundlupet and Kundgol Assembly constituency, and in Ballari Lok Sabha constituency in the past where he was in charge. This is his first election as KPCC president,” a source said.

However, the Vokkaliga Ministers in the B.S. Yediyurappa Cabinet distanced the party from the CBI raids. Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar, who is believed to be not in good terms with Mr. Shivakumar, asked, “What would happen to the BJP government even if hypothetically we lost both seats? The government is already enjoying majority and its survival does not depend on the election outcome. There is no reason to target him. The BJP does not believe in political interference...”

Meanwhile, foe-turned-friend of the Congress leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said, “It is true that in such circumstances, generally it is termed political vendetta. There is nothing to fear if the political representatives work diligently. If we do not work well, we should be ready to face the investigation.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/earlier-raids-on-dk-shivakumar-also-coincided-with-elections/article32777322.ece
128,2020/10/06,"CBI raids on D.K. Shivakumar violate HC order, says KPCC legal cell","The disproportionate assets case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against Congress leader D.K. Shivakumar and the subsequent raids on premises linked to him violate a recent order of the High Court of Karnataka, senior advocate and Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) legal cell chief A.S. Ponnanna claimed on Monday.

“D.K. Shivakumar has challenged the State government’s September 25, 2019 order giving consent to the CBI to probe corruption allegations against him under Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. The Karnataka High Court had given an interim order on September 30, 2020 stating that no further coercive action should be taken in the case till further orders. Thus, the CBI registering a case and the subsequent raids are in violation of this order,” he said.

Mr. Ponnanna reached Mr. Shivakumar’s Sadashivanagar residence as the CBI raids were on and tried to meet CBI officers to appraise them of the High Court order. However, he was not allowed in. Eventually, the KPCC legal cell submitted a copy of the order at the CBI office in Ganga Nagar.

However, sources in the CBI defended the bureau’s action, saying it was not a party to the writ petition and hence the order was not binding on it. However, Mr. Ponnanna said that since the writ petition had questioned the consent the State government had given for the CBI probe itself, the State government was party to the case and not the CBI.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cbi-raids-on-dk-shivakumar-violate-hc-order-says-kpcc-legal-cell/article32777055.ece
129,2020/10/06,Will CBI raids on D.K. Shivakumar impact bypolls in Karnataka?,"The recent CBI raids in the run-up to bypolls might again lead to Vokkaliga consolidation in his favour, the Congress hopes and some sections in the BJP fear.

The State’s political circles are waiting to see if the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raids on Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar and his brother D.K. Suresh, MP from Bengaluru Rural, will impact the outcome of the bypolls in Sira and Rajarajeshwari Nagar. In both constituencies, which have a sizeable Vokkaliga population, the CBI action and its timing could become a factor during polling, believe Congress leaders.

The Congress has been seeing an opportunity to win the Sira seat as the Janata Dal (S), which held the seat till the death of its legislator B. Satyanarayana, is grappling with too many aspirants, which can upset its chances. The Congress leaders in Tumakuru have also closed ranks, giving hopes of a victory for the party. The party is also working on a strategy to win the R.R. Nagar seat, where the BJP is dealing with two strong contenders for candidature.

“Though the politically motivated searches will not affect party’s election preparations, they might have an impact on the results. We are confident about both seats. That way we see today’s searches as a diversion from the protests over Hathras. This is also a message to leaders from an autocratic government,” said KPCC working president Eshwar Khandre.

Party sources said that Sira and R.R. Nagar have 60,000 and 72,000 Vokkaliga votes each, and the timing of the CBI searches could end up in a consolidation of Vokkaliga votes, besides the traditional Congress votes. It may be recalled that Vokkaligas had taken out a mega protest rally in the city following Mr. Shivakumar’s arrest in a money laundering case by the Enforcement Directorate in September 2019. That only worked for Mr. Shivakumar, as the Congress rallied behind him and he was appointed president of the KPCC in March 2020.

The recent CBI raids in the run-up to bypolls might again lead to Vokkaliga consolidation in his favour, the Congress hopes and some sections in the BJP fear. The saffron party being jittery over the raids assuming caste colour was evident in how the party fielded Vokkaliga leaders to distance itself from the CBI action. Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan and Ministers C.T. Ravi (who is also a BJP national general secretary) and K. Sudhakar aggressively distanced the party from the raids.

Party strategists close to the Chief Minister said that the raids would definitely impact on the caste equations in the two constituencies and that they were working on ways to counter a consolidation of Vokkaligas in favour of the Congress. “D.K. Shivakumar is not the only Vokkaliga leader in the State. But he is prone to claim victimhood every time there is action against him by various agencies. We are aware that we need to counter this narrative that he puts forth,” a BJP strategist said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6sfii2/article32777041.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGRAID2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/will-cbi-raids-on-dk-shivakumar-raids-impact-bypolls-in-karnataka/article32777042.ece

Blaming the B.S. Yediyurappa government in the State for allowing the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to search his residence, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar on Monday said he has been targeted by Central agencies before elections.

“Now that there are bypolls, they have returned. Till the end of elections, these kind of inconveniences will be there. The Income Tax Department searched my premises ahead of the Gujarat Rajya Sabha elections in 2017; the Enforcement Directorate put me in jail before the bypolls in 2019; and now the CBI has come to search me before another bypolls,” he told party workers gathered outside his house, soon after the CBI completed its search. “We will have to reply to this in the polls. Go back to the booth level and work for the party.”

He said that when the CBI wrote to the State government seeking permission for a probe, the Advocate General had opined that the case may be handed over to the Anti-Corruption Bureau. “So far, no disproportionate assets case against any legislator has been handed over to the CBI. The Chief Minister could have given the case to the ACB. I do not know what was the pressure on Mr. Yediyurappa,” Mr. Shivakumar said.

Later, addressing presspersons, he said, “You [the CM] gave permission to the CBI. Tell me if there has been any inquiry, judicial commission established against me in the last 30 years of my political life, until the I-T raids, which are anyway politically motivated.”

He also said that he would not succumb to any pressure tactics or be silenced, and that he was capable of answering the investigating agencies. “I don’t blame the CBI officials. They have only done their duty, as instructed by their political masters. I will reply to every question they ask and will cooperate. Ultimately, there are the courts,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nj4gzo/article32778651.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGDKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/now-that-there-are-bypolls-in-karnataka-sleuths-have-come-again-dk-shivakumar/article32776972.ece
131,2020/10/06,Mani faction in talks with LDF,"Initial round of discussion in view of the coming local body elections

As Kerala Congress factions set to celebrate the 56th formation day of the party on October 9, speculations over the entry of the Jose K. Mani-led Kerala Congress (M) into the Left Democratic Front (LDF) on the occasion have once again gathered momentum.

Sources in the Kerala Congress (M) led by Mr. Mani have confirmed that their leader has called an online meeting of party steering committee members on the formation day to discuss the future course of action. They, however, do not expect a formal announcement regarding the party's entry into the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led coalition on the occasion.

The party, according to them, is yet to work out a seat-sharing plan with the LDF, especially in local bodies. At the same time, the initial round of talks with the LDF in view of the upcoming elections is already on.

‘‘For instance, the Kerala Congress (M) had contested in 11 divisions in the Kottayam district panchayat in the previous election and seeks to contest from the same number of seats in the upcoming election as well. A consensus on this, however, is yet to be arrived at,’’ they pointed out.

Coalition partners in the LDF, especially the Nationalist Congress Party and the Communist Party of India, however, are yet to respond favourably to the demands put forth by the Kerala Congress (M).

Meanwhile, the Mani group sought to dismiss reports about Mr. Mani quitting the Rajya Sabha membership before joining the LDF camp. Since Mr. Mani was elected unopposed to the Rajya Sabha, there is no scope for any confusion whatsoever', they pointed out.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mani-faction-in-talks-with-ldf/article32786514.ece
132,2020/10/06,Mars lights up night sky as it comes closest to Earth,"The planet will be visible for much of 2020 and early next year

Skywatchers in Kerala are delighted that Mars will be visible to the naked eye in a rare celestial configuration that coincides with World Space Week which is observed from October 4 to 10.

Mars rises by 7 p.m. and sets about 7 a.m. and can be seen in the easterly direction of the sky as a reddish spot. The red planet can easily be identified because it does not twinkle like stars. Mars can be observed in the eastern sky between 9 p. m. and 5 a. m., says GangadharanVellur, a skywatcher who runs an observatory at Payyannur.

P.N. Thankachan, secretary of the State unit of the Breakthrough Science Society in Kottayam, says the iron oxide on the surface of Mars gives it a red complexion.

This time, Mars's orbit came closest to Earth on October 6, at 62.07 million km. Mars will be visible for much of 2020 and early next year. In 2003, Mars made its closest approach to Earth in nearly 60,000 years. It would not be that close again until the year 2287. The red planet comes close enough for exceptional viewing only once or twice every 15 or 17 years. Next Mars Close Approach is in 2022.

If Earth and Mars had perfectly circular orbits, their minimum distance would always be the same. However, they have elliptical paths. In addition, gravitational tugging by planets constantly changes the shape of their orbits a little bit. The orbits of Mars and Earth are also slightly tilted with respect to each other. While Earth only takes 365 days to complete an orbit around the Sun, Mars takes 687 days.

Along with Mars, skywatchers will also be able to see Jupiter and Saturn in the western sky from 8 p.m. about five degrees above the horizon as bright balls, which do not twinkle.

133,2020/10/06,Dismal performance of Kerala students in Joint Entrance Exam,"Lack of orientation and focus among middle class families on national-level engineering entrance tests cited

The performance of candidates from Kerala at the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) and (Advanced), 2020 has been dismal when compared to other States in national-level rankings.

Several reasons have been attributed to the poor ranks of candidates seeking admission to National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs)

""A major reason is the lack of orientation and focus among middle class families on national-level engineering entrance tests. Our students have to compete with counterparts from other States who prepare for the JEE from Class VIII or IX,"" says K.A. Abdul Nazeer, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, and former Chairman - UG Admissions, National Institute of Technology, Calicut, (NIT-C).

He says upper middle class families who are aware of the JEE show a reluctance to send their children to study outside the State. ""It is neither the poor quality of teaching methodology nor the ineffective teaching methods of mathematics which is generally believed to be a factor that deprives Kerala students from competing at the national exams,"" he adds.

Preference

Arun Viswanthan, branch head of a coaching centre, says parental focus in Kerala is more on medical studies than engineering colleges. “That is why candidates from Kerala perform better in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to MBBS, BDS courses and other undergraduate medical courses in India,"" he says.

The difficulty level of the JEE (Main) and (Advanced) could be tide over by specialised and targeted coaching methods. ""Besides, the mindset of parents who want their children only to score A plus in all subjects in Plus Two exams should also change,"" Mr. Viswanthan says.

Another reason, he says, is that parents and students feel that engineering has no scope in a State like Kerala without industrial development. ""This is unlike in other southern States and north Indian cities,"" he adds.

Had it not been for the 50 % home quota, candidates from Kerala would have to struggle for admission at the NIT-C as well. Incidentally, the opening rank and closing ranking in the home quota after the seventh round in the most sought-after computer science branch at the NIT-C in the general category last year were 2,201 and 11, 022 respectively.

""To improve the examination skills of students, the KEAM entrance tests should be done away with and instead the allotment process at engineering colleges in the State should for done exclusively for Kerala students through the JEE (Main) ranks,"" Prof. Nazeer says, adding that then candidates would not have to appear for two engineering tests.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dismal-performance-of-kerala-students-in-joint-entrance-exam/article32786481.ece
134,2020/10/06,"Focus on identifying, isolating symptomatic people","7,871 new cases detected when 60,494 samples tested in 24 hours

COVID-19 disease transmission in the State seemed to show a slight dip on Tuesday with the test positivity rate remaining at 13% and 7,871 new cases detected when 60,494 samples were tested in 24 hours. The number of recoveries reported on Tuesday was 4,981.

The State’s cumulative burden of COVID-19 now stands at 2,42,799. With total recoveries till date being 1,54,092, the number of active cases currently in hospitals is 87,738. The number of patients who are critically ill and in ICUs has increased to 557, while those patients put on ventilator support have surged to 171.

The State’s COVID toll now stands at 884, having added another 25 deaths to the official list of COVID deaths. Nine of these deaths were reported in Thiruvananthapuram, five in Kollam, four in Malappuram, three in Kottayam, two in Kannur and one each in Alappuzha and Kasaragod.

Over 97% of the new cases reported on Tuesday – 7,671 out of the new 7,871 cases – are locally acquired infections, which include infections reported in 111 health-care workers. In 640 cases, the source of infection could not be ascertained.

Among districts, Thiruvananthapuram reported 989 cases, Malappuram 854, Kollam 845, Ernakulam 837, Thrissur 757, Kozhikode 736, Kannur 545, Palakkad 520, Kottayam 427, Alappuzha 424, Kasaragod 416, Pathanamthitta 330, Wayanad 135 and Idukki 56 cases.

Briefing media, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the Sate will be focussing more on identifying and isolating symptomatic people and on stringently implementing the COVID protocol in markets and other public places.

All those who test negative in rapid antigen tests but are symptomatic will be retested using RT-PCR. All districts have been directed to take strong steps to ensure that the test positivity rate is kept below 10%. Directions have also been given to ensure special care for pregnant women, children and those on dialysis who might test positive for COVID-19.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/focus-on-identifying-isolating-symptomatic-people/article32786467.ece
135,2020/10/06,State pandemic curve defies predictions,"Agony over the contagion may extend over many more months, say epidemiologists

With the estimated effective reproduction number for COVID-19 (a measure of the disease’s transmission potential) in the State still remaining high at 1.21, it is possible that Kerala’s agony over COVID-19 could be extended over many more months, epidemiologists and public health professionals now say.

On one hand it spreads out the infection over a period, helping the State to keep the case fatality down. On the other hand, the adverse impact on economy and COVID-related psycho-social issues could be prolonged.

There is speculation that Onam celebrations and the widespread political agitations that followed soon after, may have taken the epidemic curve to a new trajectory, with the result that predictions about the epidemic’s peak have become uncertain.

“Compared to the previous weeks, the doubling time has increased slightly and the case estimations, while still significantly high, have come down a notch. The new restrictions imposed by the State and the general sense of fear might bring down cases slightly in the next two weeks, it is hoped. However, the upcoming Sabarimala pilgrimage could upset all that and take the State to another peak,” says a senior public health professional.

Whatever be the interventions at disease containment, the epidemic has a natural logic which cannot be defied. Case numbers will continue to go up and one can only amp up the preparedness to meet it face on, he points out.

“Accuracy of projections depends on how unbiased the data are. We are not sure how unbiased the test positivity data are because testing is generally done in people who are symptomatic/high risk and the question is whether we should expect that in the general population. For projections to be accurate, we need data collected in a randomised surveillance mode,” says K.P. Aravindan, a public health professional.

“We thought that we would be peaking by October. But the results of the second round of ICMR’s sero surveillance study done in three districts in the State have now prompted a re-think that the peak is still far away. The sero prevalence rate of 0.8% in August in Kerala against the national average of 6.6 % seems way too low,” he adds.

But then, ICMR’s sero prevalence study was not State specific and it was done only to estimate a national average. The sample size was low at 1,281 samples and the districts covered were Thrissur, Ernakulam, and Palakkad.

Underestimation?

It is possible that the ICMR sample may have given an underestimation of actual sero prevalence in the State because it does not include data from a district such as Thiruvananthapuram where disease transmission has been intense in coastal areas where huge clusters had developed.

“Which is why it is important for the State to do a well-designed sero prevalence study on its own in all districts, with the help of any scientific institution. It will help us give unbiased data, which can also help us make better case projections,” Dr. Aravindan says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-pandemic-curve-defies-predictions/article32786455.ece
136,2020/10/06,Kingpins in gold smuggling case held in UAE,"Faisal Fareed and Rabins Hameed in custody, tells NIA court

Faisal Fareed and Rabins Hameed, two “main conspirators” in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case, have been arrested in the UAE.

The UAE authorities, who arrested the two accused, have informed the National Investigation Agency (NIA) that strict action would be taken against all conspirators as the “accused in the case had attempted to damage the friendly relations between India and the UAE,” the NIA submitted before the Special Judge considering the case on Tuesday.

It was while opposing the bail plea of Muhammad Shafi, an accused in the case, that the NIA made the revelations.

The UAE authorities had revealed that the crimes were committed by Fareed and Hameed pursuant to the conspiracy hatched with the other accused who were arrested in India. They were on the run in the UAE.

All the accused had knowingly funded, facilitated and smuggled gold through the diplomatic cargo of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram by forging or deceitfully obtaining the authorisation certificates from the UAE diplomats, it stated.

The NIA said it had moved the Interpol for issuing Blue Corner notices against the “fugitives,” Fareed and Hameed, Siddiqul Akbar, Ahamed Kutty, Raju, and Mohammad Shameer, for securing their presence in India.

The request for mutual legal assistance is being finalised for obtaining the evidence in this case from the UAE, as a major part of the transactions, especially funding through reverse hawala and purchase of smuggled gold, had taken place in the UAE.

Multiple occasions

The agency submitted that the investigations revealed that Shafi was one of the prime accused who invested, arranged and facilitated the smuggling of gold through the diplomatic baggage of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on multiple occasions with the other accused in the case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kingpins-in-gold-smuggling-case-held-in-uae/article32786055.ece

138,2020/10/06,Suspension of MCH staff Revoked,"The move was over the alleged negligence in the care of a bed-ridden patient

The government has issued orders revoking the suspension orders it had issued to two head nurses and the COVID Nodal Officer at Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital (MCH), over the alleged negligence committed in the care of a bed-ridden patient Anilkumar, who had been admitted to MCH under the Orthopaedics department.

At the same time, the government, on the basis of a detailed enquiry report filed by the Director of Medical Education, has recommended disciplinary action against the Unit Chief (Unit 5) of Orthopaedics department, Thiruvananthapuram MCH, under whose care the patient had been admitted.

The report has also pinned responsibility for compromising the care of the bed-ridden patient, on the nursing staff as well as the supervisory officers

The DME has been directed to initiate disciplinary action against supervisory head nurses, the staff nurses, and nursing assistants on duty for the last three days.

The report by DME states that maximum patient care should have been ensured with available resources by doing time structuring and proper prioritisation of patients needing assisted care, as is being done in other Medical Colleges.

The suspension of the healthcare workers had provoked the entire medical faculty into a strike across the State for the past two days. They had put the blame for the unfortunate incident on the fact that the hospital was acutely short of support staff to give proper patient care.

They had threatened to launch an indefinite strike boycotting all non-COVID duties if the suspension order was not revoked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/suspension-of-mch-staff-revoked/article32785743.ece

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated 12 family health centres (FHCs) in the district on Tuesday.

Twelve primary health centres (PHCs) were raised as family health centres as part of the Ardram Mission. Besides giving a boost to public health services, these are expected to be important in COVID-19 prevention activities.

The family health centres have come up at Vattiyurkavu, Jagathy, Keezhattingal, Kattakada, Kallikad Old (Veeranakavu), Panavoor, Aanamkudi, Pulimath, Tholicode, Madavoor, Kallikad New (Neyyar Dam), and Idava.

The Chief Minister, in his address, said with the upgrade of the PHCs into family health centres, significant changes had resulted in the health sectors in those areas. They were playing a significant role in COVID-19 prevention too, he said.

As part of the Ardram Mission, 170 family health centres were the target in the first phase and 503 in the next. Across both phases, a total of 461 PHC were transformed into family health centres. The rest would be completed soon, Mr. Vijayan said.

The Minister said setting up multiple medical colleges was not enough. Well-equipped super-speciality hospitals were the need of the hour. The government had succeeded in bringing the super-specialities of cardiology, neurology, and nephrology to district general hospitals. This had made expert care available without heading to medical colleges.

Besides these three super-specialities, a urology department too had been set up at General Hospital here. The ₹7.5-crore cath lab set up here was part of making available super-speciality facilities, Ms. Shylaja said.

Sanction had been given for ₹143.06 crore for the first phase of the master plan for the hospital’s development. This phase would include out-patient department, trauma and emergency department, radiology, lab, blood bank, and service block.

141,2020/10/06,Succour that’s just a phone call away,"Vayokshema call centre, launched to aid the elderly, has so far received 15,000 calls

More than 25 elderly who live alone in the district have asked to be rehabilitated.

This information has been gleaned through calls made and received at the Vayokshema call centre (ph: 0471 2778450) launched to ascertain and address the health problems and other needs of the elderly in the district. Details of three lakh elderly in the district were collected earlier in the pandemic by the government.

The call centre, attached to the district cell for the elderly, was launched a month ago. So far, nearly 15,000 calls have been made and received at the call centre, which is part of the Grand Care project of the Social Justice Department.

Sociology and psychology higher secondary teachers, anganwadi workers and supervisors, and volunteers handle the calls. Interventions are made with the support of the National Health Mission under the Health Department, Kerala Social Security Mission, Women and Child Development Department, Local Self-government Department, and the Kudumbashree, says District Social Justice Officer Gibson Raj.

Focus at present is on reaching out to the elderly who live alone in the district and have no one to look after them or face financial difficulties or other such problems. So far, more than 12,103 elderly who live alone have been contacted.

In one such case, an elderly man from Thirupuram who had no one to look after him developed an ulcer on his leg that then became infested with maggots. His health was assessed by a medical team and moved into the reverse quarantine centre for the elderly at Vallakkadavu where he is recovering. He is now set to be moved to an old-age home. Other such elderly may also be moved into such institutions.

If the elderly are in need of medical consultation, the call centre will arrange it through telemedicine as part of the eSanjeevani project. If medical attention, including for lifestyle disorders, is deemed necessary, then one of the eight teams deployed by the Kerala Social Security Mission (KSSM) as part of Vayomithram across the district visits them at home. Medicines are arranged through primary health centres. If there is no one to pick the medicines up, these are delivered to the doorstep through ASHA workers. Medicines not available through PHCs are delivered by the KSSM teams, says Mr. Raj.

The call centre is also paying attention to the mental health of the elderly who are alone. Psychological problems arising from the extended reverse quarantine period are addressed through telecounselling. More interventions may also be needed. One elderly man who would rip at his clothes and whose wife refused to take care of him too has been moved to the reverse quarantine centre. The department is now mulling what other steps can be taken.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/succour-thats-just-a-phone-call-away/article32785446.ece

The capital district recorded 989 cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday with testing picking up after a lull during the weekend.

Bringing much relief, the recovery rate remained on the higher side in the district as 850 people tested negative on the day. The number of active cases stood at 12,518 in Thiruvananthapuram.

The significant rise in COVID-19 caseload from 700 the previous day is attributed to the rise in the number of tests from 3,736 to 5,797. The district administration has tested 3,35,972 people so far.

The death toll also continued to grow at an alarming rate with nine more people succumbing to the disease. With the deaths of the natives of Vettucaud (70-year-old), Nemom (63), Valiyathura (64), Nellivila (59), Kovalam (37), Amaravila (62), Chembazhanthy (71), Thirumala (61), and Fort (78) being attributed to COVID-19, the count rose to 258.

Among those who tested positive, 892 people acquired the infection through local transmission, while the health authorities were yet to trace the source of infection in 81 other cases. Sixteen health workers have also been diagnosed with the disease.

According to the official statistics, 146 people aged above 60 years and 103 children aged below 15 years are among those infected on the day. The worst-affected among local bodies in the district were Thiruvananthapuram Corporation (346 cases), Neyyattinkara Municipality (71), Balaramapuram (32), Vilavoorkkal (27) and Karakulam (26) grama panchayats. In Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, the highest number of cases were reported in Manacaud (17 cases), Thampanoor (16), and Medical College (12) wards.

Eight more police officers, including four attached to the Museum police and three attached to the Nedumangad police, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the district.

During his daily briefing, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan pointed out that the case per million rose in Thiruvananthapuram during the last week. The doubling rate of COVID-19 has, however, increased in the district unlike some others in the State.

He was releasing the first audited balance sheet of the Kerala State Cooperative Bank (KSCB) after merger with 13 district cooperative banks.

145,2020/10/06,CM and IMA spar over State’s COVID handling,"Medical body says it did some plain speak about the need to do much more on the critical care front

A strongly worded statement from the Indian Medical Association (IMA), pointing out the lacunae in the State’s preparedness to face the crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and accusing the government of leaving pandemic management to bureaucrats rather than health experts seems to have got the goat of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who has in turn accused that those criticising the government have a warped mindset.

IMA had issued the statement in the background of the agitation of doctors on Monday, accusing the government of demoralising healthcare workers and pointing out the issues in COVID-19 management.

The attack on the Health Department’s COVID-19 management was not taken kindly by Mr. Vijayan, who, while inaugurating the new family health centres, accused IMA of becoming “self-styled health experts” and “trying to mislead the public about the Health Department”.

He claimed that the Health Department had been managing COVID-19 fully on the basis of scientific advice and with necessary caution and said that those accusing the Health Department of mismanagement had vested interests in mind.

When contacted, IMA leaders maintained that they had only done some plain speak and that they had chosen not to mince words because the crisis involving COVID-19 was real and with the number of serious patients going up, the State needed to do much more than what was being done now on the critical care front.

“All available ICU facilities in the State are nearly 80 % full now. In the next two weeks, we fear that the situation will go out of hand. The government needs to focus better on critical care capacity building and ensuring more human resources,” IMA State secretary P. Gopikumar said.

The Chief Minister, during his evening briefing, also said that the State government was consulting the IMA on many things and their suggestions were being taken. However, IMA did not seem to be enjoying the same stature with the Union Health Ministry or with other State governments, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cm-and-ima-spar-over-states-covid-handling/article32785042.ece

Alleging that the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 sought to homogenise education in the country, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said its implementation goes against two key driving forces of the country — federalism and inclusion.

He was speaking while inaugurating a web rally organised by the Kerala Vidhyabhyasa Samithi, a platform of Left-aligned service organisations, demanding the withdrawal of the policy on Tuesday.

Mr. Vijayan said formulation of the policy without incorporating the States’ views went against the spirit of the federal framework. “Federalism can thrive only when the States are empowered to fine-tune national policies in line with ground realities and diverse views, even while retaining basic framework evolved by the Centre. However, the Centre has chosen to centralise decision-making powers and weaken the plural nature that existed in education systems in each State,” he said.

He also flagged the proposed plan to identify ‘aspirational district’, which will require special interventions. While the NEP 2020 calls for declaring regions with large sections of socially and economically disadvantaged groups as Special Education Zones, the Chief Minister cautioned that the concept envisaged bringing such areas under the supervision of Central agencies, further posing danger to the federal structure.

According to Mr. Vijayan, the NEP that aspires to create a centralised system from the pre-primary to the research level will wipe off academic autonomy.

Besides, the plan to replace the apex advisory body Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) with Rashtriya Shiksha Ayog will lead to excessive centralisation of powers. While the CABE ensured equal representation of each State, the proposed body is likely to be an exclusive panel with several States left out.

He also blamed the Centre for making no attempt to address the reasons that contributed to the high drop-out rates at each stages of the education system. While around 10% of the students dropped out at the primary level, the corresponding rates increased to 21% and 43.5% before the secondary and higher secondary school levels respectively.

All Kerala Private College Teachers’ Association (AKPCTA) general secretary C. Padmanabhan presided over the meeting. Left Democratic Front (LDF) convener A. Vijayaraghavan, former MP K.N. Balagopal, Kerala School Teachers Association (KSTA) general secretary K.C. Harikrishnan, Association of Kerala Government College Teachers (AKGCT) general secretary N.

148,2020/10/06,Dancing in protest against caste discrimination,"Cultural casteism by Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi alleged

The Collectorate premises here, which witnesses a wide variety of protests by socio-political organisations, saw a unique protest by a male dancer on Tuesday morning.

Jishnu Vijayan, a member of the Samskarika Sahiti from Shoranur, staged a Mohiniyattam performance in front of the Collectorate, inviting the attention of a lot of people. Mr. Jishnu’s protest was against the alleged caste discrimination by the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi.

Recent incident

R.L.V. Ramakrishnan, classical dancer and younger brother of the late actor Kalabhavan Mani, had attempted suicide a few days ago alleging caste discrimination by the office-bearers of the Sangeetha Nataka Akademi headed by actor K.P.A.C. Lalita.

Mr. Jishnu said that the ignominy suffered by Mr. Ramakrishnan was an insult to Kerala’s cultural sphere.

Inaugurating the programme held under the banner of the Samskara Sahiti, its district chairman Boban Mattumantha demanded that the akademi heal the wound suffered by Kerala by taking appropriate action against those responsible.

“The Akademi’s alleged attempts to shoo away artistes on the basis of caste will ruin the cultural values the State achieved in recent decades. It is an indication of the beginning of the State’s return to cultural casteism,” said Mr. Mattumantha.

‘An insult’

He said the Akademi office-bearers who maintained a cavalier attitude to artistes from lower castes were an insult to the entire State.

151,2020/10/06,ISRO plans PSLV mission in Nov.,"Virtual launch control centre being set up at VSSC to remotely carry out system checkouts

Forced to put off space missions due to COVID-19, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is hoping to push through at least one Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) mission this year - in November - from Sriharikota.

To facilitate the mission with minimum movement of personnel to the spaceport, the space agency is setting up a ‘virtual launch control centre’ at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) at Thumba here.

A replica of the mission control centre at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, the virtual facility will enable ISRO to remotely carry out system checkouts on the launch vehicle from Thiruvananthapuram prior to the mission.

“Of course, we will still need personnel at Sriharikota for the actual integration and further pre-launch operations. But this way, the number of personnel who have to physically travel to Sriharikota for a mission can be cut down by 70 to 80%,” an official said.

Hoping to make up for lost time, the space agency hopes to have the PSLV C-49 mission (RISAT-2BR2 radar imaging satellite) in November.

The COVID-19 outbreak had upset ISRO’s launch schedule for this year. In fact, ISRO centres in Thiruvananthapuram had remained shut for nearly two months from March 23 in view of the pandemic.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) should clarify whether it stood by the charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, levelled against the second-rung accused mentioned in the First Information Report of the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case.

The NIA special judge asked the Assistant Solicitor General (ASG) P. Vijayakumar to explain whether the investigation agency continued to subscribe to the charges of terror funding against the accused or it had other cases against the accused. The ASG submitted to the court that he shall reply to the specific questions raised by the court on Wednesday.

The court raised the questions to the NIA while considering the bail plea of Muhammad Shafi, P.T. Abdu, Muhammad Anwar, Hamjad Ali, Afsal, and Muhammad Shameem.

Arguments today

The ASG submitted that he could not go through the case diary and furnish the replies for the questions raised by the court on Monday as some of his associates in the office had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. He also offered to present his arguments regarding the case diary on Wednesday.

The court said it shall examine the case diary, which was submitted by the NIA on Tuesday, and return it to the investigating officer in the case to facilitate the ASG to study the documents.

Incidentally, the court had on Monday asked the NIA to substantiate the charges levelled against the second-run accused in the case, failing which it would be inclined to consider the bail application of the accused favourably.

The court also wanted the agency to delineate the first and second-line accused in the case.

Swapna seeks bail

Meanwhile, Swapna Suresh, the second accused in the case booked by the NIA, moved her bail application in the court. The court will consider the bail application on Monday.

Kottayam girl Ayswarya Alex along with other applicants has been invited to join British Deputy High Commissioner for Karnataka and Kerala Jeremy Pilmore-Bedford for a conversation with women leaders from the region to mark International Day of the Girl Child.

A final-year BDS student at the Maharishi Markandeshwar College of Dental Science and Research in Haryana, Ms. Alex has won the opportunity after emerging top from the Kerala- Karnataka region in a pan-India competition conducted by the UK’s diplomatic mission last month. The contest, which was open to women in the 18-23 age group, invited applicants to post a one-minute video on “what global challenges and opportunities do you see for gender equality in the age of COVID-19.”

Citing the example of her mother — a housewife — Ms. Alex asserted in her video that the digital age presented several opportunities for women in the form of online learning and online business. “The video was posted on September 13 and a couple of weeks later, I received a communication on behalf of the British Deputy High Commission in Bengaluru, seeking to confirm my engagement with the Deputy High Commissioner,” she said.

Exciting engagement

Inviting Ms. Alex to join Jeremy Pilmore - Bedford for a series of virtual calls from 9 a.m to 12.30 p.m., an official communication from the mission said it planned to host her ‘for exciting engagements such as an introduction to the British High Commission’s work in India, an all-staff meeting with the members of the British Deputy High Commission and an engagement with women leaders to speak about women’s issues and ways to work together’.

154,2020/10/06,No proof of electrical short circuit: forensic report,"Controversy over the cause of Secretariat fire resurfaces

A forensic examination of two electrical devices recovered from the scene of the controversial fire at the Secretariat here in August reportedly found no indication of an electrical malfunction, according to a recent court filing.

A senior police officer told The Hindu that investigators had collected 45 material objects from the scene of the fire for criminological examination to determine the cause of the blaze.

The forensic laboratory had examined two items and submitted its preliminary finding in court in a sealed cover. It was in the process of reviewing the rest of the evidence.

Final conclusion

The police would reach a final conclusion only after analysing the forensic results in entirety. He said preliminary evidence pointed to fire caused by an electrical short circuit. The police were yet to stumble upon any evidence suggesting sabotage or arson.

The Congress and the BJP said the court filing belied the claim of the State government that electrical short circuit had caused the “mysterious” fire.

Oppn. charge

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the forensic report had lent credence to the suspicion that the fire was an act of sabotage to destroy evidence in the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case.

The fire had consumed records relating to transactions of the State government with foreign entities, foreign visits by Ministers, duty exemption granted to foreign missions to import goods and details of persons accorded VIP Status, he alleged.

The government feared that Central law enforcement agencies would seek those files as part of their investigation into the case. Hence, in a preemptive move, the government had destroyed the files, Mr Chennithala said and demanded a judicial inquiry into the incident.

BJP State president K. Surendran said the report pointed to a deep-rooted conspiracy to destroy evidence in the gold smuggling case. The economic offence, which had the tacit approval of higher-ups in the government, had profound national security implications.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-proof-of-electrical-short-circuit-forensic-report/article32784281.ece
155,2020/10/06,Panel suggests limiting pilgrims during Sabarimala season,"Govt. to take decision on online darshan in consultation with Tantri

Allowing pilgrims only through Pampa, limiting the number of pilgrims to 1,000 on weekdays and 2,000 on weekends, and making COVID-19-negative certificate mandatory are among the recommendations made by the high-level committee for the Mandala-Makaravilakku pilgrimage season at the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple that begins on November 16.

Online darshan and allowing only pilgrims in the 10-60 age group and those in the 60-65 age group who produce a health certificate stating that they have no health issues are also part of the suggestions made by the committee headed by Chief Secretary Viswas Mehta in its report submitted to the government. The report suggests that 5,000 pilgrims can be allowed for Mandala Puja and Makaravilakku.

Guidelines

Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran said on Tuesday that a decision on online darshan would be taken only after holding discussions with the Tantri and the temple authorities. The government would look into the recommendations and issue guidelines for the smooth conduct of the two-month pilgrimage season, he said.

Registration

All the pilgrims will have to register on the portal www.covid19jagratha.kerala.nic.in and upload COVID-19-negative certificate 48 hours before darshan. In view of the pandemic, testing facilities would be set up by the Health Department enroute Pampa, preferably at Nilakkal, as pilgrims from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and other States are expected.

Trekking via the traditional path and bathing in the Pampa would not be allowed. Devotees would not get the same ghee given for Neyyabhishekam.

Monthly puja

The Minister said the entry from Pampa to the temple would be based on virtual queue. The possibility of keeping the temple open for more days during the Malayalam months would be looked into in view of the restrictions during the pilgrimage season.

Besides the Chief Secretary, Principal Secretaries of Devaswom, Health, Forest; Secretary, Home; and the State Police Chief were in the committee.

The Mandala Puja is on December 26 and Makaravilakku on January 14, 2021.

156,2020/10/06,Help that comes as a saving grace during tough times,"Job portal to help those who lost jobs during the pandemic is proving to a hit

A job portal launched by a group of Technopark employees to help those from the IT sector who have lost jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic is proving to be of much help to them during this period of crisis.

As many as 75 people have now found new jobs through the jobs.prathidhwani.org portal, run by Prathidhwani, a welfare organisation of IT employees across Kerala.

In May, The Hindu had reported the launch of the job portal by the employees. Since the launch, 1,500 job posts have been listed on it by 100 different employers, with 1,200 people registering for jobs, including those who are employed at present and are looking for better options.

On Tuesday, Sasi Pilacheri Meethal, CEO of Technoparks and IT Parks, Kerala, launched an improved version of the portal through a videoconferencing event.

“We give priority to those who have lost their jobs during the pandemic period. While registering, they have an option to mention this. Such profiles will be highlighted. Employers who are searching for candidates can filter to see just the ones whose careers were affected by COVID-19. This will be helpful for those looking for experienced hands and also wants to help out those who have lost their jobs,” says Nishin T.N., a representative of Prathidhwani.

The team running the portal collects statistics on the trending jobs that employers are looking for the most in the portal and plans to conduct training sessions to upskill those who were laid off, with the help of the Prathidhwani technical forum. As part of the weekly technical sessions, training will be imparted on these trending technologies.

Prathidhwani also recently carried out a drive to identify people who have lost their jobs during this period and are in dire need of financial assistance. As part of this, 31 such employees were identified and ₹5,000 each was provided to them, using money pooled from amongst the employees.

Some IT companies in Kerala, including in Technopark and Infopark in Kochi, had laid off employees during the pandemic period, without even the necessary compensation. Although ‘performance issues’ were cited in all cases, those who have got the pink slips say that this is just a reason being made up to cut down numbers and save on employee cost. Many of them have been struggling post the job loss, as they have loans and EMIs pending, as well as rents and school fees to pay.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/help-that-comes-as-a-saving-grace-during-tough-times/article32783789.ece

With the weekend lull affecting COVID-19 detection activities, daily testing dipped to 38,696 samples in the State, yielding 5,042 new cases on Monday. Test positivity rate, while it has dipped from 14.6 to 13 %, is still significantly high.

The number of recoveries reported on Monday was 4,640.

The cumulative case burden of the State climbed to 2,34,928 cases, of which, 84,873 are currently being treated in various hospitals in the State. Of these, 563 patients are critically ill and in ICUs, with another 159 on ventilator support.

Kannur reported the maximum number of infections among health-care workers at 35, Ernakulam 19 and Thiruvananthapuram 18. Of the new cases, in 450 cases, the source of infection remains untraceable.

158,2020/10/06,Ordinance to amend university laws promulgated,"It empowers varsities to consider applications for new generation courses

Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has promulgated the University Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020 empowering the Syndicates of Kerala, Calicut, Mahatma Gandhi, and Kannur universities to consider applications for new courses in affiliated colleges for the academic year 2020-21.

A gazette notification of the Ordinance issued on Monday will expire in one month. “Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act and the Statutes, made thereunder, the Syndicate may receive and consider applications for affiliation of a new course in an affiliated college for the academic year 2020-21 within one month from the date of commencement of the Ordinance,” says the amendments made in the Acts of the four universities.

The Ordinance was promulgated as part of inviting applications from affiliated colleges for the new innovative and interdisciplinary programmes for the academic year 2020-21.

However, the deadline for submitting applications for new courses in 2020-21 had already expired as per the statutes of the universities and the institutions were not in a position to invite applications for new courses. The government wanted to launch the new innovative programmes from November 1 onwards.

The gazette notification says that the Assembly is not in session and the Governor is satisfied that circumstances exist that render it necessary for him to take immediate action.

With the promulgation of the Ordinance, the universities can invite applications for the innovative and interdisciplinary undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in its affiliated colleges. The universities are likely to call for applications for launching nearly 100 to 150 new courses in this academic year.

An order issued by the Department of Higher Education on September 18 says that NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) score and NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) ranking need not be insisted for colleges having necessary infrastructure to start four and five year programmes. The proposals of colleges belonging to Scheduled Caste community trusts can also be recommended, even if unaccredited, it says.

The department had asked the universities to consider the recommendations of the Kerala State Higher Education Council while recommending the new innovative and interdisciplinary programmes.

159,2020/10/06,Royalty scheme fails to enthuse paddy farmers,"Only 48,881 applications, mostly from Palakkad and Alappuzha, received so far

The royalty scheme for owners of cultivable paddy land in the State has seen a tepid response with only a fraction of the owners submitting applications so far.

Earlier, the government had announced ₹2,000 per hectare every year as royalty under the Rice Development scheme. It has set aside ₹40 crore for the project and had started receiving applications from September 11.

As of Monday, the Agriculture Department received around 48,881 applications, far less than anticipated. Of these, 21,236 were received from Palakkad and another 12,049 from Alappuzha – the two major rice-producing districts of Kerala. The department was expecting more than two lakh applications from across the State.

No deadline

Officials with the Agriculture Department said that no deadline had been fixed for submitting the application and they hoped more people would apply to avail themselves of the benefit in the coming days.

“After the initial lukewarm response, the number of applications being submitted is picking up. As beneficiaries need to submit the application online, a large number of them have to go to Akshaya centres. With the COVID-19 spreading thick and fast, many of them are reluctant to go there. As there is no last date to file the application, they can do it at any time, “ said, Sapheena K.S. Deputy Director of Agriculture, Alappuzha.

However, the owners, especially smallholders seem to be less enthusiastic about the scheme. “When it comes to Kuttanad, the majority are small landowners. The royalty is ₹2,000 per hectare. Those who own small fields, for example, one acre, 50 cents or even less are not going to get much. The government should have announced an equal royalty to all irrespective of the area of land they possess,” said, Renil Kumar K.K., secretary, Vavakkad North padasekharam in Kuttanad.

Tax receipts

Mr. Kumar said that several paddy field owners in Kuttanad did not have tax receipts as the fields still remain under the ownership of landlords. Although current owners bought it from landlords several decades ago, titles were yet to be transferred. The applicants should provide tax receipt/possession certificate to get the royalty.

The royalty was announced as an encouragement to owners/ farmers to continue paddy cultivation. According to officials, owners of fields currently under cultivation are eligible for the royalty. Those cultivating pulses, vegetables, sesame and groundnuts in paddy fields as part of the crop cycle can also apply. Owners of fields that remain fallow can file the application after giving assurance that the cultivation will be revived either by them or through other farmers or agencies.

The applications for the royalty should be filed online on www.aims.kerala.gov.in.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pbr51c/article32788371.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7tval2--paddy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/royalty-scheme-fails-to-enthuse-paddy-farmers/article32783699.ece
160,2020/10/06,41 arrested on child pornography charges in Kerala,"Month-long covert operation exposes surge in online trafficking of child sexual abuse material

A month-long covert online surveillance operation, code-named P-Hunt_20.2 has culminated in the arrest of 41 people from across Kerala on the charge of ‘seeking, collecting, browsing and downloading’ child pornography, according to the State police.

The police have also found vast caches of videos and pictures of minors stored on mobile phones, pen drives, hard discs, tablets and laptop computers seized from the suspects.

Manoj Abraham, Additional Director General of Police and head of the Countering Child Sexual Exploitation (CCSE) team, told The Hindu on Monday that the confiscated content included videos and images captured furtively, mostly on mobile phones, in domestic environs during the COVID-19 period in Kerala.

From security cameras

The police found child sexual abuse material (CSAM) content sourced from security cameras at homes and in flats and images and videos of children harvested from webcams.

Another officer said the cases detected was merely the tip of the iceberg. Child abuse could go unreported since children have little contact with their classmates or teachers due to the restrictions on in-person schooling.

Investigators said the stay-at-home circumstances had resulted in increased Internet usage. There was a worrying surge in Internet search engine queries related to child pornography. Investigators at the Kerala Police Cyberdome identified persons who obsessively downloaded, disseminated or traded child CSAM over social media platforms. They used a mix of surveillance software, social engineering techniques and deceptive social media identities to insinuate themselves into the clandestine child porn sharing circles.

‘Specialised’ groups

The darknet was the platform of choice for posting, harvesting and disseminating CSAM. The police also stumbled upon WhatsApp and Instagram groups, with names such as Corona Life and Gold Garden, that specialised in sharing images and videos of children.

State Police Chief Loknath Behera supervised the covert operation code-named P-Hunt_20.2. Inspector General (IG) of Police, Crime Branch, S. Sreejith; IG, South Zone, Harshita Attaluri; and IG, North Zone, Ashok Yadav, coordinated the arrests and seizures.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dmo1gf/article32778914.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tv-Operation-P-Huntcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/41-arrested-on-child-pornography-charges-in-kerala/article32778915.ece
161,2020/10/06,Tunnel road project launched in Kerala,"7-km subterranean road will link Wayanad, Kozhikode

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced the project launch of the proposed Anakkampoyil-Meppadi tunnel road through videoconferencing on Monday. The road connects Wayanad and Kozhikode districts.

Mr. Vijayan said the project, estimated to cost ₹900 crore, would be the third longest such undertaking in the country. It would be completed by complying with environmental regulations.

The Chief Minister said the subterranean road to be constructed by Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. would reduce traffic congestion on the risky Thamarassery Ghat road. “It would also boost the domestic tourism sector and the trade and commerce between Karnataka and the Malabar region.”

On eco concerns

Referring to the environmental concerns raised about the seven-km-long tunnel, Mr. Vijayan said the Left Democratic Front government was in favour of taking a decision which could address the environmental concerns and bolster local development. “We are not ready to succumb to unwanted controversies,” he said.

In three years

Minister for Public Works G. Sudhakaran, who presided over the event online, said the project could be completed in three years. “The State government will sanction any additional amount required for the timely completion of the project,” he said. It was in 2014 that the government did a feasibility study of the proposal to realise an alternative road to Wayanad district. In 2016, it was officially approved for further proceedings and survey works.

Initial estimate

A few months ago, the State government accorded sanction to the preliminary estimate of ₹658 crore for implementation under the Kerala State Infrastructure Investment Fund Board.

Officials who prepared the preliminary estimate said the cost of completing a 1-km stretch of the road, comprising a 70-metre-long bridge at Kundanthodu, would itself come to ₹150 crore.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/odsie5/article32778864.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06TVTHAMARASSERYGHATROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tunnel-road-project-launched-in-kerala/article32778867.ece
162,2020/10/06,"Nearly 20% people in Kerala not protected by face masks, finds study","Global Institute of Public Health found that 96% of people wore masks, but 16% wore them improperly, without covering the nose or mouth

About 20% of 4,500 people surveyed across all districts of the State were not protected by face masks, either because they did not wear a mask or wore it improperly, according to a study by the Global Institute of Public Health, Thiruvananthapuram.

The study found that 96% of people wore masks, but 16% wore them improperly, without covering the nose or mouth. Proper mask use was highest in Malappuram district (85.8%), which was also coincidentally classified as a “high zone” (district with a cumulative caseload of over 8,000 till August 28).

Thiruvanthapuram, also categorised as a high zone, had mask use of 85.5%, while Idukki, categorised as a “low zone” (district with cumulative caseload of less than 4,000) had the lowest mask use at 62.4%. Ernakulam and Kozhikode recorded 82.9% and 79.7% mask use respectively.

Photographs used

The study was conducted between August 28 and September 5. Using the method of photo-epidemiology, over 1,400 photographs were taken in public spaces, hospitals and at indoor gatherings, capturing 6,208 people. Around 4,500 people who were clearly visible in the photographs were used for analysis.

The average number of people per photo frame was used as a measure of physical distancing and the study found that crowding was higher in the high zone districts of Malappuram and Thiruvananthapuram, indicating that inadequate physical distancing could have contributed to a higher number of cases in these districts, despite high mask use.

“Eighty per cent proper mask use is not bad, but it is not enough, since Kerala is densely populated,” said S.S. Lal, head of public health at the Global Institute of Public Health, pointing out that there was no comparison available with other States yet.

Anand Marthanda Pillai, principal investigator of the study, said, “Overall mask usage of 96% is very high. But the 20% of people who did not use masks properly or not at all could be a loophole large enough to be concerning and spread the virus,” he said. Dr. Pillai added that a drawback of the study was that it only looked at mask use in public spaces and not in private settings like at home or at work, where mask use might be lower and the virus could spread.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ohj28j/article32777410.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/maskki06,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nearly-20-people-in-kerala-not-protected-by-face-masks-finds-study/article32777411.ece
163,2020/10/06,Centre told to take loan for GST compensation,"Call to activate Dispute Resolution Mechanism

Kerala led nine other States in rejecting the two options for Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation mooted by the Union government at the 42nd GST Council on Monday.

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac, who represented the State, said Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, Puducherry, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, supported Kerala’s stance and was of the view that the Centre should take loan for the payment of the GST compensation. Dr. Isaac said 20 States favoured the first option mooted by the Centre at the last GST council. The first option is to provide a special borrowing window to States in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India to provide ₹97,000 crore at a reasonable interest rate. The other option is to meet the entire GST compensation gap of ₹2.35 lakh crore this year itself after consulting the Central Bank.

In Monday’s deliberations, 10 States rejected the proposals mooted by the Centre to extend the compensation cess beyond 2022.

The Finance Minister said the Centre and the States that supported the options of the Centre were not ready for discussions on who would borrow in what proportion, what amount would be borrowed, and what amount would be deferred. Instead, as in the last GST Council, after extending the meeting to 6.30 p.m., it was announced that the States that opposed the Centre’s suggestions should intimate their stance once more, Dr. Isaac said.

‘Decide through vote’

“Kerala opposed it and said it was not the GST Council’s decision. The Centre is a member of the GST Council and hence decisions should be taken through voting. The legal provisions for Dispute Resolution Mechanism should be activated. Nine States supported us. Without going for a vote after eight hours of deliberations, it was announced that the GST Council will take a call on the compensation at the next meeting on October 12,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/centre-told-to-take-loan-for-gst-compensation/article32777220.ece

167,2020/10/06,‘The Boys in the Band’ review: A sensitive take on a landmark event in gay theatre,"Adapted from Matt Crowley’s 1968 play, the Netflix drama tells the story of a group of gay friends during a birthday party, with an all-star cast including Jim Parsons and Zachary Quinto

When Mart Crowley’s landmark play, The Boys in the Band, premiered off Broadway in 1968, it was in an era marked by the damaging effects of McCarthyism and the subsequent persecution of the LGBT community. The Stonewall uprising, which marked the beginning of the queer liberation movement, was still one year away.

As Crowley mentions in a feature on Netflix, even the actors in the play were discouraged by their agents from being a part of it at the time.

Following the precedent of adapting the play to film featuring the same actors, the 2020 Ryan Murphy-produced film also features the same cast and director as the 2018 Tony winning revival production. Perhaps in the most positive marker of how much things have changed from 1968, the roles in the 2020 film are played by out gay men.

So, what is The Boys in the Band about? (The title, incidentally is taken from the Judy Garland-starrer A Star is Born).

Michael (Jim Parsons) is set to host a birthday party for Harold (Zachary Quinto), Michael’s equal in acerbity, who doesn’t hesitate to call him out. On the guest list are Donald (Matt Bomer), whose analyst has cancelled his appointment; Emory (Robin de Jesús), the most flamboyant one in the group; Bernard (Michael Benjamin Washington), the only black man; Hank (Tuc Watkins), who has left his wife and children, and Larry (Andrew Rannells) who are in a relationship but have differing views on commitment and monogamy. One unexpected addition is Cowboy (Charlie Carver), a pretty but dumb escort (as everyone makes sure to let him know) Emory hires for Harold.

While the party begins in good spirits (it’s a lot of banter), Michael is worried as he was forced to invite his distraught college roommate, Alan McCarthy, to the party. The addition of this particular unexpected guest serves as the catalyst for what is to follow as Michael asks the group to essentially cool it, as Alan is straight and doesn’t know that Michael is gay.

The Boys in the Band Cast: Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto, Matt Bomer, Andrew Rannells, Tuc Watkins, Michael Benjamin Washington, Brian Hutchison, Robin de Jesús, Charlie Carver

Director: Joe Mantello

Runtime: 2 hours

Storyline: A group of gay friends gather for a birthday party in 1968 in New York. As the night wears on, feelings and bitter truths emerge

Naturally, things don’t go as expected: insults are hurled, offensive language is used, and a fight breaks out. In addition, Michael, who has been drinking and smoking (earlier, he tells Donald that he stopped because he can’t take the ‘icks’ anymore and acknowledges that he gets hostile when high), proposes a game: each person has to call up someone they love and tell them that they love them.

Things get increasingly out of hand and bitter truths emerge as Michael, pressures his friends to make the calls, including Alan who he tries to goad into coming out. Alan, on the other hand, keeps looking to Hank for help, who, in appearing ‘straight’, is the person he is most comfortable with.

While all the actors are very good, particularly Jim Parsons, it is also in the moments of vulnerability when making the call that de Jesús, Rannells, and Washington shine.

The film deals with themes and subjects such as coming out, internalised homophobia, religion, commitment, friendship, relationships, the sense of community, and the idea of beauty.

While The Boys in the Band probably works better as a play, a film makes the story accessible to a far wider audience. In addition, the film serves as a good marker of how things were, how much has changed, and how much more needs to change. And for that reason, is definitely worth a watch.

168,2020/10/06,A step in a new direction for Vijay Yesudas,"After 20 years in films, Vijay Yesudas says he is in the cusp of new things, including a New York-style salon for men, Chop Shop, in Kochi

As a playback singer, Vijay Yesudas completes two decades in films this year. The son of legendary singer, KJ Yesudas, Vijay says it is a ‘weird feeling’.

The years were spent pushing himself to learn and sing as if each song were his first, says Vijay, over phone from his Chennai home. The singer’s debut was in the 2000 Malayalam film Millenium Stars. “I have never competed with colleagues. I have only made friends, supported them and loved their music,” he says, looking back on the journey so far.

The singer adds that he is also in the cusp of new things, partially influenced by the outbreak of COVID-19. He is turning entrepreneur with the launch of a New York-style salon for men , Chop Shop, in Kochi. With business partners, he is the franchisee for Chop Shop in four South Indian States. He also recently launched his YouTube channel, The V Company by VJY, which he intends to use for his musical pursuits.

“During the pandemic, we realised that a musician is at the sad end of the food chain. This is a financially difficult time for everybody, and it is not easy for us with shows being cancelled.”

Diversification of his portfolio had been on his mind for sometime, and these initiatives are a part of the plan to create a space for himself outside the film industry. Simultaneously, he has also been thinking of the direction he should take in terms of music: launching his YouTube channel is that step in a new direction. Vijay uploaded his first song a month ago, ‘Malayalam - Onam 2020’, penned by Rajaneesh R Chandran. Vijay had scored the music for the song.

With nepotism being the catchword of recent social media debates, one would assume that being the son of a legend would have made things easy for him, but Vijay denies that it was the case. “My songs were clicking in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada, but in Malayalam it took time. It was 2007 when I got a ‘Kolakkuzhal Villi Ketto’. That is when things started turning and people began to trust me,” he says.

That song in the film Nivedyam got him his first Kerala State Award for Best Singer. It was the first in a series of awards; two more Kerala State Awards came soon after.

Vijay’s career took a detour in 2015 when he turned actor in the Dhanush film Maari where he played the antagonist. This was followed by another Tamil film Padaiveeran in 2018.

When lockdown was announced he was filming the multilingual Salmon 3D. Vijay says he has been listening to scripts during the break. “Honestly, I would have jumped into acting sooner, but my father told me to focus on one thing — music. Starting young, as actor, has an impact. I started 10 to15 years late, but now the concept of a film’s hero has also changed. I don’t regret it though, I was able to focus on music.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/69s93z/article32783367.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpvijayyesudas,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vijay-yesudas-is-in-the-cusp-of-new-things-as-he-completes-20-years-in-the-industry/article32783368.ece
169,2020/10/06,Watch | This Malayalam short film on coronavirus is shot at a real-life Covid-19 treatment centre,"Directed by Sajeev Khan AR, 10th Day is based on his family’s experience recovering from the disease at a first-line treatment centre

Last month, short filmmaker Sajeev Khan AR and family tested positive for Covid-19. ""Out of 18 members in our extended family, 17 had the virus,"" he says. Needing assistance, all of them opted to see out the phase at a Covid-19 First-Line Treatment centre set up at a government school near their place at Kadinamkulam in Thiruvananthapuram. His short film 10th Day, shot at the treatment centre and featuring real-life people in quarantine, is based on Sajeev's experience there.

""All of those involved — both behind and before the camera — were Covid positive at the time of shooting. We had the go-ahead from medical officers for the short film. The idea was to see through the perspective of a Covid patient,"" he says. Through the story of a mother-son duo, 10th Day highlights the importance of caring for others, especially during a crisis.

Sajeev says he was quite concerned about health initially when he entered the treatment centre and thought about a film later. ""Once we all got used to the situation, I worked on the storyboard. I had my camera sent through a cousin of mine. The equipment was sanitised with the help of health volunteers. The film was shot in two days and I started the editing at the centre itself. Thankfully, I was healthy enough to work,"" he adds. His brother Sameer Khan plays the protagonist in the short, while the cinematography was by another sibling, Safer Khan.

Sajeev says it was challenging to convince others recuperating at the centre to play their part. ""Most of them never faced a camera before and were a bit apprehensive initially. However, gradually, a camaraderie developed among us as all of us were essentially staying together. It felt like a community,"" he says, adding that all members of his family have recovered since.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/gkpez6/article32782438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03tvmstillshortfilm,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/this-malayalam-short-film-on-coronavirus-is-shot-at-a-real-life-covid-19-treatment-centre/article32782439.ece
170,2020/10/06,"‘Emily in Paris’ review: A charming fantasy of a show, featuring a knock-out Lily Collins","‘Sex and the City’ creator Darren Star presents a breezy rom-com universe on Netflix, that is an absolute treat for millennials

It’s probably all the pandemic-induced house arrest; you’re sure to find yourself wanting to hop on a plane with every beautiful frame of the French capital while watching Emily in Paris.

The web series, which dropped on Netflix last week has 10 episodes and lends itself perfectly to a session of binge-watching, boasting of stunning visuals, big fashion moments, charming French men and a lot of chatter about food and wine.

We dive straight into Emily Cooper’s (Lily Collins) shift from Chicago to Paris. She can’t imagine living anywhere other than Chicago and yet, due to a sudden turn of events, she finds herself on a plane to Paris. Cooper is there to give Savoir, a Parisian marketing company that they’re merging with some American perspective on marketing. This is something that her French colleagues, led by the head Sylvie (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu) aren’t particularly welcoming of, and are also in equal parts bemused by the fact that she can’t speak French.

The show packs in as many stereotypes as possible, staying true to its rom-com genre. We have the cold boss, the hot neighbour, the funny co-workers, the genius yet moody fashion designer and the supportive friends. Yet, what makes Emily in Paris tick is how it doesn’t ever take itself too seriously.

Emily in Paris Creator: Darren Star

Starring: Lily Collins, Philippine Leroy-Beaulie, Ashley Park

No. of episodes: 10

Storyline: After landing her dream job in Paris, Chicago marketing exec Emily Cooper embraces her adventurous new life while juggling work, friends and romance

We see Emily navigate work as her mid-western sensibilities clash with the Parisian work culture and ethic: all while posting (sometimes cringeworthy) updates on her social media accounts and slowly building a following. “Americans live to work, we work to live.” a colleague tells her sagely. True to the times it is set in, the series has a lot to say about influencer marketing, Instagrammable spots and what it means to be politically correct.

The show’s creator Darren Star (Sex and the City, Younger) keeps the tone light, effervescent and optimistic. You know Emily is going to emerge unscathed from every curve-ball that’s thrown at her in each episode, and yet it’s hard to stop watching. This predictability does not take away from the show’s light-hearted appeal.

The series is also hell-bent on ensuring that we’re all on the same page when it comes to agreeing that Paris truly is the city of romance. Emily is relentlessly pursued by every man she meets, though these romantic encounters range from swoon-worthy to downright appalling.

Collins brings Emily alive on screen with her enthusiasm and earnestness. Hers is a character that could have become unlikable if not played by the right actor and she largely succeeds in giving you a protagonist that you end up rooting for (and yet want to stage the occasional intervention for). Leroy-Beaulieu plays a tough boss to the hilt, and while it sure is entertaining to see her roll her eyes at Emily’s marketing ideas and spar with her, you are left wanting more.

Lucas Bravo who plays Gabriel, her dreamy next-door neighbour, also plays a huge part in her tangled romantic life and lights up the screen in every frame he’s in. One wishes, however, that the writers had spent a little more time on Emily’s friend Mindy Chen (Broadway star Ashely Park) and her storyline. There’s a lot that could have been fleshed out with her story; but within the limitations of her character, Park manages to infuse warmth to her on screen persona.

While the show doesn’t quite pack the punch that Star’s earlier work Sex and the City did, watch Emily in Paris for its breezy charm and appeal. There’s a lot of wine, croissants, chic couture and dreamy Paris moments to be enjoyed.

Streaming platform Netflix will not go ahead with the fourth and final season of female wrestling dramedy GLOW, due to production delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

GLOW, starring Alison Brie, Betty Gilpin and Marc Maron, was renewed for its final season last year and had started production in February.

It finished one episode and started filming on the second before the coronavirus pandemic led to production shutdown in mid-March.

“We’ve made the difficult decision not to do a fourth season of ‘GLOW’ due to COVID, which makes shooting this physically intimate show with its large ensemble cast especially challenging. We are so grateful to creators Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch, Jenji Kohan and all the writers, cast and crew for sharing this story about the incredible women of GLOW with us and the world,” a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement to Deadline.

GLOW also featured Sydelle Noel, Kate Nash, Britney Young, Gayle Rankin, Kia Stevens, Sunita Mani, Jackie Tohn, Kimmy Gatewood, Britt Baron, Rebekka Johnson, Ellen Wong, Chris Lowell, Marianna Palka, Shakira Barrera, and Bashir Salahuddin.

The series was inspired by the short-lived 1980s wrestling TV show of the same name, which stood for Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.

174,2020/10/06,Bigg Boss 14: Nikki Tamboli wants to work with Vijay Sethupathi after reality show,"The ‘Kanchana 3’ star is currently a contestant on the Hindi show hosted by Salman Khan

It’s been barely three days, and Nikki Tamboli has already emerged as one of the most exciting contestants on the Salman Khan-hosted reality show, Bigg Boss 14.

One of the few south actors to make it to the Hindi version of the contest, Nikki is popular in the Telugu and Tamil film industries —but the Aurangabad native now wants to captivate audiences up north and has Bollywood on her mind.

The model-turned-actor made her debut in the 2019 Telugu horror-comedy Chikati Gadilo Chithakotudu, directed by Santhosh P. Jayakumar, which was a remake of the Tamil hit Iruttu Araiyil Murattu Kuththu. Nikki then went on to make her Tamil debut in the same genre with the blockbuster Kanchana 3 alongside Lawrence. She also starred in the Telugu thriller Thippara Meesam.

Speaking to us just before entering the Bigg Boss 14 house, Nikki says that when the opportunity to be part of the show came her way, she just couldn’t pass up on it. “It was a great chance to show viewers who I really am. I’m a really bubbly, talkative person who loves to make fun of others and keep everyone laughing. I want the audiences to keep looking out for “that attractive girl” who takes on all the tasks and keeps entertaining them,” she says.

The model-turned-actor made her debut in the 2019 Telugu horror-comedy ‘Chikati Gadilo Chithakotudu’

But considering she’s more well-known in south India, didn’t she want to go on the Telugu or Tamil Bigg Boss shows? “I’ve never really planned anything in my career, and just taken the chances as they came my way. I like to think of myself as destiny’s child! I’m sure people down south also check out the Hindi version.”

Nikki is most excited about interacting with host Salman Khan on a weekly basis, confessing that she’s a massive fan of the Bollywood superstar: “I haven’t been able to sleep before entering the house; I’m that thrilled to share the same stage as him. It’s an absolute dream come true.”

Adding that she has no regrets about missing out on films for the three months when she’s inside the Bigg Boss house, Nikki also says that she feels perfectly safe on the show during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, “Every safety measure has been taken, and I know I’m in good hands. The important thing for an actor or performer is to get constant visibility; now with films being stalled, this is the perfect opportunity for us to impress audiences every day. After the show, I will make my Bollywood debut, and down south, I really hope I get a chance to work with Vijay Sethupathi sir.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pqvilk/article32780569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/nikki4,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bigg-boss-14-nikki-tamboli-wants-to-work-with-vijay-sethupathi-after-reality-show/article32780570.ece

Actor Tamannaah Bhatia on Monday said she was being discharged from a Hyderabad hospital after testing positive for coronavirus and will now self quarantine.

The “Baahubali” star was shooting for a project when she developed mild fever and eventually underwent a COVID-19 test last week.

In a statement, Bhatia, 30, said she feels “relatively well” now.

“Although my team and I have been very disciplined on set, I unfortunately succumbed to a mild fever last week. After undertaking the mandatory tests, I was diagnosed as COVID-19 positive.”

“I admitted myself into a private hospital in Hyderabad to mitigate adverse health outcomes and after being under the care of expert medical professionals I am now being discharged,” the actor said.

Bhatia said it has been a “strenuous week” but she is optimistic she would “recover fully from this health peril which is distressing so many people around the world“.

“For the present, I will be self isolating as advised. A big virtual hug to everyone for their love, concern and positivity. Stay safe, stay healthy, stay well,” she further said in the statement.

In August, Bhatia’s parents had tested positive for COVID-19.

Warner Bros said late Monday it is delaying the release of “Dune” and “The Batman” movies, another setback for the entertainment industry hit by COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and social distancing measures that have closed theaters worldwide.

“Dune”, a sci-fi movie directed by Canadian director Dennis Villeneuve, is now scheduled to open in October 2021, instead of December. The release of “The Batman”, starring Robert Pattinson, has been moved to the spring of 2022 from October next year.

Movie releases have been getting delayed even after restrictions were eased, with people still wary of stepping into cinema halls, and many theaters still not operational.

On Monday, the world’s second-biggest cinema chain, Cineworld, decided to temporarily close its UK and U.S. movie theaters in an attempt to survive a collapse in film-making and cinema-going.

Credit rating agency Fitch promptly downgraded the company.

“Our base-case forecasts indicate that, the company’s current liquidity levels may only be sufficient until November to December 2020, assuming no revolving credit facility (RCF) extensions,” Fitch said in a statement.

Earlier, the filming of “The Batman” was also shut down for two weeks after a member of the production - widely reported to be Pattinson - tested positive for the new coronavirus. Filming resumed in Britain last month and Warner Bros never confirmed or denied reports about Pattinson’s diagnosis.

“Dune” has gained a lot of traction for its cast that includes 24-year-old Timothee Chalamet, who was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in the 2017 film “Call Me by Your Name.”

Other big-budget Warner Bros movies to have their releases delayed include “Tenet” and “Wonder Woman 1984”.

The release of the new James Bond movie “No Time to Die” from MGM and Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures has also been delayed until April 2021.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ch9f8e/article32780409.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/dune-first-tv-spot-1237619-1280x0,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/warner-bros-delays-dune-the-batman-movies/article32780410.ece

179,2020/10/06,HC seeks reports on archaeological excavations,"Court asks ASI whether an Epigraphy Branch can be set up in T.N.

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday asked the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) when the reports of the excavations carried out in Tamil Nadu would be ready. So far, only the report on Gudiyam caves was ready and preparation of the report on Adichanallur was under way after the court’s direction, it observed.

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi was hearing a batch of public interest litigation petitions that sought a direction to the ASI and the Tamil Nadu State Department of Archaeology to carry out scientific research in various historical places across the State.

Taking cognisance of the submission that as of now the ASI was not excavating any site in Tamil Nadu, the court asked the Centre about its plans for the State and directed a report be submitted in this regard as more and more Tamil inscriptions were being unearthed across the country.

Further, the court asked the ASI to respond on the possibility of establishing an Epigraphy Branch of the ASI in Tamil Nadu similar to the one in Mysuru, Karnataka. The court sought to know the steps taken to digitise the inscriptions and directed the report to be submitted on October 15.

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi observed that even biomedical waste from neighbouring States was being dumped in Tamil Nadu and officials were not keeping vigil. Action needed to be taken against those involved in such activities and the officials concerned.

The court directed the State to respond to a series of queries: ‘was biomedical waste treated in the prescribed manner?, whether waste from neighbouring States was being dumped here?, did officials detect violations? and what action was taken?’

The court observed that many were taking advantage of COVID-19 lockdown and indulged in such activities. The court was hearing the public interest litigation petition filed by S. Manivel from Manapparai in Tiruchi district, who complained that biomedical waste was being dumped into Karadukulam Kanmai at Vaiyampatti.

The party is demanding seven SC sub-sects – Kudumban, Pannadi, Kadaiyan, Pallan, Kaladi, Vathiriyan and Devendrakulathan – be declared Devendrakula Vellalar instead of being identified by their sub-sects. The party also demands removal of Devendrakula Vellalar from the list of Scheduled Castes.

Though party chief K. Krishnasamy made these demands to the PT’s electoral allies – ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu and the BJP at the Centre – no formal notification has been issued in this connection by the State government.

Irked over this, the PT refused to support the AIADMK candidate in the Nanguneri by-election held last year and boycotted the election.

Later, the PT decided to organise State-wide hunger strike to press for the demand. In the fast organised at Oorudaiyankudiyiruppu here, PT’s election wing secretary Natarajan participated.

Minister for School Education K.A. Sengottaiyan on Tuesday said that the health and safety of the students were the government’s top priority in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and no decision has been made yet on the reopening of schools.

“The safety of the students is what we are focussed on right now and the Chief Minister will decide when schools will reopen after discussions with the Education, Health and other departments,” he said.

This comes a day after the Union Education Ministry released standard operating procedures for the reopening of schools after October 15 in a phased manner.

On Tuesday, the Minister chaired a meeting at the Anna Centenary Library in Kotturpuram of Chief Educational Officials (CEOs) and other directors from the School Education Department. “Learning has been going on through online classes as well as televised lessons, and this meeting was convened to assess the current situation regarding the same,” Mr. Sengottaiyan said.

While the School Education Department in September had said that students of classes 10 to 12 could be called in to schools voluntarily to seek guidance in batches, the decision was soon put on hold.

The detailed guidelines released by the Education Ministry on Monday say that States should take the consent of parents or guardians before their child begins attending school and that students who are willing to study from home can continue to do so.

DMK president M.K. Stalin wrote to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Tuesday urging him to immediately convene a special session of the Tamil Nadu Assembly, pass resolutions against the Farm Acts and also move the Supreme Court challenging the legality of the legislations.

“States have complete authority to frame laws on agriculture which is in the State List as per the Indian Constitution. Also, issues of land and land tenure are in the State List. If one reads provisions 46, 47, 48 together under the State List, only States have the right to frame laws on agriculture. Hence, we cannot be silent when the Centre infringes on the State’s rights. This is unacceptable,” Mr. Stalin said.

The DMK had filed cases against the three legislations in the Supreme Court on the basis of the federal rights given by the Constitution, Mr. Stalin said. He said only States can get to know the needs of farmers, fulfil them and protect them. It has been the State government that has, over the ages, saved farmers from middlemen and ensured that they get a fair price for their produce, he said.

Jai Murhekar, who ranked 49th in the Common Merit List of the Joint Engineering Examination (Advanced) and is the State topper in the exam, the results of which were released on Monday, wants to pursue CSE or Electrical Engineering in either the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras or in IIT-Bombay.

A resident of the city for the past 14 years, he said, “I took a lot of mock tests. I have been preparing for around four years.”

His father is with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and his mother is an oncologist at the Cancer Institute.

Ashwin Ramachandran, ranked 56 in the CRL, prefers CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) at IIT-B. His mother is a schoolteacher and his father an electrical engineer.

His inspiration is his uncle, who was ranked 49th in the JEE merit list in 1993 and now owns a start up in California. He said he referred to books that his faculty recommended.

He familiarised himself with problems from the books which helped him prepare better. “In that way, I was able to attend most of the questions,” he said.

C. Aditya, ranked 75th, began preparing four years ago. He took the mock exams regularly. His father is an IT software professional and his mother a homemaker.

Although the integrated programme and the preparation for Class 12 was hectic initially, “as the course went on, it became fun,” he said.

‘Sound grounding’

For A. Balakrishnan, too, it is CSE at IIT-Madras. He believes that a sound grounding in the basics is important before launching into specialisations.

His parents are both chemical engineers. Kruthic Vignesh M., ranked 126, also wants to take up CSE at IIT-Madras. His father is a professor in a polytechnic college. It was maintaining a regular habit of studying that helped him ace the exam, he says.

All these students took up the integrated coaching offered by FIIT JEE.

Sooraj Srinivasan, who is ranked 158, would also like to pursue CSE at IIT-Madras. A student of Aakash’s Classroom programme, he began preparing from Class 9.

190,2020/10/06,Scripture Union suspends preacher,"He is accused of sending inappropriate messages to children

Following allegations that surfaced on social media about a preacher who sent inappropriate messages, including those of a sexual nature, to school girls, Scripture Union has suspended him and initiated an investigation into him and three other staff members.

In a thread, Twitter user Joel Giftson alleged that Samuel Jaisunder, who was in charge of Scripture Union’s English publications, had been visiting schools and then sending inappropriate messages to the girls he met there.

A 17-year-old student from a school in Vellore said he had been coming to her school for “SU Week” every year, since she was in kindergarten. The Scripture Union team would hold a morning assembly for all students and then hold classes with different age groups. They would also be available for counselling sessions held one-on-one, she said. She described how he coaxed her into sharing her phone number with him and alleged that during a counselling session, he made her feel uncomfortable by hugging her.

On WhatsApp, Mr. Jaisunder repeatedly asked her for pictures of herself.

Wide network

It was only over the last month or so, after a complaint brought the issue under discussion among students and alumni of her school, that she realised how wide his net had been cast. “There are at least 25-30 students from eight schools in different States who have now come forward,” she says. “I thought it was just me.” In other complaints, received from across the State, the offences date back several years.

Jaisunder and the staff from Scripture Union regularly visited schools across the State to conduct programmes for students. Screenshots shared on Twitter, of alleged conversations he had with students of the schools he used to visit, showed him commenting on their clothes and persistently asking for their photos.

Another woman, who studied in a private school in Chennai, also alleged that he had begun to send her lewd messages after he visited their school for a yearly retreat when she was in Class 9. She recalled how he had constantly broached a conversation about sexual abuse with her, despite she making it clear that she felt uncomfortable.

Internal inquiry

Scripture Union has suspended Mr. Jaisunder with effect from Monday, following a Sunday meeting of the board, and is conducting an internal inquiry against him. Three other staff members named in the allegations, including one woman who has been accused of ignoring complaints from students, are under investigation, according to an official statement.

However, Scripture Union national director J. Joshua Kirubaraj admitted that he had received an oral complaint earlier.

“I knew about this only the day before yesterday. But having said that, two months ago, there was a complaint which was not written, it was over the phone. So I spoke with the parents and the girl, and we had to reprimand Sam. And because it was all oral, I reprimanded Sam orally, that he will not be involved with children for the next two years,” he told The Hindu. “Suddenly, in a spurt, all these things started coming from the day before yesterday. Because we couldn’t control all these things, yesterday, we called the board meeting and we took a decision that Sam has to be immediately suspended.” He said that no other complaint had come to his desk.

Mr. Kirubaraj added that the organisation is working on a child protection policy which all Scripture Union staff and volunteers will have to sign. It will include norms to prevent counselling of girls by male staff. “We are also very clearly stating that we will stand with the child,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/scripture-union-suspends-preacher/article32777296.ece

Heeding to the long-time demand of residents of the remote Erumaivettipalayam in Tiruvallur district, the Highways Department will soon commence work to re-lay the 7.3 km-long road that connects the village to the Karanodai junction on the Kolkata Highway.

The 5,000-odd residents of new and old Erumaivettipalayam villages have to take this road that runs through a reserve forest area for 2 km to reach the main road to get to schools and hospitals. This road is the link since they have Kosasthalaiyar river on the other side with no bridge to cross over.

“That stretch of road inside the forest is nothing but a mud pathway and our vehicles get stuck in the slush during the rain. There are no lights either, and our children have to go to higher secondary school and college only by that way. There are snakes and other animals, making it even more dangerous to ride at night. We have no other access,” said G. Anburaj, a resident.

Sarathy, a priest at the local Kothandaramar temple, said that access to the neighbouring villages of Pudhukuppam, Ayilacheri and Poochettipedu was also only through mud roads.

“Not even two-wheelers can take those routes. When someone falls sick, the nearest PHC is at Padianallur, which is 14 km away and we have to travel through the forest,” he said.

Residents have been clamouring for a proper road for over 10 years now. “It is a necessary connectivity for residents in the area and the work will be carried out at a cost of ₹3.5 crore,” said a Highways official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/numzgt/article32777268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th07road,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/work-on-re-laying-erumaivettipalayam-road-will-commence-soon/article32777269.ece
193,2020/10/06,PT’s demand for exclusion from SC list may need a reality check,"Krishnasamy has called for a hunger strike today

Puthiya Tamilagam founder Dr. K. Krishnasamy has called for a one-day hunger strike on October 6 to push for change in names of 7 communities — Pallar, Kudumbar, Pannadi, Kaalaadi, Kadayar, Devendrakulatar and Vadhiriyaar — and their removal from the list of the Scheduled Castes.

Several organisations, including Devendrar Samooga Padhukappu Koottamaippu and Bahujan Dravida Katchi, said they would oppose these demands as it would hurt the interests of the community. Dr. Krishnasamy has announced a protest in over 10,000 places across Tamil Nadu to urge the State and Central governments to act positively on the demands.

‘Not an election issue’

“We are not taking this up for the elections but for a generation. Whether it becomes an election issue, we will know in time. But nobody can bypass or ignore this demand. In fact, I think leaving the SC list is [similar] to how Dr. Ambedkar embraced Buddhism… we want to leave the SC list. When BC communities are able to avail reservations and claim their identity, why not us,” said Dr. Krishnasamy in a chat with The Hindu.

Almost all mainstream political parties in Tamil Nadu have supported the ‘change in name’, he claimed. These demands, however, have been met with stiff resistance and criticism by members of the communities. Many who oppose these demands said the organisations were influenced by Hindu right wing groups and they have little support, both in terms of historical evidence or among the people.

Arguing that the community would lose the required number of MPs and MLAs and a chance to become panchayat presidents and ward councillors, M. Oorkavalan, co-ordinator, Devendrar Samudhaya Padhugappu Koottamaippu, said, “The name Devendrakula Vellalar has been around for a long time and we do not oppose a change in name. However, removing the community from the SC list, though it has a long way to go in achieving education and financial advancement compared to other non-SC communities, will result in an enormous setback and we will stand to lose the right to reservations and a number of scholarships and financial assistance provided by the government. We will not be able to compete with non-SC communities as a result.”

Writer and publisher of Dalit Murasu Punitha Pandian dismissed the demands as impractical and against the people and the Constitution. “If people simply tear their caste certificates, they have left the SC list. First, he should come forward and tear up his caste certificate as a symbolic gesture before campaigning that the really poor people in his community should give up their Constitutional rights,” said Mr. Pandian.

Many like retired IAS officer Christudas Gandhi, who are involved in societal matters, feel that continuing in the SC list will be beneficial for the Pallar community in the future. “The Pallars have gained Constitutional rights [by being in the SC list]. Only after coming into the list, the Pallars and other Scheduled Castes have grown multifold in Tamil Nadu in all fields. Therefore, I do not see a reason why the community needs to be excluded from the list. The people who are crying quits have also not come forth with any schemes or plans - social and economic - for the community,” he said.

Mannar Maharajan, State President, Bahujan Dravida Katchi, said these demands did not have the support from the community. “Nobody has taken it seriously so far. But, we will show black flags in places where the one-day a hunger protest will be held,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/72dvt0/article26742208.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THKRISHNASWAMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pts-demand-for-exclusion-from-sc-list-may-need-a-reality-check/article32777265.ece

198,2020/10/06,I-T Dept. opposes Karti Chidambaram’s plea,"Case pertains to alleged evasion of capital gains tax

The Income Tax Department has opposed a plea by Sivaganga Member of Parliament Karti P. Chidambaram and his wife Srinidhi Karti Chidambaram to discharge them from prosecution initiated in 2018 for having allegedly evaded capital gains tax in the assessment year 2014-15.

Justice N. Sathish Kumar on Monday decided to commence, in the first week of November, the hearing of arguments on criminal revision petitions filed by the couple against a special court’s refusal to discharge them from the case on the ground that there were materials for trial.

Though the pleadings on the revision petitions had been completed with the I-T Department having filed its counter affidavits through Special Public Prosecutors M. Sheela and N. Baskaran, the petitioners sought time for the appearance of senior counsel Kapil Sibal and P.S. Raman.

In its counter, the Department stated that the couple had made the plea for discharge at a time when the special court for hearing cases against legislators was about to frame charges against them on the basis of the complaint lodged for violation of the Income Tax Act of 1961. It stated that the special court had rightly dismissed the discharge petitions after finding that the Department had made out a prima facie case against the couple for having suppressed the actual sale consideration of their property in Muttukadu and not disclosing the cash part of it.

The Department also told the court that the alleged offence came to light following a hard disk recovered by the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) in a joint search operation conducted by it along with the I-T Department in December 2015 on premises connected to the petitioners. The ED had handed over cloned copies of the hard disk to the Income Tax Investigation wing by following due process of law and a perusal of the hard disk revealed that there were indications of the actual sale amount of the Muttukadu property having been concealed.

In 2018, searches conducted on the premises of Agni Estate and Foundations Private Limited, purchasers of the Muttukadu property, led to the discovery of corroborative materials and hence the Department had chosen to launch criminal prosecution after examination of six witnesses. The Department also claimed that there was no limitation for criminal prosecution in the light of the provisions of the Economic Offences Act of 1974. It further stated the genuineness of the contents of the hard disk could be decided only during the course of trial and not before that.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cqs6d4/article31566475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THKARTHICHIDAMBARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/i-t-dept-opposes-karti-chidambarams-plea/article32777214.ece
199,2020/10/06,"Advisory to close slaughterhouses was issued hastily, animal board tells HC","The Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) on Monday told the Madras High Court that it had issued an advisory “hastily” to the Chief Secretaries of all the States and Union Territories on August 23, 2019, asking them to close down slaughterhouses during the Jain festival of Paryushan Parva.

It told a Division Bench of Justices Vineet Kothari and M.S. Ramesh that following the 2019 circular, one of the members of the AWBI, Girish B. Shah, made a request through WhatsApp for issuing a similar circular this year too. He cited a judgment passed by the Supreme Court on March 14, 2008, to back his plea for closing slaughterhouses. Pursuant to his request, a note was put up before AWBI secretary Sujit Kumar Dutta by attaching the 2019 circular issued by his predecessor. He ordered issuance of a similar circular to the Chief Secretaries of all the States and Union Territories on August 6 this year too, Additional-Solicitor General R. Sankaranarayanan told the court.

However, after the issuance of the circular this year, the AWBI secretary was bombarded with representations from organisations to order the closure of slaughterhouses for a period of 18 days since the Shwetambar sect in the Jain community celebrates Paryushan Parva for the first eight days and the Digambar sect for the next 10 days. It was only after being confronted with multiple representations that the AWBI secretary examined the 2008 Supreme Court judgment and found that it applied to the Municipal Corporation of Ahmedabad and not to the whole country. “It became clear beyond any reason of doubt that in 2019, the AWBI was deliberately misguided and persuaded to issue such an advisory, after a gap of almost 11 years of the Supreme Court judgment, by a specific sect of people,” the AWBI’s counter affidavit read. The AWBI wrote to the Chief Secretaries again on August 11 this year, informing them about the withdrawal of the August 6 circular.

The counter was filed in response to a writ petition filed by the Madurai North Indian Welfare Association for closing slaughter shops in Tamil Nadu during Paryushan Parva. The Bench led by Justice Kothari had called for an explanation from the AWBI. After perusing the counter on Monday, the judge felt such circulars appeared to have been issued even before 2019. He directed the board to submit all original files related to the issue by October 15.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/advisory-to-close-slaughterhouses-was-issued-hastily-animal-board-tells-hc/article32777211.ece
200,2020/10/06,GST compensation dues: T.N. chooses option 1,"But the State hopes it will be reworked to reflect a higher proportion of actual loss in revenue

The Tamil Nadu government on Monday chose option 1 of the two choices laid out by the Centre for the States to borrow money in lieu of the GST compensation dues, in the hope that the Centre would rework it to reflect a higher proportion of the actual loss in revenue of States.

The AIADMK government exercised the first option at the 42nd meeting of the GST Council held through video-conference. In August, the Centre offered two options to the States because it could not give the GST compensation on account of inadequate cess collections. But the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister had earlier rejected both options and insisted that the Centre borrow money and compensate the States, a stand that was not accepted by the Centre.

“Option 2 has been worked out to be completely unattractive and unacceptable to almost all States. In such circumstances and given the very limited options available, Tamil Nadu chooses Option 1 in the hope that it will be reworked to reflect a higher proportion of the actual loss in revenue of States,” Minister D. Jayakumar, deputed to handle GST issues, said at the meeting.

Since the State governments had pointed out at the last meeting chaired by the Union Finance Secretary that the assumption of 10% normal growth in Option 1 was “highly unrealistic and unwarranted”, Mr. Jayakumar said: “Hence, instead, revenue gap of States must be assessed based on an appropriate proportion of the total anticipated loss this financial year under Option 1.”

Even for the current fiscal, the partial release of compensation might be a compulsion but this should not be justified based on the presumptive loss solely on account of the introduction of the GST. “It is a fait accompli that given the fiscal situation, the States have to remain content with receiving only a portion of the compensation,” he said.

Under Option 1, an artificial distinction was being drawn between the GST implementation-based losses and the COVID-19-induced losses, in an effort to limit the total amount of borrowings in 2020-21. “Any attempt to carve out losses solely on account of the GST vitiates the delicately balanced pact between the Centre and the States that this Council has held so dear since the introduction of the GST regime,” Mr. Jayakumar noted.

However, he said, the clear and explicit statement in the note (circulated earlier) that under the operative sections of the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, compensation was payable for the entire shortfall in revenue collection, even if it was not on account of the GST implementation, was heartening. The position was clarified by the Attorney-General and accepted by the Central government. “It has also been stated that the balance shortfall will be made good in subsequent years. It is important that this position is explicitly reiterated in a formal communication to the States,” the Minister said.

‘Grave urgency’

During 2020-21, for the period up to July 2020, a GST compensation of ₹12,258.94 crore was due to Tamil Nadu. “It is a matter of grave urgency that the GST compensation payments are made immediately to enable us to continue to battle against COVID-19,” he said. The Minister underlined that it had been Tamil Nadu’s consistent stand that the Centre had a moral and legal obligation to pay the compensation for the shortfall in GST collections.

He also recalled Tamil Nadu’s stand at the 41st GST Council meeting that the Centre could mobilise resources and lend the funds required to the GST Compensation Fund. “The loan could then be serviced through an extension of the GST Cess for a few years beyond 2021-22. This was a very reasonable and practical suggestion and was agreed to by almost all States,” he said.

The Group of Ministers (GoM), constituted for examining the issue of the IGST settlement for 2017-18, has finalised its report, which acknowledged that ₹4,321 crore was due to Tamil Nadu towards the IGST settlement. “I look forward to an immediate release of the dues of Tamil Nadu in one instalment as recommended by the GoM. This will bring succour to the State at this time of grave financial difficulty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. I urge the Centre to accept the recommendation of the GoM and implement it immediately,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8cpbyd/article32777206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th06gst,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gst-compensation-dues-tn-chooses-option-1/article32777207.ece
201,2020/10/06,Stalin promises special courts to hear women’s cases,"He flags off march led by Kanimozhi against the Hathras gang-rape

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Monday promised to set up special courts to hear cases related to violence against women in the State “when the DMK comes to power next year”.

Flagging off the candle-light march of the party’s women’s wing, led by MP Kanimozhi at Little Mount towards the Raj Bhavan on Monday evening against the alleged gang-rape of a girl in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Stalin said that Tamil Nadu, too, had seen a rise in crimes against women under the AIADMK government.

“Uttar Pradesh is number one in violence against women. But Tamil Nadu is in second place. Under this AIADMK government, sexual assaults happened in Pollachi. Have any of the women got any justice? No. That is because those involved are related to people in the ruling party. What happened was that the police arrested a woman for giving a complaint. That is the sad state of affairs here,” Mr. Stalin charged.

Kanimozhi slams BJP

Slamming the BJP, Ms. Kanimozhi said following the Nirbhaya gang-rape case, several laws had been passed to protect women, but the police had failed to act as per these laws. “After the BJP came to power, violence against women, dalit women and children have increased in the country. A CM [Yogi Adityanath] who is keen on saving cows is not protecting women and girl children,” she charged.

She said the BJP was making false claims that there was no rape, no caste-based violence in the case and were instead casting aspersions on the victim.

“This is what the BJP, RSS is doing to women in the country. This anti-women, anti-people BJP government must be thrown out. The Edappadi Palaniswami government here, which supports the BJP, will soon be thrown out,” she said.

As the rally began, police personnel prevented them from proceeding towards Raj Bhavan and detained them near the Saidapet court complex. When the police tried to whisk them away in a bus, cadres squatted on the road and prevented the bus from being moved.

Ms. Kanimozhi descended from the bus and asked the cadre to disperse. Later, the police took her and the protesters and detained them in a community hall. Traffic was completely affected on Anna Salai from Nandanam to Guindy due to the protest.

The Congress, too, held protests across the State. TNCC president K.S. Alagiri led the protest at Kattumannarkoil.

Court-monitored probe

Mr. Stalin said he was not sure whether the CBI will carry out a fair probe in the Hathras case and demanded that a probe be conducted under the supervision of the court. In a statement, Mr. Alagiri too demanded that an investigation into the Hathras case be done by a Supreme Court monitored team.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/s51kfu/article32777195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06STALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stalin-promises-special-courts-to-hear-womens-cases/article32777196.ece
202,2020/10/06,"Palaniswami meets Ministers, leaders","Meeting was preceded by Panneerselvam’s tweet

Chief Minister and AIADMK co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday held consultations with a host of Ministers and senior leaders in the party ahead of the scheduled announcement of the AIADMK’s candidate for the post of Chief Minister during 2021 Assembly election.

In the morning, at the Secretariat, the Chief Minister met Ministers, including P. Thangamani, S.P. Velumani, C.Ve. Shanmugam, Dindigul C. Sreenivasan, R.B.Udhayakumar and O.S. Manian.

In the afternoon, deputy coordinators of the party, K.P. Munusamy and R. Vaithilingam, met Mr. Palaniswami together.

The discussions were preceded by a tweet of Deputy Chief Minister and the party coordinator, O. Panneerselvam, which created a flutter in the political circles.

Options under study

What transpired at the meetings was not fully known but the camps led by the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister were understood to have studied, in the last few days, different options on running the affairs of the party.

While Mr. Panneerselvam is firm on the formation of an 11-member “all-powerful” panel, the other camp is for constituting committees for different purposes, such as seat sharing and election propaganda, which has been the norm in the party at the time of Assembly elections.

Though there appears to be no point of convergence, senior leaders and Ministers are confident that the issue will blow over.

Mr. Panneerselvam’s tweeted: “All my decisions have been in the interests of people of Tamil Nadu and workers of the AIADMK. They will remain so hereafter too.”

Mr. Panneerselvam also quoted a popular saying: “Whatever happened, happened for good! Whatever happens, happens well! Whatever will happen, will happen well!”

Political overtone

Mr. Panneerselvam’s tweet assumed political significance as it was for the first time that he went on record with a message of political overtones after the stormy meeting of the AIADMK’s executive committee exactly a week ago.

At the end of the executive committee meeting, it was announced that the party’s nominee for the Chief Minister would be declared on October 7.

In the afternoon, Mr.Panneerselvam, who reached his home district of Theni on Friday night, left for Chennai, after interacting with a number of his supporters in the last few days.

On Sunday, he, along with Revenue Minister R. B. Udhayakumar and a few other MLAs, visited Usilampatti town to take a look at the site where it had been decided to install a statue of P.K. Mookiah Thevar, a prominent follower of Forward Bloc leader Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar and who was instrumental in establishing a number of educational institutions in the area.

Mr. Panneerselvam’s message was also being viewed in political circles as one that forewarns the party workers “to await a crucial decision”. But a key member of the Deputy Chief Minister’s camp said Mr. Panneerselvam had always been keen on ensuring “unity” in the party, and this had been “illustrated” by the tweet too.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/v4az20/article32777166.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OPSADMKFINANCEMINISTER20202021BUDGETCMEDAPPADIPALANISWA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/palaniswami-meets-ministers-leaders/article32777167.ece
203,2020/10/06,"CM, three Ministers call on Governor","They discussed COVID-19 situation

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and three of his Cabinet colleagues called on Governor Banwarilal Purohit at the Raj Bhavan on Monday to discuss the COVID-19 situation, the Bill providing horizontal reservation for NEET-qualified government school students in medical admission and the bifurcation of Anna University.

Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam, Higher Education Minister K.P. Anbalagan, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar, Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam, Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy and a few other senior officials were present.

After the pandemic broke out, the Chief Minister has been calling on the Governor at regular intervals to present the status report and the details of the government efforts to combat the disease. According to informed sources, the Chief Minister presented a report on the COVID-19 situation. The Ministers were present to offer their inputs on the issues relating to their portfolios, the sources said.

The Assembly passed a Bill to provide 7.5% horizontal reservation to the NEET-qualified students of government schools. The Bill was sent to the Governor for assent.

204,2020/10/06,IOC to review proposed cuts for simplification of Tokyo Olympics,"Proposed cuts include about 50 changes to fringe areas that leave the number of athletes and all sports events untouched for next year

The IOC and local organisers are trying to “simplify” the postponed Tokyo Olympics, promising to save money in what one study says is already the most expensive Summer Olympics on record.

The executive board of the International Olympic Committee is expected to review the proposed cuts on Wednesday. They include about 50 changes to fringe areas that leave the number of athletes — 15,400 for the Olympics and Paralympics — and all sports events untouched for next year.

Also largely untouched will be the opening and closing ceremonies, the heavily sponsored 121-day torch relay, and competition areas that will be seen on television broadcasts. This means the so-called field of play, and areas immediately adjacent.

Some of the proposed cuts listed in a detailed document from the organisers include: fewer decorative banners; a 10%-15% reduction in “stakeholders” delegation sizes; five fewer international interpreters from a staff of 100; fewer shuttle buses; reduction in hospitality areas; suspension in production of mascot costumes; cancellation of official team welcome ceremonies.

Organisers and the IOC say they had already slashed several billion dollars in costs before the Olympics were postponed six months ago because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This included moving events to existing venues rather than building new facilities.

Most of the big-ticket spending had already taken place, such as the $1.43 billion national stadium, and the $520 million swimming venue.

“We have many measures, and sometimes they look small. But when you take them all together it will represent a large result in terms of both simplification and hopefully ... produce some significant savings,” Christophe Dubi, the IOC executive director for the Olympic Games, said late last month when the plans were presented in Tokyo.

Mr. Dubi said a search for more cuts would continue.

Tokyo and the IOC have not offered an estimate of the savings, but estimates in Japan put them at 1-2 per cent of official spending of $12.6 billion.

However, a government audit last year said the real cost of the Olympics might be twice that much.

All of the costs for putting on the Olympics come largely from public money with the exception of $5.6 billion from a privately financed local operating budget. About 60 per cent of the income in this budget — $3.3 billion — comes from payments from 68 domestic sponsors.

Organising committee CEO Toshiro Muto acknowledged last month for the first time that some sponsors have backed out in the midst of a slumping economy, the pandemic, and uncertainty around the Olympics really happening.

“I can’t say that all contracts have been renewed,” he said.

Any shortfall in this privately funded operating budget will have to be made up from somewhere else. The document handed out last month by organisers showed them considering measures to increase donations to make up for lost income.

To keep sponsors on board, the IOC and local organizers have talked confidently in the last several months about the Olympics opening as planned on July 23, 2021.

Yoshiro Mori, the president of the organizing committee, acknowledged last month that some were hoping for more cuts, while others will be satisfied with the modest savings.

“It’s like a glass half-filled, or half empty,” he said.

“We wanted to save, but there were so many thing that have already been determined.”

Organisers have said it won’t be until the end of the year, or early in 2021, when detailed steps will be announced about how to hold the Olympics in the midst of a pandemic. This will include decisions about attendance by local fans, non-Japanese fans, and rules under which athletes will enter Japan, vaccines, quarantines, and so forth.

The Telangana State Public Service Commission (TSPSC) released the results of the Group-IV services on Tuesday for 1,595 vacancies.

207,2020/10/06,"KCR should apologise for not safeguarding TS interests, says BJP","Chief Minister wants to shift the blame on Centre, charges Bandi Sanjay

Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao tender an ‘unqualified apology’ to the people for failing to safeguard the interests of the State in sharing of the Krishna River water during the virtual Apex Council meeting held on Tuesday.

Party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar, in a virtual press conference, lambasted the Chief Minister for not highlighting the project like the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme from Pothireddypadu during the meeting and claimed that not sending the agenda points to the Centre till a day before the scheduled meeting only reflected the ‘dubious’ stance.

The BJP leader questioned the CM’s stance and wondered why the aggressive tone which was displayed earlier on the ‘illegal’ projects being taken up by the Andhra Pradesh government was not highlighted in the meeting. “Chief Minister KCR conveniently wanted to shift the blame on the Centre for his lackadaisical approach towards the new irrigation projects being taken up by the neighbouring State as he had a tacit understanding with the Andhra Pradesh CM,” he charged.

Appreciating the Apex Council for releasing a press note on the proceedings held during the day, Mr. Sanjay Kumar said that otherwise the TRS government would have presented a different picture altogether. “It appears KCR had accepted the failure of his government in not preventing the construction of the projects denying TS the rightful share of water. There was no mention of AP using 170 TMC ft as against the allotted 114 TMC ft last year,” he said.

The TRS government did not bother to release funds for installing telemetric devices which could have provided details of the excess usage of the river water by the AP government, he said and also criticised the KCR for admitting in the meeting that the Palamuru-Rangareddy irrigation project was taken up despite not getting necessary approvals. It only means the project has been taken up to benefit the contractors, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kcr-should-apologise-for-not-safeguarding-ts-interests-says-bjp/article32785809.ece

Speaking after joining the Congress, Mr. Srinivas Reddy said the by-election to Dubbak was a test of self esteem to the people of the State and the Constituency.

210,2020/10/06,Govt will purchase entire paddy and cotton crops from farmers: Telangana CM,"Officials told to ensure farmers are not put to inconvenience

The State government has announced its decision to purchase the entire paddy and cotton crop grown during the Vaanakalam season.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the Agriculture department officials to set up 6,000 paddy procurement centres across the State for purchase of entire produce without inconveniencing the farmers. The government, he reiterated, was committed to extend its helping hand to farmers by providing investment subsidy at the beginning of the crop season till the procurement of grains after the harvesting season.

The Chief Minister reviewed the preparedness of the department relating to procurement of vaanakalam crops with senior officials on Tuesday. The State registered a cropping area of 1.34 crore acres, including paddy in 52.77 lakh acres and cotton in 60.36 lakh acres.

The government had decided to utilise the IKP centres, cooperative societies and Marketing Department for purchasing grain from farmers, he said requesting farmers not to sell their produce in haste and at lower prices. The government was committed to provide support price of ₹ 1,888 a quintal for A-grade paddy within the limits of the moisture content of 17 % and ₹ 1,868 a quintal for B-grade variety.

Farmers should therefore ensure that they bring dried paddy without chaff for getting the support price announced by the government instead of coming to procurement centres with crops with higher moisture content. Steps had been initiated to release guidelines pertaining to paddy procurement in the next couple of days and the Agriculture, Marketing and Civil Supplies departments should ensure effective coordination to see that farmers were not put to difficulties.

Efforts had been intensified to ensure purchase of the entire cotton crop through the Cotton Corporation of India and the government was in constant touch with the CCI officials in this direction. He advised officials concerned to clear the doubts if any the farmers had through the call centres.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/govt-will-purchase-entire-paddy-and-cotton-crops-from-farmers-cm/article32784439.ece

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) has termed the ensuing bye-election to Dubbak Assembly Constituency in Siddipet district not just a formality to elect a new legislator but an exercise having potential to decide the future of Telangana.

In a virtual press meet held on Tuesday, several senior leaders of the party also vowed to put in best of their efforts to snatch the seat from the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) as it did in case of Narayankhed a few years back when bye-election was held for the seat following the death of the then sitting legislator P. Kista Reddy.

Request every elector of the Dubbak constituency to vote for Congress candidate in the bypoll, TPCC president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy said and added that it was necessary to teach a lesson to the ruling family of the State which, he alleged, was resorting to large-scale corruption and had turned the State politics into a commercial activity. He accused the ruling party of resorting to all sorts of irregularities to win every election.

Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy stated that he would camp at Dubbak from Wednesday till completion of the polling and would be available to party rank and file in the constituency. He said the responsibility of election to Nizamabad Local Authorities Constituency was given to senior leader and MLC T. Jeevan Reddy.

Congress Legislature Party (CLP) Leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka suggested that party take up a state-wide campaign on the anti-people decisions of the State government, including the recent Land Regularisation Scheme (LRS). TPCC working president Ponnam Prabhakar said the party was required to go into people with the slogan of giving an opportunity to the voice that questions — raises problems of people at appropriate fora.

Mr. Jeevan Reddy said the bye-election to Dubbak was not only prestigious for the ruling TRS but also to the Opposition Congress and it was an opportunity to expose government’s failures. Former minister J. Geetha Reddy termed the bye-election as a pre-final to the 2023 Assembly elections and suggested that party should work with people displaced by Mallannasagar.

Bhongir MP Komatireddy Venkat Reddy said party could win Dubbak provided the senior leadership put in combined efforts. On his part, he would try to get at least 500 to 1,000 votes more to party candidate in the area allotted to him. Former legislator T. Narsa Reddy said people would vote for Congress if the party leaders stay put in villages during the campaigning.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tpcc-wants-to-wrest-dubbak-from-trs-as-latter-did-in-case-of-narayankhed/article32784150.ece

213,2020/10/06,"TS dissent aside, Centre to notify purview of KRMB, GRMB soon","Office of KRMB to be shifted from Hyderabad to a city in AP

Notifying the purview of the two river boards constituted under the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act — Krishna and Godavari River Management Boards (KRMB and GRMB) — and shifting of the KRMB office from Hyderabad to AP, Amaravati/Vijayawada or any other City, were among the important outcomes of the Apex Council meeting held on Tuesday.

The Ministry of Jal Shakti has taken the decision to notify the purview of the two rivers boards soon in spite of “dissent registered by Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao”. “We have taken the decision to enable the two boards function properly by notifying their purview as the Centre has powers to do so under the provisions of APRA,” Union Minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who chaired the meeting, said.

It is learnt that Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao opposed the proposal to notify the purview of the two river boards in the absence of clarity on share of waters for the two States after bifurcation of combined AP. He insisted that the purview could be decided only after the water shares were decided both in the Krishna and Godavari rivers.

As expected, Chief Minister of Telangana K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, availed the opportunity to put forth their States’ argument on issues related to river waters. While Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao reiterated the injustice being done to Telangana in the matter of river water allocation from the days of combined AP and explained the perennial impact of AP’s plans to divert Krishna water from Srisailam reservoir by taking up a new lift scheme and expanding an existing water drawal system, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy stressed on the impact of projects being executed by Telangana in Godavari Basin.

The Apex Council on water issues between AP and Telangana, that met after a gap of over four years, was a virtual meeting in the wake of COVID-19 for about two hours, was attended by Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao from Pragati Bhavan Hyderabad, Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy from AP Bhavan in New Delhi and officials of Krishna and Godavari River Boards from Jala Soudha in Hyderabad. Senior officials of MoJS, including Secretary U.P. Singh, Advisor Sriram Vedire and others, participated along with Mr. Shekhawat.

Mr. Shekhawat stated after the meeting that the two States had also agreed to submit the detailed project reports (DPRs) of new projects taken up by them for appraisal and approval by the respective river boards. However, no clarity was given on the definition of the “new project” since the two States have been contending that the projects being executed in the recent years or planned to be executed soon were not new projects but extension of the existing ones.

The issue of working out a fool-proof mechanism to discuss and decided on the water disputes, including sharing, was also discussed at length, the Union Minister said. He termed the meeting as very productive since the two States were willing to find a solution to disputes. Mr. Shekhawat felt that the Apex Council should meet at least once a year, from now on, for taking forward the outstanding issues.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ts-dissent-aside-centre-to-notify-purview-of-krmb-grmb-soon/article32783892.ece

217,2020/10/06,"False affidavit filed by U.P. to cover up Hathras, says Congress","Party seeks immediate removal of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath

The Congress on Tuesday accused the Uttar Pradesh government of ‘lying’ to the Supreme Court by filing a false affidavit in an attempt to ‘cover up’ the Hathras incident and demanded the immediate removal of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.

Also read: Hathras gang rape | Rahul, Priyanka meet victim’s family

In its affidavit, the government justified the decision to cremate the victim with “all religious rituals” at night as the local administration had received intelligence inputs of violence in the morning, and attached medical reports that claimed “absence of any signs of rape”.

At a joint press conference, All India Mahila Congress (AIMC) chief Sushmita Dev, former Rajya Sabha member Rajani Patil and spokepserson Supriya Shrinate described the affidavit as “full of white lies” and asserted that it amounted to contempt of court.

“Every step taken by the Uttar Pradesh government was to cover up the entire Hathras episode. Today, this has been exposed in the form of the affidavit filed by Uttar Pradesh government. The purpose of this affidavit is not for a court-monitored CBI probe but to cover up the incident,” Ms. Dev said.

‘Stop the cover-up’

“Stop the cover-up. The Congress stands by its demand that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath should be dismissed with immediate effect. The district magistrate and every officer who is a part of this conspiracy to hush up such a brutal case of rape should be dismissed and not given any other responsibility pending investigation,” she added.

Ms. Shrinate alleged that the government was trying to make it a case of international conspiracy “through fabricated evidence” and project that protests over the Hathras incident would lead to caste violence in the State.

She read out portions of the government affidavit, in which there are references to ‘black lives’, ‘American cities like San Diego and Phoenix’, and the ‘New York police department’. “As they say, even to copy, you need brains. They have made a total mockery of this affidavit,” she said.

Ms. Shrinate asked why there is no official notification of the CBI inquiry into the Hathras incident as announced by the State government, and alleged a conspiracy by the administration to resort to victim-shaming.

Ms. Dev condemned the government for its ‘claim’ of ‘no rape’ despite the victim’s dying declaration and for assertion that proper religious rituals were followed during the cremation. “ This is a case of contempt. There should be a case of contempt of court. Prime Minister Narendra Modi should dismiss Yogi Adityanath as Chief minister,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/2yg39s/article32281216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THMain2NTHGGS17LA9IT3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/false-affidavit-filed-by-up-to-cover-up-hathras-says-congress/article32784715.ece

The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-affiliated trade union, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), on Tuesday announced that it would hold protests on October 28 against the “anti-worker” provisions of the recently passed labour codes and threatened a national strike if the Centre does not address its demands.

At its three-day national conference held virtually from October, the BMS elected new office-bearers and passed six resolutions regarding demands of workers, the outgoing general secretary Virjesh Upadhyay said at an online press conference. Former BMS vice-president Hiranmay Pandya was elected as the union’s national president, he said.

BMS had decided to carry out a continuous national agitation against the “anti-worker” provisions of the labour codes, three of which were passed by Parliament last month, newly-elected BMS general secretary Binay Kumar Sinha said.

3 labour codes get President's assent

In its first resolution, the BMS demanded that the government immediately withdraw the provisions, including those curtailing the right to strike in the Industrial Relations Code, that would be detrimental to workers, he said. The government should hold a consultation with all unions to make the labour codes more beneficial to workers, he said.

The BMS would observe October 10-16 as a “warning week” and to educate workers about the changes, he said. Protests would be held on October 28 and if the “voice of workers” is ignored by the government, then national level strikes would be organised, he said.

A wage code that is a hasty composition

The BMS also passed resolutions against the Centre and States amending labour laws through ordinances and called for a single pension system in the country which provides a pension not less than 50% of the last salary and a minimum pension of ₹5,000 for the unorganised sector.

Amid high-drama at Haryana’s border with Punjab, State authorities allowed former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and a few party leaders to enter the BJP-ruled State as part of his rally against farm laws.

After winding up his last rally at Sanaur in Patiala, Mr. Gandhi drove a tractor to reach Haryana border on the concluding day of his “Kheti Bachao Yatra”.

He was accompanied on the tractor by Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and senior party leader Harish Rawat.

A number of Congress workers were accompanying Gandhi from Punjab’s Patiala district, but the procession was stopped on the highway near Teokar village on Pehowa border for an hour.

Before Gandhi arrived at the Punjab-Haryana border, senior Haryana police officials at the spot told reporters that they would not allow more than 100 people to gather at one place as per the guidelines in place due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions.

Mr. Gandhi and a few Congress leaders were later allowed to enter Haryana where the former Congress chief has a couple of programmes scheduled.

On Haryana side, State Congress chief Kumari Selja, senior leaders Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Randeep Singh Surjewala, Kiran Choudhary, Ajay Singh Yadav and party’s Haryana affairs in-charge Vivek Bansal were present.

Ahead of Gandhi’s tractor rally in Haryana, the BJP-led government on Monday had said the Congress leader can bring a few people in the State but it will not permit a big crowd from Punjab which can “disturb” the atmosphere.

Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that Mr. Gandhi has the right to put forth his views but “if he comes with a big procession from Punjab, we won’t allow it”.

220,2020/10/06,Ex-Assam DIG held on India-Nepal border,"Prasanta Kumar Dutta was absconding after SI recruitment test scam came to light in Sept.

A former Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of police of Assam, one of the main accused in a scam involving the recruitment of unarmed sub-inspectors, was been detained on the India-Nepal border on October 6.

A statement issued by the State police headquarters in Guwahati said Prasanta Kumar Dutta was detained on the basis of a look-out circular issued by the Crime Investigation Department (CID).

“Now, [he was] handed over to West Bengal police. The Assam police would take him into custody in due course and bring him to Assam,” the statement said.

The State Level Police Recruitment Board (SLPRB) had scheduled the exam for appointing 597 sub-inspectors on September 20. But it was cancelled while some 66,000 candidates were writing their answers after a copy of the paper was leaked on social media.

A probe revealed that 50 candidates had sat for a “written test” based on handwritten copies of the question paper at a guest-house near the Assam Assembly on September 19. Copies of the question paper were allegedly sold for up to ₹4 lakh.

The SLPRB rescheduled the exam on November 22 after retired IPS officer Deepak Kumar quit as its chairman, owning moral responsibility for the question paper leak.

BJP leader’s involvement

The CID also found the involvement of Mr. Dutta and Diban Deka, a BJP leader, who was arrested after he surrendered at a police station in western Assam’s Bajali district on September 30.

A week ago, the police learnt that Mr. Dutta and his son had fled to Nepal after the question paper leak came to light. Reports said he owned a chain of luxury hotels, tea estates, large swathes of land and several apartments.

The leak had rattled the BJP, which suspended Mr. Deka from its primary membership. Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, also in charge of the Home Department, had ordered a thorough probe into the case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ex-assam-dig-held-on-india-nepal-border/article32783188.ece
221,2020/10/06,LeT militants behind Monday’s attack on CRPF personnel in J&K identified: IGP Kashmir,"“We are conducting operations and soon they will be neutralised,” Vijay Kumar, Inspector General of Police, Kashmir Zone, said.

The Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) militants behind Monday’s attack on Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) road-opening party in Nowgam area on Jammu-Srinagar National Highway in Jammu and Kashmir, have been identified, a senior police official said on Tuesday. In the attack, two personnel were killed and three injured.

“We have identified the militants behind the attack. They are from the Lashkar, led by a Pakistani terrorist named Saifullah. We are on the job and they will be neutralised soon,” Inspector General of Police (IGP), Kashmir Zone Vijay Kumar said.

He was speaking to reporters after the wreath-laying ceremony for the two CRPF jawans, who were killed in the attack.

“Two militants came on a scooter, most probably from the Pampore side and opened indiscriminate firing from an AK rifle,” the IGP said. He admitted that the module of the Pakistan-based militant outfit had carried out an attack earlier in the Chadoora area of Budgam district as well, in which an assistant sub-inspector of the CRPF was killed.

“We are conducting operations and soon, they will be neutralised,” the officer said.

Responding to a question on militants using two-wheelers to carry out attacks, Mr. Kumar said it is easy for the ultras to move around on motorbikes on roads where the vehicle movement is heavy.

“We cannot check every vehicle, vehicles are checked based on information mostly. Checking every vehicle will cause traffic jams,” he said.

The IGP sought to assure people, saying there is no need to panic and “the situation is under control”.

On the use of virtual phone numbers by militants, he said this technology is a cause of concern but it has been used for subversive activities for years now. “Virtual numbers have remained challenging since the beginning. It is challenging across the world. We are trying to find technological answers,” Mr. Kumar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/let-militants-behind-mondays-attack-on-crpf-personnel-in-jk-identified-igp-kashmir/article32782907.ece
222,2020/10/06,"Meghalaya police probing ‘harassment’ of non-tribal women, children","A local woman had lodged a complaint with the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

The Meghalaya police have begun investigating allegations of “institutionalised harassment” of non-tribal women and children in areas bordering Bangladesh.

The alleged incidents were connected to the February 28 violence in East Khasi Hills district’s Ichamati. A leader of the Khasi Students’ Union (KSU), a tribe-specific organisation, died in the violence.

The probe followed a directive from the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to Sylvester Nongtnger, district Superintendent of Police (SP), on September 30.

The NCPCR had taken cognisance of a written complaint by one Gayatri Borpatra Gohain, a resident of the area, routed through the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

In the letter to Mr. Nongtnger, the Commission said the complainant had complained about “ongoing incidents of institutionalised harassment of women and children in Bholaganj, Ichamati, Kalibari and Kalatek villages” in the district concerned.

“She [Ms Gohain] has alleged that due to the above incident, the children and women are facing terrible harassment from armed insurgent groups and also from the administration,” the NCPCR wrote. The complainant, however, did not specify the nature of harassment.

‘Matter of serious concern’

“The alleged harassment caused to the children of non-tribal families... is a matter of serious concern and a clear indication of inaction and lapse on the part of administration and police in maintaining law and order situation of the area. A strict vigil may be required in maintaining law and order situation of the area and any culprits found should be dealt with under relevant provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015,” the Commission wrote.

It sought details on the number of children affected due to the violence, names of the groups and police personnel allegedly harassing the children, the kind of action taken by the police to ensure the safety and security of children and if any FIR was registered in this regard.

The SP was also asked to submit the inquiry report by October 7.

“An Additional SP is conducting the investigation and the report will be submitted on time,” Mr. Nongtnger said.

Limestone export trade

Ichamati and adjoining areas are known for limestone export trade with Bangladesh. The areas are inhabited by Bengali Hindus and Muslims, and a smattering of Assamese, Bodo, Hajong and Garo communities.

On February 28, a meeting convened by the KSU to discuss the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and demand for bringing Meghalaya under the ambit of the Inner-Line Permit led to clashes between members of the organisation and the locals.

The police had arrested some 70 people after the death of the KSU leader during the violence.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/8lcvn/article27690220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-ncpcr-twitterNCPCR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/meghalaya-police-probing-harassment-of-non-tribal-women-children/article32782019.ece
223,2020/10/06,Assam announces annual grant for scribes,"It’s for those ‘without affiliation to any political party’

Less than a year ahead of the State polls, the Assam government has announced an annual grant for development-oriented journalists “without affiliation to any political party”.

The grant of ₹50,000 each for 20 journalists from the current fiscal will be awarded for at least three “success stories” of the government in the past 12 months published or broadcast. Photojournalists and videojournalists, who produce similar work through a series of pictures and films, have also been made eligible for the grant.

Officials of the Department of Information and Public Relations (DIPR), which has been tasked with forming a committee to select the journalists for the grant, said the scheme was proposed during the 2019-2020 fiscal.

“This is an extension of a fellowship on developmental and socio-economic issues of similar amount for an equal number of scribes that was started during the 2018-2019 fiscal. The grant differs from the fellowship in certain aspects,” a senior DIPR official said on October 6, adding that candidates for the grant would be selected only if they are found to be politically neutral.

“For the fellowship, an applicant needs to have worked independently or for a media house for at least three years and produce a minimum number of stories after selection. The grant will be awarded on the basis of stories and photos already published and videos broadcast by journalists whose minimum age should be 40 years with no upper limit,” the official stated.

15 years of experience

According to the guidelines issued by Preetam Saikia, Commissioner-Secretary for the Information and Public Relations Department, an applicant must have at least 15 years of experience and his or her “affiliation to any political party will be termed a disqualification”.

An applicant must not have been convicted for any offence or punished by any court of law or reprimanded by the Press Council of India for misconduct or violation of ethnics of journalism or for every other relative motive, the conditions state. Other conditions are that an applicant’s annual income must be less that ₹5 lakh, should be a resident of Assam and should be an accredited or recognised journalist of the State.

Certain schemes for journalists were started by the Congress government led by Tarun Gogoi. They include distributing laptops ahead of the 2011 Assembly elections and a medical welfare scheme for accredited and recognised journalists from 2012-2013 fiscal onwards.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-announces-annual-grant-for-scribes/article32781576.ece
224,2020/10/06,Four get life term for raping Dalit woman in Rajasthan’s Alwar,"Incident caused widespread outrage in State after footage of crime was released on social media

A special court in Alwar on Tuesday sentenced four men to rigorous life imprisonment for raping a 19-year-old Dalit woman at Thanagazi in 2019 and sentenced another to five years in jail.

The gang rape on April 26, 2019, had caused widespread outrage in Rajasthan after the crime was recorded and the footage was released on social media.

A special court for SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act cases held the four men — Hansraj Gujjar, Indraj Gujjar, Ashok Kumar and Chhote Lal — guilty under Section 376-D (gang rape) and other provisions of Indian Penal Code, and the fifth, Mukesh Gujjar, under the Information Technology Act. Among those awarded the life sentence, Hansraj Gujjar was ordered to be imprisoned till his death.

All the convicts are in the age group of 20 to 23 years. They had raped the Dalit woman in front of her husband after waylaying the couple, who were travelling on a motorcycle, on the Thanagazi-Alwar bypass road and dragging them to a deserted area. Mukesh Gujjar filmed the crime and later circulated the footage on social media.

The court also imposed a fine of ₹1 lakh each on those sentenced to life imprisonment and ₹50,000 on Mukesh Gujjar. The full amount of fine will be paid to the victim.

The Congress government in the State faced criticism over delay in registration of first information report (FIR) in the case, which took a political twist, with the Opposition BJP alleging that the police had turned away the victim and delayed action in view of the May 6, 2019, polling for the Lok Sabha election. The FIR was registered on May 2, 2019.

After the arrest of the accused, the charge sheet was filed promptly in the court and the victim was given a government job as a police constable. The State government took several measures to prevent crimes against women, including a new provision for registration of FIR in the office of the Superintendent of Police, in the aftermath of the incident.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/m84b08/article32722367.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16DECTH--RAPE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/four-get-life-term-for-raping-dalit-woman-in-rajasthans-alwar/article32781447.ece
225,2020/10/06,Sushant Singh Rajput's sisters move Bombay High Court to quash FIR filed by Rhea Chakraborty,"The Bombay High Court adjourned the matter for October 13

Late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s sisters Priyanka and Meetu Singh moved the Bombay High Court on Tuesday to quash the FIR filed against them by actor Rhea Chakraborty.

Advocate Varun Singh representing the sisters appeared before a division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and M.S. Karnik. He said the FIR was registered on September 7 and needs to be quashed as it is not maintainable.

He said Sushant died on June 14 and Priyanka left his home on June 8. He said there was a news article that said Priyanka along with a doctor prescribed some medicines to Sushant and then she was booked for abetment of suicide and provisions of Narcotics Drugs Psychotropic Substances Act.

The petition states, “No criminality can be attributed to the petitioners when the cause of action is attributed to the doctor. The FIR has been registered based on a complaint which is wrought with material irregularities and discrepancies. The FIR has been registered after inordinate delay of 90 days without explanation”.

When advocate Satish Maneshinde’s lawyer representing Ms. Chakraborty sought some time as he was before another Bench, the Court said, “There is no urgency. We don’t want to interfere at this stage”.

The Court then asked if the investigation is still going on. Since there was no one to represent the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Bench directed Mr. Singh to serve the agency and adjourned the matter for October 13.

The sisters have been booked sections 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 464 (making a false document, 465 (punishment for forgery), 466 (forgery of record of court or of public register, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 474 (having possesion of document), 306 (abetment of suicide) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.

Along with sections 8 (1) - prohibition of certain activities relating to property derived from offence, 21 (punishment for contravention in relation to manufactured drugs and preparation), 22 (punishment for contravention in relation to psychotropic substances) and 29 (punishment for abetment and criminal conspiracy) of the NDPS.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hqa9kw/article32547599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08-MEETU-SINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sushant-singh-rajputs-sisters-move-bombay-high-court-to-quash-fir-filed-by-rhea-chakraborty/article32781290.ece

A Delhi-based journalist working for Malayalam news portals was among four people arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police when they were on their way to Hathras.

Also read: KUWJ moves Supreme Court against scribe’s detention

The arrests came hours after the State police, under fire for their handling of the Hathras rape and murder case, had claimed there was a conspiracy to defame the State government and trigger caste riots over the Hathras incident.

The four were taken into custody at a toll plaza in Mathura when they were travelling in a car from Delhi to Hathras, said police late on Monday. The car was stopped after police found their activities suspicious, following which they were taken into custody, added the Mathura police.

Also read: Hathras gang rape | A long caste feud, a horrific crime, and a sudden cremation

The four were identified as Ateeq-ur-Rehman, Siddiqui Kappan, Masood Ahmed and Alam. Mr. Kappan is a journalist working for several Malayalam media houses and had reportedly gone to Hathras to cover the case on Monday.

The Kerala Union of Working Journalists, in a letter to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, has demanded the release of Mr. Kappan, saying he was trying to perform his duty as a reporter.

“The Hathras police station and State police department have not provided any information so far on taking him into custody,” said Miji Jose, president of the KUWJ.

K. P Reji, president of the KUWJ state committee Thiruvananthapuram, also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for Mr. Kappan's immediate release. ""Our relentless efforts to contact him were in vain. The Hathras Police Station and the State Police department has not provided any information so far on taking him into custody,"" Mr. Reji wrote.

K.N. Ashok, editor of news portal Azhimukham, said Mr. Kappan was a regular contributor and was covering many beats, including politics.

“Yesterday [October 5], early in the morning, he sent a message that he is going to cover Hathras. That is the only information we got from him,” Mr. Ashok said.

Mr. Ashok said that they tried to contact Mr. Kappan in the evening but could not get a response. At night, they got to know that he had been apprehended by the U.P. police, said Mr. Ashok.

Mr. Kappan is also an elected secretary of the KUWJ. “Police have not informed us about the arrest,” Mr. Ashok said.

Ms. Jose also said, “Our efforts and the efforts by some advocates based in Delhi to contact him were not successful.”

The Mathura police said “suspicious literature, one that could have an adverse impact on peace,” was recovered from the four. However, police are yet to reveal the content or state the laws the literature violated.

In their statement, police did not acknowledge that Mr. Kappan is a journalist and claimed that the four in custody were linked to the Popular Front of India and its related group Campus Front of India.

The PFI was last December blamed by the U.P. government for vandalism that took place in Lucknow and other parts of the State during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Further legal action will be taken after questioning the four, said police.

Even after it came to light that Mr. Kappan is a journalist, the U.P. police are yet to issue a clarification.

PFI responds

The Popular Front of India condemned the arrest, terming it deplorable and illegal. The PFI accused the U.P. government of targeting it to hide the failing law and order situation in the State and divert attention from the Hathras issue by creating a “conspiracy theory.”

“Popular Front will not be intimidated by such tactics of suppression by the U.P. government. We demand the immediate release of the CFI leaders and journalist Siddique Kappan,” said Anis Ahmed, general secretary, PFI.

The illegal arrest shows that in U.P., under the Yogi Adityanath government, even intending to meet families of victims is now considered a crime, he added.

Meanwhile, police said that one of the arrested persons Masood Ahmed of Bahraich was a student of Jamia Millia Islamia University and that, if required, economic intelligence agencies would be roped into probe the ""foreign funding"" angle. His messages, linkages and data obtained from him would be probed, said an officer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9yoa9d/article32762292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hathras-barricade,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/4-men-with-links-to-pfi-held-near-hathras/article32779414.ece

West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh on Monday alleged that the law and order situation in the State is worsening and gradually it is becoming a Mafia-ruled State like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

In reply, the Trinamool Congress said it is good that he accepted that Mafia-raj existed in those two States where the BJP is in power.

“West Bengal is slipping into a Mafia-raj like situation like in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The way a councillor was shot dead in front of a police station by using a stengun is shameful,” Mr Ghosh said while talking to the media on the killing of BJP leader Manish Shukla at Titagarg in North 24 Parganas district.

Shukla, a councillor of Titagarh Municipality, was shot dead on Sunday by two bike-borne assailants.

“The law and order situation of Bengal is worsening with each passing day. The police are hand in glove in the conspiracy to kill a mass leader like Shukla,” Mr Ghosh claimed.

Mr Ghosh wondered whether free and fair polls would be possible in the State if such an anarchic situation continues.

The Assembly election in the State is due next year.

“More than 120 BJP workers have been killed in the state in the last few years,” he said.

230,2020/10/06,Over 2 lakh farmers register to sell groundnut at MSP in Gujarat,"Procurement will be made at ₹1,055 for 20 kg

More than two lakh farmers have already registered themselves to sell their groundnut in Gujarat in the State-aided procurement process at the minimum support price (MSP).

The registration process opened on October 1 and the procurement process will begin on October 21.

The State government’s first advance estimate has projected groundnut crop at an all time high of 54.65 lakh tonne for kharif 2020. Gujarat is the largest producer of the oil seed with almost 50% share of the production.

The procurement will be made at an MSP of ₹1,055 for 20 kg. The Central government agency will be procuring the groundnut at a time when farmers in the State have suffered extensive damage due to continuous rainfall this monsoon, which hugely affected the oil seed growing region Saurashtra.

“As on Monday evening, around 2.10 lakh farmers have enrolled in the procurement process,” said Civil Supply Secretary Mohammad Shahid. The Civil Supplies department is the nodal agency to facilitate the procurement.

Mr. Shahid said 4.7 lakh farmers had enrolled last year.

According to the sources, 25% of the stock will be procured by the Central government through the State civil supply department from the farmers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/over-2-lakh-farmers-register-to-sell-groundnut-at-msp-in-gujarat/article32776776.ece
231,2020/10/06,Visva Bharati University to outsource security; armed guards will protect campus,"The Visva Bharati University at Santiniketan — where trees and hedges have decided its boundaries for decades — has decided to outsource security for the campus, which will include deployment of armed guards. The institution has invited bids for the same, with the estimated value of the contract about ₹7 crore.

A notification inviting e-tenders was issued late last month. Bidders are required to have an average gross turnover of ₹20 crore per year with at least three contracts of not less than ₹1 crore each per year in the last five years.

The Rabindranath Tagore-founded institution is looking to deploy close to 300 personnel on a daily basis in the campus, and wants them to have served in the Armed Forces and Central Armed Police Forces. The security will include guards who will be armed with single/double barrel and pump action guns.

“Opening fire in any post should be the last option left with the armed guard, after shouting precautionary words and firing should start with blank cartridge only. Live cartridge should be fired initially aiming towards the sky, followed by firing below the knee,” the notice inviting tenders said.

The successful bidder will be hired, initially, for a period of one year. The agency, apart from providing round-the-clock security on the premises, will carry out patrolling, control movement of vehicles, keep a check on hawkers and vendors, and prevent ragging and also smoking and consumption of alcohol and “indecent activities” on the campus. Guards will also keep an eye on tourists.

The new arrangement is likely to be in place by November this year. While Visva Bharati could do with enhanced security — in 2004, Tagore’s Nobel Prize medal was stolen — it remains to be seen whether such elaborate arrangements armed guards included, go down well with the inmates and the local population. One of the top priorities of the present Vice-Chancellor, Bidyut Chakrabarty, appears to be securing the premises of the university by constructing high walls, a move that has not only upset old-timers but also led to a violent confrontation with the locals.

With the Calcutta High Court ruling last month that the authorities cannot build walls without the approval of a four-member committee set up by the court, it appears that the university now wants to throw a security ring around its property by entrusting its protection to an outside agency.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/visva-bharati-university-to-outsource-security-armed-guards-will-protect-campus/article32776939.ece

Announcing this, Supriya Sule, Lok Sabha MP, said, “We must eliminate the prejudice that we have towards the queer community and be more inclusive towards alternative gender identities and gender expression. Work needs to be done for making a more inclusive society free from prejudice, homophobia and transphobia.”

Ms. Sule said that NCP is the only party to talk of liberal values and equality in its speeches and practice it in real life. “It was our party president Sharad Pawar who first implemented women’s reservation as chief minister of Maharashtra. We were the first to form a special wing for young women and will now this new cell is an attempt to cover the LGBTQ community, under a political party,” she added.

Priya Patil, who was appointed as president of the LGBTQ cell, said the formation of this cell as a branch under a political party is a significant step in the fight to claim equal rights. “We will be raising our voices for the welfare and betterment of the community and work to ensure equal rights for them,” she said.

234,2020/10/06,"Hathras case: RSS, BJP view women as commodities, says Prakash Ambedkar","Attacking the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the alleged gang rape of a 19-year-old girl in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar on Monday said that the Sangh and its political arm envisaged women only as “commodities”.

Mr. Ambedkar, the grandson of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, also lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his “conspicuous silence” over the crime in Uttar Pradesh.

“The heinous Hathras incident has been protested at all levels of society…The younger generation is now looking at the oppression of women from a different perspective. In this changing scenario, it is worth noting that the mentality of the RSS-BJP throughout has been to propagate this notion of women as objects of consumption,” the VBA leader said in Pune after a protest against the Hathras crime.

Stating that it was heartening to see youth coming out in large numbers to protest crimes against women, Mr. Ambedkar said that youngsters today were more conscious of the basic rights of a woman.

“Youngsters recognise that a woman, too, has inalienable rights and that she should be able to live the way she wants to. The new generation has no toleration against such brutal oppression of women. The fact that they are hitting the streets in such great numbers across the country is evidence of this fact,” he said.

A lawyer himself, the VBA chief said that the U.P. police and the Special Investigation Team had no right to ‘threaten’ the kin of the victim.

Censuring the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in U.P., Mr. Ambedkar said, “Who is giving the officials these instructions to intimidate the victim’s family? It can only be the political leadership of U.P.. Hence, the victim’s family has demanded that a judge be appointed by the Supreme Court to inquire into the matter and that the probe be monitored by the apex court. We fully support this demand,” he said.

Mr. Ambedkar came down heavily on the Prime Minister’s silence on this matter, dubbing him as ‘Mauni Baba’.

“I only appeal to the youth not to fall prey to whatever propaganda being purveyed by the ruling government,” he said.

Meanwhile, senior BJP leader and Union Minister Raosaheb Danve took jibes at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s discomfiture during his first attempt to meet the kin of the victim, alleging that crowds, and not the U.P. police, had jostled the Congress MP causing him to fall down.

“It is not true that the police pushed Mr. Gandhi... He fell down owing to the jostling mob…It only proves that he does not have enough experience of mingling with crowds,” Mr. Danve said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/hathras-case-rss-bjp-view-women-as-commodities-says-prakash-ambedkar/article32777353.ece

237,2020/10/06,Rajasthan Royals set up academy in Dubai,"Boys and girls between six and 19 will receive training

Rajasthan Royals is setting up an academy in Dubai, one of the host cities of the on-going IPL.

The academy, the first in UAE for an IPL franchise, will be launched on October 12.

This is the second international academy for Royals, having established one in England last year.

Former Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer is the director of the academy, which is being run in partnership with the UAE-based sports consulting firm RedBear Sports.

Boys and girls between six and 19 will receive training at the Sevens Stadium, the facilities of which have been used by the international and the IPL teams.

“The large subcontinent population makes the UAE a great place for cricket to grow and expand and we are delighted to support this process and to strengthen the already rapidly improving UAE national side,” said Jake Lush McCrum, COO, Rajasthan Royals.

Will Kitchen, co-owner, RedBear Sports LLC, said: “We believe that (with) the combination of their expertise, our knowledge of player development... we will be able to offer young players in Dubai an unrivalled experience, and for those with potential, the opportunity to progress towards the IPL.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/i57ci5/article32786097.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07ROYALS-ACADEMY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/rajasthan-royals-set-up-academy-in-dubai/article32786098.ece
238,2020/10/06,IPL 2020 | Y. Prithvi Raj replaces injured Bhuvneshwar in the Sunrisers Hyderabad squad,"I wasn’t expecting this call, says the left-arm fast bowler

Left-arm pacer Y. Prithvi Raj, who was named by Sunrisers Hyderabad as a replacement for the injured Bhuvneshwar Kumar on Tuesday, said he would try to keep things simple and give his best whenever he gets a chance.

“Honestly, I was not expecting this call. I did not have any expectations. I came here as a net bowler to show what I am capable of,” Prithvi told The Hindu.

“Well, this is a huge opportunity which has come my way because of Bhuvi bhai’s injury. Expectations will always be there. But, I will go with a blank mind and try to do what best I can,” the left-arm pacer said.

“Absolutely no chance of reaching anywhere near Bhuvi bhai’s standard as he is one of the top five bowlers in the world. But, I am not going to take any pressure and will try to keep improving,” Prithvi said.

“Being the net bowler for SRH ever since the team landed in UAE has definitely helped me. The support staff comprising some big names of world cricket always taught me one thing — to stick to my strengths,” he said, revealing that his stock ball is the one that comes into the right-hander.

“The atmosphere in the team is amazing and I feel like one of the family members,” he said.There is a connect with every member and that is making me feel I am in the comfort zone,” Prithvi said.

239,2020/10/06,"Indian Premier League 2020 | Suryakumar, Bumrah fire Mumbai Indians to third straight win","Suryakumar’s unbeaten 79 powers the defending champion; Boult, Bumrah and Pattinson derail Royals’ chase

In addition to having a battery of reliable all-rounders, one of the features of Mumbai Indians’ consistent success in the Indian Premier League over the years has been its all-round performance on the field.

This was on full display at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday, as a well-oiled MI machine reversed its adverse recent head-to-head record against Rajasthan Royals with a stylish 57-run win.

Suryakumar Yadav’s personal best in the IPL (79 n.o., 47b, 11x4, 2x6), supported by captain Rohit Sharma (35, 23b, 2x4, 3x6) at the top and Hardik Pandya (30 n.o., 19b, 2x4, 1x6) at the death, helped MI pile on a formidable 193 for four after electing to bat.

Fizz out of the chase

Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah — the Indian pace spearhead using the new ball for the first time this season — then reduced Royals to 12 for three in the third over to take the fizz out of the chase.

And just when Jos Buttler (70, 44b, 4x4, 5x6) started to cut loose, Kieron Pollard pulled off a stunner on the boundary line. Despite misjudging the ball for a split second, Pollard leapt high and caught the ball on the second attempt.

Superman-like dive

This effort was as spectacular as the Superman-like dive from substitute Anukul Roy — fielding in place of Suryakumar, who was hit on the helmet — to dismiss Mahipal Lomror.

Bumrah then ran through the tail to end Royals’ innings for 136, handing MI a comprehensive win. It also helped the defending champion regain the top position, although it has played a match more than second-placed Delhi Capitals.

Earlier, Suryakumar, having driven leggie Shreyas Gopal inside-out with panache, suffered a painful blow on his helmet in the penultimate over of MI’s innings, bowled by Jofra Archer, who consistently clocked 150kmph.

But it was Suryakumar’s response — gliding a near-perfect wide yorker over third-man for six — that underlined that it was his and MI’s night.

240,2020/10/06,Indian Premier League 2020 | Karthik faces stiffest test as Kolkata takes on Chennai,"The pitch in Sharjah is a batsmen’s paradise and both teams cantered past the 200-mark but it’s the bowlers who made the difference in a close chase.

Under-fire Kolkata Knight Riders captain Dinesh Karthik will have to figure out urgent fixes for his star-studded team’s faltering performances when it takes on a resurgent Chennai Super Kings in the IPL here on Wednesday.

KKR acquired England’s World Cup-winning skipper Eoin Morgan but the management reposed confidence in Karthik and asked him to lead the side.

However, a few of his baffling decisions apart from his own poor run with the bat — 37 runs from four matches — has put the Indian wicketkeeper-batsman in the line of fire.

Promoting himself ahead of the star duo of Morgan and Andre Russell and preferring Sunil Narine in the opening slot over Big Bash sensation Tom Banton — who has been compared with Kevin Pietersen — has put 35-year-old Karthik in the dock.

Narine has looked woefully out of sorts, managing only 27 runs from four matches at 87.09 strike rate and it’s high time that the team brings in the big-hitting English youngster.

KKR have plenty of resources in bowling but Karthik, it seems, has not been able to manage them well and their match against Delhi Capitals could be a case in point.

Pat Cummins’ not-so-impressive performance has added to the team’s woes.

The pitch in Sharjah is a batsmen’s paradise and both teams cantered past the 200-mark but it’s the bowlers who made the difference in a close chase.

The pair of Morgan and Rahul Tripathi looked to seal it but Delhi’s bowlers strangulated KKR’s batting at the death.

Karthik will need to back his bowlers, especially Indian lead spinner Kuldeep Yadav who seems to have been under-utilised and bowled just nine overs after being dropped from the Delhi game.

Chennai, on the other hand, rediscovered some of the form that made them three-time champions. After three losses on the trot, the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side would look to make its ascent to top-four from being at the bottom.

Not known to tweak his side much, Dhoni persisted with Shane Watson and the Aussie veteran finally came to form with an unbeaten 83.

Chasing 179 against Kings XI Punjab, Watson and Faf du Plessis made light work of their bowlers in a record 181-run unbeaten stand to seal the chase.

The coming to form of a mis-firing top order is what CSK needed to come out of a miserable start and having done that, they would certainly look favourites against a struggling KKR.

Afghanistan’s top-order batsman Najeeb Tarakai has died of the injuries he sustained in a road accident last weekend, the country’s Cricket Board (ACB) said on Tuesday.

He was 29.

The Afghanistan Cricket Board had on Saturday tweeted that Tarakai was “severely injured in a car accident” suffered on October 2 and had undergone a surgery.

According to ACB, Tarakai, who was initially treated in Nangarhar, was expected to be shifted to Kabul or outside the country as soon as possible.

“ACB and Afghanistan Cricket Loving Nation mourns the heart breaking & grievous loss of its aggressive opening batsman & a very fine human being Najeeb Tarakai (29) who lost his life to tragic traffic accident leaving us all shocked!,” the ACB tweeted.

“May Allah Shower His Mercy on him,” it added.

Tarakai represented the national team in 12 T20Is and one ODI.

The right-handed batsman made his international debut at the 2014 T20 World Cup in Bangladesh.

His highest international score was 90 which came against Ireland in a T20 International series in March 2017.

Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper Virat Kohli rued the dropped catches by his team after its 59-run drubbing at the hands of Delhi Capitals in the IPL here on Monday.

All-rounder Marcus Stoinis was dropped on 30 by Yuzvendra Chahal, after which he went on to score a 26-ball 53 and power Delhi to 196 for four at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

Kohli himself had dropped KL Rahul twice in RCB’s loss to Kings XI Punjab earlier in the tournament.

“Those important chances in between, we need to grab when the opportunity comes our way, it is not like we are dropping half chances, we are dropping sitters and those things hurt you,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation ceremony.

“We got into the game after the first six and then Stoinis batted really well in the end, we gave him a life, he took the game away from us,” he added.

Delhi were off to a flying start with openers Prithvi Shaw and Shikhar Dhawan adding 68 runs. The RCB bowlers were able to pull things back, picking up quick wickets before slipping again.

“I think they got off to a great start in the first six then we pulled it back in the next eight overs and the last phase again got away from us,” Kohli said.

RCB have won three of their five matches. However, both their losses have come while chasing big targets.

“I think it is about rectifying those small mistakes. The conversation around chasing is always to have a big partnership, with the dew setting in had we kept 7-8 wickets at the end of 10 overs, the game would have been on,” Kohli said.

Our strategy was to be fearless: Shreyas

Delhi Capitals skipper Shreyas Iyer was delighted with his team’s all-round performance.

“Our strategy was to be fearless and play with full freedom. We have got good youngsters in our side, so we just need to go out and execute our talent and skills. I am very happy with the way things are going so far, and we need to keep up the momentum,” Iyer said.

“It is important for us to get a good recovery. It isn’t easy going back into the bio bubble, so we try to spend time with each other and that is working really well for us,” he added.

Axar Patel (2/18), who came in to the side in place of the injured Amit Mishra, played a vital role in his side’s victory and was adjudged the Man of the Match.

“I knew it was stopping on the wicket. I knew I would bowl in the powerplay and I had practised for it as well. I think I executed my plans really well.

“My plan after speaking to batsmen was that since the wicket was slow, I wanted to bowl at the stumps and vary the pace.

“In the powerplay I was in a mood to defend at first, but when the third ball spun I changed gears and got into an attack mode,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jlorpw/article32777550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRAT1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-kohli-rues-dropped-catches-after-59-run-thrashing/article32777551.ece

258,2020/10/06,Coimbatore Corporation speeds up plan approval,"Coimbatore Corporation has put in place a mechanism to speed up the process of approving building plan.

The new arrangement the civic body implemented four days ago will ensure that applicants seeking approval for building plan for houses measuring less than 2,000 sq.ft. will get it within three days.

The Corporation will send the approval by post to the applicants’ house as it did not want them to visit its office, says a source. For those seeking approval for houses over 2,000 sq.ft., the Corporation will send the approval within seven to 10 days.

The Corporation has reversed the decision it took more than a month ago to decentralise the plan approval process by delegating powers to zonal assistant commissioners and assistant town planning officers by empowering them to approve plans for residential buildings measuring up to 2,000 sq.ft.

Henceforth, all the approval process will be only at the main office in Town Hall, says the source. The reversal comes even as the Corporation effected a change in the town planning section by transferring executive engineer R. Sasipriya as the town planning officer.

The Corporation decision comes in the wake of complaints that a few persons acted as touts for getting plan approval and that the applicants were forced to pay in excess of what the Corporation charged. After the complaints, the Corporation had also removed a few contract workers in the town planning wing in all the five zones.

As an extension of the effort to streamline the building plan approval process, the Corporation had also asked the service provider who developed the ‘auto DCR’ software to deliver the updated version in the next 10 days.

And, the Corporation will also issue certificates to those engineers who had applied to be registered engineers for drawing plans – a process that has been pending for around two years, the source adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-corporation-speeds-up-plan-approval/article32776903.ece
259,2020/10/06,Shaheen Bagh protests case | Supreme Court verdict on October 7,"A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul will deliver the judgment.

The Supreme Court will pronounce its judgment on Wednesday on balancing the right to protest against the right to public movement, in the background of the marathon Shaheen Bagh protests against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act.

A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul will deliver the judgment on a petition filed by advocate Amit Sahni several months ago, for a direction to shift the anti-CAA protesters of Shaheen Bagh, mostly mothers and their children, to an alternative site as they were “blocking” public movement and causing traffic snarls in the area.

The protesters were later removed by the police on March 24 with the advent of the pandemic and the resultant national lockdown.

The protesters had at the time written to Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde against their “forcible and vindictive removal” by the Delhi Police.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had argued that the right to protest, like any other right, was not “absolute.” Justice Kaul had orally said the avenue of debate was first the Parliament in a parliamentary democracy. In addition, peaceful protests could be held.

Mr. Sahni had said though the reason for the petition — the blockage of the main road by Shaheen Bagh protestors — had become infructuous, the court should still pass specific orders that protests in future should not hinder public movement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5rahm3/article32068313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-supreme-court-of-india,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shaheen-bagh-protests-case-supreme-court-verdict-on-october-7/article32785908.ece

The CBI has booked Delhi-based Hanung Toys & Textiles Limited (HTTL) and its directors for allegedly cheating a consortium of 12 banks of ₹2,040.63 crore from 2012 to 2014.

As on date, the banks have to recover about ₹4,900 crore from the company, its promoters and guarantors.

Among those named in the FIR are HTTL managing director, Ashok Kumar Bansal; and director, Anju Bansal. Unknown bank officials are also under the scanner. The complaint was filed by the Punjab National Bank on behalf of the consortium.

3 facilities

HTTL has a soft-toy manufacturing facility, a home-furnishing product facility and a textile processing facility in Uttar Pradesh’s Noida and Roorkee in Uttarakhand. It approached the consortium for credit facilities, which was sanctioned.

As alleged, HTTL defaulted on honouring its commitments towards letters of credit and guarantees. Accordingly, restructuring of the account was done in 2014. However, it did not adhere to the terms of reconstruction and the account slipped into the non-performing asset category.

The forensic audit report, received in September 2019, revealed several alleged financial irregularities.

Transactions to the tune of ₹11,257 crore were routed through one Almondz Impex Private Limited. However, its office was not found at the given address. The Corporate Affairs Ministry website revealed that the firm was set up in February 2013 but had not filed any balance-sheet. Its name has now been struck off by the Ministry.

Usher Agro Limited, a vendor of Hanung Toys that deals in agro products, had been declared a fraud by banks, said the FIR.

The audit detected that payments on account of exports were not realised, and for imports, the banks had to make payments under the letters of credit arrangement, it is alleged.

“Non-realisation of proceeds is deviation of merchant trade, also it is not possible that all of a sudden all buyers stop making payment,” said the FIR, adding that the company undertook transactions with the parties that were not in the line of its business. Besides, a mismatch in figures suggested that the books of accounts were forged.

The accused company transacted with international firms that were not in the business of soft toys and textiles, which raised suspicion.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r83uf7/article31686744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-stock-cbi-investigation,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cbi-books-delhi-firm-for-204063-crore-bank-fraud/article32785025.ece

262,2020/10/06,"‘Bio-decomposer’ spraying to check stubble burning in Delhi, says Kejriwal","The solution, when sprayed in the fields, can decompose crop residue and turn it into manure, he said.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday that the Delhi government will start spraying “Pusa bio-decomposer” solution from October 11 to prevent stubble burning in non-basmati rice fields in the national capital.

Scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, PUSA, have found a low-cost, simple and effective way to deal with the problem of stubble burning, he said.

“They have developed ‘bio-decomposer’ capsules, which are used to prepare a liquid formulation. The solution, when sprayed in the fields, can decompose crop residue and turn it into manure,” Mr. Kejriwal said after inspecting his government’s centralized bio-decomposer system set up in Kharkhari Nahar village in southwest Delhi.

The solution increases soil fertility and reduces the use of fertilisers, he said.

This year, the Delhi government is going to use the solution on the land where non-basmati rice is grown.

“We have estimated that only ₹20 lakh is needed to manage stubble in 700 hectares of agricultural land in Delhi through this solution. It includes the cost of preparation, transportation and spraying,” he said.

Farmers have to just give their consent and the Delhi government will spray the solution in their fields free of cost, he said.

The first batch of solution will be ready in seven days and the spraying will begin on October 11, the Chief Minister said.

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said: “We want to create a model in Delhi so that no government can make an excuse (on the issue of stubble burning).”",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/x2q773/article32777995.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/de05CM-LeadARGR47R1ROM4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bio-decomposer-spraying-to-check-stubble-burning-in-delhi-says-kejriwal/article32781838.ece
263,2020/10/06,Ban crackers for 5 months: citizens to EPCA,"They fear a rise in pollution levels ahead of festive season because of the pandemic

The Citizens For Clean Air — a group of citizens, environmentalists, waste management experts, scientists, medical practitioners and several RWA representatives — has written to the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA), seeking a ban on the sale and use of firecrackers for five months starting mid-October.

They fear a rise in pollution levels, which could aggravate the situation arising out of the pandemic.

In a letter to EPCA chairman Bhure Lal, the group said winter months recorded high levels of pollution and “these dangerous levels of pollution will be repeated this year too and the ongoing pandemic will only make the situation graver.”

‘Treat as emergency’

They demanded that EPCA treat this as an impending health emergency and intervene to ban and issue required advisories on the sale and use of firecrackers during the pandemic period from 15 October, 2020 to 15 March, 2021.

The letter pointed out that these five months were the time for festivals, marriages, sport and other public events and firecrackers were one of the main contributors to the pollution.

The letter, written by waste management activist Ruchika Sethi, also running — Why Waste Your Waste — campaign, also referred to media reports suggesting that a marginal increase in pollution levels could lead to an increase in COVID-19 deaths.

Study on COVID-19

“Also, a study published by Harvard University found that even a minor increase in PM 2.5 particles can lead to an increase in COVID-19 deaths,” read the letter.

“We have enough anecdotal evidence of children, adults with underlying respiratory diseases and senior citizens experiencing difficulty in breathing resulting in increased hospital visits. Many residents were restricted to their homes. There are also enough newspaper reports and studies done on the dangers of firecracker emissions,” said the missive, arguing that increased visits to hospitals, due to respiratory emergencies arising out of toxic particles in our breathing zone, during COVID-19 times, were fraught with its own dangers. Meanwhile, average PM 2.5 reading of 110 micrograms per cubic meter was recorded at the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station at Vikas Sadan here on October 3. The PM 2.5 levels reached a maximum of 400 around 10 a.m. and dropped to a minimum of 61 around 4 p.m.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ban-crackers-for-5-months-citizens-to-epca/article32780237.ece
264,2020/10/06,Snatcher kills 24-year-old civil defence volunteer in Delhi,"Accused flees spot with phone, on the run

A 24-year-old civil defence volunteer was stabbed to death and his friend was injured allegedly by two persons while trying to resist a snatching bid at GB road in Central Delhi, the police said on Monday.

The incident happened at 11.30 p.m. on Sunday when the victim, Aman from Noida, along with his friends — Aniruddh, Hari Om and Raju — went to GB Road for some work. A person suddenly tried to snatch Aman’s mobile phone but failed as the group caught him.

The men started beating the snatcher when the latter’s accomplice came to the spot and stabbed Aman. He also attacked Aniruddh, the officer said, adding that the accused fled the spot with the phone.

Both men were rushed to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital where Aman was declared brought dead by doctors while Aniruddh is undergoing treatment. “We received information at 1.54 a.m. from RML Hospital,” said DCP (Central) Sanjay Bhatia. A case was registered under Sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), 397(robbery or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) at Kamla Market police station and probe is under way, he added.

“Aman’s younger sister's marriage was scheduled on November 11. He was preparing for it. He was our only son.

265,2020/10/06,Kejriwal announces anti-pollution campaign ahead of winter,"Kejriwal to launch Green Delhi app soon, implement hotspot-specific action plans

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced an anti-pollution campaign — Yuddh Pradushan Ke Virudh — to reduce air pollution levels in Delhi for the upcoming winter season.

Mr. Kejriwal said various measures to combat pollution such as the launching of the Green Delhi app, creation of a war room to monitor steps on a real-time basis, processing liquid solution for farm fields to prevent stubble burning, implementing hotspot-specific action plans would be a part of the campaign.

“Every year, the level of pollution rises in October, November, and December here. One of the biggest reasons for this is burning of crop stubble. This year, air pollution can be deadly because of COVID-19,” he said at a digital briefing.

“In the last five years, the people of Delhi have done commendable work to control levels of pollution. In Delhi, the pollution levels have actually decreased between 2014-2019. The average PM2.5 in 2014 was 154, and PM2.5 in 2018-19 was 115,” he added.

Following a meeting with government departments and agencies earlier during the day, Mr. Kejriwal said the government would be declaring a war against pollution. The foremost aspect of this campaign, he said, would require dealing with the pollution due to crop stubble burning every year. The Pusa Agricultural Research Institute had devised a fermented liquid solution to be sprayed on the fields to soften the stubble and prevent its burning, which Delhi would use.

‘Heavy fines’

“We are also launching an intensive anti-dust drive from today [Monday] under which various action plans will be implemented. Our inspection teams will visit the construction sites across Delhi and impose heavy fines if they are found not following anti-pollution measures in construction sites,” he said.

He said mechanical sweepers would be used by civic bodies across Delhi to ensure no pollution due to road dust. He said he had also instructed agencies to repair potholes. Anti-smog guns had also been installed across the city to reduce the impact of pollution.

There are 13 points in Delhi where the impact of pollution is the maximum; those areas have been identified and the government has done detailed planning for each of the hotspots. “We will also be launching the Green Delhi App this month,” he said.

“We are also creating a war room against pollution for monitoring of various measures that are implemented and have to be implemented in the coming days. I will get the daily report of the frequency, impact and success of these activities. We are also drafting the tree transplantation policy,” he said.

“Delhi has shut down its own two plants,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/envyxk/article32701639.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KEJRIWAL-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-announces-anti-pollution-campaign-ahead-of-winter/article32779832.ece
266,2020/10/06,"CAA, stirs gave rise to hate speeches before riots: report","Provocative speeches on social media led to environment of violence, says report released by Citizens and Lawyers Initiative.

An environment for violence was created before the riots broke out in the Capital in February, a recent report released by Citizens and Lawyers Initiative has stated.

The report, titled ‘Delhi Riots of February 2020: Causes, Fallout and Aftermath’, claims that the implementation of Citizenship Amendment Act and the protests that followed gave rise to hate speeches, “which stoked the flames of communal violence”.

‘Kapil Mishra’s speech’

“This culminated in the communally charged Delhi election campaign, which was eventually won by the Aam Aadmi Party without challenging the vitriolic content of its main Opposition. This gave rise to well-publicised gun-wielding vigilantes. The environment was as charged as a powder keg that just needed a spark to erupt. Kapil Mishra’s provocative speech in Jaffrabad, and the incendiary Facebook Live posts by Ragini Tiwari aka Janki Behen, appear to have had that effect; bolstered by rumour and misinformation on social media,” the report stated.

According to the report, “ambiguous” role of police, inaction, “selective” complicity with Hindu rioters, and other factors lead to the escalation. The report also stated that the violence had multiple aspects, including the strategic deployment of rampaging mobs, local vigilantism and social media playing a role in coordinating and mobilising attacks and spreading misinformation to incite.

“The failure of the law and order situation arose as a result of reported incidents of police partaking in the violence, providing tacit support to Hindu mobs, and failing to take appropriate action to staunch the loss of lives, livelihoods, and properties,” the report read.

Talking about the compensation offered by the government, the report stated that it was less than what was offered during the Muzaffarnagar riots and there were also gaps in what was promised and what was delivered.

Mentioning “political parallelism” in the investigation, the report claimed that the police put forward the narrative of the ruling party and that they chose to base their ‘analysis’ of the event on selective aspects of the witness statements “that conform to their existing narrative”.

The report recommended the formation of a multi-stakeholder accountability team to supervise the investigation, institute adequate rehabilitation package, publish an account of compensation promises and disbursed, conduct trust drives.

Former Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna, who presided over the Commission of Inquiry into 1992-93 Bombay riots, who has written the prologue of the report, said: “It is time that the State machinery and constitutional functionaries display greater seriousness in the investigation of the causes of such riots and take appropriate steps to prevent their recurrence”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/3h5vz8/article32779604.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE05RIOTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/caa-stirs-gave-rise-to-hate-speeches-before-riots-report/article32779605.ece
267,2020/10/06,Audit team to investigateWaqf Board ‘irregularities’,"Amanatullah Khan’s tenure under scanner

The Delhi government has launched a special audit into alleged irregularities by former Delhi Waqf Board chairman Amanatullah Khan during his tenure.

According to a written communication in this regard from the Minority Cell of the Revenue Department to the Chief Executive Officer of the Delhi Waqf Board, a four-member team is auditing records related to Mr. Khan’s tenure as chairman of the Board from March 2016 to March 2020.

“The special audit is concerned with the irregularities committed by Amanatullah Khan in the capacity of the Delhi Waqf Board chairman, with effect from March 2016 to March 2020,” the letter, dated September 21, stated.

The AAP Okhla MLA was unanimously elected as Waqf Board member again but his election is yet to be notified by the Delhi government.

He was the chairman of the Board before the Delhi Assembly elections earlier this year when his term as a member of the Board expired.

The letter from the office of Principal Secretary (Revenue) directed the Delhi Waqf Board to provide “all concerned auditable records and information as per scope and period of audit” to the audit team.

Mr. Khan previously served as the chairman of the Board for around six months in 2016 before resigning in May, and again from September 2018 to March 2020.

A CBI enquiry is already pending against him in connection with the appointments made by him in the Waqf Board during his earlier tenure in 2016. The Delhi government’s Anti Corruption Branch (ACB) too had registered a case against him for alleged misuse of funds before the Delhi Assembly polls.

“The team has started work and it is being provided all the help and information,” said a senior Delhi government official.

With his election as a member of the Delhi Waqf Board, according to sources, Mr. Khan is likely to return as chairman of the panel for the third time in a row despite the audit.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/audit-team-toprobe-delhiwaqf-boardirregularities/article32777295.ece

The forthcoming Regional Plan with 20-year horizon of 2041 would be challenging and also a unique opportunity to plan for a better future, said Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep S. Puri on Monday, speaking at the 39th meeting of the NCR Planning Board.

Mr. Puri said the NCR area and population had grown gradually and the forthcoming Regional Plan with 20-year horizon of 2041 would, therefore, be very challenging. “It will also be a unique opportunity for all of us to plan for a better future 2041. Presently, NCRPB Secretariat is engaged in preparation of Regional Plan-2041 as the perspective year of current Regional Plan-2021 is approaching. Planning for a vast and diverse NCR can be achieved only through an inclusive, consultative exercise with active participation of all stakeholders. I am happy to note that a comprehensive consultative exercise of 17 full-day workshops was undertaken by the NCRPB,” said Mr. Puri.

The NCR has grown gradually from about 30,242 sqkm in 1989 to 34,144 sq km in 2005 to about 55, 083 sq km at present, with a core of Delhi area being about 1,483 sqkm. The NCR population as per the 2011 census is about 5.81 crore, which is likely to rapidly increase making NCR-Delhi the biggest and the most populous capital region globally by 2030.

Haryana CM Manohar Lal; Urban Development Ministers from Delhi, U.P. and Rajasthan; Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Secretary, Durga Shanker Mishra and other representatives were present.

Cost of projects

The Minister said that the cumulative projects sanctioned so far by the NCR Planning Board were 366, out of which 269 were completed and 97 were under various stages of implementation. The estimated cost of these 366 projects was ₹31,853 crore, out of which ₹15,393 crore was sanctioned by the Board and ₹12,441 crore released so far.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/regional-plan-2041-a-chance-to-plan-better-future-says-puri/article32777284.ece
269,2020/10/06,NGT pulls up Haryana over environment norm violations,"Housing project flouted rules: petition

Following a plea alleging violation of environmental norms by a housing project in Faridabad, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has pulled up the Haryana government over “repeated serious violations” and directed the Chief Secretary to convene a meeting with authorities concerned and take appropriate action.

A Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, “To uphold the rule of law and for protection of environment and public health, the State authorities must take further appropriate action which may be monitored by the Chief Secretary, Haryana, by calling the meeting of statutory authorities concerned within a month.”

“This step has become necessary in view of repeated serious violations of the environmental norms by housing projects in the state of Haryana,” the Bench observed.

The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by Mukund Dhote against a housing project, ‘Vesta Heights’, in Faridabad. The plea had contended that the project was in violation of the conditions specified in environmental clearance.

A report submitted by a committee comprising officials from the Union Environment Ministry, State Pollution Control Board and Central Pollution Control Board said that a compensation of ₹12.02 crore had been assessed.

Noting that the compensation had not been recovered yet, the Bench observed, “The report does not show adequate action for compliance of environmental norms. The amount of compensation has not yet been recovered nor coercive measures taken, not even order of blacklisting, even though the State Pollution Control Board had written to Director, Town and Country Planning Department.”

“It would be better if instead of doing petty politics, Durgesh Pathak puts pressure on the Delhi government to release municipal funds,” Mr. Kapoor said.

However, there is an increase in fire count in Punjab and Haryana and the air quality is likely to deteriorate later this week.

Delhi’s overall AQI on Monday was 179, which was slightly less than Sunday’s 184, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

However, boundary layer wind direction is favourable for transport of the effect of stubble burning to Delhi and as the ventilation coefficient (VC) decreases, stubble burning will impact Delhi in the coming days. According to SAFAR officials, the air quality of Delhi is likely to turn poor later this week.

VC is the product of mixing height (the height of the atmosphere up to which pollutants can be dispersed) and average wind speed. So, a higher VC means that mixing height and wind speed are high and this aids in the better dispersion of pollutants and hence reduces air pollution.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aqi-likely-to-be-moderate-for-next-two-days/article32777114.ece

“AAP demands that the BJP-ruled civic bodies must release the fund for these warriors and follow the court order. We also demand that the BJP should immediately stop the injustice towards these people,” said AAP leader Durgesh Pathak while addressing a press conference.

City-based AIG Hospitals and Satisfai Health Inc, Canada, on Tuesday announced a collaboration to transform gastroenterology and gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy with artificial intelligence (AI).

Under this, Satisfai Health has signed a data licensing and partnership agreement with AIG Hospitals to help drive its mission of becoming the global leader in providing AI solutions in gastroenterology and GI endoscopy.

Chairman and managing director of AIG Hospitals, D. Nageshwar Reddy said the most important area where AI is applied is colonic polyps and colonic cancer. He said early detection and removal of polyps can prevent cancers.

Detecting polyps

Polyps “With AI, we can not only diagnose more polyps missed by human eye but can characterise these polyps into those which are dangerous and which aren’t. Dangerous polyps can be removed to avoid cancer from occurring. We can actually prevent cancers in large sections of population using AI,” Dr Nageshwar said during a virtual press conference on Tuesday.

Endoscopy procedures

He added that their hospitals performs around 700 different types of endoscopy procedures a day. The big data will be fed into AI systems to produce intelligent systems which can then diagnose and help in early treatment.

CEO and founder of Satisfai Health, Michael Byrne said, “This partnership will dramatically increase our data pipeline and access to very high quality endoscopic and clinical data for our work in AI applications. This agreement solidifies our collaboration with THE clinical innovators and thought leaders at AIG.”

Explaining medical application of AI, Rakesh Kalapala, director of Endoscopy at AIG, said that a medical condition can be diagnosed using artificial neural networks.

281,2020/10/06,First of season’s three ‘low key’ tsunami mock drills held,"East coast of India and Andaman & Nicobar will take part in round 2, west coast in round 3

The first of three proposed Indian Ocean wide tsunami exercises was taken up by the Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre (ITEWC) at the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) here on Tuesday, by simulating an earthquake followed by issuance of warning bulletins to 23 countries.

India, along with several other Indian Ocean nations, is participating in the exercises codenamed ‘IOWave20’ where the communication channels are being tested instead of a full scale operation because of the physical distancing measures in place due to COVID-19. Hence, there is also no community engagement whatsoever, informed INCOIS director T. Srinivasa Kumar.

Countries across the Indian Ocean and their respective disaster management organisations have been advised to test their communication protocols and conduct a “virtual” tabletop exercise as a minimum to assess organisational standard operating procedures (SOPs), plans and policies for tsunami warning and emergency response.

IOWave20 exercise comprises three scenarios — the first one on Tuesday simulated an earthquake with 9.1 magnitude in Java region, Indonesia, at 8 a.m.; the second one on October 13 will simulate an earthquake with 9.2 magnitude in Andaman Trench of India at 9.30 a.m.; and the third one on October 20 will simulate an earthquake with 9.0 magnitude in the Makran Trench off-coast of Pakistan at 11.30 a.m.

The director informed all the scenarios will be limited to an hour, during which time ITEWC will issue four tsunami bulletins to both national and regional stakeholders through global telecommunications systems, e-mail, fax, SMS as well as on website. The exercise is being organised by the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, UNESCO.

INCOIS has coordinated the exercise in close association with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) with the participation of all disaster management organisations of coastal States/Union Territories, Navy, Coast Guard, NDRF, critical installations and port and harbours. Entire east coast of India and Andaman & Nicobar Islands will participate in the second exercise and west coast of India and Lakshadweep Islands will participate in the third one.

A webinar was held last month to finalise the SOPs for the ongoing exercise in which more than 150 officials from the 23 countries, including 46 officials from within the country drawn from various wings, had participated. A manual comprising information on tsunami exercise, detailed bulletins and feedback forms is also being prepared and circulated to the stakeholders. Feedback from the participants after the exercise is expected to identify and fix any gaps in communication channels and the SOPs of stakeholders, the director added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/first-of-seasons-three-low-key-tsunami-mock-drills-held/article32786118.ece

285,2020/10/06,TS mulls new lift scheme at Srisailam,"It’s time AP changed its high-handed attitude to illegally divert Krishna water: KCR

Toughening its stand in the matter of getting judicious share in the Krishna river waters, Telangana government on Tuesday made it clear that it would lift 3 tmcft water every day from the foreshores of Srisailam reservoir with a barrage between Alampur and Pedda Marur in case Andhra Pradesh failed to stop its illegal projects to divert Krishna water.

In a statement issued after after the apex council meeting, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said it was time AP changed its high-handed attitude to illegally divert Krishna water from Srisailam reservoir with a new lift scheme and by expanding the Pothireddypadu head regulator water drawal system. He pointed out AP had acted against the interests of Telangana region during the combined dispensation, but it would not be allowed now.

He condemned AP’s plans to divert huge quantity of water from Srisailam reservoir without having any allocation and ayacut. He said the Telangana society had been opposing Pothireddypadu, which was actually planned with a capacity to draw 1,500 cusecs but the high-handed attitude of AP leadership had made the then government to construct it with 11,150 cusecs capacity and later enhanced by another 44,000 cusecs, all along the movement for statehood. Now, AP plans to increase it to 80,000 cusecs, he noted.

Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao brought to the notice of the apex council how Telangana government had written to the Centre immediately after formation of the State, on July 14, 2014, seeking to constitute a new tribunal for sharing of river waters against under the provisions of Section 3 of the Inter State River Water Disputes Act, 1956. However, the Centre had not acted for over a year on its plea and later the State moved the Supreme Court for justice.

“Telangana has no objection to withdraw its case in the Supreme Court if the Centre assures to constitute a new tribunal or give new terms of reference to the existing Brijesh Kumar Tribunal to take up allocation of water afresh,” the Chief Minister said in the virtual meeting. He hoped that allocation of water to Telangana both in Krishna and Godavari rivers would go up if the matter was referred to a tribunal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cknxm1/article32785817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy06CM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ts-mulls-new-lift-scheme-at-srisailam/article32785818.ece
286,2020/10/06,"Centre agrees to refer TS, AP Krishna water issue to tribunal","Ministry of Jal Shakti asks Telangana to withdraw case pending in Supreme Court

In a major decision, the Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS) has agreed to look into the request of Telangana to refer the matter of deciding the share of water in the Krishna River between it and Andhra Pradesh afresh under Section 3 of the Inter State River Water Disputes Act, provided Telangana withdraws its case pending in the Supreme Court.

The Centre has also agreed to consider the two States’ request to finalise the water shares in the Godavari river too. The two States have agreed to send the proposals seeking a fresh tribunal to decide the water share. As per the Inter State River Disputes Act, the Centre is empowered to take a decision handing over the matter to a tribunal even if one riparian States asks for it, within a year after getting the proposal/request.

“Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has agreed to withdraw the case filed by the State in the apex court when we (MoJS) pointed that the Ministry can’t take decision on referring the matter to a tribunal as the matter is sub-judice. Accordingly, Mr. Rao has agreed to put in motion the case withdrawal process from tomorrow (Wednesday) itself to enable the Centre to take the matter of referring water shares to a tribunal,” Minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said after the meeting on Tuesday.

Once the Ministry receives the written commitment of Telangana that it would withdraw the case pending in the Supreme Court, the Centre would first take legal opinion on whether the matter of deciding the water share between the two States could be given to the existing Brijesh Kumar Tribunal or to constitute a new tribunal for the purpose, the Union Minister said, speaking after the meeting.

Although the Brijesh Kumar Tribunal had submitted its report on the allotment of water among the riparian States Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, it is yet to come into force as AP moved the Supreme Court as it was not satisfied with the allocation of water made by the tribunal without any provision of distress sharing mechanism. Later, after AP was bifurcated into AP and Telangana in 2014, the new State too moved the Supreme Court seeking higher allotment of water highlighting the injustices heaped on it from the beginning.

The Centre’s decision to consider constituting a new tribunal on Godavari water also assumes significance with AP’s objection to several projects taken up by Telangana in the basin although several of them were taken up during the combined State itself. The projects have been redesigned to suit the needs of Telangana and the location of head works of some projects were merged in AP a few months after bifurcation of the combined State.

“It’s going to be a win-win situation for Telangana as there is historical evidence of the region’s neglect in the allotment of water in the two river basins besides having more than double the catchment area compared to AP both in case of Godavari and Krishna rivers,” hoped a senior official of the Irrigation Department.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fmtgo5/article32785763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy07apex2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/centre-agrees-to-refer-ts-ap-krishna-water-issue-to-tribunal/article32785764.ece

290,2020/10/06,‘Vidya Volunteers’ hold offline classes for the less privileged,"GMR Varalakshmi Foundation’s ‘Study Circle’ ensures academics of govt. school students continue uninterrupted

GMR Varalakshmi Foundation (GMRVF), which has been conducting online lessons for class X students of government schools in villages around the city airport due to the COVID-induced closure of educational institutions, has now decided on an offline programme to reach out to students of classes 1-8 too.

This offline mode has been taken up through the ‘Study Circle’ programme where a group of ‘Vidya Volunteers’ are trained to give focused assistance to students in need. The volunteers are also empowered to pick up bright senior students from the same schools to teach their juniors, said an official spokesman.

The foundation partnered with ConveGenius (CG), a Delhi-based tech startup, to implement online classes for class X students in August. Those classes have helped shortlist about 100 students of the Zilla Parishad Girls’ High School, Shamshabad; Zilla Parishad Boys’ High School, Shamshabad and Zilla Parishad High School, Mamidipally.

The firm has developed an app for students to track their progress using online learning tools. “The new way of learning through CG slate app has helped us correct ourselves. Vidya volunteers are also very helpful in clearing our doubts,” says R. Mahalakshmi, a class 10 student of Mamidipally high school.

A class 8 student from ZPHS Shamshabad K. Yagnesh says, “The study circle has come as a boon. We are able to continue our studies though schools have not opened yet”. Study circles have enrolled 110 students of classes 1 to 8 belonging to four government primary schools, one each in Airport Colony, Gollapally, Mamidipally and Shamshabad.

Classes are conducted offline where a senior student volunteer mentors four children in the neighbourhood in mathematics, science, English and other subjects. “GMRVF staff monitor the classes fortnightly, provide feedback and advice for improvement. Each volunteer is trained to follow safety measures,” the spokesman explained.

Specially designed workbooks are distributed to students with assessments done verbally on a weekly basis. Earlier, GMRVF introduced customised online training classes for unemployed youth for vocations like false ceiling, refrigeration and AC, automobiles and 2-wheeler repair, electrical house wiring, hotel management, computers. etc. “With online and study circle classes, we are able to provide the students a level-playing field.

291,2020/10/06,COVID-19 | Survivors told to watch out for blurred vision,"Critically-ill patients who were administered steroids can be at risk of developing ocular complications

Retina and cornea consultants have urged people to watch out for eye-related complications after recovering from COVID-19.

Specialists from L.V. Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI) said that critically-ill COVID patients who were administered steroids to mitigate complications in lung and other organs can be at risk of developing steroid related ocular complications.

Not all those who have recovered from COVID-19 need a mandatory detailed eye examination. It is suggested for those who experience blurring of eyesight or similar symptoms after recovering from the infectious disease.

Complications likely

The specialists said that COVID-19 may cause obstruction of blood supply to the retina. One of these is an eye complication called ‘retinopathy’, which is a kind of a retinal vascular disease where the retina gets damaged because of abnormal blood flow, resulting in vision impairment.

“Retinopathy due to COVID or steroid treatment usually occurs within two to four weeks after COVID has resolved. So, patients who have recovered from COVID and had been treated with steroids should watch out for such symptoms for the initial weeks or till the time they are on steroids for lung complications. The most common symptom is blurring of vision (not necessarily accompanied by redness or pain). We are seeing patients with retinopathy, either due to block of the retinal blood vessel or swelling of the retina. But the good news is that, so far, based on the cases reported to us, the risk to develop this condition is less than 0.1%,” said Raja Narayanan, senior retina consultant at LVPEI.

A senior cornea consultant at the premier eye institute, Sunita Chaurasia said that steroids administered to treat elderly COVID-19 patients can lead to a relative immune-deficient stage and hence there is also a risk of developing certain viral conditions such as herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

Redness, discharge

“This is a condition that presents with skin eruptions and excoriations involving the eyelid and the surrounding area, along with secondary conjunctivitis-like symptoms such as redness and discharge. The condition can be associated with pain or tingling sensation in and around the eyes,” she said, adding that maintaining good eye health practices, being vigilant, and consulting doctors immediately on experiencing any vision-related complications is very important.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/wfshm2/article32776878.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY05-LVPEI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/covid-19-survivors-told-to-watch-out-for-blurred-vision/article32776872.ece

Ta Dhom by Viveick Rajagopalan feat. Swadesi

Indian Classical rhythm is absolutely breathtaking by itself. The Ta Dhom Project moves it outside its conventional domain in this single, and magic is created. This project is sheer brilliance combining rap and konnakol.

Te Misea (A Scream To Save The Planet) by Richard Bona

A delightful tune with graceful scale shifts embedded on a beautiful 6/8 time signature. Being a percussionist, I’ve always wondered how Richard Bona felt and experienced different rhythms. His compositions take you on a special emotional journey.

The Way Up: Opening and Part one by Pat Metheny Group

Thirty-one minutes of intense jazz music indulgence. You can either just close your eyes and be transported to another world or grab your sheets to decode the chords and cross rhythms. This piece has something for everyone who wants to sink into a deep listening experience.

This piece makes you truly believe that the guitar, violin, ghatam, tabla and the moharsing belong to the same genre of music. This is the definition of free genre-transcending music.

Almoraima by Paco de Lucía

If you want to be stunned by the percussive possibilities of a guitar, this track can be a great starting point. Flamenco music, as such, has complex rhythms, but Paco de Lucía was a very special artiste who did superhuman things with the guitar.

Instead of letting negative emotions take over, she puts on her motorcycle gear to ride on an open road. With the wind on her face, she explores a new station, meeting and helping strangers. She takes time for herself, relaxes and does things she enjoys the most and feels rejuvenated.

That idea couldn’t take off and the team was busy with other projects. Then Rajeev Raj got on board last year and arranged, composed and produced a tune to words written by Sriman.

The music video was shot for four days in Secunderabad, Vikarabad and Ananthagiri Hills and Penguin Resorts (near Sarpanpally lake, Vikarabad) in 2019. Explaining how the song was recorded during the lockdown, Venkat says, “The entertainment industry was completely shut due to the pandemic, but music composer Rajeev Raj, singer Shakthisree Gopalan and lyricist and director Sriman Keerthi connected virtually to take things forward. The audio was produced virtually.”

295,2020/10/06,Led Zeppelin emerges victor in 'Stairway to Heaven' plagiarism case,"Lead singer Robert Plant and guitarist Jimmy Page had been accused in the six-year long case of lifting the riff - one of the best-known openings in rock music - from a song called “Taurus”, written by the late Randy Wolfe of the U.S. band Spirit.

British rock band Led Zeppelin on Monday effectively won a long-running legal battle over claims it stole the opening guitar riff from its signature 1971 song “Stairway to Heaven.”

The band, one of the best-selling rock acts of all time, was handed victory after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the case, meaning that a March 2020 decision by a U.S. appeals court in Led Zeppelin's favor will stand.

Lead singer Robert Plant and guitarist Jimmy Page had been accused in the six-year long case of lifting the riff - one of the best-known openings in rock music - from a song called “Taurus”, written by the late Randy Wolfe of the U.S. band Spirit.

Wolfe, who performed as Randy California, drowned in 1997, and the case was brought by a trustee for his estate. It has been one of the music industry's most closely watched copyright cases, potentially exposing Plant and Page to millions of dollars in damages.

Led Zeppelin was the opening act for Spirit on a U.S. tour in 1968, but Page testified in a 2016 jury trial in Los Angeles that he had not heard “Taurus” until recently.

The Los Angeles jury found the riff they were accused of stealing was not intrinsically similar to the opening chords of ”Stairway to Heaven.”

Francis Malofiy, who represented Wolfe's estate, said on Monday that Led Zeppelin “won on a technicality” and said that the lawsuit had accomplished its goal.

“Today, the world knows that: 1) Randy California wrote the introduction to 'Stairway to Heaven'; 2) Led Zeppelin are the greatest art thieves of all time; and 3) Courts are as imperfect as rock stars,” Malofiy said in a statement.

Led Zeppelin has yet to comment on the conclusion of the case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/wjiqn1/article32778209.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUSIC-LEDZEPPELIN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/led-zeppelin-emerges-victor-in-stairway-to-heaven-plagiarism-case/article32778210.ece
296,2020/10/06,‘Heritage railway stations in district underutilised’,"Passenger train service to Harbour Terminus yet to resume

While welcoming the ongoing feasibility study of the integrated coaching terminal (ICT) proposed in the Ponnurunni-Kathrikadavu area, the Ernakulam Old Railway Station Vikasana Samiti, that has been spearheading the agitation to renovate the Old Railway Station located behind the High Court, has expressed concern over the Southern Railway “losing sight” of the potential of the 42-acre premises to decongest Ernakulam Junction and Town railway stations.

The Southern Railway spent ₹1.5 crore to replace worn-out tracks on the 1.3-km-long stretch that links the station with the main line. Kerala Rail Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) had accorded second priority to the project over a year ago, said K.P. Harihara Kumar, general convenor of the Samiti.

On October 2, the Samiti organised a function on the station premises to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 151st birth anniversary. Gandhi had alighted at the station on his way to participate in the Vaikom Satyagraha.

Harbour Terminus

Mr. Kumar said the Railway must optimally use huge tracts of vacant land at the renovated Harbour Terminus station, which was constructed during the British era. Passenger train services have not resumed to the station, although a new bridge has been built parallel to the Venduruthy railway overbridge. Trains to Shoranur, Guruvayur and Kottayam must begin service from there. The Southern Railway, KRDCL and the State government must intervene proactively to make optimal use of the two heritage stations, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pi2tfx/article32777438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05KI-OLDSTATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/heritage-railway-stations-in-district-underutilised/article32777439.ece
297,2020/10/06,KRDCL report on integrated coaching terminal in Kochi by December,"The proposed project site has space to host trains on a dozen platforms; terminal could decongest Ernakulam Junction and Town stations

The integrated coaching terminal (ICT) proposed on 110 acres of land in the Ponnurunni-Kathrikadavu area is likely to get a shot in the arm, with Kerala Rail Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) expected to submit a feasibility report to Southern Railway by December.

The underutilised space in the heart of the city has the potential to host trains on a dozen platforms, apart from having space for repair and maintenance of trains.

‘Biggest railway hub’

“We took up the feasibility study on a request from the Southern Railway. A survey and study are on to garner details like passenger footfall. This could become the biggest railway hub in Kerala, if all goes well.

“It could become a new halt station for trains through Kottayam and a terminal point for new trains that are allotted to Kerala,” said KRDCL sources.

The integrated terminal could also be linked to the Vyttila Mobility Hub located nearby. It would considerably decongest Ernakulam Junction railway station that has only six platforms and Ernakulam Town station that has just two platforms.

The State government and the Railway would bear the cost of the detailed project report (DPR).

Land acquisition

Minimal land acquisition might be needed for a 100-m road linking the premises with the Thammanam-Pullepady Road, which was slated to be widened to four lanes, they added.

The Southern Railway entrusted KRDCL with the integrated terminal’s feasibility study, after Hibi Eden, Ernakulam MP, took up the issue with the Chairman of the Railway Board.

He had earlier met the Union Railway Minister to apprise him of the potential that the terminal held to speed up train movement through central Kerala since trains would not have to wait in the city’s suburbs for want of vacant platforms at the two main railway stations.

PPP model

“A city-based architectural firm had readied a draft design of the terminal, which showed that at least 12 platforms could be constructed on the premises. The Railway would not have to spend any money if the project is executed on the PPP (public-private partnership) model, with the land given on long-term lease, since its land is already available and underutilised.

“The Railway could use the entire ground floor and the terminal premises, while commercial space, including office space for rent, can be developed on the upper floors,” said Mr. Eden.

A station much bigger than Ernakulam Junction and other amenities can be built here, on land which at present houses only the Railway coaching depot and marshalling yard.

A senior Railway official said private participation could take the project forward.

The Railway will encounter numerous procedural and other issues if it were to implement the project. The existing tracks on the premises must be redone, while the dilapidated Railway quarters could be relocated. Space to repair trains could be earmarked within the premises or the facility shifted to the huge vacant space that the Railway owns on Willingdon Island, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/qjz6l2/article32777427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05KI-RAILLAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/krdcl-report-on-integrated-coaching-terminal-in-kochi-by-december/article32777428.ece

299,2020/10/06,Ruptured lung repaired through emergency surgery,"Patient had recovered from COVID-19 only days earlier

With a chest tube inserted into his lungs, 20-year-old Arjun P. made a harrowing journey from Jalore in Rajasthan to Ahmedabad, Palakkad, Kozhikode, and Kochi, where finally he underwent a surgery for a ruptured lung, which was further delayed and complicated when he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

After a pneumothorax or a collapsed lung that left him breathless in August, Arjun and his parents travelled by road to Ahmedabad, seven hours away.

At the airport in Ahmedabad, from where they intended to fly to Kerala, Arjun was initially barred from flying with the chest tube inserted to decompress the air that had ruptured his lung.

After a 24-hour ordeal and a medical certificate from his doctor, he was allowed to fly.

They arrived in Palakkad first, to be with family and get tested for the virus, before they proceeded for treatment.

‘Lost all hope’

Arjun tested positive, at which point he lost all hope, he said. A COVID-19 ward in a hospital in Palakkad where he saw people succumbing to the disease left him shattered and apprehensive about being able to fight both conditions.

All this while he remained acutely aware that he needed surgery for his lung, a procedure that was delayed till he tested negative. Even when he did test negative, doctors in Kozhikode were apprehensive about doing a surgery on him till he had regained some strength, said Arjun, who is studying in Ahmedabad to be a clinical pharmacist.

He remained asymptomatic, but had developed an infection from the chest tube that had stayed inside for a long time, he said.

Key-hole surgery

Dr. Nasser Yusuf, thoracic surgeon at Sunrise Hospital, Kakkanad, who had treated Arjun for a similar condition in his other lung three years ago, performed an emergency key-hole surgery in September, just a few days after Arjun tested negative for COVID-19.

“He had bronchopleural fistula or a hole in the lung, and empyema thoracis or pus in the chest. He was in severe pain and his condition was deteriorating. Normally, we would have waited for a longer period before we did a surgery, but the only option was to operate and save him. It was a long shot, but we had to take the risk,” Dr. Yusuf said.

Complication avoided

“In a COVID-19 patient, pulmonary fibrosis or even pneumonia-like changes can set in and that would have been a dreadful condition. We could avoid that complication,” he said. The pus in his chest cavity was drained and the hole in his lung was repaired.

Arjun is now with his family in Palakkad and recovering before they can go back to Jalore.

Even a walk across the airport was a painful affair a little more than a month ago, but he thanks Dr. Yusuf for being able to walk now without getting breathless.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ruptured-lung-repaired-through-emergency-surgery/article32777024.ece

301,2020/10/06,"Doctors, fearing ‘tsunami’ of COVID-19 cases after Durga Puja, caution Mamata","Any laxity in maintaining health protocols during the festival can be suicidal, they say.

Doctors in West Bengal have written to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee asking her to take strict measures to check crowding during Durga Puja as they feared a ‘tsunami’ of COVID-19 cases after the festival.

Durga Puja is barely two weeks away and people have already started making purchases, with many iconic stores in Kolkata packed with shoppers. This at a time when the number of COVID-19 cases in the State and Kolkata is only climbing. On Tuesday, 85-year-old Soumitra Chatterjee, one of Bengal’s most respected actors, was admitted to Bellevue Clinic after testing positive.

Supporting their letter with a three-day moving-average graph that showed a steep rise in the number of cases in the State after Mahalaya and Vishwakarma Puja, the letter, written by the Joint Platform of Doctors, said: “Giving priority to emotions has resulted in serious neglect of safety protocols. In Kerala, after Onam celebrations, the infection rate went up by 750%. That is why Section 144 had to be imposed there.”

The letter reminded the Chief Minister that though Durga Puja was a much-awaited festival, one should not forget that this was the time of a pandemic, when Ganesh Chaturthi was low-key in Maharashtra and when Dandiya and Garba stand cancelled in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.

“Even in our State, Id and Muharram were observed indoors. The noticeable rise in the number of cases after Mahalaya and Vishwakarma Puja is an indication of things to come. Therefore, any laxity in maintaining health protocols during Durga Puja can be suicidal. There will be a tsunami of cases and the situation will spiral out of control,” said the letter signed by Dr. Hiralal Konar and Dr. Punyabrata Gun.

Saying the sacrifices and efforts made by healthcare workers all these months cannot be allowed to go in vain for the sake of festivities lasting a few days, the letter urged the Chief Minister to ensure that crowding did not take place during the festival and that people stepping out of their homes compulsorily wore masks.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kdejff/article32762281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MAMATABANERJEE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/doctors-fearing-tsunami-of-covid-19-cases-after-puja-caution-mamata/article32782611.ece

303,2020/10/06,Ecosystem services provided by Delhi zoo valued at ₹426 cr.,"TERI data give ‘powerful baseline assessment’ of value

The annual economic value of ecosystem services provided by the Delhi zoo works out to be ₹426 crore, an assessment by the The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and commissioned by the Central Zoo Authority has found.

These ‘ecosystem services’ constitute heads such as biodiversity conservation, employment generation, education and research, carbon sequestration and recreational and cultural contributions. When one-time ecosystem services are considered, such as carbon storage, the surrogate value of land and land value of Delhi zoo, their contribution climbs to nearly ₹55,209 crore, says the report released by Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday.

‘First-of-its-kind study’

The ‘first-of-its-kind’ study in India gave a “powerful baseline assessment” of the important ecosystem services provided by the zoo. “The way forward is to have an in-depth valuation of those ecosystem services which are not being valued due to limited time and resource,” the report notes.

These estimates could be used to compute value provided by zoos across India.

To commemorate World Wildlife Week, Mr. Javadekar said the government was working towards upgrading and developing 160 zoos in the PPP mode.

The researchers found the number of visitors to Delhi zoo had increased with 20 lakh tourists visiting every year. Costs incurred on travel (distance cost), along with the entrance fee, time spent were adjusted for when estimating the value of recreational service. “The survey revealed that the average per day income of the tourists visiting the zoo is ₹655. The per-head average transportation amounted to ₹428.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/ecosystem-services-provided-by-delhi-zoo-valued-at-426-cr/article32777018.ece

Communist Party of India (Marxist) cadre and public on Tuesday attempted to lay siege to the municipal office here protesting against the poor state of roads in the town due to inordinate delay in execution of underground drainage and new drinking water scheme works.

District secretary of the party K. Arjunan led them.

“Residents are undergoing untold sufferings due to lackadaisical attitude of officials. Firstly, there was no planning in execution of both the works. Secondly, there was no coordination among officials of different departments,” complained the party Rajapalayam town secretary, B. Mariappan.

The works that started in 2018 has left roads unmotorable almost in all parts of the 42 wards.

“The work has not been completed even in part of the town. Even the dug up roads had not been levelled for use by motorists. Two persons have died due to bad condition of the road,” he alleged.

Meanwhile, Rajapalayam Tahsildar, K.L. Sridhar, held talks with the agitators along with other officials.

“The Municipal Commissioner has promised to level all the roads where the works have been executed in one week,” Mr. Sridhar said.

Besides, the officials executing the UGD and Tamirabarani Combined Drinking Water Scheme were asked to closely coordinate with each other.

“They have been asked to identify and make a list of roads where no further digging is required. Municipal authorities have promised to provide black topping on those roads at the earliest,” he added.

The officials have been instructed to ensure quality of work and materials in construction of manholes for UGD.

Ahead of the northeast monsoon, a total of 27 vulnerable areas have been identified in the district and flood mitigation measures are under way, said District Monitoring Officer B. Chandra Mohan, here on Tuesday.

He was addressing the mediapersons, along with Collector T.G. Vinay and Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan, after chairing a meeting to discuss the district's preparedness ahead of the monsoon. Dr. Chandra Mohan also inspected various works that were undertaken as part of the preparedness ahead of the monsoon.

Out of the total vulnerable areas, 25 areas are within Madurai Corporation limits and the rest are in rural areas. Most of the areas are low-lying spots along the Vaigai. “The Corporation and the Highways Departments are constructing a retaining wall along the Vaigai as part of the Smart Cities Mission and this will help to reduce the vulnerability of the low-lying spots along the river,” he said.

A district disaster management plan has been prepared and multi-departmental committees have visited the vulnerable spots to identify the problems.

The 13 channels in the city are being desilted and garbage is being removed from them. “The Corporation has been instructed to prepare a detailed action plan to ensure that all the roads that are dug up under Smart Cities Mission are safe for public movement during the northeast monsoon,” he said.

With many works related to monsoon preparedness being completed, the remaining works will be finished before the onset of the monsoon, said the Monitoring Officer.

Mr. Visakan said that 10 ‘ooranis” (ponds) within the purview of the Corporation have been desilted and renovated ahead of the monsoon. Rainwater harvesting structures have been constructed at around 200 low-lying spots in the city.

Madurai

Around 68% of the residents of Madurai city wear face masks every time, including instances when they step outside their homes or even have visitors at home. However, only 10.8% of the residents avoid crowded places, reveals a behavioural surveillance study conducted in 100 wards of the city by the district administration.

Addressing the mediapersons here on Tuesday, the District Monitoring Officer B. Chandra Mohan elaborated the key results and observations of this study which was conducted during July and August.

“Since usage of face masks, frequent handwashing and maintaining six feet distance in public places are key measures to prevent COVID-19 virus transmission, we conducted this baseline survey to understand the knowledge, attitude and practices that people follow to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic,” he added.

The survey was conducted by the students, alumni and faculty of Madurai Institute of Social Sciences with consultation from private parties. A structured questionnaire was prepared and sent to the 2,125 randomly selected respondents, who filled it using their smartphones.

Dr. Chandra Mohan said that respondents were all aged above 18 years and were categorised into different age groups, with maximum interviewees falling within the age category of 30 to 60 years.

A total of 68.6% of the respondents said that they wear face masks every time. Four percentage of the respondents answered that they rarely wear face masks. “While it is encouraging to see that a large proportion of the population wear face masks, we are aiming to bring a behavioural change so that all the residents wear face masks every time they step out of their homes,” said the Monitoring Officer.

Another key finding was that 67.2% of the respondents washes hands using sanitisers or hand wash every time in various situations. While 27.1% of the respondents washes hands sometimes, the rest rarely wash their hands.

When asked about maintaining physical distancing in public places, only 10.8% of the respondents said that they will avoid crowded places. While 42.1% of the respondents said that they will maintain three feet distance, a total of 21% of the interviewees said it maintains a minimum of six feet distance in public places.

Collector T.G. Vinay, who was present during the meet, said that they will step up the monitoring in public and crowded places.

For questions asked about the steps taken to protect elderly persons against COVID-19, around 11.1% of the respondents said that they isolate them at home. Only 7.7% of the respondents said that they will avoid close contact with elderly persons at home.

Dr. Chandra Mohan said that despite the relaxations for the past one month, there has not been a spike in positive cases in the district. “But, the public must cooperate with the officials and follow the safety precautions to further bring down the cases,” he added.

The Collector said that a team will conduct a similar study to find out the correlation between the wards where cases are high and the compliance of safety precautions there.

Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan said fine is imposed on those who fail to wear face masks in public places. All markets are monitored by officials to regulate the crowd, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/voyj3n/article32788492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07MASurvey,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/only-108-of-residents-avoid-crowded-places-study/article32784454.ece

In view of the pandemic, hill stations like Kodaikanal and Nilgiris remained out of bounds for the public.

Initially, the government agreed to permit only people from the Dindigul district to go to the hill station after repeated pleas from tourist operators and resort owners. The guidelines were further relaxed since September and more tourists started thronging the hill station.

According to the officials at the Collectorate, 7,128 applications seeking e-passes were issued between Oct. 2 and Oct. 4.

Police and health officials at the Silver Cascade and entry point to the Kodaikanal township said that vehicles had piled up for so long that it took close to two hours to ease the traffic on Oct. 2. The rooms were full and vehicles moved around the lake beyond the permitted time. An official at the municipal office said they have instructed all stakeholders to ensure that tourists adhered to physical distancing norms, among other guidelines. However, the instructions were not followed. Public places, especially Bryant Park, were heavily crowded.

Many restaurants increased the tariff due to the sudden rise in the number of visitors. Likewise, many cottages increased the rates, said Antony, who had come from Bangalore with his friends. However, tourists, who came from a nearby point, returned home the same evening after going round the lake and a few other spots, operators said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/e-pass/article32784362.ece

Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan, has appealed to Union Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, to increase the ceiling for the waiver of compound interest on loans for the moratorium period, following the COVID-19 lockdown.

Welcoming the move to provide the waiver on compound interest for loans up to ₹2 crore, Mr. Venkatesan, said that the ceiling of ₹2 crore would not benefit medium industrial units. Pointing to the affidavit filed by the Centre in the Supreme Court revealing its inclination to provide the compound interest waiver for the moratorium period, Mr. Venkatesan said that ₹2 crore was a very low amount.

“This has created concern among MSME entrepreneurs on whether this would really benefit them to emerge from this severe crisis. Hence the government has to increase the ceiling for the waiver prescribed for loans to the MSME sector in such a way as to cover all Micro, Small and Medium industries,” he said. Besides, he said that the decision for the waiver should cover all kinds of financial institutions including non-banking financial institutions and said he expected announcement in this regard with much more clarity.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/compound-interest-waiver-madurai-mp-wants-increase-in-ceiling-of-loans/article32782155.ece
318,2020/10/06,Fall armyworm spotted in maize fields in Madurai,"Farmers are worried about possible crop damage, but Agriculture Department officials have said the infestation of the pest is at an early stage, and can be brought under control

In the villages of T. Kallupatti and Sedapatti in Madurai district, farmers have reported spotting fall armyworm, an invasive pest, in maize fields. Officials from the Agricultural Department, who recently inspected the maize fields however, say that the infestation of the pest is at the beginning stage, and can be brought under control by following safety precautions.

Maize is cultivated in around 11,000 hectares in the district, with the majority of the area falling within rain-fed blocks, as it is not a water-intensive crop. Maize farmers are worried about possible crop damage that could be caused by the fall armyworm, said M. Muthuveeran, president of the Peraiyur Farmers’ Association. “The farmers faced heavy financial losses in the previous years due to fall armyworm attacks. Many farmers have still not received the insurance for the crops that were damaged in previous years,” he added.

S. Sathuragiri, a farmer from Salichandai village in T. Kallupatti block, said that unlike other pests, the fall armyworm can destroy the entire crop. “Many farmers are able to find out about the attack only after the attack becomes severe. The proliferation of the pest is also fast,” he added.

An official from the Agricultural Department, who had surveyed the affected fields, said that the damage was below the economic threshold level. “We have instructed farmers to use Metarhizium, a bio-pesticide, to protect the crop in the initial stages,” he said.

M. Santhi, Professor and Head of Department of Agricultural Entomology, Tamil Nadu Agricultural College and Research Institute, Madurai, said that the fall armyworm had not entered the whorl of the crop in the fields that were inspected. “Since the infestation is at the early stage, we have issued pamphlets to the farmers regarding the safety measures that they need to adopt to prevent a massive fall armyworm attack,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tpzmqa/article32780091.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06OCTTH--Wormjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/fall-armyworm-spotted-in-maize-fields-in-madurai/article32780092.ece

The government on Tuesday appointed SBI’s senior-most Managing Director Dinesh Kumar Khara as the chairman of the the country’s largest lender.

He replaces Rajnish Kumar, who completed his three-year term on Tuesday.

The central government appoints Dinesh Kumar Khara as chairman of State Bank of India (SBI) for a period of three years with effect from the date of his taking over charge of the post on or after October 7, 2020 or until further orders, whichever is earlier, according to a notification issued by the Finance Ministry.

Last month, the Banks Board Bureau (BBB) had recommended Mr. Khara as the next chairman of SBI.

As per convention, the SBI chairman is appointed from a pool of serving managing directors at the bank.

Interestingly, Mr. Khara was among the contenders for the chairman’s post in 2017 as well.

Mr. Khara was appointed as managing director of SBI in August 2016 for a three-year term. He got a two-year extension in 2019 after review of his performance.

An alumnus of the Faculty of Management Studies, Delhi University, Khara heads the Global Banking division of SBI. He holds a board-level position and supervises the businesses of SBI’s non-banking subsidiaries.

Prior to being appointed managing director, he was the MD and CEO of SBI Funds Management Pvt Limited (SBIMF).

327,2020/10/06,"CIL capex utilisation at ₹5,023 cr in first half of FY21","The capex utilisation in April-September was at an all-time high of 118% in the first half of any fiscal, the PSU said in a statement

State-owned Coal India on Tuesday said its capital expenditure was at ₹5,023 crore in the first six months of 2020-21 financial year.

The capex utilisation in April-September was at an all-time high of 118% in the first half of any fiscal, the PSU said in a statement.

“Coal India’s (CIL) capital expenditure at ₹5,023 crore ending first half of the ongoing fiscal capped an all-time high of 118 per cent utilisation against the provisioned target of ₹4,247 crore,” the PSU said in a statement.

“This is a historic high in capex utilisation as CIL has not exceeded 30 per cent target utilisation in the first half of a fiscal so far. The previous three year average of H1 capex utilisation has been around 20 per cent,” a senior official of the company said.

CIL during April-September clocked a robust capex growth of 242% compared to ₹1,467 crore in April-September period of previous fiscal.

“Actual capex ending Q2 of the current fiscal at ₹4,179 crore was up by ₹3,165 crore compared to ₹ 1,014 crore in the same quarter last year logging a whopping 312% growth,” the PSU said.

In the second quarter as well, CIL achieved 118% utilisation breaching the provisioned target of ₹3,527 crore.

The government had recently asked CPSEs, including CIL, to speed up their capital expenditure to boost growth especially by the end of the second quarter of 2020-21.

CIL’s capex spend during the first half of the ongoing fiscal was a little over half of the planned expenditure of ₹10,000 crore for the full fiscal.

Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi has been closely monitoring the progress of processes like land acquisition, setting up of rail logistics and associated infrastructure and mine development of especially mega mine projects and speeding them up.

Payments were made for acquisition of land post COVID unlock. Major high value tenders could be concluded on time and heavy earth moving equipment (HEMM) was procured. CIL’s robust capex spending came on the back of these issues.

Among the major heads, purchase of HEMM at ₹1,360 crore accounted for 27% of the total capex of the first half. It was followed by payments for acquisition for mining operations which made up close to 26% of the capex where CIL spent ₹1,289 crore. Setting up important rail lines and developing sidings constituted around 21% of the H1 capex.

CIL spent ₹1,078 crore under this head. These three heads combined at ₹3,726 crore made up for around 74% of the first half’s entire capex. The components for the rest 26% or ₹1,297 crore include mine development, coal handling plants, silos, roads, exploration and prospecting, other plant and machinery and joint venture investments.

“Land acquisition on fast track mode with the support of Ministry of Coal and modernisation of equipment and deployment of it in OC mines will pave way for ramping up our production, productivity. Concurrent development of rail and other logistics will boost evacuation facilities to transport increased output,” the official said.

Coal India accounts for over 80% of domestic coal output.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/cil-capex-utilisation-at-5023-cr-in-first-half-of-fy21/article32782822.ece

He also hinted that the bank may post a strong set of quarterly numbers in the recently ended July-September period and quarters ahead as well.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in job losses, especially in the organised sectors, as businesses suffered due to economic activity coming to a halt in lockdowns. HDFC Bank and its private sector competitors have met hikes and bonuses commitments since the start of the pandemic.

“Not only are your jobs secure, your increment is also secure. Your bonus and your promotion are secure,” Mr. Puri told over 1.15 lakh employees of the bank, in a video message last week.

Mr. Puri, who has led the bank for over 25 years since its inception, said he is giving the assurance on behalf of the management team including his successor Sashidhar Jagdishan.

“The bank is doing well. We have all the capital that we need. Our portfolio is not under strain. We are aggressively using our distribution and technology advantage,” he said.

He urged employees to work as a team, follow the vision the lender has set out for itself and beat competition.

Mr. Puri was speaking ahead of the launch of festive offers by the lender in its second edition.

Competing banks have also launched similar aggressive offerings, eyeing larger share of transactions amid slowing consumption.

He said the bank has not accepted defeat in the face of the coronavirus outbreak and delivered good results for two quarters, and added that projections for the upcoming quarters also say the same.

Westlife Development, which operates McDonald’s restaurants in the southern and western region in India, on Tuesday said it is re-starting the dine-in operations in Maharashtra after remaining shut for over six months due to COVID-19.

Last week, the Maharashtra government issued coronavirus-related Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for restaurants that are set to re-open from October 5 with 50% occupancy.

“After a six-month-long COVID-19 led lockdown on restaurants, Westlife Development, the company that owns and operates McDonald’s restaurants in west and south India, is all set to reopen its doors for customers in Maharashtra. The company has left no stone unturned to ensure a completely safe and hygienic experience for its employees and customers,” it said in a regulatory filing.

Saurabh Kalra, Chief Operating Officer, McDonald’s India (West and South), said the dine-in operations in the State are opening after more than six months and the company is committed to making the experience completely safe, hygienic and special for its customers.

Through its “Golden Guarantee platform”, Westlife Development said McDonald’s India West and South has put in place new processes that ensure that the food is prepared and served without being touched by bare hands.

331,2020/10/06,An unconstitutional harvest,"The best way forward for aggrieved States is to challenge the constitutionality of the new farm laws

Since independence, Minimum Support Price (MSP) has served as an insurance to farmers, in the form of income security for their produce. As many as 23 vital farm products are supported by the MSP regime. Yet, it has no legislative backing.

Recently, three laws were passed, which the Central government described as necessary farm reforms. Two of these are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act (FPTC Act), and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act (FAPAFS Act). Unsurprisingly, none refer to the MSP. The stated object of these laws is to provide farmers an additional marketplace for selling their produce by institutionalising contract farming, whilst reducing the dependency on government-controlled APMC-designated mandis, where farmers are often forced to pay high commissions to intermediaries.

Abuse of federalism

Agriculture falls within the exclusive legislative competence of State governments, through Entry 14 of the State List. However, the Acts in question have been enacted by Parliament, seemingly deriving the legislative competence to do so under Entry 33 of the Concurrent List, which deals with ‘trade and commerce’ of some products listed in that Entry. This inference is axiomatic as the FPTC Act (defining ‘farmers’ produce’), and the FAPAFS Act (defining ‘farming produce’), borrow the items enumerated in Entry 33. The list of items provided under Entry 33 is an exhaustive one. However, the two definitions take leaps beyond the exhaustive set of items enumerated in the said Entry, by also including what can practically be considered as the entirety of farming output — “...wheat, rice or other coarse grains, pulses, vegetables, fruits, nuts, spices, sugarcane and products of poultry, piggery, goatery, fishery and dairy...” — none of which find mention in Entry 33.

The definitions of ‘farmer’ and ‘farming produce’ are at the heart of these laws, as they lay out the items in which any trade beyond the mandis can take place. Including the vast majority of agricultural produce in such definitions amounts to an egregious breach of legislative competence by the Union government as it is the States which are empowered to enact laws regulating ‘agriculture’.

Despite this clear constitutional position, the statement of objects and reasons accompanied with these Acts attempts to give an impression of being intended towards reform in the agricultural sector while drawing upon purported powers under Entry 33, despite the Entry not explicitly including within its ambit the expansive definition of farming produce as referred to in the Acts. In short, this is a case of abuse of federalism.

The way forward

States like Punjab are considering declaring all of their territory as ‘mandi’ to circumvent the effect of these laws. However, it is doubtful if their respective APMC Acts permit the same; and in any case such knee-jerk reactions would surely involve scrutiny from the courts. Constitutionally speaking, however, there exists a strong case for aggrieved State Governments to invoke Article 131 of the Constitution and file a suit challenging the vires of the two laws.

Whilst doing so, State governments could also explore the potential of granting MSP a legislative backing, at least within the mandis, since any MSP is a matter of government largesse, and not a legally enforceable right with farmers. This move would incentivise farmers to sell their produce at the mandi at assured rates rather than expose themselves to the whims and caprices of private players. At the same time, demands from opposition parties to impose MSP upon private players could be at loggerheads with the free market economy principle enshrined under Article 301 of the Constitution. It is in view of these complexities that the best way forward for the States is to challenge the very constitutionality of these laws.

332,2020/10/06,Breaking the law over Brexit,"Boris Johnson’s Brexit position completely overlooks constitutional developments in the U.K. since the late 1990s

The latest spectacular development in the Brexit saga is the Internal Market Bill that was passed in the House of Commons. The Bill has caused uproar in the U.K. and across the world as it breaks international law by going back on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill signed by the Boris Johnson government in January 2020. That a country that considers itself home of the rule of law would break international law is ironic. Brandon Lewis, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the U.K. government, admitted in the House of Commons that the Bill would break international law in “a very specific and limited way”. The European Union (EU) has initiated legal action against the U.K. over the Bill.

The possibility of destabilisation

More dramatic is the possibility that Brexit could bring about the Balkanisation of the U.K. into its constituent nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Island. The term “tukde tukde”, coined in noisy news debates in India and translated for the British as fragments of the nation, could actually be applicable to Britain, which stares at the possibility of destabilisation. Among the nations that constitute the U.K., Scotland and Northern Ireland would become the major lines of fracture. While the Brexit process and Mr. Johnson’s hard Brexit stance have been believed to be the catalyst for the current situation in the U.K., Mr. Johnson has suggested that the threat to the territorial integrity of the U.K. comes from the EU.

Also read: U.K. warns EU on Brexit: We won't blink first

The unfolding of the Brexit process has revealed the likelihood of a hard border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., and the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the EU. To prevent such a possibility, the EU had negotiated an earlier backstop arrangement with the previous Theresa May-led British government. The backstop arrangement was akin to an insurance policy to prevent the possibility of a restrictive hard border that would impede the flow of goods and people. Mr. Johnson had always balked at the idea of a backstop. In the Withdrawal Agreement Bill that he had signed with the EU, the Northern Ireland protocol was introduced to eliminate the possibility of a hard border and achieve the aims of the earlier backstop. It is the provisions of the protocol that he himself signed that Mr. Johnson is now backtracking on with the new Bill.

Mr. Johnson’s Brexit position completely overlooks constitutional developments in the U.K. since the late 1990s, beginning with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. A major achievement of the Tony Blair government, the Agreement ended violent decades of troubles in Northern Ireland and brought peace and stability in the region in the last two decades. It is this stability that the Brexit process threatens to undo. Following closely on the heels of the Good Friday Agreement, significant devolution of powers was effected with the nations that constitute the U.K., resulting in regional parliaments in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

Also read: Britain’s last day in the EU | Here is a chronology of Brexit

Ostensibly, the Johnson government’s Internal Market Bill seeks to create a single uniform market across the four nations of the U.K. A measure taken by one of the parliaments would have to be accepted across all four nations to maintain the viability of the unified internal market. The reality could actually be a significant undermining of the rigorous food, health and safety regulations that have been hitherto upheld by the EU. The example that has most often been used is the possibility of chlorine washed chicken imported from the U.S. filling up shelves in U.K. supermarkets.

On a decline

Since the end of World War II, the U.K. has been on a decline. Yet, on account of a fortuitous combination of soft power through the reach of its cultural exports, the prestige of its university system, and the vast scale of London as a leading financial centre, it has maintained its position somewhere near the top in the league table of nations. Ardent Brexiteers in the true spirit of ‘Rule, Britannia!’ seek to restore the glory days of Britain’s dominance. For this to happen, in their view, Britain has to stop being a more or less equal partner with Germany and France in the EU and ride subordinate on the coat-tails of the U.S. For Brexit critics, the phenomenon is just one more confirmation of the implosion of the U.K.

Perhaps Mr. Johnson and his special adviser Dominic Cummings could heed a bit of oriental advice. A wise ruler explained his ability to keep his countrymen together by suggesting that the tie that bound him to many of them in far-off provinces could sometimes be as fragile as a single strand of hair that he would never break. When his countrymen pulled, he would loosen his hold, and when he felt them relaxing their hold, he would make it a point to pull them closer. Brexit, with its extreme centripetal tendencies, is just the opposite of this sagely advice.

333,2020/10/06,India needs a rainbow recovery plan,"Such an approach would require integration of ecological protection and tackling inequality

The world could emerge from COVID-19 so much the worse by attempting ‘business as usual’, or it could take pathways to a more just, sustainable future. In Europe and the U.S., a ‘green new deal’ (GND) proposed by some from the political mainstream puts the climate and employment crises at the centre of economic recovery. In India, we have a chance to build on our genius and heritage to forge a multihued approach — a rainbow new deal (RND).

By RND, I refer to a seamless integration of ecological protection and tackling of wealth inequality and economic vulnerability of several hundreds of millions of people. Green meets red, so to speak. But ‘green’ itself is a restricted environmentalism; the oceans and rivers and natural deserts and mountains together are a lot more colours. I also include here recognition of multiple genders and sexualities from whose movements I borrow the symbol of the rainbow.

What would RND entail?

Our most urgent task is to generate dignified, sustainable livelihoods for the vast majority of the population and workforce that is today living precarious lives. And this has to be built on regenerating and safeguarding the country’s soil, natural ecosystems, water, biological diversity, and air. We should never forget that the more we destroy it, the more we invite crises, from COVID-19 to climate.

The nearly 200 million small farmers, pastoralists, and fishers can be enabled to sustain or switch to organic, ecologically sustainable production, with their own food security as the highest priority, and with local marketing links. This would include over 10 million people who appear to have gone back to agriculture in the COVID-19 period.

Next, the RND could encourage lifestyles and livelihoods that obtain substantial food, medicines, household items and other needs, as also sustainable livelihoods, from natural ecosystems. Forest-based livelihoods alone, for instance, can support 100 million people.

Third, it would entail reviving and sustaining India’s incredible diversity of crafts, and decentralised production of most goods and services, across all villages and towns, with a massive investment in the small and medium sector enterprises. This could gainfully employ 200 million people. All such production could be run democratically as producer companies or cooperatives. For all the above, schemes like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme could be re-oriented and extended, including for urban livelihoods.

Then, the RND would entail substantial investments in public health, education, housing, transportation and other basic needs. If these are run in a decentralised way, with appropriate training, they could generate many more millions of jobs. The same could be for other services like digital networks and communications, as also decentralised infrastructure development by worker collectives. All of this would be within ecologically sustainable limits, and specially focused on empowering and benefiting the most marginalised people.

In such a recovery, big companies need to be kept out. Soap, footwear, furniture, clothes, energy, and myriad other items of everyday use can be produced by community-run units across the country. ‘Made in India’ should be ‘Handmade in India’ by local workers. In a recent webinar, Suresh Chhanga, sarpanch of Kunariya village in Kachchh in Gujarat, proposed that they can save ₹40 lakh a month on such items by producing them locally. Elango Rangasamy, former Dalit sarpanch of Kuthambakkam village in Tamil Nadu, proposes a ‘network economy’, in which clusters of villages can be self-reliant for most basic needs, and exchange with neighbouring clusters what they cannot produce or grow. Ela Bhatt, founder of SEWA, has proposed the ‘100 mile radius’ as a region within which the objective of self-reliance can be met. These are all currently relevant versions of Mahatma Gandhi’s focus on self-reliance.

There are hundreds of initiatives already demonstrating the feasibility of such an approach. Many are run by workers and communities themselves. Government-sponsored programmes like Kudumbashree in Kerala and Jharcraft in Jharkhand show how they can be significantly scaled with state support. During the COVID-19 lockdown, community resilience based on such initiatives was amply demonstrated.

But let’s be clear: such RND will succeed only if there is a fundamental move away from a privatised, capitalist economy, and an authoritarian state, and head-on tackling of casteism, patriarchy and other structures of inequality. There are many successful initiatives at empowering women, Dalits, Adivasis, landless, the LGBTQ+ community and the disabled to learn from.

This also means a serious attempt at land reforms, including recognising collective rights over the commons: forests, grasslands, coastal and marine areas, biodiversity, wetlands, water, and knowledge. Legislation similar to the Forest Rights Act, and community mobilisation to implement it, is needed for all other ecosystems.

Wealth redistribution

Where substantial public investments are needed, serious wealth redistribution is called for. As economist Prabhat Patnaik has pointed out, a mere 2% wealth tax coupled with a 33% inheritance tax on the richest 1% of India could generate more revenue than the total recovery package the Government of India announced in May 2020 .

It is of course foolish to expect the government to go for such RND. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ programme, with all its doublespeak on ‘self-reliance’, places India’s economy even more into the hands of private capital and big players. Massive, informed public mobilisation is needed to counter this policy regression.

The recent protests by lakhs of young people against the regressive Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2020 and against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens provide hope. If these diverse strands of resistance, feminist, worker, farmer, and other mobilisations of the marginalised, and myriad grassroots initiatives at alternative living all can be synergised, a RND kind of transformation may yet be on the horizon.

334,2020/10/06,Re-imagining education in an India at 100,"In 2047, a teacher’s role, based on five principles, will be to oversee the transformative re-birth of citizens

After 34 years, India rekindled the conversation on its National Education Policy (NEP) in 2020. A policy is as good as it is actualised in practice and it would be ideal to explore the contours of national education practices leading to 2047 when politically independent India becomes 100 years old. From a teacher’s perspective, the next education practices can be viewed through the following five design principles.

To excel is key

Autonomy: Currently, the clamour for autonomy in education practices is a mixed bag of pretentious idealism and hard-nosed practicality. The Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) Bill, 2017 granting autonomy to the IIMs has now become an Act. In helming a first generation IIM for two terms, one has seen no dramatic variation in the nature of autonomy of the IIMs. The reason for this is that the IIMs, as indeed the Indian Institutes of Technology, have been performing institutions with robust self-correcting systems. The greatest insurance for autonomy is excellence in students’ outcomes rather than a piece of legislation. As long as institutions continue to excel, they will earn their autonomy through social, community and citizens’ sanctions. Legislation may help. However, institutions and institutional leaders who are trained for blind conformity will find exercise of autonomy rather difficult even if the law is on their side. In practice, autonomy cannot be defined by entitlement nor limited by unlawful encroachment. Mere assumption of autonomy does not ensure exercise of autonomy. By 2047, autonomy has to be imbibed as an institutional culture rather than a personal perquisite of a vice chancellor, principal or a director. There will be autonomy in teaching methods, autonomy of the learner in creating her own curriculum, autonomy of thought and self-governance — Swayttata.

Technology-rich settings

Learning: In 2047, six billion people in the world would constitute the middle class. With little money but with enormous hunger for learning, they will define the learner base for a networked global university system. Technology will proliferate intelligence from hardware to software to everywhere. Smart schools and smart classes may soon morph to smart chairs and smart desks. Intelligence can be embedded into everything. Smart chairs will have sensors to map the flow of attention in the classrooms. On the other hand, the intangibles of the teaching learning process such as creativity, mentorship and facilitation of learning will give birth to the quest for mastery. Teachers will evolve from ring masters to zen masters, raising awareness rather than delivering content. The four core tasks of the university: creation; dissemination; accreditation and monetisation of knowledge will require a sweet synthesis of algorithm and altruism. Learning will involve mobilisation of knowledge for a specific person; is a specific context to face specific challenges or problems. In the ultimate analysis, learning will be about propagation of crucial questions rather than pre-determined answers. Pressure of performance will have to co-exist with the pleasure and ecstasy of learning — ananda.

Coherence across fields

Trans-disciplinarity: The new National Education Policy (NEP) roots for multi-disciplinary institutions rather than standalone schools. Multidisciplinarity involves experts from different disciplines working together, each drawing on their unique disciplinary knowledge. In a world that is going to be more complex and volatile, expertise from multiple disciplines will be required to construct an understanding of the real life problems we will face. The challenges that COVID-19 has thrown before us require medical scientists, economists, historians, architects, health workers and political scientists and more experts to bring their disciplinary depth to the table. Frequent flooding of our cities is at once an urban planning issue, an engineering issue, environmental issue, public health issue, and of course a political issue that requires many diverse fields to create an understanding of the nature of the problem and its solution. However, by 2047, trans-disciplinarity rather than multi-disciplinarity will be the norm. Transdisciplinarity is about creating a coherence of intellectual frameworks beyond the disciplinary perspectives. Knowledge in 2047 will move from discipline-based units to the unity of meaning and understanding. The reductionist knowledge of the West that explains the whole as the sum of parts will yield space to the quest for the part less whole that the rishis of the Upanishads described as purnatwa.

School as a connecting hub

Technology-innovation: Technology-led innovation will take learning from cognition to immersion. The content of knowledge has evolved from text that had to be cognised to include visual, audio and tactile immersive experiences. Traditionally, students of professional courses learnt through field and factory visits. Today, it is possible for a factory experience to be simulated in a classroom. A leading global engineering company, ABB, is using virtual reality to simulate a factory experience inside a school. A classroom will not be a place but a space. In 2047, school will not be a brick and mortar house but a connecting hub that will digitally decode, deliver and disperse knowledge. Disruptive innovation will enable technology to give greater access to hitherto exclusive knowledge and fulfil unmet learner needs. A vice chancellor’s office will look a lot more like a tech-studio. Technology will not be a cosmetic add-on but serve a strategic purpose. Leading schools of the world will harness talent and technology seamlessly.

Nurturing minds with values

Values, mindset and culture: By 2047, Indian teachers will be engaged in nurturing global mindsets based on three classical values of India: satyam (authenticity), nityam (sustainability) and purnam (wholeness). Mindsets will be based on how learners receive information and not what information they receive; on how to think rather than what to think. Education is finally about creating and sustaining wholesome cultures rather than serving the templates of outmoded civilisations. The post-colonial Indian education system has managed to create mindsets of clerks and coders and imitators to serve a civilisation that bets on material values of exploitation of nature and increasing consumption. While civilisation is about what we acquire, culture is concerned with who we become. The most valuable outcome of education is the becoming of a competent and compassionate human being. In 2047, a teacher’s role will be to midwife this transformative re-birth of citizens of our great nation.

335,2020/10/06,Pandemic peak: On Finance Ministry's report,"The economy needs to be unlocked with caution, without resort to irrational optimism

The Finance Ministry in a report said that while the pandemic was far from over in India, the country may be “past its peak” of the COVID-19 case load. It premised this on a declining case load from September 17-30 when the daily positive cases dipped from 90,000 to 83,000 a day. This, along with an increase in testing had led to a falling test-positivity (or the number of tests needed to find a positive case) and so was a sign that India ought to be ‘further freeing up its economy.’ The pandemic being past its peak in India is irrational optimism. Last week the chief of the Indian Council of Medical Research, while announcing the results of the second all-India serology survey, said only 7% of Indians had been exposed to the virus. The Health Minister too, referencing the same survey, said that India was “far from any sort of herd immunity.” The decline from 90,000 cases a day to around 75,000 for over a fortnight is certainly welcome but can be deceptive. In the United States, daily cases steadily plummeted from 70,000 in July to 24,000 in September, to ascend again to 50,000 this week. India’s test positivity is declining but not substantially. On September 23 it was 8.52% and as of October 4 had fallen to 8.29% — an improvement but not close to the World Health Organization-suggested safety barrier of less than 5%.

What further complicates projections based on ephemeral undulations in cases is that it does not take into account the dynamic nature of the virus itself. The early optimism that its spread may be contained by changes in the weather, behavioural modifications and imposing a sudden, stringent lockdown has been belied. If a complete shutdown could not stop it, it is hard to fathom how allowing public transport and religious congregations, permitting schools and educational institutions to restart, opening up malls in a season that is particularly conducive to viruses, will not catalyse the movement to a new peak. The so-called peak is a statistical artefact closely connected to the number of tests a country administers. If testing were to decline, more cases would be undetected, and conversely, an increase in tests could push this hypothetical point even further. Therefore, it is only after sufficient time has elapsed and in retrospect that a country’s peak can be inferred. India has been opening up the economy and this increases the average person’s exposure to the virus. Countries with much fewer cases have been far more cautious with opening. The lockdown had shown the disruption in the economy, and it is understandable if Finance Ministry officials seek a justification for opening up. But just as it would be surprising for epidemiologists to forecast GDP growth, officials ought not to be prognosticating outside their ken merely to revive economic sentiment, when several alternatives based on fact and reason exist.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pandemic-peak-on-finance-ministrys-report/article32776225.ece
336,2020/10/06,People’s court: On Madhya Pradesh by-elections,"By-elections in Madhya Pradesh will likely redefine its politics over the longer term

The ruling BJP and the opposition Congress are face-to-face in by-elections in 28 Assembly constituencies in Madhya Pradesh scheduled for November 3. Unfortunate circumstances — deaths of three sitting MLAs — and resignations of 25 Congress MLAs have led to these by-elections, within two years of the election in 2018 that had brought the Congress to power with the support of independents and smaller parties. The BJP displaced the Congress in March, following the defection of 22 Congress MLAs. Three more followed suit in later months. Most of these 25 are likely to enter the fray as BJP candidates this time. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is leading the BJP campaign and he needs to win at least nine seats to have an absolute majority in the Assembly of 230. The BJP now has 107 MLAs. The Congress has 88 MLAs and it needs to win all the 28 seats to return to power on its own. If it wins 21, four Independent MLAs, two BSP MLAs and one SP MLA will be in play again. The BJP has the advantage of being in power at the Centre and in the State, but the Congress led by former Chief Minister Kamal Nath is trying to wrest power by drawing attention to its own record over a period of more than a year, and the failings of the present government.

Most of these seats are around Gwalior, areas considered as the sphere of influence of Jyotiraditya Scindia who led the Congress defectors to the BJP. The entry of adversaries has complicated power balances within the BJP in the State. Mr. Chouhan’s effectiveness in the usurpation of power has not extended to governance in the following months, and Madhya Pradesh’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic has been chaotic. The Congress campaign puts the spotlight on the mismanagement of the pandemic, and it has promised a government job to each family that has lost a member to the disease. A considerable population from these northern regions of the State used to work in urban centres outside the State and they had to return in distress during the lockdown. Several instances of police brutality earned the State government infamy in recent months. The defector-MLAs will be required to explain their conduct as the Congress accuses them of betraying the 2018 mandate. Along with Mr. Chouhan, Mr. Scindia too is facing a test. Now a Rajya Sabha member from the BJP, he is hoping to be inducted into the Union Cabinet and the results of the by-elections will reflect his political clout in the region and impact his own standing in his new party, the BJP. His exit has ended the infighting in the Congress and opens the possibility of a new politics for it in the Gwalior region. Regardless of the outcomes, these by-elections will signify the reshaping of both the Congress and the BJP in Madhya Pradesh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/peoples-court-on-madhya-pradesh-by-elections/article32776219.ece

The order also states that the civic body should not have any such procedures and processes offline at any stage, and work as per Sakala services must be followed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/udd-tells-bbmp-to-take-various-services-online/article32786460.ece
338,2020/10/06,Traffic-free Cubbon Park campaigners are seeking a special Deepavali gift,"They are gathering letters of support from elected representatives

As the tussle over whether vehicular movement should be allowed inside Cubbon Park continues, volunteers of Traffic Free Cubbon Park campaign have started reaching out to elected representatives for a ‘Deepavali gift’.

The gift they are seeking is a traffic-free Cubbon Park. They are gathering letters, addressed to the Chief Minister, expressing opposition to vehicular movement inside the park.

Prabha Dev, one of the volunteers, said that they had already reached out to city MLAs and MLCs. Many had agreed to support the cause, and some had even sent letters supporting the cause.

“We are expecting a response from all of them. Once we get the letters of support, we will submit a memorandum to the CM with the letters from MLAs and MLCs,” Ms. Dev said and added that it was being done in a democratic way.

“We also protested and we did not want to just end it there. Hence we have taken up this initiative as the State government is adamant on allowing traffic inside the park.”

Volunteers say that the unique campaign has been getting a positive response with various MLAs, including S. Raghu and Sowmya Reddy among others, agreeing to officially extend support to the cause.

Speaking to The Hindu, C.V. Raman Nagar MLA S. Raghu said that the extra time due to a pradakshine around the park, if vehicular movement inside is banned, would not take more than 3-4 minutes. “By banning vehicular movement, we will not only save prime lung space but we will also be venerating the park by putting a pradakshine and setting a great precedent,” he said.

In her letter addressed to the Chief Minister, Jayanagar MLA Sowmya Reddy has stated that like Lalbagh even Cubbon Park ‘should be saved as generational equity’.

“Those using the park as a thoroughfare should avoid it at all costs and instead let pedestrians, elders and children cherish the open space. A prerequisite for dreary cramped urban life,” the letter stated.

Cubbon Park, which was closed for vehicular movement since imposition of the lockdown, was opened for vehicular traffic from the second week of September. General public, many experts and environmentalists and activists have been fighting for years to convert the park into a “no traffic zone”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bwcpl3/article32785940.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGPARKP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/traffic-free-cubbon-park-campaigners-are-seeking-a-special-deepavali-gift/article32785941.ece
339,2020/10/06,Extra polling stations for RR Nagar bypoll,"This would reduce crowding and enable social distancing

Preparations for the November 3 bypoll for the Rajarajeshwari Nagar Assembly constituency are in full swing.

According to sources, following directives issued by the Election Commission, auxiliary (extra) polling stations are being set up as a precautionary measure due to COVID-19. The increased number of polling stations will help reduce crowding and ensure that social distancing norms are followed.

In addition to the 381 polling stations, another 297 will be set up in areas where more than 1,000 votes are expected to be cast in each station.

“It is also decided to change 68 places which had earlier served as polling stations as maintaining social distancing would not be possible there due to space constraints. We have sent the new list to the Election Commission, and information regarding the same will be shared with the general public,” BBMP Commissioner and election in-charge officer N.

340,2020/10/06,Number of wards set to increase to 243,"‘Numerology’ played a small role in arriving at the figure

The number of wards in the city is set to increase to 243 from the current 198, but they will be created within the existing 800 sq.km. under the BBMP’s jurisdiction.

The Legislature Joint Select Committee had recently tabled a plan to increase the number of wards to 250, and an amendment to the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, had been cleared.

Committee Chairperson S. Raghu told The Hindu that they decided to increase the number of wards to 243 after ensuring that the average population of each ward is around 35,000. “The exercise was taken up based on the 2011 census and population projection reports. There has been decadal growth, mostly in outer areas of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). It is, therefore, in these areas that the number of wards has been increased. Around 35 wards will be added in the five outer zones while the rest will be in the core zones,” he said.

He stated that the committee did not favour inclusion of new areas in the BBMP limits.

Delimitation exercise

The government is likely to constitute a committee to take up the delimitation exercise again, now that the number of wards has been increased. Mr. Raghu said the delimitation committee will be constituted along the lines of the committee in Chennai, Tamil Nadu where the city corporation commissioner is the chairperson.

“It will have four members with the BBMP Commissioner as chairperson. The other members will be Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) commissioner, Deputy Commissioner of Bengaluru Urban district and BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Revenue) as its member secretary. The government order with regard to the constitution of the committee is likely to be issued soon,” he added.

Several urban and civic experts have alleged that the whole exercise was a ruse to put off polls to the BBMP council. The five-year term of the BBMP council ended on September 10.

Mr. Raghu rubbished these allegations and maintained that elections to the civic body will be held by the end of this year, or at the very latest early 2021. “There are legislators belonging to the Congress and the Janata Dal (S) in the Joint Select Committee. Even they are supporting the government in this exercise,” he said.

Lucky number 9

The Joint Select Committee, which has decided to increase the number of wards by 45, has not gone solely by the average population per ward, but also considered ‘numerology’ to arrive at 243.

Joint Select Committee Chairperson S. Raghu told The Hindu that both 198 and 243 added up to 9. Based on population criteria, the number of wards actually came up to 242. However, it was increased to 243 to ensure that the numerals added up to nine, he said.

“The wards were increased to 198 by the previous B.S. Yediyurappa government. Now, a government headed by Mr. Yediyurappa has increased the number to 243,” he added.

Sources said that the number nine is considered auspicious by many. There are several government vehicles, especially those used by various ministers, with registration numbers adding up to nine.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/number-of-wards-increased-to-243/article32785499.ece
341,2020/10/06,Drug peddler booked under PIT NDPS Act,"This legislation allows preventive detention for a period of one year without bail

The police on Tuesday arrested a 41-year-old habitual offender and drug dealer under the Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (PIT NDPS) Act, 1988, a law under which preventive detention for a period of one year without bail is possible.

This is the second instance of the police charging a drug peddler under the stringent Act, said a senior police official.

According to the police, the accused, Syed Nazim, had been arrested recently in connection with six cases related to drug peddling. “However, he made bail and resumed dealing in drugs until the K.G. Halli police nabbed him again. Considering the background of the accused, the police filed a detailed report before the Police Commissioner seeking permission to book him under PIT NDPS Act. He was arrested after receiving due approval from the advisory committee of the high court,” said a police officer.

In May, the Central Crime Branch had booked a foreign national, who was named in five cases regarding drug peddling, under the PIT NDPS Act.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/drug-peddler-booked-under-pit-ndps-act/article32785467.ece
342,2020/10/06,Contractors threaten to stop civil work over pending bills,"Civic body unfazed; officials say many of the works were ‘unnecessary’

A section of contractors has threatened to stop all on-going civil works in the city if the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) does not clear their pending bills within seven days.

However, the cash-strapped civic body seems unfazed by the threat.

Civic Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said that the BBMP can make payments only when its financial condition improves.

K.T. Manjunath, president of the BBMP Karyanirata Guttigedarara Sangha, claimed that bills amounting to ₹2,500 crore are pending. “Over the past three months, no bill has been cleared. The BBMP is using the pandemic as a ruse to delay payments,” he alleged.

Contractors are currently carrying out civil works, such as repair and strengthening of drains, parks, footpaths and roads, in various wards worth nearly ₹6,000 crore.

Mr. Manjunath said, “The civic body has been able to collect nearly ₹2,000 crore from citizens as property tax. Why can’t the money be used to clear pending bills?”

However, contractors belonging to another association said they did not support the Sangha. K. Ambikapathy, president of the BBMP Contractors’ Association, said that they have had discussions with both Administrator Gaurav Gupta and Mr. Prasad.

“Both assured that bills for works taken up under the Nava Nagarothana scheme, 14th Finance Commission and State Finance Commission will be cleared from Thursday,” he said and added that some issues with regard to clearing bills were the result of violation of rules by the office of the chief accounts officer (CAO).

Recently, the CAO R. Govindraj was repatriated on charges of dereliction of duty and violation of rules in clearing bills of contractors. The office of the CAO was sealed and an inquiry is under way.

Mr. Prasad told The Hindu that bills for works taken up under various schemes will be cleared with funds from the State government. However, the civic body does not have funds to pay for works taken up in wards under the Programme of Works (POW).

“Despite the poor finances, more payments have been made to contractors this year than last year. We spend around ₹187 crore every month on salaries and solid waste management,” he said.

Senior officials said they would not give in to threats by contractors as many of the civil works under POW were ‘unnecessary’. “If contractors stop taking up these works, it means money saved for the civic body,” an official said.

The official also said that during the recent ward committee meetings, which are being chaired by officials in the absence of elected representatives, members of several RWAs had pointed out to bills being raised for works that were not actually executed.

“We will investigate such cases and cancel payments where applicable, apart from blacklisting the contractors concerned,” the official added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/x2mboo/article32785440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGWARDP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/contractors-threaten-to-stop-civil-work-over-pending-bills/article32785441.ece
343,2020/10/06,BBMP to set up rendering plant for meat waste,"Unauthorised meat shops being identified

Disposal of meat waste is becoming a problem for the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) with hundreds of shops operating without proper authorisation. The civic body has found that the waste from these unauthorised meat shops are being discarded indiscriminately by the side of roads, in drains, in vacant sites or being burnt illegally.

To put an end to this, the BBMP’s Animal Husbandry Department is undertaking a survey to identify authorised and unauthorised meat shops in the city. Once identified, all the shops will be geo-tagged as well, apart from punitive action being initiated against those operating illegally.

BBMP’s Joint Director (Solid Waste Management) Sarfaraz Khan told The Hindu that the disposal of meat waste was not being done effectively, mainly because of the mushrooming of unauthorised meat shops. To scientifically dispose of the waste, the BBMP is opting for deep burial in trenches. However, Mr. Khan noted that there was a need for a rendering plant. The civic body had floated an expression of interest for the setting up of a rendering plant.

Explaining the process, he said animal waste from meat shops and slaughterhouses is converted into protein meal that is used as feed for hogs and in poultry farms. “There are a couple of private rendering plants in the city. We have sought their expertise and have floated the EoI,” said Mr. Khan.

The Department of Animal Husbandry officials have been directed to work with counterparts in the SWM Department to work out the waste output from all these outlets.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-to-set-up-rendering-plant-for-meat-waste/article32779195.ece
344,2020/10/06,Software engineer turns serial chain snatcher,"Formerly a team manager, 39-year-old arrested in Bengaluru for involvement in over 30 cases

Investigation into a chain-snatching complaint by an elderly woman has led the police to arrest a software engineer-turned-serial chain snatcher allegedly involved in over 30 cases.

It all started when the accused, Jayakumar, 39, robbed a 60-gram gold chain from an elderly woman while she was on her way to attend a family function on August 13 near Indira circle in Peenya. The accused intercepted her while on the bike and snatched the chain and sped away. In the impact, the victim fell on the ground and sustained severe injuries. She was admitted to a private hospital where she recovered later.

Considering the seriousness of the crime, the Peenya police collected the CCTV camera footage from in and around the areas and managed to identify Jayakumar and arrested him on Monday.

The police said Jayakumar, a native of Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu and a resident of Banashankari, is an engineering graduate and was the team manager with a major IT company till 2012.

Mudduraj Y., Inspector, Peenya police station, said that Jayakumar was addicted to alcohol and other vices and his salary was not enough to sustain his habits. Unable to attend to work regularly and not getting enough money to meet his expenses, Jayakumar quit the job and joined a gang of notorious habitual offender Karthik and Arun to earn quick money.

The police said the accused has been involved in 22 chain-snatching cases here and 12 in various parts of Tamil Nadu.

In 2019, the Kempegowda Nagar police arrested Jayakumar and remanded him in judicial custody. However, he got out on bail in October 2019 and was absconding since then without attending court hearing.

The police have recovered 15 SIM cards from the accused, which he had borrowed from his relatives to use them to hoodwink the police. The accused would change his hideout frequently to avoid the police, Mr. Mudduraj said.

The police tracked him for one month before arresting him.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/qd7nhp/article32776601.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/snachingmodify,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/software-engineer-turns-serial-chain-snatcher/article32776602.ece
345,2020/10/06,Youngsters beat all odds and now have their eyes on top law university,"Eighteen-year-old Yashwant Kumar said there was a festive atmosphere in his house ever since he checked his results.

While several candidates, who want to pursue law at the leading law universities, decided to take a year off to pursue the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT), here is a story of two candidates who managed to overcome several odds and still managed to bag a top rank in the test without taking a gap year.

Eighteen-year-old Yashwant Kumar, who hails from Masaurhi in Patna district, said there was a festive atmosphere in his house ever since he checked his results. With an All India Rank of 48, Yashwant is eager to join the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru. Son of a mechanic and a homemaker, he said he would be the first person in his family to pursue a graduation course.

He said he was fortunate enough to be an Increasing Diversity by Increasing Access to Legal Education (IDIA) trainee. IDIA is a nonprofit that selects and trains students from underprivileged backgrounds (IDIA Trainees) to crack top law entrance examinations in India. Once they are admitted they also provide a scholarship to these students (IDIA Scholars) which includes financial support, training, and mentorship.

Secret to success

Talking about the secret to success, Yashwant said he was determined to crack the test. “I did not even think of second option,” he said. He also added that he was following the political debates in the country, and he picked law as he felt he would be able to make a difference in the society through this field.

He said IDIA helped him access his online classes during the lockdown. “When I saw people do so much for me, I knew that I had a responsibility to fulfil by doing well in the test,” he said.

Top scorer

The Ambattur zone has 50% of the COVID-19 containment areas in the city. As of Tuesday, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has declared 42 streets as containment zones. Of these, the Ambattur zone, consisting of many industrial units, has 21 streets designated under containment.

A senior GCC official of Ambattur zone said that though active COVID-19 cases were well below 1,000 at 901, and there were only three to four cases in these streets, they are taking pro-active steps so that the spread of the virus does not go out of hand. The total number of cases were also below the 12,000-mark at 11,188. The official said the authorities do not want to take any chances, as a certain sort of autonomy has been given to the local officials to decide on containment measures.

A senior official of the Health Department of GCC said they had given zonal officials a broad outline, with the flexibility of taking their own decision to designate a street as a containment zone. This was decided on at a recent review meeting. He said unlike barricading of the streets completely, in the new system only a portion of the streets would be blocked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bbgncx/article32781983.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06OCTTH--CORPN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ambattur-zone-has-50-of-chennais-covid-19-containment-areas/article32781984.ece

Guindy Police have booked a case against DMK MP and the party’s women’s wing state secretary, Kanimozhi and 190 party cadre for a candle-light procession on Monday, in violation of prohibitory orders invoked by the city police.

Led by Ms. Kanimozhi, the DMK cadre gathered at Rajiv Gandhi statue in Guindy for a procession condemning the alleged rape and murder of a young Dalit woman in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. Their procession was flagged off by DMK president M.K. Stalin. Near the Saidapet Court complex, they were prevented by police personnel from proceeding towards Raj Bhavan. Police arrested Ms. Kanimozhi and others and took them into a police bus. Later, the police took Ms. Kanimozhi and her party cadre into their custody and detained them at a community hall for a few hours.

Police booked a case against Ms. Kanimozhi with sections 151 (Knowingly joining or continuing in assembly of five or more persons after it has been commanded to disperse), 143 (Punishment for unlawful assembly), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), and two other provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Meanwhile, Guindy police booked a BJP functionary and TV actor Jayalakshmi who came to the spot on Monday with her party supporters and staged a protest demanding justice for the death of a young woman in Cheyyur, Chengalpattu.

348,2020/10/06,"Work on Bhojaraja Nagar subway touches half-way mark, residents complain of slow place","The subway is coming up about 750 metres from the Korukkupet railway station

Around 50% of the work to construct a subway -- at level crossing 11A at Bhojaraja Nagar on Kannan Street in Mint -- has been completed. At present, the work to construct the box-structure beneath the railway tracks is being carried out.

The subway that is coming up some 750 metres from the Korukkupet railway station, is being constructed with funds from the Greater Chennai Corporation. “The railways have been working on the box portion of the subway for at least two years now and will take a few more months to finish. They have spent ₹5 crore so far and have recently sought another ₹1.5 crore. The initial estimate was only ₹2 crore for their portion,” explained a source at the Corporation.

The civic body plans to call for tenders only after land is available for the construction of approach ramps, retaining walls and wells to pump out the water to keep the subway from flooding. “Only recently, we found that an oil main belonging to the Indian Oil Corporation runs through the site. We have to shift that and a Chennai Metrowater main line before handing over the site to a contractor. After shifting these, it will take us close to 12 months to complete our portion of the work,” said another official.

Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar, who recently inspected the subway work, said he would write to the railways and the Corporation asking them to speed up the work.

Meanwhile, residents complained that the work was progressing at a snail’s pace. The proposal to construct a subway had been made nearly two decades ago. It had been included in the Southern Railway's annual plan for 2011-12, but due to issues with funding, it was only taken up a couple of years ago.

“The subway will only bring partial relief since it can, at the most, accommodate cars and mini ambulances. Bigger vehicles will have to wait at the gate,” said Selvaraj, who commutes to Mint daily for work. Residents hope that the promised work to replace nearby level crossings 2A and 2B would bring some relief to them.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/1i1ezz/article32780938.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06OCTTH--Corpnjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/work-on-bhojaraja-nagar-subway-touches-half-way-mark-residents-complain-of-slow-place/article32780940.ece
349,2020/10/06,IIT Madras team’s work recognised at international competition,"U.S. Department of Energy conducted the competition ‘Waves to Water Prize’ to tackle the problem of water supply during disaster-relief scenarios and to remote coastal locations.

The design of a wave energy-based desalination system, made by IIT-Madras along with two foreign institutions, has won the first two stages of the competition for the ‘Waves to Water Prize’, organised by the U.S. Department of Energy.

While the competition mainly focused on designing a system that could be used for supplying potable water in disaster-relief scenarios and to remote coastal locations, the team from IIT-M said they designed it in such a way that it could be scaled up to tackle water shortage in countries such as India.

The team Nalu e Wai (Hawaiian for ‘waves into fresh water’), which created the design, was a collaboration between from IIT-M, University of Hawaii in Honolulu and Uppsala University in Sweden, a statement from IIT-M said.

The team was among 17 to win the design stage, which is the second of the four-stage competition, with total prize money of around $3.3 million, that saw participation from over 100 teams.

Abdus Samad, Professor, Department of Ocean Engineering, IIT-M, said, “The idea is new for portable small-scale wave-powered desalination devices.

350,2020/10/06,"Marina beach out of bounds till Oct. 31, civic body tells HC","‘Govt. has banned access to select places such as beaches’

The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) on Monday told the Madras High Court that Marina beach would remain out of bounds for the general public till October 31 since the State government had extended the limited lockdown till then.

The Second Division Bench of Justices Vineet Kothari and M.S. Ramesh was informed by Additional Advocate General (AAG) S.R. Rajagopal that the government had banned public access to select places, such as beaches and shopping malls, during the ongoing lockdown.

The submission was made during the hearing of a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition, in which the court had taken upon itself the task of ensuring that the beach was maintained neat and clean by the Corporation, besides regulating vendors as well as fishermen.

No bidders

Though the Corporation had come up with a plan to procure and distribute colourful stainless steel pushcarts to about 900 vendors on the beach, the AAG told the Bench that there were no bidders for supplying the carts, despite the Corporation having called for tenders twice.

Stating that it had decided to call the tenders for the third time now, the AAG was confident that at least three firms would definitely participate in the tenders to be opened in November. He urged the court to grant time till then for the Corporation to report the developments.

Explaining the reason for no one having participated in the previous tenders, he said it might be because manufacturing of pushcarts was a labour-intensive work and labourers were not available at all during the complete lockdown since March this year.

In so far as constructing a fish market on 2 acres of land for accommodating the fishermen on the loop road of Marina was concerned, Mr. Rajagopal said the proposal had to be approved at different levels, beginning from the Corporation to the State Cabinet.

He also stated that a report was under preparation for constructing a foot overbridge across the loop road so that the fishermen could carry their catch from the beach to the market using the bridge without having to obstruct motor traffic on the road.

On the plan to connect the loop road from Foreshore Estate with Besant Nagar by repairing a damaged bridge and laying a new road, the AAG said he had no instructions at all. After recording the submissions, the judges adjourned the case to November 11.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/iv869x/article32777325.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06MARINABEACHSHOPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/marina-beach-out-of-bounds-till-oct-31-civic-body-tells-hc/article32777326.ece

Fundamentally, COVID-19 has been the biggest blessing that the internet economy could get in India, according to Deep Kalra, founder and group executive chairman, MakeMyTrip.

“At the end of COVID, we would have jumped from 110 million to 200 million buyers online because there is no other way to order or pay,” he said, addressing over 1,000 delegates at TiECON Chennai 2020, an event that was held virtually for the entrepreneurial community.

Mr. Kalra also spoke about the travel and hospitality industry. “It is going to take time for the travel industry in India to open up. There is a silver bullet, but we don’t know when it is going to come.” He said the future of the travel industry in the short-term was going to be tough. “But I am a firm believer that once we see this through, we are going to see revenge travel. I am very optimistic about the long term; there are no questions about travel being replaced by anything because it is experiential,” he said.

This year, TiECON, organised by The Indus Entrepreneurs, will have sessions in Tamil, too. C.K. Ranganathan, president, TiE Chennai, and chairman and managing director of Cavinkare, said entrepreneurs from across Tamil Nadu would hugely benefit from the sessions. Day one saw a panel discussion on ‘Local to Global: The Chennai Startup path’. The conversation touched upon the need for research and development and innovation, particularly in science and technology, the ability to cater to local as well as global markets, and the role of a supportive ecosystem.

352,2020/10/06,Highways dept. covers drains under construction with steel decks,"Traffic can be allowed on these stretches during the day

The Highways Department has started using steel sheets on city’s arterial roads during construction of stormwater drains to allow unhindered traffic movement. Motorists using the East Coast Road (ECR) and Poonamallee High Road have benefited from this move.

“Though the idea is not new, we do not want to delay work due to the lack of permission for diverting traffic. We are behind schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We can finish the work this monsoon season instead of waiting for the rains to stop,” said an official.

The department is carrying out the work in at least 20 spots in and around the city and these steel decks are being used at three spots.

Another official said that during the time meant for curing of cement concrete, the steel decks will remain in place and traffic will be allowed on these stretches.

The police on Monday arrested a 28-year-old man on charges of blackmailing a woman and extortion by threatening to upload her photographs and videos online.

A first information report was filed by the police after the woman’s husband lodged a complaint at the All Women Police Station, Thirumangalam.

The Madipakkam police have booked a case against a woman inspector and her husband for allegedly cheating a man by promising to get him a job.

Police sources said complainant Sheik Musthafa, a businessman in Madipakkam, was introduced to Arulkumar, who claimed he was working in the HR&CE Department and his wife Kavitha was an inspector in Tiruvannamalai.

357,2020/10/06,Corporation turns Kotturpuram dump into mini-forest,"The lung space was created with 2,000 saplings

The Greater Chennai Corporation has transformed a garbage dump, which had become an eyesore for the public, into a green zone near the Kotturpuram railway station.

Civic officials of the Adyar zone have raised a mini-forest on the land located along the Canal Bank Road on the eastern side of the Mass Rapid Transit System railway station at Kotturpuram.

A resident of Kotturpuram said building debris had been dumped on the land leading to the underground car park. Over the years, residents living along the Canal Bank Road started dumping all their garbage on the vacant land.

Moreover, customers visiting Tasmac shops nearby used to relieve themselves on the land. The residents then petitioned civic officials to take steps to prevent dumping of waste there.

Alby John Varghese, Regional Deputy Commissioner (South) of the Corporation, said many complaints had been received from residents about the land becoming an eyesore.

“After a visit to the site, the civic body tried to prevent dumping of waste by putting up a warning notice board. Then we conceived the idea to turn the vacant land into a green zone using the Miyawaki method. First, the vacant land was ring fenced and the construction debris was removed and replaced by more than four feet of fresh earth.” The greening project, which was inaugurated by Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash in February, had more than 2,000 saplings.

The civic body plans to throw open the green zone for the public once the saplings are well grown and after paving the pavement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hwbeox/article32777170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THKOTTURPURAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corporation-turns-kotturpuram-dump-into-mini-forest/article32777171.ece
358,2020/10/06,Corpn. brings back barricades,"Number of containment streets has gone up from 10 on October 3 to 36 now

The Greater Chennai Corporation has re-introduced COVID-19 containment zones in the city. The civic body, which recently discontinued barricading of streets and houses, declared 10 streets on October 3 as containment zones in the southern parts of the city.

The number of containment streets has now risen to 36, mainly because of a spurt in the number of cases in Ambattur zone.

Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash said the containment strategy was revised mainly depending on the location and need of the place to prevent community spread.

Spike in Ambattur

A senior official of the civic body said of the 36 streets that had been barricaded, 16 were in Ambattur zone and in areas such as Padi, Korattur, Thirumangalam, Anna Nagar West Extension and Mogappair East.

The official said with the public not cooperating as patients removed banners put up outside their houses and moved about freely, the civic body was forced to resort to barricading of streets.

The official said the number of COVID-19 cases remained below the 12,500-mark with Kodambakkam and Anna Nagar accounting for the highest number of cases among the 15 zones.

He said there was a steady increase in positive cases in Ambattur, Alandur and Perungudi.

359,2020/10/06,Farm Acts – unwanted constitutional adventurism,"There is a case to argue that the three Acts have poor legal validity, may be unconstitutional and weaken federalism

The passage of the three Farm Acts by Parliament has led to a constitutional debate. These Acts are: the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Does the Union government have the authority to legislate on what are rightfully the affairs of States? Many States have questioned the constitutional validity of the Farm Acts and are reportedly exploring legal options.

The issue

Agriculture is a State subject in the Constitution, listed as Entry 14 in the State List (List II). This apart, Entry 26 in List II refers to “trade and commerce within the State”; Entry 27 refers to “production, supply and distribution of goods”; and Entry 28 refers to “markets and fairs”. For these reasons, intra-State marketing in agriculture was always considered a legislative prerogative of States.

Also read: ‘Farm laws will benefit corporate firms only’

Seen in this perspective, Parliament’s passage of the Farm Bills was an extraordinary step. For this purpose, the central government invoked Entry 33 in the Concurrent List (List III). Entry 26 and 27 in List II are listed as “subject to the provisions of Entry 33 of List III”. Entry 33 in List III is the following: 33. Trade and commerce in, and the production, supply and distribution of, — (a) the products of any industry where the control of such industry by the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest, and imported goods of the same kind as such products; (b) foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils; (c) cattle fodder, including oilcakes and other concentrates; (d) raw cotton, whether ginned or unginned, and cotton seed; and (e) raw jute.

Amendment and dissent

Entry 33, in its present form, was inserted in List III through the Constitution (Third Amendment) Act, 1954. That its import was significant is clear in the heated constitutional debates around the Amendment. After tabling in the house, the Constitution (Third Amendment) Bill was referred to a Joint Committee. In the Joint Committee, there was severe opposition to the Bill from seven members: N.C. Chatterjee, K.S. Raghavachari, A. Krishnaswamy, Parvathi Krishnan, Bimal Commar Ghosh, V. Venkataramana and Harish Chandra Mathur. In the final report, these members also wrote an important note of dissent.

The contention of the dissent was the following. As per Article 369 in the original version of the Constitution, the responsibility of agricultural trade and commerce within a State was temporarily entrusted to the Union government for a period of five years beginning from 1950. The 1954 Amendment attempted to change this into a permanent feature in the Constitution. But according to the dissenting members, “the Constitution makers did not desire to place matters enumerated in Article 369 in the Concurrent List”. If indeed they were placed in List III, “State autonomy would be rendered illusory and State powers and rights would be progressively pulverised…”, and “…the legislative authority of State legislatures is pro tanto abrogated”. As a result, the Amendment would be “…permanently depriving the State legislatures from effectively exercising their legislative judgement in respect of certain vital matters….”

Parliament discussed the Bill in September 1954. In his opening speech, Minister for Commerce and Industry T.T. Krishnamachari clarified that the Amendment was required because many States were deficit in food production, and the Centre had to “safeguard the interests of the weaker units in the Union”. His point was that it was the adverse food situation in the country that necessitated the Amendment.

But many eminent Opposition members were not impressed, and pointed to the spirit of the dissent note. In their eloquent elaborations, Asoka Mehta and K.K. Basu argued that States such as Bihar, Bombay, Travancore-Cochin and Assam had explicitly opposed the Bill. Basu said that Article 369 was retained as a temporary feature in the Constitution because “the situation in the country [after 1947] was abnormal” and “the food situation was very bad.…” But the Constitution-makers knew that the situation would return to “normal” in a few years. That was why they did not vest the listed powers with the Centre for more than five years. Hence, its conversion into a permanent provision was unwarranted.

Asoka Mehta warned that if the Centre truly wanted control on trade and commerce in States, then, over time, it would also want to have “control over crop planning and cultivation”. Thus, the Bill would lead to “an expanding encroachment on the rights of the States”; “a progressive erosion of State powers”; and “the possibility of side stepping of democratic processes”. According to K.K. Basu, “passage of the Bill would transform the Indian Constitution into a “unitary Constitution” instead of a “federal Constitution” and reduce “all the States’ powers into municipal powers”. A “reactionary legislation” was being introduced as “an innocuous piece of legislation”.

Notwithstanding the strong dissenting voices, the Bill was passed. But history appears to have proven the dissenters right. In September 2020, the same Entry 33 was invoked to usurp the same powers of the States that the dissenters feared would be taken away.

What the judiciary said

In many of its judgments after 1954, the Supreme Court of India has upheld the legislative powers of States in intra-State agricultural marketing. Most notable was the ruling of the five-judge Constitution Bench in I.T.C. Limited vs. Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) and Others, 2002. The Tobacco Board Act, 1975 had brought the development of the tobacco industry under the Centre. However, Bihar’s APMC Act continued to list tobacco as an agricultural produce. In this case, the question was if the APMC in Monghyr could charge a levy on ITC for the purchase of unprocessed tobacco leaves from growers. An earlier judgment had held that the State APMC Act will be repugnant to the Central Act, and hence was ultra vires.

But the Constitution Bench upheld the validity of the State APMC Act, and ruled that (a) market fees can be charged from ITC under the State APMC Act; (b) State laws become repugnant only if the State and Centre enact laws on the same subject matter under an Entry in List III; and (c) in those cases outside List III, one has to first examine if the subject matter was an exclusive entry under List I or List II, and only after determining this can one decide on the dominant legislation that would prevail. In the case of the Farm Acts of 2020, the applicable points are (a) and (c). With regard to (a), States could continue to charge mandi taxes from private markets anywhere in the notified area regardless of the Central Act. With regard to (c), the State legislation should prevail as agriculture is an exclusive subject matter — Entry 14 – in List II.

In summary, first, it was unwise on the part of the Centre to use Entry 33 in List III to push the Farm Bills. Such adventurism weakens the spirit of federal cooperation that India needs in this hour of crisis. Second, agriculture is exclusively a State subject. Everything that is ancillary or subsidiary to an exclusive subject in List II should also fall under the exclusive legislative purview of States. Most importantly, Entry 28 in List II — i.e., “markets and fairs” — is not subject to Entry 33 in List III. In short, there appears to be a strong case to reasonably argue that the Farm Acts have poor legal validity, if not being outrightly unconstitutional.

Insolvency resolution

Nowhere in the article, “Transforming business and the insolvency system” (Editorial page, October 5), have the writers mentioned even a line about the huge haircuts (sacrifices) lenders have had to endure in the process of insolvency resolution in India.

For example, in a prominent case involving a leading steel manufacturer, the promoters came back with a bag full of funds that was equal to the loans plus interest.

Generally, the misdeeds of the original directors are forgotten. Special courts should be established and banks given the freedom to value the assets of the borrower company and sell them.

Language in India

It is a travesty of truth to say that English is an Indian language (OpEd, “English is an Indian language”, October 5), and the writer, as a parliamentarian, may be saying this more out of his eagerness to please certain political constituents. English is only a link language. Take for example, those from Kerala; they are able to find jobs anywhere in India due to the three-language formula. I would like to point out that the Food Corporation of India was set up in Chennai in the early 1960s by then Food Minister C. Subramanian and the line is that it was to provide more jobs especially for those from Tamil Nadu to work anywhere in India. But in reality, those from Kerala reaped the benefit due to their command over Hindi. Had Tamil Nadu adopted the three-language system, it would have led the State elsewhere.

The issue of teaching Hindi in non-Hindi speaking States needs a relook. We are a Bengali-speaking family living in Karnataka and I help my granddaughter with her eighth grade Hindi lessons. Her classmates and playmates do not speak Hindi; nor is it at home. Not having any exposure to the spoken language and at the same time being required to study a highly stylised literary language from the textbook, I find the girl and her classmates struggling to find the relevance of what is being taught. Having lived and worked for three decades in Uttar Pradesh, I know Hindi well and I wonder what the prescribed texts seek to achieve. It helps to learn Hindi, but what needs to be taught is a practical version of the language which is close to what is spoken on the street. It should not be made mandatory for the Board examinations.

One should read George Orwell’s essay ‘A Hanging’ at least once in a lifetime for two reasons. One, the candid and chilling manner in which Orwell describes the plight of a poor man put to death by hanging during the British Raj. Second, the flow of the English language which makes a reader feel it is live. In the beauty of the language, it is clear that English binds people across the nation.

361,2020/10/06,‘Varmaa’ movie review: Bala’s version is shorter and an insipid remake,"The filmmaker seems to be totally detached and uninterested — either with the subject material or the actors — resulting in a mess that is already messed up

When the announcement came that Bala was going to remake that film, it was celebrated by a section of film buffs who may or may not have liked the Telugu original, but were remotely interested because of the name attached to it and the interpretation the filmmaker — traditionally known for dealing with violent characters — would give to a movie which could well be seen as a spiritual sister to his own Sethu. Pardon the cynicism, but I half-expected Bala to give a redemptive arc to this morally-wretched universe, and suspected it to be even more violent — in the manner in which it treats the heroine and everyone except the titular character — and therefore more “problematic”.

Also Read: Get 'First Day First Show', our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here

But the Bala Cut, as it would come to be known, is surprisingly cold and lifeless — even by the standards set by Adithya Varma — and edits out the dramatic bits of the Telugu original, only limiting to its plot points. The filmmaker seems to be totally detached and uninterested — either with the subject material or the actors — here and gives a reinterpretation to his own Sethu, with regard to the way the heroine is written and coached to perform. Megha Vasudevan (Megha Chowdhury) is the most submissive of all versions put together; she comes from an upper caste family from Kerala, wears traditional clothes and flowers in her hair, in the introduction scene, and is God-fearing (sings ‘Harivarasanam’ before switching to ‘Jimikki Kammal’). In short, she is the Abitha Kujalambal (from Sethu) that the original failed to define in the first place. She, like Abitha of that film, is possessed and harassed by the hero.

In my review of Adithya Varma, I had written: “What has also remained a mystery is the redeeming quality of Preeti/Meera towards the climax stretch. What is so great or pure about Adithya Varma that any woman would put up with?” Varmaa, too, does not seem to broach that train of thought. In that sense, Adithya Varma works much better as a film than this — whether it is performances or music.

Just asking Varmaa released legally on three platforms in India: The Ally, Shreyas Media and Shemaroo Entertainment, and the audience can watch it via pay-per-view. It is priced at ₹140. I logged onto The Ally through my laptop. Everything went smooth until I got a message on the landing page which said: “Anti Capture Service application not installed.”

From what I understand, it is an extension on Google Chrome which protects the screen from being recorded, and which I did install — this was after the payment gateway was successful. The website asked, or rather, forced me to download and install a third party application (AntiCaptureService) — which is free of cost — in order to access Varmaa. I was sceptical and fuming because a) it is a third party app, so there is no guarantee to your data being safe and b) I absolutely had zero interest. After installing the said app, I tried to refresh the page to a message that read: “Anti Capture Service detected capture program Radeonsettings.” The last time I checked, Radeon.exe was a driver for the graphic card.

If you are so concerned about your movie landing on a pirated website — which it did hours before its actual release — then why release at all on a streaming platform? Why would you arm twist the audience to install a third party app onto their systems for a movie which you, as a producer, scrapped it in the first place and later decided to monetise from it? I eventually watched the film on The Ally’s mobile application.

One of the things that became a subject of discussion when that film released was how that guy fat shames his girlfriend’s friends, making crude jokes about them. That entire portion is removed in Varmaa, but it does have its fair share of sexist dialogues. In one scene, we see that guy calling out someone for “objectifying women” and in the same breath, uses a derogatory word (in Tamil for women) to refer to that person, countering himself.

But what Bala tries and gets it marginally right, unlike other filmmakers, is the additional space and weight given to the domestic helper Bhavani (played by Easwari Rao). This seemingly insignificant character is there in all versions, but is made into a joke thanks to that guy. But Bala humanises her, making her the moral epicentre of this film — not to the effect he would have liked, but it still is an interesting addition.

That guy is entitled and a spoilt brat because of the privileges he enjoys from his family and his immediate circle, who merely exist and whose existence would raise concern outside of the film’s universe. Bhavani is the one and the only one who stands her ground and who is also responsible for the person that guy turned out to be. She is the mother he never had, perhaps explaining his man-child issues. In fact, when she says it was she who raised him, he turns pale slapping her with: “Didn’t you get paid?” He is that sort of a guy.

The one common denominator in all the retellings of that film is the opening card which begins with: “No birds, animals were harmed during the making.” It should ideally read as: “No birds, animals were harmed — only humans, particularly women, and film journalists.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/am2wk/article32783759.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Varma,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/varmaa-movie-review/article32783760.ece

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is holding discussions with various religious organisations and he will soon take a decision on reopening places of worship in the State, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said on Monday.

Mr. Raut said this when some reporters pointed out that restaurants have been allowed to operate again with their capacity not exceeding 50% or as prescribed by local authorities, but temples have not been reopened in the State.

“The Chief Minister has maintained from the beginning that things will be unlocked in a phased manner...you can impose 50% restrictions on restaurants while reopening them, but it is not possible in the case of temples,” he said.

“The states chief minister is speaking to organisations representing all religions. Soon, the chief minister will take a decision on it,” Raut said.

The Rajya Sabha member also said the decision on the number of seats to be contested by the Shiv Sena in the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections is expected to be taken in a day or two.

“Discussion is on about contesting the Bihar polls.

Our people in Bihar want us to fight 50 seats. But, we are saying that we should contest 30 to 40 seats. A decision on it will be taken today or tomorrow,” he said.

Asked if the Shiv Sena will field a candidate against former Bihar director general of police Gupteshwar Pandey (if he contests), Raut cryptically said, “Keep watching.”

“I will go to Bihar. Will answer this when I will go there, he added.

Pandey, while heading the Bihar Police force, had pitched for a CBI probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajputs death case.

363,2020/10/06,Sushant Singh Rajput death case | Mumbai police to take action against fake social media accounts,"FIR has been registered against those account holders, says official.

Claiming they have been vindicated by the AIIMS report on the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, which termed it suicide, the Maharashtra government and the Mumbai police have said they will take action against fake social media accounts that trolled and defamed the Mumbai police in this case.

Maharashtra Home Minister and senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Anil Deshmukh too demanded an apology from the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for defaming and insulting the State and its police. He asked former CM Devendra Fadnavis, party in-charge for Bihar election, whether he will campaign for Bihar’s former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey, who defamed Maharashtra in the case.

“Several social media account holders are trolling the Mumbai Police Commissioner on different platforms like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook and are using abusive language against him and the force. Hence, an FIR has been registered against those account holders under Section 67 of the IT Act. Most of these accounts are fake and we will be taking action against all those fake account holders,” said Rashmi Karandikar, DCP, Cyber Crime, Mumbai police.

“Another FIR has been registered against culprits who used a morphed image of the official Twitter account of the Mumbai Police Commissioner. We have started the probe in both matters,” said Ms. Karandikar.

The Mumbai Commissioner of Police too had pointed to fake social media accounts being used to run propaganda against the force. According to sources, over 80,000 such accounts have been identified from foreign countries for promoting conspiracy and targeting the State government, especially the Mumbai police.

Mr. Deshmukh, addressing a press conference on Wednesday, slammed the BJP for running anti-Maharashtra propaganda under the guise of seeking justice for Rajput. Citing a report from the University of Michigan, which analysed the Twitter trends and social media posts in the case, he said the report pinpointed the BJP and certain news channels for running a propaganda campaign against the State and the Mumbai police.

“The BJP not only tried to defame the Maharashtra police but also the State. It is sad that Devendra Fadnavis, who led the Home Department for past five years, questioned the efficiency of Mumbai police. It was a plot against Maharashtra. An attempt to defame the State,” said Mr. Deshmukh.

He said Mr. Pandey was going to fight the election in Bihar. “I want to ask Devendra Fadnavis whether he will campaign for Pandey who insulted Maharashtra?”

“People who try to defame the State and insulted Maharashtra must apologise to the people of Maharashtra. If they don’t, people will not forgive them. Those who defamed the State will be probed through cyber cell of the State police,” he said, demanding the CBI to make public the report on the death of the actor.

“SSR controversy was nothing but a conspiracy to gain political mileage for Bihar election. It was done by one political party,” he said.

The Maharashtra Congress too welcomed the action against fake social media profiles for spreading propaganda. “Soon, will share very crucial info to government with respect to social media accounts which were solely generated by the BJP IT team to promote conspiracy theory in the SSR case and defamed Maharashtra,” said Sachin Sawant, State Congress general secretary and spokesperson, adding that he will visit the Mumbai CP on Wednesday morning with proof against the IT cell of the BJP.

The BJP said the State’s Home Minister must not make such statements until the final report from the CBI is prepared. “The BJP and Devendra Fadnavis are ready for any sort of inquiry. The ruling party should not give threats, but do inquiry if he really wants,” said BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/q3x2jc/article31222547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1BMPARAMBIRSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/firs-against-social-media-accounts-for-trolling-mumbai-police-commissioner/article32780196.ece

Two fire brigade personnel were injured on Monday during the operation. They were rushed to hospital and later discharged after treatment.

It was initially tagged as a ‘level-3’ (major) fire, but later escalated to ‘level-4’ (massive), they said.

Seventeen fire vehicles, as many jumbo water tankers and three turn-table ladders have been pressed into service.

Firefighters are on the spot and efforts are still underway to douse the flames, a fire brigade official said.

The cause of the blaze was yet to be ascertained, he said.

As the building has godowns housing garments, cutlery and chemicals, thick smoke was emanating from it, making it difficult to put out the inferno, another fire official earlier said.

He said this is probably the first time after the 2012 blaze in the state secretariat that a fire fighting operation has gone on for so long in the metropolis.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ejx6rz/article32779254.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDMUMBAIFIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-market-fire-yet-to-be-doused-even-after-40-hours/article32779255.ece
365,2020/10/06,"COVID-19 | If patient dies due to negligence, family should get compensation, says HC","The matter is adjourned till November 23.

The Bombay High Court on Monday said if the State government accepted that victims of COVID-19 had died due to culpable negligence, their family members should be entitled to compensation.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by BJP MLA Ashish Shelar.

The PIL raised an issue about the proper management of bodies of COVID-19 victims, which is also pending adjudication before the Supreme Court. It said that hospitals, including Sion hospital, should have considerably large areas for a mortuary hall and a post-mortem hall for dealing with bodies. The PIL sought a direction to the State government to set up a committee to look into this. The court directed Mr. Shelar to suggest additional measures that could be adopted by the State for better management of bodies in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

An additional affidavit was filed by Mr. Shelar on July 10 in which he had referred to 11 instances of death of patients, either at State-run hospitals or hospitals operated by various municipal corporations, amid the pandemic. According to him, such instances would suggest culpable negligence on the part of those responsible for running the hospitals.

The court on Monday said, “If the instances referred to by Mr. Shelar were true and the State accepts the allegations of the petitioner that there has been culpable negligence, the unfortunate victim’s family members should be entitled to compensation.”

One of the 11 instances is that of a 82-year-old woman who went missing from the Jalgaon civil hospital on June 2 and was later found dead in the toilet of the hospital.

Assistant government pleader Kedar Dighe said that all 11 instances did not belong to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation-run hospitals and that in some cases, State-run hospitals were responsible.

The court then said, “We thought at least for these instances in which people have died due to negligence, some mechanism be devised by the State. It is the State’s responsibility. We are just awakening it.”

The Bench said, “We make it clear that even if all the hospitals where the unfortunate deaths occurred were not run by the State, nothing would prevent the State from accessing information from the authority in charge of administration thereof and placing on record all relevant factual details and particulars.”

The matter is adjourned till November 23.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rgzlfh/article32780656.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MAHARASHTRAKARAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/if-covid-19-patient-dies-due-to-negligence-family-should-get-compensation-says-hc/article32777386.ece

A single judge Bench of Justice A.K. Menon was hearing the suit filed by Ms. Chadha through advocate Saveena Bedi Sachar seeking damages of ₹1.1 crore. On September 19, Ms. Ghosh gave an interview titled, ‘Anurag Kashyap Opened His Zip & Pushed it Inside-Payal Ghosh’ and ‘Sensational Things That Payal Ghosh Told ABN.’

The plaint said, “The claims made by Ms. Ghosh in the video are not only false, frivolous and vexatious but has also been done with an intent to cause damage to the immense goodwill.”

It sought an apology and an interim injunction for Ms. Ghosh to withdraw her statement, video, articles and tweets in relation to Ms. Chadha.

368,2020/10/06,Hyundai Grand i10 Nios: The turbo version is a lot more capable and effortless,"This car is currently the fastest accelerating mass-market hatchback on sale in India

Launched last year, the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios comes across as a practical, sophisticated and well-rounded hatchback for your everyday use. Hyundai has added some zing into the mix with an all-new turbo variant. So, is the Nios Turbo exciting enough?

There are a few minor details that help you tell the Nios Turbo apart from the regular hatchback. The trapezoidal grille is blacked out and features a ‘Turbo’ badge which is besides the one on the tailgate. The projector headlamps, LED DRLs, and 15-inch alloys are shared with the fully-loaded Asta variant.

In the Turbo, the reverse gear is positioned besides the first gear, as opposed to being besides the fourth gear in the standard Nios. As with the standard car, the interiors are spacious and nicely put together with high-quality plastics; it remains a practical cabin with a very user-friendly layout. In terms of equipment, the Turbo packs in auto climate control, a part-digital instrument cluster, an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, reverse camera, projector headlamps, and wireless charging. However, it misses out on some features like a push-button start and keyless entry.

Specifications Length (mm) 3805mm

Width (mm) 1680mm

Height (mm) 1520mm

Wheelbase (mm) 2450mm

Engine 998cc, 3-cyls, turbo-petrol

Power 100hp at 6000rpm

Torque 172Nm at 1500-4000rpm

Gearbox 5-speed manual

Tank size (lts) 37 litres

Tyres (F|R) 175/60 R15

Moving to the engine, the Nios Turbo uses the same 998cc, three-cylinder turbo-petrol engine as the Aura Turbo, and makes an identical 100hp and 172Nm of torque. With a sub-1-tonne kerb weight, power-to-weight and torque-to-weight ratios are better than any other affordable petrol hatchback in the market today. The engine is smooth and refined, but it isn’t completely vibration-free when compared to its 1.2-litre four-cylinder naturally aspirated counterpart. When spun faster, this motor does get a bit thrummy, although the sound isn’t excessively loud.

Those used to driving non-turbo cars will need to get accustomed to this turbo petrol engine since on-tap responses are not as sharp as a naturally aspirated engine. It is above 1,800rpm where the turbo starts singing, and there is a nice second wind of power once the tachometer needle crosses 3,000rpm. Between 2,000-5,000rpm, the engine feels very gutsy and far more capable than the 1.2-litre petrol. While it isn’t as free-revving as Volkswagen’s 1.0-litre TSI motor, it will spin to 6,600rpm in the first three gears, maxing out at 101kph in second gear and at 164kph in third gear, which goes to show how tall-geared this version is. Flat-out, it will even go on to hit a top speed of 183kph.

The Nios Turbo is currently the fastest accelerating mass-market hatchback on sale in India. It out-accelerates the Volkswagen Polo 1.0 TSI (the previous fastest) to 100kph and it even reaches 160kph a full second quicker.

Even through the gears, the Nios is quicker. The 5-speed manual gearbox is an absolute delight to use with butter-smooth shifts. The clutch and steering is light, too. However, road grip from the skinny tyres isn’t very confidence inspiring. Like the standard car, the Turbo’s brakes offer a strong initial bite.

Despite being a spruced-up version, this car retains all of Nios’ strengths like its sophisticated but practical interiors, an absorbent low-speed ride quality, and its easy-to-drive nature.

But those who love to drive will be left wanting for a more engaging driving experience to match the added performance, and the ₹95,000-1,00,000 premium that this turbo version commands over a comparable 1.2-litre petrol variant seems a bit too hard to justify. Sharper driving manners and sportier looks would have made the Nios Turbo a purer hot hatch, and a more compelling proposition.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/6s6dgv/article32783955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07MPHyundai1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/hyundai-grand-i10-nios-the-turbo-version-is-a-lot-more-capable-and-effortless/article32783959.ece
369,2020/10/06,No ambivalence here — all is fair in love and T20 cricket,"Debates about ‘Mankading’ are given a fresh airing every season

We no longer use the racially offensive term ‘chinaman’ in cricket. Instead we say ‘left-arm wrist-spinner’. Perhaps it is time we found another term for ‘mankading’, the act of a bowler running out a non-striker who backs up too far and thus gains time and space. For long, the act has been considered disreputable.

After Vinoo Mankad, the great Indian all-rounder, ran out Australia’s Bill Brown thus, Don Bradman defended him. So did the batsman himself. Sunil Gavaskar has suggested that a batsman dismissed in this perfectly legal manner should be said to be ‘browned’; after all, the onus is on him to ensure he does not gain an unfair advantage.

And yet. And yet.

Spirit of the game

Every season, someone somewhere does a ‘mankad’ or a ‘brown’ (depending on your preference), and old debates are given a fresh airing. What is legal, however, need not necessarily be moral. There is something called the ‘spirit’ of the game — somewhat ambiguous and undefined, but clearly recognisable when one sees it being breached on the field.

“Giving houseroom to our ambivalence is part of our human complexity,” writes the sage of the game, Mike Brearley in his new book, Spirit of Cricket. The spirit, he says, is usually spoken of in a patronising tone: “I felt it had been enlisted by snobbery.”

When the MCC World Cricket Committee discussed the issue of ‘mankading’, sympathy was almost entirely with the fielding side.

All the arguments in support of the bowler are valid, of course. Legally, that is. After all, bowlers, up against flat wickets, powerful bats, and shortened boundaries often struggle, despite the rule-makers’ attempts to right the balance now and then. The batsman does not need extra help.

One of the charms of cricket is that it is a game played on parallel lines — within the laws and within the spirit. If everything were written out, every situation anticipated, something of its soul would be lost. Should a batsman walk when he knows he has snicked the ball or wait for the umpire’s call? Should a catch be claimed when a fielder knows the ball has touched the ground? Cricket is a team game with significant individual moments; the overall ethics a team displays might be different from an individual’s personal ethics.

The Decision Review System (DRS) has taken some of the individual’s decisions out of his hands, yet players show us who they are and what they stand for in the manner in which they react when faced with a choice between being right and being ethical.

Following instructions

When R. Ashwin decided not to ‘mankad’ Aaron Finch in the IPL, was he following his coach Ricky Ponting’s advice? Ponting had told the bowler before the start of the tournament to desist. Had the team lost the match thanks to a big score from Finch, how would bowler and coach have reconciled ethics with pragmatism?

Last year, when Ashwin ran out Jos Buttler in similar fashion, there was an element of entrapment, and that put off even supporters of the ‘it’s legal, after all’ school. Ashwin paused in his bowling action — the law doesn’t focus just on the batsman backing up, but also on ‘the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball..’ That is sometimes a close call.

Brearley admits in his book after discussing many cases: “I had changed my mind. I was no longer inclined to view (‘mankading’) as unethical or against the spirit of cricket.” That pronouncement has as much authority as anything Bradman said.

But it is not a stand I find easy to take. Perhaps it is because I have played just enough cricket to be starry-eyed but not enough to be sensible! When I see a bowler ‘mankading’ a batsman, I feel bad. Maybe it’s the snobbery Brearley talks about, a cousin of the kind of condescension that leads to a feeling of superiority.

But there is a bridge that can be thrown across the two points of view. It stems from the conviction that T20 is not a shorter form of First Class or Test cricket, but a sport that despite being created from a rib of the longer game, is quite different.

Shift in perceptions

Approaches are different, techniques are different, ‘success’ means different things to the individual batsman or bowler.

Morals can be different too. What is looked down upon in the longer formats need not be so in T20. Thus ‘mankading’, which might be against the spirit in a First Class match, would be not just welcome, but actually necessary in a T20 game.

But what of the term ‘mankading’? As Brearley writes, “Perhaps there is something subliminally racist (in it): named after an Indian, the action was felt to be un-Christian.” Let us run it out of the lexicon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/o47227/article26638246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26Ashwins,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/no-ambivalence-here-all-is-fair-in-love-and-t20-cricket/article32785954.ece
370,2020/10/06,The waterlily business is blooming,"Waterlilies are seeing a boom in recent years. Now, fuelled by the downtime triggered by COVID-19, there is a new breed of hobbyists growing and selling these flowers

It is a trend, says Thane-based, aquatic gardener Somnath Pradeep Pal, discussing the increasing worldwide fascination for waterlilies.

Somnath was featured as the Hybridiser of The Month in the July issue of the International Waterlily and Water Gardening Society (IWGS) Journal. With over 20 years of experience, he is now in the news for his deep purple lily called Rishi, which has a petal count of 50 and another 70-petal flower called Painted Dream.

While hobbyists are aware of the possibilities in growing and propagating waterlilies, their success is roping in others, he says. The other factor, according to him, is “the idea that a garden is incomplete without aquatic plants is drawing home gardeners to have a water corner”. And the fact that the flowers pose a scope for additional income for small-scale growers.

“Aquatic plants are a promising vertical segment of gardening. Their promising business scope attracts numerous small growers and high-end horticultural investors as well,” says Kochi-based JM Jacob who founded Miniature Gardening Expertise Society of India three years ago and is the administrator for several social media communities on gardening.

The slowdown triggered by COVID-19 does not seem to have impacted the growing interest in aquatic gardening. In fact it has spiked it, says Varun Kumar, an engineering student who has joined his family’s waterlily venture at Dharmapuri in Tamil Nadu. He, along with his father Muthu Kumar, is the administrator of Facebook group Waterlilies and Lotus India. Varun says that there are as many as 10 groups on social media dedicated to water gardening with some groups having a membership of nearly 10,000.

“We were a small community but the last 18 months have seen a tremendous growth in membership,” says Jacob. His community called Aquatic Gardens on Facebook has seen 10,000 entries in the last year. He attributes the increase in numbers to awareness created through workshops, seminars and educational discussions across cities. Jacob compares this boom to people’s interest in orchids 15 years ago.

Bangalore-based grower and seller Indira Shankar says that the Internet has facilitated the commercial aspect of the hobby. A licensed importer, she has been in the field for the past 30 years. “Earlier, we grew native varieties; but now, with awareness, there are almost 2,000 registered hybrids to choose from,” she says.

The last five to 10 years, according to Maryland-based Kelly Billing, a water garden consultant and a member of the IWGS committee, have seen an international awakening. When she entered the field in 1986, very few companies were into hybridisation. The hybridised varieties, she points out, allow waterlilies and lotuses to be grown in small containers and bowls.

She explains, “New plants are on the rise. Somnath is creating vibrant new cultivars.” Hybridisers are working on even smaller plants for small apartments says Kelly who finds growing these “is part of one’s soul.”

Southern States in India that have good weather conditions and plenty of natural water bodies lead in waterlily cultivation but Maharashtra, Odisha and Gujarat also have many growers.

“Out of 100 who join the Aquatic Gardens group, 30 are from Kerala. Almost 70% of the plants are bought by growers from there,” says Jacob. Aquatic Gardens held the first all India Aquatic Gardening Expertise Meet and conference at Alappuzha in 2019 in Kerala.

“Every buyer is a seller of the future,” says Prasanta Kumar Das, a grower, hybridiser and aquatic venture knowledge consultant from Odisha and administrator of Aquatic Gardens. “Educating the beginners is essential for sustaining the hobby,” says Prasanta

Neethu Suneesh from Muvattupuzha bought her first waterlily bulb for ₹100. When the native variety blossomed, she delved into the subject and learned that hybrid varieties can be grown in small tubs on balconies and terraces. She bought her first hybrid bulb for ₹1,000 and this provided her with tubers in the next one month, which she could multiply. “I now have 65 hybrids, all growing on my terrace,” says Neethu.

Jacob explains the commercial viability of waterlily farming. “The waterlily’s propagation and rearing phase is very short compared to other ornamental plants like orchids, adenium or succulents. A grower might get up to 20 to 25 tubers from a mother plant to retail for anywhere between ₹1,000 to 5,000. A profit of a lakh is possible in a few months.” But he admits this may result in an imbalance between buyers and sellers and that a market-driven monopoly by breeders and traders may lead to popularity of only certain varieties.

Summing up the trend Kelly says, “There has been an uptick in interest while people have been home. Perhaps it slowed things down enough for people to reconnect with Nature.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/u078jc/article32783315.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpwaterlillyjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/growing-water-lilies-is-the-latets-trend-in-aquatic-gardening/article32783318.ece
371,2020/10/06,"Rayalaseema scheme must, says Jagan","In a letter to Union Jal Shakti Minister, he pitches for keeping control of NSRC head regulator with A.P.

While making a strong pitch for providing water to the drought-prone Rayalaseema districts by scaling up the irrigation projects, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has said the State has no option but to take up the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme to utilise 3 tmcft per day from the Srisailam Reservoir (at level below 881 feet) to supplement its projects.

In a letter to Union Minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekawat, the Chief Minister said, “Telangana, with a mutually-agreed share of 299 tmcft, has a facility to draw 3 tmcft per day at a level of 800 feet, while A.P., with an agreed allocation of 512 tmcft, does not have the capacity to draw water into Pothireddypadu at a water level below 881 feet.”

“The State will take up the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme and improve the canal network, consisting of TGP, SRBC, GNSS and KC Canal. There is neither any proposal to draw water more than what is allocated to A.P. nor is there any plan to have new storage,” said Mr. Reddy.

Contrary to Telangana’s claims, the combined State had projected the demands of all the projects in the three regions before the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal-I, which included extension of the Tungabhadra Project Left Bank Canal, Bhima Project Left Canal and Upper Krishna Project Right Bank Canal, which was adjudicated. Consequently, 17.84 tmcft was allocated to the Jurala project on equitable distribution principle in 1976, he added.

The Chief Minister said the drought-prone areas of Rayalaseema and Nellore and Prakasam districts were dependent on the Srisailam project for their drinking, industrial and irrigation needs.

“In contrast, Mahabubnagar, Nalgonda and Rangareddy districts of Telangana are able to irrigate more than 30% of the command area with 142 tmcft,” he said.

“Water can be drawn for the Rayalaseema LI scheme through the Pothireddypadu head regulator when the level in Srisailam is above +854 ft starting with 7,000 cusecs. The full capacity of 44,000 cusecs can be drawn only when water level is above +881 ft. The FRL is +885 ft in Srisailam, which will be available for a short period of 15-20 days in a year going by the last 10-year record,” he said.

Citing the arguments of the State in the KWDT, the Chief Minister said transfer of water outside the river basin was legal within the riparian States.

‘The anomaly’

He also observed that the arrangement of keeping the right side power house of Nagarjuna Sagar and Srisailam with A.P. and the left side power house with Telangana as per their geographical and territorial location served no purpose as “Telangana generates power at 796 ft itself without any consideration to the basic needs of the six districts of A.P., or the drinking water needs of Chennai, which are met only at 881ft.”

“On the contrary, to the advantage of Telangana, the control of Nagarjunasagar dam is with Telangana though the head regulator of NS Right Canal and right half of the dam are in the geographical territory of A.P. This is resulting in A.P. not getting its share and timely releases of water even after issue of release order by the KRMB,” he said.

“To correct the anomaly, the control of NSRC head regulator should be kept under A.P. control as NSLC head regulator is under the control of Telangana to ensure brotherly relationship between the States. Similarly, power generation in Srisailam on both sides should be undertaken only after the requirements of the six districts of A.P. and Chennai are fully met,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/andhra-pradesh-assembly/rwqr7l/article32786209.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07VJPG4-PM,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/andhra-pradesh-assembly/rayalaseema-scheme-must-says-jagan/article32786210.ece
372,2020/10/06,Centre to fix jurisdiction of river boards,"Meeting called to resolve differences between A.P. and Telangana on sharing Krishna, Godavari waters

The Centre will determine the jurisdictions of the Krishna and Godavari river management boards (KRMB and GRMB), Union Water Resources Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said on Tuesday.

He was speaking after convening an apex council meeting involving the Centre, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the second since 2016. The meeting is primarily to resolve the conflict between the two States over executing irrigation projects and sharing water from the Krishna and Godavari rivers.

The key points on the agenda at Thursday’s meeting which was convened via videoconference are: jurisdiction of the KRMB and GRMB, submission of Detailed Project Reports (DPR) of new projects by the two governments for appraisal and sanction by the Apex Council, establishing a mechanism to determine the share of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the Krishna and Godavari waters, and shifting the headquarters of the Krishna River Management Board to Andhra Pradesh.

“The Centre will go ahead with notifying the jurisdiction of both KRMB & GRMB. Telangana Chief Minister dissented on this, but as per the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, no consensus is needed. Both Chief Ministers agreed to submit the DPRs of all the projects taken up by their States. Their technical appraisal will be done in the shortest possible timeframe,” said Mr. Shekhawat.

The headquarters of the KRMB would be located in Andhra Pradesh, he added.

With regards to sharing of river waters, the Telangana Chief Minister agreed to withdraw the case filed in Supreme Court, to allow the Centre to refer water sharing issues to the Krishna Godavari tribunal.

Regarding the sharing of Godavari waters, both the States were asked to send in their requests to the Centre so that it could refer them to the tribunal, a statement from the Water Resources Ministry said.

373,2020/10/06,Time to celebrate,"Hooray, hooray, it’s a happy happy day! Why? Cos, my grandparents are coming.

Gooooood morning, peeps. What an amazing day it is today! Beautiful! Gorgeous! The sun is shining and the birds are chirping. Actually, that’s not true; it looks like it’s about to start pouring any second now, and the only bird I can see is this not-too-bright pigeon that keeps crashing into my bedroom window. But it sure feels like a sun-shining-bird-chirping day. Want to know why? No, online school has not been cancelled indefinitely. No, the pesky brother has not been given away to a travelling circus. No, my parents have not said yes to a second dog yet.

My grandparents are coming. Now, for those of you who live with your grandparents, that doesn’t seem like such a big deal. But, for kids like me, who see their grandparents once or twice a year, it is a pretty huge deal.

On your side always

When grandparents visit, your parents aren’t the oldest grown-ups in the house. Their parents are. Which means, technically, you don’t really have to listen to everything your parents say. You can just do what your grandparents tell you and, because they haven’t seen you in nine months, they’re going to be saying really nice things like ‘Of course, you can have ice cream for dinner!’

Speaking of dessert, when grandparents visit, it’s like living in Willie Wonka’s chocolate factory. But filled with the best Indian sweets. Gulab jamuns, badam cakes, pitchers of payasam. If I tell my mother, I feel like having something sweet, she’ll give me a bowl of watermelon. But not my paati. She’ll whip up a batch of something delicious and sticky and sweet before you know it.

Grandparents also know when to take your side — which is always! When you have your grandparents on your side, you get to stay up a little later, sleep in a little longer and skip math tuition. And your parents can’t say anything because, just like you have to listen to your parents, they have to listen to theirs.

But really, the best thing of all is that grandparents always have time for you. They’re never too tired to play UNO with you, never shoo you away from the room because they’re on a Zoom call, and are always ready to play Candy Crush or Subway Surfer. (Hey, they like old-school games okay?) And best of all? They never lecture. EVER.

I know all of this makes me sound super spoiled. But it’s just once a year, okay? And considering how awful 2020 has been so far, a little bit of spoiling is okay, if you ask me. Now, excuse me while I go make some space in my stomach for those badam cakes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/pu5c55/article32779402.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SU-Hindu-YW---Bug-Boy---October-2020-I,https://www.thehindu.com/children/time-to-celebrate/article32779403.ece

Union Minister for Shipping for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari will dedicate the flyover through video conferencing from New Delhi while Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy and Minister for Public Works will attend a function to mark the inaugural at Villianur.

The opening of overbridge will considerably ease traffic congestion in fast growing suburban town of Villianur.

The work on the bridge, which commenced in 2016, got stuck mid-way after nine persons approached the Madras High Court seeking more for the land they provided for constructing the bridge at the Arumpathapuram railway gate.

Mr Namassivayam told The Hindu that the project got sanctioned during fag end of UPA-II and construction started two years later. “It is one of the few infrastructure projects which Centre agreed to bear the entire cost for. Around Rs 30 crore was spent to realise the project,” he said.

379,2020/10/06,Announcement on reopening of schools draws flak in Karaikal,"‘Students must be immunised first’

The announcement by the Puducherry government on reopening of schools from October 8 has apparently caused consternation among a section of parents in Karaikal district.

Teachers in 68 government and private high and higher secondary schools in Karaikal district have received instructions from the School Education Department for attending duty on alternate days to clarify the doubts of students.

“There will be no regular classes. Students who wish to get their doubts clarified by their teachers will be coming to school with the consent of their parents. The teachers have been asked to make sure that there are not more than 10 students in each class,” said Alli, Chief Educational Officer of Karaikal District

The teachers are already engaging the students through online classes. Based on the outcome of the initiative, the students of Class IX and XI will be allowed to attend schools in batches of 10, Ms. Alli said.

The announcement by the Puducherry School Education Departments states that schools in containment zones will continue to remain closed.

In the backdrop of the Tamil Nadu Government cancelling its earlier order on re-opening of schools from the start of October and the Union Home Ministry issuing guidelines for States and Union Territories on re-opening of schools from October 15, the announcement of the Puducherry Government to open the schools at an earlier date has not gone down well with public welfare organisations in Karaikal.

“Schools must be opened only after a vaccine is available for COVID-19 and students are immunised. Else, the lives of students, teachers and parents will be at stake what with the pandemic spreading fast,” S. Anandkumar, president, IAC Karaikal unit, said.

The Puducherry government must desist from budging to the pressure exerted by private school managements to re-open the institutions, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/announcement-on-reopening-of-schools-draws-flak-in-karaikal/article32786302.ece
380,2020/10/06,‘Keep rhinoceros beetle at bay’,"The Coconut Research Station, Veppankulam, has advised farmers engaged in replanting coconut seedlings in areas affected by cyclone Gaja to adopt an integrated approach to check rhinoceros beetle attack in trees.

Rhinoceros beetle is a pest which cuts the leaves of coconut in a ‘V’ shape. Fallen coconut stems kept in heaps in farmers’ gardens and in common sites in villages serve as breeding ground for carry over population of rhinoceros beetles. From there they spread to coconut seedlings posing a threat to coconut farms, said V.G. Mathirajan, Assistant Professor, Coconut Research Station, Veppankulam, in an advisory to farmers.

Coconut trees on 41,492 hectares of the total area of 54,133 hectares in Thanjavur, Thiruvarur, Nagapattinam and Pudukkottai districts were damaged in cyclone Gaja during November 2018, affecting the livelihood of thousands of delta farmers.

With 76% of the total coconut area in the districts damaged due to cyclone, replanting of coconut seedling has been taken up in the affected areas.

Mr. Mathirajan says adult rhino beetles damaged the replanted young seedlings through a unique mode of entry at the collar region, the junction point of seedling stem with soil. Soil bore holes are seen in the collar portion of the coconut seedlings and presence of adult beetle is noticed when the affected collar region is split opened.

““Drying of central shoots are seen in the damaged seedlings and these dried shoots come out when they are pulled out. The extent of damage by rhinoceros beetle in young seedling ranged from 21% to 30%,” he said.

“The foremost management strategy to save the seedlings is removal and burning of coconut stems left in the garden and in the common places to maintain good sanitation,” he added.

The beetle in its various bio-stages should be collected from the manure pits and destroyed. Green muscardine fungus (Metarrhizium anisopliae) can be sprayed at the rate of 250 ml with 750 ml water for every cubic meter area of manure pits to check the perpetuation of the pest. As a physical barrier, the young replanted coconut seedlings may be covered with old nylon net used by fishermen to curtail the entry of rhino beetle into the seedlings.

To monitor and mass trap the adult beetles, light traps and pheromone trap (one each for a hectare) can be placed. A mixture of neem seed kernel powder and sand (150 gm/seedling) may be placed in the leaf axils at the rate of 1:2 ratio to keep the beetles at bay. Napthalene balls (12 gm per seedling) may also placed in the central whorl to repel the beetles attacking the young seedling, Mr. Mathirajan suggested.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/bothzx/article32786278.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY07-RHIBO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/keep-rhinoceros-beetle-at-bay/article32786279.ece

382,2020/10/06,Chathiram bus stand project back on track,"Construction is scheduled for completion in May 2021, says Tiruchi Corporation Commissioner

Despite shortage of labour, which held up construction work for a while, and other logistic issues during the lockdown, officials of Tiruchi Corporation hope that the remodelled Chathiram Bus Stand terminus will be ready to be opened by March.

Although the project, which is being executed at an estimate of ₹17.34 crore, began in June 2019, it is only in November that the work has gathered momentum.

Amenities

As per plan, the terminus will have 30 bus bays, a waiting hall for passengers, cloak room, feeding room for lactating mothers, ticket counters, food court and retiring room for police and bus crew. There will be provision for a parking lot with a capacity to accommodate 350 two-wheelers.

Construction of 33 shops — 17 on the ground floor and 16 on other floor was also part of the remodelling project.

To facilitate construction, special arrangements have been made to provide halts for city buses along a shopping complex alongside St. Joseph’s College. After about four months of hectic work, construction had to be stalled due to the lockdown in the last week of March. No progress could be made for two months from April.

The exodus of migrant workers to their native places also impacted the progress of the project.

However, officials claim that the project is on track again with redeployment of dedicated workforce of 100 skilled and unskilled workers drawn from Utter Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha. It is said that raising of pillars and construction of shops have been completed. Nearly two-third of the roof of the terminal has also been completed. The last leg of construction of the roof is on and it will be completed in 10 days.

“The project is well on track. It is scheduled to be completed in May 2021. Going by the progress of work, we are confident that the terminal can be opened to the public in February or March,” S. Sivasubramanian, Commissioner, Tiruchi Corporation, told The Hindu.

The official adds that 63% of work has been completed. The remaining work will be mostly interior in nature. Hence, it will continue even during the north-east monsoon.

Laying of roads

According to another official, it has been proposed to lay roads in and around the bus terminal.

Administrative sanction is expected for starting the work and a proposal has been sent to the government for approval.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/dcksvy/article32786251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY07-TERMINAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/chathiram-bus-stand-project-back-on-track/article32786252.ece

384,2020/10/06,Queries over high cost of online learning,"While schools have completed a number of portions through online sessions over the last few months, a sizeable section of parents wonder why these institutions collected a big chunk of fee when the overheads expenditure would be much lesser under the online teaching-learning system.

“The video-conferencing apps, which the schools deploy, are not that expensive to justify collection of the full fee. Also, the mechanism simply does not suit average and below average students,” Perumal, a parent said.

The only saving grace is that the schools have not conducted exams online though short tests are being tried out, he said.

“At the most, one can say that despite flaws, the online teaching-learning system is essential as students cannot be allowed to remain idle at home for months. However, the schools must consider some concession in fee,” Rajesh Kumar, another parent of a student of a CBSE school, said.

Private managements say there is substantial expenditure involved in conducting online classes.The live video-conference classes conducted with open source software may not involve expenditure. But it is not possible for teachers to complete the portions by that method.

For higher classes, delivery of quality video content of the classes through service providers is necessary. The advantage of the delivery of video content is that the students will have access to it for 24 hours. Those who do not grasp the concept can play it again.

For delivery of quality video content, classes handled by experts need to be recorded with quality cameras. “The money we pay to service providers for this is e substantial. Also, teachers salaries constitutes a major portion of the expenditure,” a functionary of a private school management said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/queries-over-high-cost-of-online-learning/article32786184.ece
385,2020/10/06,Elephant rehabilitation centre moves towards fodder self-sufficiency,"It has created a two-acre plot to raise sorghum

The Forest Department has developed a fodder plot inside the Elephant Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre at M.R. Palayam near here. At present, there are seven captive elephants at the centre.

The fodder plot to grow sorghum has been created on nearly two hectares on the 20-hectare premises and the crop is getting ready for harvest. Forest officials have used organic manure to raise the plant.

The centre, adjoining Tiruchi-Chennai National Highway, became functional in September last when the first captive elephant, Malachi, was translocated from Madurai to the centre. Subsequently, five more captive elephants, including three pachyderms owned by Kanchi Mutt, were brought at different times. The latest entrant, Deivanai, was brought from Tiruppankundram Subramania Swamy Temple in Madurai district in June during lockdown.

A balanced dietary schedule prescribed by veterinarians for the seven elephants is followed here.

Forest officials say they decided to use a portion of the sprawling centre to develop a fodder plot with the twin objectives of expanding the greenery inside and for feeding the pachyderms.

“Sorghum is rich in fibre, potassium and micro-nutrients, making it suitable for elephants for consumption,” says S. Ramasubramanian, Conservator of Forests, Thanjavur Circle. He also holds additional charge of Tiruchi Circle.

The Forest Department has also planned to expand the fodder plot to nearly 10 hectares in the near future as this will enable in meeting green fodder requirements and avert the need to buy from outside which is the case at present.

The centre has a team of seven mahouts, who are assisted by kaavadis, to look after the captive pachyderms, which are housed in separate sheds. Also, there are a couple of ponds and showers for the elephants to take bath, seven water troughs to drink water, 11 sheds and a two-km walkway for daily exercise.

In addition to these facilities, there is a veterinary centre, separate kitchen to prepare dietary food for the elephants and quarters to accommodate the mahouts and kaavadis. Five borewells have been sunk to meet the water requirements. Eight surveillance cameras have been installed for real time monitoring even in mobile phones.

According to Mr. Ramasubramanian, green fodder, including sorghum, naanal grass, coconut leaves, vaagai and alanthalai, are given to elephants, besides seasonal fruits and vegetables such as water melon, carrots and pumpkins. Cooked food such as raagi balls mixed with jaggery and salt are fed to the animals.

The health condition of every elephant is closely monitored by local and forest veterinarians from Coimbatore and Vandalur Zoological Park. The animals have developed strong bonding and started communicating with each other inside the green environment, adds Mr. Ramasubramanian.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/qua3e/article32786163.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY07-ELEPHANTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/elephant-rehabilitation-centre-moves-towards-fodder-self-sufficiency/article32786164.ece

Congress cadre led by Karur MP S. Jothimani on Tuesday staged a protest in front of a statue of Mahatma Gandhi here, condemning the Uttar Pradesh government for its mishandling of the Hathras gang-rape case and the high-handed attitude of the police in preventing Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi from proceeding to Hathras.

Carrying placards, the protesters sat in front of the Gandhi statue terming it a ‘satyagraha.’ The protest was withdrawn after about two hours.

The protesters alleged that instead of taking action against the accused, who were involved in the brutal murder of a 19-year-old Dalit young woman, the Yogi Adityanath government had been protecting them, they said. The UP government was attempting to silence those who came out in support of the victim, they said.

Condemning the lathi charge against the Congress cadres, who had accompanied the Gandhis while marching towards Hathras, Ms. Jothimani said that Opposition parties had every right to meet the affected persons.

389,2020/10/06,Cases of minors being forcedinto flesh trade on the rise,"Report released by Union Ministry reveals disturbing facts

A report by the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development has come out with a report ‘Commercial sexual exploitation in India’, according to which there are over three million sex workers in India, out of which 35.47% enter into prostitution before they enter 18 years. The International Day of No Prostitution was observed on October 5.

The other facts in the report include an alarming rate at which minors are being forced into flesh trade. According to a survey, about 1.2 million children are involved in such trade. The report also revealed that there was a 50% increase in prostitution in India between 1997 and 2004.

The report also said that Mumbai and Kolkata have among the largest brothel based sex industry. In Mumbai, about 1,00,000 sex workers are involved. The government organisations like Maharashtra District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) and NGOs like National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) play an important role in combating STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) and increase awareness on HIV/AIDS.

There are diverse views on legalising profession, and a number of NGOs have suggested that the prostitution be legalised and laws framed to prevent exploitation.

In Andhra Pradesh, the trade runs in the semi nomadic tribal community that resides in slums in various towns. Adolescent girls are initiated into the family 'tradition', while their brothers become 'agents'. According to K.K. Mukherjee, former head of the Department of Social Work, DU. Apart from the community, there are other tribal communities in Anantapur district who take up prostitution as their primary source of income.

NGOs’ campaign

NGOs like Help and Vimukthi have been campaigning for the rights of children and prevent second generation prostitution and to end human trafficking. “We have been asking for compensation for victims under the laws.

Following directions by Director-General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang, police identified (mapped) 50,958 religious places, including 30,415 temples, 5,442 mosques and 15,101 churches in the State.

Surveillance cameras have been arranged at 2,676 temples, 623 masjids and 1,001 churches and police are insisting the managements on instilling CCTV cameras, arrange proper electrification and provide security to the shrines with the locals.

Mr. Sawang directed the Superintendents of Police (SPs), Deputy Superintendents of Police (DSPs) and the Station House Officers (SHOs) to visit the religious places in person, hold meetings with villagers and keep a tab on the criminals and those having history.

Friendly policing

Krishna district Superintendent of Police (S) M. Ravindranath Babu said as part of friendly policing Grama Rakshana Dalams have been formed to prevent thefts and other crimes in villages and involve people in policing.

“Out of eight thefts occurred in temples post Antarvedi temple incident, seven were detected in Krishna district and the accused were arrested. Members of Grama Rakshana Dalams helped the police in detecting the accused quickly,” Gudivada DSP N. Satyanandam said.

“Police bound over 8,210 persons involved in thefts and attacks on shrines in the State in last six years, and a few were notorious and inter-State offenders involved in many cases,” a police officer said on Monday.

“This year, 230 cases of thefts and attacks on religious places were reported up to September 30. I request the people to respect the sentiments of all sections in society, not to resort to anti-social activities and cooperate with the police in maintaining law and order,” Mr. Sawang said.

Meanwhile, the Mahila Samrakshana Karyadarsulu (MSKs) along with grama and ward volunteers are visiting the shrines in villages and collecting the details of the religious places.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/dqel51/article32777310.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06VIJTEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/suspect-sheets-in-attacks-on-places-of-worship/article32777311.ece

The Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday that it was expecting COVID-19 vaccine supplies to be available from early next year.

Addressing a press conference, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said: “If all goes well, we are looking at vaccine supplies coming in the first quarter of next year. There is a digital platform that is being enhanced to track on real-time basis the vaccine movement, from procurement, storage to distribution and administration.” He added that discussions were under way on the Russian vaccine, Sputnik V.

Balram Bhargava, director-general, Indian Council of Medical Research, said their studies had found no benefit of plasma therapy.

Combined trials

Meanwhile, an expert panel at the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has asked Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories to submit a revised protocol for conducting both phase-2 and 3 human clinical trials in India for the Russian vaccine, sources said.

The Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company had applied to the Drugs Controller General of India late last week, seeking permission to conduct phase-3 human clinical trials of the vaccine. The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on COVID-19 at the CDSCO, which held its meeting on Monday, deliberated on the application and asked the firm to submit a revised protocol stating that it will have to conduct combined phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, sources said.

The firm has been asked to provide some other information as well.

“It means that Dr. Reddy’s laboratories will have to submit a new application. According to the Subject Expert Committee, they have to conduct both phase-2 and 3 clinical trials and cannot directly hold phase-3 trial for the vaccine in India,” a source said.

Dr. Reddy’s has collaborated with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to conduct clinical trials of Sputnik V vaccine as well as for its distribution. Upon regulatory approval in India, RDIF shall supply to drug maker Dr. Reddy’s 100 million doses of the vaccine, the firm had said last month.

884 deaths in 24 hours

Dismissing reports of India having reached and crossed its COVID-19 peak, Mr. Bhushan said that with festival season round the corner, this was no time to lower the guard.

The Ministry said that 48% of COVID-related deaths were being reported from 25 districts in eight States, including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, adding that the Ministry was in talks with these States to control the deaths. “The target is to bring down the overall fatality below 1%,” Mr. Bhushan said. He added that 884 case fatalities were reported in the past 24 hours.

“India continues to report a trend of steadily declining active cases as a percentage of the total positive cases. Presently, the active cases comprise 13.75% of the total positive cases of the country, standing at 9,19,023. The declining trend of the percentage active cases is commensurately supported by the rising percentage of recovered cases. The total recovered cases stand at 56,62,490. The gap between recovered cases and active cases has crossed 47 lakh (47,43,467). Higher number of recoveries has aided the national recovery rate to further improve to 84.70%,” he said.

The Ministry noted that 75,787 patients got discharged in the last 24 hours whereas the new confirmed cases stood at 61,267.

400,2020/10/06,The Hindu Explains | What have the three laureates sharing the 2020 Physics Nobel discovered about the black hole?,"How did the black hole come of age?

The story so far: The Nobel Prize for Physics, announced on October 6, was shared by three laureates. One half went to Roger Penrose, now at the University of Oxford, for ‘the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity’. The other half is shared by Reinhard Genzel of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, Garching, Germany, and Andrea M. Ghez of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), for ‘the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy’. A statement from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which selects the awardees for the Prize, said the three laureates were awarded “for their discoveries about one of the most exotic phenomena in the universe, the black hole”.

What is the early history of the black hole?

Over a hundred years before Albert Einstein published his theory of relativity, John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace had speculated that extremely dense stars could have such high gravity that not even light could escape them. These would become invisible (dark stars). This idea came back to life in 1916, when just a few weeks after Einstein had published his theory of relativity, German astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found a solution to these equations, having a feature that was later named ‘event horizon’ — the point of no return, beyond which even light, the fastest object in the world, cannot escape. However, these concepts and their implications were so bizarre then that even Einstein refused to believe that it was possible.

An Indian researcher, B. Datt, and independently, Robert Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder, made the first calculations of the gravitational collapse of a star in the 1930s. However, they had made the simplifying assumption of spherical symmetry.

By the early 1960s, observations of ‘quasars’, which are now called active galactic nuclei, were preparing the ground for the eventual observational evidence for supermassive blackholes.

What were the key questions when Dr. Penrose came into the picture?

The scenario of a spherically symmetric massive star collapsing under its own gravity until it falls below the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon) to form an infinitely dense singularity had been described independently by Datt and Oppenheimer and Snyder.

Podcast: Also Read Explaining the science behind this year’s Nobel Prizes for Chemistry and Physics | The Hindu In Focus podcast

“This was, however, conditional on the high degree of symmetry [spherical symmetry], which almost certainly does not hold for realistic astrophysical collapse,” says Prof. Ghanashyam Date, Chennai Mathematical Institute. The question was: would a complete gravitational collapse happen without spherical symmetry?

What was Dr. Penrose’s achievement?

Prof. Date sums it up thus: while more solutions of the Einstein equation were found, suggesting blackholes hiding singularities, they all had special symmetries and their realisation under generic astrophysical conditions was in doubt.

Dr. Penrose, through his singularity theorems, conceptualised the formation of ‘trapped surfaces’ as the condition for formation of black holes in a generic manner. He made it possible for the world of physics to accept that black holes can and will form in the universe, as described by Einstein’s field equations.

How did observations of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way begin?

American astronomer Harlow Shapley, about a hundred years ago, was the first person to identify the centre of the galaxy. By the 1960s, we learnt that there was a source of radio waves sitting there. This was named ‘Sagittarius A*’, and it is approximately 26,000 light years away, i.e., light from this point would take 26,000 years to reach us. In comparison, light from the Sun takes approximately eight minutes to reach the Earth.

In the 1990s, larger telescope facilities became available and Dr. Ghez started a research programme from the Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Dr. Genzel’s group first used the New Technology Telescope in La Silla, Chile, and later moved to the Very Large Telescope on the Cerro Paranal mountain in Chile.

How did they determine that there was a black hole?

All the stars in the Milky Way orbit the centre. For example, the Sun orbits Sagittarius A* in more than 200 million years. For nearly three decades, the groups observed some thirty stars, particularly one that was named S2 by one group and S02 by the other. They found that the stars move in perfect elliptical orbits, just as if the object about which they were orbiting (Sagittarius A*) is a concentrated mass [compact object] and not diffused or scattered. Given its calculated mass of about four million solar masses, and its invisibility, this could only be a supermassive black hole, they deduced.

Dr. Ghez is the fourth woman to receive the Physics Nobel. Who are the other three?

Since 1901, a total of 114 physics Nobel prizes have been awarded. Before Dr. Ghez, only three had gone to women: Marie Curie (1903, for radiation phenomena), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963, nuclear shell structure), Donna Strickland (2018, ultrashort, high-intensity laser pulses).",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/1ln1id/article32783166.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/111-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/explained-2020-nobel-prize-in-physics/article32783167.ece
401,2020/10/06,Three share Physics Nobel for their discoveries about black holes,"The 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded with one half to Roger Penrose and the other half jointly to Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez

Three scientists won this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for advancing our understanding of black holes, the all-consuming monsters that lurk in the darkest parts of the universe.

Briton Roger Penrose received half of this year’s prize “for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity,” the Nobel Committee said.

Also read: Your questions on black holes answered

German Reinhard Genzel and American Andrea Ghez received the second half of the prize “for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the center of our galaxy.”

The prize celebrates “one of the most exotic objects in the universe,” black holes, which have become a staple of science fact and science fiction and where time seems to stand still, according to the committee.

Black holes are perhaps the most mysterious and powerful objects in astronomy. They are at the center of every galaxy, and smaller ones are dotted around the universe. Nothing, not even light, can escape their incredible gravity. They are the ultimate cosmic dead end.

""Black holes, because they are so hard to understand, is what makes them so appealing,” Ghez told Tuesday morning. “I really think of science as a big, giant puzzle.”

Penrose proved with mathematics that the formation of black holes was possible, based heavily on Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity.

""Einstein did not himself believe that black holes really exist, these super-heavyweight monsters that capture everything that enters them,” the committee said. “Nothing can escape, not even light.”

Martin Rees, the British astronomer royal, noted that Penrose triggered a “renaissance” in the study of relativity in the 1960s, and that, together with a young Stephen Hawking, he helped firm up evidence for the Big Bang and black holes.

""Penrose and Hawking are the two individuals who have done more than anyone else since Einstein to deepen our knowledge of gravity,” Rees said. “Sadly, this award was too much delayed to allow Hawking to share the credit.”

It wasn’t until the 1990s that Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez, each leading a group of astronomers, trained their sights on the dust-covered center of our Milky Way galaxy, a region called Sagittarius A(asterisk), where something strange was going on.

They both found that there was “an extremely heavy, invisible object that pulls on the jumble of stars, causing them to rush around at dizzying speeds.”

It was a black hole. Not just an ordinary black hole, but a supermassive black hole, 4 million times the mass of our sun.

Now scientists know that all galaxies have supermassive black holes.

In 2019, scientists got the first optical image of a black hole, and Ghez, who was not involved, praised the discovery.

""Today we accept these objects are critical to the building blocks of the universe,” Ghez told an audience at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences by phone shortly after the announcement.

Ghez is the fourth woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize for physics, after Marie Curie in 1903, Maria Goeppert-Mayer in 1963, and Donna Strickland in 2018.

""I hope I can inspire other young women into the field. It’s a field that has so many pleasures. And if you’re passionate about the science, there’s so much that can be done,” Ghez said.

The Nobel Committee said black holes “still pose many questions that beg for answers and motivate future research.”

It is common for several scientists who worked in related fields to share the prize. Last year’s prize went to Canadian-born cosmologist James Peebles for theoretical work about the early moments after the Big Bang, and Swiss astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz for discovering a planet outside our solar system.

The prestigious award comes with a gold medal and prize money of 10 million Swedish kronor (more than $1.1 million), courtesy of a bequest left 124 years ago by the prize’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The amount was increased recently to adjust for inflation.

On Monday, the Nobel Committee awarded the prize for physiology and medicine to Americans Harvey J. Alter and Charles M. Rice and British-born scientist Michael Houghton for discovering the liver-ravaging hepatitis C virus.

The other prizes, to be announced in the coming days, are for outstanding work in the fields of chemistry, literature, peace and economics.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/e1j8vu/article32782141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/2020-nobel-prize-in-physics/article32781691.ece
402,2020/10/06,24 potentially ‘superhabitable’ exoplanets identified,"The researchers selected planet-star systems with probable terrestrial planets orbiting within the host star’s liquid water habitable zone

Scientists have identified 24 planets outside our solar system that they say may have conditions more suitable for life than the Earth.

The study, published in the journal Astrobiology, details characteristics of potential “superhabitable” planets, that include those that are older, a little larger, slightly warmer and possibly wetter than Earth.

Also read: What are exoplanets, and what is ‘dark’ matter?

The researchers from the Washington State University (WSU) in the U.S. noted life could more easily thrive on planets that circle more slowly changing stars with longer lifespans than our Sun.

The 24 top contenders for superhabitable planets are all more than 100 light years away, but the study could help focus future observation efforts, such as from NASA’s James Web Space Telescope, they said.

“With the next space telescopes coming up, we will get more information, so it is important to select some targets,” said Dirk Schulze-Makuch, a professor at WSU and the Technical University in Berlin. “We have to focus on certain planets that have the most promising conditions for complex life. However, we have to be careful to not get stuck looking for a second Earth because there could be planets that might be more suitable for life than ours.”

The researchers identified superhabitability criteria and searched among the 4,500 known exoplanets for good candidates. Habitability does not mean these planets definitely have life, merely the conditions that would be conducive to life, they noted.

The researchers selected planet-star systems with probable terrestrial planets orbiting within the host star’s liquid water habitable zone from the Kepler Object of Interest Exoplanet Archive of transiting exoplanets.

While the Sun is the centre of our solar system, it has a relatively short lifespan of less than 10 billion years, they said. Since it took nearly 4 billion years before any form of complex life appeared on Earth, many similar stars to our sun, called G stars, might run out of fuel before complex life can develop, according to the researchers.

In addition to looking at systems with cooler G stars, they also looked at systems with K dwarf stars, which are somewhat cooler, less massive and less luminous than the Sun. The researchers said K stars have the advantage of long lifespans of 20 billion to 70 billion years. This would allow orbiting planets to be older as well as giving life more time to advance to the complexity currently found on Earth, they said.

However, to be habitable, planets should not be so old that they have exhausted their geothermal heat and lack protective geomagnetic fields.

Earth is around 4.5 billion years old, but the researchers argue that the sweet spot for life is a planet that is between 5 billion to 8 billion years old. Size and mass also matter.

A planet that is 10% larger than the Earth should have more habitable land, the researchers said.

One that is about 1.5 times Earth’s mass would be expected to retain its interior heating through radioactive decay longer and would also have a stronger gravity to retain an atmosphere over a longer time period, they said.

Water is key to life and the researchers argue that a little more of it would help, especially in the form of moisture, clouds and humidity.

They noted that a slightly overall warmer temperature, a mean surface temperature of about 5 degrees Celsius greater than Earth, together with the additional moisture, would be also better for life.

Among the 24 top planet candidates none of them meet all the criteria for superhabitable planets, but one has four of the critical characteristics, making it possibly much more comfortable for life than our home planet, the researchers added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/6tdys0/article32781281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/140871935115ebf5d7fc7kNASAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/24-potentially-superhabitable-exoplanets-identified/article32781279.ece
403,2020/10/06,"Dust responsible for snowmelt at higher elevation in western Himalayan Region, study says","While dust transported as elevated aerosol layers get deposited at 1-5 km elevation, black carbon emission influences melting of snow from surface to about 3 km elevation.

While black carbon has a large effect on snow darkening and resultant melting of snow, dust particles transported from as far as Saudi Arabia that gets deposited in the Western Himalayan Region — Hindu Kush, Karakoram and western Himalaya ranges — has a large role to play in melting of snow, particularly at higher elevations, a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change has found.

This is the first time the role of long-distance transported dust in elevational heterogeneity of snow melting in the Himalayas has been made, says Dr. Chandan Sarangi from the Department of Civil Engineering at IIT Madras, who is one of the corresponding authors of the paper.

Dr. Yun Qian from the the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Richland, Washington, is the other corresponding author of the paper. The work was done when in collaboration with PNNL, University of Colorado, Boulder and University of California, Los Angeles.

While dust transported as elevated aerosol layers get deposited at 1-5 km elevation, black carbon emission is mostly a surface phenomenon and influences melting of snow from surface to about 3 km elevation.

Based on remote sensing data of spatial distribution of dust aerosol concentration over the Indian subcontinent and dust-induced snow albedo reduction over Himalayas during the period 2011-2016 (March-August) and simulations, the authors show that the relative impacts of dust and black carbon vary with surface elevation of snowpack. This is in addition to snowmelt caused by warming due to climate change.

Earlier studies have shown that the magnitude of snow mass decrease is about 1 mm per year at 1 km elevation, about 5 mm per year at 4.5 km elevation and about 3 mm per year at 6 km elevation.

Though black carbon has a larger snow albedo darkening effect than dust due to a larger mass absorption efficiency, the study found that the radiative effects of dust deposited on snow are comparable to black carbon in the Western Himalayan Region at higher elevations. This is mainly because the deposition of dust by mass is 100-1,000 times more than black carbon.

“As the elevation increases, the influence of dust becomes greater than black carbon, and this coincides with maximum intensity of snowmelt reduction seen at 3-5 km elevation. Between these two, black carbon mainly contributes to snowmelt at lower elevation while dust is the major contributor for snowmelt at higher elevation,” he says.

Westerlies transport dust particles as elevated aerosol layers at maximum intensities mostly during the pre-monsoon period (March to May) and this gets deposited at higher elevations in the western Himalayan region.

“Due to global warming, snow cover at lower elevations in the Himalayas will occur less frequently or totally disappear compared with snow cover at higher elevations. The annual contribution of dust to snowmelt will therefore likely increase in the future as the black carbon effect at lower elevation weakens with dwindling snowpack,” they write.

“Snowmelt is the main source of water for many major Himalayan rivers. Dust deposition during the pre-monsoon period causes early snowmelt water in the Himalayan rivers and a reduction of snowmelt water during peak summer months,” Dr. Sarangi says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/rk1taw/article31407185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23mputtarakhand2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/dust-responsible-for-snowmelt-at-higher-elevation-in-western-himalayan-region-study-says/article32779522.ece
404,2020/10/06,"Dr Reddy’s asked to resubmit application for both phase 2,3 trials of Russian COVID-19 vaccine","The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on COVID-19 at the CDSCO, which held its meeting on Monday, deliberated on the application and asked the firm to submit a revised protocol stating it will have to conduct combined phase 2 and 3 clinical trials

New Delhi An expert panel at the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has asked Dr Reddy’s Laboratories to submit a revised protocol for conducting both phase 2 and phase 3 human clinical trials for the Russian vaccine against COVID-19, Sputnik V, in India, sources said on Monday.

The Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company had applied to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) late last week, seeking permission to conduct phase-3 human clinical trials of the Russian vaccine.

The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on COVID-19 at the CDSCO, which held its meeting on Monday, deliberated on the application and asked the firm to submit a revised protocol stating it will have to conduct combined phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, sources told PTI.

The firm has been asked to provide some other information as well.

“It means that Dr Reddy’s laboratories will have to submit a new application. According to the SEC, they have to conduct both phase-2 and 3 clinical trials and cannot directly hold phase-3 trial for the vaccine in India,” a source said.

The Indian pharma giant has collaborated with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to conduct clinical trials of Sputnik V vaccine as well as for its distribution.

Upon regulatory approval in India, RDIF shall supply to drug maker Dr Reddy’s 100 million doses of the vaccine, the firm had said last month.

According to sources, it would be multi-centre, observer-blind, randomised controlled study.

Sources said, meanwhile, the phase -3 trial of Sputnik V is underway in Russia since September 1 on around 40,000 subjects.

Sputnik V has been developed by the Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology and RDIF.

Currently two indigenously developed vaccine candidates, one by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR and another one by Zydus Cadila Ltd, are in the phase 2 of the human clinical trials.

The Pune-based Serum Institute of India, which has partnered with AstraZeneca for manufacturing the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine candidate also is conducting Phase 2 and 3 human clinical trials of the candidate in India.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/o4ikzb/article32624203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SputnikV,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/dr-reddys-asked-to-resubmit-application-for-both-phase-23-trials-of-russian-covid-19-vaccine/article32777557.ece
405,2020/10/06,COVID-19 could spread by airborne transmission: CDC,"Last month, the CDC published and then took down its guidance warning possible airborne transmission of the novel coronavirus.

U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in an updated guidance on Monday, said COVID-19 can spread through airborne transmission, a month after it took down a similar warning.

It said some people could get infected by exposure to the novel coronavirus in small droplets and particles, or aerosols, that can linger in the air for minutes to hours.

Aerosols lingering in the air could be a major source of COVID-19 transmission, a group of U.S. scientists warned in an unrelated open letter published in medical journal Science on Monday.

The focus must be on protecting against airborne transmission because individuals with COVID-19 release thousands of virus-laden aerosols and far fewer droplets while breathing and talking, the scientists said.

The Hindu Explains | Is airborne transmission of COVID-19 a risk?

CDC's Monday update acknowledges some earlier reports that showed limited, uncommon circumstances where people with COVID-19 infected others who were more than 6 feet away or shortly after a COVID-19-positive person left an area, the agency said.

In these instances, the CDC said transmission occurred in poorly ventilated and enclosed spaces that often involved activities that caused heavier breathing, like singing or exercise.
