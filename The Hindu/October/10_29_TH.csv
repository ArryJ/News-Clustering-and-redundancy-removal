0,2020/10/29,TTFI prepares roadmap for Nationals,"Sonepat and Indore zeroed in to host only singles events in all five categories

The Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) has prepared the roadmap to host the National championships at all levels in the next few months.

Given the logistical challenges in the prevailing circumstances, Sonepat and Indore are likely to host all five Nationals championships — cadet, sub-junior, junior, youth and seniors.

Elaborating on the plans, TTFI secretary-general M.P. Singh said, “the federation is clear that we have to host these championship in asecure environment. Health of the players, coaches and officials are of paramount importance. We zeroed in on Sonepat and Indore because we are confident of providing the participants all arrangements in a bio-secure zone.

“The plan is to host only singles events in every National. Therefore, we are giving the team and doubles events a miss this year. We will the finish girls’/women singles and once they leave the venue, the competition for boys/men will start. In between, there could be a day’s gap to sanitise the accommodation and the venue.

“The TTFI is set carry out COVID-19 tests on around 1000 players, coaches and officials, which could cost the federation around ₹20 lakh.

“We have called a meeting of all our affiliates on Monday to ascertain how each of them plans to go about its State championships, ahead of the Nationals. Depending on the suggestions from all the stakeholders, we will firm up our plans,” he said.

Financial support

Meanwhile, in a commendable gesture, the TTFI is set to distribute up to ₹50 lakh to about 100 players and coaches in need of urgent financial help in these challenging times.

“Many of these players and coaches have had no source of income for the past seven months. We have asked the State associations to give an affidavit to the effect that the nominated player/coach is not getting financial help from any other source. The first instalment will be given very shortly,” declared Singh.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/rater6/article32975828.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30SINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ttfi-prepares-roadmap-for-nationals/article32975829.ece

2,2020/10/29,Apple’s MagSafe| A brief history of the tech,"Apple’s idea with the MagSafe was to avoid any damage to laptop and power sockets caused by someone tripping over the power cable and pulling it out of the socket.

Apple recently relaunched MagSafe, a more-than-a-decade old wireless charging technology, for its new line of iPhone12 models.

For the first time, the iPhone 12 Pro models will utilise 100% recycled rare earth metals in all magnets, including MagSafe and its accessories, Apple claimed.

MagSafe is Apple’s proprietary technology launched in January 2006 for MacBook Pro, the company’s first laptop with Intel’s SoC in it.

The original version of MagSafe is a magnetic power connector used for charging MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro. The connector magnetically attaches to the device, instead of plugging it to a port.

Apple’s idea with the MagSafe was to avoid any damage to laptop and power sockets caused by someone tripping over the power cable and pulling it out of the socket. The accident would throw the laptop down and damage it.

Four years ago, the Cupertino-based company discontinued MagSafe across its product lines, between 2016 and 2019, and replaced it charging cables, with USB-C this time. The last product line with MagSafe, the 2017 MacBook Air, was discontinued last year.

Although the company did not state the exact reason for discontinuing the technology, it did receive complaints from several users on issues relating to the adapter's insulation and overheating.

Apple acknowledged these problems in an official report ‘Apple Portables: Troubleshooting MagSafe adapters’ on its support page in 2016. It was published to guide users fix these issues.

In the same report, it also said that the connector and port on the Mac Notebook have a magnet that can erase data on credit cards or other magnetic devices. It suggested users to keep magnetic media away from the end of the adapter and the port to protect data.

The company also agreed that the adapter may overheat if kept in a poorly ventilated area like on a couch, thickly carpeted area, mattresses, or pillow. The charger may also automatically switch off.

The company introduced MagSafe2 in 2012, a newer version of the technology, which did not work with older MacBooks.

MagSafe in iPhone 12

After discontinuing its wireless charging for laptops, Apple is now introducing MagSafe for mobile phone and watch. The new charges can provide up to 15W of power.

MagSafe features an array of magnets around the wireless charging coil, and offers high-powered wireless charging. It will also provide an all-new ecosystem of accessories that will easily attach to iPhone, Apple said.

Apple is also selling MagSafe-compatible accessories like new silicone, leather, and clear cases that can snap onto the back of an iPhone.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/nj33fb/article32972843.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/newmagsafe,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/apples-magsafe-a-brief-history-of-the-tech/article32972780.ece
3,2020/10/29,Flipkart outperforms Amazon this Diwali shopping season,"Flipkart’s Big Billion Days Sale and Amazon’s Great Indian Festival Sales took place around the same days this month.

Flipkart outperformed Amazon in the Diwali shopping season this year in India in terms of user engagement and first-time app installs, according to a report by data analytics firm Apptopia.

The e-commerce operators conducted their Diwali sales around the same days this month.

Flipkart's Big Billion Days Sale attracted more new users than Amazon's sale. The Walmart-owned company's userbase grew by nearly 71%, to almost 3.5 million users, compared to same season last year. Amazon's Great Indian Festival Sale userbase grew 77%, to nearly 2.5 million users, compared to the same season last year.

First-time downloads grew more this year than any year previously. This is likely due to people staying home out of precaution during the pandemic, the report noted.

Most of India's commerce is still done in-person, but the pandemic has accelerated the country's transition to online. While Amazon grew downloads more year-over-year, Flipkart still came out on top in terms of absolute numbers.

User sessions on Flipkart's mobile app rose 87% this year compared with last year, while it grew about 37% on Amazon's mobile app. Flipkart dominated in both percentage growth and absolute figures. User sessions is a metric that helps understand engagement and account for people who already have the app installed on their mobile device.

4,2020/10/29,"How link previews on Instagram, Facebook Messenger can leak private information","Link previews in chat apps such as Facebook messenger, Twitter Direct Messages, Zoom and many other applications on iOS and Android can leak location data and share private information with third party servers.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Facebook and Instagram download all private link sent to their servers, irrespective of the size of the data, and provide no details on how long the information was stored in them, according to the findings of a pair of researchers.

They ran a video to show how hackers can run a JavaScript code on Instagram servers, and bypass data downloading limit on LinkedIn.

Link previews in chat apps such as Facebook messenger, Twitter Direct Messages, Zoom and many other applications on iOS and Android can leak location data and share private information with third party servers.

Several apps exposed links shared in end-to-end encrypted chats, and unnecessarily downloaded gigabytes of data quietly in the background, according to independent researchers Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk.

Link preview is a short summary with a preview image that appears when users send a link of a news article, a Word or PDF document, or a gif through chat apps.

Link previews can be generated in three ways- by the sender, receiver, or the server. The link generated by the server is the most concerning.

When the sender generates a preview, the app downloads what’s in the link. It creates a summary and a preview image of the website, and sends it as an attachment with the link.

When the app at the receiver’s end gets the message, it displays the preview before the user opens the link. This way, the receiver would be protected from any risk of clicking malicious links. Apps such as iMessage, Viber and WhatsApp follow this approach.

However, in the case of receiver generating a preview, app on the receiving end opens the link to automatically create a preview. To do so, it has to connect to the server that the link leads to and ask for what’s in the link. For the server to know where to send back the data, the app includes the phone’s IP address in the request.

If an individual is using an app that follows this approach, an attacker would just have to send a link to their own server to record IP address to determine user’s approximate location.

When the server generates a preview, the app first sends the link to an external server and asks it to generate a preview, then the server sends the preview back to both the sender and receiver. In this case, the problem arises when a user wants to send, say, a private Dropbox link to someone.

With this approach, the server will need to make a copy of what’s in the link to generate the preview.

In this scenario, Bakry and Mysk note in their blog that there’s no indication to users that the servers are downloading whatever they find in a link. It’s not clear if the server keeps a copy, and if yes, for how long does it hold this information.

The researchers found that the apps vary widely in how much data gets downloaded by their servers. For instance, Facebook Messenger downloads entire files if it’s a picture or a video, even files gigabytes in size. Similarly, Instagram servers will download anything, no matter the size. And LinkedIn, Zoom and Twitter download up to 50 MB, 30 MB, and 25 MB of any kind of file, respectively.

Though most apps put limits on how much data is downloaded, even a 15 MB limit covers most files that would typically be shared through a link.

“So, if these servers do keep copies, it would be a privacy nightmare if there’s ever a data breach of these servers. This is especially a concern for business apps like Zoom and Slack,” Bakry and Mysk concluded.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/xmemgp/article32971530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/facebook-previewjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/how-link-previews-on-instagram-facebook-messenger-can-leak-private-information/article32971399.ece
5,2020/10/29,"All about Section 230, a rule that made the modern internet","Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act - itself part of a broader telecom law - provides a legal “safe harbor” for internet companies.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Twenty-six words tucked into a 1996 US law overhauling telecommunications have allowed companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google to grow into the giants they are today.

Those are the words President Donald Trump’s administration has challenged directly via executive order, one that would strip those protections if online platforms engaged in “editorial decisions.” The CEOs of the three internet companies face questioning Wednesday by the Senate Commerce Committee about Republican claims of anti-conservative bias.

Beyond questioning the CEOs, senators are expected to examine proposals to revise long-held legal protections for online speech, an immunity that critics in both parties say enables the companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.

Under the U.S. law, internet companies are generally exempt from liability for the material users post on their networks. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act - itself part of a broader telecom law - provides a legal “safe harbor” for internet companies.

But Trump and other politicians, including Democrats, though for different reasons than Republicans argue that Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity - or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government.

Section 230 probably can’t be easily dismantled. But if it was, the internet as we know it might cease to exist.

What is Section 230?

If a news site falsely calls you a swindler, you can sue the publisher for libel. But if someone posts that on Facebook, you can’t sue the company - just the person who posted it.

That’s thanks to Section 230, which states that “no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”

That legal phrase shields companies that can host trillions of messages from being sued into oblivion by anyone who feels wronged by something someone else has posted - whether their complaint is legitimate or not.

The legal interpretation of section 230 also allows social platforms to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services’ own standards, so long as they are acting in “good faith.”

Where did Section 230 come from?

The measure’s history dates back to the 1950s, when bookstore owners were being held liable for selling books containing “obscenity,” which is not protected by the First Amendment. One case eventually made it to the Supreme Court, which held that it created a “chilling effect” to hold someone liable for someone else’s content.

That meant plaintiffs had to prove that bookstore owners knew they were selling obscene books, said Jeff Kosseff, the author of “The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet,” a book about Section 230.

Fast-forward a few decades to when the commercial internet was taking off with services like CompuServe and Prodigy. Both offered online forums, but CompuServe chose not to moderate its, while Prodigy, seeking a family-friendly image, did.

CompuServe was sued over that, and the case was dismissed. Prodigy, however, got in trouble. The judge in their case ruled that “they exercised editorial control - so you’re more like a newspaper than a newsstand,” Kosseff said.

That didn’t sit well with politicians, who worried that outcome would discourage newly forming internet companies from moderating at all. And Section 230 was born.

""Today it protects both from liability for user posts as well as liability for any claims for moderating content,” Kosseff said.

What happens if Section 230 is limited or goes away?

“I don’t think any of the social media companies would exist in their current forms without Section 230,” Kosseff said. “They have based their business models on being large platforms for user content.”

There are two possible outcomes. Platforms might get more cautious, as Craigslist did following the 2018 passage of a sex-trafficking law that carved out an exception to Section 230 for material that “promotes or facilitates prostitution.” Craigslist quickly removed its “personals” section altogether, which wasn’t intended to facilitate sex work. But the company didn’t want to take any chances.

This outcome could actually hurt none other than the president himself, who routinely attacks private figures, entertains conspiracy theories and accuses others of crimes.

""If platforms were not immune under the law, then they would not risk the legal liability that could come with hosting Donald Trump’s lies, defamation, and threats,” said Kate Ruane, senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union.

Another possibility- Facebook, Twitter and other platforms could abandon moderation altogether and let the lower common denominator prevail.

Such unmonitored services could easily end up dominated by trolls, like 8chan, which is infamous for graphic and extremist content, said Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman. Undoing Section 230 would be an “an existential threat to the internet,” he said.

But Goldman doesn’t see the White House order as that kind of threat to the internet, saying it’s “political theater” that will appeal to Trump supporters. “The president can’t override Congress,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/7cto35/article32962596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/big-tech-eujpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/all-about-section-230-a-rule-that-made-the-modern-internet/article32970752.ece
6,2020/10/29,Italian regulator investigates Google over digital ads,"The Italian Competition Authority said it suspects the U.S. tech giant of using the vast amounts of data it collects through its various services to prevent rivals in the digital advertising market from competing effectively.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Italian regulators opened an investigation Wednesday into Google over alleged abuse of its dominant role in the country’s online ad market, adding to the global scrutiny that the Silicon Valley company is facing.

The Italian Competition Authority said it suspects the U.S. tech giant of using the vast amounts of data it collects through its various services to prevent rivals in the digital advertising market from competing effectively.

The watchdog said it carried out a joint inspection of Google’s offices with Italian tax police on Tuesday.

Italian authorities are focusing on the availability and use of data for display ads - the space that publishers and website owners make available to sell advertising content.

The authority said Google allegedly used tracking elements that allowed its ad broker services “to achieve a targeting capability that some equally efficient competitors are unable to replicate.”

It is also alleged to have discriminated against competitors by refusing to let them use third-party tracking tools. Advertisers use these tools to determine how effective their ad campaigns are by measuring how many views and clicks an online ad gets.

Google said it was abiding by the European Union’s data privacy rules.

""We’ll continue to work constructively with the Italian authorities on these important areas so that everyone can make the most of the web,” it said in a statement.

Reduced competition in the digital ad market could be bad for consumers, the authority said. It could starve news sites and publishers of resources, resulting in lower quality online content. It could also discourage innovation in new, less-intrusive advertising technologies.

Italy’s online advertising market was worth more than 3.3 billion euros ($4.9 billion) last year, with display ad revenue accounting for 1.2 billion euros of the total, the authority said.

The investigation comes a week after the U.S. Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, including allegations that the company’s “exclusionary” conduct stifles competition in search advertising, thus harming advertisers. Last year, EU regulators fined Google 1.49 billion euros for freezing out rivals in the online ad market.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/zhouow/article32970571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/google-italian-regulatorjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/italian-regulator-investigates-google-over-digital-ads/article32970555.ece
7,2020/10/29,France's online ad lobbies file antitrust complaint against Apple,"The four associations - IAB France, MMAF, SRI and UDECAM - said the changes brought by Apple did not meet European Union privacy rules

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Four French online advertising lobbies have filed an antitrust complaint against Apple over changes the iPhone maker will make to privacy features within the next version of its mobile operating system, they said in a statement on Wednesday.

Under the new Apple operating software, iOS 14, iPhone owners will be asked whether they're ready to allow installed mobile apps to gather a key identifier used to define campaign ads and send targeted ads.

The four associations - IAB France, MMAF, SRI and UDECAM - said the changes brought by Apple did not meet European Union privacy rules. They added Apple failed to hold itself to the same standards, as it would still be able to send targeted ads to iOS users without asking them for prior consent.

“This case is not about privacy; it is about Apple abusing its market power to distort competition,” the four associations said in a joint statement.

The opt-in permission is to be registered via a pop-up box from early 2021.

“With iOS 14, we're giving users the choice whether or not they want to allow apps to track them by linking their information with data from third parties for the purpose of advertising, or sharing their information with data brokers,” Apple said in a statement.

“We believe privacy is a fundamental human right and support the European Union's leadership in protecting privacy with strong laws such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation),” it said.

The new iOS 14 privacy features could lead to severe revenue decline for publishers and drive many ad tech vendors out of business, the four associations said.

The joint complaint was filed with France's antitrust competition authority. A spokeswoman for the authority confirmed the regulator had received the complaint, which is now being reviewed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/u5ju94/article32970152.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AppleantitrustFrance,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/frances-online-ad-lobbies-file-antitrust-complaint-against-apple/article32970061.ece

Apple has accelerated work to develop its own search engine that would allow the iPhone maker to offer an alternative to Google, a Financial Times report said Wednesday.

The report, citing unnamed sources, said signs of the search engine technology have begun to appeal in its iOS 14 operating system.

The move comes amid increased scrutiny by antitrust enforcers, who sued Google in the United States over its dominance in search technology.

As part of the lawsuit, the Department of Justice noted that Google pays Apple billions of dollars to be the principal search engine on iOS devices.

Apple did not immediately respond to an AFP query. Reports in the past have said Apple had begun some in-house research on creating a search engine.

According to the FT, Apple two years ago hired Google's head of search, John Giannandrea, in a move designed to help build artificial intelligence capabilities and its Siri virtual assistant.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/ervwre/article32862397.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Applefortnite,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/apple-developing-search-engine-to-compete-with-google-report/article32967612.ece

11,2020/10/29,DHS to gather public opinion on H-1B Visa allocation issue,"Some 1.84 lakh or 67% of the total H-1B highly-skilled work visas were granted to Indians as of April this year, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will gather public opinion on the H-1B visa allocation issue and interested parties will have 30 days to submit comments relevant to the proposed rule and 60 days to submit comments relevant to the proposed information collection, as per a statement posted on its website.

Indian techies have been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa programme. Some 1.84 lakh or 67% of the total H-1B highly-skilled work visas were granted to Indians as of April this year, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data.

DHS will open a public comment period once the NPRM is published in the Federal Register The Department will review all properly submitted comments, consider them carefully, and draft responses before issuing a final rule, it said.

“The current use of random selection to allocate H-1B visas makes it harder for businesses to plan their hiring, fails to leverage the H-1B programme to truly compete for the world’s best and brightest, and hurts American workers by bringing in relatively lower-paid foreign labour at the expense of the American workforce,” said Ken Cuccinelli, Acting Deputy Secretary, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

DHS has announced the transmission to the Federal Register of a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that would prioritise the selection of H-1B registrations (or petitions, if the registration process is suspended) based on corresponding wage levels in order to better protect the economic interests of U.S. workers, while still allowing U.S. employers to meet their personnel needs and remain globally competitive, said the statement.

Modifying the H-1B cap selection process by replacing the random selection process with a wage-level-based selection process is a better way to allocate H-1Bs when demand exceeds supply, said DHS. If finalized as proposed, this new selection process would incentivize employers to offer higher wages or petition for positions requiring higher skills and higher-skilled workers instead of using the program to fill relatively lower-paid vacancies, it further said.

“With this proposed rule, the Trump administration is continuing to deliver on its promise to protect the American worker while strengthening the economy. The H-1B programme is often exploited and abused by U.S. employers, and their U.S. clients, primarily seeking to hire foreign workers and pay lower wages,” added Cuccinelli.

This effort would only affect H-1B registrations submitted by prospective petitioners seeking to file H-1B cap-subject petitions.

President Donald Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden will rally supporters on Thursday in the battleground of Florida, visiting the same city hours apart and putting on full display their contrasting approaches to the resurgent coronavirus pandemic.

Opinion polls show Mr. Biden with a significant edge nationally, but his lead is tighter in battleground States. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday showed Mr. Trump had essentially moved into a tie with Mr. Biden in Florida, with 49% saying they would vote for Biden and 47% for the President.

With its 29 electoral votes, the State is a major prize in next Tuesday's election.

Mr. Trump will stage an outdoor rally in Tampa. Thousands of people have crowded together at recent Trump rallies, many eschewing masks despite public health recommendations.

Mr. Biden, in contrast, will hold a drive-in rally later in Tampa where attendees will remain in their cars. He will host a similar event earlier in the day in Broward County in South Florida.

In the days leading up to the election, the pandemic that has upended life across the U.S. this year, killing more than 2,27,000 people and causing millions of job losses, is roaring back.

Handling the pandemic

Mr. Trump this week has repeatedly dismissed the threat of the pandemic, claiming that his rivals and the news media would cease paying attention to it after the election.

In the poll, 48% of voters said Mr. Biden would be better at handling the pandemic, while 42% said Mr. Trump would be better. Some 52% said Mr. Trump would be better at managing the economy, against 41% for Biden.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qk5yxq/article32975558.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-US-VOTE-FLORIDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-biden-to-take-campaign-battle-to-florida/article32975559.ece
13,2020/10/29,China is gravest threat to religious freedom: Pompeo,"Pompeo has kept attacks on Beijing the focus of his Asia trip

China is the “gravest threat” to the future of religious freedom, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday, in his latest verbal assault on Beijing during a whirlwind Asian tour.

Mr. Pompeo has made attacks against China the focus of his trip this week which kicked off in India and included visits to Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Indonesia and, later Friday, Vietnam.

Crackdown on Uighur

In Indonesia — which has the world’s biggest Muslim population — Mr. Pompeo took aim at China’s treatment of its Uighur Muslim minority.

“The gravest threat to the future of religious freedom is the Chinese Communist Party’s war against people of all faiths: Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, and Falun Gong practitioners alike,” Mr. Pompeo said in a speech on Thursday to major Muslim organisation the Nahdlatul Ulama.

“The atheist Chinese communist party has tried to convince the world that its brutalisation of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang is necessary as counter-terrorism or poverty alleviation,” he added.

Rights groups say that more than one million Uighurs languish in camps in the Xinjiang region as Beijing attempts to forcibly integrate the community and root out its Islamic heritage.

China has denied the numbers and describes the camps as vocational centres that teach skills to prevent the allure of Islamic radicalism.

“But we know that there is no counter-terrorism justification in forcing Uighur Muslims to eat pork during Ramadan, or destroying a Muslim cemetery,” Mr. Pompeo said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lqrh19/article32975514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-US-DIPLOMACY-POMPEO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-is-gravest-threat-to-religious-freedom-pompeo/article32975515.ece
14,2020/10/29,30 years since the eviction of Muslims by LTTE,"No collective acknowledgement yet of the expulsion of northern Muslims, says activist

Thirty years may have passed since the LTTE evicted northern Muslims overnight, but the ordeals of the community, most of whom moved to Puttalam district in the North-Western Province, have not ceased, according to Juwairiya Mohideen.

The senior Sri Lankan activist, whose family was displaced from Mannar in the Northern Province to Puttalam — three hours north of Colombo — has spent the last three decades working with the internally displaced community. Recognising her work, Ireland-based international human rights organisation Front Line Defenders recently honoured her with an award for ‘Human Rights Defenders at Risk’.

When planned moves to new cities or towns can be a logistical nightmare, being forced to leave abruptly — leaving behind one’s home, belongings, assets and means of livelihood — couldn’t have been simple. For two weeks beginning mid-October in 1990, the LTTE undertook a mass expulsion of resident Muslims in the north, at gun point, amid growing hostilities between the two Tamil-speaking minority communities in the north and east. Like Ms. Mohideen’s family — her parents, grandmother and eight siblings — most left with just the little money they had in hand.

“Till date, there has been no collective acknowledgement of this act of ethnic cleansing, except from some individuals. Neither the political leadership nor successive governments have addressed this issue,” says Ms. Mohideen, 52, executive director of the Muslim Women’s Development Trust (MWDT), which she founded in 2010.

Bureaucratic hurdles

Some 70,000 people had no choice but to build their lives from scratch in Puttalam or elsewhere. “When some original residents of Puttalam, including Muslims, refer to us, they call us refugees,” Ms. Mohideen notes. “They fear we are after all their natural resources.”

From education and employment to housing and toilets, everything has proved a struggle for the northern Muslims trying to make Puttalam their home. A majority work for a daily wage in small vegetable farms or at the salterns in the coastal district. While a few hundred families have returned to Jaffna with great difficulty, others have chosen to remain in Puttalam, where their families have grown. “But getting an official document or attestation is a big challenge. The officers at the local authorities invariably direct these families to Jaffna or Mannar, where we are from. And when they go there, they are told their records don’t’ exist,” says Ms. Mohideen, of the many bureaucratic challenges faced by a community seen to be “neither here nor there”.

In any case, the displaced Muslims have had little success in making it to any updated official record, she points out, referring to the ambiguity over the number of displaced Muslims currently living in Puttalam. Rather critical of the Muslim parties and its leaders, she says those in Parliament are “more prone to opportunistic politics” than any long-term vision for the community, based on rights and freedoms. “Even when Muslims were attacked [by Sinhala Buddhist chauvinist groups] in the recent past, they would turn up for a media sound bite, and then never care to follow up,” she says. Further, Muslim leaders, in her view, have shown little interest in appreciating Muslim women’s calls to reform personal law.

Emphasising the “huge task of pending reconciliation,” she says strengthening relations between the country’s Tamil and Sinhalese communities, as well as Tamils and Muslims, needs a host of initiatives, including addressing the “language barrier”. “Barring a handful, most politicians from all our communities are so disconnected from their own constituencies, that they are unable to do anything meaningful.”

All the same, women’s networks built by her and fellow activists over the years across communities are intact and offer hope, she says. “For instance, conversations in these groups helped us differentiate the LTTE that evicted us from ordinary Tamil people. We realised that the Tamil people’s solidarity is crucial. We need to build and strengthen solidarity networks with such people in all communities. There is a lot of work to be done,” she says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yr90qe/article32975495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Juwairiya-Mohideen,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/30-years-since-the-eviction-of-muslims-by-ltte/article32975496.ece
15,2020/10/29,France raises threat level to highest,"PM says the govt. response to attack would be firm and implacable; soldiers to be doubled: Macron

France has raised the security alert for French territory to the highest level after the knife attack in the city of Nice, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Thursday.

Mr. Castex also told French National Assembly that the government’s response to the attack would be firm and implacable.

In Paris, lawmakers in the National Assembly observed a minute’s silence in solidarity with the victims of the terror attack. The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said the people of Nice “can count on the support of the city of Paris and of Parisians”.

French President, who visited the scene of a knife attack on Thursday, said he would be stepping up the deployment of soldiers to protect key sites, such as places of worship and schools.

Police said three people were confirmed to have died in the attack and several were injured. The French anti-terrorist prosecutor’s department said it had been asked to investigate.

A police source said a woman was decapitated. French far-right politician Marine Le Pen also spoke of a decapitation having occurred in the attack.

A representative of the French Council for the Muslim Faith strongly condemned the attack. “As a sign of mourning and solidarity with the victims and their loved ones, I call on all Muslims in France to cancel all the celebrations of the holiday of Mawlid.” The holiday is the birthday of the Prophet Mohammad, celebrated on Thursday.

Egypt’s al-Azhar, the 1,000-year-old seat of Sunni Muslim learning, condemned the incident as a “hateful terrorist attack” and warned against “violent and hate speech” in a reference to the display of images in France of the Prophet Mohammad.

Mr. Estrosi said the victims had been killed in a “horrible way”.

Similar methods

“The methods match, without doubt, those used against the brave teacher in Conflans Sainte Honorine, Samuel Paty,” he said, referring to the teacher beheaded earlier this month in an attack in a Paris suburb.

France is still reeling from that killing by a man of Chechen origin, who said he wanted to punish Paty for showing pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed to his pupils.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/on8uz6/article32975447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-APTOPIXFRANCEATTACK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/france-raises-threat-level-to-highest/article32975448.ece
16,2020/10/29,China’s People’s Liberation Army upgrading troops quarters for winter,"China’s Ministry of Defence, however, did not directly link plans to on-going LAC standoff.

China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on Thursday outlined plans to upgrade the living conditions along the border of its troops in high-altitude areas through the winter, suggesting that it was preparing for a long haul amid continuing tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

Talks between the Corps Commanders discussing disengagement on the LAC have made little progress after seven rounds, with an agreement to not add troops but a continuing stalemate on any consensus to disengage.

On Thursday, PLA Senior Colonel Wu Qian, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence, outlined the plans for what he called “improvement of border defence troops’ training and living conditions on [the Tibetan plateau] by high-tech applications”.

This included, he said, new accommodation with “a self-energised insulated cabin” that would in areas “where the outdoor temperature is -40℃ with an elevation of above 5,000m [keep] the indoor temperature at higher than 15℃.” The new cabins, he said, would also have installed “new thermal insulation devices for food storage”.

He did not directly link the new plans to the ongoing LAC standoff but said, “the logistic support capabilities are directly connected with the combat effectiveness.”

“The application of high-tech means,” he said, “will facilitate the construction of logistic support capacity and promote the troops’ war preparation work.”

2+2 Delhi dialogue

On Tuesday’s 2+2 ministerial dialogue in New Delhi between the foreign and defence ministers of India and the U.S., Senior Colonel Wu reiterated the Chinese foreign office’s statement from earlier this week, saying China “believes that the development of U.S.-India relations should help maintain regional peace and stability and should not be directed at any other country.”

China’s Foreign Ministry also hit out at comments made by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Delhi criticising the Communist Party of China and pledging support to India on the boundary issue, accusing the U.S. of looking to interfere in a “bilateral"" dispute.

Its statements have, so far, not mentioned India, only directing ire at Washington. On Thursday, the PLA too took aim at the U.S.. “Regarding the so-called U.S. alliance system, this is a product of the Cold War period, which embodies the outdated Cold War mentality and the zero-sum game concept,” Senior Colonel Wu said. “China has always firmly opposed this.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/togvgq/article32975084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WUQIAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pla-outlines-winter-plans/article32975085.ece
17,2020/10/29,U.K.’s Labour party suspends ex-leader Jeremy Corbyn after anti-Semitism failings exposed,"Jeremy Corbyn’s tenure was marred by persistent complaints of anti-Semitism in the party and criticism of the leader’s response

Britain’s Opposition Labour party suspended its former leader Jeremy Corbyn on October 29 for seeking to deflect blame away from himself after a report found that under his leadership the party was responsible for unlawful harassment and discrimination.

Mr. Corbyn’s successor, Keir Starmer, apologised and said the Labour was facing a “day of shame” after the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) found serious failings in how the party had dealt with allegations of anti-Semitism within its ranks.

Mr. Corbyn’s tenure was marred by persistent complaints of anti-Semitism in the party and criticism of the leader’s response.

He was suspended after saying he did not accept all the report’s findings, that his attempts at reforming complaints processes had been stalled by “obstructive party bureaucracy” and that the scale of the problem had been overstated for political reasons.

“In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation,” the Labour party said in a statement.

The party added it had removed the Labour whip from Mr. Corbyn, meaning that the former leader will no longer be able to take part in House of Commons votes as a Labour lawmaker.

Mr. Starmer said he accepted the EHRC’s report “in full” and would implement all its recommendations.

“It is a day of shame for the Labour Party. We have failed Jewish people... I am truly sorry for all the pain and grief that has been caused,” said Mr. Starmer, who held a senior role under Mr. Corbyn’s leadership but has tried to stamp out the problem since taking over.

“Never again will we fail to tackle anti-Semitism and never again will we lose your trust.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y8syw5/article32974051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-JEREMYCORBYN-REUTERS-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uks-labour-party-suspends-ex-leader-jeremy-corbyn-after-anti-semitism-failings-exposed/article32974052.ece

Our success in Pulwama, is a success of this nation under the leadership of Imran Khan,” Science & Technology Minister Fawad Chaudhry told the National Assembly.

In a sensational admission, a senior Pakistani Minister on Thursday admitted that Pakistan was responsible for the Pulwama terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 that killed 40 CRPF personnel and brought the two countries to the brink of a war.

“Humne Hindustan ko ghus ke maara (We hit India in their home). Our success in Pulwama, is a success of this nation under the leadership of Imran Khan. You and us are all part of that success,” Science & Technology Minister Fawad Chaudhry said in the National Assembly during a debate.

Mr. Chaudhry, a close aide of Prime Minister Imran Khan, made the remarks a day after Opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Ayaz Sadiq said that Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in an important meeting pleaded to release Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27, 2019 after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets.

In the early hours of February 26, 2019, the IAF jets bombed the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror camps in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan and avenged the Pulwama terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel.

Mr. Chaudhry, who was the information and broadcasting minister at the time of the Pulwama attack, criticised Sadiq’s remarks and termed them as “inappropriate”.

A statement from the Mecca region’s police said the guard suffered “minor injuries” and that “legal action” was being taken against the perpetrator.

The French Embassy said the consulate was subject to an ”attack by knife which targeted a guard”, adding the guard was taken to hospital and his life was not in danger.

“The French Embassy strongly condemns this attack against a diplomatic outpost which nothing could justify,” it said in a statement.

The attack occurred after a knife-wielding man shouting ”Allahu Akbar” beheaded a woman and killed two other people in the French city of Nice earlier in the day. Nice’s mayor described the attack as terrorism.

France is still reeling from the beheading earlier this month of a school teacher by a man of Chechen origin. The attacker had said he wanted to punish the teacher for showing pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a civics lesson.

Since Samuel Paty’s killing, French officials have reasserted the right to display the cartoons as a matter of free expression, and the images have been widely displayed at marches in solidarity with the teacher.

That has stirred anger in parts of the Muslim world, with some governments accusing French President Emmanuel Macron of pursuing an anti-Islam agenda.

21,2020/10/29,"Typhoon, landslides leave 35 dead, dozens missing in Vietnam","Officials said the death toll across the country may rise.

The immediate focus for rescuers was on three villages in the country’s central region where landslides killed at least 19 people and are suspected of burying more than 40 others in thick mud and debris.

Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung traveled to the site of one landslide where soldiers were working to clear debris with bulldozers and he ordered officers to urgently send more troops to help with the efforts.

“We must reach the landslide site the fastest way. First, send in more soldiers before we can get the big machine there. We have to reach the area by all means, including by using helicopters,” he said.

Also among the dead were 12 fishermen whose boats sank Wednesday as Typhoon Molave approached with winds of up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour. Another 14 fisherman were still missing.

Officials said the death toll across the country may rise as some regions have been unable to report details of damage and casualties.

Rescuers dug up eight bodies Thursday morning in Tra Van village in Quang Nam province where a hillside collapsed on houses. The victims had taken shelter in the community as the typhoon approached, the official Vietnam News Agency reported.

In Tra Leng village, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) from Tra Van, another landslide buried a community with several houses occupied by about 45 people. Four people escaped, while rescuers recovered eight bodies and later pulled out four villagers alive, including two children, who were trapped in a buried house, Vietnam News said.

The survivors pulled from the thick brown debris were brought to a hospital with arm and leg fractures and other injuries. Rescuers continued a frantic search for at least 33 others believed to be buried.

Tra Leng was initially inaccessible due to damaged roads, flooding and other landslides but by Thursday afternoon government disaster-response teams were able to open up a road with bulldozers and excavators and brought in more rescuers and heavy equipment.

As troops scrambled to rescue those buried alive in Tra Leng, another part of a rain-soaked mountainside cascaded down in a torrent of mud in nearby Phuoc Loc district, killing three people and trapping 11, Vietnam News said.

Other villagers in Phuoc Loc were advised to flee to safety given the unstable mountain slope.

The three landslide-hit areas lie in the mountains of hard-hit Quang Nam province in a coastal region still recovering from floods that killed 136 people and destroyed hundreds of houses earlier this month.

Quang Nam, a tourist draw for an ancient town and Hindu temples, is about 800 kilometers (500 miles) southeast of Hanoi.

Elsewhere, four people were killed by falling trees and collapsed houses in Quang Nam and Gia Lai provinces when the typhoon slammed into the coast Wednesday.

Navy search and rescue boats found the bodies of 12 of 26 fishermen whose boats sank Wednesday off Binh Dinh province, state media said.

The typhoon blew off roofs of about 56,000 houses and caused a massive blackout in Quang Ngai province, where 1.7 million people endured the onslaught of the typhoon overnight in darkness, according to Vietnam News.

At least 40,000 people were evacuated to emergency shelters and authorities shut down offices, factories and schools to prevent casualties.

22,2020/10/29,Polish President Andrzej Duda backtracks on abortion view amid protests,"He spoke after seven straight days of huge protests across Poland following a constitutional court ruling.

Poland’s President Andrzej Duda said on Thursday that women themselves should have the right to abortion in case of congenitally damaged fetuses, apparently breaking ranks with a conservative leadership that pushed a ban that has led to mass street protests.

It cannot be that the law requires this kind of heroism from a woman, Mr. Duda said in an interview with radio RMF FM.

He spoke after seven straight days of huge protests across Poland following a constitutional court ruling declaring it unconstitutional to terminate a pregnancy due to fetal congenital defects. The ruling effectively bans almost all abortions in a country that already had one of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws.

That ruling has triggered huge nationwide protests, with young people heeding a call by women’s rights activists to come to the streets to defend their freedoms.

Deep divisions that had been brewing for a long time in Poland are now erupting on the streets.

Men with a far-right group, All-Polish Youth, had attacked women taking part in protests overnight in some cities, including Wroclaw, Poznan and Bialystok.

Their actions came after Poland’s most powerful politician, ruling party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, called for his supporters to turn out on the streets to defend churches after women disrupted Masses last Sunday and spray-painted churches.

Many interpreted Kaczynski’s call as permission for violence against the protesters.

Mr. Duda’s comments on Thursday were in sharp contrast to his initial reaction last week, when he welcomed the ruling, and stressed his opposition to abortion even when a fetus is irreversibly damaged.

He also signalled a difference of opinion with Kaczynski on the issue of security, saying police should have the sole responsibility for protecting the streets.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ekbvfs/article32972363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANDRZEJDUDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/polish-president-andrzej-duda-backtracks-on-abortion-view-amid-protests/article32972364.ece
23,2020/10/29,What’s behind the Erdogan-Macron spat?,"While the immediate trigger was the Charlie Hebdo cartoons and Macron’s push to “reform” Islam, there is a larger geopolitical context to the rising tensions between Turkey and France.

The story so far: Relations between France and Turkey, two NATO members, hit a new low this month after Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched a personal attack on his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron following the latter’s call for reforming Islam. Last week, France recalled its Ambassador from Turkey, for the first time, and Ankara called for a boycott of French goods. Several other Muslim countries, including Pakistan, voiced protests against Mr. Macron.

What triggered the latest tensions?

Turkey and France have clashed over a number of geopolitical issues in recent years. The trigger for the latest clash was the French government’s support for Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine whose office was attacked by al-Qaeda-linked jihadists in January 2015 over its publication of a set of caricatures of Prophet Mohammed, to republish the cartoons. Ankara, under Mr. Erdogan’s Islamist Justice and Development Party, has projected itself as a defender of (selective) Muslims causes worldwide, and had slammed Mr. Macron earlier over his push to “reform” Islam in France.

On October 16, Samuel Paty, a middle school history teacher in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, a suburb of Paris, was beheaded by an 18-year-old Chechen refugee after he showed his students caricatures of the Prophet in a class on free speech. Following Paty’s murder, the French government started an operation to crack down on Islamist organisations, and President Macron, a strong defender of French secularism (laicite) and the freedom of speech, stated that Islam was in need of an “enlightenment”. While paying homage to Paty, government buildings in several cities displayed the caricatures of the Prophet. While the French response triggered criticism in Muslim countries, Mr. Erdogan launched the sharpest attack on Mr. Macron, saying he “needs mental treatment”. In response, France recalled its Ambassador from Turkey.

What’s Macron’s reform plan?

In early October, Mr. Macron outlined the substance of a long-awaited law which his government is planning to introduce to regulate the practice of Islam in France. In September, after Charlie Hebdo republished the cartoons when the trial of the suspected 14 accomplices of the terrorists who attacked the magazine office in 2015 and killed 12 journalists began, Mr. Macron had defended blasphemy, saying “the right to caricature is an essential part of being French”. On October 3, while unveiling the essence of the Bill, which the government plans to formally present in December, the President said the law was being brought in to fight “Islamist separatism”, which is a “conscious, theorised, politico-religious project that materialises through repeated deviations from the values of the republic and which often result in the creation of a counter-society”. It will crack down on foreign influence in French Muslim communities (the country’s largest religious minority) and allow the government to track funding for mosques from overseas. The government will also create a certificate programme for the imams and ban homeschooling.

Who supports whom?

While Mr. Macron is trying to sell his push for reform as an antidote to the growing Islamist violence in France (the country saw some 36 terrorist attacks in the past eight years that killed hundreds), many of his critics see the French President taking the battle against terrorism to Islam—something which the French far-right already does openly. This offers an opportunity for leaders like Mr. Erdogan, the votaries of political Islam, to attack the “hypocrisy” of the West in dealing with Islam. Mr. Erdogan’s call to boycott French goods gained support in several Muslim-majority countries. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan accused Mr. Macron of “attacking Islam”. Bangladesh saw a demonstration of thousands against the French government and Mr. Macron. Saudi Arabia, a regional rival of Turkey, joined hands with it in rejecting “any attempt to link Islam with terrorism”. On the other side, the U.K. and EU leaders offered support to Mr. Macron. India, which enjoys close defence and strategic partnership with France, issued a statement on Wednesday, condemning the personal attacks against Mr. Macron. “We strongly deplore the personal attacks in unacceptable language on President Emmanuel Macron in violation of the most basic standards of international discourse,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in the statement.

Is there a geopolitical angle?

While the immediate trigger was the Charlie Hebdo cartoons and Mr. Macron’s push to “reform” Islam, there is a larger geopolitical context to the rising tensions between Turkey and France. As Turkey, under Mr. Erdogan, is trying to expand its influence to the erstwhile Ottoman territories, France has stood in its way. In Libya, where Turkey is backing the Tripoli-based internationally-recognised government, France has supported the Tobruk-based parallel government and the military campaign of the renegade General Khalifa Haftar against Tripoli. In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Turkey has launched a gas exploration mission, clashing with Greece and Cyprus, while France threw its weight behind the fellow EU members and even sent French warships to the region. In the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, Turkey offered unconditional support to the Azeri military offensive, while Mr. Macron slammed Ankara’s “reckless and dangerous” intervention. In all these cases, France and Turkey emerged as two opposing poles in the West and the East, respectively.

24,2020/10/29,Three dead as woman beheaded in knife attack at French church,"France raises security threat level to highest, says PM Jean Castex

A knife-wielding attacker shouting “Allahu Akbar” beheaded a woman and killed two other people in a suspected terrorist attack at a church in the French city of Nice on Thursday, police and officials said.

Nice's mayor, Christian Estrosi, who described the attack as terrorism, said on Twitter it had happened in or near the city's Notre Dame church and that police had detained the attacker.

Mr. Estrosi said the attacker had shouted the phrase “Allahu Akbar”, or 'God is greatest'.

One of the people killed inside the church was believed to be the church warden, Mr. Estrosi said. The attacker kept shouting “Allahu Akbar” even after he had been detained, he added. “The suspected knife attacker was shot by police while being detained, he is on his way to hospital, he is alive,” Mr. Estrosi told reporters.

“Enough is enough,” Mr. Estrosi said. “It's time now for France to exonerate itself from the laws of peace in order to definitively wipe out Islamo-fascism from our territory”.

Security alert raised to highest level

France has raised the security alert for French territory to the highest level after the knife attack, Prime Minister Jean Castex said.

Mr. Castex also told French National Assembly that the government's response to the attack would be firm and implacable.

Police said three people were confirmed to have died in the attack and several were injured.

A police source said a woman was decapitated. French politician Marine Le Pen also spoke of a decapitation having occurred in the attack.

Mr. Estrosi said the victims had been killed in a “horrible way”.

“The methods match, without doubt, those used against the brave teacher in Conflans Sainte Honorine, Samuel Paty,” he said, referring to a French teacher beheaded earlier this month in an attack in a suburb of Paris. Mr. Estrosi said a woman had tried to escape from inside the church and had fled into a bar opposite the building.

Terrorism suspected

The French anti-terrorist prosecutor's department said it had been asked to investigate the attack.

Reuters journalists at the scene said police armed with automatic weapons had put up a security cordon around the church, which is on Nice's Jean Medecin avenue, the city's main shopping thoroughfare. Ambulances and fire service vehicles were also at the scene.

The attack comes while France is still reeling from the beheading earlier this month of French middle school teacher Paty by a man of Chechen origin.

The attacker had said he wanted to punish Paty for showing pupils cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in a civics lesson.

It was not immediately clear if Thursday's attack was connected to the cartoons, which Muslims consider to be blasphemous.

Since Paty's killing, French officials — backed by many ordinary citizens — have re-asserted the right to display the cartoons, and the images have been widely displayed at marches in solidarity with the killed teacher.

That has prompted an outpouring of anger in parts of the Muslim world, with some governments accusing French leader Emmanuel Macron of pursuing an anti-Islam agenda.

'Britain stands steadfast with France'

Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country stood steadfast with France.

“I am appalled to hear the news from Nice this morning of a barbaric attack at the Notre-Dame Basilica,” Mr. Johnson said on Twitter in both English and French.

25,2020/10/29,Myanmar leader Suu Kyi casts her vote in November elections,"Tens of thousands of citizens living overseas have also already cast their ballots.

Myanmar’s leader Aung San Suu Kyi cast her ballot Thursday in advance voting for general elections that are taking place during a surge of coronavirus illnesses.

The Southeast Asian country confirmed almost 1,500 new cases of infection on Wednesday alone.

Ms. Suu Kyi, whose title is state counsellor, and the country’s President, Win Myint, both wore masks and gloves as they voted in the capital Naypyitaw.

Measures are being taken to ensure social distancing at the polls on election day, Nov 8.

Advance voting is allowed and encouraged for citizens 60 years of age or older in areas where there are lock-down type restrictions because of the coronavirus, and in cases where people are staying for work in places other than their official homes. Ms. Suu Kyi is 75 and the president is 68.

Tens of thousands of citizens living overseas have also already cast their ballots.

The election commission has ruled that the polls will be held on the planned date despite the coronavirus crisis in several areas, a decision endorsed by Ms. Suu Kyi and her ruling National League for Democracy party. At least two dozen other parties had urged postponement.

The commission has also canceled voting in parts of Kachin state, Kayin state, Bago region, Mon state, Rakhine state, and Shan state, all of which are troubled by various levels of unrest.

The commission said free and fair voting could not be guaranteed in those areas, but the selective cancellation has drawn criticism. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said it had serious concerns about the human rights situation in Myanmar ahead of the elections, including violations of the right to political participation, particularly for minority groups.

While the elections represent an important milestone in Myanmar’s democratic transition, the civic space is still marred by continuing restrictions of the freedoms of opinion, expression and access to information, and the use of language that could amount to incitement to discrimination, hostility and violence, its statement said.

Ms. Suu Kyi, a former political prisoner who won the Nobel Peace Prize for leading the nonviolent pro-democracy movement, remains by far the country’s most popular politician.

The international condemnation of her government for allowing security forces to carry out widespread abuses of the Muslim Rohingya minority — driving more than 700,000 to seek safety in neighboring Bangladesh — appeared to play no significant role in the campaign.

26,2020/10/29,Pakistan anti-terrorism court acquits PM Imran Khan in 2014 Parliament attack case,"According to a report in the 'Dawn' newspaper, Prime Minister Khan’s acquittal comes after he this week urged the court to acquit him as the prosecution was no longer interested in pursuing the case.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was aquitted by an anti-terrorism court on Thursday in the 2014 Parliament attack case but other senior ministers, including Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, were summoned for indictment, according to media reports.

Anti-Terrorism Court Judge Raja Jawad Abbas Hassan, however, halted proceedings against President Arif Alvi due to the presidential immunity granted to him, The Express Tribune reported.

On August 31, 2014, workers of the now ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) marched towards the Parliament and Prime Minister’s House and clashed with police, killing 3 persons and injuring 26 others.

Police had invoked sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act against Mr. Khan and other PTI leaders.

According to a report in the Dawn newspaper, Prime Minister Khan’s acquittal comes after he this week urged the court to acquit him as the prosecution was no longer interested in pursuing the case.

The application filed by his lawyer stated that the prosecution was “not interested in prosecuting the applicant (Imran Khan)”.

“The applicant is maliciously implicated and dragged in this false case. Further proceedings shall cause harassment and political victimisation. Particularly, after the prosecution stands in favour of the acquittal of the applicant,” it said.

According to the counsel, not a single witness of the prosecution had linked the Prime Minister with the offence, adding that there was no direct or indirect evidence available on record against him, the report said.

Prosecution lawyers are appointed by the government and take instructions from it. The then prosecution team under the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government had fought the Parliament attack case but with a new team under the PTI government, the situation has changed, the Dawn report noted.

Judge Hassan summoned Foreign Minister Qureshi, Defence Minister Pervez Khattak, Education Minister Shafqat Mehmood and Planning Minister Asad Umar at the next hearing on November 12 for indictment.

Provincial Ministers Aleem Khan and Shaukat Yousafzai as well as PTI’s former secretary general Jahangir Tareen have also been summoned at the next hearing.

Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) worker Mubashir Ali has been acquitted in the case.

27,2020/10/29,FBI warns ransomware assault threatens US healthcare system,"In a joint alert Wednesday, the FBI and two federal agencies warned that they had credible information of an increased and imminent cybercrime threat to US hospitals and healthcare providers

Federal agencies warned that cybercriminals are unleashing a wave of data-scrambling extortion attempts against the US healthcare system designed to lock up hospital information systems, which could hurt patient care just as nationwide cases of COVID-19 are spiking.

In a joint alert Wednesday, the FBI and two federal agencies warned that they had credible information of an increased and imminent cybercrime threat to US hospitals and healthcare providers. The alert said malicious groups are targeting the sector with attacks that produce data theft and disruption of healthcare services.”

The cyberattacks involve ransomware, which scrambles data into gibberish that can only be unlocked with software keys provided once targets pay up. Independent security experts say it has already hobbled at least five US hospitals this week, and could potentially impact hundreds more.

The offensive by a Russian-speaking criminal gang coincides with the US presidential election, although there is no immediate indication they were motivated by anything but profit. We are experiencing the most significant cyber security threat we’ve ever seen in the United States, Charles Carmakal, chief technical officer of the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, said in a statement.

Also read | Cyberattack hobbles major U.S., U.K. hospital chain

Alex Holden, CEO of Hold Security, which has been closely tracking the ransomware in question for more than a year, agreed that the unfolding offensive is unprecedented in magnitude for the U.S. given its timing in the heat of a contentions presidential election and the worst global pandemic in a century.

The federal alert was co-authored by the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services.

The cybercriminals launching the attacks use a strain of ransomware known as Ryuk, which is seeded through a network of zombie computers called Trickbot that Microsoft began trying to counter earlier in October. U.S. Cyber Command has also reportedly taken action against Trickbot. While Microsoft has had considerable success knocking its command-and-control servers offline through legal action, analysts say criminals have still been finding ways to spread Ryuk.

The U.S. has seen a plague of ransomware over the past 18 months or so, with major cities from Baltimore to Atlanta hit and local governments and schools hit especially hard.

Also read | Microsoft attempts takedown of global criminal botnet

Holden said he alerted federal law enforcement Friday after monitoring infection attempts at a number of hospitals, some of which may have beaten back infections. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

He said the group was demanding ransoms well above $10 million per target and that criminals involved on the dark web were discussing plans to try to infect more than 400 hospitals, clinics and other medical facilities.

One of the comments from the bad guys is that they are expecting to cause panic and, no, they are not hitting election systems, Holden said. They are hitting where it hurts even more and they know it. U.S. officials have repeatedly expressed concern about major ransomware attacks affecting the presidential election, even if the criminals are motivated chiefly by profit.

Mandiant’s Carmakal identified the criminal gang as UNC1878, saying it is deliberately targeting and disrupting U.S. hospitals, forcing them to divert patients to other healthcare providers and producing prolonged delays in critical care.

Neither Holden nor Carmakal would identify the affected hospitals. Four healthcare institutions have been reported hit by ransomware so far this week, three belonging to the St. Lawrence County Health System in upstate New York and the Sky Lakes Medical Center in Klamath Falls, Oregon.

Sky Lakes acknowledged the ransomware attack in an online statement, saying it had no evidence that patient information was compromised. It said emergency and urgent care remain available The St. Lawrence system did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/2e3e6r/article31484580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THCACHERANSOMWARE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fbi-warns-ransomware-assault-threatens-us-healthcare-system/article32970270.ece
28,2020/10/29,Pompeo keeps China attacks going during Indonesia visit,"U.S. Secretary of State praises Indonesia’s leadership in ASEAN for pushing back China’s “unlawful” claims, lauds Jakarta’s protection of its own territory.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo renewed the Trump administration’s rhetorical onslaught against China in Indonesia on Thursday as the American presidential election looms.

With China a central theme in President Donald Trump’s campaign to win a second term in just five days time, Mr. Pompeo took aim at Chinese aggressiveness in the South China Sea, where it has advanced maritime and territorial claims over the objections of its smaller neighbors, and over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

Speaking in Jakarta, the headquarters of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Mr. Pompeo praised Indonesia’s leadership in ASEAN for pushing back on what he called China’s “unlawful” claims and lauded Jakarta’s protection of its own territory.

""We respect freedom of the seas, sovereignty and the rule of law,” he said, standing beside Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi. Ms. Marsudi agreed, saying “international law must be respected,” although she did not specifically mention China.

""Our law-abiding nations reject the unlawful claims by Chinese Communist Party in the South China Sea as is clear from Indonesia’s courageous leadership on this subject within ASEAN and at the United Nations,” Mr. Pompeo said. “It’s a cause worth pursuing in multilateral settings and the Trump administration very much supports this.”

Earlier this year, the Trump administration clarified its longstanding policy on the disputes by rejecting outright nearly all of Beijing’s maritime claims in the South China Sea. That decision in July came as Mr. Trump began a concerted effort to use China as a campaign cudgel against his Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, who he paints as weak on China and beholden to it.

Previously, U.S. policy had been to insist that maritime disputes between China and its smaller neighbors be resolved peacefully through U.N.-backed arbitration. But in a July 13 statement, Mr. Pompeo said the U.S. now regards virtually all Chinese maritime claims outside its internationally recognized waters to be illegitimate.

China has pressed ahead with attempts to enforce its disputed claims in the South China Sea, leading to serious spats with Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia in recent years. It has ignored arbitration rulings that the disputes must be negotiated.

In making the U.S. announcement, Mr. Pompeo said China cannot legally claim the James Shoal near Malaysia, waters surrounding the Vanguard Bank off Vietnam, the Luconia Shoals near Brunei or Natuna Besar off Indonesia. On Thursday, Mr. Pompeo said Indonesia’s protection of Natuna Besar was commendable.

Mr. Pompeo arrived in Indonesia from the Maldives, where he announced the United States would for the first time open an embassy in the Indian Ocean archipelago, a move that reflects growing U.S. concern about increasing Chinese influence in the region.

""The Chinese Communist Party continues its lawless and threatening behavior,” Mr. Pompeo said in Male, just hours after accusing China of being a “predator” during his previous stop in the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo.

""The Chinese Communist Party is a predator,” he said.

Responding to Mr. Pompeo’s remarks, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the Secretary of State’s true intention was to “let China fall back to an era of poverty and un-development, and let the world fall into the abyss of confrontation and division.”

""This is just the biggest threat facing the world today. But regrettably, Mr. Pompeo was born in the wrong time. The trend of peace, development, cooperation and win-win in this era is irresistible,” Mr. Wang told reporters.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y3xj7q/article32970265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THAPPOMPEOANDINDONESIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pompeo-keeps-china-attacks-going-during-indonesia-visit/article32970266.ece
29,2020/10/29,Pakistani clerics give approval to Hindu temple construction,"The decision by the Council of Islamic Ideology comes after the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan abruptly halted construction on the temple in the capital Islamabad in June.

Pakistan’s state-run council of clerics, which advises the government on religious issues, gave its approval on Wednesday to the construction of a new temple for minority Hindus, ruling Islamic law allows them a place of worship.

Lal Malhi, a prominent Hindu leader who is also a member of parliament, applauded the ruling but noted the council also recommended the government not spend public funds directly on the construction of private places of worship.

The decision by the Council of Islamic Ideology comes after the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan abruptly halted construction on the temple in the capital Islamabad in June.

Mr. Khan’s decision came amid threats from radical Muslims who called construction of the temple a blasphemous act.

Some extremists had vowed to try to stop the temple’s construction with force, raising tensions. Mr. Khan turned to the council to decide if public money could be used for construction. He had promised $600,000 for the temple’s construction.

It was not immediately clear on Wednesday whether Mr. Khan would follow through with providing the funds in light of the council’s ruling.

However, the council’s ruling left open the possibility the money could be distributed to the Hindu community to use as it sees fit.

Mr. Khan, who has promised equal rights for minorities, is expected to issue a formal order to allow the temple’s construction.

Currently, there is no functioning temple for Hindus in Islamabad. An ancient temple exists in the capital, but Hindus don’t use it for fear of attacks.

30,2020/10/29,South Korea's top court upholds 17-year jail term on ex-leader Lee Myung-bak,"The Supreme Court also confirmed a lower court ruling that ordered Lee Myung-bak to pay 13 billion won ($10.9 million) in fines and forfeit another 5.78 billion won ($4.6 million)

South Korea’s top court upheld a 17-year sentence imposed on former President Lee Myung-bak for a range of corruption crimes in a final ruling Thursday that will send him back to prison.

Lee has been convicted of taking bribes worth millions of dollars from big companies including Samsung, embezzling corporate funds of a company that he owned and misusing official funds of South Korea’s spy agency. The crimes occurred before and during his 2008-13 presidency.

The Supreme Court also confirmed a lower court ruling that ordered Lee to pay 13 billion won ($10.9 million) in fines and forfeit another 5.78 billion won ($4.6 million) for his crimes, court officials said. Thursday’s ruling is final and cannot be appealed.

Lee was initially sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2018. He was bailed out of jail several months later but was taken back into custody in February this year, after an appellate court handed down a 17-year term and canceled his bail. He was released again six days later after he appealed that ruling on his bail cancellation.

H was expected to return to prison later Thursday, according to the Supreme Court.

Lee, 78, was South Korea’s first-ever President with a business background and once symbolized the country’s economic rise. He began his business career with an entry-level job at Hyundai Group’s construction arm in the mid-1960s, before he rose to CEO of 10 companies under Hyundai Group and led the group’s rapid rise at a time when South Korea’s economy grew explosively after the 1950-53 Korean War.

Lee’s corruption case erupted after his successor and fellow conservative Park Geun-hye was ousted and sent to jail over a separate 2016-17 scandal. The back-to-back scandals badly wounded conservatives in South Korea and deepened a national divide.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ks2p82/article25131283.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN05SOUTHKOREACORRUPTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-koreas-top-court-upholds-17-year-jail-term-on-ex-leader/article32970257.ece
31,2020/10/29,Trump admin proposes to scrap computerised lottery system to select H-1B visas,"The Trump administration has proposed to scrap the computerised lottery system to grant H-1B work visas to foreign technology professionals and replace it with a wage-level-based selection process, a move that is expected to counter the downward pressure on the wages of US workers.

A notification on the new system is being published in the Federal Register on Thursday. Stakeholders have 30 days to respond to the notification, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said on Wednesday, less than a week before the US presidential election.

Replacing the computerised draw of lots to decide on the successful H-1B applicants, the DHS said it is expected to help counter the downward pressure on the wages of American workers that is created by an annual influx of relatively lower-paid, new cap-subject H-1B workers.

The H-1B visa, most sought-after among Indian IT professionals, is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.

If finalised as proposed, US Citizenship and Immigration Services would first select registrations (or petitions, if the registration process is suspended) generally based on the highest Occupational Employment Statistics prevailing wage level that the offered wage equals or exceeds for the relevant Standard Occupational Classification code and areas of intended employment.

Prioritisation and selection based on wage levels better balances the interests of petitioners, H-1B workers, and U.S. workers, the DHS said.

With this proposed rule, the Trump administration is continuing to deliver on its promise to protect the American worker while strengthening the economy. The H-1B programme is often exploited and abused by U.S. employers, and their U.S. clients, primarily seeking to hire foreign workers and pay lower wages, said Acting DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli.

US President Donald Trump, keen to regulate the country’s immigration policies, on June 22, signed the executive order temporarily banning issuing fresh H-1B and L-1 visas till December 31. Reforming America’s immigration regime is a major election promise of the Republican leader under his America First policy.

The current use of random selection to allocate H-1B visas makes it harder for businesses to plan their hiring, fails to leverage the H-1B programme to truly compete for the world’s best and brightest, and hurts American workers by bringing in relatively lower-paid foreign labour at the expense of the American workforce, Mr. Cuccinelli said.

According to the DHS, modifying the H-1B cap selection process by replacing the random selection process with a wage-level-based selection process is a better way to allocate H-1Bs when demand exceeds supply.

This new selection process would incentivise employers to offer higher wages or petition for positions requiring higher skills and higher-skilled workers instead of using the programme to fill relatively lower-paid vacancies.

The proposed changes would maintain the effective and efficient administration of the H-1B cap selection process while providing some prospective petitioners the ability to potentially improve their chance of selection by agreeing to pay H-1B beneficiaries higher wages that equal or exceed higher prevailing wage levels, it said.

This is necessary to further the administration’s goal of prioritising H-1B cap-subject registrations for petitioners seeking to employ higher-skilled and higher paid workers, which is more aligned with the general congressional intent for the H-1B programme, the DHS said.

According to the federal notification, prioritising wage levels in the registration selection process incentivises employers to offer higher wages, or to petition for positions requiring higher skills that commensurate with higher wage levels, to increase the likelihood of selection for an eventual petition.

Similarly, it disincentivises abuse of the H-1B programme to fill lower-paid, lower-skilled positions, which is a significant problem under the present selection system. With limited exceptions, H-1B petitioners are not required to demonstrate a labour shortage as a prerequisite for obtaining H-1B workers, it said.

The number of H-1B cap-subject petitions, including those filed for the advanced degree exemption, has frequently exceeded the annual H-1B numerical allocations.

For at least the last decade, USCIS has received more H-1B petitions than the annual H-1B numerical allocation in those respective years.

Since the fiscal 2014 cap season (April 2013), USCIS has received more H-1B petitions (or registrations) in the first five days of filing (or the initial registration period) than the annual H-1B numerical allocations.

The congressionally-mandated H-1B visa has an annual cap of 65,000 visas.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tczvjf/article32263809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/H1B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-admin-proposes-to-scrap-computerised-lottery-system-to-select-h-1b-visas/article32969730.ece
32,2020/10/29,"2020 U.S. Presidential election to be most expensive in history, expected to cost $14 billion","Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will be the first candidate in history to raise $1 billion from donors.

The 2020 Presidential election is turning out to be the most expensive election in history and twice as expensive as the previous presidential election cycle, with the total cost of the election expected to reach an unprecedented $14 billion, a research group said.

The Center for Responsive Politics said that an extraordinary influx of political donations in the final months — driven by a Supreme Court battle and closely watched races for the White House and Senate — pushed total spending in the election past the previously estimated 11 billion dollars figure.

The Center said that the 2020 election will cost $14 billion, shattering spending records.

Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden will be the first candidate in history to raise $1 billion from donors.

His campaign brought in a record-breaking $938 million through October 14, riding Democrats’ enthusiasm to defeat Trump. President Donald Trump raised $596 million, which would be a strong fundraising effort if not for Biden’s immense haul.

Even amid a pandemic, everyone is giving more in 2020, from ordinary individuals making small donations to billionaires cutting eight-figure checks to super PACs.

Women are smashing donation records, and Americans are increasingly donating to candidates who aren’t running for office in their state, it said in a statement.

The 2020 election is more than twice as expensive as the runner up, the 2016 election.

This year’s election will see more spending than the previous two presidential election cycles combined, said the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan, independent and nonprofit research group that tracks money in U.S. politics and its effect on elections and public policy.

Donors poured record amounts of money into the 2018 midterms, and 2020 appears to be a continuation of that trend — but magnified, said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics.

Ten years ago, a billion-dollar presidential candidate would have been difficult to imagine. This cycle, we’re likely to see two, Ms. Krumholz said.

The group said that the massive numbers are headlined by unprecedented spending in the presidential contest, which is expected to see $6.6 billion in total spending alone, up from around $2.4 billion in the 2016 race.

Spending by deep-pocketed national groups is also driving the total cost of election higher. In the month of October alone, outside spending by super PACs and other big-money groups totalled nearly $1.2 billion.

These groups are spending far more to boost Mr. Biden than help Mr. Trump, further aiding the Democrats cash-flush campaign.

Driven by their supporters’ strong opposition to Mr. Trump, Democrats are continuing their fundraising prowess that helped them dominate the money race in the 2018 election cycle.

“Their money machine is more powerful than ever in 2020,” the Center said.

Democratic candidates and groups have spent $5.5 billion compared to Republicans’ $3.8 billion, the Center said noting that Democrats have never had a financial advantage this large.

Both parties raised more than ever from small donors, but Democrats came out on top, having raised nearly $1.7 billion from bite-sized donors, compared to $1 billion for Republicans.

Overall, small donors account for 22 per cent of the money raised in the 2020 cycle. These individual donors giving $200 or less only accounted for 15 per cent of money raised in the 2016 election.

The pandemic also forced candidates to forgo in-person fundraisers with wealthy donors. Campaigns have increasingly relied on virtual fundraising using texts and emails, a strategy that works better when Americans are more engaged in politics, it said.

Political groups have spent over $1 billion this year to advertise on platforms like Facebook and Google, according to OpenSecrets’ online ads database.

Democrats are also raising more in large part because women are giving more.

More than 1.5 million women have donated to federal committees, accounting for 44% of all donors, up from 37% in 2016.

In the 2020 election, women have given $2.5 billion through mid-October, up from $1.3 billion throughout the entire 2016 election.

According to the Center’s research, women are more likely to be Democratic donors.

In the 2020 election, women giving over $200 have donated nearly $1.3 billion to Democrats and roughly $570 million to Republicans.

Several industries have flipped over to Democrats’ side under Trump’s presidency, including the well-funded miscellaneous finance and securities and investment industries.

Real estate is one of the few major industries to stay in Republicans’ corner during the Trump era, giving slightly more to GOP committees than Democrats, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/guxawk/article32816856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-965692014,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2020-us-presidential-election-to-be-most-expensive-in-history-expected-to-cost-14-billion/article32969375.ece

A former U.S. Department of Homeland Security official on Wednesday revealed he was the author of an anonymous 2018 New York Times op-ed and later book that excoriated President Donald Trump, stepping forward to urge Americans to vote against Mr. Trump.

Miles Taylor, chief of staff in the department until 2019, set tongues wagging in Washington with the editorial that called Mr. Trump amoral, petty and ineffective. He disclosed his identity on Wednesday in a statement on Medium, an online publishing platform, ahead of next week's presidential election.

“We alone must determine whether his behaviour warrants continuance in office, and we face a momentous decision, as our choice about Trumps future will affect our future for years to come,” wrote Mr. Taylor, a Republican who endorsed Mr. Trump's election opponent, Democrat Joe Biden.

“With that in mind, he doesn’t deserve a second term in office, and we don’t deserve to live through it.”

Mr. Trump responded on Wednesday evening, saying, “Anonymous was a nobody, a disgruntled employee who was quickly removed from his job a long time ago.”

Mr. Trump said he did not know Mr. Taylor and had “never even heard of him,” although Mr. Trump in August called Mr. Taylor a “lowlife.”

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany blasted Mr. Taylor as a “liar and a coward who chose anonymity over action and leaking over leading.”

Mr. Taylor, who described himself as part of the “resistance” within the Trump administration in the anonymous editorial, has also publicly criticised Mr. Trump.

The op-ed and book that followed it, called A Warning, caused brief flurries of attention, although they were overshadowed by a series of books written by well-known former Trump associates, both pro and con, who identified themselves as the authors of their work. Many had suspected Mr. Taylor was the anonymous author for months.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7y9dvr/article32969092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPANONYMOUSTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/former-us-homeland-security-official-says-he-wrote-anonymous-op-ed-on-trump/article32969093.ece
34,2020/10/29,U.K. under pressure as COVID-19 epidemic doubling every 9 days,"Scientists estimate that there are about 96,000 new cases every day

The British government is under pressure to develop a national strategy to combat a surge of COVID-19 cases and “rescue Christmas” as scientists warn that the number of people hospitalised with the disease in the U.K. could almost triple by the end of next month unless something more is done now.

Mark Walport, a former chief scientific officer, said Britain only needs to look across the English Channel to see what’s coming. Britain’s current measures are similar to those in France and Spain, where authorities are struggling to control the virus and daily cases have already far outstripped those in the U.K.

""With our current measures there’s little evidence that there is as much social distancing as there was when we clamped down on the first wave and so we know that the risk is significant that cases will continue to grow,” Mr. Walport told the BBC.

It is “not unrealistic” that 25,000 people in the U.K. could be hospitalised by the end of November — up from about 9,000 now, he said.

According to results from a large, ongoing study into the COVID-19 epidemic in England, scientists estimated that there are about 96,000 new cases every day and that the outbreak is doubling in size every nine days.

""The rate of growth we’re seeing is really quite rapid,” said Steven Riley, a professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London, one of the leaders of the study funded by the Department of Health.

Mr. Riley and colleagues took samples from more than 85,000 people randomly selected across England in late October and found that about one in every 128 people in England is infected with the coronavirus.

They reported that rates were increasing among all age groups, including those most at risk- they noted a tripling of COVID-19 rates in people aged 55 to 64 and a doubling in those over 65.

""Our data shows there’s no reason to expect that exponential rise to change for the next few weeks regardless of what we do,” Riley warned. “New cases will turn into hospitalizations.” He said it was unclear whether recently imposed restrictions in northern England would be enough to stop the spiraling spread of the virus.

Mr. Riley said that if politicians were considering more stringent measures, “the (study) results argue for something sooner rather than later,” adding that “something needs to change before Christmas.”

Dr. Paul Hunter of the University of East Anglia, who was not connected to the study, said it was “likely that infection rates now are very similar to and maybe even higher than at the peak in April.”

The World Health Organization said for the second consecutive week, the European region accounted for the biggest proportion of new infections, with more than 1.3 million cases or about 46% of the worldwide total. The U.N. health agency also said deaths were also on the rise in Europe, with about a 35% spike since the previous week, and hospitalizations and ICU occupancy due to COVID-19 increased in 21 countries across Europe.

Mr. Walport’s assessment came as two opposition parties called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to convene a summit of the U.K.’s four nations to develop a coordinated plan for combatting COVID-19.

Under the U.K.’s system of devolved government, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have all developed their own rules to fight the pandemic. Meanwhile, Johnson has implement a three-tiered regional strategy to applies only in England. That has a led to a patchwork of regulations that change from one nation to the next, and sometimes from city to city.

Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said the four nations must develop a unified strategy to avoid confusion and deliver a clear message. The Liberal Democrats and Northern Ireland’s Alliance Party have written to Johnson asking for a summit.

""I think they need to have some action now because otherwise, if we don’t get the virus back under control, I’m afraid there’s little chance of being able to rescue Christmas,” Mr. Davey told the BBC.

35,2020/10/29,Uproar as Ukraine constitutional court blocks anti-corruption laws,"The court ruled that criminal punishment for putting false information on state officials’ asset declarations was “excessive”.

Ukraine’s constitutional court on Wednesday said that a number of anti-corruption laws including on free public access to officials’ declarations were unconstitutional, sparking an uproar in the ex-Soviet country.

The court ruled that criminal punishment for putting false information on state officials’ asset declarations was “excessive”.

The National Agency for Preventing Corruption and anti-corruption campaigners condemned the move.

President Volodymyr Zelensky, a former comedian, came to power last year pledging sweeping political change and to root out corruption.

Rooting out corruption was also one of protesters’ top demands during a pro-European uprising in 2013-2014 and remains one of Western donors’ main demands.

“This is a crushing defeat for anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine,” Oleksandr Novikov, the head of the National Agency for Preventing Corruption, the main anti-graft body, said in a statement.

Following the ruling the agency will lose its right to check officials’ asset declarations and hold them accountable.

From now on “lawmakers, mayors, ministers and the president can put down any income they want and there will be no responsibility for this,” Novikov said.

Transparency International said the constitutional court’s ruling would lead to a “significant rollback” of Ukraine’s anti-corruption reforms.

“These legislative provisions were the cornerstones of the anti-corruption system, while corruption has been recognised (as) one of the threats to the national security,” said Andriy Borovyk, executive director of the anti-corruption watchdog’s Ukraine office.

After the popular uprising Western donors demanded tangible progress in Ukraine’s fight against corruption, and the authorities launched various anti-corruption bodies such as the National Agency for Preventing Corruption and the specialised court.

According to Transparency International, Ukraine ranked 126th out of 198 countries on the watchdog’s corruption perception index in 2019.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wfzuqf/article32968298.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UKRAINE-VOTE-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uproar-as-ukraine-constitutional-court-blocks-anti-corruption-laws/article32968299.ece
36,2020/10/29,"EU to allow Britain, U.S. in on future joint defence projects, envoys say","While the United States, the world’s biggest military power, has 30 weapons systems, the EU has 178. The bloc has 17 types of battle tank, compared to just one in the United States.

The European Union will allow non-members such as Britain and the United States to take part in future joint EU defence projects, but only on an exceptional basis, three EU diplomats said on Wednesday.

The decision resolves a long saga over whether Britain, which has left the bloc, could take part in a new EU defence pact, known as Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), which aims to help the EU fund, develop and deploy armed forces together. It will not amount to an EU military.

The breakthrough of an impasse which dates back to June 2018 also helps to revive EU defence integration efforts launched with great fanfare in December 2017, in part to show unity after Brexit, but which ran into bureaucratic hurdles.

In May this year, the European Commission made a long-awaited proposal to earmark 8 billion euros ($9.5 billion) of its next budget on a new, complementary EU defence fund, keeping alive a Franco-German desire to deepen military cooperation among EU nations that have long pursued independent projects.

While the United States, the world’s biggest military power, has 30 weapons systems, the EU has 178. The bloc has 17 types of battle tank, compared to just one in the United States.

“The rules on participation of non-members was the last missing piece of the puzzle,” a senior EU diplomat said of Wednesday’s decision, which will allow Britain and others, such as Norway and the United States, to take part in future projects to develop aircraft, helicopters and weapons.

Non-member participants will only be able to come in on individual projects and must bring substantial know-how, diplomats said. The decision does not affect U.S. defence contractors’ traditional access to bid for individual European military contracts in the EU.

However, Turkey, a NATO member and candidate to join the EU, is unlikely to be able to take part because of requirements in the EU defence pact that call for non members to “support and uphold European values”, a second diplomat said.

The Commission this month said Turkey was undermining its economy, eroding democracy and destroying independent courts, leaving its bid to join the EU further away than ever.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/oyq30y/article32967814.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BREXITAPEXPLAINS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eu-to-allow-britain-us-in-on-future-joint-defence-projects-envoys-say/article32967815.ece
37,2020/10/29,Belarus minister says police could use guns during protests,"In a YouTube interview released on Wednesday, Interior Minister Yuri Karayev said he thinks that police have been too tolerant of protesters and that they will take a tougher line.

The interior minister of Belarus warned that authorities wouldn’t hesitate to approve the use of live ammunition on protesters if it’s necessary to quash more than 2 1/2 months of demonstrations against the reelection of the country’s authoritarian president.

In a YouTube interview released on Wednesday, Interior Minister Yuri Karayev said he thinks that police have been too tolerant of protesters and that they will take a tougher line. He noted that many officers have been injured during the post-election unrest.

“A war is going on. There has been an open and blatant pressure fueled by impunity and lack of fear,” Karayev said.

“A police officer was nearly killed, he was being strangled but he only fired warning shots in the air,” the minister said, adding that he was working to change that attitude and was telling police that their lives depend “on how quickly you pull your gun.”

Since the country’s Aug. 9 presidential election, Belarus has been rocked by the largest and most sustained protests in President Alexander Lukashenko’s 26-year rule. Official election results gave him a landslide victory to a sixth term. The demonstrators have rejected the official results as a sham and demanded Lukashenko’s resignation.

Police detained thousands and brutally beat hundreds of peaceful protesters during the first few days of protests, triggering international outrage and prompting the U.S. and the European Union to introduce sanctions against Belarusian officials accused of vote fraud and the clampdown on demonstrations.

Lukashenko’s main election challenger, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who left for Lithuania under pressure from authorities after the vote, had urged a nationwide strike if Lukashenko did not resign, release political prisoners and stop the police crackdown.

She gave the go-ahead for the strike to begin Monday after police in Minsk and other cities once again dispersed demonstrators with stun grenades and tear gas. Sunday’s rally in Minsk was one of the largest in weeks, drawing nearly 200,000 people, according to a human rights center’s crowd estimate.

The strike, however, has failed to get enough traction to stymie production at major state-run plants and factories that make up the core of the Belarus economy. Some factory workers walked off the job, thousands of students and retirees marched in Minsk, and some small business owners closed their doors, but most state enterprises have continued to operate as usual.

Pavel Latushko, a former culture minister and ambassador to France who joined the opposition and was forced to leave the country, announced the creation of a new opposition structure to help a transition of power. He said it will work together with Tsikhanouskaya and the opposition’s Coordination Council.

Amid the pressure from protesters, Lukashenko has maneuvered to buy time by promising a constitutional overhaul that could trim his powers. The opposition has rejected his plan as a ruse to stifle protests.

Lukashenko spoke by telephone on Saturday with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Belarusian authorities afterward allowed Vitali Shkliarov, a Belarus-born U.S. citizen who had spent nearly three months in jail, to leave the country.

Pompeo tweeted Wednesday that Shkliarovrac}is “once again with his family andrac}safely in the United States.”

Shklyarov, a political consultant who also holds Russian and Belarusian passports, was arrested in late July while visiting his family in Belarus. Belarus’ State Security Committee, which still goes by the Soviet-era name KGB, accused him of conspiring to stage mass riots. He denied the accusation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4mwz84/article32967799.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BELARUSPROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/belarus-minister-says-police-could-use-guns-during-protests/article32967800.ece
38,2020/10/29,U.S. unseals charges over 2008 kidnapping of American journalist,"The department added that Najibullah, 44, was arrested and transferred to the United States from Ukraine where he will face trial.

The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday unsealed an indictment charging Haji Najibullah, an Afghanistan national, with six counts related to the 2008 kidnapping of an American journalist and two Afghan nationals.

The department added that Najibullah, 44, was arrested and transferred to the United States from Ukraine where he will face trial.

The indictment does not name the journalist, but a law enforcement official familiar with the matter told Reuters the case involves David Rohde, a former Reuters and New York Times correspondent now with the New Yorker who was kidnapped by the Taliban in 2008.

Najibullah is facing charges, including hostage taking, conspiracy to commit hostage taking, kidnapping, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, and two counts of using and possessing a machinegun in furtherance of crimes of violence.

Mark Gombiner, a Manhattan-based federal public defender listed in court records as Najibullah's lawyer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. David Rohde also did not respond to a request for comment.

The indictment says that in November 2008, Najibullah ”caused” a group of men carrying machine-guns to detain the Rohde and two Afghans who were helping him. Later, the indictment says, Najibullah and around six armed guards forced the journalist and the Afghans to hike across the border from Afghanistan into Pakistan.

The indictment says that in April 2009, while in Pakistan, Najibullah recorded a videos of the journalist begging for help while a machine-gun was pointed at his face.

39,2020/10/29,Philadelphia sets city-wide curfew amid violent protests,"The curfew will run through Thursday at 6 a.m., the officer of Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said in a statement.

Philadelphia will impose a city-wide curfew starting Wednesday at 9 p.m. to try to quell the looting and violence that marred two nights of protests over the police killing of a Black man who was under mental duress, the mayor's office said.

The curfew will run through Thursday at 6 a.m., the officer of Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said in a statement.

Tension has gripped the streets of Philadelphia since Monday's deadly police shooting of Walter Wallace, 27, who was armed with a knife and described by relatives as suffering from a mental breakdown, in a confrontation with law enforcement.

Philadelphia police have made 172 arrests and 53 officers have been injured in two nights of protests, according to the statement. Local TV coverage showed widespread looting of big-box stores and other businesses, some of which were still recovering from the unrest that swept the country in summer.

The demonstrations over Wallace's death have turned Philadelphia into the latest flashpoint in the United States on issues of race and police use of force just days ahead of Tuesday's presidential election.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who is seeking a second term in office, has made policing a top campaign issue, calling for a tough “law and order” stance on the protests. In Nevada on Wednesday, Trump called the events in Philadelphia “terrible” and offered to send federal help.

“What I'm witnessing is terrible and frankly that the mayor or whoever it is that's allowing people to riot, and loot and not stopping them is also just a horrible thing,” he said.

Philadelphia, which has a large Black population, is the largest city in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state in the race between Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden, who has said he supports the police but wants to address racial inequalities, among other issues.

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, said on Wednesday his administration stood ready to help the city with the unrest, including to “avoid unnecessary harm to businesses that provide services to affected neighborhoods.”

“We must address the systemic problems that cause tragedies against people of color,” Wolf said on Twitter.

On Tuesday, Wolf ordered several hundred National Guard officers to prepare to assist Philadelphia, although it can take 48 hours to mobilize for such an event, a spokesman said.

Tuesday's rallies began peacefully but grew confrontational as darkness fell, just as on the previous day.

Police turned out in force to cordon off a West Philadelphia commercial district that was looted the previous night.

But looters broke into businesses elsewhere, including in the city's Port Richmond section, aerial news video from WPVI television showed. At times, police in riot gear shoved protesters back from barricade lines.

The violence erupted despite the pleading of the dead man's father, Walter Wallace Sr., who on Tuesday urged people to “stop the violence” out of respect for his son and family.

“I don't condone no violence, tearing up the city, looting of the stores, and all this chaos,” he told reporters and a gathering of people. “It's an SOS to help, not to hurt.”

He also called for justice in a case still being investigated.

The unrest in Philadelphia follows that in other cities where police have killed Black men.

40,2020/10/29,‘Who the hell elected you?’ U.S. Senate tech hearing becomes election showdown,"Lawmakers are split on ways to hold Big Tech accountable under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - which protects companies from liability over content posted by users but also lets the firms shape political discourse.

A U.S. Senate hearing to reform an internet law and hold tech companies accountable for how they moderate content quickly turned into a political scuffle as lawmakers not only went after the companies but also attacked each other.

Lawmakers are split on ways to hold Big Tech accountable under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - which protects companies from liability over content posted by users but also lets the firms shape political discourse.

The chief executives of Twitter Inc, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google called the law crucial to free expression on the internet. They said Section 230 gives them the tools to strike a balance between preserving free speech and moderating content, even as they appeared open to suggestions the law needs moderate changes.

All three CEOs also agreed the companies should be held liable if the platforms act as a publisher but denied being the referees over political speech - a claim that angered some Republicans.

Senator Ted Cruz went after Twitter’s Jack Dorsey after the CEO said Twitter has no influence over elections.

“Who the hell elected you and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the American people are allowed to hear,” Cruz said, referring to the platform’s decision to block stories from the New York Post about the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Ahead of the hearing, the senator released a picture on Twitter titled “Free Speech showdown Cruz vs Dorsey” that showed him and Twitter’s Dorsey pitted against each other.

Democratic Senator Brian Schatz said he did not have any questions, calling the hearing “nonsense”. “This is bullying and it is for electoral purposes,” he said.

Other Democrats including Tammy Baldwin, Ed Markey and Amy Klobuchar also said the hearing was held to help President Donald Trump’s re-election effort.

Trump, who alleges the companies’ stifle conservative voices, and Republican lawmakers sent a flurry of tweets as the hearing continued. “Repeal Section 230!” Trump tweeted. Separately, Senator Josh Hawley took a jab at Twitter’s Dorsey. ”This level of idiocy confirms the widespread impression that Jack’s primary food source is weed.”

Twitter’s global vice president of communications Brandon Borrman said: “There’s nothing in the (Hawley) tweet that deserves a response.”

Twitter’s Dorsey warned the committee that eroding the foundation of Section 230 could significantly hurt how people communicate online. Pichai said Google operates without political bias and that doing otherwise would be against its business interests.

The committee was unable to establish contact with Facebook’s Zuckerberg and declared a short recess. He appeared shortly after and said: “I was having a hard time connecting myself.”

Zuckerberg said he supports changing the law but also warned that tech platforms are likely to censor more to avoid legal risks if Section 230 is repealed. Biden has expressed support for revoking the law.

No more “free pass”

Republican Senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the committee, said it was important to shield companies from liability without giving them the ability to censor content they dislike.

“The time has come for that free pass to end,” he said.

Wicker also criticized Twitter’s decision to block the New York Post stories about Biden’s son and Facebook’s move to limit their reach.

He and other senators such as Cory Gardner went after Twitter for not taking down tweets from world leaders that allegedly spread misinformation but going aggressively after Republican President Donald Trump’s tweets.

U.S. lawmakers are not the only ones pushing for reform.

41,2020/10/29,Coronavirus | Germany to go into circuit-break lockdown as cases surge,"Effective Nov. 2, private gatherings will be limited to 10 people from a maximum of two households. Restaurants, bars, theatres, cinemas, pools and gyms will be shut and concerts cancelled.

Germany will impose an emergency month-long lockdown that includes the closure of restaurants, gyms and theatres to reverse a spike in coronavirus cases that risks overwhelming hospitals, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday.

“We need to take action now,” she said, adding that the recent steep rise in infection numbers had generated sufficient political and public support for new tough measures to reduce social contacts and suppress outbreaks.

Effective Nov. 2, private gatherings will be limited to 10 people from a maximum of two households. Restaurants, bars, theatres, cinemas, pools and gyms will be shut and concerts cancelled.

Professional sports events will be allowed to be held only without spectators. People will be asked not to travel for private, non-essential reasons, and overnight stays in hotels will be available only for necessary business trips.

Schools and daycare centres will however remain open, as will shops, so long as they stick to social distancing and hygiene rules. The nationwide rules replace a confusing patchwork of regional measures.

To make the measures more palatable especially for smaller companies, Germany will offer financial aid to those hurt by the new restrictions.

Under a new 10-billion-euro ($11.82 billion) aid package, companies with up to 50 employees will receive 75% of their year-earlier revenues for the month of November.

In addition, self-employed workers such as artists and stage hands will receive access to emergency loans, and the government will expand an existing liquidity programme to give small firms with less than 10 employees access to very cheap loans.

Germany, with Europe's largest economy, was widely praised for keeping infection and death rates below those of many of its neighbours in the first phase of the crisis but is now in the midst of a second wave, like much of the rest of Europe.

Cases rose by 14,964 to 464,239 in the last 24 hours, Germany's infections diseases agency, the Robert Koch Institute, said on Wednesday.

Deaths jumped by 85 to 10,183, heightening fears for the health system after Merkel warned it could hit breaking point if infections continue to spiral.

“Our health system can still cope with this challenge today, but at this speed of infections it will reach the limits of its capacity within weeks,” the conservative chancellor said.

Merkel added that health authorities were no longer able to trace the origin of around 75% of infections, which made it difficult to say which measures exactly would have the most effective impact.

Germany is now counting on a four-week, partial shutdown to help flatten the curve of infections.

“Our hope is that if we manage to do this for four weeks, that we then have a chance to halt this dramatic development, that we have a chance to regain a bit of security,” Berlin mayor Michael Mueller said.

Merkel and Germany's 16 state government leaders will reconvene two weeks into the partial lockdown to assess how effective the measures decided on Wednesday are.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/91stfz/article32966974.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSGERMANY-MERKEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-germany-to-go-into-circuit-break-lockdown-as-cases-surge/article32966975.ece
42,2020/10/29,Police warn of tougher action as thousands join abortion protests in Poland,"Poland has been rocked by huge demonstrations, most of them peaceful, since its top court ruled last Thursday that abortion due to foetal abnormalities was not permissible under the constitution.

Thousands took to the streets across Poland on Wednesday for the seventh day of protests against a court ruling that further limits the country’s highly restrictive abortion laws.

Police warned demonstrators not to target churches again after some services were disrupted and buildings defaced in an earlier protest.

Poland has been rocked by huge demonstrations, most of them peaceful, since its top court ruled last Thursday that abortion due to foetal abnormalities was not permissible under the constitution.

The decision means only abortions due to incest, rape or a risk to the mother’s health remain legal, setting predominantly Catholic Poland far apart from the European mainstream.

Demonstrators have blamed the nationalist government of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and the Roman Catholic Church which has close ties to the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party for the court verdict.

In a rare display of anger against the Church last Sunday, demonstrators in Warsaw, Poznan and Katowice disrupted church services and defaced church buildings.

“In light of plans being announced by organisers for further acts of aggression and profanation, the police will take decisive action. The goal of the police is to ensure public order and safety for all citizens,” the Interior Ministry said in a statement.

It was not clear which group or plans the ministry was referring to. A mass demonstration is planned in Warsaw on Friday.

On Wednesday, organisers called for a nationwide walk-out for women at work. Some employers, including schools, announced a day off to allow people to join the protests.

Chanting “hypocrites, fanatics”, thousands marched through central Warsaw, some carrying posters that read “Revolution is a woman” and “I’d rather stay home but I have a government to overthrow”.

“Vision of a Madman”

Similar protests were staged across Poland. In Jelenia Gora, a town of 84,000 in the southwest, hundreds of mostly young people met in front of a shopping mall, some blowing whistles or holding banners that said “My uterus hurts looking at you” or ”This is my country, not a vision of a madman.”

Most wore masks in line with coronavirus restrictions in Poland that require them to be worn in public. Poland registered a record for new infections on Wednesday above 18,000.

The government denies influencing the court but the ruling follows five years of PiS efforts to instil more conservative values in public life in close cooperation with the Catholic Church. It also comes after sweeping judiciary reforms the European Commission says have politicised courts and undermined democratic norms.

An opinion poll by Kantar for the liberal Gazeta Wyborcza daily showed public support for PiS dropping to 26% this week from 39% last month, and another poll showed more than 70% of Poles say they oppose the court’s ruling.

Kamila Kobrynska, 35, who runs a professional training school for adults in Warsaw, joined businesses across Poland in closing up shop on Wednesday.

“We won’t go bankrupt in one day. This issue is so important, there is no discussion whether we work or protest.”

Supporters of the government were eager for the decision to be implemented. An anti-abortion campaign group, Ordo Iuris, called for its inclusion in the official gazette so that it goes into effect.

“We believe that every day of delay is a day that we lose another child’s life because of suspected flaws or genetic diseases,” said director Karolina Pawlowska.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5t6anh/article32966764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POLANDABORTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/police-warn-of-tougher-action-as-thousands-join-abortion-protests-in-poland/article32966765.ece
43,2020/10/29,U.S. rejection plunges WTO leadership into uncertainty,"Their decision, which awaits approval from WTO members, caps a more than four-month selection process involving intensive lobbying which saw her square up against South Korean trade minister Yoo Myung-hee in the final round.

The World Trade Organization’s bid to select a new leader was plunged into uncertainty on Wednesday after the United States rejected the Nigerian woman proposed as the global watchdog’s next director-general.

Three WTO ambassadors, charged with finding a successor to Brazilian Roberto Azevedo, had decided that Nigerian former finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala should be the next chief as she had secured wide cross-regional backing. The news confirmed what trade sources earlier told Reuters.

Their decision, which awaits approval from WTO members, caps a more than four-month selection process involving intensive lobbying which saw her square up against South Korean trade minister Yoo Myung-hee in the final round.

The head of the “troika” of ambassadors relayed their recommendation to WTO members at a meeting on Wednesday.

However, the United States then said they did not back Okonjo-Iweala. The decision needs to be approved by consensus, meaning any WTO member could block her appointment.

“One delegation could not support the candidacy of Dr. Ngozi and said they would continue to support South Korean minister Yoo. That delegation was the United States of America,” WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell told reporters at the WTO’s headquarters in Geneva after the closed-door meeting.

The WTO has set a meeting to settle the matter for Nov. 9, less than a week after U.S. voters go to the polls for a presidential election. It was not immediately clear if the outcome of the vote would affect the U.S. position on Okonjo-Iweala’s appointment.

Rockwell said there was likely to be “frenzied activity” before the Nov. 9 meeting to secure the required consensus.

Many members such as China and the United States had declined to name their preference publicly although some African, Caribbean and other states had voiced support for Okonjo-Iweala.

The European Union endorsed Okonjo-Iweala on Oct. 26.

However, three sources following the contest said that Washington had privately indicated a preference for Yoo.

The leadership void was created after outgoing WTO chief Azevedo stepped down a year early in August. The WTO is currently being steered by four deputies.

Okonjo-Iweala, a 66-year-old former finance minister and World Bank managing director, would face considerable challenges with rival economies bickering amid rising tensions and protectionism during a coronavirus-induced trade plunge.

Her inbox would also feature an overhaul of the WTO’s top appeals body - which U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has brought to its knees by blocking judge appointments - and a major trade conference in 2021.

Okonjo-Iweala, a development expert, has branded herself a ”do-er”, saying she has the political clout to command influence in capitals.

“I feel I can solve the problems. I’m a known reformer, not someone who talks about it. I’ve actually done it both at the World Bank and in my country,” she told Reuters.

Currently chair of the of GAVI vaccine alliance board, Okonjo-Iweala has also said the WTO should play a role in helping poorer countries access COVID-19 drugs and vaccines.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rd120d/article32966595.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NGOZIOKONJO-IWEALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-rejection-plunges-wto-leadership-into-uncertainty/article32966596.ece
44,2020/10/29,"Spain doubts Gibraltar border deal possible without Brexit deal, source says","A source said any deal aimed at creating a “shared prosperity zone” in Gibraltar, a British territory over which Spain claims sovereignty, was unlikely before a full Brexit agreement.

Spain and Gibraltar want to reach a side deal with Britain to avoid having a hard EU border in southern Spain after Brexit, but have stumbled on “a lack of political will” in London, a Spanish diplomatic source said.

The source said any deal aimed at creating a “shared prosperity zone” in Gibraltar, a British territory over which Spain claims sovereignty, was unlikely before a full Brexit agreement.

That broader deal remains uncertain just two months before Britain's post-Brexit transition period ends.

“We've made our suggestions, explored technical solutions on how to get there. What is lacking is the political will to close the deal. The ball is in the United Kingdom's court,” the source said on Wednesday.

Failure to reach a side deal on Gibraltar would carry a heavy social, economic and political cost, the source said.

Britain's foreign office said it was committed to finding a solution to support Gibraltar.

“The UK and Government of Gibraltar have held a number of constructive discussions with Spain on this issue,” a spokeswoman said. “It is clearly in all parties interests to find a solution, to ensure ongoing well-being and prosperity in the region.

Gibraltar has welcomed Spain's “pragmatism” on its key demand that their mutual border remains fully open, and the source expressed hope that this spirit would ultimately prevail.

About 15,000 people commute daily from Spain to Gibraltar, which has a population of 32,000.

The port at the northern tip of the Mediterranean, which Spain ceded to Britain in 1713 after a war, also welcomes some 10 million tourists per year, a sector accounting for about a quarter of its economy.

Spain has agreed to put the issue of its sovereignty claim to one side to focus on the opportunity to keep the border with Gibraltar open.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4jvidx/article32966535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EU-BRITAINGIBRALTAR-SPAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/spain-doubts-gibraltar-border-deal-possible-without-brexit-deal-source-says/article32966536.ece
45,2020/10/29,Chennai law student’s website simplifies law for the layperson,"Aswini Ramesh’s website 'lawrewired.in' was launched in August

When the lockdown started, Aswini Ramesh, a final-year student at the School of Excellence in Law, Taramani, noticed that a lot of people were looking up information pertaining to law, online.

“There was an increase in demand for details on family and property law, will or testament, and on court proceedings,” says the 22-year-old, over phone from Chennai. She then realised that there are very few reliable resources on law online.

Which is why she decided to launch lawrewired.in, a website that aims at simplifying legal concepts. “The idea is to make people aware of their duties and remedies, so that they do not suffer at a later point in time,” says Aswini.

“Once, a well-educated person who held a position of authority, asked me about divorce alimony; another wanted information on a joint will since their grandfather was unwell; a friend’s brother, who was the family’s sole breadwinner, passed away in an accident and they had no idea about third party insurance claim,” she says.

The constant queries from people around her made her realise that “there was a gap between Indian laws and common people,” and that “there was an urgent need for familiarising and demystifying legal concepts.”

The website, launched this August, has 22 law students behind it, with a core team of four, all of whom worked from home during the lockdown to build it.

“The research is guided by an advisory board that consists of seven people that includes academicians and lawyers,” she says, adding: “We are not-for-profit, and do not have plans to monetise our initiative for now.”

Aswini points out that her team has kept the language on the website simple, so that people from all walks of life can understand law as well as their rights. “There are anecdotes at the beginning of every section so that people can relate to the points discussed. We give examples, and finally, a summary with four to five points that sums it all up,” she says. She hopes that her portal empowers people. “When, as a victim, I have nowhere to go, I need to know what I can avail to save myself.”

48,2020/10/29,Centre relaxes Air India sale terms yet again,"Allows private players to quote EV

The Centre on Thursday revised bidding parameters for 100% stake sale in Air India, allowing private players to quote an enterprise value (EV) for the airline.

Before taking the decision, the government also contemplated on shutting down the airline due to failure in attracting buyers for the disinvestment process, which was first undertaken in 2018.

This is the government’s third effort to woo buyers. After tasting defeat in 2018, in January this year, the government floated a second proposal to sell the airline, offering to exit the airline completely and waive nearly half the debt — ₹29,000 crore of the total ₹60,000 crore debt. It had offered its entire stake in Air India, its low-cost international arm Air India Express, and ground handling arm AISATS.

“There has been a total change in the aviation environment and a large number of airlines are struggling,” Secretary of Ministry of Civil Aviation P.S. Kharola said at a press conference.

“The way we had packaged the Air India sale, we felt players may not evince interest,” he added.

Bidders will be given seven days to pose queries on the new bidding parameters after which they can submit their bids by November 14. The government will announce the qualified bidder by December 28, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Puri said.

This is the sixth time since January that the government has extended the deadline due to lack of interest from prospective buyers.

“Enterprise value shall mean combined value of debt and equity of AI as assessed by bidder in its financial bid,” DIPAM Secretary, Tuhin K. Pandey said.

“The only change is that there is no pre-determined debt. This doesn’t mean that Air India sale will be debt-free, but that the debt will be determined in the market,” Mr. Pandey said.

“The change is because of uncertainty in the market. Enterprise value will be discovered in the market through the bidding process. We are unshackling the process,” he added. He said that this process would not change the valuation of the airline.

Officials said that with the passage of time and due to COVID-19, Air India’s losses have increase and fixing the debt at any level would reduce the universe of bidders. Various inter-ministerial consultations also discussed the option of shutting down the airline permanently because of mounting losses and lack of interest from private players. “Retaining the airline is equally costly as it has been accruing losses of ₹500 crore per month, and shutting it down will cost ₹40,000 crore.”

To a question on what checks and balances the government would exercise to ensure the airline was not grossly undervalued, a senior government official said that there would be a reserve price that would be announced after the bids had been submitted and before they were opened.

The selected bidder will have to submit cash amount of 15% of enterprise value, and have the remaining share of debt transferred to its name.

Since March 31, Air India has accumulated a debt of ₹8,000 crore over and above its earlier debt of ₹60,000 crore.

Fare bands extended

The government has extended the mandatory fare bands airlines can levy on a specific route, until February 24.

The fare bands, which include a pre determined minimum and maximum fare airlines can charge, were first introduced from May 25 after the government allowed airlines to resume domestic flights.

Most airlines, barring a few that are cash-starved, have opposed the move on the ground that it prohibits them from stimulating demand. During a festive season this is likely to be a further setback.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/umzihn/article32637391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AirIndiaExpress,https://www.thehindu.com/business/centre-relaxes-air-india-sale-terms-yet-again/article32976196.ece
49,2020/10/29,RBI to issue fresh CDS norms soon: Bajaj,"‘Hedging instrument crucial for boosting bond investments in infrastructure’

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will soon issue fresh guidelines on credit default swaps (CDS), a financial derivative instrument to hedge risks in bond investments, a senior Finance Ministry official said on Thursday.

The development of CDS is considered critical for deepening India’s bond markets and the government believes that the enactment of the Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts law this month should pave the way for an active CDS market.

Talks with regulators

“The government is working with financial sector regulators, SEBI, RBI, IRDA and PFRDA to build a robust and vibrant bond market,” said Anand Bajaj, Additional Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs.

“The traded volumes in our bond markets in 2019-20 were not much at ₹19-₹20 lakh crore, while 98% of debt issuances were made through private placements,” Mr. Bajaj added. Stressing that fair valuation of bonds is a challenge when trading is limited, he said that to facilitate the development of the CDS market, the central bank would issue revised guidelines soon and more steps are in the offing to boost the bond market, especially as it would play a key role in funding infrastructure.

“We think that enhancing the bond markets is very important for the requirement of infrastructure financing, particularly the projects lined up in the National Infrastructure Pipeline,” he said at an Assocham event.

NFBCs cautioned

Earlier in the day, Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian also made a pitch for CDS to make India’s financial markets more vibrant, while urging non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to lend cautiously and enhance their risk assessment systems.

“Forbearance is necessary in today’s context, but zombie lending could come back to bite later,” he said, adding that the impact of such lending by NBFCs after 2008-09 should serve as a reminder of how it could affect the economy.

“After the 2008-09 global financial crisis, lending to firms with an interest coverage ratio of below one, had gone up significantly,” he said at a conference organised by FICCI.

“NBFCs face rollover and interconnected risks such as liquid debt mutual funds investing in papers issued by NBFCs. Every NBFC should monitor these risks even as the regulators are doing this,” said Mr. Subramanian.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/w7an78/article32976144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THBURBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbi-to-issue-fresh-cds-norms-soon-bajaj/article32976145.ece
50,2020/10/29,"Pidilite in ₹2,100-cr. deal to buy HAMSPL","Pidilite Industries Ltd. has entered into a definitive agreement with the U.S. based Huntsman Group to acquire 100% stake in one of its subsidiaries in India namely, Huntsman Advanced Materials Solutions Private Ltd. (HAMSPL). The company’s board on Wednesday approved the deal. The deal is for a cash consideration of approximately ₹2,100 crore, as per Pidilite.

HAMSPL manufactures and sells adhesives, sealants and other products under well-known brands such as Araldite, Araldite Karpenter and Araseal in India.

In the calendar year 2019, the company had business revenue of ₹400 crore.

In addition to the Indian Sub-Continent business, the acquisition includes a trademark licence for Middle East, Africa and ASEAN countries, Pidilite said in a statement.

Under the terms of the agreement, Huntsman will receive approximately 90% of the cash consideration at closing and balance approximately 10% under an earnout within 18 months if the business achieves sales revenue in-line with 2019.

The transaction is expected to close by next week.

HAMSPL has a nation-wide distribution network and a strong presence across India.

Apurva Parekh, ED, Pidilite Industries said, “Araldite is an iconic brand and a market leader in Epoxy Adhesives in India. Our association [with Huntsman] will remain strong going forward as well.”

Bharat Puri, MD, Pidilite Industries said, “With this acquisition, Araldite will add to the already very strong portfolio of Pidilite’s adhesive and sealant brands and will complement our retail portfolio.”

51,2020/10/29,Maruti Q2 net inches up as sales rise almost 10%,"No need for any tax cut now: Bhargava

Maruti Suzuki on Thursday reported second-quarter profit inched up 1% ₹1,371.6 crore, helped by a near 10% increase in sales. Pointing to the improvement in sales, Chairman R.C. Bhargava asserted there was no immediate need for a reduction in tax rates for the auto sector. He also said he expected steady demand for vehicles at least till December.

However, he cautioned that any drop in urban income levels on account of the economic slowdown could impact demand.

“Compared with the second quarter of last year, Maruti has performed better because last year was the time when Maruti went down 16%, the industry went down 18% [in volumes]. If you take that as the base, then doing better than that is something which is quite unsurprising,” Mr. Bhargava said.

The country’s largest carmaker reported net sales increased 9.7% year-on-year in the July-September quarter to ₹17,689.3 crore. The company sold a total of 3,93,130 vehicles during the quarter, up 16.2% compared to the same period previous year.

To a query on a reduction in the Goods and Services Tax, he said that currently there wasn’t any lack of demand for cars and giving relief at this stage would be quite unnecessary. “Today, I’m selling everything I can produce. If the GST went down and demand increased by another 30%, I wouldn’t have cars to sell,” he said.

Mr. Bhargava added that the auto industry had done pretty well in the second quarter and no one had suffered because of lack of demand.

He, however, stressed, “In case demand actually falls off and it looks like that it’s not a temporary event but a sustained kind of falling off...that is when the government will need to consider what they need to do.”

He also said he didn’t see any demand slump till at least December.

“After that, the situation is hard to predict because the impact of the festival will be over. To a large extent, the impact of people wanting personal vehicles will be over. We don’t know what the urban income level will be and how much purchasing power will be left with the people in urban areas because the economic downturn is there. I don’t see that there can be any strong kind of urban demand coming. And not because people don’t want the car, but because they can’t afford the cars.”

He, however, added that given that monsoons and previous crops had been good, rural areas —which even today were contributing significantly to the growth of sales — sales would continue to grow substantially.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/tzbb6k/article32976088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THBUBHARGAVA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/maruti-q2-net-inches-up-as-sales-rise-almost-10/article32976089.ece

Demand for gold in India declined 30% to 86.6 tonnes in the July-September quarter as compared with 123.9 tonnes a year earlier due to COVID-19 disruptions and record high prices, data released by the World Gold Council showed.

Total jewellery demand during the quarter decreased by 48% to 52.8 tonnes. In terms of value, jewellery demand fell 29% to ₹24,100 crore from the year-earlier period. However, the demand for gold coins, bars and ETF had seen a surge. “Total investment demand increased 52% to 33.8 tonnes during the quarter,” Somasundaram PR, MD India, World Gold Council said. In terms of value, gold investment demand was ₹15,410 crore.

During the quarter, global gold demand dropped by 19% year-on-year to 892 tonnes as consumers continued to feel the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“This was the lowest quarterly total since Q3 2009. The year-to-date demand of 2,972 It was 10% lower vs the same period in 2019,” WGC said in its latest gold demand trend report.

While overall demand declined, the quarter saw significant growth in investment demand which rose by 21% y-o-y. Investors globally bought 222.1 tonnes of gold bars and coins and an additional 272.5 tonnes through gold-backed ETFs.

Year-to-date, gold ETFs have increased their holdings by a record 1,003.3 tonnes.

However, the combination of continued social distancing restrictions in many markets, the economic slowdown, and a record high gold price in many currencies, proved too much for many jewellery buyers.

For the September 2020 quarter, Cognizant’s revenue was almost flat at $4.2 billion, including a negative 130 basis points impact from the exit of certain content services, Cognizant said in a statement.

Cognizant — which has about 2 lakh employees based in India — follows January-December as financial year.

“Against a challenging demand environment, we continued to strengthen our portfolio, execute our digital strategy and increase our competitiveness,” Cognizant Chief Executive Officer Brian Humphries said.

Clients are realising they can distinguish themselves if they embrace disruption and transform, and the company is committed to making that easy for them, he added.

Cognizant’s headcount stood at 2,83,100 at the end of the September 2020 quarter.

The company said its year-to-date bookings increased 15%, and since the beginning of the third quarter till October 27 it has returned to shareholders over $700 million through share repurchases and $120 million in dividends.

“FY2020 revenue is expected to be at the high end of the previously guided range at approximately $ 16.7 billion, or a decline of 0.4% in constant currency,” the company said.

In FY2019, the company had posted a revenue of $16.8 billion.

“Our cost discipline and strong year-to-date cash flow enabled continued investments in growth initiatives. We took further actions to increase our financial flexibility in support of our strategic priorities,” the firm’s Chief Financial Officer Jan Siegmund said.

Since the beginning of the third quarter, Cognizant has returned over $800 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, Siegmund added.

In terms of verticals, Cognizant saw its financial services (34.6% of topline) revenue decline 1.5% year-on-year, driven by declines in both banking and insurance.

Growth in regional banks and capital markets in North America was offset by weakness in select global banking accounts and in Europe, Cognizant said.

Revenue of healthcare, which accounts for 29% of the total revenues, grew 4.8% year-on-year, driven by life sciences.

Growth in bio pharmaceutical clients and revenue from acquisition of Zenith Technologies offset weakness in medical device clients, it said.

Products and resources revenue was down 4% year-on-year. The decline was driven by retail, consumer goods, travel and hospitality clients that were particularly adversely affected by the pandemic, partially offset by double-digit constant currency growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities, Cognizant said.

Products and resources accounted for 21.9% of the total revenue.

Communications, media and technology increased 0.2% year-on-year and contributed 14.5% of the total revenue.

The company said the communication and media vertical grew 0.2% year-on-year.

“Growth within our communications and media clients was more than offset by a negative 920 basis point impact from our 2019 strategic decision to exit certain content related services,” Cognizant said.

Excluding that impact, communications, media and technology grew approximately 9% in constant currency.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/oaeb5j/article32970771.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COGNIZANTSIPCOTSEZTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cognizant-q3-income-down-30-to-348-million/article32970772.ece
61,2020/10/29,Tupperware’s profit spikes amid the pandemic,"Restaurant pain has turned into Tupperware’s gain with millions of people in a pandemic opening cookbooks again and looking for solutions to leftovers.

Tupperware relied on social gatherings for explosive growth in the mid 20th century. In the 21st century, it is social distancing that is fuelling sales.

Restaurant pain has turned into Tupperware’s gain with millions of people in a pandemic opening cookbooks again and looking for solutions to leftovers.

They’ve found, again, it in Tupperware, suddenly an “it brand” five decades after what seemed to be its glory days.

The company had appeared to be on life support, posting negative sales growth in five of the last six years, a trend that seemed to be accelerating this year.

Then the pandemic struck. Profit during the most recent quarter quadrupled to $34.4 million, Tupperware reported on Wednesday.

The explosion of sales caught almost everyone off guard and shares of Tupperware Brands Corp., which had been rising since April, spiked 40$ to a new high for the year. Shares that could be had for around $1 in March, closed in on $30 Wednesday.

Tupperware stands apart from most other companies that have thrived in the pandemic. Unlike Netflix, Amazon.com, Peloton or even DraftKings, it doesn’t rely on a hi-tech platform.

However, it’s certainly not alone as the pandemic bends how we spend our time more rapidly perhaps than any point in our lifetimes.

On Monday the toymaker Hasbro said that its games division, which includes board games like Monopoly, saw a 21% jump in revenue.

On Wednesday, Tupperware reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share, triple what Wall Street had expected. Revenue of $477.2 million was about 30% higher than forecasts and 14% better than last year.

CEO Miguel Fernandez said the company, based in Orlando, Florida, had shifted more heavily to digital sales to accommodate those sheltering in the pandemic. He also noted “increased consumer demand.”

The company earlier this year had begun a turnaround campaign. Mr. Fernandez, who once led Avon, was named CEO in March just as COVID-19 infections began to spread in the U.S.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/tupperwares-profit-spikes-amid-the-pandemic/article32970207.ece

India on Thursday described the map of Kashmir in a new currency note of Saudi Arabia as a “gross misrepresentation” of sovereign territory. Official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said during the weekly briefing that Delhi has taken up the issue at the diplomatic level with Riyadh.

“We have conveyed our serious concern to Saudi Arabia, both through their Ambassador in New Delhi as well as in Riyadh, for this gross misrepresentation of India’s external territorial boundaries on an official and legal banknote of Saudi Arabia and asked the Saudi side for taking urgent corrective steps in this regard,” said Mr. Srivastava asserting that “the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are integral parts of India”.

The 20 riyal note was printed by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority on October 24 to celebrate the Saudi presidency of the G20. The global outfit for international cooperation will convene its next summit meeting on November 21-22 in virtual mode and the controversy has cast a shadow on the preparatory days for the summit.

65,2020/10/29,"Amid Shringla’s visit, India flays knife attacks in Nice","There is no justification for terrorism, says Ministry

Foreign Secretary Harshvardhan Shringla arrived in Paris on Thursday, just hours after another deadly suspected terror attack in France, in which three people were killed by a knife-wielding attacker inside a church in Nice.

Also read: Three dead as woman beheaded in knife attack at French church

The attack was condemned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who expressed solidarity with the French people.

“Our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and the people of France. India stands with France in the fight against terrorism,” Mr. Modi tweeted.

Ahead of the visit, the External Affairs Ministry had condemned a similar beheading of a school teacher in a Parisian suburb last week, and backed French President Emmanuelle Macron against “personal attacks in unacceptable language” made by Turkey and Pakistan.

“We believe there is no justification for terrorism,” External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said on Thursday, when asked about the latest attack.

Also read: India deplores personal attacks on French President

During his visit, Mr. Shringla, who is due to travel to Germany and the United Kingdom next as part of the week-long three-nation tour, is also expected to focus on strategic partnership, cooperating on the Indo-Pacific, and dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.

“The in-person consultations with European interlocutors are another step in India’s pandemic-age diplomacy,” Mr. Shringla tweeted.

The MEA said several aspects of dealing with COVID-19, including cooperation in the development of a vaccine, diagnostics and testing, procuring medical equipment and ensuring safe treatment, as well as dealing with the post-Covid impact on the economy are on the agenda for talks.

Boosting supply

In particular, the MEA spokesperson said talks would include “enhancing supply chain resilience”, indicating that concerns over an over-dependence on Chinese manufacturing over the past few months, which has been shared in Europe, would also come up.

“This is part of our continuing outreach despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We share democratic values with them, they are our strategic partners. We have multidimensional relations with them,” Mr. Srivastava said, referring to the three-nation visit, adding that the Foreign Secretary would discuss India’s “commitment to a free open and inclusive Indo Pacific”, as well.

Mr. Shringla’s travels follow the Indo-U.S. 2+2 consultations in Delhi this week, where U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also highlighted the need for countries to cooperate on the Indo-Pacific where he said the Chinese ruling party “CCP is no friend to democracy, the rule of law, transparency, the freedom of navigation [which is] the foundation of a free and prosperous Indo-Pacific.”

The visit by Mr. Shringla is a push for “proactive diplomacy” by the MEA, after months of virtual meetings. Mr. Shringla, who is expected to travel to the neighbourhood including the Maldives in November, has travelled only to Bangladesh and Myanmar during the past few months. During his stops in Paris, Berlin and London, the Foreign Secretary is expected to interact with business chambers, academics and media.

“This was an Indian initiative, and we are delighted to host the Indian Foreign Secretary at a time when it is complicated for us to meet in other situations,” a European diplomat said, referring to the fact that many other high level meetings and summits are still being held in the virtual format due to the pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/1rz4nv/article32973897.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Nice-attack,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amid-shringlas-visit-india-flays-knife-attacks-in-nice/article32975825.ece

“The Ministry has taken the lapses made in providing information on Arogya Setu app very strictly. We have issued directions to initiate suitable action against the officers responsible for this,” an IT Ministry official, who did not want to be named, said.

The official added that the Ministry has also directed the National Informatics Centre (NIC) and National E-Governance Division (NeGD) to take suitable action against the officers dealing with the RTI query.

“We are committed to furnish all the information sought under the RTI Act to the applicant and comply with the directions of the Central Information Commission (CIC),” the official said.

The CIC termed the response as “preposterous” and issued a show cause notice to the NIC to explain why a penalty under the RTI Act not be slapped on it for “prima facie obstruction of information and providing an evasive reply”.

Following this, the Ministry had clarified that the Aarogya Setu application has been developed by National Informatics Centre (NIC) in collaboration with volunteers from industry and academia.

67,2020/10/29,Centre sets up permanent Commission to tackle air pollution in Delhi territory,"22-year-old Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority dissolved

Dissolving the 22-year-old Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) that has so far addressed air pollution in Delhi, the Centre has constituted a “permanent” body — the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas.

Encompassing Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the all-powerful body assumes several powers to coordinate action among States, levy fines — ranging up to ₹1 crore or five years of prison — to address air pollution. Brought in via an ordinance on Thursday, it awaits formal perusal by the Supreme Court before it can be brought into effect.

Also read: Delhi’s AQI inches close to ‘very poor’ category

There will be at least six permanent members and it will be headed by a former or incumbent Secretary to the Government of India, or a Chief Secretary to a State government. It has members from several Ministries as well as representatives from the States.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and its State branches have the powers to implement provisions of the Environment Protection Act for air, water and land pollution. Their powers continue. However, in case of dispute or a clash of jurisdictions, the Commission’s writ will prevail specific to matters concerning air pollution.

Also read: Only 4% pollution in Delhi-NCR due to stubble burning, says Prakash Javadekar

A major weakness, environmentalists and experts have said, in tackling air pollution in Delhi and the surrounding region, has been the inability of agencies such as the CPCB and the EPCA to consistently enforce rules on the ground. Rules to, for instance, factor in stubble burning or prevent pollution from thermal plants do exist, but these are often not strongly enforced always in States due to political considerations.

A senior official in the government said the new Commission would be empowered to constitute special investigative groups for stricter implementation but the letter of the ordinance has no detail on the creation of new cadre or groups tasked with implementation.

Also read: Air quality of NCR cities Delhi, Gurugram and Noida worsens to ‘very poor’ category

“The major issue with the ordinance will be when it comes to implementation, as EPCA had almost similar powers but failed miserably in cleaning the air even after being in force for more than 20 years. The question of whether it’s a positive move or just a distraction and wasteful exercise will be decided on the fact whether the ordinance changes the status quo when it comes to ground implementation and strict action on polluters or not,” said Sunil Dahiya, Analyst, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

EPCA Chairman Bhure Lal, and Member Sunita Narain said in a letter to the Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday that they “welcomed” the creation of a new Commission. They also listed key contributions of the EPCA — the notification of the Graded Response Action Plan that lists out measures to be taken in case of worsening pollution, the construction of the Regional Rapid Transport System and early adoption of BS-VI fuel standards, among other measures.

“In the ultimate analysis, the effectiveness of the Commission will be determined by the choice of its permanent members, especially its Chairperson,” said Ajay Mathur, Director-General, The Energy Resources Institute. “We need to ensure that these members have the capability to bind together the States into air quality solutions that can and will solve our air quality problems.”

Describing the Commission as a “bureaucratic vessel”, Navroz Dubash of the Centre for Policy Research said in a statement: “The fact that it was created practically overnight, with no discussion and input, does not inspire confidence that it will open the doors to a more fruitful conversation and action across all interests...The Commission is a lost opportunity to explicitly set the ground rules for an air-shed based approach — one that could have been deployed in polluted areas across the country.”

Others rued the lack of diversity in representation. “Of the 15 members, only three members representing NGOs have been included. The Commission has been given power to co-opt members, but the majority are Ministries which are engaged in actions which contribute towards pollution — the Ministry of Power, Housing and Urban Affairs; Road Transport and Highways; Petroleum and Natural Gas. The only exception is the Ministry of Agriculture. Crucial Ministries missing are the Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ministry of Labour,” said environmental lawyer Ritwick Datta in a statement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5hmi2r/article32975396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DELHIPOLLUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-sets-up-permanent-commission-to-tackle-air-pollution-in-delhi-territory/article32975397.ece
68,2020/10/29,Yashvardhan Kumar Sinha to be next Chief Information Commissioner,"Shortlisting and selection did not follow Supreme Court guidelines: Congress leader’s dissent note.

Former diplomat and Central Information Commissioner Yashvardhan Kumar Sinha is tipped to be appointed as the country’s next Chief Information Commissioner (CIC), two months after the position at the top transparency watchdog fell vacant, sources said on Thursday.

The decision was taken after an October 24 meeting of the high-powered selection panel headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, Congress Leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is also a member of the panel, is learnt to have submitted a dissent note.

Also read | Govt denies info on Chief Information Commissioner applicants

The Opposition leader objected to the manner in which the shortlisting process was carried out, alleging a failure to follow the Supreme Court’s transparency guidelines, issued in a February 2019 case brought by RTI (Right to Information) activist Anjali Bhardwaj. Mr. Chowdhury also objected to the fact that journalist Uday Mahurkar had been shortlisted for a Commissioner position although he had not been on the list of applicants.

Mr. Sinha is a retired officer of the Indian Foreign Service and has previously served as India’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and to Sri Lanka. He was appointed as a member of the Central Information Commission in January 2019.

The Commission is the highest appellate authority under the Right to Information Act, and consists of a Chief and up to ten Commissioners. It has been headless twice this year, due to a two month delay in appointing the last chief Bimal Julka, and another two month period since he retired at the end of August. It has not functioned at full strength for almost four years, and currently has only five Commissioners, leading to a backlog of almost 37,000 pending cases.

When the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) issued advertisements for the vacancies in July, it received 139 applications for the CIC position and 355 applications for the Information Commissioner vacancies. The procedure is for a search committee to then shortlist the applicants for the selection panel’s consideration.

The three-member selection committee including the PM, Mr. Chowdhury and Home Minister Amit Shah met twice, on October 7 and 24. DoPT Minister of State Jitendra Singh was also present, according to sources. They considered Mr. Sinha and his fellow Commissioner and former Secretary to the Finance Ministry, Neeraj Kumar Gupta, for the CIC position.

They also considered seven shortlisted candidates for the remaining Commission vacancies, including senior journalist Uday Mahurkar, who authored a book on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s governance model in 2017. According to sources, he was not on the list of 355 applicants, and was apparently included in the shortlist to satisfy the Supreme Court’s directive to consider a broad field of expertise and look beyond the stable of Civil Services veterans.

According to sources, the other shortlisted candidates are all from a bureaucratic background, including former Defence Production Secretary Subhash Chandra, former Labour Secretary Heeralal Samariya, former MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) Secretary Arun Kumar Panda, retired All India Radio News Director General Ira Joshi, Deputy Comptroller and Auditor General (DCAG) Meenakshi Gupta and former DCAG Saroj Punhani. It is not known how many vacancies are being filled at this time.

In a February 2019 order, the apex court ruled that such long delays in clearing appeals frustrated citizens’ rights and directed that appointments be made in a “transparent and timely” manner. The government was directed to put up “all necessary information” on their website, including particulars of the applicants and the composition of the search committee which shortlists candidates. “It would also be appropriate for the Search Committee to make the criteria for shortlisting the candidates, public, so that it is ensured that shortlisting is done on the basis of objective and rational criteria,” it added.

However, the DoPT has refused to make this information public. In a September response to an RTI request from Ms. Bhardwaj, it argued that information relating to particulars of applicants is exempted under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act, 2005, which aims to protect individual privacy unless the larger public interest is involved.

The DoPT also refused to release information on the search committee’s composition, meetings or criteria. “As the process of selection is yet to be completed, it would not be conducive to furnish such information in the manner it is sought. No such practice is followed in any other equivalent high level appointments of Government,” it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/p24vak/article32975933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YKSinhajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yashvardhan-kumar-sinha-to-be-next-chief-information-commissioner/article32975039.ece
69,2020/10/29,"Court orders inquiry against Kangana, sister","The court ordered inquiry reported to be called in under section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure from the police station concerned.

The Andheri Magistrate court on Thursday ordered an inquiry against actor Kangana Ranaut and her sister, Rangoli Chandel, in a complaint, which alleged they used hateful language against Muslims in social media to gain cheap publicity.

The complaint has been filed by advocate Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh, stating that on April 15, Ms. Chandel posted a defamatory and objectionable statement against ‘jamati’ from her Twitter account. Thereafter, her account was suspended. Ms. Ranaut supported her statement.

Short video

On April 18, Ms. Ranaut posted a short video on various social media platform accounts and called a section of Muslims (‘jamati’) as terrorist. Thus, both the accused posted hateful and derogatory statements against the community. They have misused the social media platforms to gain cheap publicity and personal gain.

The complaint is filed for offences punishable under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration), 298 (uttering words etc with deliberate intent to wound religious feelings), and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief), 195A (threatening any person to give false evidence), 298 (uttering, words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person) of the Indian Penal Code.

The court read the complaint and said, “allegations are based upon the comments of accused on social media. Evidence against accused is of electronic nature. Therefore, inquiry at the hands of police is necessary for proceeding against the accused. Such inquiry will be helpful to decide the roles of accused.”

70,2020/10/29,Permanent commission for women naval officers | Supreme Court gives time to government,"March 17 judgment upheld the right of women naval officers to be considered for PC on a par with their male counterparts.

The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the Union government time till December 31 to implement its March 17 judgment, which upheld the right of women naval officers to be considered for permanent commission (PC) on a par with their male counterparts.

The court had upheld the women officers’ right for a level-playing field in the Defence Services to overcome “histories of discrimination”.

SC verdict on permanent commission to women officers: A blow to stereotypical mindset, says lawyer

The court had said that women officers in the Short Service Commission (SSC), serving in the field of education, law and logistics cadres of the Navy, should be considered for the grant of permanent commission. It had originally given three months’ time to the Centre to complete the modalities.

Delay in implementation

However, in August, the women officers returned to the court complaining about the delay in the implementation of the judgment.

On Thursday, a Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud agreed to extend the timeline after the government said it needed more time for preparations owing to the pandemic.

In the March judgment, the court said the “101 excuses” devised by the government to deter women from being on a par with men, including motherhood and physiological limitations, reeked of a stereotypical mindset.

“The battle for gender equality is about confronting the battles of the mind. In the context of the Armed Forces, specious reasons have been advanced by decision makers and administrators. They range from physiology, motherhood and physical attributes to the male dominated hierarchies,” Justice Chandrachud observed in a 64-page judgment in March.

This order was based on a case filed by 17 women SSC officers who were denied PC and discharged despite completing 14 years of service. They had challenged a February 26, 2008 policy letter of the government granting PC to SSC officers in all the three branches of the armed forces.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q3vv7/article32491742.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1TH-COURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/women-naval-officers-permanent-commission-supreme-court-gives-time-to-government/article32974636.ece

The Governor’s Rule in the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) is likely to be extended as the State government is yet to finalise the timetable for elections to its 28-member executive committee. An Administrator was appointed to the council after the term of the elected committee ended on May 17 last and a fresh election schedule could not be announced due to the pandemic.

The State government had notified the Governor’s Rule under the provisions of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution for six months. The arrangement lapses on November 16.

Officials on Thursday said no decision has yet been made on the timetable. They said a fresh notification would be issued in the first week of November to extend the Governor’s Rule.

Informed sources said the election schedule will depend on a political decision of ruling BJP. Though the BJP had earlier thought of contesting unaided, it is still considering an alliance with the Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT), its coalition partner in the State government.

Assam’s senior BJP leader and Chairman of the North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) Himanta Biswa Sarma is expected to visit the State early next month to discuss the option and combination. The TTAADC has limited authority over the State’s three fourth lands.

An IPFT delegation recently met BJP president J.P. Nadda in Delhi and sought to contest 22 seats. It argued that the party had agreed to fight in nine seats in the 2018 Assembly elections to give the BJP an edge under an assurance that it would be given majority share in the TTAADC.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/governors-rule-in-tripura-tribal-council-likely-to-be-extended/article32974621.ece
72,2020/10/29,"Mehbooba, Omar pledge to fight against move to allow outsiders to buy land in J&K","Authorities disallow PDP march in Srinagar, arrest scores of its leaders and activists

Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti and National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah on Thursday pledged to fight the Centre’s move to introduce new land laws in J&K and allow outsiders to buy land.

The authorities disallowed a street protest of the PDP in Srinagar over the issue.

“I am not going to sit idle and will fight the Centre’s open loot in J&K. They are stealing our resources. Allowing outsiders to buy land in J&K is just an election stunt. We will continue to raise our voice collectively and won’t tolerate attempts to change demographics,” Ms. Mufti said.

She said her party leaders were arrested in Srinagar when they tried to hold a peaceful protest “against the settler colonial land laws thrust upon people of J&K”.

“I am glad that the people of Jammu and Ladakh too have realised the essence of People’s Alliance for Gupkar declaration. I won’t allow this open loot. In other States, people have no food to eat but the BJP government wants them to buy land in J&K. Today, J&K has been converted into a big jail.”

She also questioned the Centre’s move to engage with Ladakh and not J&K on land laws and job protection.

“When people of Ladakh protested, they were taken to Delhi and asked about their opinion. Why don’t they allow anyone to talk here? Their intention is pure communal,” she alleged.

Earlier in the day, the authorities disallowed the march of the PDP in Srinagar and arrested scores of its leaders and activists. The PDP office was also sealed by the police to foil the march.

Addressing a party meeting in Srinagar, Mr. Abdullah also condemned the land laws.

“Nobody can buy land in Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh etc. but the rich section has been given open land to throw people of J&K out. They are expecting silence from us which is not possible. I don’t know how long this fight will continue but will fight it tooth and nail,” he said.

He said leaders in Nagaland have openly rejected the Constitution, flag and sovereignty. “Despite that, talks are being held with them. When people in J&K raise their voice for their identity, land and other rights, we are tagged as anti-nationals,” the former Chief Minister said.

He said the Centre was “criminalising dissent”. “The Centre was compelling the mainstream politicians of J&K to call it a day. “I am not counting seats as this fight is not for the power.

73,2020/10/29,PLA has further transgressed into Indian territory: Ladakh ex-MP,"Indian soldiers are living in tents in sub-zero conditions, claims former BJP Member of Parliament Thupstan Chhewang.

Chinese troops have further transgressed into Indian territory and occupied positions in Finger 2 and 3 of the north bank of Pangong Tso (lake), former BJP Member of Parliament Thupstan Chhewang, who represented Ladakh, has claimed .

Also read: Troops standing firm on LAC: Defence Minister Rajnath

Mr. Chhewang said he had received information from locals living in forward areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh that Indian soldiers were living in tents and it was not adequate for them in sub-zero conditions.

The stand-off

India and China have been engaged in a military stand-off in Eastern Ladakh for the past five months.

Mr. Chhewang told The Hindu, “The border situation is critical. The Chinese troops have not only further transgressed into our areas but they have also occupied prominent positions in Finger 2 and 3 areas of Pangong Tso, even Hot Springs area they have not fully vacated... this is what we have come to know from locals.”

As reported earlier by The Hindu, China has ingressed about 8 km in the Finger area and India not been able to patrol beyond Finger 4 since April last week, when China amassed troops in several pockets along the LAC. Earlier, Indian troops could patrol up to Finger 8. The other areas where a worrying build-up has been seen are the Depsang plains, Galwan, Gogra-Hot Springs and the south bank of Pangong Tso in Chushul where Indian troops are in a dominating position.

“The soldiers are put up in tents; this is not acceptable. If despite several negotiations, the government is not able to convince the Chinese to withdraw, then adequate shelter should be provided to the soldiers,” he said.

Meeting with Amit Shah

Mr. Chhewang led a delegation to Delhi in September when he met Home Minister Amit Shah to demand the Union Territory’s (UT) inclusion in the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution. He said the Centre assured them that any changes in land laws in Ladakh would be held in consultation with leaders.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) notified new land laws for the UT of Jammu and Kashmir allowing anyone from other parts of the country to purchase land there.

Mr. Chhewang said, “The gazette notification with regard to land in Jammu and Kashmir has created lot of confusion here in Ladakh. But we hope that the Home Ministry will not issue such a notification for the Ladakh UT, as Amit Shah ji has categorically given an assurance to the Ladakh delegation headed by veteran leaders to provide all necessary constitutional safeguard during the course of our discussion in Delhi. We are confident that the Home Ministry will accept our demand for including UT of Ladakh under Sixth Schedule.”

The Sixth Schedule protects tribal populations and provides autonomy to the communities through the creation of autonomous development councils that can frame laws on land, public health, agriculture etc. As of now, 10 autonomous councils exist in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.

Two months ago, People’s Movement, a group comprising all political parties and the influential Buddhist association, was formed in Ladakh to strongly demand the inclusion in the Sixth Schedule and seek protection from outsiders.

The group had decided to boycott the recently concluded autonomous council elections in Leh after the delegation was assured that “all issues related to language, demography, ethnicity, land and jobs will be considered positively/ taken care of.”

Mr. Chhewang said, “The BJP was able to get only a simple majority in the elections, we have a strong Opposition now. They should empower the nationalist forces. We are yet to get a call from the Centre for the proposed meeting”.

The MHA said in a statement on September 27 that a “dialogue between a larger Ladakhi delegation comprising representatives from Leh and Kargil districts under the aegis of the People’s Movement for constitutional safeguard under the Sixth Schedule and the Home Ministry would commence after 15 days of the culmination of LAHDC [Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council], Leh elections. Any decision so reached in this connection would be in consultation with the representatives from Leh and Kargil.”

74,2020/10/29,Government changes land-use of 15 acre plot to make way for V-P’s residence,"Master Plan and Zonal Plan modified ‘after carefully considering all aspects of the matter.’

The Centre this week approved the change in land-use of a 15 acre plot near Rashtrapati Bhavan for the construction of a new residential complex for the Vice-President as a part of the Central Vista redevelopment project.

Monumental hurry: On Central Vista project

The Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry on Wednesday notified the change in land-use of the plot on Church Road, near the Delhi Transport Corporation’s Central Secretariat Bus Terminal, from “transportation (bus terminal/parking) and government (President Estate and Parliament House)” to “residential” in the Master Plan for Delhi-2021. In the Zonal Development Plan, the land-use was changed from transportation and recreational (neighbourhood play area) to residential.

The plot is located with Church Road to its north, Rashtrapati Bhavan and North Block to its south, part of North Block to its east, and Rashtrapati Bhavan to its west.

The notification said a public notice was published on March 4 to seek objections and suggestions for a period of 30 days and 90 such submissions were received. It added that the Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) Board of Enquiry had considered the objections. It said the Central government had decided to modify the Master Plan and Zonal Plan “after carefully considering all aspects of the matter”.

While the notification does not mention what the plot will be used for, sources involved with the Central Vista project, which includes the construction of a new Parliament building, Prime Minister’s residence and 10 new office buildings for Ministries, said it will house the Vice-President’s Enclave.

In March this year, the Centre had approved the change in land-use for plots for the new Parliament, Prime Minister’s residence and government offices. The DDA had published a public notice on December 21, 2019 seeking comments for the proposed land-use change of the plots, which included the 15 acre plot on Church Road. However, the proposal at that time was to change the land-use to “government office” and it was not approved with the other plots in March.

In its March 4 public notice, the DDA said the Ministry’s Land and Development Office had on January 1 asked for the proposal to be modified to change the land-use to residential instead of government office.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/xssdu3/article32974015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-Central-vista-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/government-changes-land-use-of-15-acre-plot-to-make-way-for-v-ps-residence/article32974009.ece

Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan, on Thursday, reviewed the status of COVID-19 in the States/UT of West Bengal, Kerala and Delhi and their public health response measures. He advised these States/UTs to gear up “testing, tracking & treatment” strategy during the festival season and also asked them to ensure that additional thrust be given to public awareness as well as enforcement of COVID-appropriate behaviours.

The video conference saw the participation of V.K. Paul, member (Health), NITI Aayog, and Director General of ICMR Balram Bhargava, health secretaries from the States/UT among others.

A release issued by the Ministry said Delhi has 29,378 active cases as of Thursday with a fatality rate of 1.76% and a positivity rate of 7.9%.

“5,673 new cases were recorded in the last 24 hours and there has been nearly 46% increase in the new cases over the past four weeks, and the positivity rate over the past four weeks has escalated by nearly 9%. The rising cases were attributed by the Delhi team to social gatherings during the festivities, the deteriorating air quality, increasing incidences of respiratory disorders, and clusters of positive cases at work places,” said the Ministry.

It added that the UT was advised to aggressively ramp up testing, increase RT-PCR tests, focus on contact tracing and effectively enforce isolation of the traced contacts within the first 72 hours.

“Delhi has been advised to focus on containment zones, and strict perimeter control to be implemented as per MHA guidelines,” said the Ministry.

“Darjeeling, Nadia, Medinipur West, Jalpaiguri, Hooghly are the top districts showing increasing trend in cases.

76,2020/10/29,"Indo-U.S. 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue brought ‘unprecedented cooperation’ between two countries, say U.S. lawmakers","The U.S. will keep working with India to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific and will remain steadfast as India seeks to defend its sovereignty from external aggression, Congressman Michael T McCaul said.

Two eminent American lawmakers have welcomed the successful conclusion of the 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue between India and the U.S., saying that the deliberations brought “unprecedented cooperation” between the two countries.

During the third edition of the Indo-U.S. 2+2 Dialogue in New Delhi on Tuesday, the two countries vowed to ramp up their overall security ties and inked a total of five pacts, including the strategic Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) that will allow sharing of high-end military technology, classified satellite data and critical information.

The challenges of walking the Indo-Pacific talk

The other pacts will facilitate cooperation in areas of nuclear energy, earth sciences and Ayurveda.

The talks were led by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar from the Indian side and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark T Esper from the U.S. side.

The U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue has brought “unprecedented cooperation” between our two countries, pushing our Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership to new heights, said Congressman Michael T McCaul, Republican Leader of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

The achievements of the 2+2 Dialogue, including the BECA geo-spatial cooperation agreement, add to a successful month, during which our two nations deepened the Quad framework with Japan and Australia, and welcomed Australia into the quadrilateral maritime Exercise Malabar, he said.

Drive a harder bargain at the Delhi meet

In a significant move amid a Sino-India border row, India on October 19 announced Australia’s participation in the upcoming Malabar exercise along with the U.S. and Japan, effectively making it the first military-level engagement between the four-member nation grouping - the Quad.

The United States will keep working with India to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific and will remain steadfast as India seeks to defend its sovereignty from external aggression, Mr. McCaul said.

India, the U.S. and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open, and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China’s rising military maneuvering in the region.

In November 2017, India, Japan, the U.S. and Australia gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the “Quad” to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.

In the midst of growing global concern over China’s expansionist behaviour, the foreign ministers of the Quad member nations met in Tokyo on October 6 and reaffirmed their collective vision for a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.

The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The U.S. has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness.

Congressman Brad Sherman, in a tweet, welcomed the successful conclusion of the 2+2 Ministerial.

Great to see India & the U.S. conclude another successful 2+2 Ministerial to further expand the U.S.-India relationship, he said.

A large number of tests were being conducted every day with one crore tests conducted in the last nine days, the Ministry stated.

“Evidence has revealed that comprehensive and widespread testing on a sustained basis has resulted in bringing down the positivity rate.

The Enforcement Directorate has seized shares worth ₹1.19 crore, held by an accused in Sanatan Financers & Real Estates Private Limited, for holding two properties in the United Kingdom in alleged violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act.

The properties worth £1.26 lakh, located in the Stoke-on-Trent area of the U.K., were acquired by accused Sunil Kumar in alleged contravention of Section 4 of the Act.

The seizure order was issued on the basis of documents found during the searches in the official premises of the company in January, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

The money-laundering case has been instituted with respect to the FIRs registered by the Goa police alleging that the Sanatan Financers & Real Estates Private Limited, Sunil Kumar and his son Ankit had cheated foreign nationals.

It is alleged that from 2006 to 20011, the accused collected funds from the victims through the Foreign Direct Investment route on the pretext of selling to them flats and villas under project “Peace Valley” in Goa’s Sirvoi. However, the ownership was never transferred to them. The accounts of shell entities were used for receiving the money.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday wrote to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath about high electricity tariff being charged from the weavers of Varanasi and urged the State government to charge a “flat rate”.

Ms. Vadra also asked the U.P. government to ensure that weavers are not “harassed” in the name of collecting “fake” outstanding bills and urged that power supply be restored for all weavers who were unable to pay their bills.

The letter follows Ms. Vadra’s meeting with a group of around 50 weavers from Varanasi through video conferencing on Monday.

In her letter, the Congress general secretary in-charge of U.P. claimed that Varanasi’s weavers were very “worried and frustrated”.

“The families of the weavers of Banarasi sarees, famous in the whole world, are desperate to make ends meet. Due to the coronavirus pandemic and government policies, the entire business of weavers has been destroyed despite the fact that they have made Uttar Pradesh’s name famous with their craft for ages,” Ms. Vadra said in her letter in Hindi.

“The Uttar Pradesh government should help them in this difficult period,” Ms. Vadra added.

She said the UPA government had implemented a scheme of providing weavers electricity at a flat rate in 2006 but the BJP government has done “injustice” to the weavers by discontinuing that scheme.

According to Ms. Vadra, the weavers said when they held a strike against the arbitrary power bills, officials had assured them that their problems would be looked into but no efforts had been made to solve their problems.

Listing her demands, she wrote, “The scheme to provide electricity to them at flat rate be restored, their “harassment” in the name of “fake” outstanding bills be stopped and their electricity connections should not be cut while the already cut connections be restored.

Doctors in West Bengal have called for increased COVID-19 testing and caution during this crucial period between the just-concluded Durga Puja and festivals that are round the corner.

“In West Bengal, the number of cases vis-a-vis the number of tests has remained almost static since the last few days. But the number of cases in five worst-affected districts [Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly] remains to be a matter of concern. We need to really increase tests all over the State. It is a pity that till now we could test about 44,000/day, and even less in the last couple of days,” Dr. Koushik Chaki of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum told The Hindu.

Also read | In Kolkata, empty pandals and roads mark Durga Puja

“Awareness among people is sadly far less than expected. A section of people did not follow the restrictions imposed by the Calcutta High Court, and now a few more festivals are about to come,” he said.

A clear picture about the impact of the Durga Puja celebrations on the COVID-19 situation is yet to emerge, considering only three days have passed since the festival ended. Even though the celebrations, by and large, remained muted, some of the popular pandals in Kolkata as well as neighbouring towns ended up drawing large crowds despite restrictions. And now doctors are concerned about Deepawali, when many end up bursting crackers despite strictures.

Bursting of crackers

“Deepawali is a festival of lights and firecrackers, and COVID-19 is a disease mostly involving airways, so situation will be terrible if strict rules are not enforced for avoidance of crackers. Another matter of concern is huge political rallies that are taking place. Organising them in the midst of a pandemic is not only an offence but also sends a very wrong signal to the common people. We condemn this and request all political parties to show restraint,” Dr. Chaki said.

“Also, with the winter season approaching, we need to be more vigilant. Countries in Europe have already started to face a fresh wave of infections, more lethal than before. Trace, test, isolate — this remains the key. Social norms need to be strictly imposed and those not complying should be penalised. The medical fraternity is struggling against all odds and their patience and capacity are stretching too tar.

The Supreme Court on Thursday did not order the immediate release from jail of ailing poet-activist Varavara Rao even as it voiced concern over a month-long delay witnessed in the Bombay High Court to hear urgent pleas for his liberty and medical treatment.

“The obstacle bothering us is that the matter is not being heard”, Justice U.U. Lalit, heading a three-judge Bench, said.

The last hearing of the case before the High Court was on September 17.

The court requested the Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court to list the case for hearing at the earliest.

‘Three dimensions’

Justice Lalit said the case had “three dimensions”. One, a competent court had taken cognisance of the case, and thus, Mr. Rao's detention was not per se illegal. Second, the question of bail was, again, under the consideration of the High Court. Finally, the issue of setting Mr. Rao at liberty, either on merits of the case or on medical grounds, was being looked into by the high court.

“So, how do we [Supreme Court] hear the case now”, Justice Lalit asked.

Mr. Rao, 79, was arrested in August 2018 in the Elgar Parishad case. He has been accused of offences under the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the National Investigation Act. His wife, Pendyala Hemalatha, through senior advocate Indira Jaising, has approached the apex court.

“So much time has elapsed. His condition has deteriorated. His life is in danger if he is not given proper treatment. It has been a month since the High Court listed the case... Even under detention, I have my fundamental rights. My right to life includes my right to health and dignity”, Ms. Jaising submitted.

Back to hospital issue

At one point, the Bench considered sending Mr. Rao back to the Nanavati Hospital where his condition was stable. Justice Lalit said Mr. Rao could be medically observed in the hospital till the High Court took a call.

But Solicitor General Tushar Mehta intervened to submit that every prisoner’s health was a concern for the State and such an order in Mr. Rao’s case may lead to other prisoners also seeking the same relief on medical grounds.

“That should not deter us... If the health condition of every prisoner requires that [sending him or her to the hospital for treatment], then every prisoner should be sent. Health is health... Who would want a death in jail?” Justice S. Ravindra Bhat, on the Bench, reacted to Mr. Mehta.

Ms. Hemalatha said her husband needed critical medical care. He had become very feeble in custody. He suffered from neurological problems and the aftereffects of COVID-19 infection, which he got while in custody.

Suffers head injury

Mr. Rao had suffered a fall at St. George Hospital and injured his head. A medical report on July 30 from the Nanavati Hospital, ordered by the High Court, found that the COVID-19 attack and his fall led to neurological problems.

On August 17, the High Court said that “considering the co-morbid factors of age, persistent hyponatremia in COVID-19 case, the patient will require close monitoring”.

Ms. Jaising recounted how Mr. Rao was hurriedly discharged from the Nanavati Hospital just to “avoid judicial determination of his bail on medical grounds”.

Ms. Hemalatha said the continuing custody of her husband was a punishment in itself not permissible in law.

85,2020/10/29,Coronavirus | Supreme Court to seek government response on plea on COVID-19 drugs,"WHO warned Remdesivir, Favipiravir not officially declared antidote for virus: Petitioner.

The Supreme Court on Thursday decided to alert the government and get its response on a plea about the uncertified use of Remdesivir and Favipiravir as COVID-19 drugs.

Appearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde, advocate M.L. Sharma drew the court’s attention to a report issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in October warning that both the drugs have not been officially declared an antidote for the virus.

Chief Justice Bobde said the court will issue notice to the government to make the latter aware of the development.

Mr. Sharma, in his petition, sought a CBI investigation on how these two medicines have been wrongly manufactured and sold for treating COVID-19 patients without any valid licences from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation.

He has sought prosecution of Indian companies selling them under the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.

He said companies were manufacturing and selling them at very high rates in India and people were paying “due to the fear of COVID-19 infection”. This amounted to the “exploitation of the public”.

Mr. Sharma pointed out that the process is on to import a vaccine. “The Prime Minister has already initiated process with Russia to import COVID-19 vaccine to manufacture/distribute in India through PSU Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Corporation Limited (BIBCOL),” the petition said.

Abhinandan after India’s attack threat, claims PMLN leader","A Pakistani opposition leader has claimed that Indian Air Force pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was released after Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told a meeting of Pakistan’s top leaders that India would attack Pakistan.

Recalling the tension in Islamabad after India bombed a terror training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot on February 26, 2019, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Sardar Ayaz Sadiq criticised the Imran Khan government over its response, saying the Opposition has supported the government on every issue, including Kashmir and Wing Commander Varthaman, but it will no longer be appropriate to provide any further support, Dunya News reported on October 28.

Mr. Sadiq, who was the Speaker of the National Assembly during the PML-N government, made a similar statement earlier on October 28 in Parliament that Foreign Minister Qureshi in an important meeting pleaded that let Wing Commander Varthaman go back because India is attacking Pakistan.

The 37-year-old IAF pilot was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27, 2019 after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets during aerial combat.

The Supreme Court on Thursday deferred the National Green Tribunal (NGT) proceedings indefinitely and ordered LG Polymers to file its response to a Joint Monitoring Committee report highlighting many lacunae in the functioning of its Visakhapatnam plant prior to a gas leak on May 7 leaving 12 dead and several injured.

A Bench led by Justice U.U. Lalit gave LG Polymers 10 days’ time as a “last opportunity” to file its objections to the report which was uploaded on the NGT website on May 23.

Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said the company “could not” file its response to the report after June 1 due to several unexpected reasons.

“We are willing to defer the hearing for you to file the objections to the report,” Justice Lalit told Mr. Rohatgi.

The Bench scheduled a hearing for November 16.

On June 15, the Supreme Court stayed an NGT order of June 1, which directed LG Polymers to pay ₹50 crore for the restoration of environment and payment of interim compensation to victims of the gas leak.

On June 1, the tribunal also directed the framing of a “restoration plan”, final quantification of the compensation to be paid to victims and action against officials responsible for allowing the company to function without statutory clearances. All of these directions were stayed by the Supreme court.

LG Polymers had appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging the jurisdiction of the tribunal to take up the case suo motu and direct the company to pay the compensation, especially when the case was already pending in the Andhra Pradesh High Court.

The company had also questioned the High Court order to seal the Visakhapatnam factory and premises. The company argued the sealing was unconstitutional.

The High Court had also sought information on how the toxic styrene monomer was allowed to be transported to South Korea despite the registration of a crime in connection with the May 7 leak, the appointment of a probe team and the requirement of a magisterial enquiry.

The High Court had even asked the Centre and the Andhra government to provide the net worth of LG Polymers Pvt.

The committee asked Amazon to give answers to these questions in writing, signed by its top-most officials.

Amid the soaring prices of onion, Union Minister for Agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar has said one lakh tonne of buffer stock of the key kitchen staple is being released by the government to provide relief to people.

He was talking to reporters on Wednesday after taking part in a rally in Dharampuri town of Indore district ahead of the November 3 bypolls to 28 Assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh.

“The government has already taken cognisance of the issue of rising prices of onion and its one lakh tonne of buffer stock is being released through NAFED,” Tomar said.

“We had imposed a ban on the export of onion from the country well in time and opened routes for its import,” the Minister said.

NCP chief and former union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar on Wednesday blamed the central government’s policies for the rising prices of onion, and said he would speak to the Centre about the stock limit imposed on the commodity traders.

Referring to Congress’s protests on the new farm laws, Mr. Tomar accused the opposition party of having double standards.

In its 2019 Lok Sabha poll manifesto, the Congress promised to make trade free of regulations, he said.

The Congress had also said it would encourage inter- state trade, discontinue the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs), give encouragement to contract farming and end the Essential Commodities Act, he said.

“But it was unable to do these things because of pressure from middlemen,” the Minister claimed.

“The BJP-led government framed new laws for agriculture reforms. Therefore, the Congress is now suffering from stomachache,” he added.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected an appeal by the Delhi government against the grant of bail to Pinjra Tod activist Devangana Kalita in a case connected to the riots that rocked north-east Delhi in February.

A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan dismissed the government’s plea that Ms. Kalita was an “influential person”. The court said bail could not be denied merely because a person had influence. The court questioned the apprehensions raised by the government that Ms. Kalita would tamper with the witnesses.

The High Court had granted her bail saying the witnesses in the case were mostly police officers. The court, in its bail order on September 1, concluded that the police had shown no evidence to back their claim that Ms. Kalita instigated communal violence or hate speech. It said she was engaged in a peaceful protest, which was her fundamental right.

96,2020/10/29,Confession to officers under NDPS act not admissible: Supreme Court,"Confessions made by accused persons to officials invested with powers of an “officer-in-charge of a police station” under the draconian Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act are not admissible as evidence during court trial, the Supreme Court held on Thursday.

Any use of such “confessional statements” would be an infringement of the fundamental right of privacy and the right against self-incrimination of the accused person, a three-judge Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman held in a majority verdict. Justice Indu Malhotra, on the Bench, dissented.

“The interpretation of a statute like the NDPS Act must needs be in conformity and in tune with the spirit of the broad fundamental right not to incriminate oneself, and the right to privacy... A person’s privacy is not to be trifled with, because if it is, the officer who trifles with it is himself punishable under the provision,” the court observed.

The judgment interpreted Section 53 of the NDPS Act. Under this provision, the Central government, in consultation with the State, can invest officials of certain departments like central excise, narcotics, customs, revenue intelligence or even paramilitary or armed forces, with the powers of a police officer.

Confessions made before a police officer are inadmissible in court as per the Evidence Act. The question before the court was whether officers empowered under Section 53 could actually be a “police officer” in all sense of the term.

Confirming that they are, Justices Nariman and Navin Sinha, forming the majority on the Bench, said “any confessional statement made to them [officials empowered under Section 53] would be barred under the Evidence Act, and cannot be taken into account in order to convict an accused under the NDPS Act”.

“A statement recorded under Section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be used as a confessional statement in the trial of an offence under the NDPS Act,” the majority opinion held.

“Where limited powers of investigation are given to officers primarily or predominantly for some purpose other than the prevention and detection of crime, such persons cannot be said to be police officers,” the court held.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/x1c35/article32837640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TH-LTSUPREMECOURTOFINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/confession-to-officers-under-ndps-act-not-admissible-sc/article32976101.ece

99,2020/10/29,"Hit by setbacks, Maoists trying to regain hold in Visakha Agency","The outlawed outfit starts pumping in the armed cadre of PLGA from Chhattisgarh

Since May 2016, the CPI (Maoist) has been facing a series of setbacks in the Visakha Agency and it appears that the banned outfit is losing its grip slowly. To consolidate its presence, the organisation, it is learnt, is restructuring its set-up and strengthening the cadre base by infusing armed cadres from their PLGA wing in Chhattisgarh.

Recently, according to sources, movement of about 20 PLGA cadres from Chhattisgarh were noticed in the Galikonda region. The PLGA (People’s Liberation Guerilla Army) is the armed fighting machine of the CPI (Maoist) and is directly under the control of Nambala Keshava Rao, general secretary of the party. Setbacks to the outfit in AOB, particularly in the Galikonda region, began with the killing of Gopal alias Azad, DCM (Divisional Committee Member of Galikonda area committee), in an alleged exchange of fire with the security forces in May 2016 in Marripakala of Koyyuru mandal. This was followed by the Ramaguda or Ramgarh exchange of fire in which 30 Maoists, including senior leaders such as Bakkuri Venkata Ramana, were killed in October 2016.

In February 2017, Gemmeli Narayan Rao alias Jambri, who was then heading the Galikonda area committee, was killed. This was followed by the surrender of Boda Anjayya alias Bhaskar alias Naveen in 2019. Naveen had succeeded Jambri. Later, over 14 cadres and militia members had surrendered from Galikonda area. Recently, Gemmeli Kamesh alias Hari, the present ACM of GAC and another senior militia member Krishna from Korukonda area were arrested and this created a void.

As part of the restructuring process, the Galikonda and Gurtedu areas have been merged under one area committee and the responsibility has been given to Kakuri Pandanna alias Jagan, to revive the movement. To strengthen the cadre base, as local recruits have dried down, armed cadres from Chhattisgarh have been pumped in. Similarly, it is learnt that Korukonda and Pedabayalu have been merged and Sudheer has been told to head it. Nandapur and Kalimela area committees have been made defunct and the cadres have been diverted towards Pedabayalu to strengthen the AOB region.

Strategic location

Sources in the intelligence wing say that leader Ranadev, who was heading Kalimela dalam, has been moved to Boipariguda area, north of Sileru. This is a strategic logistic location, as it connects Odisha with Andhra border, according to Inspector-General of Police Ch. Srikanth. Senior leader Krishna has been told to head the cut-off region and the entire East Division is now being headed by Aruna. Aruna, who was earlier heading the Nandpur dalam, gained prominence after successfully leading the assault and killing of Araku MLA K. Sarveswara Rao and former MLA S. Soma in September 2018.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/4unui6/article32969159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23ONGMAOISTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hit-by-setbacks-maoists-trying-to-regain-hold-in-visakha-agency/article32969160.ece
100,2020/10/29,Tobacco regulations: farmers urge Centre to seek their views,"‘Illegal cigarette trade is a threat to livelihoods of ryots’

Tobacco farmers have urged the Centre to hold consultations with them, being the main stakeholders, while framing any regulations pertaining to the cultivation of the crop.

On the World Tobacco Growers’ Day on Wednesday, the representatives of the farmers from the Southern Light Soil and Southern Black Soil regions urged the Union Government to help them produce tobacco leaf on par with international standards.

Tobacco Board Vice-Chairman Konda Reddy said the proliferation of illegal cigarette trade in the country has undermined the tobacco control policies of the government. The illicit trade is also impacting the growers’ earnings adversely following the reduction in demand for the domestically grown crop.

Federation of All India Farmers Association (FAIFA) general secretary P.S. Murali Babu said the demand for FCV tobacco had reduced considerably post 2013-14 owing to the sharp decline in legal cigarette volumes on account of high taxes and expansion of illegal cigarette trade.

Production declines

“The trade remains a threat to the livelihoods of farmers. Reports suggest that India is the fourth largest illegal cigarette market in the world,” he lamented. Farmers who cultivated FCV tobacco in the drought-prone region have incurred a loss of at least ₹4,000 crore following the reduction in production from 325 million kg in 2014-15 fiscal to 210 million kg in last financial year, pointed out Vaddela Vara Prasad, president of Service and Welfare Organisation for Rythu Development.

SBS Farmers Welfare Organisation president P. Bhadri Reddy said the tobacco sector provides employment to more than 45 million people. There is no alternative to tobacco in view of the persistent drought condition, he said while referring to studies conducted by the CTRI, Rajamahendravaram.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/70zv27/article32969151.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29ONG4TOBACCO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tobacco-regulations-farmers-urge-centre-to-seek-their-views/article32969152.ece
101,2020/10/29,Parents oppose scrapping of ‘Best Available Schools’ scheme,"Parents of several students staged dharna in front of the Balayogi Gurukul school on the outskirts of Kadapa on Wednesday, denouncing the State government’s decision to scrap the Best Available Schools scheme.

Parents of several students staged dharna in front of the Balayogi Gurukul school on the outskirts of Kadapa on Wednesday, denouncing the State government’s decision to scrap the Best Available Schools scheme.

Launched in the 1980s, the scheme that entailed provision of free seats to eligible SC/ST students in private schools was touted to be among the top welfare schemes meant for SC/ST students. The State government’s announcement to do away with the scheme, in view of the enhanced focus given to school education amid the launch of ‘Amma Vodi’, ‘Nadu Nedu’, has not gone well with the two communities, who demanded that the G.O. on repealing the scheme be withdrawn immediately.

“Instead of rectifying anomalies, if any, it is not right to strike down a scheme that benefits the poorer social sections,” an affected parent said. Another parent was worried if he would have to pay a hefty fee for admitting his ward in a corporate school or leave him in the social welfare school.

On the flip side, the scheme came under fire for remaining unnoticed for long, with neither the Education department, nor the Social Welfare department monitoring its implementation. Contacted by The Hindu, Andhra Pradesh School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission member and a retired professor V. Narayana Reddy said the scheme had been thoroughly misused over the last decade by certain private schools.

“Some treated it as a main source of income by managing the welfare department to get their schools approved even without hostels and students not staying there. The money sanctioned to these target groups is snatched away by the private managements,” he explained.

Though the authorities had brought the loopholes to the notice of the erstwhile TDP government, no action was initiated then, Prof. Reddy said, hailing the incumbent regime for taking steps to streamline the scheme to benefit the real target groups.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vyztln/article32969104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29VJBALAYOGISCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/parents-oppose-scrapping-of-best-available-schools-scheme/article32967761.ece

103,2020/10/29,Political parties demand fresh elections to local bodies,"Probe sought into violence that marred the nomination process

The major political parties requested State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar at the all-party meeting held on Wednesday that the local body elections should be held afresh keeping in view of the alleged massive irregularities and violence that vitiated the filing of nominations, which led to their postponement.

Telugu Desam Party State unit president K. Atchannaidu insisted that the process of elections should be carried out afresh and online nomination system must be followed. He stressed on the need to order an inquiry into the violent incidents that prompted the SEC to defer the polls. Besides, he said the TDP had no confidence in the State police machinery and polling machinery should be deployed from outside.

Terming unanimous elections to the urban and rural local bodies as a fraud, BJP leader Paka Satyanarayana demanded their cancellation and issue of a fresh notification. He requested Mr. Ramesh Kumar to draw observers from other States to ensure free and fair elections, and to hold a meeting with officials of the Medical and Health Department to arrive at safety measures to be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Congress State working president Shaik Masthanvali said all “rigged” elections should be cancelled and a fresh notification be issued, and that he was shocked to note that the officials whom the SEC had ordered to be removed, were still not relieved of their duties. He sought clarity on the creation of new districts and suggested that the number of polling stations be increased.

Jana Sena Party vice-president B. Mahender Reddy stated in a representation to the SEC that it should take further course of action on the elections strictly in accordance with the norms of the Election Commission of India. He wanted the violence that marred the filing of nominations in February/March to be investigated.

CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna and CPI(M) leader Y. Venkateswara Rao said the elections that were already held should be cancelled and the fresh election schedule should be finalised after due consultation with the government and officials of the Medical and Health Department.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/olfqv2/article32967702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29VJATCHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/political-parties-demand-fresh-elections-to-local-bodies/article32967703.ece

108,2020/10/29,CM asks officials to ensure MSP for all crops,"‘Farm produce damaged by rain should be procured at remunerative prices’

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has asked the officials to ensure that no crop is purchased at less than the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and the payments should be done in ten days of the purchase.

In a review meeting on the Comprehensive Monitoring of Agriculture Prices and Procurement (CMAPP) and e-marketing on Wednesday, the Chief Minister insisted that no farmer should incur losses and instructed the officials to take immediate action on receiving alerts of farmers selling away their produce below the MSP.

He insisted that information about the MSP for crops should be made available at all the 10,641 Rythu Bharosa Kendras in the State on a daily basis.

The Chief Minister asked the officials to take necessary measures for the procurement of paddy, groundnut and cotton damaged in the recent rains at remunerative prices.

The officials informed Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy that 5,812 crop purchase centres had been set up across the State as it was estimated that 1,09,24,524 metric tonnes of crops were expected to be harvested this kharif season.

Payment gateways

The Chief Minister also stressed on strengthening the security and payment gateways, along with delivery logistics and ensuring smooth transactions between the buyers and sellers.

109,2020/10/29,Tax remission sought on FCV tobacco exports,"‘Illegal cigarette trade is taking a toll on livelihood of farmers’

The Federation of All India Farmer Associations (FAIFA) has appealed to the Centre to include FCV tobacco in the Remission of Duties or Taxes on Export Product (RoDTEP) scheme and encourage exports through aggressive promotion schemes.

The Centre has removed incentives for tobacco export, making the country a weak competitor in the global market, whereas other countries such as Zimbabwe, Malawi and etc. are encouraging their tobacco farmers by doling out incentives and subsidies, said Javare Gowda, president of FAIFA.

The FAIFA organised a gathering of farmers in various tobacco growing locations of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in strict comliance with the COVID-19 protocols on Wednesday, marking the World Tobacco Growers’ Day. It also appealed to the government to adopt a consultative approach and include tobacco farmers while framing tobacco control regulations.

“FCV tobacco growers have incurred losses of over ₹6,000 crore, with a drop in production from 325 million kg in 2014-15 to 210 million kg in 2019-20. This is because of the rise in illicit cigarette trade in India on account of higher and punitive taxation on cigarettes due to which legal cigarette sales have dropped significantly,” said Javare Gowda, president, Federation of All India Farmer Associations (FAIFA).

At present, India is the fourth largest and fastest growing illegal cigarette market in the world. The market in India has doubled from 13.5 billion sticks in 2006 to 28 billion sticks in 2019, he said.

”As smuggled cigarettes do not use Indian tobacco, the offtake of tobacco for the manufacture of legal cigarettes in India is declining. As a result, FCV cultivation is reducing and farmers are incurring a loss in excess of ₹1300 crore every year. We demand strict regulations to curb the illicit cigarette trade,” he said.

FAIFA vice-president Gadde Seshagiri Rao said that tobacco sector provides direct and indirect employment to more than 45.7 million people, around 70% of whom are in the agricultural sector. Tobacco is a highly remunerative crop providing economic benefits to farmers .

”Studies conducted by the Central Tobacco Research Institute (CTRI) have also shown that there is no other equally remunerative crop in the tobacco growing regions. Hence, it is important that Government of India extends the required support to FCV growers in meeting international standards,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tax-remission-sought-on-fcv-tobacco-exports/article32967555.ece

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday wrote a letter to Union Minister for Communications, Electronics and Information Technology and Law & Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad, requesting him to direct the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block the applications and websites associated with online gaming, gambling and betting in the State.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy attached a list of 132 such websites and apps with this letter on which he wanted the Centre to act. He said that online gaming, gambling and betting websites had become a social evil as the youth were indulging in them from the comforts of their homes through cellphones and computers.

Even as gambling and betting in their usual form can be easily identified, their online operations are difficult to trace, he said.

The State government has recently declared online gaming, gambling and betting as illegal by under the A.P. Gaming Act, 1974, by promulgating an ordinance, which was notified on September 25. One of the key features of the Act is making those assisting in the operation of the online gaming, gambling and betting liable for punishment.

“This is where the role of ISPs can be termed as the assisting factor as the websites are not blocked. Stopping illegal gaming and betting is not possible without cooperation of ISPs. They should be instructed to block the websites to help the government curb the menace,” he wrote.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/n2x9m/article32967533.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29VIJ3ONLINEBETTING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cm-wants-betting-apps-sites-blocked-by-isps/article32967534.ece

113,2020/10/29,New butterfly species seen in Visakhapatnam district,"Study conducted in Eastern Ghats over a period of time

When a team of three nature enthusiasts embarked upon a study to document butterflies of Visakhapatnam district, little did they realise that they would chance upon butterfly species never before recorded in the region.

A study done by Appanna Saragada, E. Ramakrishna and Ramana Bhusala has brought to light a number of species that made their presence felt for the first time in the Eastern Ghats bordering Visakhapatnam and its urban ecological hotspots. The research was done over a period of time in Araku, Sileru, Chintapalli, Devarapalli Hills, Anantagiri, Kailasagiri and Simhachalam Hills.

The newly recorded species from Visakhapatnam region include African marbled skipper, tree flitter, chestnut angle, chestnut bob, fluffy tit, colour sergeant and double banded crow.

Among the recent finds, three species fall under the protected (Schedule) category of Wildlife Protection Act (1972). These are the marbled map, orange tail awl and tree flitter.

“When we put together all our records and collated with past findings, we knew that we had discovered something very special this time,” said Ramana, Forest Section Officer, Visakhapatnam Division. He along with his two teammates had been touring the interior parts of Visakhapatnam’s Eastern Ghats and forest range for the past six years to collect data on butterflies. The pictorial evidences of all newly recorded species were captured with a Nikon DSLR 5300 camera and 300 mm and 105 macro lenses.

Protected under Schedule II of Wildlife Protection Act, the marbled map or Cyrestis cocles, for instance, is listed as a ‘rare’ butterfly species confined to the hilly forests in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bhutan and Myanmar. Four years ago, it made a chance entry into the thick forests of the Eastern Ghats near Maredumilli mandal in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh.

‘Little research’

Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) Rahul Pandey welcomed the news and said that while the Eastern Ghats is not known to be very high in density for butterflies, little research is being done in this zone. “Such studies will bring focus on this region’s flora and fauna,” he said.

Dolphin Nature Conservation Society (DNCS) founder and president M. Rama Murthy said that butterflies are a very good indicator to judge how sound the biodiversity and ecology of the area is. “The Eastern Ghats has been drawing a good number of researchers in the recent past. More such collaborative efforts need to be done for better understanding of butterfly species of the region,” he said.

DNCS has been undertaking periodical survey of the region and in 2018 had presented a study recording new butterfly species visiting Visakhapatnam district.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ue8dcu/article32967494.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28-VZ-NEWBUTTERFLIES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/new-butterfly-species-seen-in-visakhapatnam-district/article32967495.ece
114,2020/10/29,CITU urges working class to oppose ‘anti-people’ policies of Centre,"‘A nationwide strike will be organised on November 26’

Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) State president Ch. Narasinga Rao has urged the working class to oppose the ‘anti-labour, anti-farmer and anti-people policies’ of the Centre.

At an extensive meeting of the CITU workers here on Wednesday, he said that COVID-19 was spreading fast in the country and it has reached the second position in the world. He alleged that the Centre instead of going to the rescue of workers in the pandemic situation was taxing them further by amending labour laws to promote corporate companies.

Mr. Narasinga Rao said that 44 labour laws were made into four labour codes to the detriment of workers and to benefit the managements. He alleged that privatisation was being done rapidly and hire and fire policies encouraged. A nationwide strike would be organised on November 26 against the ‘anti-people’ policies of the Union government. It would be preceded by an online public meeting on November 7.

CITU leader R.K.S.V. Kumar presided over the meeting.

CITU general secretary M. Jaggu Naidu, treasurer S. Jyothiswara Rao and leaders P.

Nagireddy on Wednesday said that the YSR Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBK) would register the crop damage details for compensation in case the data on the damaged crops goes missing during the enumeration carried out by the officials of the Revenue and Agriculture departments.

Mr. Nagireddy on Wednesday inspected the paddy fields inundated due to recent rains at Munagala and Kunavaram areas in Korukonda mandal, where he interacted with the farmers and ascertained the level of crop damage and its causes.

“Financial aid has been paid to the farmers, compensating them for various crops damaged during the rains reported since July in East Godavari district. The government is prepared to include the details of damaged crops at the RBKs if anything is missing from the enumeration exercise,” Mr. Nagireddy told reporters during the field inspection.

“We have decided to grant the compensation within one month of the crop damage. Farmers are requested to submit their representations to the Collector and Agriculture Department officials, explaining the reasons for the inundation and crop damage in the district in order to address those grievances,” Mr. Nagireddy said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rbks-to-register-data-on-damaged-crops/article32967442.ece
116,2020/10/29,Withdraw ‘anti-labour’ policies: BMS,"The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) has demanded withdrawal of the ‘anti-labour’ policies framed in the four labour codes by the Centre. A protest was organised by employees, owing allegiance to the Rashtriya Ispat Mazdoor Sangh, an affiliate of BMS, at the Steel Plant Gate near Kurmannapalem on Wednesday. BMS national vice president M. Jagadiswara Rao, Rashtriya Ispat Mazdoor Sangh general secretary S. Radha Krishnan and president Kommineni Srinivasa Rao deplored the policies. They recalled that the triennial national virtual conference of BMS held earlier this month had passed resolutions for the betterment of the labour class.

They said that labour reform does not mean scrapping labour rights. Increasing the duty hours from 8 to 12 hours was exploitation of labour apart from violation of the international standards, set by the ILO, they said.

Pension scheme should be treated as a fundamental right of an employee, who has served an organisation for a long period. The government should allocate budgetary support for the pension scheme. They wondered when an unorganised sector workman was getting a minimum pension of ₹3,000 what was the rationale in declaring ₹1,000 as minimum pension to EPS-95 pensioners.

They also demanded amendment and effective implementation of the Migrant Workmen Act.

117,2020/10/29,‘Spotting warning signs of stroke is crucial’,"Good diet, exercise can reduce risk of stroke by 80%, says doctor

Manipal Hospitals consultant neurologist Murali Cherukuri said that COVID-19 has the potential to cause various health issues in the long run, including stroke. He added that stroke is also the top-most ailment among various neurological complications that occur after being infected by COVID-19.

In view of World Stroke Day observed on October 29, Dr. Murali, in a release, emphasised the need for spotting warning signs of stroke and approaching doctors at the earliest.

He said that according to the World Stroke Organisation, 14.5 million people could face a stroke by end of 2020 and 5.5 million people could die as a result.

A stroke occurs when blood vessels in the brain are blocked, and one should reach for medical help when symptoms like sudden numbness or weakness of a leg, trouble seeing, loss of balance or coordination and severe headache with no known cause occur.

He said the transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are ‘warning strokes’ that can happen before a major stroke. Dr. Murali said tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) drug administered within three hours after a stroke can prevent long-term disability in the patient and it is most important to get to a hospital in time.

Dr. Murali further said that 80% strokes are preventable if a person manages blood pressure, eats healthy, exercises and avoids smoking.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/spotting-warning-signs-of-stroke-is-crucial/article32967370.ece

The Waltair Division of East Coast Railway is operating festival special trains for Deepavali and other festivals apart from COVID special trains. With the increase in frequency of train services, safety measures have been enhanced at all the railway stations over the division.

Divisional Railway Manager Chetan Kumar Shrivastava has appealed to passengers to follow the guidelines given by the railway administration for a safe and secure travel during the season. The DRM is reviewing the safety measures on a regular basis in view of the increase of passengers flow.

Manning of the gates at railway stations and also in the trains is being done to keep a check on the passengers without ticket or unauthorised travelling. Regular announcements are being made at railway stations to inform passengers that all these trains are fully reserved, according to Senior Divisional Commercial Manager A.K. Tripathi.

The railways have advised all the passengers to observe the precautions like wearing a mask properly and to maintain social distance to stop the spread of COVID-19 and for a safe journey. COVID-19 positive persons are not allowed into railway areas or to board a train.

Boarding a train after having been denied to undertake travel by the health check-up team at the railway station is an offence and violators would be punished.

124,2020/10/29,"YSRCP gave ₹12,000 crore to farmers in one year: Minister","Kannababu flays TDP for creating confusion by making allegations

Minister for Agriculture K. Kannababu has said that the YSR Congress Party government has extended a record amount of about ₹12,000 crore to farmers in the form of investment aid under Rythu Bharosa scheme in just one year, while the previous government could only waive ₹12,731 crore worth loans between 2014 and 2019.

Addressing a press conference here on Wednesday, Mr. Kannababu criticised the allegations of Telugu Desam Party that the YSRCP government was not going to give ₹77,500 to each farmer. It was ridiculous on part of the TDP to say that a farmer would have received ₹77,500 had TDP been voted to power, he said.

The TDP was only confusing farmers by making allegations that farmers were going to lose such an amount just because TDP promised it during elections, Mr. Kannababu said.

He said the YSRCP was keeping its promise and even increased the amount by a thousand making it ₹13,500 per year and ₹67,5000 for five years.

He said the State government had deposited input subsidy regarding crops damaged in July, August and September to farmers’ accounts on October 27 in record time.

He said that a GO issued in 2015 specified that crop damage compensation should be given only if the fields were inundated for more than a week, and the YSRCP government was following the same without making any changes.

He has urged the State government to take an all-party delegation to the Centre to seek funds for undertaking relief and repair work. The government should also convene a legislature session to discuss the problems faced by the flood-affected people, he said.

In a letter to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Thursday, Mr. Siddaramaiah said the government had not paid compensation to more than one lakh house owners whose houses were destroyed in last year’s rains. Though 2.47 lakh houses were destroyed in 2019, compensation of ₹5 lakh was paid to some of the 1.24 lakh house owners. Some house owners received just ₹1 lakh, he claimed.

“This year’s monsoon destroyed crops, houses and public infrastructure even more. While crops on 15 lakh hectares were destroyed in 2020, about 10 lakh hectares was affected in 2019.

The Congress leader, who toured Bidar, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Bagalkot and other rain-devastated districts a few days ago, said the sowing of crops this year had exceeded the target on more than 30% of the targeted area, but the floods had destroyed the crops. Crops such as groundnut, maize, jowar, paddy, onion, oilseeds, and commercial crops such as coffee and cotton were destroyed.

130,2020/10/29,My husband’s work in Sira constituency is my strength: Ammajamma,"JD(S) candidate is preparing to face her first election

Ammajamma, the 61-year-old Janata Dal (S) candidate for the byelection to Sira Assembly constituency, is in the thick of campaigning though she only recently recovered from COVID-19. The bypoll was necessitated by the death of her husband and Sira legislator B. Sathyanarayana. In her first outing in electoral politics, Ms. Ammajamma has been seeking votes as the “daughter of the taluk”.

In a brief interview with The Hindu, she spoke about her entry into politics and her campaign.

This is your first election. How do you feel?

I was not involved in politics much as my husband was an active participant. But people are responding well when I go for canvassing for votes now.

What are the issues on which you are seeking votes?

I am seeking votes on the good work done by the party. My husband has contributed to the development of the taluk. He did not discriminate and was popular among all. I am seeking votes upon the contribution of former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy.

You were reluctant to contest initially. Why?

There was some amount of fear about entering politics and I was anxious. I was also not well as I was down with COVID -19.

Many JD(S) leaders have left the party. Are you worried about it?

It’s an old story now. JD(S) workers are still around and enthusiastically campaigning. My husband had taken good care of party workers. The arrival of Mr. Gowda in Sira for campaigning has changed the scene on the ground.

Are you getting support from the party workers?

All the workers are supporting me. My strength and confidence comes from the fact that Mr. Gowda and Mr. Kumaraswamy have been very helpful and have been backing me well. The party legislators are also campaigning on my behalf.

You are pitted against veteran T.B. Jayachandra and debutant Rajesh Gowda. How do you fancy your chances?

My husband’s work in the constituency is my strength. I am confident of voters standing by me. There are many women voters in Sira constituency who I think will vote for me.

From what was expected to be a walkover for Munirathna, the R.R. Nagar byelection has now turned out to be a hot arena for the BJP candidate, who has represented it twice as a Congress leader.

Continued dissidence within the BJP against his candidature and an attempt to consolidate Vokkaliga votes against him by the Congress are the key challenges Mr. Munirathna faces, according to sources close to him. The JD(S), which has a considerable base in the constituency, has also been running a high-pitched campaign, turning into an “X factor” in the bypoll.

Tulasi Muniraju Gowda, a two-time BJP candidate against Mr. Munirathna, has been fighting a pitched battle against him, even challenging his 2018 election victory over malpractice. From the RSS stable, he lobbied hard to prevent Mr. Munirathna’s entry into the BJP and later against giving him the party ticket, but failed. Mr. Gowda has not been active in the campaign, said sources. Mr. Munirathna also had a bitter feud with local councillors — three women from three parties — when he was a Congress MLA. Multiple BJP councillors are also not actively campaigning for him.

“The party’s worker base has not forgotten those days,” said a former BJP councillor, though Mr. Munirathna himself has been insisting that the old differences were buried. He is banking on Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s campaign in BJP strongholds to directly appeal to the party’s loyal vote base, bypassing the local leaders. He has also ushered in star power, with actor-turned-politician Khushboo campaigning for him and actor Darshan expected to join as well.

Meanwhile, running his campaign aggressively are three former Congress councillors, who shifted to the BJP with him. One of them, G.K. Venkatesh, was accused of trying to disrupt Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah’s rally, and was arrested and later released on bail.

Strong base in slums

However, what Mr. Munirathna is banking on is his base in the constituency, especially in the slum pockets, which goes beyond party or caste loyalties. “In these pockets, he got insurmountable leads in the previous two elections. He has tremendous goodwill there. For instance, he called most of the households in these areas personally during the recent lockdown and supplied them ration for three months,” a Congress leader conceded.

Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar and his brother and local MP D.K. Suresh, spearheading the Congress campaign, are attempting a Vokkaliga vote consolidation, given that Mr. Munirathna has had run-ins with Vokkaligas in the constituency. As opposed to this, the Congress candidate and new entrant H. Kusuma, a Vokkaliga, comes with no baggage and is seen as polished and educated.

However, BJP strategists are hopeful that the Congress’ “overt attempt at Vokkaliga consolidation” will push other communities, especially the OBCs, to the BJP. However, they fear that the attempt to disrupt a rally of Mr. Siddaramaiah, a prominent OBC leader, may cause some damage.

JD(S) revs up campaign

The Congress’ attempt at Vokkaliga consolidation has upset the JD(S), with former H.D. Kumaraswamy wary of Mr. Shivakumar’s attempt to project himself as the big leader of the community, party sources said. The JD(S), that initially did not seem serious in the constituency, has picked up and is running a pitched campaign with Mr. Kumaraswamy himself in the lead and making a focused attack on the Congress. The JD(S) has a considerable base in the constituency, winning 40,000 to 60,000 votes since 2008. While BJP and Congress leaders claim the election is fast turning into a two-horse race, the JD(S) is keen to make its presence felt, and this might hurt the Congress.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/r0lvuh/article32976376.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGMUNIRATHNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/its-old-loyalties-vs-old-rivalries-for-munirathna-in-rr-nagar-bypoll/article32976377.ece
132,2020/10/29,"Citing harassment, IPS officer resigns","Ravindranath says he has been facing problems created by a few individuals

IPS officer P. Ravindranath, who holds the post of Additional Director General of Police in the Forest Cell, tendered his resignation to the Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar through Karnataka DGP Praveen Sood citing harassment. This comes following the promotion of senior IPS officers who were junior to him.

In his resignation letter dated October 28, Mr. Ravindranath stated that over the last four years he has been facing “problems created by a few individuals”, but did not elaborate about the nature of the harassment or the people behind it.

Case in 2014

The IPS officer came under investigation in 2014 for reportedly taking photos of a woman on his mobile phone camera at a coffee shop in Bengaluru. At the time, a case was filed against him. In his letter, he stated that he had approached the Central Administrative Tribunal and High Court, and obtained relief. “The recent Supreme Court order dated October 15 gave me justice in my service matters. But a few individuals prevented justice,” he said in the letter.

Regarding the promotions, he told the media that he would seek legal recourse to claim his rights.

Sources in the Home Department said that senior officers are trying to convince Mr. Ravindranath to withdraw his resignation. “The episode has caused major embarrassment to the department at a time when the government is busy with the bypolls,” said sources.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/citing-harassment-ips-officer-resigns/article32976218.ece

134,2020/10/29,"New rules to ban government employees from acting in films, TV serials","Karnataka State Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 2020, have been notified.

The State government has decided to ban its employees from acting in films and television serials, publishing books, and voicing criticism against the State and Union government policies.

A draft of the Karnataka State Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 2020, said that they cannot act in films and television serials without permission from the competent authority. The draft rules also seek to stop government staff from sponsoring media programmes in radio and television channels.

Objection in 15 days

The Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms notified these draft rules on October 27, 2020, seeking objections within 15 days. The rule said a government servant should not publish any book or engage him/herself habitually in literary or artistic or scientific work without the permission of prescribed authority.

A new set of rules, likely to be enforced soon, also states that government servants cannot consume intoxicating drinks in public places. It also prohibited employees appearing in a public place in a state of intoxication. The rules also seek to ban employees from embarking on foreign tours without permission. “No government servant shall undertake a private foreign tour without prior permission from the prescribed authority,” state the rules.

Dress code

Related to dress code, the rules state that every government servant should cultivate the habit of wearing “decent dresses” in office and wear uniforms wherever such uniform is prescribed for a category of post.

New rules drafted under 39 different heads have prescribed political neutrality; principles of merit, fairness and impartiality in the discharge of his or her duties; accountability and transparency; responsiveness to the public; and courtesy and good behaviour with the public by employees.

The rules would be applicable to about six lakh government employees.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/k5an6m/article32976201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGVIDHANASOUDHA4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/new-rules-to-ban-government-employees-from-acting-in-films-tv-serials/article32976202.ece
135,2020/10/29,‘BJP using wrong methods to win co-operative society polls’,"M.Y. Patil, Afzalpur MLA, accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of adopting wrong practices to win the taluk Agricultural Produce Co-operative Marketing Society (Vyavasaya Seva Sahakara Sangha) elections to be held on November 5.

Addressing presspersons in the city on Thursday, Mr. Patil alleged that the names of voters belonging to particular communities were being deleted surreptitiously from the electoral rolls. Out of 1,466 eligible voters for the society elections, the names of 1,195 voters were removed from the list, he said.

“Though I am president of the society, my name was removed from the electoral list, the supporters of former Minister Mallikayya Guttedar had deleted 80% of the names from the voters’' list and kept the names of few families that support the BJP,” he alleged.

Condemning the BJP’s unruly behaviour, Mr. Patil said he would fight legally against the alleged violation of election rules.

Ms. Jewargi and Mr. Patil from the BJP were the only candidates to have filed nomination papers for the elections to the two posts that were reserved for Scheduled Tribes (Woman) and general categories.

138,2020/10/29,19 candidates file nomination papers for DCC Bank polls,"BJP leaders working towards a consensus to avoid voting for 16 posts of directors and allow Ramesh Katti to continue as chairman

As many as 19 candidates filed their nomination papers for the 16 posts of directors of the District Central Cooperative Bank in Belagavi on Thursday, sending out a message that the elections will not be unanimous.

Thursday was the last date for filing nomination papers. Friday will see scrutiny of nomination papers and Saturday is the last date for withdrawal of nomination papers. Polling is scheduled for November 6.

BJP leaders, on the other hand, held a joint press conference saying that they were working towards a consensus to avoid voting on polling day. They also hinted that they were trying to allow the former MP Ramesh Katti to have his fifth term as bank chairman. S.G. Dhavaleshwar, a representative of the industries sector, is likely to continue as the bank vice-chairman.

The 16-member bank has 10 geographical constituencies and six sectoral constituencies, including urban banks, silk and wool farmers, Karnataka Milk Federation and industries.

The Returning Officer received one set of nomination paper each from seven of the 10 taluks. Just one candidate filed nomination papers from the six sectoral constituencies.

The three taluks that received multiple nomination papers are Khanapur, Ramdurg and Bailhongal.

First-time MLA Anjali Nimbalkar is challenging former MLA and MES leader from Khanapur Arvind Patil.

She told journalists that she met Mr. Ramesh Katti seeking his advice six months ago when she began planning for the elections. “I am here to help farmers and the rural poor. I have built a cooperative organisation that has active workers of Congress, BJP and MES,” she said. She insisted that no one had approached her for a consensus and ruled out withdrawing from the race. She said that she had begun preparations for voting on November 6.

BJP leaders, however, say that efforts will be made to convince the additional candidates to withdraw from the race on Saturday. They are banking on BJP MLA Balachandra Jarkiholi to request his brother and Congress leader Satish Jarkiholi to convince Dr. Nimbalkar to withdraw from the race. They don’t see a problem in urging the additional candidates from Bailhongal and Ramdurg to quit.

Despite repeated declarations by senior leaders that the DCC Bank polls are non-political, elections to the biggest lender in the district continue to have significant political implications.

Nomination papers are not filed on behalf of political parties and parties don’t issue ticket. But parties routinely back candidates who enter the fray.

Five years ago, the BJP camp was divided when the Katti brothers convinced the government nominee to side with them, to defeat Laxman Savadi (now Deputy Chief Minister) in the race to the chairmanship.

This time, the BJP has put in efforts to save such an embarrassment. RSS leader Arvind Rao Deshpande and leaders of the Sahakara Bharati, an affiliate of the Sangh Parivar, held two rounds of meetings with BJP leaders in Belagavi. Union Minister Prahald Joshi and BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel held meetings in Hubballi and Belagavi to iron out differences between the groups owing allegiance to different leaders.

Even on Thursday, BJP leaders held a closed door meeting in the DCC Bank office to work out modalities. Those in the know say that it was agreed that Mr. Laxman Savadi would be sent to Bengaluru as the DCC Bank representative to vote in the State-level polls to the Apex Bank.

MLA and Congress leader Ganesh Hukkeri, who had spoken of fighting the DCC Bank polls, did not submit his nomination papers on Thursday. This cleared the way for bank director Anna Saheb Jolle to get elected unopposed.

Shivanand Doni, a loyalist of the Jarkiholi family, is the lone contestant from Gokak. Deputy Speaker Vishwanath Mamani, Mr. Ramesh Katti, Rajendra Ankalagi and Mr. Savadi are the other important candidates. In the joint press conference, the BJP leaders said that they were all united and believed that all were equal in the party. They vowed to stay united for the next 20 years and work for the district and its poor.

They said that they planned to invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inaugurate the bank’s new building in a few months.

Balachandra Jarkiholi, who is also KMF chairman and who did most of the talking, said that Karnataka was set to witness a cooperative revolution and that it was about to begin from Belagavi.

The former Minister Umesh Katti said that the bank had saved funds in the estimated cost for construction as it completed work earlier than expected.

Rajya Sabha member Eeranna Kadadi, MLC Mahantesh Kavatagimath, Mr. Savadi, Minister for Women and Child Welfare Shashikala Jolle, Mr. Jolle, Mr. Mamani, MLA and director Mahantesh Dodagoudar and other leaders were present in the press conference.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qlayjt/article32975407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGBELAGAVIDCCBANK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/19-candidates-file-nomination-papers-for-dcc-bank-polls/article32975408.ece
139,2020/10/29,"Accused collapses in front of court building in Kushtagi, dies","Police say that she may have consumed poison before coming for hearing

Ganga Kulkarni, one of the accused in the cheating case filed by film lyricist K. Kalyan, was found dead in Kushtagi of Koppal district on Thursday.

She was meeting some lawyers in the local court in relation to a case where she was accused of collecting money from unemployed youth in Koppal district and outside.

The magistrate court in Kushtagi had issued an arrest warrant against Ganga Kulkarni, alias Jyoti, (50) on the charge of cheating unemployed youth and for not responding to several summons earlier. She was supposed to attend court in connection with this case on November 3. She had come to meet her lawyers to prepare for the hearing.

But she collapsed in front of the court building and the police and lawyers rushed her to a hospital. Doctors tried to treat her, but she died in a few minutes. The police suspected that she had consumed poison before coming to court.

The case in Kushtagi was one among the many that she was facing.

Meanwhile, Kushtagi Police have registered a case of suicide.

The woman, who hailed from Bagalkot, was wanted by the police in four districts.

Mr. Kalyan, whose wife hails from Belagavi, had accused self-styled astrologer Shivanand Wali and his accomplice Ganga Kulkarni of swindling his family property after cheating his wife and in-laws. He said that Ganga Kulkarni had joined his house in Bengaluru as a cook and had gained the confidence of his family members. She had introduced Wali to them and told them that he could solve their problems. This led to Mr. Kalyan’s wife and her parents shifting back to Belagavi. Mr. Kalyan’s parents in-law transferred valuable property in Belagavi to the astrologer under undue influence and fraud, Mr. Kalyan said in his complaint to the police last month.

The police then arrested Wali. They formed a team to arrest Ganga Kulkarni.

Police Commissioner K. Thiyagarajan organised counselling for Ms. Kalyan at the city women’s helpline. The two families held a series of meetings to sort out their differences.

141,2020/10/29,COVID-19 test for tourists at Mysuru palace,"Swab tests are being done using RT-PCR and RATs; tests for visitors in other tourist sites will conducted soon

COVID-19 test may become compulsory for those wishing to visit the Mysuru palace even as the Department of Health and Family Welfare has deployed testing teams at the city’s popular tourist destination for subjecting visitors to the test using the RT-PCR and the Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) methods.

Though the test to all visitors is not mandatory as of now, it may become compulsory even as the department was insisting on the test to those having symptoms and tourists from other States.

Such tests may also be expanded to the visitors of other prominent tourist destinations in the city, including the zoo, soon as a measure to bring the pandemic under control.

Mysuru District Vector Borne Diseases Control Officer Chidambar said nearly 200-300 tests were being conducted for the visitors at the palace since the last four days. All visitors are being screened and anybody with COVID-19 like symptoms are told to undergo the test if they wish to visit the palace.

“We are persuading even travellers from other States to take the test as a precaution to contain the spread and keep the possibilities of a second wave of infection at bay.”

Initially, the RATs were conducted. Now RT-PCR swab test had also been started, as it was a confirmatory test. In the case of PCR, the details of tourists such as phone numbers and the addresses are collected since the PCR result would take at least 48 hours.

Dr. Chidambar said more testing teams would be deployed at the sites for faster swab collection and testing. The system of mass testing will also be expanded to the industries in Mysuru shortly.

To a question, Dr. Chidambar said some positive cases, including visitors from other States, were detected during the free testing at the palace, and steps were taken to ensure that the infection does not spread from such persons.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-test-for-tourists-at-palace/article32975008.ece

In a short notice “public auction” conducted at the landmark Kittur Chennamma Circle in Hubballi on Thursday, Members of Parliament from the State were auctioned at prices as low as ₹ 1 to a maximum of ₹ 5.

The “public action” was arranged by Kannada activist and founder of Kannada Chalavali Vatal Paksha Vatal Nagaraj in protest against the apathy of the Members of Parliament from the State towards the sufferings of the flood displaced and affected people of North Karnataka and also the development of the region.

The “auction” call for Rajya Sabha member from Karnataka and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman began at ₹ 1 and a person by name N.H. Patil made a successful bid at ₹ 5. Similarly, Member of Parliament from Koppal Karadi Sanganna was “auctioned” for a successful bid of ₹ 1 made by a boy.

However, the others, including Union Ministers Pralhad Joshi and D.V. Sadananda Gowda, MPs G.M. Siddeshwar, Ananthkumar Hegde, Tejasvi Surya and B.Y. Raghavendra, remained “unsold” as no bidders came forward to buy them.

Earlier, addressing presspersons before the “auction”, Mr. Vatal Nagaraj said that the protest was aimed at reminding the Members of Parliament about their duties which they had forgotten.

Although the northern districts of the State had frequently experienced downpour and floods, the MPs from Karnataka had failed to impress upon the Union government to release the requisite funds for relief. “Such has been the apathy of the Union government and the Prime Minister towards the plight of the people of North Karnataka that none of the top leaders from the Centre thought it right to visit the flood-affected areas in the State,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/e3eyfn/article32979135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30HBVATAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/two-mps-sold-in-public-auction-others-see-no-takers/article32974298.ece

144,2020/10/29,Chaos marks Hassan CMC poll,"JD(S) raises objections, result not announced as per court order

The election for the post of Hassan City Municipal Council president was held on Thursday amidst heated arguments among political parties. The election procedure for the president’s post was completed. However, the Returning Officer did not announce the result as per the court’s order. The election to the vice-president’s post was mired in chaos and confusion as the JD(S) leaders sought more time to file nomination papers.

In the council of 35 members, the president’s post was reserved for Scheduled Tribe category. The only member who suits the category, Mohan Kumar, elected on the BJP ticket from ward 34, filed the nomination papers. The JD(S), despite winning 17 seats in the council, could not get a chance to file the papers for the president’s post. The party has moved the court challenging the reservation. The court had ordered to hold the election as per schedule but restricted the administration from declaring the results until the petition is disposed of by the High Court. B.A. Jagadish, Assistant Commissioner of Hassan sub-division, who acted as Returning Officer, accepted the nomination papers but did not announce the winner.

However, chaos prevailed in connection with the election for the post of vice-president, which was reserved for the BCA Woman category. Mangala Pradeep of the BJP had filed the nomination papers; none from the JD(S) or the Congress had done so. Members of the JD(S) argued that there was ambiguity concerning the deadline for filing the nomination papers and sought more time. However, the BJP leaders including Preetham Gowda, MLA, urged the Returning Officer to complete the election process. Later, the RO announced that the election for the vice-president’s post would be held on Friday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/chaos-marks-hassan-cmc-poll/article32974110.ece
145,2020/10/29,Mysuru’s active cases drop by over 50% in ten days,"From 7,246 active cases when Dasara began, the number fell to 2,073 by the time the festivities concluded

Even as the Dasara fete passed off successfully, the number of active cases in Mysuru has dropped by over 50 per cent in a span of about 10 days.

Also, the cumulative recoveries as on Wednesday were nearing the 45,000-mark, thanks to remarkable improvement in the discharges of patients since early this month.

As on Wednesday, Mysuru has 2,073 active cases which is over 50 per cent less when compared to the number of active cases about 10 days ago. There were nearly 6,000 active cases until October 20.

When Mysuru was gearing up for the festivities early this month, there were a lot of apprehensions on whether the celebrations, though on a low-key, would spike the cases with tourists thronging the city. The anxiety also led to the visit of COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee from Bengaluru and advisories to the Mysuru district administration on dealing with the pandemic through the celebrations.

Since the start of the festivities and the conclusion, the cases did not spike like they did last month, much to the relief of the authorities even though most events had been cancelled as a precautionary measure besides restricting public entry to the venues.

Prior to the celebrations, Minister for Health and Medical Education K. Sudhakar visited Mysuru twice to assess the COVID-19 situation and issue directions for keeping the pandemic under control. Accordingly, some steps were initiated, including the ramping up of tests, doorstep testing, and active contact tracing besides carrying out a death audit of all the fatalities since the outbreak to ascertain the reasons for the spurt in deaths here.

The active cases on day one of Dasara on October 17 stood at 7,246. On that day, 501 positive cases had been reported along with 10 deaths.

A day later, Mysuru reported one death with 404 new infections. The cases, however, dropped with 151 new infections on day three with four new deaths. But, there were 451 new cases on day four besides two new deaths. On day four, October 20, the active cases were 5,976. In 10 days from thereon, the active cases have dropped by over 50 per cent with the sliding of the positivity rate (PR) and the case fatality rate (CFR)

After the authorities managed to get a grip on the pandemic, Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, a week ago, said that all parameters were showing improvement with the case fatality rate down from 2.1 per cent to 1.1 per cent since early this month with the rise in testing from 2,000 to nearly 4,000 a day.

She, however, cautioned against being inattentive to the precautions over the fall in new infections, saying that Mysuru was still not COVID-19 free and advised the people to continue taking all precautions until the pandemic was brought under full control.

The data released by the COVID-19 War Room recently showed the number of persons testing positive was also on the decline with the positivity rate falling to 7.8 per cent from 9.0 per cent in a span of two weeks.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysurus-active-cases-drop-by-over-50-in-ten-days/article32974018.ece

147,2020/10/29,Bengaluru drug case | ED officials arrest CPI (M) leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s son Bineesh,"He faces money laundering case.

Enforcement Directorate officials on Thursday arrested Bineesh Kodiyeri, son of Kerala CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, for his alleged financial links to a businessman, Mohammed Anoop, who had been arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau in Bengaluru in connection with a drug racket in August. Bineesh, who appeared before the ED officials, was subjected to three hours of intense questioning before he was arrested. He was produced before the court and taken into four days custody for further investigation.

Mohammed Anoop, in his statement to the ED, which has been probing the finances of the arrested peddlers, had said Bineesh had lent him ₹50 lakh to start a business in Bengaluru. This prompted ED officials to summon him for questioning.

Incidentally, Bineesh told ED officials that he in turn had borrowed the money from a friend to help Anoop, said ED sources.

“We asked him to substantiate his claims about the money and gave him time, but he failed to do so,” said an ED official. The Enforcement Directorate has booked a case against Bineesh under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

The ED probe stems from a case being investigated by the Narcotics Control Bureau that claimed to have busted an ecstasy pills drug trafficking racket in Karnataka in August.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ko58i4/article32971964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BINEESHKODIYERI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bengaluru-drug-case-ed-summons-bineesh-kodiyeri-again/article32971965.ece
148,2020/10/29,KMF on the path to recovery,"We should build on our gains, says Balachandra Jarkiholi

Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), which suffered huge losses during the COVID-19-induced lockdown, is on the path to recovery.

There is an irony in the process of recovery though. Senior officials say that the lockdown that nearly shut down several dairies and processing plants in different States has created opportunities for the country’s second largest dairy cooperative.

A senior officer told The Hindu that KMF had sold over 2,150 tonnes of milk powder to Bihar and around 1,100 tonnes of butter to the same State and also others.

“We are selling 3.5 lakh litres of milk per day to other States. This includes sales to other milk federations and the counter sales of Nandini outlets in other States. We are focusing on increasing the range and quantum of our products sold,” the officer said.

‘Temporary’

KMF chairman Balachandra Jarkiholi said that the recovery is temporary and the organisation has to build on its gains to make sure it stays ahead of competition.

“It is pretty much as if we were the last shop that is open after a storm, that people rush to buy essentials. But we can not depend on that. We need to strengthen our position and move forward to consolidate the gains,” he said.

“We have sold over 120 tonnes of sweets in the Navaratri season alone and we plan to sell more,” he said. “Federations in other States have approached us with offers to buy our milk and milk products. We are putting in place a system to quicken out-of-State sales,” he added. “However, there is still a long way to to go. We sell only around half of our daily procurement of 80 lakh litres of milk, everyday. We have 12.6 tonnes of butter and 27.5 tonnes of milk powder in stock. Our capacity to convert all unsold milk into products with longer shelf life needs to be scaled up. For this, we need investment. We are constituting a group to study this and suggest measures,” he said.

Sales plans

KMF also plans to increase the number of sales outlets — Nandini parlours and Nandini shoppee — across the State and outside.

“We now have 1,462 Nandini parlours and 220 shoppees. We plans to open more, in the franchise model, and to explore new markets,” he said.

He said that KMF is the only major dairy technology agency in the State that buys high and sells low.

Highest price

“We give the highest price to farmers, but sell our products at the least possible price to consumers. As we are a cooperative, our operating costs are very low. However, we are managing it efficiently. Despite our losses, we were able to donate ₹ 8 crore to the Chief Minister’s Relief fund,” he said.

Mr. Balachandra Jarkiholi observed that of the 80 lakh litres of milk collected everyday by the federation, only around 10 lakh litres comes from the 14 North Karnataka districts.

He said that KMF will take up an awareness and education campaign for farmers in North Karnataka to increase their contribution to KMF procurement.

Started in 1974, KMF is the largest dairy cooperative in the country after AMUL. It has 14 unions covering all the districts in the State. Its procurement more than doubled after the State government began paying incentive to farmers for every litre of milk sent to KMF in 2008.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bwoejb/article32967516.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGBELAGAVIKMF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kmf-on-the-path-to-recovery/article32967517.ece

Confusion

Mr. Shettar even raised the issue with Assistant Returning Officer and Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil. However, it later turned out that the additional list being carried by the party workers was not an updated one.

Mr. Nitesh Patil told The Hindu that they had supplied the updated voter list to all polling stations and it was given to candidates also. However, it turned out that some carried an old additional list creating confusion among voters. “We have cleared confusion,” he said.

156,2020/10/29,Study finds access to electricity almost 100% in State,"BESCOM scores a high access index score

Karnataka is the only State, among the 10 that were surveyed, where access to electricity is almost 100%, and the differences in the five distribution companies’ access rate across customer categories is not statistically significant.

This is one of the findings of the ‘Electricity access and benchmarking of distribution utilities’, a joint study by Smart Power India, NITI Aayog and the Rockefeller Foundation. The study was conducted across 10 States, 25 utilities, over 25,000 respondents from different consumer categories, such as households, agriculture, commercial enterprises, and institutions from both urban and rural areas.

The study has brought out findings on grid connectivity, electricity access, customer satisfaction, and the state of the utilities’ capacity to deliver. The Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (BESCOM) has scored a high access index score, while the other four utilities in the State — the Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Company (CESC), the Hubli Electricity Supply Company (HESCOM), the Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company(GESCOM), and the Mangalore Electricity Supply Company (MESCOM) — have been given a medium scoring.

Customer satisfaction is often considered the goal of a service-driven industry. The study took into consideration customer satisfaction on six parameters – providing a new connection, power reliability, power quality, billing and collection process, complaint resolution process, and service provided. Interestingly, in this category, BESCOM and MESCOM were rated high, while CESC, HESCOM, and GESCOM got a medium rating.

With regard to the utilities’ capacity to deliver electricity access sustainably, all five utilities received a medium rating. The study has found that among the 25 utilities, CESC is among the three to have the lowest average number of hours of supply each day for agricultural customers at 6.7 hours. The other two are Gujarat South and Punjab. For all other utilities, the hours of supply to agricultural customers varies from eight to 21 hours.

While citizens here may complain about numerous unscheduled power cuts, the study has found that less than 10% of customers of CESC, MESCOM, and GESCOM claimed to have been notified by the utility, while it was nearly 20% for HESCOM and BESCOM.

With regard to affordability, cost as percentage of household expenditure, the study found that BESCOM was the least affordable, with around half of all household customers reporting unaffordable access.

Though all 25 utlities were observed to have performed well on providing metered connection for the majority of customers across all categories, GESCOM was among the three with the lowest percentage of customers with a metered connection.

According to the study, 100% of BESCOM and CESC customers reported a fixed billing frequency, while it was nearly 100% in MESCOM and HESCOM, and between 90% and 100% for GESCOM.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jj94es/article32967221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGOctBESCOMcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/study-finds-access-to-electricity-almost-100-in-state/article32967222.ece
157,2020/10/29,Unbridled promotion of ecotourism fraught with danger to wildlife,"The Forest Department’s volte-face on creating a new tourism zone with safari facilities at the Nugu Wildlife Sanctuary has brought into focus the negative fallout of unbridled promotion of ecotourism around Bandipur.

The authorities wanted to create a tourism zone at Nugu but the proposal was “put on hold” as both legal and wildlife-related issues were raised.

One of the ostensible objectives for the new zone was to reduce pressure on the Bandipur core area and get tourists towards Nugu, which is in the buffer zone. But it was argued that instead of reducing pressure the proposed move would open the floodgates and even Nugu would be saturated with tourists.

Two national highways [NH 766 and NH 67] cut through the Bandipur tiger reserve and, hence, it is accessible from Mysuru, Ooty, and Wayanad, three popular tourist destinations.

Dormitories and cottages, which can accommodate about 80 to 100 people, are always full. But the people for daily safaris [from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 3.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.] tend to be more.

During the peak season and weekends, hundreds of tourists drive down as walk-in customers preferring only a safari ride, and the footfall surpasses the carrying capacity of the tiger reserve. Wildlife activists have said it is not about the safari alone but the long-term consequences of such activities that have a bearing on the wildlife habitat, which is discomforting.

Given Bandipur’s popularity, the vehicle density on the two highways cutting through the tiger reserve is already an area of concern. It has led to road kills forcing the district administration to notify a ban on night traffic through the forest.

“This apart, there is a proliferation of private resorts and homestays – especially in and around Mangala, Elchetti, Chikka Elchetti, Hangala Hosahalli, Melukamanahalli, and Maguvinahalli villages and some of them are illegal,” according to the activists.

It was only recently that the Chamarajanagar district administration ordered a crackdown on homestays around Bandipur.

The department had identified 14 properties constructed in violation of eco-sensitive zone guidelines and wanted their closure.

Some of the properties are in the wildlife corridor area and could impede their movement, according to activists keen to get the homestays shut down. But the matter is now before the court.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/c7rnl/article32967201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGADADA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/unbridled-promotion-of-ecotourism-fraught-with-danger-to-wildlife/article32967202.ece
158,2020/10/29,Sigandur temple row now takes a caste turn,"Shivamogga DC’s order on appointing committees fuels resentment

The Shivamogga Deputy Commissioner’s order appointing committees to look after the administration of Sigandur Chowdeshwari Temple has not gone down well with leaders of the Arya Idiga community and the Brahma Shree Narayanaguru Dharma Paripalana Parishat (BSNDP), an organisation of the Idiga/Billava communities.

With this, the controversy that began with differences between trustees of the temple and the priest has taken a caste turn.

Leaders of the Arya Idiga community have come out openly in support of S. Ramappa, a trustee.

The BSNDP had earlier given a call for a Sigandur Chalo with a demand to remove Sheshagiri Bhat, the priest. The protest rally, earlier scheduled for October 29, has been postponed.

The differences between the trustees and the priest hit the headlines when the temples were ready to invite devotees back after the COVID-19 lockdown was relaxed.

There had been heated arguments between the two camps over the temple responsibilities. While the priest’s camp alleged that the trustees were not allowing them to perform their duties on the temple premises, the trustees’ faction defended that they were following strict COVID-19 guidelines.

The incidents took an ugly turn when a person, said to be a supporter of Mr. Ramappa, was assaulted on the premises by a brother of Mr. Bhat on October 16.

Following the instruction from the Chief Minister, Shivamogga DC K.B. Shivakumar visited the temple and on October 23 issued an order constituting two committees.

The constitution of committees has been viewed by the Idiga/Billava community as an attempt by the government to take over the temple belonged to their community.

Kattigehalla Raghupathi, leader of the community, in a press conference in Shivamogga, recently said that the DC had constituted the committees without hearing the trustees. The office-bearers of BSNDP also held a press conference and said that the organisation would oppose any attempt by the government to take over the temple.

Chief Minister B.S.Yediyurappa during his visit to Shivamogga earlier this week said the government constituted committees only to avoid the mismanagement of funds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sigandur-temple-row-now-takes-a-caste-turn/article32967190.ece

160,2020/10/29,Probe leading to CM: Chennithala,"CPI(M) State secretary too in predicament, says Leader of the Opposition

Opposition Leader Ramesh Chennithala on Thursday demanded the resignation of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the wake of the Enforcement Directorate arresting M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister , as the fifth accused in the gold smuggling case.

Speaking to reporters here on Thursday, Mr. Chennithala said the probe would lead to the Chief Minister and he would turn as the main accused.

Mr. Vijayan was in the dock with the arrest of Sivasankar. He was not legally and morally qualified to continue in the post any more and should resign to respect public sentiments, he opined.

Mr. Chennithala accused the Chief Minister of protecting Mr. Sivasankar from the very beginning. That was why he had not shifted the official out even after CPI leader Kanam Rajendran asked for it, he observed.

The Chief Minister was aware of all the transactions of Sivsankar, he said.

The Chief Minister, who initially denied knowing Swapna, accused in the gold smuggling case, later admitted meeting her after she confirmed meeting him six times. The Opposition Leader alleged that the CCTV footage was destroyed to wipe out such evidence.

CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, who should question the Chief Minister on the issue, was in a predicament with his son Binish Kodiyeri being arrested by the ED in Bengaluru.

162,2020/10/29,Farmfrnd to help farmers get a better deal,"Mobile app will connect Kottayam farmers to local shopkeepers and buyers

As farming technologies continue to evolve at a rapid pace, markets for agricultural produce too are fast migrating to online platforms.

Farmfrnd, a mobile application launched by the K.R. Narayanan Foundation in Kottayam, is the latest to join the ever-increasing list of technology-enabled solutions to help farmers sell their produce directly to customers. The app seeks to network the farmers with the local shopkeepers and the end-customers by avoiding the middlemen, who typically hinder fair trading .

Launched by Pala MLA Mani C. Kappan, the mobile app was created in connection with the centenary birth year celebrations of K.R. Narayanan, former President of India.

The app can be downloaded for free from Google Play Store for Android phones. “We are working on other platforms too, which will be available soon,” said Thommen Jose, a Corporate filmmaker who developed the app with a tech-team in Kochi.

Hailing from Pala, a predominantly agrarian economy, Mr. Jose had been witness to the difficulties experienced by local farmers in connecting with their markets during the lockdown. He decided to come up with a technology-enabled solution to help the farmers.

Expansion plans

According to Eby J. Jose, chairman of the K.R. Narayanan Foundation, the service of the mobile app will be limited to the registered users in Kottayam district in the first phase while plans are afoot to expand the scope of its operation to more areas. The app enables the farmers to list their produce along with phone number while for buyers, it gives a view of available produce, sorted by their geographical proximity to the farmers.

Meanwhile, the makers of the app are also exploring options to augment the service by providing the current prices of commodities in trade, demand for listed products, and weather and seasonal changes, to help farmers plan better.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/farmfrnd-to-help-farmers-get-a-better-deal/article32976353.ece

The ecologically sensitive Pathiramanal island in Vembanad Lake has become the first local biodiversity heritage site (LBHS) in the district.

A declaration in this regard was made by the biodiversity management committee (BMC) attached to the Muhamma grama panchayat recently. As per a decision of the BMC, the district unit of the Kerala State Biodiversity Board (KSBB) had conducted a biodiversity study of the island. The KSBB recently approved a report, which recommended Pathiramanal island heritage site status.

As per the report prepared by Jose Mathew and Sandeep Unnikrishnan, both members of the district-level technical support group of the KSBB, the island is home to a large number of mangroves belonging to four species.

There are 160 types of flowering plants and nine types of ferns. Of them, 52 types are trees. There are 21 species of shrubs, 72 small plants, 13 creeper plant species and so on. Besides, 106 types of butterflies, 89 bird species, 18 types of dragonflies, 18 amphibians, 12 types of reptiles, and five mammal species are also found on the island. In the waters surrounding the island, fishes, prawns, clams are among the 120 aquatic species found during the study.

J. Jayalal, president, Muhamma grama panchayat, said the island would be made a biodiversity study centre. “Muhamma is the first local body in the district to declare an LBHS for the protection of biodiversity. We will plant more mangroves, medicinal among other plants at Pathiramanal,” Mr. Jayalal said.

K.V. Dayal, environmentalist and convener of the BMC, said a portion of the island would be converted into a bird sanctuary.

KSBB district coordinator T.G. Chandraprakash urged other local bodies in the district to follow suit. “BMCs attached to local bodies can declare biodiversity-rich sacred groves, mangrove forests, wetlands and so on within in their limits as local biodiversity heritage sites,” he said.

Apart from being biodiversity-rich, Pathiramanal is also a popular tourist destination.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qyv6ma/article32976331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30tval1-Pathiramanal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pathiramanal-gets-a-green-acclaim/article32976326.ece
164,2020/10/29,Donna is a winner,"Police dog wins gold medal in efficiency test

Donna has finally got the recognition it deserved. A police dog that worked hard to find victims of the Pettimudy landslip, it has bagged the gold medal at the service efficiency test conducted at the Kerala Police Academy, Thrissur.

Donna, a Labrador Retriever, got the gold medal as part of the assessment test before the passing-out parade at the State dog training institute of the Kerala Police Academy.

Donna was an integral part of the rescue team at Pettimudy, near Munnar, where four estate lanes were buried under debris of the landslip on the fateful day on August 7. As many as 66 bodies were recovered in rescue operations which lasted a month.

Police officers said Donna worked tirelessly with rescuers to recover bodies before formally completing dog squad training.

“Donna was deputed for search and rescue operations for the first time. It has now completed training. Dogs deployed for search and rescue operations will be capable of finding the pulse of life in a landslip or similar casualties and are essential in an emergency situation,” Idukki dog squad in-charge Roy Thomas said.

Donna was included in the district dog squad in view of the chances of similar incidents in future. Along with Donna, Dolly (sniffer) also completed training and joined the dog squad at Idukki.

Idukki Superintendent of Police R. Karuppusami gave a reception to the two members. He also lauded trainers of the squad.

The other members in the dog squad included Geni, Esthor (tracker), Chandu (sniffer), and Laika and Neeli (narcotic).",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pjn2dr/article32976292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30tvdona,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/donna-is-a-winner/article32976290.ece
165,2020/10/29,SC panel for financial autonomy to KRSA,"Exchequer owes ₹716.84 cr. as arrears to KRSA

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM The Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety has asked Kerala to ensure financial autonomy to the Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA) and release funds due to it from 2015 as per the Kerala Road Safety Authority Act.

The three-member committee headed by Justice Abhay Manohar Sapre also asked the State to set up a non-lapsable road safety fund under the Act provisions.

The State will also have to open a PLA (Personal Ledger Account) bank account in the name of the authority and frame rules and regulations with provisions to transfer funds to the account and administration thereof.

Road safety activities have been lagging behind as the exchequer owes ₹716.84 crore as arrears to the KRSA. The arrears comprise 50% of the compounding fee collected under Section 200 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the one-time cess collected from all classes of motor vehicles. A one-time cess of ₹250 will have to be paid for heavy motor vehicles, medium vehicles ₹150, light vehicles ₹100, and two-wheelers ₹50.

From 2008, when the authority was constituted, to 2015 the government has contributed only ₹172 crore to the Kerala Road Safety Fund (KRSF) against the ₹552 crore due, resulting in arrears of ₹380 crore. From 2015 to 2019, the government had not paid even a single rupee to the KRSF. In 2019-20, ₹4 crore was provided. Thus, the arrears from the exchequer to the KRSF is ₹716.84 crore.

The committee issued the directive after reviewing road safety, accident statistics, and functioning of the KRSA with officials of the Transport Department and the KRSA.

The KRSA has been asked to prescribe standards of road safety for compliance with by the stakeholder department agencies and delegate powers, as it deems fit, to officers holding statutory provisions under the KRSA Act.

On the road safety front, the panel observed that the government and the KRSA should have done more to reduce fatalities. “Except the 3.6% reduction in 2017 and the lockdown effect in 2020, there was a consistent increase in fatalities in the State from 2014 to 2019 resulting in an overall increase of 10% during the five-year period,” the Chairman noted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sc-panel-for-financial-autonomy-to-krsa/article32976286.ece

Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Ramesh Chennithala has accused Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders of running an underworld in the State.

“The arrests of M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister, and Bineesh Kodiyeri, son of CPI(M) State secretary, in two separate cases, revealed the organised syndicate of that party functioning in the State,” he said at a news conference here on Thursday.

The State secretary and the Chief Minister were heading the underworld activities. Such incidents were an insult to people, Mr. Chennithala said.

Demanding the resignation of the Chief Minister, Mr. Chennithala said that cases of gold smuggling through diplomatic channel in Kerala and the drug racket of Bengaluru had close links. “All the culprits in the case should be brought to book. More persons attached to the Chief Minister’s office will be questioned shortly,” he said. Replying to questions on the statement of Mr. Balakrishnan that the CPI (M) had nothing to do with the drug case, Mr. Chennithala wondered why only Mr. Bineesh was continuously involved in criminal cases unlike the children of other CPI(M) leaders.

169,2020/10/29,Chennithala glorifying Central agencies: CM,"‘But Sonia opposes their partisan conduct’

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday said Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala lionised and feted Central law enforcement agencies functioning in Kerala.

At the same time, Congress president Sonia Gandhi portrayed them as political tools of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government.

Mr. Chennithala glorified federal law enforcement as politically non-partisan and objective. In contrast, Ms. Gandhi said they were instruments in the hands of the Centre to unsettle non-BJP ruled States, hound political opponents and discredit Opposition activists in general.

The country’s history was dotted with examples of successive Central governments using federal law enforcement for political purposes. “I am not venturing further into the topic. The government is still of the opinion that the multiple investigations into the gold smuggling case were no the right track,” the Chief Minister said. But, Mr. Chennithala should explain why he extolled the Central agencies functioning in Kerala.

The State had challenged the CBI’s decision to investigate Life Mission officials on the charge of violating Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act because it received a legal opinion that the agency had overstepped its jurisdictional bounds.

The Congress and the BJP had attempted to lay down a smokescreen of lies to eclipse the track record of the LDF government and put it on the defence ahead of the local body polls. They had tried to kick up a stink by spreading conspiracy theories about the government’s link with gold smugglers.

The IUML should realise that Kerala was the only State that accorded backward class reservation for Muslims.

The Lok Sabha had passed the Constitution (124th Amendment) Bill, 2019, with an overwhelming majority to succour the poor among forward castes without diminishing the existing 50% quota for SC/ST and backward class communities.

The LDF government would ensure that nobody misused the new reservation policy to rob the backward classes and SC/ST communities of their due.

Madin Academy chairman Sayed Ibrahim Khaleel Bukhari led the celebrations that began on Wednesday evening and concluded on Thursday morning. The organisers said a number of people from different continents took part in the programmes.

172,2020/10/29,Seat-sharing talks gather momentum,"Stakes are high for both UDF and LDF this time in Kottayam

With the notification for the local body elections expected soon, seat-sharing talks among major political coalitions have gathered momentum in Kottayam.

Coming hot on the heels of a much-discussed political realignment of the Kerala Congress(M) led by Jose K. Mani, the stakes are high for both the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) this time.

The National Development Alliance (NDA), meanwhile, is in trouble with the prospective exit of the Kerala Congress led by P.C. Thomas, which seeks to align with the UDF.

While discussions on sharing of seats in local and civic bodies have entered the final stages, discussions on the block and district panchayats are set to commence in a couple of days after a formal meeting of the respective district-level committees of the three coalitions.

With the Mani group in its its fold, the LDF counts on making major inroads into Christian vote base of the rubber heartland in this election. The entry of the new constituent, however, has not come without troubles as the CPI and NCP, two other constituent parties, are reported to have expressed reluctance to forgo their share of seats for the KC(M).

Adding to the confusion, the KC(M) has also expressed its desire to maintain all the seats they contested in the previous election.

According to V.N. Vasavan, the CPI(M) district secretary, all issues with regard to seats would be settled amicably. “The LDF will be convening a meeting of its district committee on Saturday to kick start discussions on the seat-sharing formula at different levels,” he said.

The UDF, on the other hand, is slated to hold a meeting of its district committee to be attended by AICC general secretary Oommen Chandy, Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan and K.C. Joseph on November 2. As the P.J. Joseph faction of the KC(M) has already demanded the UDF leadership to maintain status quo of the previous local body election with regard to seat sharing, discussions in the UDF is expected to become a stormy affair this time.

“The proportion of seats to different constituents at the block panchayats and municipalities will be decided at the district level, while subcommittees have been formed at different panchayats for the purpose,” said Joshy Philip, president, District Congress Committee.

The NDA, meanwhile, has already completed two rounds of discussions and is planning to wind up the same by November first week. “Talks at the panchayat level are progressing and are slated to be complete by October 30. The talks will be wound up with a meeting of the NDA district committee on November 2,’’ said a senior BJP leader.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/seat-sharing-talks-gather-momentum/article32974334.ece

Coming up on the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS), Ambalavayal campus, with technical hand-holding under the Indo-Dutch Joint Action Plan, the centre is expected to turn full-fledged over the next one year, Agriculture Department officials said.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will formally inaugurate the centre at a virtual conclave on November 5. Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar and senior functionaries of the Government of the Netherlands will attend the function.

Envisaged under the State Horticulture Mission (SHM), the centre is being established at a cost of ₹13 crore, of which ₹4.2 crore will come as central share. In the first phase, open-field precision farming of vegetables and flowers, production and distribution of quality planting materials to farmers and training programmes are planned, department officials said.

Considering the special climatic conditions of Wayanad, there will be special focus on capsicum, tomato and cucumber and flowers such as chrysanthemum and gerbera.

Calling the centre a dream project for the State, Agriculture Minister V. S. Sunil Kumar said the State government expects to tap the expertise of the Netherlands in vegetable and flower cultivation for the benefit of farmers in Kerala.

“'A tissue culture laboratory has been set up as part of the project for producing good quality planting materials. The idea is to transform Wayanad into a hub of floriculture,” Mr. Sunil Kumar told The Hindu.

The centre will have five Netherlands-model polyhouse nurseries and four Indian model polyhouses for large-scale production of flowers and distribution of quality seeds and transplants to farmers. Other infrastructure includes model open-field farms and a post-harvest technology centre showcasing post-harvest handling, storage and marketing of produce for the benefit of farmers.

Further, the Centre will offer regular training programmes for farmers, entrepreneurs and extension officers, and also explore possibilities in agri-horti tourism in Wayanad district.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/floriculture-centre-to-be-opened-inwayanad/article32974323.ece

Senior party leaders are struggling to take a concrete stance on the issue which many believe is a googly thrown by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) -led Left government during the fag end of its term. The predicament of the party is visible when leaders have been airing multiple views on different occasions.

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran says his party favoured an amendment to provide quota to the deprived sections of the forward communities, but wanted the State government to wait till the Supreme Court gave a verdict on it.

Even while blaming the government for trying to drive a wedge between different communities, the Congress leadership has left the matter to be decided by its political affairs committee. At the same time, it has been trying to placate its main ally, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), which has been opposing the new quota policy.

Trapped by two contradictory conditions, the leadership feared losing traditional votes of Hindu Nair community and Syrian Catholics, which have been rooting for reservations for EWS categories. Already the Syro Malabar Church has flayed the ambiguous stand of the Congress- led United Democratic Front (UDF).

An analysis of the previous polls showed that the Congress has been losing a section of voters especially the Nair community even when the State has been witnessing a trend of alternating governments. One of the reasons is the emergence of the BJP in the State's polity.

The shift in the social base of parties was witnessed in the previous Assembly polls of 2016 with LDF garnering more votes of the Nair and Ezhava communities. Incidentally BJP came second in getting the votes of the Nair community in the three-way split of their votes.

Likewise the Christian and Muslim communities, the traditional vote base of the UDF, have also been shifting their voting preferences to the LDF. However, these trends were completely reversed in the Lok Sabha polls of 2019 when the UDF won 19 out of the 20 seats.

Nevertheless it remains to be seen how the voting pattern of the Ezhava community turns out, which more often backed the LDF in the Assembly or Lok Sabha polls, in the wake of the proposed EWS reservation.

The Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam has termed the proposal as politically motivated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/congress-in-a-catch-22-situation/article32973909.ece
176,2020/10/29,Brahmana sabha for quota-free society,"The Kerala Brahmana Sabha (KBS) said here on Thursday that it stood for a reservation-free society where all sections enjoyed equal opportunities and status.

In a statement issued here, KBS general secretary N.V. Sivarama Krishnan and president Karimpuzha Raman said that the concept of reservation should be changed if the country wanted a robust society.

Welcoming the State and Central government decisions on reservation for forward communities, KBS leaders said that they did not favour the idea of 10 per cent reservation in the 50 per cent general category.

“Education and job on the basis of reservation is denial of justice for all. Freedom and equality assured in the Constitution is thus denied to people who are born in forward communities,” they said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/brahmana-sabha-for-quota-free-society/article32973715.ece
177,2020/10/29,No Ayush cure for COVID-19,"State govt. bars Ayush doctors from advertising and prescribing drugs for COVID-19

The State government has barred qualified Ayush doctors from placing advertisements and prescribing drugs to cure COVID-19. This is, however, not applicable to the medicines suggested as ‘immunity boosters’ by the Union government.

In an order on October 20, the Secretary, Ayush, said that the direction was in line with the judgment of the Kerala High Court, which said on August 21 that Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy medicines can be used only as immunity boosters and that they cannot be prescribed as a cure for the infection.

The court order was based on a petition which claimed that the State government was not allowing homoeopathy and other AYUSH branches of medicine to be used in the battle against the pandemic. The protocol here allows only government or those authorised by the government to treat the infected persons, their contacts, or those under quarantine.

The Union AYUSH Ministry has suggested consumption of Chyavanprash, herbal tea / decoction (kadha) made from tulsi (basil leaves), dalchini (cinnamon), kalimirch (black pepper), shunthi (dry ginger) and munakka (raisin) apart from golden milk or half tea spoon turmeric powder in 150 ml hot milk as immunity boosters.

The State government here also allows Arsenicum Album 30C homoeopathic drug as a prophylactic or a preventive drug, which has been opposed by doctors practising modern medicine and the associations representing them.

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja incurred the wrath of the Indian Medical Association when she purportedly endorsed the above homeopathic drug as an effective option against COVID-19. The Minister later clarified that she was only referring to a study by a District Medical Officer (Homoeopathy).

Any violation of the AYUSH secretary’s order would invite action under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The Health Department and the police have been directed to monitor the activities of Ayush practitioners, the order adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-ayush-cure-for-covid-19/article32973646.ece

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has said that the government has given shape to a ₹60,000-crore stimulus package to fight the economic downturn that has affected the State amid the pandemic.

Inaugurating the ‘Meet the Scholar’ lecture series organised by the University of Kerala on Wednesday, Dr. Isaac said that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a severe impact on the State’s economy and has affected several key sectors including tourism. The manufacturing sector has also witnessed immense loss during a short period.

The burgeoning unemployment coupled with the worrying rate of job loss among non-resident Keralites (NoRKs) have compounded the crisis. “The proposed stimulus package will be implemented through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The government has adopted steps to ensure that financial assistance reached the lower strata of the society directly,” he said.

Dr. Isaac’s lecture on ‘COVID-19 and the Kerala Economy’ marked the launch of the 52-week lecture series that will feature scholars, researchers, social reformers and pioneers in various fields interacting with teachers and students on contemporary issues. Each research department or centre will coordinate a lecture every week under the programme.

180,2020/10/29,Kerala gold smuggling case: Court grants ED 7-day custody of Sivasankar,"The senior Kerala bureaucrat was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday night

M. Sivasankar, who has been arraigned as the fifth accused in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act case booked by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), was given to the custody of the agency for seven days.

Though the agency sought 14 days custody, the Principal Sessions judge Kauser Edappagath allowed only seven days custody considering the fact that the accused was interrogated several times earlier.

The court asked the ED not to subject the accused to any sorts of harassment or torture and to permit him to contact his lawyer while in custody.

If the interrogation extends for three hours, there shall be a break of one hour. The interrogation shall be carried out between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. and the accused shall not be interrogated after 6 p.m. The accused shall also be allowed to the rest after 6 p.m., the court ordered.

The judge directed the investigating officer P. Radhakrishnan, the Assistant Director, of the agency, to ensure all medical assistance to the accused and to provide him Ayurvedic treatment for his back pain during custody without disturbing the interrogation process. If necessary, the accused can be taken to a doctor after 6 p.m., the court directed.

The investigating officer was directed to allow the accused to interact with his wife, brother and nephew while in custody without disturbing the interrogation process.

Earlier, Mr. Sivasankaran submitted to the court that he was taken into custody while undergoing medical treatment at Ayurvedic hospital, Thiruvananthapuram and he was suffering from acute disc prolapse. He also submitted that he required to continue the medial treatment.

He also submitted that he was unable to withstand the prolonged interrogation due to ill-health and he was continuity interrogated for hours together without any break and even during the night hours.

The court also directed the investigation officer to strictly comply with all the directions and guidelines issued by the Supreme Court and other mandate of law as well as the COVID protocol, while keeping the accused in custody.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/3dk8kq/article32684568.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sivasankarjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-gold-smuggling-case-court-grants-ed-7-days-custody-of-sivasankar/article32970561.ece
181,2020/10/29,Opposition turns the heat on Pinarayi,"Cong., BJP workers take to streets seeking CM’s resignation

A paroxysm of street protests demanding the resignation of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan swept across the State on Wednesday following the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) detention of his former Principal Secretary M. Sivasankar for questioning on money laundering charges related to the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case.

Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers spearheaded the protests primarily in front of the ED’s office in Kochi and the Secretariat here. However, its ripples were felt across the State in the form of local-level protests to spotlight Mr. Vijayan's alleged ‘proximity’ to Mr. Sivasankar.

Mr Sivasankar's detention has catalysed the Opposition's demand for Mr Vijayan's resignation. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the arrest of Mr. Sivasankar had done Mr. Vijayan’s bidding. The Chief Minister functioned behind an iron curtain. Even lawmakers and Ministers had no access to him. However, his office was open at all times for economic offenders, smugglers and traitors. Mr Vijayan had betrayed the public trust. Mr Vijayan should resign and face an enquiry, he said.

BJP leader N. Krishnadas said Mr. Vijayan had lost the moral right to continue in office.

The Left Democratic Front has rallied behind the Chief Minister. Communist Party of India (CPI) State secretary Kanam Rajendran said the government had removed Mr. Sivasankar from service on the charge of official misconduct. The government was not responsible for the private conduct of the officer.

Law Minister A. K. Balan said there was no ground or precedent for the Chief Minister to resign because a former bureaucrat attached to his office was under suspicion for ‘wayward’ behaviour.

182,2020/10/29,Stroke care amid Kerala’s pandemic management,"Delays in seeking care documented over eight months

Neurologists have called for a reorganisation of various aspects of stroke treatment and rehabilitation in the State to overcome the challenges posed by COVID-19 to stroke management and to provide better outcomes for patients.

On World Stroke Day that falls on October 29, they have highlighted the importance of maintaining the continuum of care for stroke patients even in the midst of the pandemic. The public should be encouraged to seek timely treatment for stroke while also ensuring that public health systems have better care strategies in place to give optimum care for stroke patients.

While time is the essence in stroke care, during the past few months, delays in seeking timely care, especially in the case of people who suffer minor strokes or transient ischemic attack (TIA), has been well-documented.

Screening time

However, on top of this, the time taken for screening patients through a COVID gateway, testing and donning of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) etc. has been creating further delays at hospitals, pushing up the door-to-needle time (DNT or the time from presentation of patient with symptoms at the hospital to the start of clot-lysing treatment) beyond the recommended 30-40 minutes.

“In the event of a stroke, accessing timely care is more important than the risk of possible exposure to COVID-19. Comprehensive stroke care centres like ours have now put in place new protocols so that the DNT is well-maintained and acute care is not compromised,” says P.N. Sylaja, Professor of Neurology, who is heading the comprehensive stroke care programme at Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST).

A study conducted in 13 major stroke care centres in the country, including the SCTIMST, on the changes noted in acute stroke care following COVID-19 has reported on overall reduction of about 61.22% in the reporting of weekly stroke cases. Intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular procedures were also severely affected, with an overall reduction of 64.76% and 67.21%, respectively.

Stroke rehabilitation

“Stroke rehabilitation is the key to bringing stroke victims back to normal life but this has been significantly affected during COVID-19 as home physiotherapy is not working out, neither patients nor physiotherapists are willing to take risks. This has resulted in sub-optimal results for patients. We have now started tele-rehabilitation services, mostly speech therapy and tele-consultation services for follow-up of patients,” Dr. Sylaja says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/16kb39/article32969199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29tv-stroke,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/stroke-care-amid-statespandemic-management/article32969200.ece
183,2020/10/29,LSD outbreak puts Wayanad dairy farmers in a fix,"Poor availability of vaccine major concern

An outbreak of lumpy skin disease (LSD), a viral disease causing chronic debility, reduced milk production, poor growth, lack of appetite, infertility, and abortion among cattle is a major concern among dairy farmers in Wayanad, one of the largest milk producing districts in the State.

Dairy farming was the sole income for Janaki of Idichil, a tribal farmer at Cherukara in Vellamunda in the district.

Ms. Janaki had been selling an average of 48 litres of milk a day to a milk cooperative at Vellamunda. When symptoms of the skin disease appeared on a cow on October 11, she informed the veterinary surgeon.

Though a team of veterinarians collected samples from the animal and send them to the State Institute of Animal Disease, Thiruvananthapuram, for further studies, the disease is yet to be brought under control, Ms. Janaki said.

Now, the disease has spread to six of her cows, and the sole income for the seven-member family from dairy business has stopped abruptly. “I have no idea how to feed my cattle,” Ms. Janaki said.

This is the condition of several farmers in the district who have been engaged in dairy farming after the massive destruction of cash crops like pepper, ginger, and arecanut.

LSD has been fast spreading in the district, and the disease has affected around 120 cows in 10 grama panchayats in the district so far. When the disease was first reported at Ambalavayal and Kaniyampetta grama panchayats in August, the outbreak was contained temporarily after a vaccination drive, P.R. Sudheer Kumar, District Chief Veterinary Officer, told The Hindu.

The poor availability of the vaccine is the major concern of veterinarians. “Though we had ordered for 5,000 doses of the vaccine recently, we got only 3,000 doses three days ago,” Dr. Sudheer Kumar, who is also the coordinator of the district animal disease control project, said.

As many as 2,500 doses of the vaccine were disbursed to veterinary clinics in major affected areas including Vellamunda, Thavinhal, Edavaka, Thirunelly, and Mananthavady on Tuesday itself, Dr. Sudheer Kumar said, adding that the remaining quantity would be supplied to other affected areas soon.

Farmers are advised to keep animals suffering from LSD in isolation, as the virus may by spread by flies and mosquitoes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lsd-outbreak-puts-wayanad-dairy-farmers-in-a-fix/article32967586.ece

187,2020/10/29,‘Tehran’ on Apple TV+ is an interplay of the personal and political,"Actors Niv Sultan and Shervin Alenabi talk about how their show has been able to influence opinion and change perception in the aftermath of its airing

An aircraft en route to New Delhi from Jordan is forced to make an emergency landing in Iran. Among the passengers is a pair of couples, travelling for different purposes, but hailing from the same country: Israel.

The first couple is visibly terrified at the thought of having to set foot in Israel while the other seems rather unfazed. Having betrayed the intentions of the two couples, the sequence serves as point where the plot forks – one taking the narrative forward and the other proceeding to depict the prevailing tension between Iran and Israel – only for it to dovetail seamlessly later on.

Treading this duality, Tehran, which began streaming on Apple TV+ last month, is both a personal and political story. Set firmly against the backdrop of Iran-Israel tensions, it revolves around a female Mossad (Israel intelligence agency) agent’s attempt to infiltrate Iran, gain access to its radar system and neutralise its nuclear program. The show also grazes upon the political situation in the Muslim country.

Tamar Rabinyan, the protagonist, is essayed by the Israeli actress Niv Sultan. Like Niv, who grew up in Israel after being born to a father who migrated from Morocco, her character too, despite being an Israeli undercover agent, has Iranian roots.

Over the course of the show, Tamar Rabinyan develops several more layers. “She’s not just a Mossad agent. Neither is she just a young girl falling in love. She’s multi-dimensional. And that’s the beauty of it” says Niv over a video call.

Niv Sultan in ‘Tehran’

For Niv, it was the intensity and relevance of the story that hooked her. “It was gripping to read. Everything was happening so fast and big.”

Shervin Alenaby plays Milad Kahani – a hacker operating on dark web. Shervin was intrigued by the cliffhangers in the story for he would get the scripts only one by one. “I would be dying to know what happened next.”

Directed by Daniel Syrkin, the writing credits of Tehran also include Fauda writer Moshe Zonder. First broadcast in Israel in July, the telecast had an uncanny coincidence when it overlapped with an attack on the nuclear reactors in Iran.

Asked about the difference in reactions garnered by the show after its worldwide telecast and Niv says, “It’s largely been the same. All of them have been good.” She then lists out the different parts from where the messages have been pouring in, “Scotland, Argentina and India.”

For Shervin, the positive reception is not just validation. “One of the greatest things about this job is the ability to impact people. You can change their perception,” he says. “In today’s world, culture is driven by conversations. And being able to inform people is a great thing. You feel useful.”

Actors Shervin Alenabi and Niv Sultan talk about the impact of ‘Tehran’

Niv attests to this. “As actors, we want to tell stories and we want those stories to make an impact.”

She also believes that the show speaks about humanity. “We are people. We are all the same; in the sense, we have families that care about us,” says Niv ringing true to some of the plot lines of the show.

Shervin, who was originally born in Iran and now lives in the U.K, hopes the show would help the rest of the world get better acquainted with the two countries. “One similarity between Iran and Israel is that there is a veil of mystery around both countries.”

“For people to become more familiar with my culture would be hugely beneficial to my community. Because, we feel we’ve been hard done by the media. To be able to take our power back through storytelling is a great thing, and I hope it will add a drop to the ocean towards some kind of change,” he concludes.

190,2020/10/29,‘Holidate’ movie review: A nightmare for every holiday,"Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey star in this colossal mess on Netflix about two platonic lovers trying to navigate the holidays together

Oh dear! There is nothing to save this romcom from the dung heap. Christmas, New Year’s, Valentines’, Easter, the Fourth of July, Halloween, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas again and a wedding cannot salvage this mess. Neither can a pretty boy from Oz (why? because Luke Bracey is Australian) an irritating cute girl, barmy friends, insane mum, weird aunt and a horrid, precocious child save it.

Sloane (Emma Roberts) works from home (don’t we all now?) and was going out with hot, or shall we say, haute Luc who turned out to be the lowest form of pond-life. They broke up and she is nursing a broken heart while her manic mum tries to set her up with terrible dates. Then, there is Jackson (Luke Bracey), a regular bloke from Australia. He drops, “mate” and “cricket” at regular intervals and is stuck with a girlfriend from hell over Christmas.

Holidate Director: John Whitesell

Cast: Emma Roberts, Luke Bracey, Jake Manley, Jessica Capshaw, Andrew Bachelor, Frances Fisher, Manish Dayal, Kristin Chenoweth

Story line: Sloane and Jackson decide to be each other’s platonic dates for the holidays but realise they have feelings for each other

Run time: 104 minutes

Sloane meets Jackson at the mall and they decide to be each other’s dates for the many holidays in a calendar year from New Year’s Day to Thanksgiving and Christmas with the odd family wedding thrown in. It is platonic as sex complicates matters. Naturally they discover they have feelings for each other and after the sex, the big misunderstanding, the sulks, the tears and the tantrums... it all comes well again full a circle at a mall.

Holidate is rather cynical and the Christmas-themed jumpers cruelly reminded us of the lovely Bridget Jones’s Diary. Better watch Mark Darcy carry off the reindeer sweater, Daniel Cleaver be his irresistible caddish self and Salman Rushdie being repeatedly asked where the toilet is at the book launch rather than waste time on this tasteless mess.

The State government is eager to work with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) to facilitate rapid industrial growth between Madurai and Kanniyakumari, said Revenue and Information Technology Minister R.B. Udayakumar here on Wednesday.

Speaking at the inaugural session of the two-day ""CII Connect Madurai 2020 - developing southern Tamil Nadu as a value added ICT destination"" organised by the CII, he said that the steps taken by the TN government over the last five to nine years had spurred many small and medium industries, besides major IT firms, to show interest in setting up shop in the southern districts of Tamil Nadu.

HCL, Honeywell are among top corporates who have mega expansion plans to their existing operations here. Likewise, new players too have come up in Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Nagercoil, he said.

The government is committed to put infrastructural facilities in place, Mr. Udayakumar said and added that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the IT and IT enabled services had come out with good results in their quarterly performance reports in the State.

He was confident that TN would become the ICT hub of south Asia. It is just a matter of time. With the technical expertise available here, the contribution would be phenomenal. Towards achieving this objective, the government had been according top priority for creating a knowledge driven eco-system, leverage entrepreneurship and promote socially inclusive growth.

199,2020/10/29,High Court quashes TNSEC's order for re-election in Kumalankulam panchayat,"Judge says court can step in to prevent subversion of electoral process

Tamil Nadu State Election Commission (TNSEC) cannot be allowed to conduct re-election in a local body where attempts had been made to subvert the election process after declaration of results, the Madras High Court has ruled.

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh held so while setting aside an order passed by TNSEC on June 22 for conducting re-election in Kumalankulam village panchayat in Keerapalayam Panchayat Union of Cuddalore district.

The judge directed the TNSEC to declare the writ petitioner R. Jayalakshmi as the winning candidate since she had secured the highest number of 2,524 votes after contesting the elections using the auto rickshaw symbol allotted to her.

He pointed that another contestant by name Vijayalakshmi had contested in lock and key symbol and secured only 1,478 votes. However, after declaring the results, the officials had interchanged the symbols between the two contestants in one of the forms.

""This is a clear after thought and an apparent attempt made to dislodge the election process for reasons best known to the official respondents,"" the judge said and ruled that it does not call for cancelling the entire election and ordering fresh polls.

Though the TNSEC as well as the State Government contended that the petitioner could only file an election petition and not a writ petition, the judge rejected their contention on the ground that the petitioner had challenged only TNSEC's cancellation order and not the election process.

""This court cannot mechanically relegate the parties to file an election petition when the monstrosity of the situation apparently establishes subversion of the election process by adopting illegal means. These are exceptional cases where this court has to step in and exercise its writ jurisdiction and prevent such subversion of election process.

""The case on hand clearly falls under this category. Therefore, the plea taken on the side of the respondents regarding the alternative remedy available to the petitioner, under the Panchayat Act, is held to be not sustainable,"" the judge said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-quashes-tnsecs-order-for-re-election-in-kumalankulam-panchayat/article32968799.ece

201,2020/10/29,Child-friendly zones set up in six all-women police stations,"Facility will take care of children accompanying their mothers

The Cuddalore district police have created child-friendly spaces in the All Women Police Stations (AWPS) in Cuddalore, Panruti, Chidambaram, Sethiyathope, Neyveli and Virudhachalam. They are aimed at ensuring a friendly environment to children.

A number of women who approach the AWPS for lodging complaints, including domestic abuse, are invariably accompanied by their children.

The mothers bring their children as they cannot leave them alone at home.

“We wanted to have a safe and playful environment for the children and created child-friendly spaces. An enquiry will obviously take time.

“While the parents are meeting the police officers, the children will be taken to the spaces within the premises and kept there till the process is over,” says Superintendent of Police M. Sree Abhinav. Cartoon characters have been painted on the walls and colouring books and toys are also available to keep the children engaged.

The facility is similar to a crèche and has mats for kids to sleep, Mr. Abhinav also added.

According to Sethiyathope AWPS inspector Agnesh Mary, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012 mandates provisioning of child-friendly atmosphere.

As per the Act the victim has to be safeguarded at every stage of the judicial process by having child-friendly mechanisms for reporting and investigation.

“When victims of Pocso cases are brought to the AWPS, they initially refuse to talk as the incident has a tremendous effect on the mental health of the child. Now, we have tried to make the children comfortable by setting up child-friendly centres. The facility will also help provide an atmosphere of security to them”, she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/w22v1b/article32968656.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THCHILDREN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/child-friendly-zones-set-up-in-six-all-women-police-stations/article32968657.ece

K. Thamarai, a resident of Tiruvannamalai, had been informed by the TNPSC that she was selected provisionally for appointment by direct recruitment to the post of Junior Assistant in the Stationery and Printing Department.

“I got my appointment order in March and due to the delay owing to COVID-19, I and a few others who were selected were asked to join on August 17. However on that day, the others who went to the department were given their responsibilities and I was told at the Commissioner's office that the job wasn’t suitable for me, as I am visually-impaired,” she alleged. She said that she cleared the Group IV exams with a score of 202 marks and that she has two small children to support.

A letter that Ms. Thamarai subsequently received from the Stationery and Printing Department indicated that since she does not have any technical certifications and wasn’t certified to carry out book binding work, the department was unable to accommodate her. The letter further stated that there were already two visually impaired persons, who were telephone operators and owing to that, there were no vacant positions.

“I have received an appointment as a junior assistant and my role has nothing to do with book binding. The letter I received also pointed out that I was visually impaired, had taken up the Group IV exams with a scribe and used braille to read. Why should these be held against me?,” Ms. Thamarai questioned.

C. Govindakrishnan, founder, Nethrodaya said that the department has discriminated against Ms. Thamarai, which was a violation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016.

""It is the duty of every government establishment to provide reasonable accommodation and a barrier-free as well as a conducive environment for its employees with disabilities,” he said. He has, further, submitted a letter to the State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities, asking for action to be initiated, as well as conduct a detailed inquiry, as to why Ms. Thamarai has been denied a posting in the department.

In a statement, Dr. Anbumani said that almost 11 lakh students have benefited from the scheme since it’s introduction in 2011-12. “There are media reports that these two schemes will not be implemented for this year and the money will be spent for the purpose of containment of Covid-19. This would affect the studies of the students,” he said.

Dr. Anbumani said that if the scheme was continued next year, it would create more confusion as the State Government would need to provide free laptops and cycles for Classes XI and XII students next year. “This would create confusion. Everyone knows the difficulties faced by officials for the first two years when the schemes were introduced,” he said.

Dr. Anbumani added that PMK did not believe in providing ‘useless freebies’ but when it comes to education, everything – from pieces of chalk to laptops – should be given for free.

204,2020/10/29,E-registration now for visits to hill stations,"Provision of basic details regarding visit sufficient, A-G tells High Court

Those looking to visit hill stations in the State no longer need to obtain prior permission by applying for e-passes. Henceforth, it will be sufficient if they provide basic details regarding their visit, through e-registration, and obtain an auto-generated acknowledgement, Advocate-General Vijay Narayan informed the Madras High Court on Wednesday.

The submission was made before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, who closed a writ petition filed against the State government’s earlier insistence on obtaining prior permission before visiting hill stations.

Easing restrictions

The A-G told the court that a government order had been issued on Tuesday, replacing the requirement of obtaining e-passes with e-registration. Under the new system, there was no question of denial of permission. Visitors just had to enter basic details regarding their visit and undertake travel.

Pointing out that the State government had already replaced the old system of issuing e-passes with e-registration for those visiting Tamil Nadu from other countries and States, the A-G said a similar registration system had been introduced for visits to hill stations too.

When the petitioner’s counsel insisted that e-registration must be permitted after travel too, the Chief Justice refused to pass any such order.

He said some restrictions must be in place to keep a check on the spread of COVID-19, since many people were not following the safety norms required to keep the virus at bay.

Recalling his recent visit to see the sunrise in Kanniyakumari, the CJ said 800-1,000 people had gathered at the spot and 75% of them were not wearing masks. He immediately asked the police to make an announcement through the public address system about the necessity to wear masks and maintain physical distancing.

The CJ said he also asked the district legal services authority to arrange for masks and personally distributed about 250 of them among those who had gathered there. Hence, it is essential that some regulations are in place and there is nothing wrong in going for e-registration before undertaking travel to hill stations, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/e-registration-now-for-visits-to-hill-stations/article32967782.ece
205,2020/10/29,Vacancies soar after TNEA counselling,"Intake stands at 1,57,689 seats; govt. nod awaited for supplementary counselling

After four rounds of single-window counselling for engineering admissions, 71,195 seats have been filled. The total intake for this year stood at 1,57,689 seats, in 461 colleges. The Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) committee had declared 1,10,873 candidates eligible.

TNEA officials are awaiting the government’s nod to conduct supplementary counselling, in which several hundred more seats may get filled.

Only 13 colleges, including Anna University’s four campuses, the government engineering college in Salem, CIPET, CECRI and the Indian Institute of Handloom Technology, Salem, besides PSG College of Technology, PSG Institute of Technology and Applied Research and Thiagarajar College of Engineering, have managed to fill all seats.

From the first round, absenteeism has been hovering past 37%. In the first round, 38.76% candidates did not turn up for counselling. This rose to 41.43% in the second round and fell to 40.23% in the third. In the fourth round, absenteeism stood at 31.42%,

Absenteeism in government seats has not resulted in candidates seeking seats under management quota either.

Several middle-rung colleges have not been able to fill even 50% of their management quota seats, college officials said.

Anna University Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa said, “It is a combination of factors. In the last few years, the employability of engineering graduates has come down drastically. Except computer science and information technology, all other branches, especially manufacturing and civil engineering, have not been able to take in students. More students are aspiring for higher education. The Alagappa College of Technology, which usually faces difficulty in filling seats, has filled all seats this year.”

Government colleges offering Tamil-medium engineering programmes too are struggling to fill seats, he said. Students find other avenues, such as B.Sc programmes, short-term and certificate courses, more appealing.

206,2020/10/29,Analysis | Applicability of Bihar’s Mahadalits model to T.N. divides opinion,"Issue pertains to re-categorisation of six castes as Devendra Kula Vellalars

Opinion remains divided among serving and retired policymakers over the applicability of the Mahadalits model of Bihar for addressing the demand for re-categorisation of a group of six castes as Devendra Kula Vellalars in Tamil Nadu.

Senior officials who follow the issue closely are of the view that the State government ought to take the consent of the Centre in the event that it agrees with the position of the proponents of the demand.

However, a former secretary of the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department feels that based on the Mahadalits model, the Tamil Nadu government can issue an executive order without attempting to alter the State's list of Scheduled Castes.

The issue at hand is that sections of people belonging to six castes — Kudumban, Pallan, Devendrakulathan, Kadaiyan, Pannadi and Kalladi — would like to have the generic name, Devendra Kula Vellalars. Their demand is being considered by a committee of State government officials.

Another demand

There is one more demand, which pertains to the removal of their castes from the Schedule. But this is not being addressed by the panel.

The clue that the Mahadalits example of Bihar provides to Tamil Nadu is that the government there, without the Centre’s sanction, took a decision in 2007 to call certain SCs ‘Mahadalits’.

Till date, this has not been approved by the Central government. But the absence of the Union government’s approval is no bar to the Bihar government in implementing a number of welfare schemes for the Mahadalits.

Still, C. Chellappan, former member of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes, is of the view that it would be proper for the Tamil Nadu government to obtain the Centre’s nod if it accedes to the re-categorisation demand, as otherwise, this may get caught in a serious legal battle.

But the supporter of the Bihar model says the State government, while issuing its order, can stipulate that the proposed generic name can be mentioned in caste certificates in respect of those who request for it.

Former police officer V. Kamaraja and Sholavandan legislator K. Manickam believe the State government is fully empowered to act in this regard.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/article23794718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Interview-SundaG2L3U9NV53jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/applicability-of-bihars-mahadalits-model-to-tn-divides-opinion/article32967747.ece
207,2020/10/29,VCK buoyed by response to ‘ban Manusmriti’ campaign,"Senior leaders say they have walked into a political goldmine

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) founder Thol. Thirumavalavan’s decision to organise State-wide protests demanding a ban on Hindu religious text Manusmriti may have been borne out of a necessity to respond to a social media campaign, which said he disrespected women, but senior leaders in the party say they have inadvertently walked into a “political goldmine”.

VCK general secretary Sinthanai Selvan said the party was forced to respond to and counter-attack the “smear campaign” to create a perception that Mr. Thirumavalavan disrespects Hindu women. “They took a small video clipping of his speech at an intellectual forum to portray our leader as someone who disrespects women. If you remember, PMK also created such a narrative against him [in the past]. We had to respond to ensure this doesn’t become another ‘Karuppar Koottam’ [a group accused of denigrating Kanda Shasti Kavasam]. We did not want to be on the back foot,” he told The Hindu. “We didn’t expect this kind of support for our campaign,” he said.

“Since we are in the middle of the rainy season, we want to take this issue beyond November. We want to extend it up until Pongal. The protests have attracted rationalist and secular organisations, spread across Tamil Nadu, towards VCK,” he said.

Mr. Thirumavalavan’s campaign has reinvigorated the now forgotten ideals of the Dravidian movement (anti-caste and anti-Brahminism) politics, contended J. Balasubramanian, assistant professor, journalism, Madurai Kamaraj University. According to him, Hindu right-wing forces view Mr. Thirumavalavan as an obstacle to their growth in Tamil Nadu. “The right wing wants to ensure that Mr. Thirumavalavan becomes a political orphan and is dropped from the DMK alliance. The reason being that he has become such a strong critic of Hindutva, despite being part of electoral politics, and his [anticipated] success in the 2021 Assembly elections, and a strong presence of the VCK, will be an obstacle for the growth of BJP in Tamil Nadu,” he said.

Punitha Pandian, editor, Dalit Murasu, said: “Going back to the roots, and speaking the politics of Ambedkar and Periyar should be welcome.” It will only strengthen VCK’s position in the DMK alliance, Mr. Pandian said. “No matter what agenda they have, a political party calling for a ban on the Manusmriti is unprecedented. Last year, he organised a conference against Sanatana Dharma. VCK has also demanded reservations for OBCs; it is also trying to reach out to them. They are trying to unite OBCs and Dalits against a common enemy which is Manusmriti. This will strengthen the DMK alliance,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/4zwux/article32967714.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THTHIRUMAVALAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vck-buoyed-by-response-to-ban-manusmriti-campaign/article32967715.ece
208,2020/10/29,Coronavirus | 31 of 37 districts in Tamil Nadu see under 100 fresh infections,"For the second consecutive day, Tamil Nadu recorded a little over 2,500 new cases of COVID-19, with 31 of 37 districts reporting less than 100 fresh cases.

A total of 2,516 persons tested positive for COVID-19. Chennai saw fewer than 700 cases, and 35 persons, including a 101-year-old woman, died.

Fresh infections have been marginally declining in the State in the last few days. The State’s tally stood at 7,16,751.

The number of active cases came down to 26,356, as 3,859 more persons were discharged after treatment. Till date, a total of 6,79,377 persons have been discharged in the State.

With 35 more fatalities being recorded, the State’s toll crossed 11,000.

Till date, a total of 11,018 persons have succumbed to COVID-19.

The 101-year-old woman from Chengalpattu had systemic hypertension, and had tested positive for COVID-19 on October 20. She was admitted to the Government Corona Hospital, Guindy, on October 25. However, she died within a few minutes of admission, due to COVID-19 pneumonia, respiratory failure and systemic hypertension.

Nine persons died in Chennai, seven in Coimbatore, and two each in Chengalpattu, Salem, Tiruvallur and Tiruppur.

209,2020/10/29,CB-CID to probe PG medical admissions,"Police directed to investigate possible nexus between DME and private colleges

The Madras High Court on Wednesday ordered a Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) inquiry to ascertain if there was a conspiracy between officials of the Directorate of Medical Education (DME) and private medical colleges, in filling up 74 management quota postgraduate seats without conducting mop-up counselling this year.

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh wanted the Director General of Police to ensure that the scope of the inquiry is extended to find the amount of money collected by private colleges from students admitted on August 31 — the last date for PG admissions. The investigators were further given liberty to probe other issues that unfold.

The judge directed the investigating team to submit its report before the court on or before January 31 and directed the Registry to list the case for reporting compliance on February 1. He expressed anguish over medical seats being allotted to unmeritorious candidates every year on one pretext or the other, and said that COVID-19 had come in handy this year.

Hearing cases filed by meritorious candidates who had either lost the chance of getting admitted in postgraduate courses or could not shift to a better branch of medicine due to the non-conduct of mop-up counselling, the judge wondered how the DME could permit private colleges to fill management quota seats on their own on August 31.

The judge said the DME ought to have approached the Supreme Court seeking more time, without presuming that the latter would not grant any extension. A failure to do so had resulted in 36 of the 74 PG seats getting filled with candidates who had secured somewhere between 200 to 300 marks in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET).

Further, 23 more seats had been filled with candidates who had secured just 300 to 400 marks. “Candidates who had really worked hard and secured higher marks than these candidates will get an impression that there is something beyond merit that can secure admission for a candidate, and that is their purchasing power,” the judge lamented.

Justice Venkatesh went on to state: “There is something more than what meets the eye when it comes to filling up seats in private medical colleges, other than by way of counselling. These are all obviously candidates who are capable of pulling strings and already had a clear understanding with the college concerned college.

“When push came to shove, prior understanding translated itself into final action and the candidates got admitted into the course. Every year, some mechanism is devised by self-financing colleges to fill up vacancies in this manner… At the end of the day, money, contacts and power should not be the determining factor for getting a seat,” he said.

Observing that it was important to identify the malice afflicting the system by taking the bull by its horns, Justice Venkatesh said stringent steps must be taken to ensure probity and send a strong message that such illegal actions would not be tolerated. He was of the view that only an independent investigation would expose the culprits behind the conspiracy.

“A society which perpetrates or encourages or celebrates mediocrity is bound to sink and perish at some point of time. This is more so when it comes to dealing with education, and, particularly, medical education. A State can never take the chance of filling up a medical seat vacancy with an unmeritorious candidate since it directly involves the life of a person,” the judge said.

On the DME’s claim that COVID-19 was the reason for the non-conduct of mop-up counselling for management quota seats, the judge said, “There is an attempt to put every blame on COVID-19, even when it does not have a direct nexus to the action performed by an institution or any instrumentality of the State. There cannot be a greater sin than to make use of the present situation and gain advantage for one’s self-aggrandisement.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/3mzr51/article32967588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cb-cid-to-probe-pg-medical-admissions/article32967589.ece
210,2020/10/29,Controversial ABVP leader made member of AIIMS in Madurai,"Oppn. leaders condemn appointment; Subbiah was accused of harassing woman

The Union Health Ministry has appointed controversial oncologist and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) president Shanmugam Subbiah as a member of the proposed All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Madurai, triggering strong condemnation from Opposition parties.

DMK president M.K. Stalin, MDMK leader Vaiko and MPs from different parties in the State criticised his appointment.

Dr. Subbiah, professor and head, Department of Surgical Oncology, Government Kilpauk Medical College, Chennai, was in the news a few months ago after he was accused of urinating outside the apartment of an elderly woman, following a row over the parking of his car. CCTV footage of the incident was widely circulated on social media. Dr. Subbiah denied the charges, and the complaint was eventually withdrawn following an alleged compromise.

In a notification on October 15, Sunil Sharma, Joint Secretary, Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, mentioned him as one of the members of AIIMS, Madurai.

Mr. Stalin on Wednesday demanded the removal of the oncologist from the AIIMS board and the appointment of MPs from Tamil Nadu in his place. In a statement, he said the AIIMS was set up from the taxpayer’s money and not from the BJP’s party fund. “It is a gross misuse of power to appoint Dr. Subbiah to the position. His appointment is proof that the BJP has no respect for women,” he said.

He said by appointing Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University Vice-Chancellor Sudha Seshayyan to the AIIMS board, the BJP had actually insulted her.

‘Denigrating institution’

MDMK general secretary Vaiko demanded that Dr. Subbiah be removed from the board, saying his appointment had denigrated a great institution.

Expressing shock, DMK MP Kanimozhi wondered, “Is this an endorsement of his indecent behaviour and an incentive for other BJP cadre to follow suit?”

Virudhunagar MP B. Manickam Tagore (Congress) said he was given the post only because of his association with the RSS.

Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan (CPI-M) questioned whether the new post was given to Dr. Subbiah for his “lowly act”.

Villupuram MP Ravikumar (VCK) said his appointment was an insult to women. TNCC president K.S. Alagiri demanded Dr. Subbiah’s immediate removal from the committee.

211,2020/10/29,AIADMK re-organises Chennai district units,"Their number is now up from 5 to 8

The ruling AIADMK on Wednesday announced the re-organisation of district units in Chennai.

Earlier, there were five district units. The number has now gone up to eight. The new units were carved out of the North Chennai (South) and South Chennai (North and South) units. Each district secretary would have two Assembly constituencies to look after.

The three new district secretaries are Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar, organising secretary Adhi Rajaram and former Velachery legislator M.K. Ashok. They will be in charge of the district units of North Chennai (South-East), North Chennai (South-West) and South Chennai (South-East) respectively, according to a press release issued by coordinator-Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam and co-coordinator-Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami.

The existing three functionaries, N. Balaganga, B. Sathyanarayanan and V.N. Ravi, will hereafter be the district secretaries for North Chennai (South-West), South Chennai (North-West) and South Chennai (South-South).

R.S. Rajesh — North Chennai (North-East) and T.G. Venkatesh Babu — North Chennai (North-West) were left untouched in the latest exercise.

Mr. Jayakumar was appointed the district secretary for the undivided North Chennai unit in 2000 and 2010. In both the 2001 and 2011 Assembly elections, the party performed well in the northern parts of the city.

Mr. Rajaram, who was made the secretary of the South Chennai unit in November 1994, became a controversial figure when his name figured as a key accused in a case of assault concerning advocate K.M. Vijayan, who ran a legal battle against the State government’s policy of 69% quota. He was acquitted by a trial court in October 1996 which was confirmed by the Madras High Court in August 2012. During the 2006 Assembly election, he lost to DMK leader M.K. Stalin in Thousand Lights. Mr Balaganga, who was Central Chennai district secretary during 2001-06, became the North Chennai (South) district secretary in 2011.

214,2020/10/29,"Did Governor authorise fine for flouting of COVID-19 safety norms, asks HC","The Madras High Court on Wednesday wanted to know whether the Governor had approved a government gazette notification issued on September 4 for the collection of fines ranging from ₹200 to ₹5,000 for issues such as violation of quarantine measures, failure to wear masks, non-adherence to physical distancing norms, spitting in public places and so on.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy raised the query during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed by R.

In his affidavit, the litigant said Section 76(2) of the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act of 1939 was amended recently, empowering government officials to enforce certain acts required to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The amendment did not declare non-adherence to such norms as a punishable offence that could be compounded. Yet, the government, through the gazette notification, declared them to be offences which could be compounded on payment of fine.

216,2020/10/29,Northeast monsoon sets in over State,"It is expected to pick up pace in a few days, according to the Met Department

The northeast monsoon set in over the south peninsular region, including Tamil Nadu and Kerala, on Wednesday. While it made a weak onset over the State, it is expected to pick up pace in a few days, according to the Meteorological Department.

Northeasterly winds and a cyclonic circulation over the southwest Bay of Bengal, off the coast of northern Tamil Nadu, aided the commencement of the northeast monsoon. After an extended stay, the southwest monsoon retreated from the country on Wednesday and paved the way for the onset of the northeast monsoon.

Tamil Nadu receives an average of 44 cm of rain during the northeast monsoon between October and December.

S. Balachandran, Deputy Director of Meteorology, Chennai, said the northeast monsoon commenced with sporadic rain over southern Tamil Nadu and the coastal areas of the State, and did not cover the entire region.

Melur in Madurai district received 6 cm rainfall, the highest during the 24 hours ending at 8.30 a.m. on Wednesday. In Chennai district, Nungambakkkam and Sholinganalllur received 1 cm rainfall.

“There was no significant weather system to bring heavy rain. The cyclone over the Pacific Ocean, too, was drawing moisture away. The influence of the global weather pattern La Niña could also be a reason for the weak start of the monsoon,” he said.

Though the average onset date is around October 20, a deviation of seven or eight days is still considered normal.

For the next two to three days, the Meteorological Department has forecast light to moderate rain over a few parts of southern Tamil Nadu and one or two places in northern parts of the State and Puducherry. There may be heavy rain over one or two areas in Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Virudhunagardistricts. In Chennai, light to moderate rain or thundershowers are likely in some areas till Friday.

217,2020/10/29,UGC files counter in case against cancellation of arrear exams,"Desists from commenting directly on correctness of decision taken by T.N. government

The University Grants Commission (UGC) has desisted from offering any direct comment on the correctness or otherwise of a decision taken by the State government to cancel arrear examinations of all arts, science, engineering and Master of Computer Application students except for those pursuing final year during the current academic year.

In a counter affidavit filed before the Madras High Court in response to a case by former Anna University vice-chancellor E. Balagurusamy, the UGC stated that it had insisted upon all universities in the country to complete final year or terminal semester examinations alone before September 30 and that the Supreme Court too had ruled in favour of its decision.

The counter, served on the former V-C’s counsel E. Vijay Anand, read that the UGC had come up with a first set of guidelines on April 29 to deal with a situation that had arisen due to COVID-19. Those guidelines permitted universities to conduct terminal/intermediate semester/year end examinations through online or offline mode after following all social distancing norms and reducing the duration from three to two hours, if necessary.

Subsequently, on June 7, the Commission issued revised guidelines instructing all universities to complete the final year or terminal semester examinations by September 30. The guidelines were challenged before the Supreme Court on several grounds. One of the grounds was that they discriminated between final year students and others.

However, the apex court rejected the contention by stating that there was a rationale behind the decision since academic evaluation of final year students was a very important milestone in any education system and it was a reflection of the competence, performance and credibility that was essential for global acceptability.

The Supreme Court also ruled that State governments or universities could not decide to evaluate final year or terminal semester students through internal marks without holding examinations as instructed by UGC. They were however given liberty to seek extension of time beyond September 30 if the examinations could not be conducted before that due to COVID-19.

218,2020/10/29,Concern over increase in minimum balance for postal savings accounts,"It has been raised from ₹50 to ₹500; penalty to be levied if rule is not followed

Postal customers have raised concern over the increase in minimum balance for savings bank accounts. The Department of Posts had also given a deadline to maintain the new minimum balance by December.

The department had recently issued a circular in post offices that the minimum balance for savings account had been raised from ₹50 to ₹500. This has caused worry among many customers. Customers in southern suburbs noted that the post offices now insisted that account holders must maintain a minimum balance of ₹500 by December 11.

Post offices would levy a penalty of ₹100 every year for failing to maintain a minimum amount in account.

V.Santhanam, social activist, said many customers, particularly in the city’s peripheral areas and rural localities, were unorganised workers. Some belonged to the middle class.

“The low minimum balance in post office savings accounts had attracted many to open new accounts. It would burden many customers who can’t afford to open bank accounts,” he said.

In Chromepet post office alone, there were about 25,000 such accounts and many of them made transactions within ₹500. The department may consider increasing the minimum amount to ₹100, he added.

Residents demanded that the postal department must withdraw the raise in minimum balance and also annual penalty. They plan to make representation to the Department of Posts, Tambaram division, and also plan to hold a protest in Chromepet soon.

Officials of the Postal Department said there were about three crore accounts, including recurring deposit and monthly income scheme, across the State. The announcement related to minimum balance would have an impact on nearly two crore accounts.

“We have already recommended to the Union Ministry of Finance to withdraw the announcement on minimum balance and consider revising it to ₹100-₹200 and cancel the penalty. We have also suggested postponing the deadline for maintaining new balance,” a senior official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ixh60f/article32967258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POSTOFFICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/concern-over-increase-in-minimum-balance-for-postal-savings-accounts/article32967259.ece

A senior official said the State government was also waiting for the Centre to issue guidelines for the reopening of schools.

It is also learnt that a member of the medical committee felt that the government could look at allowing students of Classes 9 to 12 to attend classes in school. “But overall, the feeling was that there should not be any hurry to reopen schools and colleges,” the official said, adding that a few Collectors felt that a decision on reopening cinemas could be taken at a later date.

At the review meeting, Mr. Palaniswami said a decision on representations received from the film industry for the reopening of cinemas would be taken based on inputs from Collectors and the medical committee.

He expressed concern over the people’s lack of compliance with COVID-19 prevention measures. He said nearly 35% of the people were not wearing masks in spite of the State government’s efforts to create awareness.

“The Deepavali festival is around the corner. In Chennai, there are streets full of people, many of whom are not wearing masks. The police should continuously create awareness. Only then will we have a situation where everyone is wearing a mask and be able to stop the spread of the virus,” he said.

Despite efforts to bring the number of cases down, there had been a sudden spike in some districts, he said, and advised the Collectors to take steps to curb COVID-19.

“In some districts, the number of [daily] cases is above 100. Before Deepavali, it should be brought down to less than 100. In districts with less than 100 cases, the number should be brought down to below 50. In districts reporting less than 50 cases, it should be brought down to nil. I request district administrations to work towards ensuring that we move to a situation where there is no spread of COVID-19,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

The Chief Minister said Collectors should monitor whether proper treatment is being provided to patients and whether all protocols are being followed.

He also praised the district officials for the decline in cases and expressed confidence that very soon, the State would be free from the spread of the virus.

The Chief Minister also told the police department that some people were trying to create law and order problems in the State and urged them to be vigilant and keep a watch on them and keep the people of the State safe.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/m6s0vn/article32967240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Edappadi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/coronavirus-curbs-likely-to-stay-on-tamil-nadu-schools-colleges-cinemas/article32967241.ece

221,2020/10/29,"Over 93% govt. school students have textbooks, says report","31.3% lacked smartphones and couldn’t receive learning material

Adapting to the changes that have swept through school education over the last few months owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 15th Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2020 Wave 1 was released, based on a phone-based survey which was carried out in September.

A higher number of students from government schools had access to textbooks in Tamil Nadu, According to the survey, nearly 93.7% of the students from government schools in the State had access to textbooks whereas only 68.1% of private school students had them. Of all the children surveyed, 64.6% of them were found to have access to digital learning through smartphones.

In 31 districts, a sample of 6,472 households from 923 villages had been identified and 2,134 students aged between 5-16 years were spoken to. The study aimed to look at various aspects of school education and its impact under COVID-19. This included school enrollment patterns, household resources available, home support available for learning and access to learning material.

Around 31.3% of students from government schools, however, indicated that they weren’t able to receive learning material since they had no smart phones, in comparison to the 19.3% of private school students who cited lack of smartphones as a reason for not being able to access material.

Despite numerous platforms for online classes, WhatsApp was used predominantly to send learning resources and material to both private and government school students in Tamil Nadu. Findings indicated that 73.2% of government school students received learning material via Whatsapp in comparison to 90% of private school students. 14.1% government students received their learning materials through a personal visit from their teachers as opposed to just 1.5% of students from private schools - an indication of the veetupalli scheme in the State where teachers from government schools have been visiting students as well as have started to set up micro classrooms.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/over-93-govt-school-students-have-textbooks-says-report/article32967182.ece

223,2020/10/29,"Now, focus on digital survey of land","‘Cooperate with officials involved in the exercise’

After the launch of Dharani, the portal of integrated land record management system, the State government has now set its eyes on starting survey of entire land across the State.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao asserted that every inch of land would be measured and boundaries would be fixed to avoid land-related disputes once and for all. Orders for the conduct of the digital survey would be issued within a few days and the work would be taken up at the earliest.

The government had decided to give latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates to the entire land in the process. “Giving geo-coordinates will make land records 100 per cent tamper proof,” he said. The Chief Minister was addressing a public meeting after formally launching Dharani portal at this village, about 50 km from the State Capital.

The survey was aimed at ensuring that issues pertaining to forest, podu and wakf lands were settled once the boundaries of the properties were demarcated. The government was committed to protect these lands and at the same time, ensure that interests of the land owners were protected. He exhorted the people to cooperate with the officials who would be deployed on survey work so that the State could become role model for the country. Elected representatives at mandal and district levels should form teams to assist the surveying teams in effectively completing the process.

‘States enquiring’

The Chief Minister elaborated on the more than three-year exercise that went into preparing Dharani portal, considered one of its kind in the country, and said officials concerned were initially sceptical about operationalisation of the new system. But, the portal was prepared so effectively that registration and mutation of the documents would done on the same day and there would be real time updation of data online.

“Several Chief Ministers called me to know about the new reform and expressed doubts over the efficacy of the portal. The new portal is sure to usher in revolution in the country and mount pressure on other States to follow suit. But the portal cannot be emulated so easily as it has been designed in a fool proof manner in exercise spanning more than three years,” he asserted.

Explaining the efforts that went into the design and preparation of Dharani portal, he said the government had decided to leverage the advantage of information technology in providing transparent services to the people and Dharani was accordingly launched. “A Chief Minister who spoke a lot about IT in the past never conceived such measures. It is our government and conceptualised and brought IT intervention in land administration,” he said.

‘Hide’ option

When reporters asked him about the reluctance of owners of non-agricultural properties to share details during an informal chat, he said the government would give a “hide” option to them. Accordingly, property owners who give their details should select the ‘hide’ option in the column provided so that details of their properties would not be displayed for others. “Entering the details into Dharani is must. But owners will be given an option if they want the information to be kept confidential,” he said.

To another question, he said the government had not effected any changes in the registration values and old rates would continue. The government rates pertaining to lands survey number wise could be accessed online through Dharani portal for those interested in buying lands.

The Chief Minister cautioned people against vested interests who would try to create obstructions in the implementation of Dharani and other reforms that were aimed at protecting their interests. Dharani, being a new system, could face minor irritants technically in the initial stages, but people should not get influenced by any adverse propaganda. “Teams have been set up at different levels to address technical issues. One should not be unduly worried if there is delay in registration process,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/now-focus-is-on-digital-survey-of-land/article32976203.ece
224,2020/10/29,Shapoorji Pallonji to build new Secretariat,"Company emerged lowest bidder quoting 4.02% excess

Infrastructure development company Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Private Limited has been selected to take up construction of the new integrated secretariat complex.

The bid submitted by the Mumbai-based company was evaluated as the lowest qualified tender at 4.02% excess over the estimated contract value of ₹494.86 crore. Another bidder Larsen and Toubro, who participated in the tender process, quoted 4.8% excess over the estimated value. The Commissionerate of Tenders evaluated the tenders on Wednesday and, subsequently, the letter of acceptance was issued to the company on Thursday.

The tender process followed the sanction of ₹617 crore for construction of the integrated complex. The initial estimate for the complex replacing the old secretariat was enhanced by ₹100 crore from ₹400 crore to ₹500 crore. Thereafter, the government sanctioned ₹617 crore for construction works as more components were added. The scope for work has reportedly increased as the net site area increased by a little over one lakh square feet on account of addition of buildings proposed for staff amenities as well as electrical block while the total area has gone up from 25.42 acre to 28.05 acre.

With the government putting in place stringent norms for participating in the tender process, only two companies with track record in infrastructure development remained in the fray. The firms sought extension of the deadline for completion of the project by at least six months given the expansion of scope of work, but the government remained firm at the tender stage itself that the deadline for the completion of works would not be extended under any circumstances.

The selected bidder, sources said, assured the government that works would be taken up on continuous basis with holidays included so that the complex could be completed in all respects in one year’s time.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/shapoorji-pallonji-to-build-new-secretariat-complex/article32976194.ece

For incentivising usage of electric vehicles (EVs) in the State, Telangana government is proposing to exempt the first batch of two lakh such two-wheelers, 20,000 three-seater autorickshaws, 5,000 commercial passenger vehicles such as cabs and an equal number of private cars besides 500 buses from payment of road tax and registration fee.

A similar benefit will be provided to the first 10,000 light goods carriers, including goods carrying three-wheelers, and electric tractors.

The exemption will be applicable if the vehicles are purchased and registered within Telangana, said a government order on the Telangana Electric Vehicle & Energy Storage Policy 2020-2030.

Industries and IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao along with Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar is set to formally launch the policy on Friday at a programme, in which industry leaders are scheduled to participate.

Passed by the State Cabinet in August, the policy seeks to make Telangana a hub in the EV space through a combination of measure, including by offering incentives for manufacturing of EVs, energy storage systems and related components. The incentives will include capital subsidies, State GST reimbursements and power tariff subsidies.

With an eye on addressing the different facets of the EV ecosystem, the Policy said incentives will be provided for charging infrastructure. The government will facilitate setting of up initial batch of fast charging stations in Hyderabad and other towns in a phased manner by State entities and private players. It also moots a special power tariff category for EV charging stations, by the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission.

The GO said existing state self-employment schemes shall be extended to provide financial assistance for purchase of EVs for commercial purposes. Ride hailing services will be encouraged to operate electric 2, 3 and 4 wheelers through incentivisation. Promoting adoption of EVs at institutional level, starting with government entities, encouraging State Transport Units to purchase electric buses, and provision of preferential parking slots with required charging infrastructure for EVs are among the aspects touched by GO.

227,2020/10/29,Online transaction of non-farm properties in next 15-20 days: CM,"KCR launches Dharani portal for online transaction of agricultural properties

The State government is confident of launching online registration and mutation of non-agricultural properties in the next 15 to 20 days.

The online transactions of agricultural properties got under way on Thursday after Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao formally launched Dharani, the portal developed as part of the integrated land record management system. Online transactions related to non-agricultural properties are however likely to take about a fortnight more as the required software is being trial tested to ensure that no problems are encountered during the operation of the system.

“There will be difference in the software used for agricultural properties and non-agricultural ones. The non-agricultural properties will have multiple owners, for instance, apartment complexes with individual flats and therefore, it will take some more days for operationalisation of the new system,” the Chief Minister said.

95% land details in Dharani

Of the more than 1.48 crore acres of land across the State, details of 1.45 crore acre lands had already been hosted on the portal. Information of these lands, constituting more than 95% of the total area, could be accessed from anywhere across the globe. Adequate care was taken to ensure that government and forest, wakf and endowment properties were placed under the auto lock mode preventing any transactions relating to them.

Dharani to be trendsetter

Describing the new software as “trendsetter”, he acknowledged that implementation of a new system or new set of reforms which, he said, were “revolutionary” were bound to have some teething problems. But the government was committed to ensure that they would be addressed at the earliest and ensure that people would have hassle-free and transparent revenue administration. “It takes courage to take such decisions and implementation of Dharani reflects our commitment to the cause,” he said recalling how the government addressed problems related to power, drinking water and other issues which Telangana faced at the time of its formation.

The system would not give any scope for graft and the entire process would be based on biometric authentication. The finger print and key word of the mandal revenue officer concerned is must for opening up of the portal for transactions,” he said.

Mr. Rao said the government has decided to extend the last date for regularisation of the sada bainamas (land transaction on plain paper) by one more week following requests from the people. The government has received 1.64 lakh applications as on date and it has decided to extend the deadline in the interests of the people. “There will be no more Sada Bainamas in future. All the transactions will be through registration,” he averred.

Rythu Vedikas

He said the government would start inauguration of Rythu Vedikas that were constructed as platforms for farmers to exchange ideas about agriculture and related issues. Construction works pertaining to more that 95 per cent of the 2,601 Rythu Vedikas planned across the State had been completed and the remaining would be completed within few days.

The Chief Minister said he would himself inaugurate the Rythu Vedika at Kodakandla mandal headquarters in Jangaon district on October 31 and explain farmers about the importance of these platform.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/online-transaction-of-non-farm-properties-in-next-15-20-days-cm/article32975364.ece
228,2020/10/29,NGT asks AP not to go ahead with RLS without green nod,"‘It has component of irrigation, though not mentioned’

The National Green Tribunal (NGT), Southern Zone, has restrained Andhra Pradesh from going ahead with any work related to Rayalaseema Lift Scheme (RLS) planned by it without securing environmental clearance (EC) as it has found, prima facie, that “there is a component of irrigation envisaged in the project, which requires prior EC”.

In the 134-page judgment pronounced on Thursday by the Bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan, Judicial Member, and Saibal Dasgupta, Expert Member, the NGT also observed that since the Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS) has already directed the AP government not to proceed with the project without submitting the detailed project report (DPR) to the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB), constituted under the provisions of AP Reorganisation Act, for getting the appraisal done there is no necessity for the Tribunal to go into that aspect.

The Tribunal also was of the opinion that it is for the river board to decide whether its (river board’s) prior approval is required or not for the RLS as it has be considered by the board after evaluating the DPR. The judgment was delivered by Justice Ramakrishnan.

Disagreeing with the finding of the committee of experts of the Ministry of Environment and Forests that the project proposed by AP does not require prior EC as it does not attract the provisions of Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006. The tribunal agreed with the submissions of the counsel for the petitioner, one Gavinolla Srinivas from Narayanpet district, Sravan Kumar and Additional Advocate General of Telangana J. Ramachandra Rao that the scheme has been framed in such a way to avoid the process of obtaining EC in the guise of drinking water project, although it is intended for irrigation purpose as well.

‘Prepare DPR’

The counsel for the petitioner and Telangana government have also submitted that the actual purpose could be ascertained only if the DPR is prepared and impact assessment study is carried out on the basis of the DPR, the Tribunal said in its judgement.

Observing that there is change in the scope of the project, even if RLS is considered as expansion or supplementary project, since it seeks to draw water from 800 feet level of Srisailam reservoir against 854 feet level for existing projects — Telugu Ganga, Srisailam Right Bank Canal, Galeru-Nagari, drinking water to Chennai and supplementation to to K.C. Canal — and “it is very difficult to accept the view of the expert committee changing of water drawing level with lift pumping facility will not have any impact”.

Quantity required

The RLS which also includes the proposal to enhance the water drawal capacity of Pothireddypadu Head Regulator from the existing 44,000 cusecs to 80,000 cusecs but the AP government has not mentioned as to how much water is required for drinking purposes in Rayalaseema region and “what they propose to do with the remaining water that is to be drawn in excess of the present capacity”, the NGT said adding that earlier projects drawing water from Pothireddypadu have the component of irrigation as well.

“This Tribunal is of the view that the scheme is framed in such a way to come to the conclusion that it is only for drinking water purpose and no irrigation component is added so as to avoid the exercise of getting EC as required under EIA Notification and it (the Tribunal) is entitled to lift the veil off the project,” the NGT said in its judgment. Its impact on agriculture (irrigation) even if it is intended for the purpose of overcoming drought situations is not mentioned in the scheme and it could be ascertained only with proper evaluation, the Tribunal felt.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/fco4c6/article32975113.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY30SRISAILAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ngt-asks-ap-not-to-go-ahead-with-rls-without-green-nod/article32975114.ece
229,2020/10/29,"Call to increase awareness on stroke, its effects","Stroke is 4th leading cause of death, 5th leading cause of disability, say doctors

On World Stroke Day, observed on October 29, neurologists and heads of corporate hospitals in Hyderabad have stressed the importance of making people aware about symptoms of the stroke, rushing patients to hospital in the ‘golden hour’, to avoid disability or death.

Neurologist at Aster Prime Hospitals Sindhu Vasireddy said that stroke is a condition where the blood supplies to the brain is disrupted, resulting in oxygen starvation, brain damage and loss of function. It is most frequently caused by a clot in an artery supplying blood to the brain, a situation known as ischemia. It can also be caused by haemorrhage when a vessel bursts leading blood to leak into the brain. Around 80% of strokes are ischemic.

“The main symptoms of stroke can be remembered and checked with the word FAST — Face – is the face drooping to one side, Arms – is there a weakness in one arm or leg, Speech – is speech slurred or garbled, Time – if these symptoms are present it is time to call emergency services,” Dr. Sindhu said.

Advisor and senior consultant in Neurology at Apollo Super Specialty Hospitals Satish Chandra said that stroke is fourth leading cause of death, fifth leading cause of disability in our country. It is three times more common in urban localities compared to rural areas. He said that slogan should be ‘Spot Stroke – Stop Stroke’.

Managing director of Yashoda Group of Hospitals G. S. Rao said that close to one-fifth of first-time stroke patients were aged 40 years or less. “The common risk factors — hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and dyslipidemia — are quite prevalent and inadequately controlled mainly because of poor public awareness and inadequate infrastructure. We are the first in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to have introduced ‘Stroke Care on Wheels’ which helps in providing specialized, brain-saving care to stroke victims before they even get to the hospital,” Dr. Rao said.

Speaking about thrombolysis, neuro-interventional radiologist at Yashoda Hospital Suresh Giragani, said that clot dissolving drugs can help open the blockage and the affected artery, and if used within three to four-and-half hours after the onset of the stroke — the ‘Golden Period’ — damage to damage to brain cells can be prevented and aid in recovery.

Apollo Hospitals Group on Thursday announced a partnership with India Medtronic Private Limited to integrate Artificial intelligence (AI) for advanced stroke management.

The AI software will provide automated analysis in less than two minutes, enabling faster decision making in stroke cases, where every second counts.

“Through this partnership, Medtronic will help in bringing in stroke technologies, technical expertise, training and comprehensive stroke management with the integration of AI platform at the Apollo Institute of Neurosciences at 10 locations in Apollo Hospitals across the country, taking stroke management to the next level by standardizing stroke diagnosis and empowering clinicians to make faster, more accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions,” according to a press release.

Chairman of the Apollo Hospitals Group Prathap C. Reddy said that there is an urgent need to improve the treatment and management of stroke using digital technologies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/call-to-increase-awareness-on-stroke-its-effects/article32975000.ece

High ranking officials from the Forest and Police departments of Telangana, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh participated in a one-day workshop on forest protection, timber smuggling, tiger conservation, growth of wildlife habitats and inter-State coordination at Bhupalapally on Thursday.

The officials have decided with the common aim of protecting Godavari river basin, wildlife conservation and prevention of timber smuggling.

The discussions mainly focused on the measures already being taken up at the Tadoba, Indravati and Kawal tiger reserves, as well as the measures that have to be taken up in view of increasing number of migrating tigers.

Resolutions have been taken up for tightening security, setting up control rooms on both sides, increasing vigilance through joint patrolling, meeting frequently, creating WhatsApp groups with joint executives of the states, and setting up of base camps in requisite areas to crack down upon timber smuggling.

Tiger sighting at Mulugu, Bhupalapally and Pedddapally areas has assumed importance in the meeting, and Inspector General of Forest (IGF), NTCA regional office, N.S.Murali has assured more funds to the Telangana Forest department in view of the possibility of development of forests where the tiger has made its appearance.

PCCF and Head of Forest Forces R.Sobha represented the State, while Chief Conservator M.J. Akbar of Warangal Range presided as the coordinator of the workshop.

State unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party has demanded that Election Observer (law and order) sent by the Election Commission to oversee the bye-election to Dubbak Assembly seat take immediate action against the police officials playing a “partisan role” to favour the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) Party.

In a memorandum submitted to the Election Observer on Thursday, party in-charge for the Dubbak byelection and former MP Jithender Reddy, national executive member N. Indrasena Reddy, election cell in-charge Antony Reddy, charged the police officials with continuing to harass the party leaders and cadre and keeping them from campaigning.

Many party workers are being summoned to the police stations without any rhyme or reason and are being warned that if they continue to participate in the electioneering for the BJP candidate, their families will be deprived of government welfare benefits including pensions, they alleged.

The party leaders also recounted the recent incidents of raids on the home of party candidate Raghunandan Rao, preventing party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar from reaching Siddipet and disregarding the norms to be followed with regard to a Member of Parliament and how he was forcibly transported back to Karimnagar under police watch.

All these point to a clear backing of the ruling party under the direction of Minister for Finance T. Harish Rao so as to win the election by hook or crook.

232,2020/10/29,Monuments and music,"Architecture and music have long shared a close romance. A look at the relationship between these two art forms down the ages

Emperor Ashoka’s rock edicts are the inspiration for T.M. Krishna’s latest work. Though the inspiration is epigraphical and not architectural, ‘The Edict Project’ obliquely recalled for me the long and intertwined history of music and architecture.

While the musicality of Krishna’s project seems forced, architecture and music have long inspired and informed one another in myriad ways, linked as they are by rhythm, proportion, harmony, and the emotional effects they have on their audience. Indeed, terms and disciplines like ‘sound architecture’ and ‘music archaeology’ are ample proof of their overlap and mutuality. Their correlation is best enshrined in a dictum attributed to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: ‘Music is liquid architecture; architecture is frozen music’.

But the affair goes back way beyond Goethe. In fact, the first interconnections can be traced back to ancient Greece, where Greek temples and coliseums were designed to proportional principles that would not only create supreme architectural beauty but also reveal ‘the music of the heavenly spheres’. Often built around musical performances, these ancient Greek structures were created with the best acoustic environments. Similar traditions followed in grand European cathedrals such as the one at Notre Dame in Paris. The ceremonial architecture was intended to mirror and complement the liturgical activities of the Christian church, and also reflect its power. Medieval Europe was full of instances of what may be called architectural polyphony.

The Colosseum in Rome.

In fact, Greek philosophers were already wondering if the ‘colours’ of music could be quantified. And Isaac Newton suggested that musical notes and the tones of colour might share common frequencies, something Goethe too discussed in his book, Theory of Colours.

Closer home, the stone masons and sthapatis of ancient India created some glorious examples of the congruence of the two arts. Many ancient south Indian temples such as the Vijaya Vittala temple in Hampi, Karnataka; Lepakshi temple in Andhra Pradesh; and Nellaiappar temple, Alwarthirunagari temple, and Adi Kumbeswarar temple in Tamil Nadu have extraordinary stone pillars that emit musical notes when struck.

The Nellaiappar Temple

In fact, the Indian sculptural traditions use the cchanda (poetic meter) principle of scaling while many forms of Indian music have the meru (vertical elevation) principle of scaling, showing how these disciplines often mirror each other.

Like most histories, those of music and architecture also start against sacred backgrounds. Before the secularisation of music, most of it was created for religious purposes to be performed in religious spaces. However, both arts have long transcended those boundaries and are now found in ordinary and everyday contexts. And when architecture and music are used in tandem, some remarkable works of art are born.

The illuminated musical pillars at Vijaya Vittala temple, Hampi

In the picturisation of the song ‘Let it go’ from the animated film Frozen (2013), Elsa builds a magical ice castle to the tune of her song, raising a wall, a column, a spire with every note of her voice.

Music and space are intertwined in many such examples from pop music such as ‘Brick by Brick’ by Train (2009), and ‘Palaces’ by Nelly Furtado (2017), to name a couple. Last year, the German indie rock band, LIONLION, released a music video for their song ‘Oceans Rise’, which was inspired by the Bauhaus style of architecture. The reduced, minimalistic design vocabulary of the video reflects the famous German school that celebrated its centenary in 2019.

In 1995, Grammy-winning American blues performer Henry Saint Claire Fredericks, whose stage name is Taj Mahal, teamed with Vishwa Mohan Bhatt on the mohan veena and N. Ravikiran on the chitravina to record the album titled ‘Mumtaz Mahal’.

For Chicago’s Access Contemporary Music company, architecture-inspired music is serious, regular business. Each year, they commission composers to create works based on the city’s most remarkable spaces such as the Carr Chapel, the Union Station, International Museum of Surgical Science, Sedgwick Studio, and the Elks National Memorial. The commissioned works are collated for a performance during Open House Chicago, an annual weekend where citizens tour those buildings while listening to the music pieces that inspired them.

Such collaborations come closest to that perceptual phenomenon called synaesthesia, where one “sees” a note or “hears” a colour. And the rich permutations from such intersections can be endless if we keep our minds open to the possibilities.

233,2020/10/29,Looking back at public transport through a photo series,"People from all walks of life reminisce about public transport in their city, through Chennai Photo Biennale’s #TicketToRide initiative

The window bars arrange themselves into a geometrically satisfying grid as two heads pop out, anticipating an update on why the train has halted. A regular sight captured on a whim during a train ride to Gokarna, this is one of Shruti Parthasarathy’s most cherished photographs.

A mixed media frame, on the other hand, shows the Chennai GPO towering behind the illustration of an auto-rickshaw by Shiva Kumar.

Such unique frames confirm that the most missed aspect in the ‘new normal’ is the hustle and bustle of public transport. Chennai Photo Biennale’s arts learning initiative CPB Prism (@cpbprism) recently launched a hashtag-led open call on Instagram #TicketToRide, in collaboration with Storytrails, to encourage people to look back and reminisce. Though they have closed the campaign, the 50-odd entries received had interesting stories (from Lisbon to Chennai) to tell.

For instance, Sneha’s frame of a lady, her hair adorned with flowers, in a moving bus invokes a sense of nostalgia for those days when all of us were scrambling for time in a busy world.

“We wanted to initiate something positive.We had earlier done #InAugustCompany, also an open call, where people were asked to share photos taken during the lockdown. After that, we were thinking of how else people can connect to photography in the lockdown,” says Sakshi Shraddha, education programme coordinator at CPB Prism, adding, “We realised that everybody has been missing public transport.”

During the lockdowns, its importance was appreciated more as many struggled to get to their workplaces or move about. Apart from that, buses and trains are meeting spots for friends everyday.

“Now, we know how much we actually need them and what happens when we don’t have them,” says Sakshi.

Since it is still not entirely safe to use public transport now, they encouraged people to send photographs from their archives. “We also wanted them to tell the story behind the pictures. When they look back at these images, the memories come rushing back.This was another way in which we wanted them to reflect on public transport and realise its contribution that they might have failed to notice before,” adds Sakshi. In addition to personal stories, historical trivia on the location dug up by Storytrails, is also featured.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/g8hjox/article32971933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MPSneha4TicketToRide,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/public-transport-is-the-subject-for-this-photo-series/article32971937.ece

The Income-Tax (I-T) Department searches against a Bijnor-based group in the real estate business and its associates in Uttar Pradesh have led to the detection of over 20 companies that were running from a single premises. A London property linked to one of the suspects has also been identified.

During the searches, which started on Wednesday, the agency has so far found “unexplained cash” of over ₹50 lakh and jewellery weighing about 2.5 kg.

There were allegations that the group companies were having huge security premium reserves and massive liabilities in the form of loans and advances from related parties and others, and even then they had advanced substantial loans to others. The sales of the group were not commensurate with the loans and advances shown, said the agency in a release on Thursday.

The companies identified during the probe did not have any worth, but they were showing significant amounts of share premium. “The dummy companies are being used as conduit for layering of funds,” said the Department.

According to the agency, one of the group members had financial interest in a United Kingdom-based foreign company and one property in London, and the sources of investment therein are being examined.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/i-t-dept-detects-over-20-entities-running-from-same-address-in-bijnor/article32975962.ece
235,2020/10/29,Dhankhar’s remarks after meeting Shah trigger fresh war of words,"Interestingly, a section of Left and Congress leaders also criticise his utterances

West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar meeting Union Home Minister Amit Shah and his subsequent remarks on the law and order situation in the State on Thursday once again triggered strong reactions from the West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress.

Also read: Not being given information on a host of issues, says Bengal Governor

Interestingly, a section of the Left and Congress leaders also criticised the utterances of the Governor, saying such utterances did not go with the high office he occupied.

After meeting Mr. Shah, Mr Dhankhar said, “How can a constitutional head have a sound sleep when the State is sliding into lawlessness”. His accusations included that the “police and administration were politicized” and the rule of law not being restored. “I am not a stakeholder in politics. It is not my concern who gets elected. But it is my concern how elections take place,” he said.

The remarks prompted speculations about imposition of Article 356 in the State where Assembly polls are scheduled next year.

When Mr. Shah was not in favour of President’s rule and Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh also did not want President’s rule, why was the Governor impressing on this, Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy asked.

Another Trinamool Congress leader and Minister Partha Chatterjee said Mr. Dhankhar’s utterances were like a spokesperson of the BJP. “He is accusing the police and administration of being politically motivated, is his conduct outside the ambit of politics?”. If the Governor had to make such comments on a daily basis “what is preventing him from joining active politics”, he added.

Several other party leaders, including MP Kalyan Banerjee, took to social media to criticise the Governor.

A section of the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders accused him of “compromising” his position. Congress MP Pradip Bhattacharya and CPI(M) leader Samik Bhattacharya were among those who said his regular utterances were not befitting to his high office.

Recently, the State unit of the CPI(M) has expressed its disapproval on Mr. Dhankhar putting up photographs of an ailing veteran communist leader Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, whose residence he had visited to offer greetings during Durga Puja.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8c5w8v/article32975110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30TH-JAGDEEP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dhankhars-remarks-after-meeting-shah-trigger-fresh-war-of-words/article32975111.ece
236,2020/10/29,Shutdown called by student body hits life in Manipur,"Chief Minister N. Biren Singh said the protest was not acceptable as the COVID-19 pandemic had left the people struggling.

A 48-hour shutdown called by the All Manipur Muslim Students’ Organisation and some other groups from Thursday morning to demand 4% reservation for Muslims in education affected life in the State. There was a face-off between students and the police at several places.

Activists alleged that some officers used unprintable words while handling Muslim women activists and demanded action against them.

Chief Minister N. Biren Singh said the protest was not acceptable as the COVID-19 pandemic had left the people struggling. Some student leaders said that if the Chief Minister gave an assurance on the demands, they would consider calling off the strike.

On Wednesday night, Muslim women took out a torchlight procession at Sangai Yumpham in Thoubal. Volunteers blocked traffic on Thursday by burning old tyres and logs. A vehicle of a former Minister was damaged in stone-throwing. Some policemen tried to disperse those who blocked the main road at Hatta Minuthong near Imphal. But the protesters outnumbered the policemen, who took shelter in a house.

Leaders of six students’ organisations who have been observing a relay fast denied the Chief Minister’s statement on their campaign to demand a policy for tackling COVID-19. Mr. Biren Singh said earlier in the day that most of their demands had been met and the rest would be addressed after talks with Sapam Ranjan, his health adviser.

However, N. Edison, president of DESAM, a students’ organisation, said, “No such agreement has been reached. One of the 12 demands made by the students’ organisation is that there be a Health Minister. We feel that Mr. Biren Singh who holds several portfolios cannot pay full attention to the fight against COVID-19.”

But Mr. Biren Singh said, “I appointed Sapam Ranjan as health adviser to me. We are doing well as a team.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2vzzqg/article32344517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIRENSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/shutdown-called-by-student-body-hits-life-in-manipur/article32975062.ece
237,2020/10/29,ED attaches more assets in Afroz Fatta case,"The properties include a flat in Mumbai, five shops and another flat in Surat, besides bank balance, which belong to textile trader Bilal Haroon Galani.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached assets worth ₹1.80 crore in a bogus import case involving alleged “hawala” operator Afroz Mohammed Hasanfatta and others, taking the value of total attachment to over ₹42 crore.

The properties include a flat in Mumbai, five shops and another flat in Surat, besides bank balance, which belong to textile trader Bilal Haroon Galani, said the ED.

The probe is based on a complaint received by the Surat Crime Branch from the ICICI Bank against R.A. Distributors Private Limited and others, alleging that some companies had submitted fake bills of entry for illegal outward remittances.

Identification of 9 companies

The money laundering investigation led to the identification of nine companies that illegally remitted huge amounts of money to three companies in the United Arab Emirates and 15 others in Hong Kong, it is alleged.

The main sources of funds in these accounts were eight entities, apart from about 470 others. The eight entities received money through various cheque discounters and a web of 2,700 companies. The ED alleges that Afroz Fatta, Madanlal Jain, Galani, Jayesh Desai and Rakesh Kothari were involved in the racket. “These accused persons created shell companies using dummy persons as directors/partners,” it said in a release.

During investigation, the ED found that Galani had also allegedly earned commission for his role in the illegal foreign remittances using banking channels. The proceeds were routed through bank accounts and later used for purchasing properties, said the agency.

The ED had arrested Afroz Fatta and four other accused persons.

240,2020/10/29,Kolkata International Film Festival rescheduled to be held in January 2021,"It will now be held from Jan 8-15. Let the preparations begin, says Mamata Banerjee

The West Bengal government has rescheduled the Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF) this year in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said the 26th edition will be held from January 8 to 15, 2021.

It will now be held from Jan 8-15, 2021. Let the preparations begin!,” Ms. Banerjee said on social media.

The festival started in 1995 during the regime of the Left Front government and 25 editions have so far been organised by the Information and Cultural Affairs department. After the Trinamool Congress came to power in 2011, the budget of the festival was increased and it started drawing stars from Bollywood along with well-known names from Bengali cinema. In 2019, Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan inaugurated the festival. Amitabh Bachchan and other well-known actors have also been regulars.

The KIFF also offers one of the highest cash awards for filmmakers with ₹51 lakh for the best film and ₹21 lakh for the lakh best director. Usually, it is held in October-November after the Durga Puja festival. This year the festival is likely to be go online with the norms of physical distancing.

241,2020/10/29,NHRC asks Odisha to submit report on rehabilitation of Hirakud Dam oustees,"A plea by a lawyer has claimed incomplete rehabilitation of 26,561 displaced families

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has asked the Odisha government to submit a report on non-receipt of compensation by people who were displaced by the Hirakud Dam project — one of the oldest unresolved problems of displacement in the country.

The rights panel asked the Chief Secretary to submit the report by December 7.

Human rights lawyer Radhakanta Tripathy had moved the NHRC drawing its attention to incomplete rehabilitation of 26,561 families displaced for construction of the Hirakud Dam project. The land for the mega project was acquired during 1952-53.

After the NHRC’s intervention, the Revenue Divisional Commissioner, Northern Division of Odisha, submitted that steps were taken from time to time to redress grievances of the displaced families who belonged to four districts — Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, Bargarh and Subarnapur.

“The issues with regard to DC [Deputy Commissioner] patta, payment of ex gratia, homestead land, settlement of agriculture land and basic amenities stand settled. As on date, no case of rehabilitation is pending,” the RDC had submitted to the NHRC.

The RDC, however, admitted that certain service groups of people, including Jhankar, Chowkidar, Nariha. Dhoba and Bhandari were not awarded full compensation and were yet to be rehabilitated.

“Without proper rehabilitation and compensation more than 26,000 families have been displaced for the construction of Hirakud Dam project. The project has submerged more than 360 villages covering more than 1,23,000 acres of land and displaced more than one lakh people. About seventy years have passed, even the third generation of the victims could not get justice due to the corrupt and lethargic bureaucracy,” Mr. Tripathy alleged.

The issue drew attention after the investigation report of NHRC Special Rapporteur B.B.

242,2020/10/29,Fresh unrest on Assam-Mizoram border,"Officials in Assam said non-withdrawal of Mizoram Police from disputed territory reason behind local anger

The boundary dispute between Assam and Mizoram has flared up again after a brief lull.

Locals in southern Assam’s Cachar and Karimganj districts on Wednesday blocked the roads to Mizoram to leave more than 100 goods-laden trucks stranded. The blockade to protest the alleged refusal of Mizoram Police personnel to withdraw from Assam’s territory continued on Thursday.

Officials in Assam said people of Mizoram, allegedly backed by local authorities and NGOs, have encroached upon large swathes of area in Cachar and Karimganj districts. The two States share a 164.6 km border.

“We are trying to defuse the tension after locals made the non-withdrawal of Mizoram Police from Assam territory an issue. Our officials are on the job trying to convince them,” Cachar’s Deputy Commissioner Keerthi Jalli said.

Officials in southern Assam said the Mizoram Police had promised to withdraw a week ago, following which trucks carrying essentials started moving on National Highway 306, the lifeline of Mizoram.

The fresh unrest made Assam’s Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) G.P. Singh visit the border area on Wednesday. He discussed ways to de-escalate tension with the local authorities on either side of the border, including Vanlalfaka Ralte, the Superintendent of Police of Mizoram’s Kolasib district adjoining Assam.

“Our investigation shows miscreants from Mizoram could be involved in the violence and arson along the border. Since the cases are under the purview of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, we have decided to transfer the probe to a Central agency,” he said.

Officials in Mizoram said the governments of the two States were trying to find a way to ensure peace along the border.

The situation on the border took an ugly turn on October 17 after some 20 shops and houses were burnt and more than 50 people injured in attacks and counter-attacks by people on either side. A Bengali medium school was later bombed.

Meanwhile, the indefinite economic blockade from Thursday, called by traders, transporters and local NGOs in Assam against Meghalaya, has been called off. This followed a meeting between the Deputy Commissioners and Superintendents of Police of western Assam’s Goalpara and Meghayala’s North Garo Hills district on Wednesday.

“We called off the blockade after Meghalaya officials informed us about the revised standard operating procedures and easing of travel restrictions for people from Assam and other States if COVID-19 protocols are adhered to,” a leader of the local unit of the All Assam Students’ Union said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fresh-unrest-on-assam-mizoram-border/article32973502.ece
243,2020/10/29,Meghalaya woman who resisted uranium mining dies at 95,"Spility Lyngdoh Langrin mobilised opposition to Uranium Corporation’s plans in the 1990s

Spility Lyngdoh Langrin, the face of resistance to uranium mining in Meghalaya, passed away on Wednesday night. She was 95, members of her family in the uranium-rich Domïasiat area of South West Khasi Hills district said on Thursday.

Ms. Langrin became a household name when she rejected a lucrative offer from the government to buy her land after the Atomic Minerals Directorate had undertaken an exploratory drilling for uranium deposits in 1993. “Money cannot buy me freedom,” she had said — to eventually motivate locals against the “environmental ills” of uranium mining.

In 2009, the State government granted permission to the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) to undertake exploratory activities on 422 hectares in South West Khasi Hills district. The State was then estimated to have 9.22 million tonnes of high-grade uranium ore deposits.

Relentless protests by the locals, wary of the effects of uranium mining in Jharkhand’s Jaduguda, made the government revoke the permission in August 2016.

The Khasi Students’ Union, which had backed Ms. Langrin’s resistance, mourned her death. “The matriarch who withstood the onslaught of UCIL and its agents to forcibly mine uranium in Meghalaya has departed from us. May her soul rest in peace,” it said in a statement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/meghalaya-woman-who-resisted-uranium-mining-dies-at-95/article32973374.ece
244,2020/10/29,Mayawati suspends 7 MLAs for rebelling,"The former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh said her party will vote for BJP or any other party’s candidate to ensure defeat of SP candidates.

Accusing the Samajwadi Party (SP) of trying to break away her MLAs, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Thursday vowed to ensure the defeat of the SP candidate in the MLC polls in Uttar Pradesh, even if it meant that her party legislators would have to vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The new phase of acrimony between the two parties comes a year after they contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election together.

The BSP chief also suspended seven of her MLAs — more than a third of her total strength in the Assembly — for their alleged rebellion in withdrawing support to her Rajya Sabha candidate Ramji Gautam’s nomination and their alleged meeting with Akhilesh Yadav. She said she also regretted forming an alliance with the SP in 2019 and withdrawing the case in the 1995 guest house attack, calling them both “wrong decisions” hastily taken.

In a “tit for tat” for breaking away her MLAs and trying to get the nomination of BSP’s Rajya Sabha candidate rejected, Ms. Mayawati said that she would use all her force to ensure the defeat of the second candidate the SP would field in the MLC polls.

The BSP would ensure the SP’s defeat “even if our MLAs have to vote for a candidate of the BJP or any other party,” she said.

The seven suspended BSP MLAs are Chaudhary Aslam Ali, Hargovind Bhargav, Mohammad Mujtaba Siddiqui, Hakim Lal Bind, Mohammad Aslam Raini, Sushma Patel and Vandana Singh. Four of them who had proposed the name of the BSP candidate for the RS polls withdrew support and claimed that their signatures had been forged.

The BSP had fielded Mr. Gautam even though it does not have enough numbers in the Assembly to ensure his win but was banking on the support of the other parties and possibly the BJP, which had announced eight candidates, as alleged by the SP.

The SP re-nominated Ram Gopal Yadav. The elections are being held for 10 seats.

The confrontation was set after an 11th candidate, Prakash Bajaj, an independent and industrialist allegedly backed by the SP, also filed his nomination at the last moment, which was perceived to be a move by the SP to thwart the BSP candidate’s chances. But his papers were rejected, while Mr. Gautam’s were accepted.

Ms. Mayawati said the “anti-Dalit” face of the SP was exposed by the episode — the BSP candidate is a Dalit — and dismissed the allegations that she was in collusion with the BJP.

Ms. Mayawati justified fielding a candidate despite not having the required numbers in the house of 403, saying that she took the step after SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav informed her colleague S.C. Mishra that the SP would not be fielding a second candidate.

Comment | Mayawati's blurred political vision

Abhishek Mishra, SP secretary, shot back at Ms. Mayawati and said that her comments about ensuring the defeat of the SP in the MLC polls with BJP support “proves she was working as a BJP B team”. Mr. Mishra also reminded Ms. Mayawati, who accused the SP of letting down the alliance in 2019, that it was only because of his party that “the party [BSP] that had zero seats got 10 seats”.

Curiously, though the seven suspended BSP MLAs spoke against the BSP coordinators, they did not react adversely to Ms. Mayawati herself and claimed they had no plans of joining any other party. “We are not going to any other party. We will continue to remain in the party. We welcome the decision of the supremo. It is her prerogative,” said MLA Aslam Raini.

Barring one, Sushma Patel of Jaunpur, the others dismissed reports of them meeting Akhilesh Yadav amid speculation that they would shift loyalties.

Ms. Patel said she had no intention of rebelling against the BSP. “In politics, meeting someone is not a crime. I was not involved in any cross voting nor violated any whip,” she told a TV channel.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ytobgj/article32972993.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mayawati-suspends-seven-rebel-mlas/article32972994.ece
245,2020/10/29,"Uttarakhand CM graft row | Considering filing defamation case against scribe, says Harendra Rawat","The retired professor asserted that he and his wife were not even remotely related to the Chief Minister.

Retired professor Harendra Rawat, who has been accused by a journalist of having received money from a man in Jharkhand for Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, on Thursday said he was considering filing a defamation case against the scribe.

He also asserted that he and his wife were not even remotely related to the Chief Minister.

Terming the allegations made against him and his wife by journalist Umesh Sharma through a social media post as “unfounded”, Harendra Rawat said they have not only hurt the image of his family but also that of the Chief Minister.

The retired professor, who is recuperating after a heart surgery, said he was hurt at the damage done to his reputation and was seriously considering filing a defamation case against Umesh Sharma.

Posting a video on social media on June 24, the journalist had alleged that a man named Amritesh Chauhan from Jharkhand had deposited money into the accounts of the retired professor and his wife post demonetisation for the personal benefit of the CM.

It was also claimed in the post that the retired professor’s wife Savita Rawat was the sister of the Chief Minister’s wife Sunita Rawat.

Details of the bank transaction had also been shared in the post in support of the charges. The retired professor had filed an FIR against journalist Sharma on July 31, terming the charges as “false” and “unfounded”.

He said he had also requested the police to conduct a thorough probe into the matter by a Special Investigation Team. Defending himself, Harendra Rawat said he had also got all his family’s bank accounts checked and they showed no monetary transaction from Jharkhand.

Expressing surprise and anger, the retired professor wondered how the journalist got details of his bank accounts and how the latter made them public on social media.

“I cannot say anything against the banks but I wonder how personal details were shared,” he said.

On asked why his name was dragged into the case, Harendra Rawat said it was a matter of investigation, adding that he may have been targeted as he was advisor to Trivendra Singh Rawat when the latter was Agriculture Minister in 2011.

The Samajwadi Party has objected to red and green tiles being used at a toilet at a railway hospital here and said it was an insult to its flag bearing the same colours.

247,2020/10/29,"Two out of five Srinagar residents have COVID-19 antibodies, sero-survey shows","A sero-survey involves testing the blood serum of individuals to check for the prevalence of antibodies against an infection

Over 40% people living in Srinagar district have developed COVID-19 antibodies, claims a latest sero-prevalence survey conducted by a government hospital here, the results of which were questioned by the district administration citing small sample size of the study.

The results of the study conducted by the Government Medical College Srinagar (GMC) show a quantum jump from 3.8% sero-prevalence recorded in a similar study conducted in the city in June, and suggests that a large fraction of the population in the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir may have been infected by the novel coronavirus.

A sero-survey involves testing the blood serum of individuals to check for the prevalence of antibodies against an infection.

“We have conducted a sero-survey in Srinagar district which has revealed that over 40 per cent of the 2,400 persons tested negative but had developed antibodies,” said Dr. Muhammad Salim Khan, head of community medicine at GMC Srinagar.

Dr. Khan noted that the samples were taken randomly from 20 clusters in Srinagar district which also showed higher prevalence of antibodies in the female population than males.

However, officials said the results should be interpreted with caution due to its small sample size.

“The sample survey was only 2,400 in a population of around 15 lakh. In order to get an accurate picture, the sample size should have been more, an official said.

Giving details, the official said that earlier Srinagar had witnessed 18% of positivity rate for COVID-19 when the testing capacity was around 60,000.

“However, when testing capacity was increased to 4 Lakh, the rate of positive patients in Srinagar was only 18,000,” the official said.

The official noted that the survey results could be misconstrued, and can lead to complacency among the people.

“The trend is encouraging but there is no way we can say that COVID-19 will be defeated at a certain level of population by developing the antibodies. The scientific community is also wary of using the term herd immunity in the absence of a vaccine,” he added.

Herd immunity occurs when a large number of people, usually 70 to 90%, become immune to a contagious disease after being infected by it.

But there are many grey areas clouding the issue as far as the novel coronavirus is concerned with no consensus on when herd immunity sets in.

Srinagar has been the worst affected district by COVID-19 in Jammu and Kashmir with nearly 19,000 persons infected so far and 348 deaths due to the pandemic.

The district has 1,651 active cases as compared to 5,300 in the remaining 19 districts of the union territory.

Mr. Khan said a wider sero-survey is underway across the remaining nine districts of Kashmir valley where 400 samples have been collected from each district.

“The results are expected to come within two weeks from now,” he added.

248,2020/10/29,Ex-MP Annu Tandon quits Cong. blaming ‘misalignment’ between her and U.P. unit,"U.P. Congress leadership is ‘focused only on social media management and self-branding’, she says in her letter to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi

Former Unnao MP Annu Tandon on Thursday resigned from the Congress, stating that there was a “misalignment” between her and its Uttar Pradesh unit.

This comes as a blow to the party which is already short of State leaders.

In a resignation letter addressed to UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, Ms. Tandon said, “Unfortunately, there is a misalignment between the State leadership and me and I do not see their support in allowing me to work since the past several months.”

She accused the U.P. Congress leadership of being “focused only on social media management and self-branding” and claimed it was “oblivious of the deep divisions in the party and the voters it has thus caused.”

“Spreading canards about my associates and in Unnao and me, by the local irrelevant and chosen few, to get brownie points despite my genuine intent is painful, rather quite disgusting with no attempt or endeavour by the party leadership to stem this,” Ms. Tandon said.

She, however, said that she received warmth and guidance under the leadership of Mr. Gandhi and former party president Rahul Gandhi and never had difficulty in access.

“My ideology and principles have been aligned with the senior leadership of the party and my resignation does not change them,” she stated.

The ex-MP has not indicated if she would join any particular party but said she would consult her workers about any future step.

Ms. Tandon was elected as MP from Unnao in 2009. However, she lost both the 2014 and 2019 elections, standing a distant fourth and third respectively.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/y7dk46/article32971330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANNUTANDON-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ex-mp-annu-tandon-quits-cong-blaming-misalignment-between-her-and-up-unit/article32971331.ece
249,2020/10/29,TRP racket case | Mumbai court grants bail to Fakt Marathi channel owner,"Shirish Pattanshetty claims he never paid any money for rigging the rating points

A city civil and sessions court on Thursday granted bail to Shirish Pattanshetty, owner of Fakt Marathi channel, in the Television Rating Point (TRP) manipulation case.

Mr. Pattanshetty, 44, was arrested on October 8, and has been granted bail by additional sessions judge P.R. Sitre on a bond of ₹50,000 after it was rejected by the Esplanade magistrate court.

Fake TRP case | Republic TV, Arnab Goswamy move Bombay High Court to quash FIR

An FIR was registered against him under Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120 B (punishment of criminal conspiracy), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

Mr. Pattanshetty’s lawyer Aniket Nikam said his client had not done any rigging of TRPs nor there was a rise in the TRPs of the channel. Even the revenue of the channel had not increased during the relevant period. This was a witch-hunt, the lawyer said.

His bail application mentions, “The channel is the only free to air channel among all Marathi channels. There is no exponential rise in the TRPs of the channel during the period alleged in the FIR.”

The plea also stated, “Mr. Pattanshetty never paid any money to anybody for rigging the TRPs. If the prosecution case was that he paid money for TRPs, then the TRPs of his channel should have increased. However, on the contrary, both the TRPs and the revenues of Fakt Marathi channel have dipped from November 2019 to May 2020.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/1u4tug/article32864160.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRPjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/trp-scam-mumbai-court-grants-bail-to-fakt-marathi-channel-owner/article32971233.ece
250,2020/10/29,Supreme Court stays Uttarakhand High Court nod for CBI probe against Uttarakhand CM,"‘Order for CBI investigation too drastic’

The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed a Uttarakhand High Court order directing a CBI probe into corruption allegations against Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat.

A Bench, led by Justice Ashok Bhushan, said it was too “drastic” for the High Court to have passed such an order without giving Mr. Rawat an opportunity of hearing.

Attorney General K.K. Venugopal, appearing for Mr. Rawat, said the order “caught everyone by surprise” and was against the principles of natural justice.

The case pertains to corruption allegations levelled by two journalists —Umesh Sharma and Shiv Prasad Semwal — pertaining to money transferred allegedly into the accounts of relatives of Mr. Rawat in 2016 to support appointment of a person as head of “Gau Seva Ayog” of Jharkhand when he was the in-charge of Jharkhand BJP unit.

Justice Bhushan said even the State was not arraigned as a party before the court.

Mr. Venugopal said the order could even unsettle the government. The top law officer said the Chief Minister was bound to be heard.

The High Court was entirely wrong in law when it said that it could direct lodging of an FIR without hearing the party. The High Court cannot be oblivious that it would result in the unsettling of the government, Mr. Venugopal argued.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the two journalists, said he was not opposing the stay order but there was ample evidence in support of the corruption allegation against Mr. Rawat.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/b886iu/article28739553.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAWAT-UTTARAKHAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sc-stays-hc-order-for-cbi-probe-against-uttarakhand-cm-on-corruption-allegations/article32971170.ece
251,2020/10/29,Former Gujarat CM Keshubhai Patel passes away,"He recently recovered from COVID-19.

Former Gujarat Chief Minister and a stalwart who played a key role in building the BJP in Gujarat, Keshubhai Patel, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday morning. He was 92.

Mr. Patel was rushed to a private hospital in Ahmedabad after he fell unconscious at his residence in Gandhinagar. The nonagenarian had recently tested positive for COVID-19 but had recovered.

The BJP veteran was Gujarat’s chief minister in 1995 when the party came to power for the first time and again during 1998-2001. Prime Minister Narendra Modi succeeded him as Gujarat chief minister in October 2001.

As news of his demise became public, condolences began pouring in from top functionaries and leaders including the President of India Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

President Ram Nath Kovind in his condolence message tweeted, “With the demise of Keshubhai Patel, former Gujarat chief minister, the nation has lost a stalwart leader. His long public life was dedicated to improving the lives of millions, especially in villages. As champion of farmers’ causes, he enjoyed extraordinary rapport with masses.”

Paying a rich tribute to the late Chief Minister and grassroots leader, Prime Minister described him as his mentor. “Our beloved and respected Keshubhai passed away… I am deeply pained and saddened. He was an outstanding leader who cared for every section of society. His life was devoted towards the progress of Gujarat and the empowerment of every Gujarati.”

“Keshubhai mentored and groomed many younger karyakartas including me. Everyone loved his affable nature. His demise is an irreparable loss. We are all grieving today. My thoughts are with his family and well wishers. Spoke to his son Bharat and expressed condolences. Om Shanti,” Mr. Modi tweeted from his social media handle.

During his long political career, Mr Patel, who had begun his political innings with the Jan Sangh, was six-time member of the State Assembly, member of Rajya Sabha and minister and Chief Minister of the State besides holding the post of leader of the opposition.

After he resigned as Chief Minister in 2001 following the party’s poor performance in local elections and also after a devastating earth quake in which more than 15,000 people died in January 2001, Mr Patel was sent to Rajya Sabha from Gujarat.

In the run up to the Assembly polls in 2012, Mr. Patel had floated a regional party Gujarat Parivartan party (GPP), which fared poorly winning only two seats in the State. Before the parliamentary polls in 2014, Mr. Patel had resigned as MLA while merging his GPP with BJP.

Subsequently, he retired from political life and devoted his time to Somnath Temple Board where he was chairman of the trust in which Mr. Modi and Mr. Amit Shah are also members.

As Chief Minister, Mr Patel is credited with pioneering works in building canal networks of the Narmada project to bring water from South Gujarat to water starved Saurashtra and North Gujarat regions.

In fact, both his tenures as CM were marked with political instability which had led to his resignation in 1995 and subsequently from 1998 onwards, with natural calamities like consecutive droughts, massive cyclones and the devastating Bhuj earthquake in 2001.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pqhuom/article32978557.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Keshubhai-patel-death-2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/keshubhai-patel-former-gujarat-cm-passes-away/article32970873.ece

Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Thursday promised to take immediate action after a passenger alleged violation of COVID-19 social distancing protocol at the Srinagar airport.

Sanjay Raina posted three pictures on Twitter on Thursday morning showing passengers standing extremely close to each other during a security check at the airport.

256,2020/10/29,"NIA raids NGOs, trusts in Kashmir, Delhi in connection with terror funding case","NIA raids bid to frame me, says ex-chief of Delhi minorities panel

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted raids at seven locations in the Kashmir Valley and at two locations in Delhi for the second day in connection with a case pertaining to “certain NGOs and Trusts raising funds in the name of charitable activities and then using those funds for carrying out secessionist and separatist activities in J&K.”

Also read: NIA searches 10 places in Kashmir, one in Bengaluru

NIA said the case was registered under various sections of the anti-terror law, UAPA, as per the directions of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on receipt of credible information that certain NGOs and Trusts are collecting funds domestically and abroad through donations and business contributions in the name of various welfare activities such as public health, education etc.

“Further, these funds are sent to J&K through various channels such as hawala and cash couriers and are used to carry out and sustain secessionist and terrorist activities in J&K,” the NIA said in a statement.

The NGOs raided on Thursday are JK Yateem Foundation at Srinagar and Kulgam, the Salvation Movement at Srinagar run by Zafar Akbar Bhat, Human Welfare Foundation at Delhi and Anantnag, Jammu and Kashmir Voice of Victims at Baramulla run by Abdul Qadeer. Falah-e-Aaam Trust at Budgam run by G.M. Bhat and Charity Alliance at Delhi run by Zafarul Islam Khan. Mr. Khan is former chairman of Delhi Minorities Commission and the founding editor of Milli Gazette, an english newspaper.

Helped riot victims

Mr. Khan said on Twitter that the raids seemed an attempt to implicate him in “some terror or riot case.” The Charity Alliance has been engaged in providing relief and aid to victims who were affected by riots in February in Delhi.

“My home and offices were raided by NIA this morning from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. They took many papers, all laptops, hard disks of all desktops, cash found etc. They showed me an order on their mobile, issued by one Yadav of NIA to conduct the raid linking me and my NGO with Kashmir terror, although I have no relationship or even contacts with Kashmiri militants and have not even visited Kashmir for many years. It seems an attempt to implicate me in some terror or riot case,” Mr. Khan said.

In another tweet, he said: “Thrown to stone age. No laptop, no mobile, no desktop. NIA people said order for raid came from the very top and they were woken up at 4 a.m. for this great task of raiding a journalist. They had no patience. They jumped the wall to enter my house like they did with Chidambram.”

NIA claimed that several incriminating documents and electronic devices have been seized during searches.

Later in the day, the Delhi Police registered a case against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislator Amanatullah Khan for allegedly disrupting NIA raid at the house of Mr Khan. The case was registered after the AAP legislator accompanied by a group of persons stormed into the house while the NIA team was conducting searches. A Delhi Police official said the case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the NIA.

‘Aimed at reprisal’

Meanwhile, an Association of Disappeared Persons (APDP), headed by Praveena Ahanger, described the NIA raids on its office and the house of Ms. Ahangar on Wednesday as “a clear case of reprisal and crackdown on the human rights defenders in Kashmir”.

“The raids seem to be a premeditated and planned assault. Our voices are being brutally crushed. Our demand for justice is being criminalised,” the spokesman said.

According to the APDP, the organisation has been supported for the last nine years by UN funds from the UN Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture (UNVFVT).

“In July 2020, the APDP had received an emergency grant from UNVFVT. In September 2020, the APDP had submitted almost 40 testimonies of victims who were subjected to arbitrary detention and torture by security forces in Kashmir to the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture. With this raid, our work has been disrupted and our staff, including our founder, is being harassed,” the spokesman added.

At least 70 cows died on Wednesday due to suspected food poisoning at a cow shelter in Haryana’s Panchkula.

Naresh Mittal, general secretary of the ‘Mata Mansa Devi Gaudham’ cow shelter in Panchkula, said 70 cows had died while 30 were taken ill. “Most of the cows that were ill have recovered. It apparently looks to be a case of food poisoning caused by food offered by some devotee, and not on account of fodder,” he said.

“There are around 1,350 cows in seven sheds at the shelter. The deaths were reported in two sheds. If there was a problem in the fodder then deaths would have been reported from other sheds as well,” he said.

Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta, BJP MLA from Panchkula, visited the cow shelter and announced a three-member committee to probe the incident.

“The incident of 70 cows dying is saddening. We have constituted a three-member inquiry committee under the chief executive officer of the Panchkula Zila Parishad, which will submit its report in three days. Anyone found guilty would be dealt with sternly, Mr. Gupta told The Hindu.

In the run-up to the by-polls in Gujarat, the ruling BJP and Opposition Congress are trading barbs over a man arrested for allegedly hurling a shoe at Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel on Monday in Karjan.

Each party has accused the other of associating with the local political worker.

The shoe “attack” took place on Monday evening at Kurali village under Karjan taluka of Vadodara when Mr. Patel was addressing the media after a rally. The footwear missed the target and landed a few inches away.

According to the Vadodara district police, the accused, Rashmin Patel, is a resident of Shinor taluka of the district and is a Congress worker. “Based on a specific tip-off, we arrested Rashmin Patel, a Congress worker, for his involvement in throwing a shoe at Nitin Patel,” Vadodara SP Sudhir Desai told media persons after the arrest.

Even before the man’s arrest, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani had said that a Congress worker must have been involved.

However, the Congress rejected the police claim. State Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi shared documents with local media to claim that Rashmin Patel was actually a BJP worker and belonged to a dissident group within the party.

“According to this official document of the Gujarat State Election Commission, Rashmin Patel won the Shinor taluka panchayat election on a BJP ticket in 2010. He was also chairman of the executive committee of the taluka panchayat from 2010 to 2013,” Mr Doshi said.

Referring to the episode 3 of the series, Mr. Pathak said character Satyanand Tripathi, played by veteran actor Kulbhushan Kharbanda, is shown reading from his novel Dhabba. “What the character has been shown reading through a voice-over is sheer pornography, which I cannot even dream of writing, supposedly to titillate the reader. It has no bearing with the original text of Dhabba. In fact, there is no character named Baldev Raj in the said novel,” said Mr. Pathak. He is seeking immediate removal of the said sequence failing which he would “initiate legal proceedings against the producers, writers and the actor”.

The 80-year-old prolific writer said the “sequence defames him as an author and puts him in a bad light”. “I have been published by the multi-national publishers such as Harper Collins and Westland which is, ironically, an Amazon company.”

Dhabba was originally published by Raj Pocket Books in 2010.

Film critic Bobby Sing, who wrote about the misrepresentation in a Facebook post, said it showed the “absurd assumptions” of certain writer-directors about Hindi crime novels and their authors. “They would not have done it with foreign writers,” he said.

‘Not symbolic’

“We could understand that a production assistant came up with the wrong book at the last minute but how can you show reading an excerpt from a book which is not there in it,” said film critic Ajay Brahmatmaj. “Surendra Mohan Pathak is not Mastram. He is not symbolic of the kind of writing that the writer and director are referring to. It reflects that many of those who are writing and directing films and web series in Hindi are not aware of the social, cultural, literary aspects of Hindi,” added Mr. Brahmatmaj.

Interestingly, on September 14, the Hindi Day, the PR agency promoting Mirzapur issued a press release wherein it said the team of Mirzapur would help you speak pure Hindi. But the words that it cited in the release were bhaukaal (awesome impression), kantaap (a slap delivered near the ear region) and bawaal (chaos). “These are slangs or colloquial words which practitioners of dignified language avoid even in eastern part of Uttar Pradesh where the series is set,” said Mr. Brahmatmaj.

The Amazon Prime PR team didn’t respond despite repeated attempts. Mr. Pathak said he had been approached by a senior team member and had been promised a discussion over the issue.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/qu0fhj/article32967117.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29SCENE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/my-novel-misrepresented-in-mirzapur-2/article32967118.ece
261,2020/10/29,"BJP hits the streets over political killing, custodial death of party supporters in Bengal","Demonstrations, violent protests in Kolkata and Howrah

Protests, demonstrations and road blockades over allegations of political violence and custodial death returned to West Bengal on Wednesday, barely a couple of days after Durga Puja festival drawing to a close.

State unit Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders held a protest at Gandhi Statue on Mayo Road in Kolkata over the alleged custodial death of Madan Ghorui, a BJP worker from Patashpur in Purba Medinipur district. Family members of Ghorui, along with State BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu and Mahila Morcha president Agnimitra Paul held a demonstration for hours at the venue demanding probe by a central investigating agency into the death.

‘Will he get justice?’

“Madan Ghorui, BJP booth vice-president who died in police custody, will he never get justice? All we asked for was a second post-mortem, which was granted but the State govt has been creating obstacles, WHY? What are you scared of Didi? This is police brutality and murder!,” West Bengal BJP tweeted from its official Twitter handle. On October 16 the Calcutta High Court ordered a fresh post mortem of the body at a State-run hospital and directed that the proceedings be video recorded.

Late on Wednesday there was violence in Bagnan area of Howrah district over the death of another BJP worker Kinkar Majhi who, according to party leaders, was shot on Saturday night and succumbed to injuries. The party has also called for a 12- hour bandh in Bagnan on Thursday.

State unit BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu said that the administration is not giving the body of the BJP worker to the family saying he has tested positive for COVID-19.

Several BJP supporters gathered at the State-run NRS Medical College and Hospital where Majhi’s post mortem was done.

Mr. Basu said that more than 120 BJP supporters have been killed in political violence in the State in the past few years during the regime of Trinamool Congress.

Meanwhile, the Trinamool Congress has launched a digital ‘Mark Yourself Safe from BJP’ campaign across all it’s social media handles to “unite people against the wrongdoings committed by the BJP across the country”.

262,2020/10/29,Rhino horn trade: 7 Kaziranga workers held,"They gave in to greed, says park official

A piece of rhino horn believed to have been salvaged from the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) has led to the arrest of 17 people, including seven casual workers of the prime wildlife habitat in Assam.

Forest and police officers said the piece might not be associated with poaching. But the arrest of the Kaziranga workers has uncovered what officials said was a “non-violent” wildlife crime — collecting pieces that fall off rhino horns naturally or during infighting and trading them illegally.

“So far, seven of our frontline staff members have been arrested for involvement in rhino horn trading,” said P. Sivakumar, Director of KNPTR.

“All seven are mahouts who can access tougher parts of the park on elephant-back and are more likely to spot and collect animal body parts. They probably gave in to greed,” said Ramesh Chandra Gogoi, KNPTR’s Divisional Forest Officer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rhino-horn-trade-7-kaziranga-workers-held/article32967081.ece
263,2020/10/29,Centre’s farm laws will hit market reforms: experts,"‘They won’t augur well for small farmers’

Ahead of the Rajasthan Assembly session in which the Bills against the Centre’s agriculture sector laws will be introduced, experts at the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) here have opposed the Central legislations. The three statutes would impinge on constitutional rights of States and violate the federal structure, said the experts.

The IDS held a discussion on the farm laws and their impact on the State’s agriculture and economy earlier this week to find an academic basis for the legislative exercise. Academicians, agricultural experts and development practitioners said the States would find it difficult to initiate market reforms for major crops because of the Central laws having an overriding effect.

IDS Director S. Mohanakumar said the three Central Acts, put together, would throw the agriculture sector to the mercy of large agro-industrial capital, which would not augur well for the majority of farmers with small land holdings. They would also undermine the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) in the States, he added.

‘Laws will finish ties’

“The relationship between commission agents in APMCs and farmers has been established through generations. The new laws will finish these relations,” Dr. Mohanakumar said.

Other experts who took part in the event included National Institute of Agricultural Marketing Director-General P. Chandra Shekara and Kerala State Planning Board member K.N. Harilal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/centres-farm-laws-will-hit-market-reforms-experts/article32967074.ece

265,2020/10/29,Congress invokes Rani Laxmibai to target Scindia in Madhya Pradesh,"Why were they silent for 30 years while my father was a member, asks BJP MP

The Congress in Madhya Pradesh is attempting to appropriate Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi, among leaders of the 1857 rebellion against the British, by invoking her name to target its former leader Jyotiraditya Scindia ahead of the byelections to 28 seats.

When Mr. Scindia, a BJP MP, was scheduled to address a public meeting recently in the Sanwer Vidhan Sabha constituency of Indore, a group of girls dressed up as the queen took to the streets. “I am Rani Laxmibai. The Scindia family is my murderer. Why are members of the Scindia family here in Sanwer. Shoo away these murders,” they shouted.

The reference is to the claim of a few historians that the Scindia dynasty of Gwalior had betrayed the queen and joined hands with the British, which helped quell the uprising. With three political leaders of the family now in the BJP, including Mr. Scindia’s aunts Vasundhara Raje and Yashodhara Raje, the Congress is flaying him by claiming he had ‘betrayed’ the mandate and the State’s voters in the present.

Further, the Congress is associating the trope with the alleged historical injustice meted out to the queen, a symbol of pride and women empowerment in the Gwalior Chambal region, a stronghold of Mr. Scindia where 16 seats are up for contest. In addition, the party has promised voters of organising programmes in memory of Rani Laxmibai and erect her statues in the constituencies if it returns to power.

While visiting the queen’s memorial here, 68-year-old Rajneesh Tomar said he had heard of “some kind of betrayal” at the hands of the Scindias in relation to the queen, but was unsure of its nature. “What is the point of broaching the past when there are more pressing issues in the present like unemployment, corruption and the agrarian crisis. The parties should focus on that,” he said.

Ramsevak Das of the Siddh Peeth Shri Gangadasji Maharaj ki Badi Shala, an ashram behind the memorial that claims the queen breathed her last within its compound, said, “For whatever reason the Scindias weren’t able to support the rebellion, history shouldn’t be politicised,” he said.

To spread the message further, the Congress has begun distributing to ‘intellectuals’ a book titled Jhansi ki Rani Laxmibai, which also makes the allegation against the family. The Hindi text penned by Vrindavanlal Verma, claims the party, was pulled out of circulation in the region by the family.

“I wish the Congress all the best. I wonder why they were silent for 30 years while my father was a member. And I wonder why they were silent for 20 years while I was a member,” Mr. Scindia told The Hindu.

“I think the public sees through such nefarious designs and duplicity. They [the Congress] should take a lesson in history before they comment on my family. My family’s contribution to the nation is well known. I don’t think the public needs a lesson in history, the least of all from Kamal Nath, who should speak about his own history rather than about others,” he said.

Keshav Pandey, public relations officer of Mr. Scindia, claimed the attempts at the appropriation would yield no dividends for the Congress. “Voters want to hear of only the development of their region. The party quotes a poem which is a product of imagination. There is no element of truth to it,” he said.

“The betrayal of Rani Laxmibai is the biggest weapon with the Congress,” said K.K. Mishra, party media incharge for Gwalior-Chambal. “Everyone is talking about their betrayal in the present and the past. Do they believe voters are stupid?” he asked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cong-invokes-laxmibai-to-target-scindia-in-mp/article32967066.ece

According to a press release, the officials initiated investigation by searches and summon proceedings against MSK Associated Traders and found that the unit was into bill (invoice) trading by issuing invoices without supply of goods to various units through intra and inter-State trade. These were mostly to scrap dealers or traders. The tax amount in the fake invoice was availed of as input tax credit by the traders who received the fake invoices on commission basis without receipt of actual goods. The invoices were used for further bill trading or tax payment of supply of non-duty paid goods procured without bills from the open market.

M. Sampath Kumar, proprietor of MSK Associated Traders admitted to the office and was remanded in judicial custody on October 29. The total tax evasion worked out to ₹9.7 crore.

282,2020/10/29,Male leopard found dead,"A five-year-old male leopard was found dead with an improvised projectile lodged in one of its hind limbs near Pandalur on Tuesday.

The leopard was found dead inside a tea field belonging to a major tea estate in Pandalur, and a post mortem was conducted. Apart from a few bite marks sustained possibly as a result of a fight with another animal, the post-mortem revealed that the animal had been shot with a projectile which had lodged itself in one of its hind limbs, which forest officials believe had led to its death.

The animal was found dead just a few kilometres away from the area where a male elephant was found dead with a similar projectile lodged in one of its legs last month.

On Wednesday, District Forest Officer, Gudalur Division, Sumesh Soman, admitted that there were “similarities” between the two incidents, but added that it was too early to come to a conclusion as to whether the killings of both the animals were connected.

“Three forest teams, a tracking team and a sniffer dog have been pressed into service to find the persons responsible,” said Mr. Soman, who added that the leopard had been shot just a few days prior to being found dead inside the estate.

Indian team coach Ravi Shastri has urged Suryakumar Yadav to “stay strong and patient” after the Mumbai Indians batsman impressed against Royal Challengers Bangaore despite the heartbreak of being ignored for India’s tour of Australia.

“Surya namaskar. Stay strong and patient @surya_14kumar #MIvsRCB,” tweeted Shastri.

His innings earned praise from several former stars with ex Indian opener Virender Sehwag saying it won’t be long before Suryakumar dons the Indian jersey. “Bandey mein hai Dum.

285,2020/10/29,"IPL 2020 | CSK vs KKR: Classy Gaikwad, nerveless Jadeja dent KKR’s playoff chances in thriller","Opener sets the chase up with 72 before all-rounder smashes sixes off the last two balls to take CSK past the finish line; Rana’s 87 not enough for Morgan’s side

With nine balls left and 27 to defend, Kolkata Knight Riders would have fancied its chances. But Ravindra Jadeja produced some mighty hits in an unbeaten 31 off just 11 balls (2x4, 3x6) to help Chennai Super Kings win by six wickets at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday.

The momentum shift

Lockie Ferguson lost control of proceedings during the final three legal deliveries of the 19th over against Jadeja, conceding 17 runs, including a no-ball and a free-hit six, leaving CSK needing only 10 runs off the final over.

Despite Kamlesh Nagarkoti’s best efforts in changing the equation to seven off the last two balls, Jadeja’s experience ensured he sent them over the deep mid-wicket and wide long-on fence to seal the match.

The defeat leaves KKR’s playoff chances in jeopardy. It also confirms Mumbai Indians’ place in the last four.

Exquisite shots

Chasing 173 for victory, Gaikwad set it up for CSK with a classy 72 off 53 balls (6x4, 2x6). The youngster played some exquisite shots against the likes of Ferguson and Pat Cummins. Gaikwad was particularly severe on Ferguson, pulling and lifting him over the in-field with courage and conviction. Ambati Rayudu gave the innings tempo with a 20-ball 38 (5x4, 1x6), as he added 68 for the second wicket with Gaikwad in just 6.1 overs. Varun Chakravarthy bowled a fine spell (4-0-20-2) for KKR.

Earlier, KKR made 172 for five after being put in, thanks to Nitish Rana’s scintillating 87 off 61 balls (10x4, 4x6).

Shubman Gill and Rana provided KKR with a solid start, putting on 53 runs for the opening wicket.

Rana, after a cautious start, cut loose against Mitchell Santner in the sixth over, sweeping the left-arm spinner for two boundaries and following it up with a six over mid-wicket.

Fighting back

CSK fought back in the next few overs through its spinners Santner, Karn Sharma and Jadeja. However, Rana then went after Karn in the 16th over, hitting the leggie for three consecutive sixes on the leg-side to give KKR the final push.

The southpaw seemed on course for a big hundred before he was deceived by a slower one from Lungi Ngidi.

Dinesh Karthik helped KKR finish strongly as he came up with a 10-ball 21 that contained three boundaries. However, Gaikwad and Jadeja ensured that CSK had the last laugh.

MI enters playoffs

KKR’s loss against CSK meant that MI became the first team to qualify for the playoffs

The emergence of Australia’s Josh Philippe as a promising opening partner for Devdutt Padikkal was the biggest positive from Royal Challengers Bangalore’s five-wicket loss to Mumbai Indians on Wednesday, Head Coach Simon Katich said.

The 23-year-old Philippe, who had come in for an out-of-form Aaron Finch, scored a 24-ball 33 and combined with Padikkal for 71 runs.

“The two youngsters at the top were a big positive. They got us off to a great start.

“At one stage it looked like we were going to get well on top with the bat, but unfortunately young Josh was stumped and it sort of slowed [us] down.”

Mohammed Siraj, who had wreaked havoc with the new ball the last time RCB played in Abu Dhabi, did not open the bowling. But Katich said the presence of two left-handers in Quinton de Kock and Ishan Kishan played a part.

“Sometimes it is because of the conditions and sometimes the match-ups. With two left-handers the skipper felt we had to get [Washington] Sundar into the game and he did a very good job.

288,2020/10/29,India likely to back New Zealand’s Greg Barclay for ICC chairman’s post,"There are a few issues due to which current ICC deputy chairman Imran Khwaja won’t find favour with the BCCI.

The BCCI is likely to back the candidature of New Zealand’s Greg Barclay over Singapore’s Imran Khwaja in the elections for the ICC chairman, a post vacated by India’s Shashank Manohar after two terms in July this year.

Barclay and Khwaja are the only two candidates contesting for the chairman’s post and the 16-member all-powerful ICC Board is set to vote in the first week of December.

While hectic back-channel talks are on to find a unanimous candidate and put up a picture of unity among the Board of Directors (mostly comprising of member nations), it is highly unlikely that Khwaja will have the backing of the Indian cricket board.

“The BCCI is more aligned with New Zealand Cricket (NZC) and those who matter in Indian cricket board find Barclay as a more suitable candidate for the post. Also Khwaja’s policy positioning isn’t exactly in favour of Indian cricket,” a senior official, privy to developments in ICC board, told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

“But one month is a big time in cricket’s administrative politics. If Khwaja can come around and probably be on the same page with the BCCI, you never know. Barclay, with his focus on bilateral cricket, is more acceptable to India,” the veteran administrator, who has seen many a board room battles, said.

There are a few issues due to which current ICC deputy chairman Khwaja won’t find favour with the BCCI.

Firstly, the role played by him along with Manohar to roll back the proposed revenue model in which India, England and Australia stood to gain more.

The matter was up for vote and Khwaja and Manohar, had back then, gathered enough votes to crush the BCCI.

Secondly, the ICC in 2019, had drawn up a rough calendar for the 2023 FTP cycle and till 2028, each and every year, there was a senior men’s flagship event kept in that, the revenues from which would have benefitted the smaller nations.

It is understood that the white paper that ICC prepared had Khwaja’s tacit support. In fact, BCCI had strong objections to such a proposal.

However, in the post COVID-19 world, each and every board, which has had multiple bilateral series cancelled, would like to squeeze in as many of them as there is handsome revenue generation through broadcasting rights.

That Khwaja will not have BCCI’s backing is also a given considering his proximity to Pakistan Cricket Board head Ehsan Mani.

The BCCI and PCB have had their share of differences in the ICC board.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/k0mqcz/article32896763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20-IB-ICCG83GLF7SJ9GD3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-likely-to-back-new-zealands-greg-barclay-for-icc-chairmans-post/article32972644.ece
289,2020/10/29,"Would not be surprised if Dhoni is retained as CSK captain in 2021, says Gambhir","Three-time winners Chennai Super Kings have failed to clear the leagues stage for the first time in the tournament’s history.

Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Chennai Super Kings owners share such mutual trust and fabulous relationship that he could be retained as captain of the side in 2021 despite enduring an abysmal IPL season in the UAE, says former India opener Gautam Gambhir.

Three-time winners CSK have failed to clear the leagues stage for the first time in the tournament’s history and are currently placed at the bottom of the points table following an unprecedented eight defeats in 12 outings.

“I keep saying that why CSK is CSK is because of the relationship between the owners and the captain. They have given all the freedom to MS, and MS has received all the mutual respect from the owners as well,” Gambhir was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo.

“So I would not be surprised if they continue with MS and MS plays till the time he wants to play. And then next year he still continues to be the captain and have a much different squad than what he has this time around.”

“He deserves that much of appreciation from the owners.”

The 39-year-old Dhoni’s future has come under scrutiny in the wake of CSK’s mediocre performances in the ongoing IPL.

Gambhir, who flourished under Dhoni’s captaincy in international cricket, pointed out his overall record as CSK skipper.

“What he has done for the franchise and how the franchise actually deals with MS and treats MS is a fabulous relationship.

“And that is how every franchise should deal with their captain, who has delivered for them.”

The ongoing season has been a far cry from their glory days, having managed only eight points so far after four wins.

Gambhir said, “MS has won them three (IPL) trophies, couple of Champions Leagues, he has made them one of the top successful sides in the IPL after Mumbai Indians.

“So CSK saying they are going to continue with MS - it is just the relationship, it is just the mutual respect.

“That’s why MS has been so loyal (to the Super Kings). That’s why MS has given everything: heart and soul, his sweat, sleepless nights - I’m sure he must have had sleepless nights while he has continued captaining CSK.”

Chennai Super Kings’ unflinching reliance on experience over youth has been their undoing this IPL season, said West Indies batting icon Brian Lara, urging the franchise to give its younger lot a chance in the remaining games.

One of the most successful sides in the history of the tournament, CSK are languishing at the bottom of the points table. While most sides nurture youngsters, that has not been the case with the Mahendra Singh Dhoni led side, often referred to as ‘Dad’s Army’

“I think they (CSK) have got a lot of older players. There are not any young players coming through the line-up. You look at it. Even their overseas players, they have been around for a long time,” Lara said on Star Sports’ ‘Select Dugout’

“So, they have backed experience over youth, and this has really turned upside down for them,” he added.

It is the first time Dhoni and his men have failed to clear the league stage, having managed only eight points so far after four wins.

The three-time champions’ poor run this season has put a question-mark on their approach, leading to heavy criticism of Dhoni, who has been accused of not showing enough faith in the youngsters.

“It’s just an unbelievable season so far. You know, every time they turn up, we’re very hopeful that CSK is going to turn it around,” Lara said.

“We all came here thinking this was going to be the time when Dhoni turns things around with his team. And game after game, it just went, and they just kept hoping.”

“But it’s a situation where they can just to try to build from next year.

They are in fourth position with 12 points from as many games, while the Royals have slumped to the penultimate spot with 10 points having suffered seven defeats from 12 outings.

It’s a mad scramble for the play-offs. With Mumbai Indians all but through, six teams are in the hunt for the remaining three spots.

The Royals can’t afford to slip up. If they lose on Friday they will be out of the reckoning while a defeat for Punjab will dent their chances for a top-four finish.

They would expect their skipper Rahul, the leading run-scorer of the tournament, to fire in the crucial game after three underwhelming performances with the bat.

The addition of Chris Gayle has done wonders for the team’s confidence.

It is to be seen if Mayank Agarwal, who missed two games with a bruised knee, returns to the side. In his absence, Mandeep Singh revelled in the role of an opener with a match-winning unbeaten 66 in the win against Kolkata Knight Riders.

Punjab’s bowling, which has been their weakest link throughout the tournament, has been exceptional in their recent wins, choking the opposition for runs.

The Royals will also be high on confidence after their morale boosting win over table toppers Mumbai and would be desperate to keep the winning momentum going.

The biggest positive for the Royals is Ben Stokes roaring back to form after rusty displays in previous five outings. The English all-rounder, who has been elevated to the role of opener, smashed an unbeaten 107 to help seal a seven-wicket win over Mumbai earlier this week.

Sanju Samson is also back among runs, while Jos Buttler has looked erratic. That skipper Steve Smith is in the middle of a lean patch will augur well for KXIP.

The Jofra Archer-led bowling attack has looked ordinary. The Barbados-born English pacer, who is having a stellar individual season with 17 wickets from 12 matches with an economy of 6.71, has done most of the heavy lifting with the ball without adequate support from the rest of the bowlers.

Morris got his revenge when he dismissed Pandya in the fifth ball of the over and gave him a send off. Mumbai Indians’ won the match by five wickets.

Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper Virat Kohli on Wednesday praised Mumbai Indians’ death bowling, saying it ensured his team fell 20 runs short of a par-score in their IPL game.

After restricting RCB to 164 for six, thanks to their effective death bowling led by pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah (3/14), Mumbai Indians rode on Suryakumar Yadav’s blistering 79 to chase down the target with five wickets and as many balls to spare.

“It was a strange phase of batting out there (in the last five overs), everything we hit went to the fielders and right into the hands as well, these things happen on the field.

“They bowled in good areas and they bowled in right channels in the last five overs and we were 20 runs short of what could have been a par-score,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation.

According to Kohli, his team was in the game till the 17th over of Mumbai’s chase, but the opposition batted well and finished the game in a professional manner.

“Still I think we gave a good fight with the ball and were in the game right till about 17th over and it was a decent effort by the boys.

“The game was tight till about the 17th, probably we needed a couple of wickets there, they batted really well to play that phase out and finish professionally,” added Kohli.

RCB, despite the loss, are sitting at the second spot in the points table and Kohli felt if the team wins the final two games, then it would finish in the top two.

“Some teams peak early and some teams have off games at the wrong time. I think, the bottom half of the table, those teams are playing some really good cricket.

“We are going to focus on what we can do, we have two more games, we win both, then we definitely finish top two,” said Kohli.

Winning skipper Kieron Pollard lauded Suryakumar, saying time and again he has stamped his class.

“Time and time again, no matter the situation, he (Surya) continues to show the class of a player he is. He must be very, very disappointed not to don the blue as yet for India but I think he is very, very close.

“As a spectator I am looking from the outside, he has done some amazing things for us in this franchise and the most he can do is continue to make the bat talk and score runs for us and, hopefully, that takes us all the way,” said Pollard.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/9lzkdu/article32967758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRATKOHLI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-mumbai-bowled-in-right-areas-in-last-5-we-were-20-runs-short-kohli/article32967759.ece
294,2020/10/29,BJP’s Spiritual Front issues ultimatum to govt. on opening of religious places,"It threatens to break open locks of temples on November 1

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-affiliated Spiritual Front on Wednesday said that it would break open locks of temples and other religious places on November 1 if the State government did not decide to reopen them by then.

A delegation led by Tushar Bhosle, president of the State BJP’s Spiritual Front, held a meeting with Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari demanding that religious places be reopened.

“We have already held two agitations in this regard, but the State government did not accept our demand. We had also sent two letters to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeay seeking meetings, but we did not get any reply,” Mr. Bhosle said.

He said that they expected that even though Mr. Thackeray did not agree for a meeting, he would issue directions to reopen temples and other religious places. “But he has not announced any date as of now. We are forced to take the extreme step on November 1,” he said.

The BJP has already conducted two State-wide agitations and even held a meeting with Mr. Koshyari. Following the last meeting with the Governor, he had sent a letter to Mr. Thackeray. The content of the letter turned out to be controversial after Mr. Koshyari went on to ask whether the CM had turned secular.

The CM too reacted sharply reminding the Governor about the Constitution. The Governor was also snubbed by Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar and later by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, as well.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/bjps-spiritual-front-issues-ultimatum-to-govt-on-opening-of-religious-places/article32967774.ece
295,2020/10/29,Supreme Court says will study ordinance to check stubble-burning,"Urges lawyers’ appearing in the case to shed their “beautiful cars” and take to bicycles.

Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde on Thursday said the apex court will study the new ordinance promulgated by the government to check stubble-burning by farmers and will pass orders if necessary.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed the court about The Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance of 2020.

The ordinance is meant to both prevent and monitor stubble-burning by farmers of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. The air pollution caused by the indiscriminate burning of the fields is choking Delhi.

“We will hear you [Mr. Mehta] and petitioners on steps to be taken under the ordinance and if necessary will issue directions,” Chief Justice Bobde observed, posting the case to Friday next week.

As an aside, Chief Justice Bobde urged the lawyers’ appearing in the case to shed their “beautiful cars” and take to bicycles as a clean mode of transport.

On Monday, the court had decided to “keep in abeyance” its pre-Dasara order appointing former apex court judge, Justice Madan B. Lokur, to a one-man committee to monitor/prevent stubble-burning.

The decision came soon after Mr. Mehta had informed the Bench about the coming of a law to “tackle the problem”.

On October 16, the court had asked Justice Lokur to protect Delhi NCR from air pollution with the help of student volunteer forces deployed from the NCC, the NSS and the Bharat Scouts and Guides.

The court had said the student forces could patrol highways and fields in the three States and ensure that no fires were started in the fields.

The court had chosen Justice Lokur as he had headed the Green Bench which was monitoring stubble-burning for two whole years before his retirement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1sgyqr/article32947669.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STUBBLEBURNING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/supreme-court-says-will-study-ordinance-to-check-stubble-burning/article32974202.ece

299,2020/10/29,Delhi’s air quality borders ‘severe’ category amid spike in farm fires in Punjab,"Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 397 at 11 am on Thursday

The national capital’s overall air quality inched closer to the severe category on Thursday morning as pollution levels rose sharply after a marginal reduction, primarily due to calm winds and spike in farm fires.

The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said a significant increase in the number of fire points was observed over Punjab (around 3,000), Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday which is likely to impact the air quality of Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India.

Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 397 at 11 am on Thursday. The 24-hour average AQI was 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday.

Also read | India’s air quality data for comparing annual pollution is patchy

An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’

A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the wind speed dipped on Wednesday which allowed accumulation of pollutants.

Following slight relief, the air quality again entered the ‘very poor’ category by the evening, he said.

PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 420 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 10 am, the highest this season so far, according to CPCB data.

PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.

NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fires that covered most parts of Punjab and some regions of Haryana.

Stubble burning

According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was 18 per cent on Wednesday.

It was 23 per cent on Tuesday, the maximum this season so far, 16 per cent on Monday, 19 per cent on Sunday and 9 per cent on Saturday.

Also read | Centre promises law to check stubble burning

SAFAR said accumulation of locally generated pollutants and increased external intrusion due to north-north westerly boundary level winds from regions where stubble is burnt will be major factors for the increase in PM2.5 levels.

According to IMD, the predominant wind direction was northerly and the maximum wind speed was 8 kilometers per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 12.5 degrees Celsius - the lowest in this season so far.

On Wednesday, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said only green firecrackers can be manufactured, sold and used in the national capital.

He also said the Delhi government will launch an anti-firecracker campaign from November 3 and requested people not to burn crackers considering the seriousness of the situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/tv2lgp/article32968203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rai-campaignARGET7TGCFR3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhis-air-quality-borders-severe-category-amid-spike-in-farm-fires-in-punjab/article32970641.ece
300,2020/10/29,‘Green’ crackers to make full-fledged Delhi debut,"Fireworks sale likely to remain low for third consecutive Deepavali due to pandemic, economic slowdown

Delhi is set for its first full-fledged date with ‘green’ crackers this Deepavali amid growing sentiment against not deepening the air pollution crisis the Capital countenances every winter. A ban on fireworks was imposed in 2018 and in 2019 only ‘green’ crackers were allowed, but the permission had come too late for manufacturers to ensure their availability on time.

The production levels, however, are likely to be on the lower side this year due to the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic, with the Capital continuing to register high daily numbers of fresh infections. According to the Delhi police, 40 traders in all had applied for a licence to sell firecrackers in 2019; this year they received only 28 requests, out of which 15 have been given the nod. Around eight shops in Old Delhi have an all-year licence to sell firecrackers.

Traders aren’t betting on heavy sales and have invested cautiously. “This year, due to the lockdown, the manufacturing of fireworks remained suspended. The lockdown was lifted only during the rainy season that is unfavourable for manufacture of firecrackers. Supply is scarce and due to economic slowdown, we are not expecting buyers because green fireworks are somewhat expensive compared to conventional fireworks,” said Ankit Jain, a trader based in Old Delhi.

Emission tests

Anto Alphonse, DCP (North), said a team of the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation and Delhi Police would ensure the sale of green fireworks this Deepavali. PESO gives a final manufacturing licence after emission tests.

“There is a list of green fireworks manufacturers. The team will ensure traders purchase fireworks from authorised manufacturers in order to prevent the sale of unauthorised products. We also request people to purchase only green fireworks from licenced shops,” said Mr. Alphonse.

“After a wait of two years, we were hopeful of doing good business this year but the COVID-19 pandemic has severely hit sales. Even the wedding season was cold this year due to restrictions. There has been no sale of fireworks for celebrations other than Deepavali. Every year we are facing losses due to some reason or the other. I will surrender my licence if the situation doesn’t improve this year because solely depending upon the fireworks business for livelihood is no longer sustainable,” said a trader who wished not to be named.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/wpjsf3/article32967665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE28GREENCRACKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/green-crackers-to-make-full-fledged-delhi-debut/article32967666.ece
301,2020/10/29,"Anticipatory bail for Meham MLA, 2 others in cheating case","It appears to be a case of high-handedness of police: Judge

The District and Sessions Court here has granted anticipatory bail to Meham MLA Balraj Kundu and two others, including his younger brother, in a case of cheating and breach of trust.

The court said that prima facie, the design on the part of the complainant was to turn the civil litigation into a criminal one to exert pressure on the petitioners, but the law did not permit it.

Sessions Judge M.M. Dhonchak observed that the police had not displayed the “expected objectivity” in dealing with the case and “the complainant cannot be allowed to succeed in his design as it appears to be a case of high-handedness of the police in troubling the petitioners”.

“The sequence of events unfolded in this case is not a happy countenance,” remarked Mr. Dhonchak in his 16-page order.

Financial dispute

The matter pertains to financial dispute between the petitioners’ company, KCC Buildcon Pvt. Ltd., and Parivartan Singh, the former director of Parivartan Buildtech Pvt. Ltd., over a ₹75 crore-road project in Madhya Pradesh. A complaint was made to Gurugram police on October 10 and a case was registered at Sector 50 police station on charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy among others.

Mr. Dhonchak argued that Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC, were antithesis and in respect of one transaction both cannot be committed simultaneously.

He also pointed out that the Assistant Public Prosecutor failed to point out as to what valuable security was forged by the petitioners and how the alleged offence punishable under IPC Section 467 was made out against the accused.

“In so far as the story propounded by the complainant with regard to three letterheads, settlement paper and cheques not being there in the previous complaint, it shows that it was done as an exercise in an afterthought with a view to exaggerate the gravity of the offence and the same prima-facie appears to be untrue,” said the order.

Mr. Dhonchak also referred to the Supreme Court’s observations in the case of ‘M/s Indian Oil Corporation Vs. M/s NEPC India Limited and others’, that a growing tendency in business circles to convert purely civil disputes into criminal cases is obviously on account of a prevalent impression that civil law remedies are time-consuming and do not adequately protect the interests of lenders/creditors. “Any effort to settle civil disputes and claims, which do not involve any criminal offence, by applying pressure through criminal prosecution should be deprecated and discouraged,” observed the court.

Mr. Dhonchak, quoting another Supreme Court order, observed that “to hold a person guilty of cheating, it is necessary to show that he had a fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making the promise”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/anticipatory-bail-for-meham-mla/article32967532.ece
302,2020/10/29,Three persons get bail in riots case,"‘They cannot be kept in jail till everyone in mob is identified’

A Delhi court on Wednesday granted bail to three persons arrested in connection with the north-east Delhi riots and asked the investigating agency why it has been able to identify and chargesheet only the three persons from a riotous mob of several hundred people.

Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav, while granting bail to Shah Alam, Rashid Saifi and Mohd. Shadab, in a combined order, asked why the beat constable, who claimed to have categorically seen and identified the three accused indulging in the riots on February 24, waited for 40 days to record his statement.

“There is a gap of about 40 days between the date of incident and recording of statement of the beat constable by the Investigating Officer [IO] and no plausible explanation in this regard has been given by the IO,” the Judge said.

“What stopped the beat constable from reporting the matter then and there in the police station or from bringing it to the knowledge of senior police officers? This casts a serious doubt on the credibility of this witness,” the court rmarked.

No CCTV footage or viral video capturing the presence of the trio at the crime scene on the date of incident is available on record.

The judge also noted that the three men were neither named in the FIR nor were there are any specific allegations against them.

The court further noted that statements of public eyewitnesses have been recorded by the IO recently — a long time after filing of the chargesheet.

The court said that the three persons “cannot be incarcerated in jail for infinity merely because other persons, who were part of the riotous mob, have to be identified and arrested in the matter”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/three-persons-get-bail-in-riots-case/article32967529.ece

The alleged dispute over funding between the Delhi government and the BJP-run municipal corporations of Delhi reached Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal’s doorstep on Wednesday.

Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, led a delegation of the three Mayors and Opposition MLAs to Raj Niwas. Meanwhile, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said that the Delhi government should consider paying dues to the civic bodies in instalments.

AAP’s civic bodies in-charge Durgesh Pathak demanded an apology from the BJP, alleging that the municipalities had sufficient funds all along, which was why they had cleared some part of the dues to doctors and workers on Tuesday.

“We told the L-G that the Mayors had gone to meet the Chief Minister on Monday to talk about outstanding dues of ₹13,000 crore and house tax of ₹10,000 crore,” Mr. Bidhuri said, adding: “We have requested Mr. Baijal to direct the Delhi government to release outstanding funds at the earliest. He has given a positive response and assured us that he will take cognisance of the matter and take appropriate action.”

Mr. Gupta requested the Delhi government to release the funds even if it was in instalments. “Sanitation workers, doctors, healthcare workers and other employees have worked with complete vigilance and honesty during this [COVID-19] crisis, but the Delhi government is now reluctant to pay their salary,” Mr. Gupta said.

According to Delhi government sources, ₹1,965.91 crore was due to the civic bodies between April 1 and October 26. Of this, ₹1,752.61 crore has already been paid and the remainder was in the process of being credited to the civic bodies, as per data provided by the Urban Development Department.

Mr. Pathak alleged that the episode was an attempt to defame the Delhi government and that the BJP-run civic bodies had paid the salaries due on Tuesday.

“All the doctors and workers were paid their salaries by the BJP-led civic bodies.

Mr. Rai appealed to Delhiites to start a ‘no-cracker’ campaign, considering the seriousness of the situation due to COVID-19 pandemic and said that the two main reasons behind the spike in pollution are Deepavali and parali (stubble burning).

“Diwali is coming and we all know that the key reasons behind Delhi’s spike in air pollution is Diwali and parali. Crackers cause massive air pollution. Keeping in mind the air pollution situation of Delhi, we have decided that this year only manufacturing and use of green crackers will be allowed. This decision is as per the Supreme Court order of October 23, 2018,” Mr. Rai said.

“To make green crackers, pyrotechnic is used due to which the emission of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide does not occur. This is why using green crackers can control or curb the spike in pollution level. Due to these reasons the Supreme Court decided to ban all traditional cracker manufacturing in Delhi and allowed only green cracker,” Mr. Rai said.

Across India, the Minister said, there are around 93 companies, which make green crackers using pyrotechnic. A list of these companies will be uploaded on the Delhi government’s website on Thursday so traders can contact them.

The Supreme Court, according to Mr. Rai, had given the licencing department of Delhi Police the responsibility to enforce the ban on traditional firecrackers and the Delhi government would reach out to the State police on Thursday.

“The Delhi government will also launch an anti-cracker campaign from November 3. This campaign will continue after Diwali as well because many people burn crackers even after the festival,” he said.

11 special squads

“The Delhi Pollution Control Committee [DPCC] will form 11 different teams as special squads, which will have engineers, five environmental marshals with vehicles. The teams will keep a vigil on the manufacturers across the Capital,” he also said.

Mr. Rai also requested people to comply with norms and traders not to use any remaining stock of traditional firecrackers.

If the DPCC teams find any such firecrackers, strict action will be taken against violators under the Environmental Protection Act and Air Act, he cautioned. “I am hopeful that people will cooperate with us to combat air pollution,” he said.

Talking about the various initiatives taken by the Delhi government to combat air pollution, Mr. Rai said that the government is sprinkling bio-decomposer to stop stubble burning in the national capital and has also launched the ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign, anti-dust pollution campaign and has come up with the Electric Vehicle policy.

He added that the ‘Red light on, Gaadi off’ campaign now covers all the 70 Assembly constituencies in the Capital and that by November 2, it will cover all the 272 wards in the city.

The Minister said every person in Delhi should encourage five more persons to participate in the city government’s anti-vehicular pollution campaign.

He also said that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday would be launching an app, ‘Green Delhi’, by which people can share complaints about any violation of environmental norms.

Air quality

Meanwhile, the pollution level in the city improved on Wednesday with at an average AQI of 297 which fell in the ‘poor’ category, according to data provided by the Central Pollution Control Board. Air quality of Noida, Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Ghaziabad continued to be in the ‘very poor’ category, with AQI of 301, 324, 313 and 317 respectively.

Forecast shows that the air quality of Delhi will enter ‘very poor’ category on Thursday and then the ‘poor’ category again on Saturday",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/f7n7fr/article32967436.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29DEAQI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/govt-green-lights-green-firecrackers-this-year/article32967437.ece
307,2020/10/29,"Situation not normal, do not lower guard: Delhi’s 1st COVID-19 patient","Rohit Datta advises people to stay indoors during festive season as chances of virus spreading are higher

With experts predicting a major surge in COVID-19 cases in the coming months in Delhi, the city’s first COVID-19 patient on Wednesday cautioned people to stay indoors as much as possible during the festive season while emphasising that the situation is “not back to normal“.

Rohit Datta, who was diagnosed with the infection on March 1, made an appeal to the masses to “not lower our guard” by getting into a casual festive mode.

“I was diagnosed with COVID-19 at a time when the virus had already wreaked havoc in China and a few other countries. I was the first patient in Delhi. So much fear and uncertainty was there at that time. Despite all the research, the virus is still unpredictable,” the 46-year-old said. Mr. Datta cautioned that though the economy has been reopened people must realise that the situation in Delhi is “not back to normal”. He referred to many residents going out without wearing masks and violating social distancing norms, giving the example of youths who are putting up pictures on social media of parties and events “as if it’s all ok now“.

“It is still not ok and work is on for the elusive vaccine. In the festive season, the chances of infection being spread through symptomatic or asymptomatic carriers is huge,” he said.

Days before the festival of Deepavali, he urged people to step out only for urgent matters and to take full precautions. “If you love your family, stay home this Deepavali,” he said in his appeal to people.

Asked about his plan for Deepavali, Mr. Datta, a resident of Mayur Vihar in east Delhi who lives with his wife, two children and mother, said, “It will be a celebration of family bonds and nature“.

Family celebration

“For two years, our family has not burst crackers on Deepavali. This time, we will not step out at all. We will light ‘diyas’ to feel the power of nature and share sweets and warm moments with family members,” he said. “As they say, ‘Jaan hai to jehan hai’ (if you have life, you have the world), and I guess the adage applies aptly right now,” said the businessman.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/g9htmg/article32967403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29DEHONEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/situation-not-normal-do-not-lower-guard-delhis-1st-covid-19-patient/article32967404.ece
308,2020/10/29,‘Key accused had plans to abduct and forcibly marry victim’,"The prime accused in the murder case of a woman college student had plans to abduct and forcefully marry her, but he opened fire in a fit of rage when she resisted, said the police sources.

Nikita, 20, was shot dead by Tausheef and his friend Rehan in broad daylight during an abduction bid outside her college in Ballabgarh here on Monday. Both the accused were arrested.

Police sources said the two knew each other since school days. Tausheef had been putting pressure on her for marriage for long, but Nikita was not interested. He had abducted her in 2018 and a case was registered in this connection, but the woman’s family later withdrew the complaint.

On the fateful day, Tausheef along with Rehan reached outside Nikita’s college and the former tried to push her inside a car. But she resisted and Tausheef shot her point-blank. The two then drove away leaving behind the countrymade pistol, which was recovered from the spot. The car was also found on Sohna-Taura Road on Wednesday.

The SIT headed by ACP Anil Kumar met the deceased’s family at their Sector 23 residence on Wednesday to gather more details in the case. The phones of the two accused have been seized and their call details are being scrutinised. The police might also seek call details of the woman’s phone to ascertain whether the accused had tried to contact her before the incident.

Meanwhile, Tausheef’s uncle Javed, who had twice unsuccessfully contested Assembly elections from Sohna, said the law should take its own course and his nephew, if found guilty, should be punished as per the law. He claimed that the family made Tausheef surrender when the police contacted them on Monday and told them about his alleged involvement in the murder.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/key-accused-had-plans-to-abduct-and-forcibly-marry-victim/article32967368.ece
309,2020/10/29,Schools to remain shut: Sisodia,"Parents cagey about sending children for physical classes

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday announced that all schools in Delhi will remain closed until further orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mr. Sisodia said that there were some parents who expressed anxiousness and fear about schools reopening. “We assured them that schools will not reopen for now,” he said.

“Teachers, parents, and students have been wondering if schools will reopen during this difficult time. Many parents have also expressed their fear, especially if students congregate on school premises in close quarters,” said Mr. Sisodia, before announcing the continued closure of schools.

The Minister added that the possibility of spike in cases, or catching COVID-19 on school premises is high.

Even in countries where schools have reopened, cases have increased among students. “Keeping parent’s fear in mind, and the potential risk this can pose to children, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the Delhi government has decided to put children’s safety first, and hence, all schools will remain shut until further orders,” he added.

Parents welcome move

Parents have welcomed the government’s decision.

While online learning has been challenging and does not match the social environment of a school, nothing is more important than the safety of “our children”, said parents.

Preeti Khachroo Chandra, whose 12-year-old daughter studies in a private school, said: “The government’s decision makes a lot of sense. From the safety perspective of children, there is limited infrastructure at schools to have social distancing and other hygiene protocols. With the number of cases spiking in Delhi, it does not make sense to send children to schools. Their immune systems are sensitive and susceptible.”

Low attendance

Meanwhile, private schools in Uttar Pradesh’s Gautam Buddha Nagar are struggling to get students of Classes 9-12 back in classrooms as parents are apprehensive of sending their wards to school.

Private schools recorded 14% attendance on Tuesday, while government and aided schools clocked 39% in Noida and Greater Noida, said government officials.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/g6wrh1/article32967088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL29-ONLINECLASSES2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/schools-to-remain-shut-sisodia/article32967089.ece

Two men were arrested and two juveniles apprehended for allegedly damaging vehicles in outer Delhi’s Mangolpuri area, the police said on Wednesday.

In a video which surfaced online, a group of people could be seen with sticks and damaging vehicles, including motorbikes and cars. The incident took place on Monday night, the police said.

Lewd comment

According to the police, on Monday, when a woman along with her brother went to a shop in the area, a man, standing nearby, allegedly made a lewd comment. When the woman’s brother strongly objected to it, a heated argument broke out between them, a senior police officer said.

The man decided to take revenge from the woman’s brother. He, along with his group of friends, went to her house to look for her brother, but did not find him there. They looked for him in the area but could not trace him anywhere. While returning, in anger, they started damaging vehicles that were parked on the street, the officer said.

There were around 14 people, including seven juveniles in the group.

They damaged around four-five motorcycles and smashed glasses of six-seven cars. But no one was injured, the officer added. The police said the accused is yet to be arrested.

Based on the complaint of the woman, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer) Sudhanshu Dhama said, “We have registered a case and arrested two men and apprehended two juveniles in this connection.”

Efforts are being taken to nab others also, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/2-minors-among-4-held-for-damaging-vehicles-in-mangolpuri/article32967059.ece
311,2020/10/29,"AAP govt. adds 1,330 seats to nine existing courses at IPU","‘We are trying to help students in hard times’

To deal with the shortfall of higher education seats in colleges in the Capital, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, on Wednesday announced that the Delhi government has added 1,330 new seats in nine existing courses at Guru Gobind Indraprastha (IP) University for the academic session 2020-21.

These seats will be added to IP University-affiliated colleges, to nine existing courses at undergraduate as well as graduate level, the Minister said.

New opportunities

Of the 1,330 seats, maximum seats have been allotted to BTech with a total of 630 seats. The breakdown for the new seats for the nine courses is — BVoc (20 seats), BBA (120 seats), BCom (220 seats), BA economics (120 seats), BCA (90 seats), MBA (60 seats), MSc yoga (15 seats), and MVoc (55 seats).

These additional seats, Mr. Sisodia said, is an effort by the government to offer new opportunities to students during an extremely difficult year.

Equal to new colleges

Mr. Sisodia said that the additional seats are as good as opening 5-6 new colleges. “When a new college opens up in this country, barely 200-odd seats are made available for students. If you look at these new seats, the Delhi government is providing the equivalent of at least 5-6 new colleges for students.

313,2020/10/29,Court acquits Kejriwal in 2016 defamation case by Bidhuri,"BJP MP alleged that CM had defamed him in an interview

A Delhi court on Wednesday acquitted Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a 2016 criminal defamation complaint filed by BJP MP Ramesh Bidhuri.

The complaint was filed against him Mr. Bidhuri, MP from South Delhi parliamentary constituency, under Section 500 (defamation) of the IPC. Mr. Bidhuri alleged that Kejriwal had defamed him in an interview to a news channel.

Mr. Bidhuri had taken objection to Mr. Kejriwal’s statement that though criminal cases were pending against the MP, the Delhi police were not taking any action. “Ramesh Bidhuri ke khilaf bade bade sangeen charges hain, unko pakda aapne [There are serious charges against Ramesh Bidhuri, did you catch him],” the complaint quoted Mr. Kejriwal as telling the interviewer.

“Such defamatory statements have been made with the ulterior motive and wrongful intent to malign and tarnish the image of the complainant,” the complaint said.

The MP claimed that no case was pending against him, and the Chief Minister had defamed him by giving such statements.

He was granted bail on a personal bond of ₹10,000 in July the same year when he appeared before the court on the summons.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/court-acquits-kejriwal-in-2016-defamation-case-by-bidhuri/article32966980.ece
314,2020/10/29,Wisdom to dispel delusion,"From the accounts in the puranas there emerges some kind of explanation on issues such as the cause of creation, cosmology, multi universe theory, galaxy, and so on. In the third Skanda of the Devi Bhagavata purana, Janamejaya confesses to Vyasa that his mind is confused about these matters.

Vyasa tells him that earlier he too had such doubts and that he had approached Narada for clarification. Then Narada had told him that in former times he too had pondered on these matters and then went to Brahma for explanation. In a discourse, Sri K. Srinivasan drew attention to the significance of these weighty questions that have baffled even rishis and realised souls. Janamejaya wants to know about Devi, and how she was born and what is her nature.

How did this entire Brahmanda, not merely the world where we live, come about? Who is the root cause of all this? Who created the Trimurtis, Brahma, Vishnu and Siva? Do they function independently? Who created the celestial beings such as Indra, Agni, Varuna, etc? These deities seem to be bound by Prakriti and gunas and experience joy and sorrow. They seem to be subject to a higher authority when they perform their respective duties. Brahma, Indra and other celestial beings are also bound by time; for, they reign for a specific period that may appear longer in the view of human beings but nevertheless is limited. Janamejaya is also confused about dharma. He wants to know the true characteristics of dharma and what differentiates it from adharma. For, if the devas are inherently endowed with satva guna and aligned to dharma, why is it that they have to fight when attacked by the sinful rakshasas. He hopes the sage will impart wisdom. He hopes to clear the delusion in his mind.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/wisdom-to-dispel-delusion/article32975165.ece
315,2020/10/29,Tracing 19th Century Chinese connections in South India,"A documentary shot across India, Hong Kong and Malaysia by an IIT-Madras professor, traces the Chinese connections of South India specific to the mid-19th Century

Each time period bears many distinct strands of history. The mid-19th Century Tamil Nadu that saw a people who spoke a language unknown to the locals, is one such strand. When Joe Thomas Karackattu, assistant professor at IIT-Madras and faculty in-charge of the China Studies Centre there, went on a trail spanning three countries, namely India, Hong Kong and Malaysia, this particular strand is what he held on to: the Chinese inflow into the South of the Vindhyas. And the starting point of it all was tea.

The Nilgiris, now a major geographical indicator for tea, has an important connection with the Chinese. By visually documenting the lives of those Chinese who travelled to South India, and later made India their home for various reasons, Joe puts his academic research into a comprehensible format: a documentary titled Those 4 Years. The narration is initially built around the arrival of Robert Fortune (the Scottish botanist who is known for introducing plants from China and Japan into British gardens), who had brought with him eight workers from Shanghai to teach native farmers in East Garhwal to grow tea, owing to the high demand around the time. But, it later takes on a different course.

Remnants of the past

Some of those tea manufacturers are believed to have stayed back after their three-year contracts...Joe’s voice-over echoes to a montage of maps, tea plantations and pages from historical documents.

Joe Thomas Karackattu | Photo Credit: special arrangement

The documentary, which is interspersed with interviews and montages of yellowing, old documents, starts with the Ajoo family recounting tales about their forefathers, who had been involved in tea plantations in the South. However, that is not the only thread the researcher follows. A story that runs in parallel is that of the Chinese convicts who were brought to the Nilgiris from the Strait Settlements, as labourers.

“There were many other accounts relating to South India that were yet to be explored. While a lot of people have done work on the history of tea in general.. how it came to parts of northern Assam, and then to South India, and how coffee got wiped out… There was very little work tracing the Chinese connections we had,” says Joe. While the arrival of tea and the British movement of penal labour to different sites in India are points of interest, exploring the specifics of it, Joe thought, would be a valuable contribution. And for this, he had to “burrow deep into the archives”.

“People do have anecdotal references [to share],” says Joe. For instance, at one point in the movie, while debating whether the Chinese had a hand in the production of Lawrence School, Udhagamandalam, a faculty member mentions that when he was a student there, he was often given Chinese coins as pocket money to use in tuck shops. “But, I wanted to go threadbare into where these stories fit in the archives. That’s when I started this journey,” says Joe.

Conceptualising a research product into visual representation is what constituted the three years; the reading that went to it, took longer, adds Joe. “I think, as a researcher, especially as one based in South India, it is very important to tell the stories that have not been told.”

Negotiating tough terrains and unprecedented logistical difficulties — even stopping for food at a local tea shop and getting bits of unanticipated information — gives one life lessons to remain “levelled”. The contrast between the difficult mountain ways of the Nilgiris and the fanciful, opulent Hong Kong skyline, served this purpose.

The second half of the movie in which Joe sets off on a journey to dig out documentary evidence to show the inflow of Chinese convicts from the Strait Settlements, further solidifies all anecdotal references. “For any researcher, that is the thrill!” Whether or not he manages to locate it forms the rest of the latter half.

However, locating these convicts’ descendants and jogging their memory was a challenge. “It is unfair of us to expect them to give us any material information about their fourth or fifth generation ancestors,” says Joe. It is then a researcher’s task to make sense of their powerful oral history through concrete evidence.

316,2020/10/29,Breathing life into Sanghakkali,"A young and enthusiastic team is trying to save the rare art form from extinction

Sanghakkali, traditionally performed by the Namboodiris as a ritual, is one among several rare art forms of Kerala that is fast vanishing. Of the 32 groups that used to perform it not so long ago, today there remains just one.

To save the art from extinction, a team of youngsters created the Kizhiviri Chathira Sangham of Anjoor in Thrissur district. Says Poongad Narayanan Namboodiri, one of the group’s functionaries, “Many veteran practitioners of the art form are no more. Hence, we started this organisation to preserve this tradition.” Trained in Carnatic music at the Chembai Music College, Palakkad, Narayanan is assisted by his cousin Cherumittam Prasanth, a theatre activist. They have a advisor in Dr. P. Sankaranarayanan, former principal of Sree Krishna College, Guruvayur, who was the first to be awarded a Ph.D for his thesis on Sanghakkali in 1992 by the Calicut University.

Family rites

Sanghakkali was performed in Namboodiri homes during the ‘shodasa kriyas’(16 rites) as well as in Shiva temples. The ritual begins with kottichakam pookal, the traditional welcome extended to the team by the head of the family.

Pathram Kotti Aarkkal

After a short invocation, keli , a traditional announcement by a percussion ensemble, is presented along the lines of Kathakali. Next is pathram kotti aarkkal, literally meaning ‘shouting along with drumming on a vessel’. A vatta chembu (large circular copper vessel) is placed on the floor upside down and the performers strike it with their bare hands. Plantain leaves are placed on the base to avoid soot stains on the drummers’ hands. As the drumming continues, two artistes armed with long wooden ladles move in parallel lines on either side of the vessel in sync with the rhythm even as invocatory verses are sung.

Ithikkandappan

Legend has it that naalu padam (four lines), the segment staged next, was a mantra given to the Namboodiris by sage Jangama, enabling them to win a contest organised by Pallibhana Perumal, a ruler of Kerala who had embraced Buddhism. The mantra is believed to be the gist of the four Vedas.

This is followed by a sadya or feast, accompanied by the chanting of ‘curry slokas’ describing the various dishes. Elements of humour are introduced by shouting out for delicacies that are not on the menu. Feast over, the performers go to the pond to wash their hands and as they return, they sing the traditional vanchi pattu. Next is the paana, with meaningful slokas recited to a variety of rhythms such as adantha, mudiyadantha, tripuda etc., as the troupe sits on the stage. At this time, Ithikkandappan, a jester, makes an entry. He symbolises Kaimal, the local ruler.

Flanked by torches and armed with sword and shield, he begins a wordy duel with the group of singers, in an effort to destroy the spiritual ambience. To nullify the negative effect caused in this segment, the bali uzhichil, a dance by Parvati in the guise of a gypsy, is presented next.

A host of funny characters including a drunkard, a grandmother and a fish vendor, make cameo appearances. This may appear paradoxical since fish is taboo for the Namboodiris, but impromptu slokas interpreting the virtues of fish and connecting it cleverly to contemporary events is an occasion for much literary dexterity.

As of now, a team of ten youngsters is being groomed by Narayanan and Prasanth. They have already presented Sanghakkali at many events including at the Soorya festival and on television. According to Sankaranarayanan, a serious study of this art form can throw much light on the political and cultural history of Kerala.e

317,2020/10/29,Kishan Reddy inaugurates revamped RPO,"Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy has called upon all other States to emulate Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in adopting the latest technologies to fast-track the passport verification process through the police department.

Inaugurating the revamped Regional Passport Office (RPO)-Hyderabad virtually from New Delhi along with Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muralidheeran, the Minister pointed out that police verification was a critical element of the passport issuance process.

The External Affairs and Home Affairs Ministries had been encouraging State police departments to quicken the verification and in this TS and AP had ""consistently performed"" setting examples for others to follow. ""Delhi police has also recently decided to use the mPassport Police App”, he said.

Passport rules and application processes have been drastically simplified and access has also expanded rapidly. From 90 odd passport centres in 2016, it has been increased to 507 centres with the successful roll out of post office passport seva kendras. Passport has become an essential travel document and symbol of identity and economic empowerment, he said.

Earlier, people had to travel all the way to the RPO as it was the only centre for the entire State with no online appointments. ""People had to come in the morning and wait for long hours just to enter the office. The system was opaque and the building itself hardly resembled a central government office with poor public amenities"" he observed.

But, now under the guidance of Mr. Muraleedharan, RPO-Hyderabad has upgraded infrastructure with better public facilities with the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) completing the work despite COVID-19 restrictions. “With better infrastructure and accessibility, people can avail passport and other services in a comfortable environment”, he said.

There are 92 passport service centers across the country running in addition to the old passport offices with five passport service centers in TS. Apart from these, passport service centers have also been opened in about 308 post offices including 14 in TS, added the Minister. TS Home Minister Mohd Mohamood Ali, MP Revanth Reddy, MLA G. Sayanna and senior officials were present on the occasion.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/revamped-rpo-launched/article32976217.ece
318,2020/10/29,Sanitation drive extended by 10 days,"GHMC to focus more on 10 circles where flood damage was severe

The special sanitation drive taken up by the GHMC has been extended by 10 more days, to focus more on 10 circles where the flood damage was more.

Citizens seeking garbage clearance in any locality may contact the GHMC emergency control room at 040-21111111, or the mobile contacts of the special sanitation officials appointed circle-wise, a statement from the GHMC informed.

GHMC has collected around 2,000 metric tonnes more garbage on an average from the city during the drive taken up in the aftermath of the floods experienced by various localities recently. Since October 18, when the drive was initiated, up to Wednesday, the corporation’s sanitation workers and staff have ensured removal of a total of 89,134 MT of waste from the six zones of the city, of which 62,996 MT has been moved to the waste processing facility at Jawahar Nagar. In addition, 10,504 MT more of recyclable waste has been separated at the transfer stations.

The special sanitation drive has been taken up upon Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s instructions to clear the 235 colonies, which were under severe impact of flooding during the recent spate of intense rains.

320,2020/10/29,‘Harassed’ woman kills son-in-law,"‘The two were in a relationship before’

A 38-year-old woman allegedly killed her son-in-law at her residence in Sri Nagar Colony of Ramanthapur here on Thursday.

Valluri Anitha, who worked at a catering service, stabbed Peram Naveen Kumar (32) to death. Later, she walked into the Uppal police station and confessed to the crime. She accused Naveen of physically harassing her ever since they were released from jail after being arrested by Meerpet police for abetting the suicide of her daughter Vandana.

Uppal inspector N. Ch. Ranga Swamy said that Naveen’s wife Vandana (19) committed suicide a few months ago after she learnt about her mother’s illicit relationship with her husband.

Both Naveen and Anitha were known to each other for quite some time in their line of work and were in a relationship. Fearing that Naveen would leave her in case he got married to another woman, Anitha performed Vandana’s marriage with the former in November last.

“The marriage was performed with an intention to continue their illegal intimacy, but Vandana was unaware of their plan. When she came to know about her mother’s relationship with Naveen, she warned them to live separately, but in vain. Later, she ended her life,” the inspector said. When Vandana asked Anitha to stay away from her husband, the latter threatened her with dire consequences, he said.

After being released on bail, Naveen started harassing Anitha for ‘ruining’ his life and asked her to settle the case by talking to her other children.

“Unable to bear the harassment, she hatched a plan to kill him and on the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday, she picked up an argument with Naveen and stabbed him to death,” Mr. Ranga Swamy said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/harassed-woman-kills-son-in-law/article32976166.ece

The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) has initiated measures to protect water supply from the impact of recent floods in the city.

As part of the measures, major pipelines of Krishna Ring Mains at Gurram Cheruvu and Nalla Cheruvu have been repaired and restored immediately, and supplies have been released through the mains, a statement from the Water Board informed.

Trunk distribution mains at Kismatpura, Golden Heights across Esi river and pipelines at Nallacheruvu, and Peerzadiguda were washed out, which have been relaid and supply restored, it said. 12 pump houses at Jagadgirigutta, Sainikpuri, Chilkalguda, and other locations, have been repaired and commissioned, besides repairing the electrical transformers at the pump houses.

Water supply sluice valve chambers and sewer manholes have been repaired. Flood affected areas are being supplied through water tankers. So far, a total of 2,530 tanker trips have been made to the areas. A total of 2.3 lakh chlorine tablets and 16.4 metric tonnes of bleaching powder have been distributed. Temporary relief works have been taken up with an expenditure of over ₹2 crore.

As part of relief measures to address sewerage overflow and chokage, sewer cleaning machines have been engaged in two shifts, and 700 workers deployed to attend to sewer line repairs.

A few preventive measures have been planned to control the damage in future. Trunk distribution mains across Musi river at Manchirevula, Kismatpura, and Golden Heights will be laid on pipeline bridges above the highest flood level of the river as permanent measure. Inlet sewer mains of the sewage treatment plants at Nanakramguda, and Gopannapally will be relaid away from the submergence area, as they got drowned in lake water during recent floods.

322,2020/10/29,Investment agent held for cheating,"Diverted victims’ funds with their personal bank accounts by providing fabricated stock holding certificates and fake contact notes

Prashanth Prabhu (38), director of 29K Investment Advisory, Bengaluru, and agent of Manoj Javeri Stock Broking Pvt. Ltd. was arrested by the Hyderabad police on charges of cheating.

In August, one Pradeep Yarlagadda of Film Nagar, lodged a complaint with Central Crime Station (CCS) stating that he and his family members invested ₹7.19 crore with M/s Manoj Javeri Stock Broking of Mumbai for online share trading between 2017 and 2019, after Prabhu’s inducement.

He alleged that Prabhu violated the SEBI rules and without purchasing any shares on their names, he diverted the funds with their personal bank accounts by providing fabricated stock holding certificates and fake contact notes, Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said.

“When Pradeep insisted on returning the principal amount, the accused closed his office and caused wrongful loss to him,” he said.

It was learnt that the accused had lured over 300 people from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Telangana, to invest their money in Manoj Javeri Stock Broking for online trading.

“Prabhu was apprehended in Bengaluru and brought to Hyderabad,” Mr. Mohanty said.

324,2020/10/29,Milad-un-Nabi to be low-key affair,"Focus is on philanthropic activities this time

Muslims of the city are gearing up to celebrate Milad-un-Nabi on Friday, the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad. However, this year, due to the pandemic and recent floods that battered several parts of the city, the celebrations are likely to be a low-key affair.

While funds are raised every year to help those in need, this year many individuals and organisations will be more focused on philanthropic efforts. For instance, FOCUSS and Tanzeem-e-Irshadul Muslimeen will be organising their 11th annual blood donation drive on Friday. These will be at Eidgah Balamrai in Secunderabad and the State Central Library in Afzalgunj.

FOCUSS president Maulana Ahsan bin Mohammed al Hamoomi said that the donated units of blood will be used to help patients diagnosed with thalassemia, or those who find themselves in medical emergencies. The Chishti Foundation in Hyderabad will organise its sixth blood donation camp at GMK Garden in Moti Darwaza, Golconda.

While there will be no procession as such, those who wish to celebrate have been asked by Sunni United Forum, an umbrella body or religious organisations, to move on two-wheelers, and in an orderly fashion, without inconveniencing others and by following the law.

Meanwhile, the United Muslim Forum, on Thursday issued a press release in which they accused France of indulging in ‘Islamophobia’. It also condemned the discourse on Prophet Muhammad. The Forum has requested Muslims to register their protest and send emails to the French Embassy. It also stated that it is requesting mosques in the city to touch upon this subject.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/milad-un-nabi-to-be-low-key-affair/article32976124.ece

327,2020/10/29,KTR reviews flood relief and restoration works,"GHMC officials told to share a helpline number with public

Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao instructed officials to take up repair and restoration works for roads that have been damaged due to flooding during the incessant downpour about two weeks ago.

Repairs should be taken up circle wise on all main roads, he directed officials during a review meeting on Wednesday to discuss the ongoing relief and restoration works in rain-affected areas. Mr. KTR asked GHMC officials to share a helpline number with the public to give information about flood related debris and garbage piling up in any locality. He advised them to rope in resident welfare associations and NGOs for more assistance in providing relief.

He also instructed the officials to install retro fittings to old flyovers for easy drainage of the rainwater.

GHMC officials informed the Minister that distribution of financial assistance to all the flood affected families could be completed within one more day.

During the special sanitation drive taken up after floods, a total of 18,000 metric tonnes of trash have been collected by the Sanitation teams of GHMC. Every day, 3,500 MT additional garbage is being collected, apart from clearance of sludge, they informed. The affected localities are being sprayed with disinfectants to control spread of disease.

328,2020/10/29,Chintalkunta flooding saved the day for Mansurabad lake,"Situation was made worse by the raised median near the Chintalkunta underpass, leading to formation of a virtual swimming pool there

A few days ago, when several localities of the city were flooded during incessant downpour, a video went viral of one person trying his swimming skills on the highway at Chintalkunta area of L.B. Nagar.

Widely shared and spoofed, the video clip represented the severity of the flooding on the Vijayawada highway between Vanasthalipuram and Chintalkunta checkpost, where even parked cars had floated away.

Very few knew that if not on the road, flooding would have happened elsewhere — in Saraswathi Nagar and Hakeemabad colonies. All the water that streamed on to the road from colonies upstream actually belonged to the Pedda Cheruvu at Mansurabad, which was but 500 metres away on the other side of the main road.

Rain water streaming from the colonies surrounding Vanasthalipuram was to enter the storm water drain near Sushma Theatre across the road and empty into the lake. However, the drain was too narrow to hold the flood water which flowed down the road and resulted in inundation.

Another culvert across the road near Abhyudaya Nagar which would have joined the drain on the other side choked, leading to more flooding, officials from GHMC informed. The situation was made worse by the raised median near the Chintalkunta underpass, leading to formation of a virtual swimming pool there.

Attempts are on to widen the storm water drain, by construction of another box drain alongside the existing one. Earth moving machines could be seen working near the drain which was half dug, on Wednesday. Had the drain works been complete, the water would have entered the Pedda Cheruvu, resulting in overflow of the lake, and inundation of surrounding colonies.

Unbearable sewage stench greets any visitor to the lake, who ventures beyond the iron gate enclosing the lake bund within. The gate is installed as entry to a temple inside, which was constructed bang inside the FTL area, in violation of rules. Just a little further away is a mosque, also located in the FTL zone. Two industries, one defunct, apart from several other buildings were clustered inside the lake area, while more than a couple of roads are laid right through the FTL and buffer zones.

On the opposite side, a graveyard juts into the buffer zone, partially encroaching into the FTL too, while an immersion pond constructed inside the lake by GHMC for festival dumping too can be termed as a violation.

Surplus channel of the lake which empties into the Chinna Cheruvu behind Kamineni Hospitals towards Nagole is heavily encroached by colonies such as Saraswathi Nagar, Chandrapuri and others. Officials vouch that there is virtually no surplus course any more.

Pedda Cheruvu is one among the 19 lakes scheduled for beautification and development under the Urban Mission Kakatiya programme. However, no attempt can be seen to divert sewage entering the lake, though a walking track has been laid around it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bb4ch2/article32967156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-MANSURABADPEDDACHERUVU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/chintalkunta-flooding-saved-the-day-for-mansurabad-lake/article32967155.ece
329,2020/10/29,Mastermind in dentist kidnap was bankrupt in Australia,"Accused is a close family member, I trusted him: dentist

A former cryptocurrency investor and financial adviser, who fled from Australia following bankruptcy, was the mastermind behind the kidnapping of a dentist from Kismatpur in Rajendranagar on Tuesday afternoon.

Musthafa, a close relative of the victim Dr. Behjath Hussain (56), hatched a conspiracy with his associate Khalid and their employees to abduct the latter to settle his debts and lead a ‘luxurious life’. He is currently into hospitality industry in Hyderabad and Pune.

A resident of Kismatpur, Dr. Hussain was kidnapped by four persons clad in burqas from his yet-to-be inaugurated clinic at around 1.15 p.m. on Tuesday. He was taken to a house at Yellammabanda of Kukatpally in his own SUV and was later handed over to another ‘team’, who planned to take him to Udupi in Karnataka.

Meanwhile, the Cyberabad police nabbed the first team of kidnappers — Sumit, Akshay, Salman and Vicky — who spilled the beans about the other team. “Soon, we alerted our counterparts in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, and at 6.30 a.m. on Wednesday, Dr. Hussain was rescued by the Anantapur police, who also nabbed the accused,” Commissioner V.C. Sajjanar said.

While trailing the kidnappers, police lost track of them at Kurnool and later near Anantapur. He said that Musthafa demanded the family to pay a ransom of ₹10 crore in bitcoins within 48 hours to release the doctor safely and threatened to not approach police.

The Australian government has initiated action against Musthafa for his illegal dealings in cryptocurrency. Mubashir Ahmed alias Khalid was his business partner there. “Because of their unstable financial position and as they got addicted to a lavish life, the duo decided to kidnap the victim and demand money as they knew his financial position,” Mr. Sajjanar said. Dr. Hussain was also into real estate and owns huge property in Hyderabad.

Dr. Hussain said that Musthafa’s involvement came as a shock to him as he considered the latter as his close family member. “I trusted him and never expected him to go to such extent for money,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/mastermind-in-dentist-kidnap-was-bankrupt-in-australia/article32967131.ece

334,2020/10/29,"Don’t assume COVID-19 has vanished, warns Health dept.","Govt. focussing on measures to avoid second wave of infections

The State government is turning its focus on precautionary measures that need to be continued to avoid a second wave of COVID-19 in Telangana. Urging people not to assume that the coronavirus threat no longer exists, Health department officials have cautioned that any negligence in observing precautions will lead to a surge in cases.

Testing rise and fall

At this point, it cannot be said that fewer positive cases are being recorded in Telangana. The number of cases detected in a day is directly related to the number of tests performed. The highest of 2,500 to 3,000 cases per day were detected towards August-end to September second week when 55,000 to 60,000 people were being examined for coronavirus every day.

Gradually, the number of samples tested has come down. From the past week, around 40,000 samples were tested in a day, leading to detection of 1,200 to 1,500 cases. Testing dropped to nearly 15,000 and 21,000 on Sunday and Monday, respectively. Sunday being a holiday, and festival season, was cited as reason for the drop.

When the tests increased, the number of cases also rose which proved the assumption that fewer cases are being detected as being wrong.

The second wave of COVID-19 cases in European nations is weighing heavily on State government officials. On Tuesday, officials of Health department, Panchayat Raj department, Women and Child Welfare department held a meeting on the pandemic measures.

The officials said that the cases surged in European nations when people there dropped taking precautions. They said if people participate in large gatherings, the cases will surge again in the State.

People are urged to wear mask whenever they step out, wash hands or sanitise whenever they touch a thing or someone, maintain distance of six feet, and avoid crowd and mass gatherings.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/7wwu8i/article32966968.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY28-BATHUKAMMASAREES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/dont-assume-covid-19-has-vanished-warns-health-dept/article32966958.ece

336,2020/10/29,Pollution Control Board seeks DIC’s support to check Periyar pollution,"‘Industries Centre can help find illegal outlets into river’

The State Pollution Control Board has sought the assistance of District Industries Centre (DIC) to check whether effluents from industrial units in Eloor and Edayar were discharged into the Periyar through pipes and drains meant to discharge rainwater.

The move forms part of the directives issued by the National Green Tribunal and the State Level Monitoring Committee on Solid Waste Management appointed by the tribunal to act tough against those found polluting the river. Senior board officials said that the support of the DIC was necessary as the industrial estate comes under the centre.

The board wanted to ascertain whether unauthorised outlets have been directed towards stormwater drains set up for the discharge of rainwater from the premises of industrial units. The presence of such illegal outlets can be checked by digging along the side of the drain, according to its officials.

The SLMC had pulled up the board in its report filed before the Southern Bench of the tribunal while stating that it had failed along with other departments concerned in taking strong action against the Periyar pollution. The committee had suggested the formation of an independent committee having powers to inspect any industry, hotel, high-rises, health care institutions and other establishments on the banks of the river and to collect data necessary for the evaluation from such institutions.

A report filed by the committee before the tribunal in September had suspected the presence of underground pipes starting from industrial units and ultimately discharging industrial waste illegally to the river through the system. The report had included photographs of drains through which industrial effluents reached the river.

337,2020/10/29,Police wary over potential influx of visitors to beaches,"Plans afoot to deploy additional patrolling to regulate visitors

With beaches in the district set to be opened to the public from next month, the police along the coastal areas are keeping their fingers crossed over the potential challenges in regulating visitors in compliance with the COVID-19 protocol.

Among the prominent beaches in the district are Fort Kochi, Cherai, Munambam, Kuzhupilly, Puthuvypin, and Raktheshwari, and they fall within the limits of various police stations and local bodies. They are among the tourist destinations that the State government has allowed to be thrown open to the public from November 1.

“We are anticipating a huge influx of visitors to the beaches considering that it may serve as a safety valve for people smothered by frustrations associated with the pandemic, including being forced to stay indoors. It may be a challenge to maintain order in such an event,” said A.K. Sudheer, Station House Officer, Munambam, which accounts for at least four popular beaches, not to mention the little known access points along the nearly 12-km-long coastline within its limits.

The police said though they were yet to receive any guidelines, including the time when visitors could be allowed to beaches, plans are afoot to deploy additional patrolling and to vacate visitors using public announcement system shortly after dusk.

V.P. Unnikrishnan, secretary, Pallippuram panchayat, said the local body had started removing shrubs and weeds along the beach road to make space for parking and sprucing up street lights.

P.S. Dharmajith, Station House Officer, Njarakkal, said the police expected to have more clarity on the regulations once the CrPC Section 144 ran its course this month-end. However, many people are visiting beaches notwithstanding prohibitory orders.

The Fort Kochi police have been slapping visitors violating prohibitory orders and turning up at the beach with fine under the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance. “We are yet to receive any specific guidelines in the absence of which we will have to devise our own plans to control visitors,” said G.B. Manuraj, Station House Officer, Fort Kochi.

However, the District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) said detailed guidelines had been issued on the permissible number of visitors and vehicles to each beach based on their capacity.

“We have started renovation of washrooms at the Munambam beach maintained by us employing Kudumbashree workers, while the Pallippuram and Kuzhupilly panchayat authorities have been asked to do the same at Cherai and Kuzhupilly beaches respectively,” said S. Vijayakumar, secretary, DTPC.

The Department of Tourism and Heritage Society which maintain facilities at the Fort Kochi beach are working on similar lines.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/4ciib/article32976455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30-KI-CHERAIjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/police-wary-over-potential-influx-of-visitors-to-beaches/article32976456.ece
338,2020/10/29,Police social media cell wins e-governance award,"Recognition for its non-conventional awareness campaigns through social media platforms

Having won accolades from far and wide since its inception just over two years ago, the social media cell of the Kerala Police added yet another feather to its cap by winning the State government’s e-governance award for 2018.

It won the award in the social media category, with separate winners being adjudged in e-citizen service delivery, mobile governance, and e-health categories. The State government instituted the awards for encouraging innovative and people-friendly initiatives by various departments and public sector undertakings.

The social media cell of the State police won the award for its non-conventional awareness campaigns and public interactions through social media platforms. Headed by Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) Manoj Abraham, the social media cell boasts running one of the most popular Facebook pages among police forces across the world. With its humorous memes and sharp and witty repartees to comments, the page now has 15 lakh followers.

“Now, only the Facebook pages of Nepal and Malaysia police remain ahead of us, and we are confident of surpassing them shortly,” said a member of the social media cell.

A team from Microsoft had come visiting to study the police social media initiatives, while its hand washing dance video featuring uniformed cops propagating the safety protocol against COVID-19 had gone viral across the globe shortly after the pandemic broke out.

The State police, which have been using social media extensively to create awareness on law, traffic rules, and the pitfalls of the cyber world, also used it as an effective communication tool to reach out to people during the pandemic.

The social media cell is manned by a six-member team including Kamalanath K.R., Bimal V.S., Santhosh P.S., Arun B.T., Santhosh K., and Akhil P.

The Urban Affairs Directorate and the Mining and Geology Department shared the first prize in e-citizen delivery, Social Survey-Soil Conservation Department in m-governance, National Health Mission in e-learning and e-health, and the Kottayam collectorate for the best web portal. Six best Akshaya centres were also awarded.

340,2020/10/29,"Sivasankar guilty of offence of money laundering, says ED","‘He aided Swapna in layering proceeds of crime on pretext of untainted money’

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) believes that “former Principal Secretary to Kerala Chief Minister, M. Sivasankar, has knowingly assisted Swapna Suresh in layering and usage of proceeds of crime on the pretext of untainted money,” considering the materials it has gathered in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case.

The agency made these revelations in a statement filed on Thursday before the Principal Sessions Court here, which is also the Special Court for trying offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

The ED suspects that the proceeds of the crime, seized by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) from safe lockers of Swapna, the second accused in the case, could belong to Mr. Sivasankar, who had an interest in the finances of Swapna.

The NIA had seized around ₹1 crore from Swapna’s bank locker. The proceeds of the crime were generated by Swapna with the active support of Mr. Sivasankar. The accused remained evasive and non-cooperative when confronted with these facts, the ED said.

The agency said that during the investigation, it was revealed that Mr. Sivasankar was involved in the commission of the offence. WhatsApp chats between the two revealed that she had requested him to intervene with the terminal manager/ airport authorities/ Customs for some work at the airport/clearance of diplomatic baggage without Customs examination.

Chartered accountant P. Venugopal had admitted that Mr. Sivasankar wanted to manage the finances of Swapna and Mr. Venugopal had submitted the WhatsApp chats to that effect, it said.

The agency submitted that Mr. Sivasankar had accepted that he had spoken/sent messages to some officer in April 2019 for the clearance of some diplomatic baggage which was to be examined by the Customs. He made the call following a desperate request made by her. An analysis of the evidence gathered and statements of various persons clearly established that he was guilty of offence of money laundering as defined under Section 3 of the Act, the ED submitted.

M. Sivasankar, who has been arraigned as fifth accused, was given to the custody of the agency for seven days.

‘CM should resign’

Meanwhile, the Opposition’s demand for the resignation of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan got shriller on Thursday with a court in Kochi remanding Mr. Sivasankar in the custody of the ED.

The Congress and the BJP unleashed a wave of protests across the State accusing Mr. Vijayan of allowing economic offenders to harness the heft of his office to facilitate the smuggling of gold in air freight addressed to foreign officials at the diplomatic mission.

The police used water cannons to disperse Youth Congress workers who attempted to storm the Chief Minister’s official residence at Cliff House here. Congress workers held torchlight processions in panchayats and municipal wards.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/o179cq/article32968144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EDs-interrogatGTF7TH0163jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/sivasankar-knowingly-assisted-swapna-in-layering-and-usage-of-proceeds-of-crime-says-ed/article32972161.ece
341,2020/10/29,When overbridges in Kochi tell a sorry tale,"Shoddy condition of Harbour and Venduruthy bridges inconveniences tourists and regular commuters

The shoddy condition of the Harbour Bridge that links Thoppumpady and Willingdon Island, and the Venduruthy Bridge that links Thevara with the island are causing much inconvenience to motorists, especially residents of West Kochi who commute to the city and back.

Personnel attached to the Southern Naval Command, Cochin Port Trust employees and tourists visiting heritage zones in Fort Kochi and Mattancherry too are similarly inconvenienced since the PWD Bridges Wing has not initiated damage-control measures over Venduruthy Bridge which was commissioned in 2011.

This has resulted in concrete chunks wearing off from the surface of the bridge. The structure was not tar-coated, purportedly to prevent potholes developing on the tarred surface. Inadequate lighting over the bridge makes matters worse, posing considerable risk, especially to two-wheeler riders.

Interestingly, the old Venduruthy Bridge built by the British in 1938 remained intact and was used by all types of vehicles till 2011 although a dredger deployed by the Cochin Port Trust lost control and rammed it in two separate incidents that took place a decade and a half ago.

The Harbour Bridge, considered an engineering marvel, was built during the British era in the 1930s, and was used by even buses and lorries till 2001 when the Mattancherry BOT Bridge was commissioned.

PWD sources said that efforts were on to repair gaping potholes that dotted the bridge surface, especially in and around the central span. The bridge developed potholes although it was being used only by light vehicles, proving that repair and reinforcement works done by PWD a couple of years ago was of little use.

The BOT Bridge, now being used by heavy and even smaller vehicles, too is crying for upkeep and resurfacing.

‘Worst of times’

The deteriorating condition of the two bridges that link the city with West Kochi prompted former Mayor K.J. Sohan to recite Charles Dickens, who in A Tale of Two Cities said: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.”

“It is the worst of times for bridges in Kochi, as has been proven by the plight of Palarivattom flyover which is being dismantled for reconstruction. Commuters are having a harrowing time over almost all bridges in Kochi due to potholes and undulations. This shows that the PWD and other agencies did a shoddy job while constructing them. Officials of these agencies must take a cue from bridges built during the British era, which braved the elements and intense traffic for about a century. The condition of the Venduruthy Bridge needs special attention since it is only nine years old. Commuters do not have an alternative since the old bridge is closed for traffic.”

Pedestrian zone mooted

A heritage enthusiast, Mr. Sohan said that the old bridge must be put to good use, by renovating it as a pedestrian zone. It is also a vantage point for angling.

“The CSR funds of corporate firms can well be used for this. I had sent a letter to the British Council a few years ago, suggesting that expert help be made available to conserve the structure.

The Harbour Bridge can become yet another heritage attraction, if a lift or spiral stairway is constructed on its steel vertical frame at the centre, for people to have a bird’s eye view of landmarks in the area using a pair of binoculars. It will especially be of interest for children and youth.”

PWD sources said instructions had been given to regional officials to carry out repair works.

Kundannoor bridge

Yet another bridge that links the city with Willingdon Island, the two-km-long Kundannoor Bridge, too offers a gruelling ride to motorists due to severe undulations that dot its surface.

The PWD (NH wing) is under fire for slack upkeep of the structure.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/1c62nz/article32967647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26KI-POTHOLE-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/when-overbridges-in-kochi-tell-a-sorry-tale/article32967648.ece

People of Androth, an island having the maximum number of residents in Lakshadweep, have warned of intensifying their agitation demanding berthing of Kochi-Lakshadweep ships at the terminal there.

Residents and representatives of different political parties have jointly launched a dharna under the banner of Androth Ship Berthing Action Council raising the demand. Komalam Koya, a member of the council, said that the island was home to around 17,000 native people, while there was a floating population of around 3,000 people. “This makes it the most populated of the 10 islands that constitute Lakshadweep, accommodating around 25% of the population of the isles put together. Ships from the mainland are not berthing at the terminal here for the past one year, citing inadequate depth. This is contrary to facts,” he said.

“There were also efforts to make Androth a transportation hub, since the terminal has well over the minimum 4.90-m depth needed to berth ships. Some places have up to 11-m depth. But ships are avoiding the locale. This results in passengers from the isle being forced to board fishing vessels to embark and alight ships. The ongoing agitation is aimed at prevailing on Lakshadweep Development Corporation Ltd. (LDCL) and other agencies concerned to pro-actively intervene in the issue,” Mr. Koya said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/41dlu9/article32967635.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28ki-Berthing,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/androth-islanders-on-the-warpath/article32967636.ece

344,2020/10/29,Corpn. e-governance project fails to take off,"Status report yet to be submitted to IKM

Nearly ten years after it was conceived, the Kochi Corporation’s e-governance project has fallen flat, despite steps taken to pull it back onto its feet a few months ago.

In June, the corporation had passed an agenda to hand the entire project over to the Information Kerala Mission (IKM).

“But nearly four months later, a status report on the existing system and the work that is left to be done has not yet been submitted to IKM,” said Mayor Soumini Jain.

The report was to have been submitted by the Corporation Secretary, she said. After the then Secretary went into quarantine, another official was given additional charge. The corporation’s Deputy Secretary has recently taken charge as the secretary.

Since a lot of data that was stored on a rudimentary e-governance system set up by TCS earlier would have to be transferred to the IKM software, existing work would have to be quantified first, the Mayor said. The few modules that TCS had made functional were operational now. Opposition councillors had merely raised a hue and cry a few months ago asking for a shift to IKM without any real substance to their argument, she said.

Councillor’s take

“Tax payments and submission of applications, however, are still to be done at the corporation office itself,” said K.V.P. Krishnakumar, councillor representing Ernakulam South. Last month saw crowds at the office counters to complete payments before September 30, he said. In the wake of COVID-19 restrictions, the Janasevana Kendram was shifted from the office premises to the nearby Yathra auditorium.

“The council’s term has nearly come to an end, but it has failed to ensure completion of a project that makes services easily available even in panchayats,” said K. J.

345,2020/10/29,"COVID positive pregnant women at high risk, say health officials","180 active cases in district

While over 380 pregnant women have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the district so far, most of them were asymptomatic, though they remain at high risk, according to health officials.

So far, 387 pregnant women have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the district. Of them, around 180 cases are still active, and the others have recovered, said Dr. Sivadas M. G., Reproductive and Child Health Officer. Most pregnant women have been asymptomatic, he pointed out. Two deaths of COVID-19 positive pregnant women were reported in the district and both were attributed to pneumonia, he said. “Since their immunity is low, chances are high that the virus might replicate more vociferously, and lead to a more severe form of the infection in some cases,” he said.

A 29-year-old from Thiruvananthapuram was in the fifth month of her pregnancy when she tested positive for the virus in Ernakulam in July. She was admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital and spent 23 days, including a few in the ICU, recovering. “Her oxygen saturation levels were low and her condition was complicated by an existing heart condition. She delivered a healthy baby a few days ago,” her husband said. They suspect that both of them had contracted the infection from another hospital in Thiruvananthapuram that they had visited for a check-up, he said.

Susceptible to infections

Immunologically, pregnant women are susceptible to infections, not just from the coronavirus, placing them at high risk, said Dr. Prathibha Chandrasekharan, gynaecologist at the Ernakulam General Hospital. The number of women seeking antenatal check-ups at the hospital had fallen to about one-third of pre-COVID-19 figures, she said. But that does not mean that they were not getting their check-ups, she added. “It is possible that they chose to visit smaller clinics or health centres closer to their homes, rather than visit a crowded hospital. ASHA workers have also consistently been monitoring the health of pregnant women in their areas,” she said. Women who visit the hospital have been asked to wear masks inside their homes and strictly follow physical distancing and hand hygiene protocol, she said.

A first-line treatment centre for pregnant women was set up on the SCMS College premises at Muttom. Most women choose to remain at home now, but the 80-bed FLTC is available for women who might not have the facilities to remain in isolation at home, Dr. Sivadas said. Around 45 beds at the FLTC are occupied. If they develop symptoms, they are immediately transferred to the MCH, he added.

In the early phase of the pandemic, complications in pregnant women were few, but now more women were reporting complications including pneumonia, said Dr. Shobha Pillai, gynaecologist and associate professor at the MCH.

A challenge

Dr. A. Fathahudeen, nodal officer for COVID-19 treatment at the MCH, said that they had seen about three severe cases of the infection in pregnant women.

The impact of antivirals like remdesivir on the foetus was not yet clear and such medication, which is given to seriously ill COVID patients, is usually avoided while treating pregnant women, he said. In a more recent case at the hospital, a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy and with very low oxygen saturation was delivered of a healthy baby via C-section to give her a better shot at fighting the disease with the antivirals, he said.

In women who are in the early stages of pregnancy, CT-scans and X-ray imaging are usually avoided, which is another challenge while treating pregnant women with COVID, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/covid-positive-pregnant-women-at-high-risk-say-health-officials/article32967624.ece

347,2020/10/29,300 acres of fallow land in Panayikkulam to be brought under cultivation,"About 300 acres in Panayikkulam, near Aluva, which has been lying fallow for more than 30 years, will be brought under cultivation, thanks to the newly formed ‘Farmers’ Club’.

The Karichal paddy collective (paada sekharam) is under the ownership of more than 50 farmers, who have not been able to raise crops in the field for the last several decades. Paddy was not cultivated because it was not profitable to do so for various reasons, ranging from high labour cost to lack of availability of workers.

However, a group of farmers with the help of the Cooperative Farmers Bank at Kongorpilly and the Krishi Bhavan has decided to bring around 100 acres under paddy cultivation in the initial stage. Work on planting paddy in the remaining 200 acres is also being taken up.

348,2020/10/29,A roving farmer brings paddy farming to Perumbavoor,"For the last 12 years, Samuel Mathew has been undertaking “Kuttanad style” of farming on fallow land in various places

The Perumbavoor municipality has brought 20 hectares of fallow land under paddy cultivation, thanks to a 52-year-old roving farmer from Kuttanad.

Samuel Mathew, who hails from an agricultural family and owns nearly 40 acres of paddy farms in his native Kuttanad region, has been hopping around local bodies for the last 12 years, undertaking what he describes as the “Kuttanad style” of paddy farming on fallow land. Before launching his initiative in Perumbavoor, he has been to Kattanam, Mavelikkara, and Pathiyoor, all in Alappuzha district.

“We have so far arranged 20 hectares of land from owners on a five-year lease for the project being undertaken as part of the fallow land farming scheme being promoted by the State government under the Subiksha Keralam project. The land has been remaining fallow for over two decades,” said Sathi Jayakrishnan, chairperson of Perumbavoor municipality, which has been largely devoid of paddy farming.

It is a win-win situation both for the farmer and the landowners. The landowners will get paddy royalty of ₹2,000 per hectare and another ₹5,000 per hectare for facilitating fallow land farming, both one-time payments.

“The farmer will get ₹17,000 towards labour charges for each farming season and free seeds of 80 kg per hectare, using the ₹10 lakh set apart by the municipality for promoting agriculture. We are planning to increase the extent of land under farming to 50 hectares gradually,” said Valsamma K.P., agriculture field officer, Krishi Bhavan, Perumbavoor.

Starting from the third year, the lessee will pay the landowners ₹1,500, ₹2,000 and ₹2,500 per acre annually.

“We will deploy the machines and manpower for sowing and harvesting with our takeaway solely being the paddy produced. Often enthused by the output during our five-year term, the landowners take back the land to undertake farming on their own, ignorant about the many challenges involved. Soon they run out of steam and the land ends up fallow again,” said Mr. Mathew.

However, there have been instances where the lease period was extended beyond five years.

Mr. Mathew is keeping his fingers crossed about the output from Perumbavoor municipality during the harvest season scheduled for early next year, citing how the soil is not as fertile as in Kuttanad and has greater sand content.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/gfxhri/article32967592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28ki-Land,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a-roving-farmer-brings-paddy-farming-to-perumbavoor/article32967593.ece

350,2020/10/29,Caring for the elderly in pandemic times,"‘Vayokshema’ call centre proves a boon for senior citizens

The ‘Vayokshema’ call centre opened by the Social Justice Department in the city under its Grand Care project is proving to be a big relief for many elderly people. Within just one-and-a-half months, the call centre team has managed to make 44,300 direct calls to the target group and enquire about their well-being. The centre helps the elderly address their personal issues and remain connected with the authorities to get information on latest government welfare programmes.

The project makes headway at a time when many elderly citizens are badly in need of personal support following the outbreak of COVID-19.

According to social Justice Department officials, the call centre is a trustworthy place for the elderly to approach to solve their physical, mental or emotional problems. The District-level Senior Citizen Cell is also monitoring the activities of the centre.

“Our task during the launch time was to popularise the service and prompt maximum elderly citizens to approach us in case of any legal, medical or financial requirements. Since September this year, we have been doing the phone interaction apart from visiting the needy to assure them spot relief,” says M. Indhu, one of the technical assistants at the call centre near the Iqra Hospital. She says that the call centre has so far received over 3,000 calls from senior citizens seeking solutions for various personal issues.

In Kozhikode district, the target group comprises about

2,47,000 elderly people. Personal details of the majority of the elderly are available with call centre officials to contact them occasionally and enquire about their well-being. As there are officials from the Maintenance Tribunal as well with the centre, legal support is also available for them. There are now 20 professionals who work in two shifts to handle daily interactions at the call centre.

Medicine supply

On the basis of calls, the call centre team is now working on a separate project to supply essential medicines to some of the needy in their list. The support of sponsors will be sought to purchase medicines and deliver them. There are also plans to purchase supportive equipment like wheelchairs for financially backward members in the group.

Officials with the Social Justice Department say the State-level project is likely to be linked with a similar national project under the Union government for better reach.

Plans are afoot to take up geotagging of senior citizens’ locations and assure them a software-based support all the time using an exclusive app. Till then, they can contact the district-level cell between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. on 04952-377911.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/9wt7h6/article32976007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29ki-Elderly,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/caring-for-the-elderly-in-pandemic-times/article32976008.ece

All policemen, including the Station House Officer, at the Mukkom police station were quarantined after seven of them tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Thursday. It is for the first time that all personnel in a local police station are being quarantined in the district.

Police officials from Thamarassery, Koduvally and Thiruvambady stations have been given additional charge to ensure uninterrupted functioning of the Mukkom station.

However, situation is not different in other rural and city stations too where personnel have been infected. The Armed Reserve camp of the Kozhikode Rural police had reported 49 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Recently, seven policemen at the Elathur police station too had been tested positive.

Considering the increasing number of COVID cases among policemen, the number of personnel who appear for station duty has been reduced to a great extent.

354,2020/10/29,UGC norm violation alleged in one-year LLM course,"Explanation sought from Calicut University VC and Higher Education Council

The University Grants Commission (UGC) has sought comments from the Vice Chancellor, Calicut University, and the State Higher Education Council over the alleged violation of guidelines in the running of a one-year LLM course.

This follows a representation filed by K. Sasikala, a lawyer from Mavoor in Kozhikode district, who alleged that the Department of Law at the university had violated the mandatory provisions of the UGC’s directives issued in 2012 for the introduction of the programme.

Ms. Sasikala, who had enrolled for the course, pointed out that earlier the LLM course was of two-year duration, and the one-year course was launched in the self-financing stream last year. Students were upset about the quality of teaching, unavailability of sufficient infrastructure, and insufficient classroom teaching hours in the first semester itself, she said.

Ms. Sasikala also claimed that only some students were barred from appearing for the internal exams for want of attendance without holding the mandatory hours of classroom sessions. She said this step had been questioned in the Kerala High Court through a petition. She also pointed out that the rules framed by the university in 2017 for the running of the course too had violated UGC guidelines. The court is learnt to have sought a reply from the Vice Chancellor, Registrar, head of the Department of Law, and the UGC. Meanwhile, the university scrapped the one-year programme from this academic year and reverted to the two-year programme.

M.K. Jayaraj, Vice Chancellor, told The Hindu on Wednesday that he was yet to see the mail from the UGC. He said he would examine the issue and act accordingly.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/ugc-norm-violation-alleged-in-one-year-llm-course/article32966961.ece
355,2020/10/29,Dressing up the stars,"Designer Chaitanya Rao on his latest projects and collaborating with Tamil cinema’s leading actors for their films

Chaitanya Rao has a grouse. Most people know him as a designer. “But only few know me as a costume designer,” says Chaitanya who has just finished working on Reunion, one of the stories in the recently-released Putham Pudhu Kalai, a collection of five short films on Amazon Prime. Reunion saw him working with Leela Samson, Andrea Jeremiah and Sikkil Gurucharan.

Since it was shot during various stages of lockdown, sourcing garments was a challenge. “Everything was shut. Luckily, I had managed to get a few options from Hyderabad and the rest were borrowed out of Andrea and Leela mam’s wardrobe,” he laughs.

This particular short was directed by Rajiv Menon. “I felt like life had come a full circle because I first started out as an assistant costume designer for Minsara Kannavu, which was also directed by Rajiv,” says Chaitanya, who wants to work on a period film someday.

With 50-plus movies to his credit, the city-based designer has done it all; from fixing a garment in a few hours to redoing an entire look for a song in one night. “When it comes to creating your own fashion line, you have the luxury of taking three to four months to design a collection. The whole dynamic changes when you are working on a film,” he says.

He feels that it is important to remember to not use the entire collection on an actor just because one is the costume designer for a film. “What you create should incorporate the brief of the director while keeping in mind the actor, choreographer and your aesthetics,” he explains.

The time factor is also a major difference between the two worlds he straddles. “Fashion is what you want to showcase: you are looking at one season ahead. But for films, it is important to create a timeless look because sometimes they can take up to two years to get completed,” he says. With a crop of newcomers entering the world of styling, the experienced designer has a word of caution: With a lot of brands now available in the city, it might be easier to source clothes and accessories but make sure the look you put together doesn’t look like something you’ve picked off a store.”

Despite being part of the fashion and film industry for nearly two decades and having worked with popular actors like Trisha, Asin, Simran, Madhavan and Mahesh Babu, Chaitanya believes there is no room for complacency. “You have to constantly make sure there is a freshness to their look. They can’t end up looking like clones,” says the costume designer, who is currently on the Nayanthara-starrer Netrikann and an untitled project with Jayam Ravi and Taapsee Pannu.

In Netrikann, Nayanthara plays a visually challenged girl, so her clothes had to be practical. “In movies, we usually use a lot of fitted outfits with zips at the back and other such details but here these had to be clothes that are easy to slip on and are fluid,” he explains.

Even little details like the wristwatch worn by Nayanthara had to be researched; Chaitanya sourced an easy-to-slip-on watch from the US. “It has a button that opens the glass on top so the wearer can touch and feel the time. These are things we don’t realise and take for granted. Hopefully, after the film releases, it’ll make a difference for the visually challenged here,” he adds.

His calender is packed. Juggling a couple of films at the same time plus attending to clients is demanding, he confesses, adding, “I do not want to let any of them down, even if it means working from 4 am to 9 pm everyday, which is my current operating schedule.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/mdwtui/article32971948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29mpchetan3,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/dressing-upp-the-stars/article32971952.ece
356,2020/10/29,"Quick decision on 7.5 % quota needed, says HC","The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday hoped that the Governor would take a decision at the earliest with regard to the Bill on implementing 7.5% horizontal reservation for government school students, who cleared National Eligibility-Cum-Entrance Test (NEET), in medical admissions.

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi made the remark while hearing a batch of public interest litigation petitions which sought a direction to the State to implement reservation for government school students as recommended by the commission headed by retired High Court Judge P. Kalaiyarasan.

The Bench was informed by Advocate General Vijay Narayan that the Governor needed three to four weeks to take a decision on the Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Courses in Medicine, Dentistry, Indian Medicine and Homeopathy on Preferential Basis to the Students of Government Schools Bill, 2020.

When the judges asked why there was a delay in taking a decision in this regard, the Advocate General referring to Article 361 of the Constitution submitted that protection had been given to the constitutional authority and the Governor was not answerable to any court for exercise and performance of his powers and duties.

The judges observed that, “No doubt Article 361 gives protection to the constitutional authority. However, in the given circumstances, a decision has to be taken, taking into consideration the future of the government school students, who are invariably from marginalised and poor sections, as soon as possible as provided under Article 200 of the Constitution of India (Assent to Bills).”

The court observed that the Bill was unanimously passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly on September 15 and sent for assent to the Governor the same day. However, it was pending for almost two months.

On October 16, NEET results were published. Though it was claimed that around 400-500 students from government schools cleared NEET, the reality was that only single-digit number of students would be qualified for admission to medical courses as per the committee report. Since the introduction of NEET in 2017, only 14 students from government schools got admission to medical courses, the judges said.

“When.. present kind of situation arises, a different approach has to be taken by the courts in the interest of the public. It is well settled law that ‘extraordinary situation requires extraordinary remedies’. When public interest requires, this court has to do its constitutional duties and address the situation. However, this court is of the opinion that such a situation would not arise to pass any order in this matter,” the judges said.

The case was adjourned till November 2.

Earlier, the government informed the court that until a decision was taken by the Governor, the prospectus for admissions would not be issued.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/2mqv82/article32978382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA30MADURAIBENCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/quick-decision-on-75-quota-needed-says-hc/article32975822.ece

358,2020/10/29,"Relay road, say residents and stage protest","Residents of Sambangi Street here staged a protest against the Kariyapatti town panchayat on Thursday seeking to include their street for re-laying of road.

They said that the road that had been partially laid several years back.

While the adjacent Shenbagam Street has been given a fresh layer, officials ignored this street. Police officials pacified them saying that they would take up their cause with the local body.

“The town panchayat finalised tender for several lakhs to re-lay roads in the town. But there is no transparency on selection of works,” complained Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam town secretary, R. K. Senthil.

Mr. Senthil, who is the former councillor of ward 12 under which Sambangi street falls, alleged that influence of ruling party was behind selection of roads to be re-laid.

M. Velmurugan, 45, a resident of the street, said that several petitions had been given to the local body seeking road work.

“However, the officials were reluctant to take up work in our street,” he said.

Executive Officer of Kariyapatti Town panchayat, M. Manikandan, said that the delay in taking up work in Sambangi Street was due to lack of drainage facility.

“We wanted to ensure proper drainage facility so that the road would last long. We are going to take up work in this street too,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/road/article32975352.ece
359,2020/10/29,Broiler farmers find the going tough,"Payment from contractors hardly enough to cover overheads, they say

A. Palaniammal, a 33-year-old resident of T. Kovilpatti near Tiruvadavur in Madurai district, has abandoned paddy and jasmine cultivation around seven years back due to water shortage. “I became a poultry farmer and started rearing chicks on a contract basis for private companies, as this venture appeared to be highly lucrative,” she said.

However, my hopes were dashed as the business was not profitable and I found it difficult to repay bank loans, she said. “This is mainly because of low wages paid by the companies for rearing the chicks. They pay us a pittance and it hardly covers the cost of production,” she said.

Like Ms. Palaniammal, many poultry farmers in the district, who have signed agreements with private companies for rearing broiler chicks, have a grouse against the private firms. So, farmers affiliated to Madurai District Broiler Contract Farmers’ Association have decided not to rear the next batches of chicks until the companies decide to pay decent wages, she said.

Association president M.S. Arun Prasad said the companies supplied hundreds of chicks, along with feed and medicines, which were essential for their growth. The farmers have to set up infrastructure for raising the chicks and deliver the chicken to the private companies after around 40 days. “While the cost of rearing a chicken costs around ₹11 a kg, the companies pay us only ₹4. But, on the other hand, the companies’ profit margin is up to 40%,” he said.

The cost of coconut coir,e essential for rearing the chicks, has drastically increased in the recent years, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, said A. Manivasagam, a poultry farmer.

The farmers also have to pay for electricity, labour and water. “Most farmers have borrowed heavily for setting up the infrastructure,” said Ms. Palaniammal.

Due to poor returns, many were are unable to repay their debts, said A. Ramadoss, treasurer of the association. “The farmers reared chicks even through the COVID-19 pandemic. So the companies must increase the wages so that this business is sustainable,” he said.

Mr. Prasad said the current batch of chicks being raised by farmers would be supplied to the companies only if they paid ₹12 a kg. “But the farmers will not rear the next batch of chickens unless the companies paid ₹15 a kg,” he added.

Farmers from Dindigul, Theni and other southern districts have also decided not to rear the next batch of chicks unless the companies paid higher wages.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/le9bb/article32975296.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MACITY-POULTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/broiler-farmers-find-the-going-tough/article32975297.ece

The first lighthouse in Tirunelveli district, which has a 49-km-long coastline between Periyathaazhai and Koottapuli, was commissioned at Kooththenkuzhi on Thursday.

Minister of State for Shipping Mansukh Laxmanbhai Mandavia inaugurated the 45-metre-tall beacon built at a cost of ₹5.50 crore through videoconferencing. Tirunelveli MP S. Gnanathiraviam and Radhapuram MLA I.S. Inbadurai remotely participated in the event.

The Directorate of Lighthouses and Lightships under the Ministry of Shipping built the lighthouse located 51 metres above sea level.

Mariners and fishermen, who use two lighthouses at Kanniyakumari and Manappad, will have one more beacon light — visible up to 20 nautical miles — to guide them on high seas. While the Kanniyakumari lighthouse is located 39 km away to the south, the Manappad facility is 40 km to the north. Hence, the Kooththenkuzhi lighthouse will bridge the 79-km gap between the two.

Two other lighthouses in the region are at Muttom (68 km in the south) and Thoothukudi (93 km in the north). Now, five lighthouses will guide fishers and mariners between the 161-km stretch from Thoothukudi and Muttom, with the facility available every 32 km.

Work on Kooththenkuzhi lighthouse with lift began in August last after the district administration allotted 3,500 sqft land and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change gave its mandatory final approval.

Although fishermen of the district are opposed to the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project, they say they use the red lights blinking atop the reactor domes at a height of about 100 metres to identify the coast.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dp39z2/article32973804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA30-LIGHTHOUSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tirunelveli-gets-its-first-lighthouse/article32973805.ece

Workers of Sandal Fireworks unit in Thulukkankurichi near here had a providential escape as an explosion was reported in the unit in the early hours of Thursday before they reported for duty.

One room was razed to ground in the blast that was reported at around 6.30 a.m.

No one was injured in the accident, according to police sources. Fire and Rescue Services personnel put out the flames to prevent the fire spreading to other working sheds.

An inspection by Controller of Explosives, Pandey, of Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organisation who inspected the scene of accident found that the unit had been illegally leased out to three different entities.

“Besides, our officials found that banned fireworks goods like joined lars were being manufactured at the unit,” Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives, K. Sundaresan, said.

The officials suspected that the workers could have left unused chemical mixture at the mixing room violating the safety norms.

“The left-over chemical mixture could have undergone overnight chemical reaction and decomposition could have triggered the explosion. Besides, stocking of filled chorsa would have added to the impact of the blast that led to razing down of the building,” Mr. Sundaresan said.

The license of the unit would be suspended for blatant violation of safety norms.

368,2020/10/29,Corruption is comparable to indulging in anti-national activities: Rajendra,"Deputy Commissioner urges government servants to discharge their duty without expecting favour

Comparing corruption to indulging in anti-national activities, Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra on Wednesday asked government employees to be introspective imagining them in the place of the common man while discharging their duty.

Such an introspection or experiences of harassment at government offices before one joined the government service should guide government servants to deliver service without expecting anything in return, Dr. Rajendra said, speaking at the Vigilance Awareness Week observation at his office.

The Vigilance Awareness Week with the theme “Vigilant India-Prosperous India” is being organised by the administration in association with the District Legal Services Authority and the Bar Association, Mangaluru.

The Deputy Commissioner said that government servants should ensure that all government schemes reach the targetted groups without there being any corruption. Leading a life of honesty would inspire hundreds of people, he told officers and employees urging them to discharge their duties without expecting any favour. Dr. Rajendra also cautioned government servants stringent action would be initiated if any lapses in their working was found.

Senior Civil Judge and District Legal Service Authority’s member secretary A.G. Shilpa said that every government servant should also create legal awareness besides following the law of the land. Demanding and accepting bribe, accepting favours in other forms, misusing public office, etc., were offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, she said. General public may complain to the Anti Corruption Bureau in Mangaluru on Ph: 0824-2483000, ACB Inspector of Police on Ph: 9480806291 or the Superintendent of Police on Ph: 9480806231, she said.

370,2020/10/29,NHAI asked to rectify defects at NH 66-Ullal Road Junction,"With frequent road accidents, including Tuesday’s death of a couple riding a two-wheeler exposing the chinks in the construction of the flyover on National Highway 66 at Thokkottu Junction, Police Commissioner Vikash Kumar Vikash on Wednesday directed the National Highways Authority of India to immediately address the issue.

After inspecting the Ullal Main Road-NH 66 Flyover Junction where the couple on the motorcycle came under the wheels of a container truck on Tuesday, Mr. Vikash told The Hindu that the road geometry looked unscientific prima facie. No traffic from service roads should directly be allowed to enter or cross a highway; however, in this particular case, vehicles were allowed to cross NH 66 directly from the Thokkottu service road towards Ullal Main Road, he said.

“I have told NHAI that it should ensure no accidents take place at Ullal Junction due to improper construction,” he said. Priya Fernandes (32) died on the spot in Tuesday’s accident, while her husband Rayan Fernandes died in a private hospital.

While NHAI was directed to explore means to improve the junction geometry, the Mangaluru City Traffic Police would arrange for erection of speed breakers at the joining point of the Thokkottu service road with NH 66 near Ullal Junction, the Commissioner said. The immediate merger of traffic from the service road with that on the highway was incorrect, Mr. Vikash said and added that the police and NHAI would address issues one by one.

He said that drivers of vehicles moving on the flyover cannot see vehicles coming from the service road and joining the highway immediately after the flyover’s down-ramp. Thus, both would be in danger, he said and added that such a scenario should be avoided.

The Commissioner said that he was aware of the existence of the U turn ahead of the flyover and he would discuss the matter with NHAI and traffic experts shortly.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/ag6cbp/article32967349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29MNTHOKKOTU1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/nhai-asked-to-rectify-defects-at-nh-66-ullal-road-junction/article32967350.ece

In a memorandum submitted to the Panchayat Development Officer of Guthigar Gram Panchayat, the samiti said that Balpa-Guthigar link road has not been asphalted for years now. People have been putting up with the poor condition of the road which has potholes, craters and worn-out stretches. People have been using this road with great difficulty. The samiti said that people in Mogra, Ballakka and Kamila areas have been deprived of infrastructure due to connectivity issues. A rivulet connecting Mogra with Kamila required a bridge. Though it is a long pending demand of the people, elected representatives and the government have not responded positively. About 150 families in Mogra and Kamila lose connectivity with the mainland, especially during the rainy season, due to the absence of a bridge on the Mogra rivulet.

373,2020/10/29,Corpn. to stop receiving solid waste from outside civic bodies after three months,"It will accept only segregated waste from three urban local bodies, 15 gram panchayats till then

The council of the Mangaluru City Corporation in its meeting here on Wednesday decided that solid waste from three outside urban local bodies and 15 gram panchayats will not be received at its compost plant at Pachchanady after three months.

It decided that solid waste from those civic bodies, including Ullal City Municipality, Bantwal Town Municipality, Kotekar Town Panchayat and 15 gram panchayats, should be accepted at Pachchanady till the next three months only, if those bodies sent segregated waste.

The council decided to write to them to pay their solid waste processing fee due to be paid to the corporation for long.

Raising the solid waste management issue at the landfill site of the corporation at Pachchanady, Leader of the Opposition Congress Abdul Rauf wanted to know what action had been taken by the corporation against officials who, according to him, were responsible for the garbage slip at the landfill site in August 2019 affecting many families and farmland.

Reacting to this, a BJP councillor Sudhir Shetty Kannur said that there was no point in blaming the officials for it as civic bodies located outside Mangaluru have been sending their garbage to Pachchanady for a decade thus, contributing for the increase in garbage at the landfill site. This arrangement should be controlled, he added.

Mr. Shetty said that as those civic bodies received grants from the government, they should make their own arrangements for processing solid waste generated in their jurisdiction. They should be responsible for disposing of waste generated by them.

Seeking a total ban on solid waste being received at Pachchanady from outside civic bodies, the former Mayor and Congress councillor M. Shashidhar Hegde urged the council to pass a resolution. Mr. Rauf urged Mayor Diwakar to give a ruling banning receiving solid waste from outside.

The Mayor and Commissioner of the corporation Akshy Sridhar said that the corporation cannot impose a total ban with immediate effect. Those bodies should be given some time, at least three months, to make alternative arrangements to process their waste. Till then, only segregated waste should be accepted at Pachchanady.

The corporation Commissioner told the council that in the case of garbage slip, the High Court of Karnataka has not passed any order to initiate action against officials on the ground that they were responsible for it. It has asked the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board to reply in the matter, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/gg69y6/article32967320.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29MNCORPORATIONMEETING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/corpn-to-stop-receiving-solid-waste-from-outside-civic-bodies-after-three-months/article32967321.ece
374,2020/10/29,"51 apartments, 3,500 houses in city start converting wet waste into compost","We are receiving applications from some seeking rebate in solid waste management cess, says official

As many as 51 apartments and 3,500 houses in the city have begun making compost from wet waste now, according to Environment Engineer of the Mangaluru City Corporation Madhu S. Manohar.

He told the council meeting of the corporation here on Wednesday that the civic body has begun receiving applications from some of them seeking rebate in the solid waste management cess being collected while they paid property tax.

Short of vehicles

Replying to questions from councillors, he said that Antony Waste Handling Cell Pvt. Ltd., which is handling solid waste for the corporation as its contractor, has deployed 18 compactors (large vehicles) against the requirement of 23 vehicles as per the terms of the contract for transporting solid waste to the compost plant of the corporation at Pachchanady.

The contractor is short of seven small vehicles against the requirement of 84 such vehicles to transport waste from the doorsteps of houses and other establishments.

Mayor Diwakar had at a meeting here on Tuesday instructed the contractor to meet the shortage of vehicles within two days by outsourcing them. If the company failed to do it, the corporation should arrange for those vehicles and deduct the rental amount for hiring those vehicles from the account of the contractor, he had said.

Dry waste

Naveen R. Souza, a councillor from the Congress, urged the corporation to collect dry waste daily along with wet waste.

As the civic body is now collecting dry waste once in a week, that is, on Fridays, dry waste is piling up in large apartments, he said.

He suggested that the corporation opt for decentralised waste processing by installing organic waste converters in identified places for composting wet waste.

Smart City projects

Referring to Smart City Mission projects, Whip in the council Premananda Shetty said that Mangaluru Smart City Project Ltd. should place the additional project proposals before the council for a discussion and approval before placing them before the company’s decision-making committees for approval.

Mr. Diwakar said that a special meeting will be called to discuss the Smart City projects.

376,2020/10/29,Sangh Parivar to counsel people against revenge crime,"The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, Bajrang Dal and the Hindu Jagaran Vedike will jointly undertake counselling people who have a tendency to take revenge through use of criminal force in general, and particularly, the alleged associates of three persons who were recently murdered, so as to prevent revenge crimes in the region.

“It is sad to hear about the murders of Kishan Hegde (in Udupi), Sampath (in Sullia) and Surendra Bhandary (in Bantwal) as a result of financial dispute, their alleged association with the underworld, gang war and personal enmity. We have decided to act and stop any further murders of Hindu youths on account of revenge,” Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s Mangaluru Divisional Secretary Sharan Pumpwell told reporters here on Wednesday.

Hindu Jagaran Vedike honorary State president Rajashekarananda Swami said that revenge killing is not a solution to a problem. Disputes should be solved amicably and under lawful means. “We will make an effort to reform such youths, involve them in the cause for the country and stop them from creating unrest in society,” he said.

If the issue is not addressed now, these youths would turn into dons and become a nemesis to society in the coming days. “The task on hand is challenging and a sensitive one. We are making a beginning,” he said.

The seer said that this work of reformation will not come in the way of the ongoing investigation in the three murders and other criminal cases registered in this connection.

377,2020/10/29,Govt hikes ethanol price by up to ₹3.34/ltr,"The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the price of ethanol extracted from sugarcane juice to ₹62.65 per litre from current ₹59.48 per litre

The government on Thursday hiked the price of ethanol extracted from sugarcane for doping in petrol by up to ₹3.34 per litre as it looked to ramp up the programme that has benefited farmers and also helped cut down oil import bill.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the price of ethanol extracted from sugarcane juice to ₹62.65 per litre from current ₹59.48 per litre for the supply year beginning December 2020.

The rate for ethanol from C-heavy molasses has been increased from ₹43.75 per litre to ₹45.69 per litre and that of ethanol from B-heavy to ₹57.61 per litre from ₹54.27 per litre, I&B Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters here.

India, which is 85% dependent on imports to meet its oil needs, allows doping of up to 10% ethanol in petrol with a view to cutting oil import and vehicular emissions as also offer a remunerative source for sugarcane farmers to sell their produce.

The steady rise in the price of ethanol paid by oil marketing companies has led to ethanol procurement jump to 195 crore litre in 2019-20 (December 2019 to November 2020) from 38 crore litre in 2013-14.

Oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) will bear GST and transportation cost on the ethanol procured for doping in petrol, he said.

“Ethanol is very environment-friendly fuel with zero-emission,” he said.

Previously there was only one rate of ethanol but the government has fixed different price for different sources of ethanol.

At present ethanol production is allowed from C-heavy molasses, B-heavy molasses, sugarcane juice or syrup or direct sugar. The ethanol procurement season by oil marketing companies (OMCs) will run from December 1, 2020, to November 30, 2021.

For the 2019-20 season that will end next month, sugar mills have so far offered around 195 crore litres of ethanol of which 142 crore litres (around 73%) has already been supplied to oil marketing companies (OMCs).

The blending ratio is half of the 10% mandated by the government.

For 2020-21, OMCs have projected a requirement of 465 crore litres of ethanol for meeting the 10% blending target.

Sugar mills have an installed ethanol production capacity of around 3.55 billion litres which is expected to rise to around 4.66 billion litres in the next few years, thus enabling the mills to produce more ethanol.

“All distilleries will be able to take benefit of the scheme and a large number of them are expected to supply ethanol for the programme. Remunerative price to ethanol suppliers will help in the reduction of cane farmer’s arrears, in the process contributing to minimizing the difficulty of sugarcane farmers,” an official statement issued on the CCEA decision said.

The government has been implementing Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme wherein OMCs sell petrol blended with ethanol up to 10%. This programme has been extended to the whole of India except Union Territories of Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands with effect from April 1, 2019, to promote the use of alternative and environment-friendly fuels.

Government has notified administered price of ethanol since 2014. For the first time during 2018, the differential price of ethanol-based on raw material utilized for ethanol production was announced by the government.

“With a view to providing long term perspective to the stakeholders, the Petroleum Ministry has published ‘Ethanol Procurement Policy on a long-term basis under EBP Programme’ In line with this, OMCs have already completed the one-time registration of ethanol suppliers.

“OMCs have further reduced the security deposit amount from 5% to 1% extending a benefit of around ₹400 crore to ethanol suppliers,” the statement said.

They have also reduced the applicable penalty on non-supplied quantity from earlier 5% to 1% extending a benefit of around ₹35 crore to suppliers.

“Consistent surplus of sugar production is depressing sugar price. Consequently, sugarcane farmer’s dues have increased due to the lower capability of the sugar industry to pay the farmers. Government has taken many decisions for reduction of cane farmer’s dues,” it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hx1km7/article29323369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THSUGARCANE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/govt-hikes-ethanol-price-by-up-to-rs-334ltr/article32973763.ece
378,2020/10/29,Shapoorji Pallonji Group submits plan to SC for separation from Tatas,"The Mistrys have valued their holding in the Tatas at ₹1.75 lakh crore.

The Shapoorji Pallonji Group on Thursday said it has submitted a plan to Supreme Court to end its seven decades-old association with the Tata Group.

The Mistrys have valued their holding in the Tatas at ₹1.75 lakh crore, it informed the Supreme Court, which is hearing the long-drawn legal battle between the two groups that began after the Tatas in a boardroom coup on October 28, 2016 sacked Cyrus Mistry as the Chairman.

“Tata Sons is effectively a two-group company, with the Tata Group comprising Tata Trusts, Tata family members and Tata companies holding 81.6% of the equity share capital, and the Mistry family owning the balance 18.37%,” the Shapoorji Pallonji Group said in a statement quoting from its submission to the Supreme Court.

The group has submitted a plan for separation from Tatas to the Supreme Court.

Tata Sons is the core investment company and is the holding company for the Tata Group and its value arises from its stake in listed equities, non-listed equities, the brand, cash balances and immovable assets. The value of 18.37% stake of the SP Group in Tata Sons is over ₹1,75,000 crore, it said.

In their scheme of separation, the SP Group said disputes over valuation can be eliminated by doing a pro-rata split of listed assets (share price value is known) and pro-rata share of the brand (brand valuation already done by Tata and published). A neutral third-party valuation can be done for the unlisted assets adjusted for net debt.

As a non-cash settlement, the SP Group sought pro-rata shares in listed Tata entities where Tata Sons currently owns stake.

For example, while Tatas own 72% of TCS, the SP Group’s ownership of 18.37% in Tata Sons translates to 13.22% shareholding of TCS, which is worth ₹1,35,000 crore at present market capitalisation, as per the statement.

Pro-rata share of brand value adjusted for net debt can be settled in cash and/ or in listed securities, the statement said.

For the unlisted companies, an expedited valuation can be done with a valuer selected by both sides. This can be settled in cash and/or in listed securities, it added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/foo9in/article30468047.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THNCLAT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/shapoorji-pallonji-group-submits-plan-to-supreme-court-for-separation-from-tatas/article32973147.ece
379,2020/10/29,Lowest core sector shrinking since March,"The decline in output during the month under review was lowest since March.

India’s eight core industry sectors shrank just 0.8% in September on a year-on-year basis, recording their lowest contraction since March 2020, with electricity and steel output clocking positive growth for the first time since March, and coal production rising for the second month in a row.

Cement output improved in September, recording a 3.5% year-on-year drop — the lowest since March when production had collapsed 25.1%. Surprisingly, fertiliser production which had grown consistently from May to August, marginally contracted in September by 0.3%.

The Office of the Economic Adviser in the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, which compiles the Index of Eight Core Industries, also revised its earlier estimates for June and August.

“The final growth rate of Index of Eight Core Industries for June 2020 is revised to (-) 12.4 %,” said an official statement released on Thursday. Earlier, output was estimated to have declined by 15% in June. Similarly, August had recorded a 8.5% dip in the index as per earlier estimates, which has now been moderated to a 7.3% decline.

Consequently, output contraction from the core sectors, which account for little over 40% of the Index of Industrial Production, stood at 14.9% in the first half of 2020-21, recovering slightly from the 17.8% decline recorded by August.

“While many lead indicators have displayed signals of a strengthening economic recovery in September 2020, we caution that the sustainability of the upturn may not be universal, and await signs of its durability,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA Ratings.

September’s improvement in core sector numbers is also attributable to the effect of a lower base, as the index had recorded negative growth of 5.1% in September 2019, with coal, steel and electricity clocking output contractions.

Coal output which had shrunk in September 2019 by 20.9%, has reported 21.2% growth in September 2020. Steel production grew by 0.9% in September 2020, compared to a 1.4% contraction a year ago. Electricity output similarly grew 3.7%, vis-a-vis a 2.6% decline recorded in September 2019.

Production of natural gas (-10.6%), crude oil (-6%) and refinery products (-9.5%) continued to fall in September, indicating these sectors are yet to recover from the demand shock that followed the national lockdown imposed in late March.

Natural gas output fell for the sixteenth month in a row, crude oil fell for the 34th successive month and refinery products recorded their seventh month of contraction, as per a CARE Ratings note on Thursday’s data.

“The sharp improvement in the core sector output is encouraging and collates well with the higher consumer spending seen in early October. A low base effect in the next month and the further unlocking of the economy is likely to push this growth into positive territory in the next month. The negative growth in the oil segment will further narrow in the coming months as the unlock process becomes more prevalent in the country,” the firm noted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/dsdla2/article32972999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KOCHIREFINERY,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/eight-core-industries-output-contracts-08-in-september/article32973000.ece
380,2020/10/29,RBI imposes ₹22 lakh fine on DCB Bank for violating marketing norms,"The Reserve Bank imposed the penalty by an order dated October 28, DCB Bank said in a BSE filing

Private sector lender DCB Bank on Thursday said RBI has imposed a fine of ₹22 lakh on the bank for violating marketing norms for financial products.

The Reserve Bank imposed the penalty by an order dated October 28, DCB Bank said in a BSE filing.

“The RBI has...imposed a monetary penalty of ₹22 lakh on DCB Bank for non-compliance with certain provisions of directions issued by RBI contained in the circular on ‘Marketing/distribution of mutual fund/insurance etc., products by banks’ dated November 16, 2009,” the RBI order attached with the filing said.

The central bank said the penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers vested in RBI under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

“This action is based on the deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers,” RBI said.

RBI had conducted an off-site examination of the records related to para-banking activity in a matter of default on the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL).

The off-site examination and the related correspondence revealed non-compliance with the relevant directions issued by RBI. Thus, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for non-compliance with the directions, the RBI order said.

“After considering the bank’s reply to the notice, oral submissions made in the personal hearing and examination of additional submissions, RBI concluded that the aforesaid charges of non-compliance with RBI directions were substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty,” it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/5jayek/article32932910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THBURBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/rbi-imposes-22-lakh-fine-on-dcb-bank-for-violating-marketing-norms/article32972487.ece

382,2020/10/29,Dr.Reddy’s to get BIRAC support for Sputnik V vaccine clinical trials,"Govt. committed to fast track clinical development of COVID vaccine candidates, says DBT Secratary Renu Swarup.

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories has announced a collaboration with Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) to receive advisory support for the clinical trials of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine that the company plans to start soon in the country.

Under the partnership, it will get to identify and use some of BIRAC’s clinical trial centres for the vaccine, which are funded under the National Biopharma Mission, implemented by Project Management Unit-NBM at BIRAC.

Further, it will have access to Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP) labs to conduct immunogenicity assay testing of the vaccine, the pharma major said in a statement on Thursday.

An industry-academia interface, BIRAC was set up by the Central government’s Department of Biotechnology.

DBT Secretary and BIRAC Chairperson Renu Swarup said the government is committed to fast track clinical development of COVID vaccine candidates and provide facilitation to accelerate market readiness of a suitable vaccine.

“We at DBT look forward to this partnership with Dr. Reddy’s for this Indo-Russian collaboration for vaccine development,"" she said.

Dr. Reddy’s Chairman Satish Reddy said the company looked forward to working with BIRAC to “accelerate our efforts in bringing the vaccine to India.”

The company and Russia’s sovereign wealth fund RDIF, which is supporting development of the vaccine by the Moscow-based Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, had in September announced a collaboration for clinical trials and distribution of the vaccine in India.

Sputnik V vaccine, registered by the Ministry of Health of Russia in August, is the world’s first registered vaccine against COVID-19 based on the human adenoviral vector platform.

Earlier this month, Dr. Reddy’s and RDIF had received approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to conduct an adaptive phase 2/3 human clinical trial for the vaccine. The Hyderabad-headquartered company’s CEO Erez Israeli, during a media interaction on Wednesday, had said the phase II trials were expected to begin soon. It will have about 100 participants soon and get over by December, while the Phase III trials, with 1,500 participants, could be completed as early as March.

Since the completion is subject to compilation of data and regulatory approvals, it could stretch into April or May, he had said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/kqgrut/article32408271.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th20-suhasini-NGTR7MLUBR3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/drreddys-to-get-birac-support-for-sputnik-v-vaccine-clinical-trials/article32971619.ece

The construction division of Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) has secured a ‘Mega’ order of unspecified amount for its Heavy Civil Infrastructure business in India from the National High-Speed Rail Corporation Ltd. (NHRCL), executing the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail Project.

A mega order is worth over ₹7,000 crore as per the company’s set parameters.

“This is the biggest EPC contract awarded in the country to date and is the first of its kind project with a mandate to construct the 237.1 km stretch MAHSR-C4 package which is part of the project,” L&T said in a statement.

“This is by far the largest EPC order that L&T has won in its history and to execute such a huge and complex infrastructure project, we will deploy state-of-the-art construction methods and extensive digital technologies,” said S.V. Desai, Whole Time Director & Senior Executive Vice-President (Civil Infrastructure).

The scope for the MAHSR-C4 package includes the construction of viaducts, stations, major river bridges, depots, and other auxiliary works.

The approximately 508 km Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project, also called the MAHSR Bullet Train project, will cover 155.76 km in Maharashtra, 4.3 km in the Union Territory of Dadra & Nagar Haveli and 348.04 km in Gujarat with 12 stations along the route.

Upon completion, the high-speed rail will operate at a speed of 320 kmph, covering the entire distance in approximately two hours with limited stops and in three hours with all stops.

S.N. Subrahmanyan, CEO & MD, L&T, said “At a time of grave uncertainty during the time of the pandemic, the award of such a huge infrastructure order augurs very well not just for the construction industry but for the entire infrastructure sector as well.”

‘Bold decision’

“It is a major and very bold decision by the government of India, Ministry of Railways, Indian Railway Board and NHRCL. We believe it will be an inflection point in the resurrection of India’s infrastructure economy by not only creating jobs but also encouraging several other industries, MSMEs, SMEs to be a part of this mega project to provide the necessary services and facilities under the Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan,” he said.

“It is certainly a testimony to the capabilities of Larsen and Toubro to build such mega infrastructure projects. Once again, L&T is proud to be associated with a project of significant national importance with yet another opportunity to live up to being builders to the nation,” he added.

384,2020/10/29,COVID-19 hits India’s gold-buying sentiment; Q3 demand drops by 30%: WGC,"The overall demand stood at 123.9 tonnes during the third quarter of 2019, according to WGC’s Q3 Gold Demand Trends report

Gold demand in India dropped by 30 % during the July-September quarter to 86.6 tonnes compared to the same period last year due to COVID-19 related disruptions and ruling high prices, World Gold Council (WGC) said in a report.

The overall demand stood at 123.9 tonnes during the third quarter of 2019, according to WGC’s Q3 Gold Demand Trends report.

In terms of value, gold demand declined by 4 % during the quarter under review at ₹39, 510 crore compared to ₹41,300 crore in the same quarter of 2019.

India’s Q3 2020 gold demand fell by 30 % to 86.6 tonnes on the back of COVID-19 related disruptions, bleak consumer sentiment and high prices accompanied by volatility, WGC Managing Director, India, Somasundaram P.R. told PTI.

This is, however, higher than Q2, which at 64 tonnes was a 70 % drop and the second lowest in our quarterly series. This has been partially due to easing of lockdown and some low prices in August that provided a small window of buying opportunities for the discerning, Somasundaram said.

Meanwhile, the total jewellery demand in India decreased by 48 % to 52.8 tonnes compared to 101.6 tonnes in the same quarter last year.

Similarly, in terms of value, jewellery demand fell 29 % to ₹24,100 crore from ₹33,850 crore in July-September 2019.

However, total investment demand during the third quarter surged by 52 % to 33.8 tonnes compared to 22.3 tonnes in the same period of 2019.

Similarly, in value terms, gold Investment demand was ₹15,410 crore, up by 107 % from ₹7,450 crore in the corresponding period of 2019.

The third quarter tends to be relatively low generally due to seasonal factors like monsoons and inauspicious periods like Pitru-Paksh and Adhik Maas. Jewellery demand fell by 48 % as jewellery purchases did not have any support of festivals or weddings, Somasundaram added.

Moreover, he pointed out that buying jewellery in the country is an experience and the restrictions including social distancing, wearing masks have kept consumer footfalls to the retail stores low.

On the other hand, he said gold’s safe haven attributes and an anticipation of price rise paved the way for an increase in investment demand for gold bars and coins by 51 % to 33.8 tonnes, he said.

One interesting development during these months of lockdown has been the rapid rise in digital engagement with several tech initiatives by top jewellers to woo buyers. Digital platforms selling allocated gold through wallets also recorded sharp rise in volumes, along with significant activity in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) following a prolonged period of quiescence, he pointed out.

Total gold recycled in India in the third quarter was 41.5 tonnes, up by 14 % compared to 36.5 tonnes in the same quarter of 2019.

Due to higher prices, recycling increased by 14 % to 41.5 tonnes, though inventory rationalisation by jewellers and steep discounts in the market did impact full price recovery for sellers, he observed.

Meanwhile, he said, imports resumed in anticipation of festival demand as supply chain-related restrictions were eased, growing from 9 tonnes in the previous quarter to 90.5 tonnes.

“Looking ahead, we typically witness an upswing in gold demand in the fourth quarter on account of Dussehra, Dhanteras and other festivals coupled with a busy wedding season post-harvest.

“This year, a good monsoon notwithstanding, price and COVID-19 shadow will affect sentiment, though we can reasonably expect at least a part of the pent-up demand to surface,” Mr. Somasundaram said.

“As weddings and festivities become low-key affairs, savings on other spends could be channelised into gold,” he added.

“A sense of cautious optimism has returned among the trade stemming from the fact that the society is gradually learning to live with COVID-19.

“However as we are still reeling under the impact of the pandemic and fear of second wave of infections without clear sight of many variables on consumer behaviour, volatile prices or length of the disruptions, we will not be able to quantify the impact on the full year gold demand in India other than to say that demand could be multi-year low.

“But, post COVID-19 demand is likely to surge like post-2009, when demand was 642 tonnes and rose sharply to 1,002 tonne in 2010 and continued to be high in 2011 and 2012,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/xzsfbv/article32584687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THBULOCK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/covid-19-hits-indias-gold-buying-sentiment-q3-demand-drops-by-30-wgc/article32970649.ece

Awfis, a homegrown coworking service provider, has entered the Chennai market and has set up its first space, spread over 65,000 sq. ft at Gemini Circle, Nungambakkam. This centre has 1,200 seats.

“Chennai is an untapped market with great underlying potential for the flexible workspace sector. With industries opening up to the flexible/shared workspace concept, we are confident that this trend will continue to grow,” said Amit Ramani, CEO and Founder, Awfis.

He added, “Due to pandemic-induced restrictions, even the most traditional companies will see merit in setting up satellite offices outside metros, with offices spread across multiple locations to help people work near home or to enable distributed workspace model.” Mr. Ramani also pointed out that with good connectivity to metro trains, Chennai as a market had tremendous potential in the coworking space.

Over the next 12-18 months, the firm intended to scale up to 5-6 centres in Chennai. “By March 2021, we will add the next three centres,” Mr. Ramani said and added that the firm was looking at places, including Anna Salai, T. Nagar and Guindy. Plans were on cards to enter tier-2 towns in Tamil Nadu. Awfis currently had 67 operational coworking centres with 35,000+ seating capacity. It had 10 centres in Bengaluru, eight in Hyderabad, along with multiple centres in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, among other prominent cities across India.

386,2020/10/29,Samsung Electronics sees profit decline on weak server chip demand after strong Q3 earnings,"Samsung posts highest quarterly profit in 2 years.

Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Thursday it expects fourth-quarter profit to fall due to weak server chip demand and rising smartphone competition, after posting its best quarterly operating profit in two years in the third quarter.

The world's top maker of smartphones and memory chips flagged a recovery in the mobile and chip markets next year although it was wary of disruption from the coronavirus pandemic and U.S.-China trade tensions in the short-term.

“Global demand is forecast to increase year on year, but uncertainties are unlikely to ease given the possibility of additional waves of the pandemic,” Ben Suh, Samsung's executive vice president of investor relations, said in an earnings call.

Samsung said mobile chip demand would rise in the fourth quarter, as Chinese customers boost orders following U.S. restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, but server chip demand would remain weak due to large customer inventories.

“After the U.S. restrictions against Huawei took effect in earnest, demand from Chinese customers has increased,” said Han Jin-man, senior vice president of memory chip business.

Highest quarterly smartphone profit since 2014

China mobile chip demand up since U.S. restrictions on Huawei

Samsung expects Q4 profits to fall on-quarter

Samsung has applied for its U.S. license to export chips to Huawei and still waiting for the result, Han said.

Operating profit in the July-September period jumped 59% to 12.35 trillion won ($11 billion) on the back of Samsung's highest quarterly smartphone profit since 2014 at 4.45 trillion won ($4 billion).

Huawei

In the third quarter, a near 50% surge in smartphone sales likely reflected gains in Samsung's share of the market as rival Huawei lost market share due to the U.S. restrictions, while lower marketing costs amid the pandemic were also a factor, analysts said.

Samsung said its chip profit leapt 82% to 5.54 trillion won from a year earlier, as higher sales of low- and mid-end smartphones and inventory buildup from Huawei ahead of the U.S. restrictions offset weak demand from servers.

Samsung's smartphone shipments in the current quarter are expected to drop about 5% compared to the previous period due to competition from Apple's newest iPhone 12 and a lack of new Samsung flagship models, analysts said.

“With Huawei's presence becoming fainter in the smartphone market, Samsung's marketing costs are expected to be higher in the current quarter as Apple, Vivo, Xiaomi and Samsung try to take over Huawei's market share,” said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities.

Samsung's display earnings, which reported weaker third quarter operating profit as major customer Apple Inc delayed launching its new model, would benefit from robust demand for Apple's first 5G iPhones in the fourth quarter, he added.

Its foundry business reported a new high for quarterly sales on recovered mobile demand, while its logic chip business said it plans to achieve double-digit sales growth next year.

Samsung's home appliance and TV business posted record earnings in third quarter, driven by “stay-at-home” trends and governments' expansionary policies such as unemployment benefits.

Revenue climbed 8% to 66.96 trillion won. Net profit rose 49% to 9.36 trillion won.

394,2020/10/29,Victim’s account may be more conclusive than medical finding,"Courts should find no difficulty to convict the accused solely on the survivor's word

The alleged gang rape of a woman in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, in September brought forth an important issue concerning the relevance of forensic evidence of the victim of rape, i.e., about the signs of recent sexual intercourse and struggle. This acquired more attention after a senior police officer of U.P. stated that the forensic science laboratory report did not confirm the allegation of rape. Since the Hathras case is still under investigation, instead of commenting on it, I will explain the general medico-legal status and the various judgments of the Supreme Court in this regard.

It is surprising that doctors conducting medical examinations on victims still use the word ‘rape’ in their conclusions. They forget that rape is an offence and not a medical diagnosis to be made by them. The issue of whether someone has been raped or not is a legal conclusion; it is to be made by an investigating officer on a complaint by the victim. The medical officer can only state whether there is evidence of recent sexual activity and injuries in and around the private parts of the victim or bite marks noticed in any part of the body.

Collecting evidence

The presence of semen is always a material piece of evidence, but by no means conclusive. Semen, a human body fluid, is a suspension of a single type of cell known as spermatozoa. The nucleus of the sperm head contains deoxyribonucleoproteins which is used to establish the identity of the accused. The spermatozoa can be identified only for 72 hours after sexual assault and the likelihood of its presence after that is greatly reduced. Therefore, it is generally advisable to collect evidence up to 96 hours in case the victim is unsure of the number of hours that have elapsed since the assault. However, in such cases, swabs can still be collected for identifying semen. Evidence on the outside of the body and on material such as clothing can be collected even after 96 hours.

The courts have carefully examined the value of victim statements qua forensic evidence. In Tuka Ram v. State of Maharashtra (1978), also known as the ‘Mathura case’, the accused policemen were acquitted as the victim bore no traces of violence. But in later cases, absence of live or dead spermatozoa during vaginal examination was held to be irrelevant by the Supreme Court. It is established now that injury is not a sine qua non for deciding whether rape has been committed. In State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh (1996), the court laid down that the victim’s ipse dixit is sufficient to record a conviction and no corroboration is necessary.

Hathras gang rape | Autopsy shows strangulation, fracture

Change in rape law

There was no change in the rape law from 1860 to 1983. The first major change came about after the apex court decision in the ‘Mathura case’ and the burden of proof was shifted to the accused. The Criminal Procedure Code was amended to incorporate medical examination of the victim within 24 hours of receiving information relating to commission of rape. The definition of rape was enlarged after the ‘Nirbhaya’ case in 2012. The expression ‘sexual intercourse’ has been removed from the definition for a shift in emphasis that it is not necessarily a union of sexual organs that could give rise to proof of rape. There is no need to find out whether or not the woman is habituated to sex. It is irrelevant and inappropriate to record such findings.

It is well settled that the testimony of a victim in sexual assault cases is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate corroboration, the courts should find no difficulty to convict the accused solely on the testimony of the victim. If the evidence is reliable, conviction can be based on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix. The forensic evidence is at the most corroborative evidence; not conclusive. Moreover, the forensic details need not be disclosed to the public when the matter is still under investigation. It may hurt the victim’s fundamental right to privacy.

395,2020/10/29,Bihar’s circulation of elites,"Marginalised groups get token representation for electoral purposes and are largely excluded from the levers of power

Democracy is meant to promote civic consciousness. Therefore, it should abolish all kinds of irrational identities including caste. Yet, electoral democracy in most parts of India works through caste and representation. The khas (special) and the raees (wealthy) get the highest preference in the distribution of power, while smaller communities tend to receive token representation.

This phenomenon is particularly relevant in Bihar where the khas groups have acquired direct access to state institutions and utilise them to perpetuate the dominance of the elite. This does not mean that khas groups are exclusive. There is a circulation of elites in Bihar that allows for newer dominant groups to replace the previously dominant ones. This means that there is a narrow pyramid of political power that has different elite sections but does not accommodate other marginalised groups over time.

Full coverage | Bihar assembly elections

OBC mobilisation

Bihar comprises about 205 caste groups. Immediately post Independence, caste groups such as the Kayasthas, Brahmins, Bhumihars and Kshatriyas, which together constitute 20% of Bihar’s population, carved out a dominant space for themselves in politics and retained their hegemony for a few decades. Back in the colonial period, these groups had acquired sufficient education and jobs. They then led political communities in the State during the freedom movement. From 1952 onwards, for about three decades, they produced the largest number of MPs and MLAs under the aegis of the Congress. Numerically populous Other Backward Classes (OBC) groups such as the Yadavs, Kurmis and Koeries, besides Scheduled Castes (SC) such as the Chamars and Dusadhs, were allowed token representation. The OBC communities had also groomed aspirations for their share in state power during the colonial period — political organisations representing Yadav-Kurmi-Koeri interests were formed in the late 1930s.

Soon members of the OBCs also comprised raiyyat (wealthier) sections who had attained ownership of agricultural land after years of being tillers. The Green Revolution bestowed benefits on them and other governmental and banking schemes allowed them to become rural entrepreneurs. All this provided opportunities to them to avail of good education and government jobs and political power later on. These groups were initially mobilised around most non-Congress political outfits, the Socialist parties, as the Congress was predominantly hegemonised by the upper caste political elite. Later, the non-Congress outfits allowed for an OBC-elite dominated political forum which managed to supplant the upper caste-dominated political structure by getting accommodated into the structures of state power, beginning in the 1980s. Under this political regime of Yadav-Kurmi-Koeri-led political elites, however, only a few OBC groups got a political share. The rest, more than 90 OBC groups, are yet to be accommodated in structures of political power and lack the ability to take advantage of state patronage.

Contradictions within

Upper caste elites supporting the Congress gradually shifted to the BJP in the 1980s. This process quickened during the Ramjanmabhoomi movement. The OBC elites got divided between the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Janata Dal (United) by the 2000s — a process that occurred due to the competing aspirations of the Yadav-dominated OBC leadership on the one hand and the Kurmi-Koeris on the other. The internal contradictions among the OBCs and the consequent lowering of numerical superiority led to these parties providing for some representation for marginalised groups as well. Among the Dalits too, the numerically superior Chamars and Dusadhs managed to gain a share in state power over time and produced new political elites, while other Dalit communities did not gain a share. Essentially, distribution of various opportunities through government schemes and policies were still controlled by the dominant political elite.

As Bihar’s political leadership transits from its Mandal generation – with Lalu Prasad in jail, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar diminishing in popularity, and the death of Ram Vilas Paswan – to a new crop of leaders, there is the expectation that the dependence on identity politics will give way to a more inclusive politics that tries to mobilise people across different segments. Yet, if the emphasis remains on representation in power structures being limited to the elite among a select set of not more than 20 castes, there will not be any true change. The marginal communities which lack the capacity to aspire towards and engage in this system and those who have not yet had access to education and wealth will continue to be invisible.

396,2020/10/29,Helping dyslexic children bloom,"When inclusive teaching strategies become mainstream, each student in the class will flourish

Mumtaz does not like reading. At nine she can manage basic stories, but reading leaves her tired and irritable. Movies and television dramas fascinate her, but even the lure of a well-written story cannot coax her into reading. She does not do storytelling either. The story would unfold with the beginning, middle and end all jumbled up. Then there are the funny words: hopsital (for hospital), strachedy (for strategy). But she was a happy, chirpy kid, always the life of a party, loved by all.

Things began to change as she entered school. Her mother was the first to notice. For an otherwise multilingual chatterbox, she appeared to lack an intuitive understanding of phonics or basic arithmetic. Her vocabulary was lagging, her comprehension lacking. Her father could somehow relate to her better. A successful financial analyst, he still avoids books. He vividly remembers struggling through school, labelled ‘lazy’ by his teachers. His daughter perhaps took after him, but she will figure it out, just like he did. But six months of internal struggle and the undeniable social withdrawal of their bright and happy child drove them to finally approach a child psychologist. The psychologist conducted a cognitive assessment and finally delivered the verdict.

Struggling to keep it all together

Mumtaz has a specific learning disorder or SLD, in her case, dyslexia. This is a condition that makes it difficult to read and write, often accompanied by difficulties in math. Reading requires (1) decoding or converting symbols into sounds and (2) comprehension or understanding the meaning of words. Dyslexics may have difficulty in either or both. Dyslexics have poor phonological awareness, the ability to recognise similarities and differences in sounds, for example in rhyming words. They may have trouble sequencing; for instance remembering sequences such as days of the week, syllables in a word (hence hopsital), steps in a long division, or the order of events in a story. They may also have a weak working memory such as difficulty in listening to the teacher while taking notes or following their mother’s multi-step instructions. Working memory is like the RAM of a computer, where you temporarily store bits of information to be retrieved for daily activities. Children with dyslexia may look like they are not paying attention, but in reality they are struggling to keep it all together. Dyslexia is a very diverse condition: Mumtaz is one example while young Ishaan in the movie Taare Zameen Par is another, with different combinations of deficits.

For most of our existence we Homo sapiens have communicated verbally. When books were first written, only the scholars needed to read them. As modern societies began embracing universal school-based standardised education, instead of the usual apprenticeship for vocational training, we stumbled upon dyslexia.

Differences in the brain

Dyslexia often runs in the family. Comparisons of genomes of dyslexic people with proficient readers have found changes in many genes that could be associated with dyslexia. These studies are opening new windows into our understanding of how the brain learns. The brain is, however, too complex for us to yet be able to figure out whether these genes have any direct role in reading deficits. In humans, the area known as visual word form area (VWFA — that recognises written words) in the brain is connected to the language region even before children have learned to read. This must be one of those evolutionary inventions that set us up to be linguists and decoders meant for greater things. Comparisons of functional MRI (fMRI) scans of brains of skilled and dyslexic readers clearly show differences in regions related to reading and language processing. But they also show many other differences. Differences in our brain are what make us sociable, moody, imaginative or creative. Thus, these differences in the brains of dyslexics manifest in the way they look at the world, think about and solve problems. Dyslexic individuals are more likely to miss the details while being able to see the larger picture. They may have better pattern recognition and visual-spatial abilities even as they struggle with reading and sequencing. They may be better at dealing with social interactions and managing people. Perhaps these are the traits that helped Albert Einstein and Agatha Christie and Steve Jobs, all dyslexics, to make their mark in the world. But this blooming generally happens after they leave the trauma of school and discover their strengths for themselves.

Also read | Overcoming the challenge

Could we forgo this trauma and bolster their strengths in the school itself? Armed with the diagnosis, Mumtaz’s parents entered her into a remedial programme where special education teachers worked with her individually to strengthen her phonological awareness, sequencing and math skills. The school started providing accommodations in the class and gave her extra time and help in understanding the questions during tests. Slowly she began to regain her footing in the school. She is still way behind her classmates in academics, but with encouragement from teachers and parents she has discovered a talent for music and sports. She received this support and help thanks to her getting identified as a dyslexic. Every teacher will agree that there are always a few children in their class who have difficulties with language and math. But these deficits do not get formally identified due to a lack of awareness among teachers and parents. To add to this, privately administered cognitive assessments and remedial classes are very expensive and not within the reach of all.

Remedial measures

Some of these issues can be remedied by making cognitive assessments compulsory in junior school. The National Education Policy 2020 mandates inclusive education for all children with disabilities. It states that teachers should be provided with help to identify children with learning disabilities early, so that these children can be supported from the beginning. It lists out specific actions such as using appropriate technology, allowing students to work at their own pace and making curricula flexible to make education accessible to all. There is now a framework in place to implement such changes in our educational institutions. When inclusive teaching strategies become mainstream, then each student in the class will flourish. A child who believes in herself and feels confident to face her own personal challenges is a child set on a path to success and happiness.

397,2020/10/29,Two together: On India-U.S. ties and China,"While strengthening its U.S. ties, India must not let this interfere in the dispute with China

The India-U.S. Foreign and Defence Ministers meet for the “2+2” mechanism just a week before the U.S. elections is proof that bilateral ties between the two countries are on a firm footing. Ostensibly, the purpose was to conduct an annual review of ties and to wrap up the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) for Geo-spatial Cooperation, the last of the three enabling agreements which will facilitate easier interoperability between the Indian and American defence forces. Other agreements signed or reviewed included those in the areas of health and COVID-19 cooperation, building strategic petroleum reserves in the U.S., renewable energy, space, cyberspace, counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics. In the Joint statement they issued, the Ministers also called on Pakistan to take “immediate, sustained and irreversible action” against cross-border terror groups on its soil, and to bring to justice the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and 2016 Uri and Pathankot strikes. However, the timing and the tenor of the American pronouncements prior to the visit made it clear that the larger import of the visit for the Trump administration was about dealing with China. In every interaction, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to the challenge from Beijing, of the need to build a counter coalition to the “Chinese Communist Party”, and to further U.S. Indo-Pacific policy in this regard. In India, he made a reference to the “increasing aggression and destabilising activities by China” and mentioned Indian soldiers killed in clashes with the PLA on the LAC in June. He is taking the same message to his next stops. In Colombo and Male on Wednesday — he is also visiting Indonesia — Mr. Pompeo raised the need to counter and provide alternatives to what he called China’s “bad deals, violations of sovereignty and lawlessness on land and sea”.

For New Delhi, the visit by the U.S. officials was a way to demonstrate that the bilateral relationship is “poll-proof” and will grow regardless of the November 3 election result. The BECA agreement signed is an important addition to India’s defence and strategic capabilities, and it is significant that India-U.S. ties have been reaffirmed now given that it could take some months for the U.S. administration to restart bilateral engagements post-elections. While welcoming their U.S. interlocutors and taking ties forward, however, it is significant that the government has chosen not to enter into the comments made by Mr. Pompeo on India’s China challenge, in keeping with New Delhi’s stated policy that the LAC tensions are a “bilateral matter”. The conspicuous silence from External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in response to Mr. Pompeo’s comments on China is also a sobering reminder that while India appreciates support from the U.S., it retains its strategic autonomy in dealing with threats and troubles with its biggest neighbour.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/two-together-the-hindu-editorial-on-india-us-ties-and-china/article32966548.ece
398,2020/10/29,Real estate: On changes to J&K land laws,"People’s participation in the political process is a must for J&K to see stability with growth

The changes in land laws in Jammu and Kashmir notified by the Centre on October 26 allow the purchase of land by those who are not permanent residents of the Union Territory, for the first time. Only permanent residents could purchase land in the erstwhile State, which was reorganised as two UTs, J&K and Ladakh, in August 2019. One of the arguments against the now nullified special status of J&K was that the restrictions on land transfers hampered investments. J&K industrial policy had limited land holding of investors to designated enclaves. The changes in land laws were logical steps to follow the end of the special status. Some restrictions remain on the transfer of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes, but this too can be cleared by the district collector. The government has said the changes will encourage investment and advance peace and progress in J&K. The argument that these changes would help the people of the region might have been stronger if these were done in consultation with them. The irony is that in all three regions — Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh — there is strong opposition to opening the land market to non-residents. Political parties in J&K too have opposed the changes.

Free movement of people, and an integrated national market can advance development but India’s governance structure accommodates fears and concerns of local populations in this context in a measured manner. There are several States which have provisions to regulate ownership and transfer of land under Article 371 of the Constitution. The Centre is expected to announce new land laws for the UT of Ladakh before October 30, and it has promised to “safeguard interests of the people” regarding “all issues related to language, demography, ethnicity, land and jobs”. The Centre’s approach towards J&K has been marked by a lack of trust, which has accentuated the alienation of large sections of the population. Fears of deliberate demographic engineering have dominated politics in the Valley for long. After the reorganisation of the State and the loss of its special status in 2019, the people of Jammu and Ladakh also turned nervous on this question. Desirable as it may be, there is no point forcing a particular path of development upon people. The situation is precarious also because of the heavy hand of the state on political and civil society activities in J&K. The unilateralism that has come to define New Delhi’s dealings with J&K is achieving little. There is no wisdom in pushing through measures aimed to promote investment when the end result is political volatility. The Centre’s policy towards J&K must be buttressed by a robust political process that enables people’s participation and ensures stability with growth and development.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/real-estate-the-hindu-editorial-on-changes-to-jk-land-laws/article32966563.ece

402,2020/10/29,62 persons had COVID-related stroke in Bengaluru from June to August,"Study shows that 16% of them died in hospital

As many as 62 people diagnosed with COVID-19 suffered a stroke in the city during the infection between June and August. Of these 16% died in hospital, a study by doctors from St John’s Medical College Hospital has revealed.

The multi-centre retrospective study from 13 hospitals has been accepted for publication in the International Journal of Stroke, the official publication of the World Stroke Organization.

A stroke is the sudden onset of neurological deficit due to vascular causes.

Thomas Mathew, Professor and Head of the department of Neurology at St. John’s Medical College Hospital, who is the principal investigator of the study, told The Hindu that COVID-19 related strokes (CORS) are associated with increased mortality and morbidity.

“We found that mortality among the 62 CORS was high compared to the non-COVID-19 strokes diagnosed during the corresponding period last year. While 111 suffered a stroke from June to August last year according to St. John’s Stroke Registry, no death was reported,” he said.

Of the 62 CORS, 60 (97%) patients had ischemic strokes while two (3%) had haemorrhagic strokes. A majority of them (59.7%) had a “bad” stroke wherein the large artery was blocked.

The mean age of patients was 55.66 with a standard deviation of 13.20 years. While 34 (77.4%) were male patients, 26 % (16/62) of patients did not have any conventional risk factors for stroke.

Risk factors

Attributing CORS in those without risk factors to inflammation triggered thrombosis and damage to endothelium due to COVID-19, Dr. Mathew said: “However, in the remaining 46 patients, 54.8% had diabetes, 61.3% had hypertension, 8% had coronary artery disease, and 4.8% had atrial fibrillation.”

Manifestations

City-based neurologists said they were seeing various neurological manifestations of COVID-19.

Amit Kulkarni, consultant neurologist at SPASRH Hospital, said with COVID-19 the problem was not just the sequelae of lung involvement but also varied other aspects like clotting occurring in the arteries of the lung, arteries of the brain, veins in the leg and venous sinuses in the brain, causing deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, arterial and venous strokes in the brain.

“What is also unusual about this disease is the varied immunological manifestations like limp paralysis of arms and legs (Guillian Barre syndrome), facial paralysis with asymmetry, cranial nerve palsies causing double vision, drooping of the eye and muscle involvement (myositis). We have noted quite a few peripheral nerve palsies presenting with foot drop in patients recently affected or recovering from COVID (inability to extend the foot) where the other routine blood work is negative for any connective tissue disease and there is no spinal/peripheral cause of nerve compression,” he said.

G.T. Subhas, former president of Bangalore Stroke Support Group and former director of Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute said the common symptoms of stroke can be remembered by Facial Drooping, Arm Weakness, Speech Difficulties and Time to reach a stroke ready hospital abbreviated as FAST.

Do not ignore

“Both during and post COVID-19, people should not ignore warning signs such as dizziness, sudden weakness in limbs and difficulty in speaking or understanding words. “Patients should reach the hospital within three or four hours of the stroke. The earlier the patient is rushed to a hospital, the better the outcome,” he added.

404,2020/10/29,ASER report underlines digital divide in Karnataka schools,"63% of students enrolled in government schools in rural Karnataka have access to smartphones against 82% in private schools

Online learning, which has become the norm due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has brought to the fore the digital divide in education with only children having access to smartphones and internet experiencing the benefits. The extent of the divide is stark, according to the Annual Status of Education Report (Rural) 2020 Wave 1 Report, which was released on Wednesday.

Only 63% of students aged between 5 and 18 years, enrolled in government schools in rural Karnataka, have access to smartphones. Among those enrolled in private schools, 82% had access to smartphones.

This year, the report examined the apparent effects of the pandemic on schooling and learning opportunities of children in rural India. For Karnataka, 3,128 households in 900 villages across all 30 districts were surveyed. A total of 7,557 children in the 5-18 years age group were surveyed.

The survey revealed that 89% of children enrolled in private schools and 80% of students enrolled in government schools have access to television.

Rise in enrolment

The report explored provision of and access to remote education mechanisms and materials in rural parts of the country, and how children, families, and educators were engaging with these from their homes. It noted an increase in enrolment in government schools: 71.86% of boys and 75.1% of girls have been enrolled in government schools this year, as against 66.2% boys and 74.2% girls in 2018.

It highlighted the role of government school teachers in ensuring that students were not left behind. Around 61% of government school teachers visited students or spoke to them or their parents in the reference week, which is the week before the survey was conducted.

The percentage of private school teachers who took similar initiatives stood at 55.6.

As far as availability of textbooks for their current grade was concerned, 93.9% of children in government schools had textbooks whereas only 76% of children in private schools had textbooks. However, only 73% of children in government schools and 67% of children in private schools received the learning material and activities in the reference week. The data applies only to rural schools.

The rise of WhatsApp

According to the survey, WhatsApp was the most used medium to share learning/activity material in private schools (76.2%) and government schools (40.3%).

“As schools are closed, children rely mainly on the resources available at home to help them learn. These resources can consist of people who can help them to study (for example, educated parents); technology (TV, radio or smartphone); or material (such as textbooks for the current grade),” a release by ASER said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/nw1592/article32966564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGASERP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/aser-report-underlines-digital-divide-in-karnataka-schools/article32966484.ece
405,2020/10/29,"To make them acceptable, waste processing plants to get mentors","Experts from the Technical Guidance Committee will be assigned to ensure scientific disposal of waste

Residents living around waste processing plants have often highlighted the mismanagement in the plants that is inconveniencing them day in and day out. Towards ensuring that the communities don’t suffer more, each processing plant will be ‘mentored’ by experts from the Technical Guidance Committee (TGC).

This development comes after communities living around the waste processing plant in Chikkanagamangala, near Electronics City, wrote to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Administrator Gaurav Gupta about the problems they were facing due to mismanagement.

The BBMP has proposed to establish a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant at the site.

Mr. Gupta told The Hindu that BBMP officials had visited the Chikkanagamangala plant to meet the staff, following which the issues were discussed with members of the TGC as well.

“We discussed the problems faced by communities living around the plants in detail, and some solutions were recommended. We have decided to assign one TGC member to each of the processing plants for mentorship,” he said.

He said that a technical team would be present in each plant to ensure scientific disposal of waste and also hear complaints from communities living near the plant.

“By adopting better techniques, we hope the nuisance that is being experienced by the communities will be reduced significantly,” Mr. Gupta said and added that the process is being closely monitored by the Karnataka High Court and actions have been taken as per the court’s directions.

Admitting that reports of most commissions on the functioning of waste processing plants point to mismanagement, as is being alleged by various communities, he said that with mentorship and technical leadership, such issues may see some resolution. He added that leadership was essential from people who are qualified and experienced.

“This way, there will not just be proper supervision, but they will also be able to extract the right work,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/aaf8ut/article32988465.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGBBMPP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/waste-processing-plants-to-get-mentors/article32966164.ece
406,2020/10/29,Bail for IMA founder in money laundering case,"High Court kept in mind his heart ailments, and his return from abroad and voluntary surrender

The Karnataka High Court has granted bail to Mohammed Mansoor Khan, managing director and chief executive officer of I Monetary Advisory (IMA) Group of companies, who is the prime accused in the money laundering case involving over ₹4,000 crore, which was registered against him by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

Justice Sreenivas Harish Kumar granted bail by imposing the condition that Khan should not alienate any of his properties till conclusion of the trial, and in case a need arises to alienate, he should disclose to the trial court the purpose which necessitates alienation and obtain permission of the trial court.

The High Court considered two main reasons, his ailments related to the heart, and his return from abroad and voluntary surrender before the police along with the passport, for granting bail.

As it was apprehended on behalf of the ED that he may attempt to alienate properties if he was enlarged on bail, the court said that necessary conditions can be imposed to prevent such an attempt.

Khan has been in judicial custody since August 2019.

While asking him to furnish a bond for ₹5 lakh and two sureties of like sum, the court directed the trial court to ascertain the whereabouts of the sureties before accepting the surety bonds.

As the ED has already filed a charge sheet against him, the High Court directed Khan to regularly appear before the sessions court for the purpose of the trial besides asking him to mark his attendance in the office of the ED once a month.

While Mansoor Khan has been granted bail in the ED case, he is being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and remains in judicial custody.

The CBI has registered four cases in connection with the IMA scam. “Our investigation is in progress. At this juncture, there is no scope for bail, and if he applies for bail, we will file objections,” a senior CBI officer said.

Early in October, the CBI filed a supplementary charge sheet against 28 accused, including the managing director and CEO of IMA. Six police officers, who are under investigation by the SIT for their alleged involvement in the scam, have been named in the CBI’s supplementary charge sheet.

Three police officers were suspended by the government based on the report filed by the CBI while it is yet to take action against two IPS officers named in the supplementary charge sheet.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bzkz2y/article32965955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGMANSOORKHANIMAP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bail-for-ima-founder-in-money-laundering-case/article32965956.ece
407,2020/10/29,"One dead, three injured in explosion in restaurant","Initial investigations point to overheating of a steamer in the kitchen

A 20-year-old youth was killed and three others were injured when a food steamer in a hotel at Richmond Circle exploded on Wednesday night. “The explosion took place around 8 p.m. in the kitchen while the victims – all employees – were working,” said a police officer.

“Initial investigations point to overheating of the steamer at New Udupi Upahar, but we are yet to ascertain the exact cause,” said the police.

Tension gripped the area for some time after passers-by heard the explosion. The few patrons, who were in the restaurant, fled when the hotel reverberated with the blast.

Fire and emergency service personnel extinguished the fire before it could spread. Teams, with the assistance of volunteers, rescued the injured employees who were rushed to a hospital nearby.

One of the employees, Manu, who hails from Assam, succumbed to his injuries and was declared as brought dead. He had been hired three months ago to help in the kitchen.

“Three other employees – Pradeep, Mohan and Naveen – have sustained severe burn injuries,” said a police officer. The Ashok Nagar police are trying to ascertain the exact cause of the mishap.

408,2020/10/29,Sports academies resume play,"But the turnout remains low, and some are struggling with rent and other expenses

Sports activities, both professional and recreational, came to a halt during the lockdown to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. This unforeseen crisis affected the finances of the several sports academies in the city.

However, with the easing of restrictions, a semblance of normalcy has returned. Academies are not running anywhere near full capacity yet, but beleaguered administrators are happy to see some light after a long period of darkness.

Indian Davis Cup coach Zeeshan Ali, who runs the Zeeshan Ali Tennis Academy on Sarjapur Road, said, “Less than 10% of the children have come back to the academy. Only those seriously pursuing the sport have returned. I am grateful that we have at least re-started operations. Getting a chance to be on the court and resume work is something I am grateful for. In terms of revenue and business, it’s absolutely not feasible. Last year, I had 12 coaches. Now, I have just two. We have stopped our residential program.”

Zeeshan explained that until schools reopen fully, the turnout at his academy will continue to be low. “For someone who is 13 or 14, and has played tennis for seven to eight years, to lose a year is tough. They are losing time,” he said.

The Karnataka Institute of Cricket (KIOC), which counts Manish Pandey, K. Gowtham and several other big names as its alumni, is slowly coming back to life. Irfan Sait, Director, KIOC, is cautiously optimistic.

“Around 35% of our wards are back. It is a huge improvement over the dark times when our gates were shut. While our senior players have been very keen to return, some parents are not comfortable with their young children returning,” he said.

To help compensate for the heavy losses suffered during the lockdown, he has had to make some tough decisions. “We had to reduce our staff. We had 12 groundsmen; now we have five. We had to let go of some of our hostel and office staff. We have also cut costs by being careful with electricity usage and so on,” he added.

The Champions Table Tennis Center, however, has not been able to re-start operations. The centre, established by Anjana Rao in the Transcend Group of Institutions campus in Jarganahalli, was forced to vacate the premises.

“We were unable to pay rent. We were hoping for some concession on rent, but it did not happen. We are looking for a new venue. I have received a lot of calls from parents who are keen to send their children to our table tennis camp. That is encouraging. We have two or three possible new venues in mind. So hopefully, we can get re-started soon,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/cscc2b/article32965661.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGSPORTSP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/sports-academies-resume-play/article32965662.ece

410,2020/10/29,MGM launches dedicated helpline for stroke treatment,"A dedicated helpline 044-42004200 and a stroke rapid response team was launched to mark World Stroke Day.

MGM Healthcare launched on Thursdaya dedicated helpline 044-42004200 and a stroke rapid response team to mark World Stroke Day. The helpline was inaugurated by actor R. Sarathkumar.

The Institute of Neurosciences and Spinal Disorders at the hospital has put in place a dedicated multidisciplinary team to treat people who have suffered stroke.

According to K. Sridhar, Director of the institute the moment a person calls the helpline a team of healthcare professionals drawn from neurology, emergency medicine, radiology and interventionist apart from nurses, would be ready to receive the patient and start treatment.

“By having such a team we have been able to reduce the door to needle time to 11 minutes,” said Dr. Sridhar. Across the world the golden hour is up to 30 minutes.

When a person suffers a stroke, every minute counts, doctors say. Stroke is a condition when the brain cells die due to lack of oxygen flow, which can also caused by blood clots in the brain blood vessels. Approximately 30,000 brain cells can die every second once the oxygen flow to the brain is stopped, he said.

The team would have protocols and would be able to handle an emergency without having to waite for a specialist to take over. He gave the analogy of the Formula 1 race where in a pit shop each car is serviced by a group of technicians and within seconds the car tyre is changed and it is ready to leave.

G. Arjun Das, senior consultant neurologist, said a centre to treat stroke was first established at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mgm-launches-dedicated-helpline-for-stroke-treatment/article32972712.ece
411,2020/10/29,"Government’s failure responsible for inundation of Chennai, alleges Stalin","“Chennai is not able to withstand rain even for a day. People fear that there will be a repeat of flooding that ravaged Chennai in December 2015.”

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Thursday alleged that the failure of the Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami and Local Administration Minister S.P. Velumani to take precautionary measures had resulted in inundation of Chennai following overnight rains.

“Chennai is not able to withstand rain even for a day. People fear that there will be a repeat of flooding that ravaged Chennai in December 2015,” he said in a statement.

Mr Stalin said that the Greater Chennai Corporation should have prepared for the monsoon by desilting stormwater drainages.

“Though Rs 750 crore was allotted for the purpose there was corruption and irregularities. It was brought to light by Arappor Iyakkam. But neither the DVAC nor the Vigilance Department of the Greater Chennai Corporation came forward to probe into the allegations,” he charged.

Mr Stalin accused the Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner and other engineers of having connived with Mr Velumani and failed in taking precautionary measures.

“The AIADMK government has failed to learn any lessons from the 2015 flooding and now its failure has angered the people. Water has stagnated on roads that look like ponds. Vehicular movement has come to a stand still,” he said.

Mr Stalin said Chennai already failed to face COVID-19 and now failed in its preparations for the rain. “The Chief Minister and Local Administration Minister should feel ashamed for the inundation of the City,” he said.

Contending that if urban local body elections were conducted, the councillors would have rushed to the field to be with the people, Mr Stalin charged the AIADMK Government had turned the administration of Greater Chennai Corporation into a laughing stock.

“Since the meteorological department has predicted heavy rain, efforts should be made to drain the water and make safety arrangements for people living in low lying areas,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/6cmv6m/article32972419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/governments-failure-responsible-for-inundation-of-chennai-alleges-stalin/article32972420.ece
412,2020/10/29,SIMS launches centre to treat dystonia and spasticity,"The centre will treat movement disorders using botulinum toxin injection.

A centre of excellence for treatment of dystonia and spasticity movement disorders was launched at SRM Institutes for Medical Science hospital on Thursday.

Termed BONDS (Botulinum ToxiN in Dystonia and Spasticity) the centre will treat movement disorders using botulinum toxin injection.

Health minister C. Vijaya Baskar inaugurated the centre. Chairman of SRM group Ravi Pachamuthu said, “With such fine clinical talents and resources available in-house, we at SIMS will continue to deliver high rates of successful clinical treatments for our patients.”

Director of Neurology department U. Meenakshisundaram said botulinum toxin injection is administered as an outpatient procedure and the treatment spans from three to six months with minimal side effects.

Botulinum toxin is produced by the bacteria clostridium botulinum, whose ingestion could lead to a disease called botulism in which muscles are paralysed.

Dystonias are a group of disorders which cause abnormal posturing or movements of a body parts because some muscle groups go into abnormal, asynchronous contraction. They cause significant disability and discomfort to the sufferers and are in general not very responsive to treatment with oral medications. A common type is the task-specific dystonia where it occurs only with specific tasks such as writing (writer’s cramps), playing musical instruments (such as piano, guitar, mridangam etc.) playing golf or billiards, or counting currency notes.

Spasticity is abnormal stiffness that happens in diseases of the brain and/or spinal cord. The stiffness can be pronounced and cause considerable difficulty in daily activities. It can happen in children due to cerebral palsy and other disorders. Post-stroke spasticity is common with paralysed limbs becoming stiff over time and cause impediments to further recovery.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/sims-launches-centre-to-treat-dystonia-and-spasticity/article32971446.ece
413,2020/10/29,How autumn colours dress Chennai round the year,"Chennai may not have a set autumn season but the brilliant red hues of many tree species growing in the city usher fall vibes throughout the year

It’s autumn all over Europe and America now. Everywhere you look on social media: Instagram, Facebook, Nature photography blogs, the grandeur and glory of autumn leaves stare you in the face.

“I am so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers” writes LM Montgomery in Anne of Green Gables. October is the most acclaimed season of the year in certain countries because of the ubiquitous fall colours of red, maroon, pink, orange, yellow and gold.

Chennai may not have a set autumn October but the hues of many tree species growing in the city usher in the feeling of Fall almost throughout the year. Certain plants produce more red pigments that mask the usual green foliage colour. These plants in the path of powerful sunlight develop vivid colours, which is the normal principle behind the blooming of bright flowers.

In the city, these flame colours are visible in both common avenue trees and rare plants locked up within private gardens. The most familiar ones that put forth leaves of autumn hues are mango, country almond and peepal. While the red shining foliage turns back to green in mango and peepal, the bright leaves in the country almond senesce from green to rich red shades and litter the ground beneath.

The swaying of the copper-tinged young peepal leaves is a sight to behold. Given their commonality and richness of the coloured pigments, it often makes me wonder whether natural dyes or food colouring can be extracted from these leaves!

A small tree often hidden as a rare exotic in home gardens is Surinam cherry. Its leaves, when young and sprouting, display a thorough red sheen. Similarly, the first sight of life in the shaving brush tree are young maroon leaves, on what would erstwhile be stripped branches resembling rotten wood. The trees are found in a few private gardens in Nungambakkam, Cathedral Road and Adyar.

When in Adyar, you can also spot the red barringtonia, a freshwater mangrove tree. Also found in Luz and Vedanthangal, these trees produce young flushed red leaves that mark the beginning of a new season, generally in October and April. The Malabar ebony in Guindy and Saidapet also burst forth brilliant red young leaves.

If you wish to enjoy an exclusive autumn in your own backyard, try planting the cannon ball tree, a species quite common in the city.

But the most classic of them all is the rare, visually-striking, deciduous lac tree (kusum) found in very few places in Chennai including Adyar and the Botanical Garden on Cathedral Road. The canopy it provides is straight out of a painting, with diverse hues of red and orange.

Amidst an unforeseen pandemic of this magnitude, these colours bring hope, reminding us of the permanence of change. As Robert Frost once wrote, ‘Sing a song of seasons! Something bright in all! Flowers in the summer, Fires in the fall!’",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/qgdtzd/article32971292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MP-Lac-Tree,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/autumn-in-chennai-red-trees/article32971297.ece

After a weak start on Wednesday, the northeast monsoon on Thursday brought intense thunderstorms over Chennai and its neighbourhood and triggered widespread heavy rainfall that continued well into the morning.

Chennai woke up to a typical monsoon day with overcast skies and intermittent rain that led to waterlogging in some areas.

The Meteorological Department has forecast that the rain over the city and neighbouring districts will continue for next three hours.

S. Balachandran, Deputy Director of Meteorology, Chennai, said an upper air circulation over southwest Bay of Bengal off north Tamil Nadu coast had influenced intense thunderstorms accompanied by lightning. The moist northeasterly winds that penetrated the coastal areas too triggered rain. Such intense rain with loud thunder and lightning is possible during the monsoon.

The number of younger patients reporting to hospitals with blood clots in large blood vessels had increased due to COVID-19, said Bhuvaneshwari Rajendran, consultant neurologist and neurophysiologist, Kauvery Hospital.

Addressing a virtual conference on ‘Stroke emergency and rapid response’ organised as part of The Hindu Wellness Series along with Kauvery Hospital on Wednesday, she said that the clots appeared to form as a result of the body’s immune response to COVID-19.

Sivarajan Thandeeswaran, senior consultant, stroke and neurovascular medicine, Kauvery Hospital, said a majority of such young patients who were reporting clots in blood vessels going to the limbs and heart had comorbidities, particularly diabetes and hypertension.

Highlighting the risk factors of stroke, Dr. Bhuvaneshwari stressed on the need for everyone to keep diabetes and hypertension under control to prevent stroke. Pointing out that stroke had a high mortality rate with roughly 41% of patients not surviving, Dr. Thandeeswaran said getting immediate medical attention was crucial.

Ennapadam S. Krishnamoorthy, neurologist, neuropsychiatrist and Founder of Buddhi Clinic, highlighted that though 25 % of stroke patients could get clot busting done, only 10 % of them get medical attention in time even in developed countries.

Speaking in detail on rehabilitation measures needed for stroke patients, he said that though stroke was related to the brain it affected the whole body. He said it affected physical, functional, cognitive, emotional and behavioural aspects of patients.

He said rehabilitation of stroke-affected patients was a team effort that started at the hospital’s intensive care unit and continued at home with the support of family members.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/x1s3yx/article32961618.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVID19CORONAVIRUS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/more-young-people-reporting-blood-clots-during-pandemic-say-experts/article32967729.ece

The National Green Tribunal has appointed a joint committee with representatives from various government agencies to evaluate the Integrated Storm Water Drain (ISWD) project of Kovalam basin and submit a report.

The bench of Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta has ordered that the committee must submit a report on whether the project needed Coastal Regulation Zone clearance and environmental impact of the ISWD on aquifer and coastal zone along the East Coast Road.

The joint committee will have officials from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Chennai Metrowater, Tamil Nadu Coastal Zone Management Authority, Water Resources Organisation, Public Works Department and National Institute of Ocean Technology.

The committee also needs to recommend methods to carry out the project without causing environmental impact on the aquifer and coastal areas. It must submit the report by December 4. This follows a case filed with the NGT seeking its intervention in preventing the construction of stormwater drains in ECR and affecting the aquifer.

Meanwhile, responding to the Greater Chennai Corporation’s press release on Tuesday, members of the VGP Golden Seaview Residents Welfare Association, Palavakkam, said rainwater can be easily drained with more recharge wells.

R. Balakrishnan, the association’s treasurer said, “Inundation during 2015 was manmade in the area as commercial establishments had let out stagnant water into the roads.”

Many residents’ associations have written to the GCC requesting to share data on the water table, environment impact assessment report and detailed project report.

Environmentalist Nityanand Jayaraman said the information specified by the Corporation, including rainwater harvesting through the project and flooding instances, could not be verified as project documents were not in the public domain.

Moreover, the high-tide line stretch between Palavakkam and Uthandi, had been identified as a Coastal Regulation Zone 1A and turtle nesting area. Discharging huge quantities of water in turtle nesting zones without an environmental impact assessment would have a serious impact on the species.

Mr. Jayaraman said the residential and commercial structures in 980 hectares were not entirely built up as made to appear by the GCC and had unpaved spaces, and comply with rainwater harvesting norms.

People in fishing hamlets alleged that the project would affect marine life. Harikrishna Sekar of Injambakkam said, “We are already travelling 15 km into the sea for fishing. The fish yield is likely to reduce further when water collected through the ISWD is drained into beaches.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ngt-forms-joint-panel-to-evaluate-ecr-integrated-stormwater-drain-project/article32967690.ece
420,2020/10/29,Coronavirus | 98% of discharged persons show lung recovery,"At post-COVID-19 ward, doctors assess lung function, cardiac capacity of persons

Healthcare providers at the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, Chennai, have been assessing the lung function and cardiac capacity of persons discharged after COVID-19 treatment by getting them to take a six-minute walk and a few steps up and down a platform. For a closer look at their lung conditions, a repeat CT (computed tomography) chest scan is done, and 98% patients have shown complete resolution of lung involvement.

The six-minute walk test around a demarcated space and the Harvard step test, along with an ECG, are part of assessments at the post-COVID-19 outpatient (OP) ward at the hospital. Six weeks after discharge, patients are screened and tested for the functional capacity of their lungs, heart and eyes, and their psychological well-being, according to a press release.

“The post-COVID-19 OP is a one-stop comprehensive facility for discharged persons. We assess the lung function of the patients through the walk test. We measure their oxygen saturation (SPO2) levels and heart rate before and after the test. The Harvard step test is a basic test to assess their effort tolerance. We assess both their pulmonary and cardiac capacity,” R. Jayanthi, dean of the hospital, said. Started on October 1, the OP has screened 186 persons — 148 men and 38 women — so far. As many as 85 of them had diabetes, 48 had hypertension and two had coronary artery disease. The OP has an automated Body Mass Index machine, while vitals such as pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate are checked as well.

Apart from lab services, including complete blood count and random blood sugar checks, the facility provides CT chest scans, lung function tests and using computerised spirometry that provides details on functional capacity of lungs and eye tests, for visual acuity and fundus, psychiatric counselling, among other things and breathing and simple physical exercises, followed by counselling by yoga and naturopathy practitioners.

Patients with 20% and higher lung involvement during hospitalisation are subjected to a repeat CT chest scan after six weeks to check for complete resolution or residual lesions. Of the 132 patients subjected to repeat CT chest scans, more than 98% showed complete resolution of lung involvement, while others showed resolving residual lesions, she said. Some patients who had more than 75% lung involvement in their initial CT scans also showed complete resolution during their visits to the OP.

The resolution of lung involvement due to COVID-19, doctors said, could be attributed to proper stratification and timely administration of drugs. Those with residual lesions were asked to come in for review after six weeks.

Three patients had significant psychiatric symptoms, for which clinical counselling was provided, the release said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/l1ardv/article32967678.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29OCTTHPOST-COVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/coronavirus-98-of-discharged-persons-show-lung-recovery/article32967679.ece

422,2020/10/29,"Port-Maduravoyal corridor may be redesigned, says Gadkari","Centre seeks waiver of royalty on steel, aggregate for project

The Chennai Port-Maduravoyal elevated corridor is likely to be re-designed into a double-decker project and have six to eight lanes, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday.

Addressing the media after meeting Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Mr. Gadkari said he had suggested this idea to the Chief Minister since the State government had sought more ramps. The fresh design would ensure that the corridor serves the public for at least 20 years, he said.

But since it would involve an increase in cost from ₹3,100 crore to ₹5,000 crore, Mr. Gadkari sought a waiver of SGST on steel and cement and royalty for sand and aggregate for the project. “It would lead to a notional loss of revenue to the State. But it would be of international standards and serve its purpose. The Centre and the National Highways Authority of India would bear the remaining cost,” he said, adding that Mr. Palaniswami had said he would hold discussions on the proposal and get back to him.

During the meeting, representatives of the State government had stressed the need for widening two stretches of NH 45 between Guduvanchery and Chettipunniyam and from Maduravoyal to Sriperumbudur NH4 into eight-lane roads. “It would cost ₹700 crore, and we have given an assurance that the projects would be taken up. But the State government has to ensure the availability of land,” he said.

Mr. Gadkari, who thanked the Chief Minister for agreeing to provide land for the proposed multi-modal logistics park near Chennai, said the plan was to put it out to tender by January 2021.

He said he had no objection to the handing over of NH 136 and NH 544H to the State government.

423,2020/10/29,65 babies born on a single day at the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,"This is well above the daily average of 45 to 50 deliveries at the institution

On the morning of October 28, doctors and staff of the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (IOG) and the Government Hospital for Women and Children, Egmore, were in for a surprise. A count revealed that as many as 65 babies, including a pair of twins, were born on October 27 in the hospital, well above the usual daily average of 45 to 50 deliveries.

S. Vijaya, director of IOG, said the number of deliveries at the hospital was not more than 45 to 50 on most days. “A few days ago, we had 54 deliveries. When we saw the hospital report for October 27 at 7 a.m. on Wednesday, we were surprised as we had 64 deliveries and 65 live births, including a pair of twins. We have not had so many deliveries on a single day in the recent past, and that too, in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic. The number of women approaching IOG for deliveries has increased during and post the lockdown period,” she said.

Among the 64 mothers, who gave birth at the hospital, four had tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 23 girls and 42 boys were born.

“We have admitted a number of pregnant women who had tested positive for delivery. The government maternity hospitals in the city were allocated for specific zones by the Chennai Corporation. Pregnant women who tested positive and reside in Ayanavaram, Thiru Vi Ka Nagar and Pulianthope come to IOG for delivery,” she said.

Dr. Vijaya added that the inflow of pregnant women to the outpatient department had also increased after the lockdown restrictions were relaxed.

“Our outpatient department is crowded. We are getting at least 150 to 200 patients a day when compared to 60 to 80 during the lockdown. After restrictions were relaxed, many women are coming for their regular gynaecology check-ups. We have also resumed performing surgeries while the infertility and oncology outpatient departments have also started to function,” she said.

426,2020/10/29,Fishermen must use tracking devices: Minister,"The Fisheries Department will insist upon fishers to use satellite phones and other tracking devices while going to sea to ensure their safety, especially during the monsoon.

In some cases such tracking equipment were not being put to use properly. The members of clusters were not sharing the satellite phones or not turning them on as they should. There have been complaints that fishers do not use tracking devices and when they go missing, it is extremely difficult to track them.

Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said that the government had been distributing satellite phones to clusters of boats that go deep sea fishing and that they must use the phones. “These are being given at 75% subsidy to ensure the safety of the fishers. During the Northeast monsoon that has just set, our control room will be tracking crafts. We will coordinate with the Meteorology department and other State government departments,"" he said.

A total of 500 satellite phones have been procured from BSNL at a cost ₹5.12 crore and they are being distributed in batches to beneficiaries. ""Even on Tuesday, we distributed 15 sets to various clusters,"" he said.

The satellite phones can be used by deep sea fishermen to communicate with the shore and among themselves. They can also to be used to track boats during times of distress and to disseminate weather warnings. One set costs ₹1 lakh approximately with the MPEDA bearing 50% of the cost.

427,2020/10/29,"Countering deepfakes, the most serious AI threat","It is crucial to enhance media literacy, meaningful regulations and platform policies, and amplify authoritative sources

Disinformation and hoaxes have evolved from mere annoyance to high stake warfare for creating social discord, increasing polarisation, and in some cases, influencing an election outcome. Deepfakes are a new tool to spread computational propaganda and disinformation at scale and with speed.

Access to commodity cloud computing, algorithms, and abundant data has created a perfect storm to democratise media creation and manipulation. Deepfakes are the digital media (video, audio, and images) manipulated using Artificial Intelligence. This synthetic media content is referred to as deepfakes.

Also read | The rise of deepfakes and threats to truth

A cyber Frankenstein

Synthetic media can create possibilities and opportunities for all people, regardless of who they are, where they are, and how they listen, speak, or communicate. It can give people a voice, purpose, and ability to make an impact at scale and with speed. But as with any new innovative technology, it can be weaponised to inflict harm.

Deepfakes, hyper-realistic digital falsification, can inflict damage to individuals, institutions, businesses and democracy. They make it possible to fabricate media — swap faces, lip-syncing, and puppeteer — mostly without consent and bring threat to psychology, security, political stability, and business disruption. Nation-state actors with geopolitical aspirations, ideological believers, violent extremists, and economically motivated enterprises can manipulate media narratives using deepfakes, with easy and unprecedented reach and scale.

Targeting women

The very first use case of malicious use of a deepfake was seen in pornography, inflicting emotional, reputational, and in some cases, violence towards the individual. Pornographic deepfakes can threaten, intimidate, and inflict psychological harm and reduce women to sexual objects. Deepfake pornography exclusively targets women.

Deepfakes can depict a person indulging in antisocial behaviours and saying vile things. These can have severe implications on their reputation, sabotaging their professional and personal life. Even if the victim could debunk the fake via an alibi or otherwise, it may come too late to remedy the initial harm. Malicious actors can take advantage of unwitting individuals to defraud them for financial gains using audio and video deepfakes. Deepfakes can be deployed to extract money, confidential information, or exact favours from individuals.

Deepfakes can cause short- and long-term social harm and accelerate the already declining trust in news media. Such an erosion can contribute to a culture of factual relativism, fraying the increasingly strained civil society fabric. The distrust in social institutions is perpetuated by the democratising nature of information dissemination and social media platforms’ financial incentives. Falsity is profitable, and goes viral more than the truth on social platforms. Combined with distrust, the existing biases and political disagreement can help create echo chambers and filter bubbles, creating discord in society.

Imagine a deepfake of a community leader denigrating a religious site of another community. It will cause riots and, along with property damage, may also cause life and livelihood losses. A deepfake could act as a powerful tool by a nation-state to undermine public safety and create uncertainty and chaos in the target country. It can be used by insurgent groups and terrorist organisations, to represent their adversaries as making inflammatory speeches or engaging in provocative actions to stir up anti-state sentiments among people.

Undermining democracy

A deepfake can also aid in altering the democratic discourse and undermine trust in institutions and impair diplomacy. False information about institutions, public policy, and politicians powered by a deepfake can be exploited to spin the story and manipulate belief.

A deepfake of a political candidate can sabotage their image and reputation. A well-executed one, a few days before polling, of a political candidate spewing out racial epithets or indulging in an unethical act can damage their campaign. There may not be enough time to recover even after effective debunking. Voters can be confused and elections can be disrupted. A high-quality deepfake can inject compelling false information that can cast a shadow of illegitimacy over the voting process and election results.

Deepfakes contribute to factual relativism and enable authoritarian leaders to thrive. For authoritarian regimes, it is a tool that can be used to justify oppression and disenfranchise citizens. Leaders can also use them to increase populism and consolidate power. Deepfakes can become a very effective tool to sow the seeds of polarisation, amplifying division in society, and suppressing dissent.

Another concern is a liar’s dividend; an undesirable truth is dismissed as deepfake or fake news. Leaders may weaponise deepfakes and use fake news and an alternative-facts narrative to replace an actual piece of media and truth.

Major solutions

To defend the truth and secure freedom of expression, we need a multi-stakeholder and multi-modal approach. Collaborative actions and collective techniques across legislative regulations, platform policies, technology intervention, and media literacy can provide effective and ethical countermeasures to mitigate the threat of malicious deepfakes.

Also Read Artificial Intelligence helps detect deepfake videos

Media literacy for consumers and journalists is the most effective tool to combat disinformation and deepfakes. Media literacy efforts must be enhanced to cultivate a discerning public. As consumers of media, we must have the ability to decipher, understand, translate, and use the information we encounter (https://bit.ly/2HFlUs8). Even a short intervention with media understanding, learning the motivations and context, can lessen the damage. Improving media literacy is a precursor to addressing the challenges presented by deepfakes.

Meaningful regulations with a collaborative discussion with the technology industry, civil society, and policymakers can facilitate disincentivising the creation and distribution of malicious deepfakes. We also need easy-to-use and accessible technology solutions to detect deepfakes, authenticate media, and amplify authoritative sources.

Deepfakes can create possibilities for all people irrespective of their limitations by augmenting their agency. However, as access to synthetic media technology increases, so does the risk of exploitation. Deepfakes can be used to damage reputations, fabricate evidence, defraud the public, and undermine trust in democratic institutions.

To counter the menace of deepfakes, we all must take the responsibility to be a critical consumer of media on the Internet, think and pause before we share on social media, and be part of the solution to this infodemic.

428,2020/10/29,The challenges of walking the Indo-Pacific talk,"In countering China, India must note that strategic talk alone cannot trump overriding economic realities

The recently concluded third annual United States-India 2+2 ministerial dialogue has amplified the ongoing conversation in India on the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), the Indo-Pacific, the threat from China, and, the United States as a potential ‘alliance’ partner. No strategic vision has captivated India’s foreign policy mandarins and strategic community in recent times as have the Indo-Pacific and the Quad.

The international community has once again decided to court New Delhi to play a decisive role in shaping the region’s strategic future. While during the mid-2000s the world expected India to be an economic powerhouse, a decade later, those expectations remain modest, at best. The expectation this time is more strategic and military, to lead the charge against China from within the region. Will India, and can India, fulfil these expectations?

Also read | Joint statement on the third U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial dialogue

The concepts, the differences

The Indo-Pacific is a grand politico-economic vision while the Quad is a forum for strategic and military consultations among India, the U.S., Australia and Japan. Depending on how one wishes to view it, they could be seen as conceptually interlinked or as separate visions. Their similarity comes from the fact that the Quad members are also major States in the Indo-Pacific region, and both the Quad and the Indo-Pacific constructs are focused on China. More so, they are also in some ways centred around India’s geographic location and its policies. Put differently, if you take China out of the equation, they would have little rationale for existence. And if you take India out of the picture, their ability to sustain as geopolitical constructs would drastically diminish.

At the same time, the Indo-Pacific and the Quad are also quite different from each other. The first is a politico-economic vision and the last is a military-strategic vision — the last does not form the military or strategic nucleus of the first. While the Indo-Pacific provides a complex political and economic picture with a hesitant, but growing, articulation of China as a strategic challenge, the Quad is inherently more anti-China in character and intent. The Indo-Pacific, despite the subtle anti-China undertones, will find it impossible to avoid engaging China. Even the Quad, still in its institutional infancy, is mostly focused on diplomatic signalling and with little common intent let alone joint action. At the moment it so seems, paradoxically however, that the Quad’s ability to succeed would entirely depend on China — the more aggressive China gets, the more resolute the Quad countries would be in strengthening it.

It is too early to say whether the Indo-Pacific as an economic construct will be able to pose an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The BRI is far more advanced, much more thought-out, and has the economic might of the Chinese state behind it. Several Indo-Pacific countries are already members of the BRI. On the flip side, the BRI is a ‘Chinese’ project and is already under immense stress from its inherent weaknesses, such as China’s unilateral pursuit of the BRI and the associated economic burdens on the States that sign up to it.

Hurdles in India’s strategy

Notwithstanding the current excitement in New Delhi about the Indo-Pacific, the question we must ponder over is how successful New Delhi’s Indo-Pacific strategy would be going forward. For a politico-economic construct such as the Indo-Pacific to survive, there must be strong economic partnerships and linkages among its members. Merely focusing on strategic talk and possible military cooperation will not work because at some point, the unavoidable economic logic will kick in.

With that in mind, let us examine India’s economic engagement of the Indo-Pacific. For one, New Delhi’s recent decision not to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the region’s flagship free trade arrangement, could potentially complicate the country’s future engagements in the region.

But that is not the complete story. The RCEP decision, a direct result of domestic political compulsions in India, comes in the backdrop of the already huge gap between India and China on trade with almost every Indo-Pacific country. The table shows the gap that exists between Indian and Chinese trade with the major Indo-Pacific and Quad States. This growing trade gap that India and China have with these countries will be a major determining factor in shaping the region’s strategic realities.

Also read | India, U.S. ink strategic defence pact

New Delhi’s decision not to sign on to the RCEP also needs to be viewed in the broader context of the Chinese institutional engagement of the region. Of the main countries of the Indo-Pacific, the bilateral free trade agreements are as follows.

In the case of India, it does not have FTAs with Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., Bangladesh and the Maldives. It has FTAs with South Korea, the Association of South East Asian Nations, or ASEAN, Japan and Sri Lanka. In the case of China, it has FTAs with all these countries barring the U.S. It does not have an FTA with Bangladesh, while negotiations are on with Sri Lanka. Trilateral FTA negotiations are also going on between China, Japan and South Korea.

Once again, economic compulsions will go a long way in shaping strategic realities for a variety of reasons including that trade with China is crucial for the economies of these States. Even if they attempt economic decoupling from China, it would be a long process, if pursued with adequate alternatives and political determination. The lesson is straightforward: strategic talk alone cannot trump economic realities.

China’s larger military reach

If our economic engagements with the region were insufficient, which are at least partly due to domestic political considerations, our strategic and military engagements in the region also fall short.

Beijing, for instance, is a major defence supplier to several of the region’s States including Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, dwarfing India’s minimal sales, defence dialogues and occasional joint military exercises in the region.

Economic role is key

Put differently, India’s role in the Indo-Pacific will remain limited if it does not prove to be a major economic partner to these States. But given the economic slowdown in India today in the wake of COVID-19 (compared to the much better place that China is in) and the lack of political consensus in the country about regional economic agreements such as the RCEP, India’s ability to economically engage with the region remains limited. On the military-strategic side too, India’s performance in the region is less than desirable. The only choice, it appears then, is for some sort of a loosely structured regional strategic alliance with the U.S. and its allies in the broader Indo-Pacific region. But let us be clear. There is a fundamental difference between sustainably engaging the Indo-Pacific region using economic, strategic and military tools, and choosing to take the easier and quicker path of a military ‘alliance’ with the U.S. and its allies.

Moreover, is there sufficient political consensus within the country’s strategic elite to pursue such a path? Having been socialised in the Cold War crucible of non-alignment, and later strategic autonomy, is the Indian strategic elite ready to embrace a new set of beliefs and ideas about a balancing act in international politics?

For sure, there is an unapologetic ‘realist’ turn in India’s foreign policy today, perhaps an unavoidable one, and the Indian debates on balancing and alliance formation are undergoing major changes as well. New Delhi, however, remains caught between a deeply constrained, but unavoidable, need to rethink its strategic posture, and the recognition of its material inability to do so, at least for now.

The issue of land can be a highly emotive issue anywhere in the world and Kashmir is no exception.

Therefore, one wonders whether the Centre’s unilateral action in notifying new land laws, without taking Kashmiris into confidence has been a well-thought-out one (Page 1, “Now, outsiders can buy land in J&K, October 28). There are likely to be more hurdles for the trouble-torn area to cross before it can experience peace, progress and prosperity. For successful implementation of any government initiative, it is quite essential to ensure the cooperation of the people. It is in the larger interests of the Centre to take positive steps — in initiating dialogue with political parties and civil society for large-scale peace.

Apologise he did

It was interesting to have an illustration of how one of the greatest cricketers of all time excelling as a splendid being too — in apologising to the West Indian cricket administration for having played cricket on invitation in the white minority-ruled Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe (OpEd page, ‘From the Archives – Fifty Years Ago’, October 27, 1970’, October 27). It was at a point in time when the ‘colour divide’ was rife. Not even a single person on earth would have blamed it on the legendary cricketer on nationality issues but he still sought pardon for the ‘crime’ of playing cricket in Rhodesia! It would be interesting to draw a comparison between this incident and those involving modern-day sportspersons, some with prickly egos. C.L.R. James once wrote of Sobers, “A man of genius is what he is, he cannot be something else and remain a man of genius.” How true, as a person and a player.

430,2020/10/29,Meet this masterchef paati,"Super Singer fame Shravan and grandmother Shantha Ragavan are getting popular on YouTube for their simple yet slick culinary pursuits

In 1955, a young Shantha Ragavan from Thanjavur visited her grandmother in Madras and learnt to cook.

Her grandmother oversaw her roasting a small pumpkin on the stove, which was then immersed in water to remove the skin. On an ammi (a traditional stone slab used for grinding) she ground sautéed dried red chillis, a ball of tamarind and salt. She added the peeled pumpkin and ground again, thus making her first-ever dish — pumpkin thogayal. Her father-in-law dotingly named her vaathiyar (master) for her cooking prowess with dishes like kondakadalai kozhambu (chickpeas), arisi vadai (rice vadas) and pongal.

Sixty-five years later, Shantha has made her YouTube debut with her grandson, 24-year-old singer RP Shravan, to document the recipes she learnt in her early life. Their channel is called Shantha Paati Samayal, and Shravan curates, shoots and edits on his smartphone.

An ardent singer, first runner-up in Super Singer Season 2 and among the top seven in Indian Idol Season 9, he sings popular devotional songs for his grandmother’s videos, amalgamating the music with her recipes.

From 2,000 subscribers in 2019, the channel has 88,000 subscribers now, drawn in by 34 videos that detail out not only recipes but also other kitchen tasks. The most watched video, with over 7.6 lakh views, is on How To Cut Cabbage.

Shantha uses lucid and conversational Tamil while explaining the recipes (there are subtitles for those who do not understand), and Shravan clears doubts from the background.

He says, “I try to figure out possible doubts and spontaneously ask paati, for the benefit of newbies watching the videos, who may have similar questions.”

Camera savvy

Shantha finishes her shot in one take, without any script. She says she owes it to her acting experience, as the heroine’s grandmother in Tamil film Thirumanam Ennum Nikkah.

In every video, she insists on one important aspect — zero wastage. When making arisi vadai, buttermilk invariably remains as a leftover. She urges her viewers to soak chopped banana stem in that buttermilk, to retain their colour, instead of throwing it away. She also narrates a life experience with every dish. Many comments read, “Watching paati gives us immense pleasure, like seeing our own.”

Says Shravan, “Festivals are classified based on gender, like Navratri being a women-centred one. To break that stereotype, I am cooking in this series.”

Shantha is proud of her grandson’s finesse in cooking: “Shravan learns the recipes just by observation. The house is filled with the aroma of the rasam he makes.” Shravan adds, “Before learning music, I used to play with cooking vessels as a toddler, and peek at my grandmother’s cooking in the kitchen.”

Shravan and his paati are now chalking out a Deepavali series, where they will be making sweets and savouries. Before that, they plan to post a video on puliyodarai, which is repeatedly requested by viewers.

The project takes effort, but Shantha is clearly enjoying the process. She says, “When I saw the first video of my recipe, I became so excited that I felt my age reverse to 18 from 81.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/u03m4y/article32973112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29MPGrandma-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/masterchef-paati/article32973117.ece
431,2020/10/29,Auroville’s popular Bread & Chocolate launches in Chennai,"Auroville’s popular Bread & Chocolate store is now open in Alwarpet, and offers a thoughtfully crafted menu that focusses on local talent, ethical sourcing and quality produce

Reassuringly, Bread & Chocolate, which just opened in Chennai, is a joyful manifestation of unwavering idealism and stubborn faith.

The man behind the bread is baker Daniel Trulson. A Chicago native, who met his wife in Auroville, Trulson believes in home grown, healthy, organic produce. The man behind the chocolate is Fabien Bontems. The Frenchman, along with his ex-partner Jane launched Mason & Co in Auroville seven years ago, determined to celebrate the potential of the undervalued Indian cacao bean.

Daniel cooks and bakes only with healthy fats: even his vegetables are roasted in raw cacao butter. Fabein untiringly advocates eco-friendly packaging, pushing back on plastic. Both are uncompromising when it comes to produce, insisting on thoughtful, responsible sourcing. They staff their kitchen with women, none of whom have any restaurant experience.

While this unrelenting attention to detail makes functioning more challenging, it is also the reason why the original, small, laidback Bread & Chocolate café, set on nondescript Kuilapalayam road, en route to Puducherry, quickly gained a cult following when it launched five years ago.

Croissant

After turning down multiple requests for collaboration from across the country, last year the duo met city restaurateurs Japtej Ahluwalia and Nikesh Lamba over chocolate croissants at their café, and agreed to open in Chennai.

Total makeover

The result is a sprawling flagship restaurant cheery with sunshine, bouncing off trays of billowing croissants with flaky crusts and steamy hearts.

A staffer from the original Bread & Chocolate, draped in a bright pink sari, giggles excitedly on a video call, showing her family the space. She pauses and swivels her camera phone so Daniel and Fabien can say hello to them as well. “It’s the first time she has been outside Auroville,” smiles Japtej, also waving, as he bounds up the stairs to explain the layout.

Formerly housing Bharat Bistro, the once-moody space is now open and inviting. The highlight is a surprising open air dining area tucked into a corner, where the older restaurant’s private dining used to be.

“It’s been a crazy roller coaster ride,” laughs Daniel, arriving at the table bearing warm loaves of his signature sourdough, a result of many years of experimentation with flour sourced from across India. Even now, with a reputation for baking some of the country’s best sourdough, he is on his toes, tweaking recipes everyday in response to humidity and ingredients. “It is easy to fall asleep at the wheel… I always motivate myself by challenging myself on a global scale,” he says. Along with regular and seeded versions, he has been experimenting with figs, spices and even a curry sourdough.

The café, open from 8 am, features updated Bread & Chocolate classics, and more. Try the summertime tartine, which shatters into warm buttery shards on every bite, filled with jammy roasted tomatoes, poached eggs, basil pesto and fresh ricotta.

Or dip into the bowls, including warm quinoa porridge, creamy chia pudding and a tropical smoothie chunky with fruits, granola and toasted coconut. There are vegan and gluten free options, including pancakes with cashew cream, a tofu scramble with honey chimichurri and diary free smoothies made with coconut milk.

Avocado toast, a hipster staple, is served with capers and almond dukkah here. And of course, in addition to babka, quiches and apple tarts, there are a range of croissants, stuffed with chocolate or studded with crisp almonds. As well as their signature ‘bread and chocolate’ — hefty slices of sourdough generously piled with dark chocolate, sea salt and honey.

Created in collaboration with Subko, in Mumbai, known for its small batch artisan roasts, the coffee counter boasts an array of drinks, including iced barrel aged cascaras, cold brew bottles and coffee-tonic.

At the chocolate bar, Fabian, who has spent the past seven years working with Indian cacao growers and processors, is enjoying creating bonbons using coconut, coffee, nuts and cacao nibs.

“Coffee and chocolate are very different but also similar,” he says, discussing how attention to farming and processing over the last few years has resulted in Indian coffee beans and cacao earning global attention.

“One of our main goals is to show people that India has high quality ingredients,” Fabien says, pausing to add with a smile, “India has everything.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/gkcieq/article32970314.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPBread-and-Choc,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/aurovilles-popular-bread-chocolate-launches-in-chennai/article32970315.ece
432,2020/10/29,Bombay HC hears PILs against reportage in Sushant case,"We would not like the media to cross its boundaries, says court

Referring to the reportage by the media in the case of death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, the Bombay High Court (HC) on Thursday said, “We would not like the media to cross it boundaries and we would also like to be within our boundaries.”

A Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a bunch of public interest litigations (PILs) seeking a direction from the court to issue guidelines to be followed by all media houses — print, television, radio, internet — to refrain from publishing and curtailing any comments which may jeopardise the reputation of the police or hinder the case.

The court asked the government to state by November 6 if such reportage adversely affects the probe and subsequent trial, and if the court should issue guidelines on media reporting.

The Bench said, “If there is excessive reporting, that can put an accused on guard, and he may resort to destroying evidence or absconding. Or if that person is actually innocent, the excessive media reporting can damage his reputation.”

The court told Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh to find out if excessive reporting by the media in an ongoing investigation meant interference in the process of administration of justice under the Contempt of Courts Act.

The Bench asked “Whether excessive reporting by media in an ongoing investigation amounts to interference in administration of justice under of the Contempt of Courts Act and should we lay guidelines? This is the issue before us.”

It also asked Mr. Singh to consider scenarios where such reportage about an ongoing probe, where a chargesheet was yet to be filed, influenced the investigating officer, or resulted in a witness being threatened.

The Bench went on to say, “If media identifies that a person is a very vital witness, he could be won over, threatened, or he could be even physically harmed so that he does not give evidence.”

The Bench also said, “Think of a police officer. Can anyone guarantee that he will not be influenced? He may be following a particular track. Media says no no this must be the track. He loses track and rounds up an innocent person.”

“Or, if the officer is competent and does not get influenced, then the media starts maligning him. Is this welcome in a society governed by rule of law?” the court asked.

The court added questions for Mr. Singh and said, “Is there any law which says that whatever an investigation agency collected as evidence should be laid before the public? Where is the obligation for the investigating officer to disclose evidence? How does the postmortem report come to the press unless of course it is disclosed? Should we lay down guidelines on these aspects?”

The court directed Mr. Singh to file his replies and adjourned the matter to be heard on November 6.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yc5wqa/article32693823.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUSHANT1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/can-excessive-media-reporting-hinder-justice-bombay-hc-asks-centre/article32973640.ece
433,2020/10/29,Coronavirus | Maharashtra Minister Dilip Walse-Patil tests positive,"Over a dozen State Ministers, including Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, have tested positive for the disease over the past few months.

Senior Nationalist Congress Party leader and Maharashtra Minister for Excise and Labour Department, Dilip Walse-Patil, on Thursday tested positive for COVID-19.

A legislator from Ambegaon in Pune district, Mr. Walse-Patil tweeted about his health condition, while stressing that he was perfectly fine and was undergoing treatment as a precautionary measure.

“Recently, I had undergone a COVID-19 test whose results have returned positive. However, my health is fine and I am not experiencing any trouble. I urge others who have come in contact with me to get themselves tested as well,” tweeted the six-time MLA.

A few days earlier, Mr. Walse-Patil’s fellow partymen — Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and former Minister Sunil Tatkare — tested positive.

Mr. Walse-Patil was present along with the NCP brass when former BJP leader Eknath Khadse joined Sharad Pawar’s party on October 23.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/nomegq/article30116804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/patiljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/coronavirus-maharashtra-minister-dilip-walse-patil-tests-positive/article32972902.ece

Based on a specific information, the Mumbai unit led by zonal director Sameer Wankhede on Tuesday seized the contraband, which was concealed in a submersible bore water pump, headed from Karnataka to Qatar via Mumbai, the official said.

The material inside the casing of the pump was taken out and contraband was kept inside it, wrapped in an aluminium foil with a copper wire around it to avoid detection during screening, he said.

As this was an unclaimed seizure, no arrest has been made in this case so far, he said, adding the NCB’s probe is under way.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ncb-seizes-contraband-hidden-in-courier-shipment-in-mumbai/article32968341.ece
435,2020/10/29,Plea against NCW Chairperson over ‘love jihad’ tweet,"A petition was filed before the Bombay High Court on Wednesday seeking a direction to remove Rekha Sharma, the Chairperson of the National Commission for Women (NCW), over her tweet on ‘love jihad’.

Saket Gokhale, a social activist, filed the petition stating that NCW is meant to be an independent body for protection of women’s rights, and its Chairperson engaging in such blatantly communal and divisive discourse casts aspersions on the body’s ability to act in a non-partisan and secular manner. The invocation of “rising cases of love jihad by the Chairperson, when no such cases even exist, points to a communal dog whistle policy which is intended to target the Muslim community, vilify inter-faith couples, and create discord in society”, it said.

The plea quotes the tweet by Ms. Sharma: “Our Chairperson @sharmarekha met with Shri Bhagat Singh Koshyari, His Excellency, Governor of Maharashtra & discussed issues related to #womensafety in the state including defunct One Stop Centres, molestation & rape of women patients at #COVID centres & rise in love jihad cases.”

The petition mentions, “The last part of this tweet refers to something called “love jihad”, which is not an officially recognised term under Indian law. This term is usually used in an informal context to refer to a baseless conspiracy theory that Muslim men are waging “jihad” (holy war) against Hindus by making Hindu girls fall in love with them, with the sole intention of converting them to Islam.”

Mr. Gokhale, petitioner-in-person, also adds, “There are old tweets of the Chairperson which are extremely misogynist and sexist for the purpose of making political attacks.”

He adds, “There has been a violation of Articles 14 (equality before law), 21 (protection of life and personal liberty) and 25 (all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practice, and propagate religion subject to public order, morality and health) of the Indian Constitution by Ms Sharma.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/d9jvwk/article32967523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29TH-REKHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/plea-against-ncw-chairperson-over-love-jihad-tweet/article32967524.ece
436,2020/10/29,HC directs BMC to pay salaries to 268 visually impaired employees,"Civic body’s circular and its action of withholding pay is illegal, says court

The Bombay High Court on Wednesday directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to pay salaries to 268 visually impaired employees, who were not paid during the lockdown, and said, “Denying benefits during the pandemic was ‘illegal’.”

The differently abled employees are members of the National Association for Blind (NAB). A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation filed by the NAB through advocate Uday Warunjikar after the civic body did not pay full salaries to the 268 employees.

Mr. Warunjikar said initially the BMC had exempted all its staffers from reporting to work. While the disabled employees were paid in full for the period between March 23 and May 31, in the subsequent months, the civic body began to make deductions for the days that they missed work, the petitioner said.

A circular was issued by the BMC that said permissible leave needed to be sanctioned by senior authorities, and for the days that such leave was not sanctioned, an employee would have to undergo a loss of pay.

The court said, “The circular requires judicial intervention. The circular and its action of withholding pay is held illegal.”

The court said that physically disabled employees, including the petitioner, were eligible for all monetary benefits, and directed the BMC to pay its physically disabled employees, even those ‘who could not report to duty during the pandemic,’ all salary arrears and due monetary benefits.

The Bench said that the payment must be made in two instalments, the first must be paid before Diwali and the second must be paid within 45 days from the date of the first instalment.

The BMC had previously said, “Around 1,150 physically disabled people, including the 268 visually impaired ones, are its staff members, and that it had started bus services for them.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/n47rgt/article31960285.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-BOMBAY-HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-directs-bmc-to-pay-salaries-to-268-visually-impaired-employees/article32967790.ece
437,2020/10/29,"MNS, Sena warn Kumar Sanu’s son over remarks on Marathi language","Parent company of Colors channel that broadcasts reality show Bigg Boss apologises to Uddhav Thackeray

Singer Kumar Sanu’s son Jaan Kumar Sanu on Wednesday landed in a controversy over his objectionable comments against the Marathi language in the reality television show Bigg Boss on Colors channel, with the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) warning physical violence against him while the ruling Shiv Sena sought strict action.

Sensing the trouble, Viacom18 Media Private Limited, who runs the channel, apologised to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, saying the objectionable part would be removed from all future broadcasts of the episode. Mr. Sanu during the show had warned another participant to not speak in Marathi in front of him as he got irritated listening to it.

“He gets irritated by Marathi and he wants to make a big name for himself in the entertainment industry by living in Mumbai. We will see to it that it never happens. We will beat you,” said Ameya Khopkar, president, cinema wing of the MNS.

Mr. Khopkar said that Colors channel should have edited that part before broadcasting it. “Since it did not, we got to know, who the traitor was. Now I nominate you to get kicked out of Mumbai,” he said.

Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik too reacted asking whether the channel was purposely promoting such controversy to increase the TRP of its show. “Mr. Sanu should be kicked out of the show. If the channel fails to do so, our party workers will stage a Sena style protest on the set of the Bigg Boss,” Mr. Sarnaik said.

On Wednesday afternoon, the parent company of the channel sent a letter to Mr. Thackeray. “We hereby apologise if we have inadvertently hurt the feelings of the people of Maharashtra due to the broadcast of the said comment in relation to the Marathi language. We value the audience and the patronage of the Marathi speaking audience and respect all languages of India in the same manner,” it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mns-sena-warn-kumar-sanus-son-over-remarks-on-marathi-language/article32967785.ece
438,2020/10/29,"Koshyari sends coffee book to Pawar, gets sarcasm, taunts in compliment","When Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari sent a coffee book named ‘Jana Rajyapal - Bhagat Singh Koshyari’, detailing his one year in the office, to Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, he never expected that he would receive a letter full of sarcasm from the veteran politician.

Mr. Pawar in his letter dated October 21 to the Governor said there was no mention of term ‘jana rajyapal’ (people’s Governor) in the Constitution, referring to the title of the book. He further took a dig saying “despite such mention I am thankful for receiving a copy of the book.”

Mr. Pawar also made a sarcastic reference to the early-morning swearing-in of Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar undertaken by Mr. Koshyari. He wrote, “After going through the coffee table book, I saw photographs of swearing-in ceremonies except one or two, and the coffee book also mentions about welcome ceremonies, convocation functions and meetings with dignitaries in the limited period of yours.”

“In addition, you seem to not have taken note of the advice Union Home Minister gave to you on your advice to the Chief Minister on secularism,” Mr. Pawar taunted. Union Home Minister Amit Shah in his interview to CNN-News 18 had said that the Governor could have avoided the selection of particular words in a letter written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.

Mr. Koshyari while referring to the issue of reopening temples had written to Mr. Thackeray asking whether he had turned secular.

Mr. Pawar in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi had criticised the immoderate language used by Mr. Koshyari towards the CM.

439,2020/10/29,Seven booked for vandalising NMMC hospital in Vashi,"Seven people, including three women, were booked on Wednesday for allegedly vandalising the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) hospital in Vashi following the death of a 50-year-old man. Of the seven, the four men were arrested.

The patient, Venkatesh Suryavanshi, a resident of Juhu gaon, was shifted from a private hospital in Koparkhairane to the NMMC hospital on Tuesday afternoon. At the time of admission, Suryavanshi, who had tuberculosis, was in a critical condition and had very low oxygen levels. An antigen test had declared him negative for COVID-19.

“At the time of admission, after checking his condition, vitals and the history papers, we had said that his chances of survival are very less. He was admitted to the ICU ward,” Prashant Jawade, medical superintendent, NMMC hospital, said.

Suryavanshi died during treatment around 3.45 a.m. on Wednesday. After getting to know about the death, his sons Rupesh (22) and Sandesh (20), along with their friends Pankaj Jadhav (22) and Rohit Namwad (32) entered the ICU ward and started vandalising the department. Three women who followed them assaulted security guard Satish Dere.

“I was told that they also carried a few sharp weapons with them. The security guard has received injuries. Our engineers are analysing the damage and finding the losses that we incurred,” Mr. Jawade said. Chief Medical Officer Majur Shaikh and a few other hospital staff were also allegedly attacked.

According to the police, the seven had vandalised three ventilators, one dialysis machine, two fans, one table fan, and two nurse stations. “The sons of the deceased ran a rental service of vehicles. We arrested the four men and would be producing them before court on Thursday,” senior police inspector Sanjeev Dhumal from Vashi police station said.

441,2020/10/29,"Need a socially-distanced holiday? Just set sail, say coastal cities","In a socially-distanced post-Covid-19 world, sailing, kayaking and other water-based solo sports are finding popularity among people looking for adventure

It was an unusual Sunday in an unusual year for Sendil Nath. Six kilometres into the Bay of Bengal, atop a yacht, as he manned the boom and pulled the ropes to steer the boat under his captain Dheer Singhi’s orders, he felt a familiar thrill.

“There were times the wind was so strong, it felt like the boat would almost capsize,” says the 41-year-old former motorbike racer, “That rush I felt while racing was back after 15 years.”

Empty blue waters reflected the sunset as Sendil, his wife, and two six-year-olds sitting at the nose of the boat looked on, and Dheer brought out a cake for the kids to cut.

A day at sea is one of the main thrills that Sportifying India, a city-based niche sports company is offering. “People come looking to escape city life. Once you have exited the harbour, it no longer feels like you are in Chennai,” says Dheer, who co-founded Sportifying India, along with fellow international sailors, Abhimanyu Panwar and Avinash Shanbhag.

As cities limp cautiously back to recovery, entertainment avenues are still limited. Niche watersports such as sailing, kayaking, paddling and canoeing hope to fill the void.

“Sailing is not a team sport. You are on a boat and on your own (in the case of single-handed boats). You may have one more person as a crew member, but social distancing is part of the game,” points out Dennis Luiz, commodore of the Ernakulam Sailing Association in Kerala. After a hiatus since the lockdown when it had to down oars, the association is gearing up to reopen soon.

Setting sail

After launching in November 2019, Sportifying India had to put an early brake on its operations due to the pandemic. But once the Chennai harbour opened up to commercial activities, in late September, they resumed the sailing trips, starting by inviting city musicians such as Maalavika Manoj and The F16 band for a day of music and fishing.

“We first ask people what kind of experience they are looking for. Some want to celebrate a birthday or an anniversary, some just want to go out to sea. We curate the trip accordingly. We could get a cake or decorate the boat with balloons,” says Dheer, adding that all COVID-19 protocols of wearing masks and sanitising are followed. “If you wish, you can come in lesser numbers so that you feel more safe,” he adds.

Sportifying India gets sailing trip requests for birthday parties and anniversaries

Dheer and his team are members of the Royal Madras Yacht Club, and so, have access to the harbour. People who want to go on a trip can book three days in advance to get the team to make their passes from Chennai Port. “You can hang around the harbour and the club, and take in the sights, before moving to the boat and out at sea,” he says.

While sailing has just restarted in Chennai, the Global Sailing Club in Kochi, a seven-year-old association, has been back in business since June. In fact, the number of people participating in sailing has doubled since last year, says OC Thomas, founder of the sailing club, adding that up to 40% of them were newcomers. “People learn sailing but mostly, they want to make a whole day out of it — they come with their families to sail, have lunch, drinks and then head back,” he says.

This strategy of promoting water sports at a family level, is one that even the Ernakulam Sailing Association has embraced. “The idea is to rope in adults who are interested. So, when they join, their family too, especially kids, jump on the bandwagon. This helps generate interest at an early age. Sailing is for the young and the old,” Dennis says.

Saying yes to sports Sailing became the first sport to host a state level meet in Telangana. In October, the Telangana Sailing Association, with the Yacht Club of Hyderabad organised the Junior State Championship. Young sailors from villages across the state were brought to the capital and a strict COVID-19 bubble was maintained. “We tested people thrice: before, during and after,” says Suheim Sheikh, president of the Yacht Club.

The championship would have been hosted in July, but despite lighter winds in October, the association decided to go ahead. “The whole world is sailing, somebody had to take the lead in India. It is important to carry on life and move ahead. The whole idea of living with Covid is well and truly alive today,” says Sheikh.

About a week ago, Kollam’s Syzygy Ecosports restarted kayaking and canoeing, for up to three people. Located at Pozhikkara beach, it takes its customers to the Paravur backwaters and the Ithikkara river. “We already have bookings made by residents of Trivandrum and Varkala. They prefer weekdays, while on weekends we get visitors from nearby resorts,” says Dani George, founder.

Explaining that the company wants to ensure the activities are private enough for customers to feel safe, he says, “We allow only two groups per day, and both can’t visit simultaneously,” he adds. “A lifeguard is there to escort the group on another kayak, at two arms’ length.”

In still waters

Dani describes how paddling in the Ithikkara River, when you cross a mangrove forest, feels like a mini-Amazon. “Even at midday, there is no sunlight, the canopy is that thick and tall. You can also get out of the canoe onto a sandbar. It is a good place to take a break and rest, and play volleyball. During high tides, it appears as if you are standing on the surface of the water,” he says.

Being stifled at home for a few months has clearly increased appreciation for the outdoors. This, Chennai-based Kumaran Mahalingam, founder of Paddle for Future, discovered looking at his sales over the past few months.

The company expanded its Mangrovebay Ecocamp in Chidambaram near Pichavaram and now includes sunrise kayaking. “If we had 50 bookings a month before the pandemic, it has increased to 150 now, post the lockdown,” says Kumaran cheerily. “The value of being in Nature has increased.”

The ecocamp takes a maximum of 14 people per day, and the 10-acre campus makes social distancing easier. Guests come in a day in advance, stay the night in tents or bunks, kayak early morning, have breakfast and then head back to the city.

Its Work From Camp programme sees people staying there for longer — the 9 to 5 day begins with a round of kayaking in the morning and paddling in the evening. “We take the kids to a beach near Pichavaram and teach them about the ecosystem there. We have also introduced silambam training on the beach,” says Kumaran

Kumaran and his family live the outdoor life they preach. For 100 days, from March to July, and again for the past three weeks, they have been living by the mangroves. “We spotted wild otters every day last month.” But the best part? “My 10-year old son became an expert in kayaking and bird watching.”

442,2020/10/29,VCK blames Centre for delay in implementing OBC reservation,"Party will launch an agitation, says VCK leader

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder president Thol. Thirumavalavan on Wednesday blamed the BJP-led Central government for the delay in implementing 50% reservation for OBC students in the all-India quota for medical admission.

Interacting with the media after participating in an agitation organised by the VCK here on the reservation issue, he said the BJP government was solely responsible for not implementing 50% reservation in medical admission this year.

If implemented, the biggest beneficiary was the OBC students belonging to the Hindu community, he said.

He also blamed the Centre for the delay by the Governor in giving sanction for implementing 7.5% reservation for government school students in medical colleges.

The Governor seemed to be functioning at the behest of the Centre, he said adding the party would launch an agitation against the Centre on the reservation policy.

Leaders belonging to the Congress, CPI and CPI (M) also participated in the protest near Anna Salai.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/gefqz9/article32968764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THVCKPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/vck-blames-centre-for-delay-in-implementing-obc-reservation/article32968765.ece

The Chief Minister had also stated that if the Lt. Governor failed to give accord to the Cabinet decision, he would launch an agitation against her. The statement showed that the reservation decision was more political and not aimed at the welfare of the students, the AIADMK leader said.

446,2020/10/29,U.T. begins post-COVID survey among recovered patients,"Efforts to identify after-effects that will need medical, psychological intervention

The Union Territory has launched a post-COVID survey among recovered patients to identify those with after-effects that would require medical or psychological intervention.

Teams of ANMs and ASHA workers are engaged in door-to-door visits of patients, who recovered from the COVID-19 infection and were discharged, to assess their general health status.

The recovered patients are asked to fill in a 17-point questionnaire that elicits details ranging from intensity of coronavirus on a scale of mild to moderate to severe, institution of hospitalisation and duration of stay to a checklist of symptoms — fever, fatigue, anxiety, breathlessness, joint pain, headache, loss of taste/smell, chest pain, blurring of vision or any other discomfort.

The survey will also check for their co-morbidities, whether there was any instance of visiting the doctor for illness or any investigation/medicines were adopted for post-COVID issues.

“The survey will provide us some insights into COVID-19 sequel to guide a long-term follow-up or treatment programme,” said T. Arun, Health Secretary. “The initial survey is being undertaken by ASHA workers and ANMs and based on the data, we will make available specialist services of doctors and nurses, from medical to psychological counselling, to those who require it. If needed, they will be referred to an institution,” Mr. Arun said.

The plan is to set up a secondary-level network of post-COVID clinics in hospitals, PHCs and focus centres as part of providing a continuum of care, extending well beyond recovery and discharge from an institution.

“The survey is half-way through in regions such as Mahe and Yanam though in Puducherry, it could take more time as the cumulative number is higher and increasing by the day here,” said S. Mohan Kumar, Health Director.

The Union Territory, with a recovery rate averaging 85% in recent weeks, has an aggregate of over 30,000 recovered patients.

As of Wednesday, there were 30,307 recovered patients in the Union Territory. Puducherry had 24,653 recovered patients, Karaikal 3,116, Yanam 1,796 and Mahe 742.

Long-term monitoring

“It is remarkable that so far there has not been a single post-COVID death, especially among the subset of recovered patients with co-morbidity. A long-term monitoring will help prevent post-COVID casualties,” said Mr. Arun.

Officials expect the post-COVID survey to be completed in the Union Territory in the next 10 days.

Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao said that based on the consolidation of feedback, a treatment plan would be framed for the subset of patients who still suffer from any long-term problem after recovery.

Mr. Rao said preliminary results of surveys showed that a significant proportion of recovered patients in the range of about 5% were carrying some medical problem even months after discharge.

“We have asked the teams to complete the survey for the entire Union Territory by this week,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/7hj35o/article32968617.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THCOVIDSURVEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ut-begins-post-covid-survey-among-recovered-patients/article32968618.ece

The Union Territory logged its lowest COVID-19 infection rate in over five months as 102 cases emerged from testing 3,792 samples on Wednesday.

Puducherry accounted for 75 of the new cases, Karaikal and Yanam eight each and Mahe 11.

The test positivity rate fell to 2.68% in the last 24 hours while the case fatality rate was 1.71% and the recovery rate stood at 87.64%.

Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao said it has been decided to strengthen monitoring of home isolation patients to cut down deaths further.

Of the 3,686 active cases in the Union Territory, 2,146 patients were under home quarantine.

“Instead of tele-counselling, we have decided to send teams of doctors and nurses to undertake daily assessment of the patients,” Mr. Rao said.

The capital registered two deaths to take the cumulative toll to 590. With this, the toll in the capital aggregated to 487 followed by Karaikal (55), Yanam (42) and Mahe (six).

Awareness campaigns

The Minister said the awareness campaigns would be intensified ahead of the extended festive season that was due to commence with Deepavali falling in the middle of next month when tourist footfall would increase exponentially in the city.

“It is that much more important that people adhere to wearing masks and maintain physical distancing over the next couple of months to preempt an upsurge in infections,” he said.

448,2020/10/29,Gold smuggling case | Demand for Kerala CM’s resignation gets shriller,"The Congress and the BJP unleashed a wave of protests across the State.

The Opposition’s demand for the resignation of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan got shriller on Thursday with a court in Kochi remanding his former Principal Secretary, M. Sivasankar, in the custody of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for a week of questioning in connection with money laundering aspect of the UAE consulate linked gold smuggling case.

The Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unleashed a wave of protests across the State accusing Mr. Vijayan of allowing economic offenders to harness the heft of his office to facilitate the smuggling of gold in air freight addressed to foreign officials at the diplomatic mission here.

Youth Cong. workers dispersed

The police used their water cannon to disperse Youth Congress workers who attempted to storm the Chief Minister’s official residence at the Cliff House here. BJP protesters tried to topple the barricade and push their way into the government Secretariat through the police cordon guarding the gates.

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary K.P. Anil Kumar said party workers would hold torchlight processions at the panchayat and municipal ward level in the evening to highlight Mr. Vijayan's “culpability” in the racket.

On the 65th anniversary of the creation of the State of Kerala on November 1, BJP workers would line up in a physically distanced manner on the side of State and National Highways to form a human chain to highlight Mr. Vijayan's alleged link with economic offenders.

Local body polls

The gold smuggling scandal has unfolded as Kerala prepares to hold local body elections in December.

The ED’s filing in court that Mr. Sivasankar had often called Customs inspectors to expedite the release of freight sent from Dubai in the name of UAE Consulate officials without inspecting the incoming goods or levying duty appeared to have provided ammunition to the Opposition to target the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) and Mr. Vijayan directly.

Chennithala’s claim

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the overlapping investigations into the gold smuggling racket would expose the role of more officials in the CMO.

He said the ED and Customs were set to question them and claimed Mr. Vijayan’s turn would come soon. Mr. Sivasankar had merely done Mr. Vijayan’s “bidding”. He was just a “pawn”. Mr. Vijayan was the real culprit, Mr. Chennithala alleged.

The government and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was “up to the neck in criminality”. The ED was questioning Binish Kodiyeri, son of CPI(M) State secretary, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, in Bengaluru on suspicion of extending financial aid to a trafficker in narcotic drugs. The ED was verifying his sources of income and could arrest him on charges of money laundering. “It seems all crimes lead to the CPI(M) or the CMO,” Mr. Chennithala said.

‘Two Ministers involved’

BJP State president K. Surendran said Central agencies were probing the role of two Ministers in the gold smuggling case. He refused to identify them and claimed their “discreditable” activities would come to light soon.

Central law enforcement agencies were set to question them. He said two officials attached to the CMO were also under the scanner of the agencies. Mr. Surendran alleged that Mr. Vijayan was the “kingpin of the racket”. His friends and relatives had benefited from the smuggling and also the illegal inflow of foreign funds, he charged and said the Chief Minister had lost the right to continue in office, he said.

CPI(M) defends CM

The CPI (M) has stoutly defended Mr. Vijayan. Party Central Committee member M.V. Govindan said the Chief Minister would serve out the rest of his term and the LDF would sweep to power in the coming local body and Assembly elections.

He said the Congress and the BJP had scant credibility and claimed that the public would see through their lies and vote for the development and social welfare achievements of the LDF government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/83uj1e/article32971019.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MAHILA-MORCHA-protest,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/gold-smuggling-case-demand-for-kerala-cms-resignation-gets-shriller/article32971020.ece
449,2020/10/29,"Want EB to be a possession-based team, says Fowler","Liverpool legend is eager to make an impression in the ISL

East Bengal coach Robbie Fowler is keen to make a mark in the ISL with a unique style of play — a combination of the gegenpress and tiki-taka.

“We want to be a possession-based team, but not have possession just for the sake of it. This is probably where a lot of people get perplexed in terms of how you say you want to play or how you are a long-ball team. In football, it doesn't matter if the right pass is from five yards or 50 yards out. We want to be a team that keeps the ball, probes the opposition defence and is defensively rock solid,” Fowler told Sportstar.

Elaborating on the club’s bold step in hiring former Blackpool manager Terry McPhillips as a set-piece coach, a concept unheard of Indian football, the Liverpool legend said: “Maybe it is a little bit of a pioneer. But look at Liverpool last year – they had a throw-in coach. Why can't we have one? We've got someone who can benefit us from a defensive point of view and a tactical point of view in terms of corners, free kicks or throw-ins.”

Having been a part of many a derby during his playing days, Fowler understands the sentiments surrounding the Kolkata derby.

“Derbies are derbies, and it is a case of trying to better the opposition. You've to play with your head and cannot be just playing with your heart all the time because there will be 11 red cards if that was the case. We know what the derby means, and we know what we need to do,” he said. “There's going to be millions and millions of people supporting us when we're playing and it's up to us to try and give that little bit of spirit back to the fans,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/7w45az/article32975719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30ROBBIE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/want-eb-to-be-a-possession-based-team-says-fowler/article32975720.ece
450,2020/10/29,Champions League | Barcelona eases past Juventus,"Chelsea, Manchester United hit the cruise button

An early goal from Ousmane Dembele and a late Lionel Messi penalty gave Barcelona a 2-0 win away to Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday after Alvaro Morata had three goals disallowed for offside for the Serie A side.

Dembele struck with a deflected shot in the 14th minute for a Barcelona side smarting from Saturday’s home defeat by Real Madrid. Juventus, still missing Cristiano Ronaldo after he tested positive for COVID-19 two weeks ago, was frustrated as Morata had two goals disallowed in the first half and a third after halftime when VAR showed that his heel was offside.

Juve’s frustration was complete as defender Merih Demiral was sent off in the 85th minute and Messi settled the match with a stoppage-time penalty to leave Barcelona top of Group G with six points and Juventus on three.

Marcus Rashford scored a hat trick as Manchester United beat Leipzig 5-0 at home, while Chelsea brushed aside Krasnodar 4-0 in Russia, giving England’s four clubs a sweep of wins this week without conceding a goal.

Second-half goals

A wave of second-half goals also earned wins for Paris Saint-Germain — after losing Neymar early to injury — Borussia Dortmund and Sevilla.

United has the maximum six points from its opening two games in its group.

Chelsea kickstarted its group campaign thanks to goals from Callum Hudson-Odoi, Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech and a late strike from Christian Pulisic.

Chelsea has four points after two games in Group E and hosts Rennes next Wednesday. Krasnodar, which visits Sevilla next, has one.

PSG’s Moise Kean scored twice and Kylian Mbappe grabbed two assists as it overcame a sluggish start to beat Turkish side Istanbul Basaksehir 2-0 away, securing its first win in this season’s group stage.

PSG suffered an injury blow, however, as Brazil forward Neymar was forced off in the 26th minute due to a thigh problem and was replaced by Pablo Sarabia.

The results: Group E: Krasnodar 0 lost to Chelsea 4 (Hudson-Odoi 37, Werner 76-pen, Ziyech 79, Pulisic 90); Sevilla 1 (De Jong 55) drew with Rennes 0.

Group F: Club Brugge 1 (Vanaken 42-pen) drew with Lazio 1 (Correa 14); Borussia Dortmund 2 (Sancho 78-pen, Haaland 90+1) bt Zenit St. Petersburg 0.

Group G: Ferencvaros 2 (Nguen 59, Boli 90) drew with Dynamo Kiev 2 (Tsygankov 28-pen, De Pena 41); Juventus 0 lost to Barcelona 2 (Dembele 14, Messi 90-pen).

Group H: Istanbul Basaksehir 0 lost to Paris St.-Germain 2 (Kean 64, 79); Manchester United 5 (Greenwood 21, Rashford 74, 78, 90+2, Martial 87-pen) bt RB Leipzig 0.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/20g7fm/article32975507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30LEO,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/champions-league-barcelona-eases-past-juventus/article32975508.ece

Substitute Marcus Rashford scored a quickfire hat-trick for Manchester United as they overwhelmed Germany's RB Leipzig 5-0 at Old Trafford in Champions League group H on Wednesday.

United, who started with Paul Pogba in the side and Rashford and Bruno Fernandes on the bench, took the lead in the 21st minute through Mason Greenwood, who delivered a clinical finish after being slipped through by Pogba.

Rashford came on for Greenwood in the 63rd minute and soon set about deciding the match, after the Germans had looked capable of causing United problems.

The England striker raced on to a long ball from Fernandes to make it 2-0 in the 74th minute, with the initial offside call being overturned on review.

Rashford made it 3-0 after Fred robbed Marcel Sabitzer and Anthony Martial added the fourth from the penalty spot.

Chelsea kickstarted their Champions League group campaign by coasting to a 4-0 win at Krasnodar on Wednesday thanks to goals from Callum Hudson-Odoi, Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech and a late strike from Christian Pulisic.

Having drawn their opening game with Sevilla 0-0, Chelsea got off to a slow start against a conservative Krasnodar and passed up a glorious chance to take the lead when Jorginho hit the post from the penalty spot.

Frank Lampard's side went ahead in the 37th minute with a stroke of fortune when Hudson-Odoi's tame shot squirmed through the hands of Krasnodar keeper Matvey Safonov.

Krasnodar nearly equalised when Yuri Gazinskiy hit the crossbar in the second half but Chelsea extended their lead when Werner smashed home from the penalty spot in the 76th minute, after Jorginho had been substituted.

Ziyech grabbed his first goal for Chelsea since switching from Ajax Amsterdam by firing low into the net and Pulisic completed the rout in added time, helped by another lapse of concentration from Safonov.

Assistant Engineer Thennarasu (45) of Kallanai Canal Division had allegedly demanded ₹5,000 as bribe for recommending an application of a farmer Prabhakaran for a No Objection Certificate to sink a borewell in his land near the canal. DVAC sources said Prabhakaran had approached the Tangedco seeking power supply under the tatkal scheme to sink the borewell in his land. He was advised to obtain a No Objection Certificate from the Public Works Department since the land was close to the canal. Accordingly, Prabhakaran approached the Assistant Engineer who allegedly demanded bribe for recommending his application to the higher ups, the sources further said.

Unwilling to pay bribe, Prabhakaran lodged a complaint with the DVAC here and a case was registered. A trap was laid and the Assistant Engineer was allegedly caught red-handed when he obtained the bribe amount in his office at Nakudi.

456,2020/10/29,"Chased by police, gang abandons abducted boy","Kidnappers had reportedly demanded a hefty amount as ransom

Tiruchi

A car-borne gang which allegedly kidnapped a 12-year-old boy here on Wednesday evening abandoned the minor and the vehicle hours later and escaped after sensing police teams were in hot pursuit.

The minor was playing with his bicycle in front of his house situated in the Cantonment area when the gang which came in a car allegedly abducted the boy. Police sources said the kidnappers reportedly made a call to the boy's family members demanding a hefty amount as ransom.

Acting swiftly based on information provided by the minor boy’s family about the kidnap, the police sounded an alert to all check posts falling within its jurisdiction besides constituting special teams to apprehend the kidnappers and rescue the boy. Information about the kidnap was also flashed to police personnel of neighbouring districts such as Pudukottai, Dindigul and Karur, Commissioner of Police J. Loganathan said.

The police teams immediately got into the task of sifting video grabs generated from the surveillance cameras installed in the locality where the boy was kidnapped. The teams ascertained the colour of the vehicle used for the crime and its model from the video grabs. Information about the colour of the vehicle was flashed to all the check posts.

A policeman noticed a car of the same colour in Somarasampet area a few hours later and the vehicle was proceeding towards Tiruchi. He immediately alerted his counterparts deployed at the checkpost along the Vayalur road. Acting on the information, the police personnel tried to stop the car at the checkpost. However, the vehicle sped away prompting the police to sound an alert. Patrol vehicles began to chase the car which went into the Ramalinga Nagar area.

Sensing that they could be intercepted by the police, the gang members abandoned the vehicle and the boy and took to their heels. The boy was rescued and the vehicle used for the crime was confiscated. Commissioner of Police Loganathan said the registration number of the seized vehicle was found to be fake. Based on the engine and chassis number, the police teams managed to get hold of the original registration number and the owner of the car. Mr. Loganathan said the vehicle owner had been traced. Further investigation was on to apprehend the culprits and establish the motive behind the kidnap, he added. The Cantonment Police has registered a case under IPC section 364-A (kidnapping for ransom).",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/chased-by-police-gang-abandons-abducted-boy/article32974319.ece
457,2020/10/29,"Shallot prices soar, touch ₹135 a kg in retail market","The rise continues despite State Government’s price-stabilisation exercise

Despite the State Government’s intervention for price regulation, the cost of onion has been soaring in Tiruchi market.

The price of top quality shallots, which was being sold for ₹ 100 a kg in the second week of October, was sold for ₹135 in the retail market on Thursday. One bag of shallots (50 kg) was being sold at ₹5,300 at the wholesale market in Tiruchi. One kg of shallot was quoted at ₹106 in the wholesale market.

The prices of big onion too did not show signs of a downward trend. One bag of big onion weighing 50 kg, was sold for ₹3,700. The price of one kg big onion was being quoted at ₹74 in the wholesale market on Thursday and it was being sold between ₹ 90 and ₹100 in the retail market.

The soaring prices suggested that the price stabilisation exercise by the State government to sell onion at ₹45 in the farm fresh outlets have not impacted the market prices.

The onion wholesale traders in Tiruchi, who source both the big and small varieties of onions from Perambalur, and Karnataka, supply them to traders in Thanjavur, Kumbakonam, Pudukottai, and Tiruvarur district. The wholesale market in Tiruchi requires 30 loads of big onion (10 tonne each) to meet the requirement of retail markets in Tiruchi and other delta districts. But, the arrival dwindled drastically. The wholesale market receives about 10 loads of big onion for the last few weeks from Karnataka and Maharashtra. Similarly, as against the requirement of 250 tonnes of shallots, the market received just 75 tonnes of shallots a day for the last two weeks.

“There is a clear mismatch between supply and demand. The arrival continues to decline. It has eventually caused escalation in prices of onions,” says P. Sudhakar, a wholesale onion trader in Tiruchi.

A Kumbakonam-based company has launched an app-based delivery service of essentials in the city. Named ‘Delibots’, the service aims to purchase, pick up and drop any essentials for the customer.

Announcing its launch in the city, A. Muhammed Mukarak, Director, Delibots, said on Thursday that the sole aim was to bring such services to Tier II and Tier III cities in Tamil Nadu. “Why must only the tier I cities enjoy these services? We have needs and requirements too, and with a service like Delibots, we seek to bridge the gap,” he said.

The service will cover a 20-km radius around the city and has milk and dairy delivery, fruits and vegetables, delivery from restaurants, meat and seafood shops, groceries, medicines, and even pet supplies. A bike-pool option has also been launched for a single-person pickup and drop facility.

The app was launched in Tiruchi by V. Govindarajulu, State Secretary, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangangalin Peramaippu and A. Zameer Pasha, former governor, Rotary International District 3000.

Mr. Govindarajulu said that services like Delibots would help small vendors to reach consumers. “We will be happy to hand over our ware to them if they are able to deliver it directly to the consumer,” he said.

Dr. Pasha said that the service is necessary to encourage people to stay at home. “People venture out to purchase essentials most of the time. With a service that reaches their doorsteps, social distancing can be maintained well,” he said.

461,2020/10/29,When mourning never ends,"Memories of borewell tragedy linger in Nadukattupatti

Nadukattupatti, the village in Manapparai block where a two-year-old boy fell in a borewell hole and died seems untouched by time. The fields are lush and rows of maize are ready for harvest. Amid the green lies a small area of grey- encased in concrete, where there used to be a borewell, into which two-year-old Sujith Wilson fell on October 25, 2019 and later died.

“My son has not left us. He is with me in spirit and I feel him here often. Since he died, I have rarely left the house as I do not want to leave him here alone,” said Kala Mary, Sujith's mother. In between sobs, Ms. Mary said that the five days when they fought to save her son were the worst part of her life. “I do not wish it upon my worst enemies. My son yearned for me and I was not able to reach him.”

Sujith's older brother Punith Roshan, who is now old enough to go to first standard, believes that his brother lives under the concrete, said Ms. Mary. “If anyone visits our home, he first takes them to the concrete spot and shows it to them. He did not ask us any questions about where his baby brother went. He has lost his playmate and now usually spends time on his own,” she wept.

Despite an 80-hour-long battle and at least 15 different equipment applied in an attempt to rescue the boy, he died and his body was removed from the well on October 29, 2019, around 2.30 am. The borewell in Nadukattupatti was too small, and the child’s head was only as big as the opening, said M. Manikandan, a Madurai-based teacher who invented a ‘borewell robot,’ which was also employed to rescue the boy. The apparatus has oxygen supply, light, a high-resolution camera and arms to hold and carry the child. “The rocks too were slippery. Every time we touched the child, he would slip further down. It was difficult to hold him in place and try and rescue him,” he said.

Vehicles passing by the narrow road in front of Sujith's house slow down to take a look at the spot. “While some pray for him and for us, many see at it and remember our terrible ordeal,” Ms. Mary said.

Sujith's family received money from friends, wellwishers and political parties, but not a rupee has been touched, said Britto Arockiyaraj, his father. “I earn ₹500 a day as construction worker. For now, that is enough for my family. The money will help my son in the future,” he said.

Changes in TNFRS

Since the incident last year, the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services department has attempted to fabricate machines to handle borewell-related accidents. A team of advisers, including researchers from Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, and Mr. Manikandan were consulted and an order has been placed for 20 such machines. A special training programme was held for all TNFRS personnel across the State on initial handling of such situations, C. Sylendra Babu, Director, Fire And Rescue Services, said.

All fire stations have now delegated a technical station officer to keep a check on open borewells in the region, and to report it to the district administration immediately, he added.

First anniversary

The family has organised a prayer and a lunch in Sujith’s memory on October 29. “Anybody and everybody who prayed for our boy is invited. He is also the son of whoever prayed for him and in his honour, we would like to serve whoever wishes to come,” Ms. Mary said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/ocej28/article32969055.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY29-SUJITH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/when-mourning-never-ends/article32969056.ece

With the decrease in coronavirus cases since September, the district administration has denotified several A category hospitals, which were treating only COVID-19 patients, as B category hospitals.

These hospital managements are given permission to treat regular patients along with the coronavirus patients in separate blocks. The step was taken to ensure that people with other health issues receive proper medicare.

Hospitals treating COVID-19 patients are getting a slight relief with the decrease in cases since the last couple of weeks in the district. Even the Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS), the designated State COVID-19 hospital, is witnessing several empty beds.

Since the last couple of months, the coronavirus cases have been gradually declining in the district. July saw 10,277 cases and 86 deaths. In August, the total number of cases reported in the district was 25,929 and 167 persons died due to the virus.

468,2020/10/29,Data | How past polls guided the seat sharing strategy between BJP and JD(U) in Bihar elections,"The BJP won more than 45% of the urban votes it contested in the 2015 Assembly election, at least 7% points higher than its contested vote share in all other areas. On the other hand, in 2015, JD(U) won only 37.7% of the urban votes it contested

In the Bihar Assembly elections, the NDA has chosen to field candidates from the BJP in more than 80% of the urban seats. In contrast, in rural areas, the JD(U) has the upper hand. The BJP’s strong show in the urban seats in the recent polls, where the JD(U) is relatively weaker, may have influenced such a seat-sharing pact. In contrast, both the RJD and the Congress have maintained similar vote shares across the rural-urban divide in the recent polls. And so, for the 2020 polls, the RJD’s and the Congress’ candidates are equally spread among all the areas.

NDA's rural-urban divide

The BJP won more than 45% of the urban votes it contested in the 2015 Assembly election, at least 7% points higher than its contested vote share in all other areas. On the other hand, in 2015, JD(U) won only 37.7% of the urban votes it contested. Notably, after joining the NDA for the 2019 LS elections, the JD(U)’s urban performance dramatically improved. The table lists contested vote share (a party’s votes divided by total votes polled in seats contested by the party).

No clear divide

There is no significant rural-urban skew for the Grand alliance parties in the ‘grand alliance.’ In 2015, when the alliance won [JD(U) was part of it in 2015], support was drawn equally from all the areas. When they lost in 2019, support was withdrawn equally from all areas. The table lists contested vote shares across rural-urban areas.

469,2020/10/29,Data | A record number of mail votes may get rejected in U.S. presidential polls 2020,"Democrats may be disproportionately affected by ballot rejections

More than 70 million American citizens have already cast their ballot as “early voters” in the 2020 U.S. presidential polls with less than a week left for election day.

A significant share of early votes was cast through mail, a method which results in significantly more ballot rejections than the traditional in-person voting. Close to 2% of mail votes were rejected in this year’s primary elections. If a similar share of mail votes gets rejected in the 2020 presidential polls, about a million votes may go uncounted, given the increased early voting due to the pandemic.

Also, this may disproportionately affect the Democrats more than the Republicans as data show that a significantly higher number of voters affiliated to the Democratic Party request postal ballots compared to the Republican Party.

Studies also show that ballots of Black and younger voters, who form an important part of the Democratic support base, have a higher probability of getting rejected than other types.

Early bird

Around 71.1 million Americans voted early this year, surpassing the previous record of 57.5 million set in 2016. More than 50% of 2016’s total votes have already been cast as early votes this year, of which 34.4% were sent through mail.

Chart appears incomplete? Click to remove AMP mode

Rejected ratio

Close to 1% and 2.1% of mail votes were rejected in the 2016 election and 2020 presidential primaries, respectively. If a similar or a slightly higher % of mail votes get rejected in the 2020 polls, 0.5 to 1.5 million votes may go uncounted.

Mostly Democrats

Some U.S. States maintain party affiliation data of voters who request for postal ballot. In 2020, close to 25 million (mn) such voters were affiliated with the Democratic Party, compared to the 14.7 million affiliated with the Republican Party.

Calculating impact

The uncounted votes aren’t insignificant as the small margins of victory for Donald Trump in 2016 in swing States show.

470,2020/10/29,Agri-tech company aims at growing a new ethos in farming,"FarmPal Technologi has made agriculture beneficial to growers and consumers during lockdown

Growing up in a farming family in Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra, Karan Hon has personally experienced the travails of Indian agriculture. “There was a lot of poverty in my village, because farmers used expensive traditional practices for cultivation, but never got the right price for their crop. There was no transparency in the wholesale market’s pricing. I found that disappointing,” says Hon over phone.

So in 2017, Hon, who graduated in Mechanical Engineering, decided to quit his 20-year career in leading corporate companies and co-founded FarmPal Technologi in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Maharashtra, with Puneet Sethi and Ganesh Hon. Their aim: making agriculture beneficial for both farmer and consumer.

Supplying fruits and vegetables to Pune and Mumbai, besides supermarkets in Karnataka, FarmPal wants to bring a more level playing field for growers, sellers and consumers.

“In the traditional market and supply chain model, middlemen are taking away all the benefits. Farmers don’t get even one-third of what the consumer is actually paying for the produce. This is where agri-tech startups can help,” he says.

Payments are made electronically to the farmer, ensuring financial security. FarmPal used the lockdown to create employment opportunities as well. “When our regular employees got stranded in their hometowns, we found a solution by asking construction workers nearby to join us as helpers for sorting, grading and delivery,” Hon says.

The other step was to get the public involved in distribution. “We reached out to apartments and building societies, and formed partnerships with residents to collect orders from their building and pass them on to us. We make a contact-less dispatch to the tenant partner, who would then be responsible for last-mile delivery,” he says.

With no investment required by the distributors, this model has helped partners, mostly homemakers, senior citizens and the newly unemployed during lockdown, earn ₹20,000 to ₹25,000 in shared revenue with FarmPal. Over 1,000 families in Pune have been covered by the project, which is being also tested in Mumbai.

Even before the lockdown, agri-tech companies had begun streamlining fresh produce procurement and sales in the country.

According to a 2019 NASSCOM report, India has more than 450 agri-tech start-ups growing at a rate of 25% annually. These companies have boomed during the lockdown as they have been able to quickly step into the breach created by the dismantling of the traditional market-supply chain.

FarmPal’s business has grown at 50% year-on-year, with a network of over 2,000 farmers and produce sourced from western Maharashtra and central Madhya Pradesh.

“We had some problems soon after the lockdown’s announcement in March, but eventually, since we already had the technology, we were able to deal with the disruption. We called up the farmers and reassured them that we would take their produce to the consumer even though the markets were closed,” says Hon.

Besides fulfilling orders in Pune and Mumbai, FarmPal also managed to export fresh produce to West Asian countries during critical periods of the lockdown. “Before COVID, we used to sell 15 to 20 tonnes of fruits and vegetables daily. In the early stages of lockdown, it dropped to 10-12 tonnes. Now we are returning to our earlier range,” says Hon.

Changing ethos

Hon says the pandemic has brought about a sea change in the attitudes of both growers and consumers. “Consumers are now accustomed to expecting high levels of hygiene and nutrition in their food. This means that the amount of chemical fertilisers and pesticides used in agriculture should be controlled,” he says.

Technology will help track the life cycle of crops, from planting to harvest, hopefully making it easier to gauge its safety, says Hon. “We are working on collecting the data and explaining it to the consumer. The pandemic has taught us that we have to change the way we eat.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/25ex5/article32972783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Co-Founder-Karan-Hon-At-the-Farm,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/maharashtra-startup-makes-agriculture-beneficial-for-both-farmer-and-consumer/article32972784.ece
471,2020/10/29,Coral reef taller than Eiffel Tower found in Australia,"It was the first detached reef of that size to be discovered in over 120 years and that it was thriving with a “blizzard of fish” in a healthy ecosystem

Australian scientists found a detached coral reef on the Great Barrier Reef that exceeds the height of the Empire State Building and the Eiffel Tower, the Schmidt Ocean Institute said this week, the first such discovery in over 100 years. The “blade like” reef is nearly 500 metres tall and 1.5 kilometres wide, said the institute.

It lies 40 metres below the ocean surface and about six kilometres from the edge of Great Barrier Reef.

A team of scientists from James Cook University, led by Dr. Robin Beaman, were mapping the northern seafloor of the Great Barrier Reef on board the institutes research vessel Falkor, when they found the reef on October 20. “We are surprised and elated by what we have found,” said Beaman.

He said it was the first detached reef of that size to be discovered in over 120 years and that it was thriving with a “blizzard of fish” in a healthy ecosystem.

The discovery comes after a study earlier this month found the Great Barrier Reef had lost more than half its coral in the last three decades.

Using the underwater robot known as SuBastian, the scientists filmed their exploration of the new reef, collecting marine samples on the way, which will be archived and placed in the Queensland Museum and the Museum of Tropical Queensland.

“To not only 3D map the reef in detail, but also visually see this discovery with SuBastian is incredible,” Beaman added.

Although the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef suffered from bleaching in 2016, Beaman said this detached reef didn't display any evidence of damage.

472,2020/10/29,"Now, take a sip using straws made of fallen coconut leaves","They last for hours in a drink, are compostable, and come in different sizes for bubble tea and coconut water. Straws made of fallen coconut leaves are making steady inroads into domestic and global markets

October 3, 2017 was a special day for Professor Saji Varghese, who teaches English, Design Thinking, Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship at Christ University in Bengaluru. As he walked around his campus, he noticed a few fallen coconut leaves. What struck him was a unique curl to the withered leaf, almost resembling a drinking straw. That eureka moment led to three years of research and design, and birthed Sunbird Straws, the first multi-layered coconut straws to hit the market.

“We sent samples of these straws to 10 countries during the last one year and now have potential orders of 25 million straws. We have one operational centre in a village near Madurai, employing six women, but are looking to expand to eight centres in three months, employing 121 women across coastal India,” explains Saji.

Meanwhile, at Bengaluru-based startup Evlogia Ecocare. Founder, Manigandan Kumarappan, says proudly, “We started production in January 2019 with three employees producing 150 straws a day. Now we have grown to produce more than 10,000 straws a day with 15 staff members.” Raw materials are organised at centres in Madurai, Palani and Dindigul where women self-help groups are supported by the TVS Arogya Trust and other NGOs. Over 90% of their straws are exported to the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, and Germany.

Grounded in method

Both these startups make it a point to ensure that all their straws are made from fallen — not plucked — coconut leaves.

It is a meticulous, multi-step, mechanised process, supervised by the staff, explains Saji. First, the leaves undergo a three-stage cleaning process. They are then cut according to specific width — regular straws with 4 mm diameter; bubble tea straws 12 mm in diameter and so on. The leaves are scraped and rendered into spools, fed into long, spiral rolling devices to make the multi-layered straws, and then cut into standard and customised lengths. Then, they go through a sterilisation process and are packed for sale.

Adds Saji, “A wax bursting system preserves the natural wax of the straws, rendering them waterproof, and they have a natural outer and inner anti-fungal wall. This enhances shelf life to nine months and they stay steady in beverages for six hours.”

Though these straws are not that common a sight in the market yet, they are raking in laurels already. For both of them, 2020 has been a good year. Sunbird Straws has been selected under the PACE incubator programme, powered by the RKVY-RAFTAAR scheme, of the Ministry of Agriculture and Family Welfare, receiving a grant up to ₹25 lakh. It has also been chosen for the Shine programme by Swiss Re for 2020, which entails a six-month mentoring programme and a non- equity grant of ₹15 lakh. Evlogia emerged winner at the Circular Innovation Jam 2020 and won plaudits for Best Business plan at the Big Leap 2020 event as well.

Receiver’s end

Evlogia is partnering with a Noida-based business to provide leafy straws to coconut vendors, making the thirst-quenching experience an environmentally-responsible one as well. In Bengaluru, zero-waste juice shop Eat Raja offers most of its juices in fruit cups, with no straws. But founder Anand Raj says Evlogia’s leafy straws won him over. “A friend supplies these single-layer coconut straws that most of our patrons love. They are good for tender coconuts and great for the planet.”

Neena Gupta, founder of Karmic Seed, an online distributor of sustainable tableware, is happy that she found Sunbird Straws, “I fell in love with these straws when I first used them. They are durable and don’t get soggy like paper straws. The fact that they are made from agri-waste makes me happy, since valuable resources are not being over utilised.” Saji has also secured orders from five-star hotels within India and beverage chains with operations overseas. The next stop is retail, across e-commerce websites.

To Saji, the most important contribution of Sunbird Straws is the intersection of sustainability and rural development, “Using agri-waste, we prevent combustion of these dry leaves, that release harmful gases into the air, and once used, the straws are compostable. We employ people who live off the land, and impart technological and operational training, while incorporating soft skills, financial literacy, and engaging the employees in programmes of physical, mental and emotional well being, through interventions from experts and interns from relevant departments of Christ University.”

For Evlogia, the next stop is production of airtight take-away boxes fashioned out of areca sheets, and banana fibre cups, all with the two-pronged focus of replacing plastic and supporting the rural economy.

473,2020/10/29,New coral species discovered on seabed marked for deep-sea mining,"Previous studies have found a black coral species more than 4,250 years old, Conservation International said

Three species of black coral have been discovered on the seabed of the northern Pacific Ocean, an area where several countries have contracts to explore for metals including cobalt and nickel as they race to find new supplies of the key battery elements.

The corals were discovered on deep seamounts and ridges in the mineral-rich Prime Crust Zone, which stretches from the Mariana Trench to the Hawaiian islands, according to a paper published in scientific journal Zootaxa on Thursday.

The new black coral species are so named because of their black skeletons, but they can appear pink, white, or various other colours because of the living tissues growing over the skeleton. Previous studies have found a black coral species more than 4,250 years old, Conservation International said.

Authors Dennis Opresko of the Smithsonian Institute and Daniel Wagner of Conservation International said they aimed to identify deep-sea habitats in the zone which holds the highest concentrations on Earth of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts.

“These long-living corals are much like the redwoods of the ocean. They're not only slow-growing and long-lived, but also provide important habitat for many other species,” Wagner said. “Mining their habitat could potentially wipe them out before we know their true value.”

‘Deep-sea mining could destroy as yet undiscovered species’

China, Japan, Russia, and South Korea all hold exploration contracts in the Prime Crust Zone, according to the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a U.N. body in charge of regulating the ocean floors. Environmentalists have called for a ban on deep-sea mining which would extract prized resources including cobalt, copper, nickel, and manganese from seabed nodules and crusts. Deep-sea mining could destroy as yet undiscovered species, the Ocean Panel said in June. Only around 20% of the ocean floor has been mapped to date, according to Conservation International.

The Jamaica-headquartered ISA has drawn up regulations on exploration but has yet to establish the rules for exploitation needed for deep-sea mining to go ahead. An in-person ISA assembly was postponed from July due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and would now “most likely” take place in early December, according to the ISA website.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/1r28qx/article32970415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/new-coral-species-discovered-on-seabed-marked-for-deep-sea-mining/article32970416.ece
474,2020/10/29,Give a thought for your pennies this World Thrift Day,"World Thrift Day is observed on October 31, though in India it is celebrated the day before. We find out how some have been balancing the books since the pandemic, which has redefined spending and savings for many

For Chetan Dube and family from Delhi, weekends meant catching the latest Bollywood release at the multiplex and a lavish dinner to their heart’s content from their favourite restaurant. “This used to be a routine of sorts. After a week’s work, it was the time to blow up some money and unwind,” he says. Then came the lockdown. “Initially, it felt liking upsetting the apple cart but in a few weeks, I realised I was able to save a lot more money as our lifestyle turned around,” he adds.

Chetan has since resolved to “invest creatively” that extra savings. His new-found love is indoor gardening, something his two young kids too have taken a liking for. “After all, isn’t a pleasant home décor way more satisfying than fast food?” he asks.

With the pandemic clipping our wings, our spending and savings patterns have changed. While some embrace the idea of “cashing in on” the restricted times to save up for the future, others look to invest smartly to make the best out of the unexpected gain. As World Thrift Day is observed on October 31 to highlight the importance of savings, we find out how some have been balancing the books since the lockdown. In India, World Savings Day is however celebrated on October 30 as the following day coincides with the death anniversary of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

There are no outings or mall shopping now for Maris Urumeese from Mangalore. “Since March, I have spent zero money on new clothes. Earlier, eating out or having takeaways were frequent but since the pandemic struck, me and my husband, Robin Jose, began to experiment more with cooking at home,” says Maris, a dental college lecturer. She does not mind shelling out a bit extra on some fancy veggie or an exotic fruit from the supermarket since their monthly expenses have come down. “I have also opened a recurring deposit for better returns from the additional savings I make,” she adds.

Kitchen is where the heart is for Shuvaranjan Sinhababu from Kolkata as well. “Since the lockdown, we have been spending more on purchasing a variety of fishes. Ordinarily, we used to stick to some of the common or cheaper fish varieties, but these days we are fork out more on food but made at home since we have automatically cut down a lot on other expenses,” he says. However, he calls for the need to tighten the belt for a “nest egg” during the pandemic. “There’s also the anxiety in the back of one’s mind about having to save for any potential medical expenses in these times. Recently, I heard about a family that ran up debts after treatment for Covid,” he adds.

The pandemic has not been kind to some whose livelihood took a beating from its consequences. Like A L Senthil Kumar from Chennai who runs a graphic design studio. Anticipating a slump in business, he made other plans with smart money, investing in online gold trading. “You may call this side business but it has certainly helped me through. Since the lockdown, most of my savings have been in the form of gold,” he says.

Senthil says he keeps himself updated on the market trends thanks to investment apps. “There is of course a potential risk but you are aware of the market behaviour and invest judiciously, you can reap dividends,” he says. After a rather “quiet” few months, he is gearing up for some grand online shopping for Deepavali.

Arushi Joshi, who works with an HR firm in Mumbai, seconds the idea of online trading. A commerce graduate, she says she reasonably understands mark trends and this knowledge came in handy in the past few months when she started investing in mutual funds. “What helped me is that I did not really need a large capital, unlike in the case of fixed deposit, to try my hand at mutual funds. The additional savings sufficed,” she says.

With modes of entertainment shifting indoors during the pandemic, some find their own way of keeping themselves amused at home. Like software engineer Padmanabhan H from Thiruvananthapuram who has taken to playing fantasy sports via Dream11 this IPL season. It is fun for sure and, if lady luck favours, actually rewarding as well, he says. “As I do WFH, I get to save a lot of time otherwise spend travelling and fuel expenses that I invest in playing fantasy sports now. I cannot go out in the evenings any way and as a cricket buff, this keeps me engaged. So, heads or tails, it’s win-win for me,” he says with a laugh.

475,2020/10/29,The Hindu newsletter,"Welcome to this week’s The Hindu Data newsletter, The Scatter Plot. Every week, we shall feature the stories published in The Hindu using in-depth data, either simply told with numbers or with extensive data visualisations.

Datapoint on The Hindu’s Oped page is a regular feature published by the Data Team* every day from Monday to Thursday (four per week). Datapoint usually takes an overview of a contemporaneous public issue using the data available for analysing it.

This week, we focused on three issues –

Trends in the upcoming U.S. Presidential elections , & who is doing better among Indian Americans

, & who is doing better among Fuel prices and how do Indians compare with citizens of other nations in terms of who are paying the most at the fuel pump

A) Polls to the U.S. Presidential elections conclude on November 4 and with barely ten days to go, the Democratic nominee and former vice president Joe Biden seems to have the edge, according to various opinion polls. The Hindu looked at an aggregate of opinion polls in the U.S. as of October 17 to show this in the lead-up to the elections. A weighted average of opinion polls as of that date showed Mr. Biden having a 10.7 percentage point lead over President Donald Trump, a number that has narrowed slightly to 9.1 points as of October 25, but is still considered healthy for the former.

The support for Mr Biden is even more pronounced among the Indian American (U.S. Citizens of Indian origin) community. On key questions – who they intended to vote for, net approval, Mr Biden scored much better than Mr Trump among the respondents in a survey titled, “The 2020 Indian American Attitudes Survey”.

Cultural reasons – intolerance towards minorities and the influence of Christian evangelicalism in particular– were offered as the key reasons for the opposition to the Republican Party even as the Democrat Party was chosen by 39% of the respondents (over less than 20% for the GOP) as doing a better job of handling U.S.- India relations.

B) One of the major impact of the COVID-19 pandemic the world over has been reduction in global crude prices. This has however not resulted in lowered retail prices – petrol, diesel, etc for the Indian consumer as the government has continued to increase the excise component of the overall prices to garner more revenue from retail consumption of the fuel. The price of crude oil in October is 42% lower than what it was at the start of FY21, while the price of petrol increased by 12% in the same period.

Petrol prices between April and June 2020 increased only in eight countries (including India) among 59 for whom prices were studied and consumers from only India and Pakistan (~17% of day’s income) spent more than 10% of their daily income on fuel (on an average).

There is some good news for India’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic – the virus’ spread had peaked by mid-September and daily cases and deaths were on a decline in the past month or so. While the U.S., India and Brazil continued to account for more than half the cases in the world, cases were on a steady decline in India and on a downward trend in Brazil. The U.S., on the other hand is undergoing yet another increase in cases heading towards a third peak.

Elections in Bolivia returned the Movimiento el Socialismo (MAS) to power again, nearly a year after MAS leader and former president Evo Morales resigned, alleging a coup. Interestingly Bolivia, a lowly developed Latin American country with vast mineral resources and a diverse demography, had witnessed 23 coup attempts between 1950 and 2019, the highest in the world for that period.

476,2020/10/29,Strong antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in most people: study,"According to the researchers, a moderate level of antibody is retained by most people five months after symptom-onset.

A vast majority of individuals infected with mild-to-moderate COVID 19 mount a “robust” defence via antibodies that is relatively stable for “at least five months”, according to a new study which says this immune response significantly reduces the risk of re-infection with the novel coronavirus.

The research, published in the journal Science, found that this antibody response correlates with the body’s ability to neutralise the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.

“While some reports have come out saying antibodies to this virus go away quickly, we have found just the opposite — that more than 90% of people who were mildly or moderately ill produce an antibody response strong enough to neutralise the virus, and the response is maintained for many months,” said Florian Krammer, a senior author of the study from The Mount Sinai Hospital in the U.S.

“Uncovering the robustness of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, including its longevity and neutralising effects, is critically important to enabling us to effectively monitor seroprevalence in communities and to determining the duration and levels of antibody that protect us from reinfection,” Krammer said.

To screen individuals, the scientists used an antibody test called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the virus’ telltale spike protein which enables it to attach and gain entry into our cells.

Based on the findings, the scientists said a vast majority of positive individuals had moderate-to-high levels of antibodies that can neutralise the coronavirus spike protein.

The scientists then recalled 121 recovered COVID-19 patients for repeat antibody testing at approximately three and five months post-symptom onset. They saw a slight drop in the antibody levels in these individuals from the first to second testing time point, and another drop for the last testing time point.

According to the researchers, this indicated that a moderate level of antibody is retained by most people five months after symptom-onset.

“The serum antibody titre we measured in individuals initially were likely produced by plasmablasts — cells that act as first responders to an invading virus and come together to produce initial bouts of antibodies whose strength soon wanes,” said Ania Wajnberg, another co-author of the study. “The sustained antibody levels that we subsequently observed are likely produced by long-lived plasma cells in the bone marrow. This is similar to what we see in other viruses and likely means they are here to stay.”

According to the scientists, the vast majority of individuals with antibody titres of 320 or higher showed neutralising activity in their serum that are stable over a period of at least three months with only modest declines at the five-month time point. Although this cannot provide conclusive evidence that these antibody responses protect from re-infection, the researchers believe the antibodies could decrease the odds of getting reinfected, and may attenuate disease in the case of breakthrough infection.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/gv6gah/article32970628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSAUSTRIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/strong-antibody-response-to-sars-cov-2-in-most-people-study/article32970629.ece
477,2020/10/29,Miniature organs help test potential coronavirus drugs,"The team developed organoids containing types of lung and colon cells that are known to become infected in people with COVID-19.

Tiny organ-like structures grown in the laboratory to behave like human lungs and colons can be used to rapidly screen drugs and identify those with potential as COVID-19 treatments, researchers reported on Wednesday in Nature.

Compared with traditional pre-clinical approaches, in which drugs are tested in cells from monkeys or from human cancer patients, these so-called organoids more faithfully mimic the complex cell types and structure of human tissues, according to Dr. Shuibing Chen and Dr. Robert Schwartz of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.

Their team developed organoids containing types of lung and colon cells that are known to become infected in people with COVID-19.

“This study demonstrates that you can use organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells as a platform to discover drugs that block SARS-CoV-2 infection or progression of COVID-19,” said co-senior author Dr. Todd Evans, the Peter I. Pressman M.D. Professor of Surgery and associate dean for research at Weill Cornell Medicine. “Also, this platform can screen drugs that are already FDA-approved, which provides the added advantage of possibly being able to repurpose drugs that we already know are safe in patients, and therefore have the potential to move quickly into clinical trials.”

In collaboration with teams at Columbia University and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, they screened 1,200 FDA-approved drugs and found three that showed activity against the novel coronavirus, including the cancer drug imatinib, sold as Gleevec by Novartis.

“We also showed that we can transplant these human organoids into a mouse, giving us a model to evaluate the efficacy of different compounds in human cells in a whole animal context,” Dr. Chen said. She adds that, to her knowledge, this is the first time organoids have been used as part of a high-throughput screening platform for any purpose on a broad scale.

It is currently being tested in four different COVID-19 clinical trials.

Dr. Schwartz added that because organoids can be made for every human organ type, this screening method could help to identify drugs that treat numerous harmful effects of COVID-19 disease. “If in fact we find the same drugs keep coming up, that’s a hopeful sign that they could be effective for treating systemic infections,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7p8o4i/article32868759.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKVIRUSOUTBREAKHUNGARY,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/miniature-organs-help-test-potential-coronavirus-drugs/article32970232.ece
