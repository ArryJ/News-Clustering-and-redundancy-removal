0,2020/10/16,Wimbledon set to return in 2021,"Wimbledon is set to go ahead next year even if the Grand Slam tournament has to be staged behind closed doors, organisers announced on Friday.

The grasscourt championships were cancelled this year for the first time since World War II because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The All England Club is planning for several scenarios in 2021 — a full-capacity Wimbledon, reduced numbers of fans or holding the tournament with no spectators present.

“Staging the championships in 2021 is our number-one priority and we are actively engaged in scenario-planning in order to deliver on that priority,” said chief executive Sally Bolton.

Wimbledon’s statement read: “Our overriding priority will continue to be the health and safety of all of our stakeholders, in particular our guests, our staff, and our competitors.

“We are working closely with relevant government and public health authorities, alongside the rest of the sports industry, to understand the varying challenges and opportunities presented by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.”

The Wimbledon tennis tournament is planning its comeback in 2021.

Wimbledon was the only Grand Slam tournament cancelled this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, but the All England Club announced plans on Friday for its return next year.

Staging The Championships in 2021 is our number one priority and we are actively engaged in scenario planning in order to deliver on that priority, All England Club chief executive Sally Bolton said.

The tournament, cancelled this year for the first time since 1945, is scheduled to run next year from June 28-July 11. It could be held at full capacity, reduced capacity or without fans, the club said.

All of the options are dependent on the status of government and public health guidelines, the club said.

The U.S. Open and French Open were held this year but with strict protocols to reduce the possibility of spreading the virus. No fans were allowed at Flushing Meadows, while Roland Garros was limited to 1,000 fans per day.

Our overriding priority will continue to be the health and safety of all of our stakeholders, in particular our guests, our staff, and our competitors, the All England Club said.

We are working closely with the relevant government and public health authorities, alongside the rest of the sports industry, to understand the varying challenges and opportunities presented by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The Australian Open was held this year before the coronavirus pandemic spread around the world, but the 2021 tournament could be affected. Next year’s tournament at Melbourne Park is scheduled to run from January 18-31.

2,2020/10/16,Google to migrate users from Hangouts to Chat in 2021,"The search giant’s Chat service will be available for free, and integrated within Gmail.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Google will begin migrating Hangouts users to Chat in the first half of 2021. Users’ conversations, contacts and saved history in Hangouts will be moved to Chat.

The search giant’s Chat service will be available for free, and integrated within Gmail. It will also function as a standalone app.

Chat includes features similar to Hangouts such as direct and group messaging. Additionally, it will have ‘send to inbox’, faster search, emoji reactions, and suggested replies options.

“With Chat, you can more easily plan with others on goals and similar interests, share and collaborate on files, and assign tasks to help keep everyone on the same page,” Google said in a blog post.

Chat features the same phishing protections as Gmail, so if a link is sent via Chat, it will be checked against real-time data from Safe Browsing and flagged if it’s found to be malicious, it added.

Google said it has seen more users shift away from using Hangouts to manage their texting and calling needs, so it is doing away with Fi support (Google’s carrier service in the US) in Hangouts. It will move users to Google Messages app on Fi.

The search engine giant will enable its users to make voice calls and check voicemail from Messages for web, manage conversations from Messages across devices, and migrate their existing Hangouts conversations.

Similarly, for Voice users, it will direct Hangout Voice users to the Voice app and remove Voice support in Hangouts early next year.

Additionally, due to new telecommunications regulations in the EU and U.S. beginning in 2021, Google will remove the call phones feature in Hangouts. In November, the company will update the group video calling experience in Hangouts with Meet.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/qniviv/article32873896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Google-hangoutsjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-to-migrate-users-from-hangouts-to-chat-in-2021/article32873819.ece
3,2020/10/16,Find the song by humming it to Google Assistant,"The search giant’s machine learning algorithm helps find potential song matches after the user finishes humming.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Ever experienced that moment when knew the song, but couldn’t say it. Well, Google is adding a new feature that will help you find a song just by humming, whistling or singing a melody.

On Google Assistant, just say: “Hey Google, what’s this song?”, and then hum the tune. Google will help find it in about 10-15 seconds. This feature is currently available in English on iOS, and in more than 20 languages on Android.

The search giant’s machine learning algorithm helps find potential song matches after the user finishes humming.

“Don’t worry, you don’t need perfect pitch to use this feature,” Google said in a blog post.

Based on the tune, it will show the most likely option, and users can select the best match, view any accompanying music videos or listen to the song on music apps.

Apart from this, the California-based company has also updated its search algorithm to refine results for users. The company says that 1 in 10 search queries are misspelt. So, it is introducing a new spelling algorithm that helps understand context of misspelt words to show the right results.

Google has also expanded its use of AI in search. It will now allow users to search within a video. It is using computer and speech recognition to automatically identify key moments in the videos. The technology tags those moments in the video to navigate them like chapters in a book. For instance, finding a step in a recipe video or a home run in highlights reel.

Another new feature is the introduction of various data sources directly to Google Search. Datasets which were previously available as part of Open Data Commons can now be accessed through Google search. If a user asks a question like “how many people work in Chicago,” Google will provide stats in a visual format. It will also give other relevant data points and context—like stats for other cities.

New ways to learn and shop with AR

As part of its SearchOn event, Google announced new ways to use its Lens and augmented reality (AR) features.

Lens allows people to search everything using the camera with an ability to recognise 15 billion things. Additionally, it can translate more than 100 languages and can pronounce sentences out loud. With lens, users can now get step-by-step homework help on math, chemistry, biology and physics problems.

For users who use Google to shop, the company has added a feature that will find the exact or similar items for the image that the user has tapped on, and suggest ways to style it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/cp3hap/article32873590.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/finding-songpng,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/find-the-song-by-humming-it-to-google-assistant/article32873583.ece

U.S technology executive Robert Brockman has been charged in the biggest tax evasion case in U.S. history after fellow billionaire Robert Smith turned against him to avoid prosecution himself, the Justice Department said on Thursday.

Brockman, the 79-year-old chief executive of Ohio-based Reynolds and Reynolds Co, hid $2 billion in income from the Internal Revenue Service over two decades, using a web of off-shore companies in Bermuda and St. Kitts and Nevis, according to an indictment unsealed on Thursday.

Reynolds and Reynolds provides software used by auto dealerships to help manage their business.

The indictment alleges Brockman appointed nominees to manage the off-shore entities for him as a means of hiding his involvement, saying he even went so far as to establish a proprietary encrypted email system and use code words such as ”Permit,” “Red fish” and “Snapper” to communicate.

At a press conference in San Francisco, U.S. Attorney David Anderson said Brockman was also charged in a securities fraud scheme, after he bought and sold debt securities in his own company, “breaking a promise to investors that he would not buy or sell his own company's debt.”

The debt was purchased thanks to inside information Brockman possessed, Anderson added.

He faces seven counts of tax evasion, six counts of failing to file reports disclosing foreign bank accounts, and numerous other counts including wire fraud, money laundering and evidence tampering.

Mr. Brockman has pled not guilty, and we look forward to defending him against these charges,” Brockman's attorney Kathryn Keneally said in an emailed statement.

A spokesman for Smith could not be reached immediately for comment.

Anderson said Smith, who helped secure the charges against Brockman and famously announced at last year's Morehouse College commencement that he would pay off the college debt of 2019 graduates, accepted responsibility for his own crimes in the tax evasion scheme.

Brockman and Smith have a business relationship dating back to the late 1990s, according to documents filed in connection with Smith's non-prosecution agreement.

Brockman, who is referred to as “Individual A,” became an investor in Smith's private equity fund in 2000, first with a $300 million commitment, and later increasing it to $1 billion.

As part of his non-prosecution agreement, Smith admitted to using a nominee trustee and corporate manager to hide his control in four off-shore companies. Some of his untaxed income was used to buy a vacation home in Sonoma, California, and ski properties in the Alps, and to fund charitable causes, Anderson said.

He will pay $139 million in taxes and penalties, and will abandon a $182 protective refund claim and pay interest as part of the deal. ”Although Smith willfully and knowingly violated the law, Smith has accepted responsibility and agreed to provide complete and truthful cooperation,” Anderson said.

Smith founded private equity firm Vista Equity Partners and he is listed by Forbes as being the nation's wealthiest Black investor.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/umhh4z/article32870014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/irs-reutersjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/us-tech-mogul-robert-brockman-charged-in-biggest-us-tax-evasion-scheme/article32869998.ece

Foxconn aims to provide components or services for 10% of the world's electric vehicles (EVs) by between 2025 and 2027, and has been in talks with multiple car manufacturers for future cooperation, Chairman Liu Young-way said on Friday.

The Taiwanese contract manufacturer, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd and a major supplier to Apple Inc , is looking at fresh growth from sectors such as electric vehicles, digital health and robots in a drive to diversify its global investments.

Automaker Fiat Chrysler said in January it planned to set up a joint venture with Foxconn to build electric cars and develop internet-connected vehicles in China.

“We want to push Taiwan's EV industry to the world,” Liu said in Taipei on Friday.

“Hon Hai has to ready our open platform as soon as possible. We need to move fast to grab market share,” he said, referring to Foxconn's pledge to build an “open platform” to make key EV components including battery and car internet services to car makers.

Foxconn, which has said it will not manufacture the cars, will make key components for EVs and work with global major auto makers to reach the 10% goal, Liu added, representing around three million vehicles.

The company has been in talks with multiple automobile manufacturers, he said, but declined to provide details citing ”ongoing talks”.

However, progress in these talks has been “relatively good”, Liu added, and declined to give a revenue target for its new EV business.

Another former HSBC executive is heading to the Facebook-backed Libra cryptocurrency project, joining as chief financial officer of a unit tasked with managing the planned digital currency's payments system.

The Geneva-based Libra Association, which plans to issue and govern the Libra cryptocurrency, said in a statement it has appointed Ian Jenkins as CFO and chief risk officer of Libra Networks.

Jenkins is HSBC's former business finance head and group general manager, the association said. He has also previously worked at Credit Suisse and Santander.

Financial leaders of the world's seven biggest economies said on Tuesday that no stablecoin - a type of cryptocurrency, such as Libra, that is often backed by traditional assets - should begin operation until it was properly regulated.

9,2020/10/16,A tool to measure how people feel online,"The hedonometer reflects a 10% random sampling of over 500 million messages posted to Twitter daily.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Researchers at the University of Vermont have developed a tool, called Hedonometer, to gauge the level of happiness of large populations online in real-time. It measures the online sentiment and mental health situation of people posting content.

The tool uses data from social media to measure how people present themselves to the outside world. At present, it uses Twitter as a source, but will soon expand to other sites as well, Hedonometer's website noted.

The name Hedonometer comes from the term coined in the 1800s, which refers to a psychophysical machine used to register the height of pleasure experienced by an individual. The tool's algorithm is described in a study titled 'Temporal Patterns of Happiness and Information in a Global-Scale Social Network: Hedonometrics and Twitter'.

To quantify the level of happiness, the team merged 5,000 frequently used words from four sources — Google Books, New York Times articles, Music lyrics and Twitter's messages, to produce a list of 10,000 unique words.

Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk service, each of these words was scored on a nine-point scale that ranges from sadness to happiness. The team updates the list to include words as they trend online, it stated. The list is available for download.

The hedonometer currently measures Twitter's API. The stream reflects 10% random sampling of the roughly 500 million messages posted to the service daily. Words in messages are thrown into a large bag containing roughly 200 million words per day. This bag is then assigned a happiness score based on the average happiness score of the words contained within.

The team chose Twitter as a source as it provides a massive pool of real-time data. Its user base also represents a strong social signal. The team is also involved in projects that uses the hedonometer to characterise happiness variations with respect to geography, network topology, demographics, and socio-economic data.

The team puts out graphs to portray public sentiment. For instance, the day of Osama Bin Laden's death has a low score on the scale as the hedonometer captured tweets having negative language like 'death', 'war', and 'terrorist'.

Lately, the protests against police brutality in May scored 5.6 on the hedonometer, making it the saddest day recorded by the tool so far. The tool picked up words like 'anger', 'no', 'violence', 'terrorist', and 'racist' to assign the score.

The team hopes to incorporate other emotions like anger, fear, and surprise into the tool soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/51j1v2/article32869267.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/social-reutersjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/a-tool-to-measure-how-people-feel-online/article32869263.ece
10,2020/10/16,YouTube follows Twitter and Facebook with QAnon crackdown,"YouTube is the third of the major social platforms to announce policies intended rein in QAnon, a conspiracy theory they all helped spread.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

YouTube is following the lead of Twitter and Facebook, saying that it is taking more steps to limit QAnon and other baseless conspiracy theories that can lead to real-world violence.

The Google-owned video platform said on October 15 it will now prohibit material targeting a person or group with conspiracy theories that have been used to justify violence.

One example would be videos that threaten or harass someone by suggesting they are complicit in a conspiracy such as QAnon, which paints President Donald Trump as a secret warrior against a supposed child-trafficking ring run by celebrities and deep state government officials.

Pizzagate is another internet conspiracy theory — essentially a predecessor to QAnon — that would fall in the banned category. Its promoters claimed children were being harmed at a pizza restaurant in Washington. D.C. A man who believed in the conspiracy entered the restaurant in December 2016 and fired an assault rifle. He was sentenced to prison in 2017.

YouTube is the third of the major social platforms to announce policies intended rein in QAnon, a conspiracy theory they all helped spread.

Twitter announced in July a crackdown on QAnon, though it did not ban its supporters from its platform. It did ban thousands of accounts associated with QAnon content and blocked URLs associated with it from being shared. Twitter also said that it would stop highlighting and recommending tweets associated with QAnon.

Facebook, meanwhile, announced last week that it was banning groups that openly support QAnon. It said it would remove pages, groups and Instagram accounts for representing QAnon — even if they don’t promote violence.

The social network said it will consider a variety of factors in deciding whether a group meets its criteria for a ban. Those include the group’s name, its biography or about section, and discussions within the page or group on Facebook, or account on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.

Facebook’s move came two months after it announced softer crackdown, saying said it would stop promoting the group and its adherents. But that effort faltered due to spotty enforcement.

YouTube said it had already removed tens of thousands of QAnon-videos and eliminated hundreds of channels under its existing policies — especially those that explicitly threaten violence or deny the existence of major violent events.

All of this work has been pivotal in curbing the reach of harmful conspiracies, but there’s even more we can do to address certain conspiracy theories that are used to justify real-world violence, like QAnon,” the company said in Thursday’s blog post.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/dtadg3/article31424162.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24NETYOUTUBE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/youtube-follows-twitter-and-facebook-with-qanon-crackdown/article32867310.ece

12,2020/10/16,"Trump, Biden at Parallel Townhalls","Candidates present contrasting views on the handling of the coronavirus pandemic

With less than three weeks to go for the elections, U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden offered contrasting visions for the country at two separate televised townhalls. Mr. Trump had pulled out of the second debate with Mr. Biden when the organizers had said it would be held virtually following the president’s recent infection with the coronavirus. The very different personalities of the candidates were also reflected in the differing tempos of the two townhalls.

Mr. Trump’s and Mr Biden’s differing visions came through in their descriptions of the handling of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 218,000 Americans. Both candidates took questions from their respective interviewers and socially distanced and masked members of the public in the audience.

Mr. Trump, speaking on NBC to Savannah Guthrie, attempted to deflect blame for his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic.

“We did the right thing. We were expected to lose 2,200,000 people, and maybe more than that. We’re at 210,000 people. One person is too much, it should have never happened, “Mr Trump said. “Because of China …it happened because of China. And you have to get that and understand that.”

On masks, he repeated – falsely– that a study had found that 85% of those wearing masks contracted the virus ( presumably a reference to a study cited by the Centres for Disease Control; which did reach this conclusion). Most studies have shown that wearing a mask reduces the transmission of the virus.

Meanwhile, at his townhall in Philadelphia with George Stephanopoulos of ABC, Mr Biden presented a contrasting perspective on Mr Trump and masks.

“The words of a president matter,” he said. “When a president doesn’t wear a mask or makes fun of folks like me when I was wearing a mask for a long time, then, you know, people say, ‘Well, it mustn’t be that important.’”

Mr. Biden said that Mr Trump had been informed about dangerous the virus was [ in late January , weeks before a national emergency was declared].

“He didn’t talk about what needed to be done because he kept worrying, in my view, about the stock market,” Mr Biden said.

On the economy too the candidates presented different pictures. Mr. Biden said he would raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, reversing, partly that aspect of the Trump tax cuts. Mr. Trump said raising corporate taxes would cause a depression and that he would work on a “middle income package.” Mr. Biden has repeatedly stated that he does not plan on raising taxes for those earning less than $ 400,000 a year.

Mr. Biden sought to defend his record in passing legislation during the ‘tough on crime’ era in the 1990s, the consequences of which fell disproportionately on African Americans. While he accepted that the legislation was a mistake he said those were different times and the bill was supported by Black mayors and the Congressional Black Caucus and that states had implemented the legislation incorrectly.

“Yes, it was. But here’s where the mistake came. The mistake came in terms of what the states did locally.”

On whether he would consider “packing” the Supreme Court [ increasing the number of justices from nine] if Republicans confirmed Trump nominee Amy Barrett , Mr Trump said the public would know his position by November 3. He said he would consider how the Senate handles the confirmation process of Ms Barrett.

“No matter what answer I gave you, if I say it, that’s the headline tomorrow. It won’t be about what’s going on now, the improper way they’re proceeding,” Mr Biden said.

At his townhall, Mr Trump stuck to his guns on an unsubstantiated claim about voter fraud related to mail-in ballots, Ms Guthrie said FBI Director Christopher Wray’s had concluded (as have others on both sides of the aisle) that there was no widespread fraud associated with the process.

“Then he’s not doing a very good job,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Wray.

On his own taxes, Mr. Trump did not deny that he owed $400 million in debt but said it was “a tiny percentage” of his net worth. [ A New York Times investigation had recently claimed Mr. Trump was $ 421 million in debt].

Mr. Trump was challenged by Ms Guthrie on the question of denouncing white supremacy, something he had failed to do unequivocally during the September presidential debate. He eventually denounced it, quickly pivoting to Antifa (which is an anti-fascist broad movement or ideology and not an organization) and “people on the left”.

“ I denounce white supremacy,” Mr Trump said. “And frankly, you want to know something? I denounce Antifa, and I denounce these people on the left that are burning down our cities, that are run by Democrats who don't know what they're doing…”

Mr Trump refused to provide straightforward (or any) denials to other conspiracy theories. When asked by Ms Guthrie if he would denounce the right wing QAnon conspiracy theory group’s claim that Democrats are a “Satanic paedophile ring”, Mr Trump said he knew “nothing” about the group but said he did know they “are very much against paedophilia,” again pivoting to Antifa and the “radical left.”

Mr. Trump also defended his retweeting of a conspiracy theory that Mr Biden killed the navy seal team that had faked the death of Al Qaida chief Osama bin Laden.

On the question of guaranteeing “the peaceful transition of power” Mr. Trump, as he has done before, made allegations of voter fraud, the Democrats spying on his campaign before eventually saying , “Peaceful transfer, I absolutely want that. But ideally, I don't want to transfer, because I want to win.”

The second and final presidential debate will be held on October 22 in Nashville, Tennessee.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/61824q/article32876387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-USA-ELECTIONFLORIDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-biden-at-parallel-townhalls/article32876388.ece
13,2020/10/16,"Johnson says prepare for no-deal Brexit, cancels talks","‘Unless EU changes course, U.K. to go for Australia-style pact’

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday it was now time to prepare for a no-trade deal Brexit unless the European Union fundamentally changed course, bluntly telling Brussels that there was no point in talking any more.

A tumultuous “no deal” finale to the United Kingdom’s five-year Brexit crisis would sow chaos through the delicate supply chains that stretch across Britain, the EU and beyond — just as the economic hit from the pandemic worsens.

EU ultimatum

At what was supposed to be the “Brexit Summit” on Thursday, the EU delivered an ultimatum: it said it was concerned by a lack of progress and called on U.K. to yield on key sticking points or see a rupture of ties with the bloc from January 1.

“I have concluded that we should get ready for January 1 with arrangements that are more like Australia’s based on simple principles of global free trade,” Mr. Johnson said. “With high hearts and with complete confidence, we will prepare to embrace the alternative and we will prosper mightily as an independent free trading nation, controlling and setting our own laws,” he added.

Mr. Johnson’s spokesman said shortly afterwards that talks were now over and there was no point in the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier coming to London next week barring a change in approach.

“The trade talks are over: the EU have effectively ended them by saying that they do not want to change their negotiating position,” his spokesman said.

Mr. Johnson’s brinkmanship, which follows an EU demand that U.K. make further concessions, may push Brexit towards disorder, though he left open the possibility that the EU could reconsider and offer Britain a better deal. “Unless there is a fundamental change of approach, we’re going to go for the Australia solution. And we should do it with great confidence,” he said.

A so-called “Australia deal” means that the U.K. would trade on World Trade Organization terms: as a country without an EU trade agreement, like Australia, tariffs would be imposed under WTO rules, likely causing significant price rises.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5klcm3/article32876144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-BRITAIN-UKRAINE-DIPLOMACY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/johnson-says-prepare-for-no-deal-brexit-cancels-talks/article32876145.ece
14,2020/10/16,Kyrgyzstan’s Prime Minister becomes acting President,"Speaker, the next in line to be the head of state, refused to step up

Kyrgyzstan’s Prime Minister became the acting head of state on Friday in the wake of the President’s resignation amid turmoil sparked by a disputed parliamentary election.

Supporters of newly appointed Prime Minister Sadyr Zhaparov, rallied in the capital, Bishkek, and threatened to storm government buildings, forcing President Sooronbai Jeenbekov to step down on Thursday. Under the Constitution, the Speaker of Parliament would be next in line, but he refused to serve as caretaker leader under protesters’ pressure, allowing Mr. Zhaparov to claim the top office.

The fast-moving developments mark the third time in 15 years that a leader of the Central Asian country has been forced out by a popular uprising. The unrest that gripped the country of 6.5 million people on the border with China was triggered by the Oct. 4 parliamentary election that was swept by pro-government parties.

Supporters of opposition groups dismissed the results, pointing at vote-buying and other irregularities, and took over government buildings hours after the polls closed. The protesters freed several opposition leaders, including Mr. Zhaparov, who was serving an 11-year jail term.

The Central Election Commission nullified the election results and rival regional clans begun jockeying for power, their supporters swarming the capital and occasionally clashing with each other, hurling stones.

President Jeenbekov, who had introduced a state of emergency in Bishkek and deployed troops in the capital, first dismissed calls to resign, but he announced on Thursday that he was stepping down to avoid bloodshed.

Mr. Zhaparov’s supporters quickly besieged the Parliament to discourage its speaker, Kanat Isayev, from taking over as acting President.

15,2020/10/16,Russia kicks off Caspian war games,"Moscow says it poses no threat to any State amid Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict

Russia on Friday said its Navy had begun military exercises in the central waters of the Caspian Sea north of the Azerbaijani capital Baku, insisting there was no threat to neighbouring states as Armenia and Azerbaijan battle over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

The war games are taking place north of Azerbaijan’s Absheron peninsula, where Baku is located, and will include artillery and rocket fire, the Defence Ministry said in a statement.

They involve six ships, seven planes and more than 400 servicemen, it added.

“The activities... do not pose any threat and do not impose restrictions on the economic activities of the Caspian littoral states,” it added.

Russia has so far kept its distance from the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the Armenian-controlled Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan.

CSTO exercise

But Armenia, unlike Azerbaijan, is a member of the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) military alliance and Yerevan has made clear it is hoping for Russian backing.

With protests still pressuring Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko after disputed elections, CSTO forces have also been taking part in joint military exercises this week in Belarus. The exercises are called “Indestructible Brotherhood”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/russia-kicks-off-caspian-war-games/article32876098.ece
16,2020/10/16,Will defend rights in South China sea: Philippines,"The Philippines is ready to defend the oil and gas exploration it has decided to resume in its internationally recognised waters in the disputed South China Sea and will not cede that right to any nation, the energy chief said on Friday.

The Department of Energy announced on Thursday that President Rodrigo Duterte has approved its recommendation to lift a 6-year-old moratorium on energy exploration in three offshore areas west of the Philippines, including in potentially oil- and gas-rich Reed Bank, which China also claims.

Companies with government contracts have been notified to resume their petroleum search, Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said.

Mr. Cusi told reporters in an online news conference on Friday that China was not informed of the Philippine government’s decision to resume oil exploration in its exclusive economic zone, a 320-km stretch of waters where a coastal state can exclusively exploit maritime resources under the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Reed Bank and two other exploration areas are within the Philippines’ exclusive zone but China is likely to assert its claim, Mr. Cusi said. “They will not just take it without raising a word. I’m sure they’re going to write us,” he said.

Asked how the Philippines will respond if China protests, Mr. Cusi replied, “We have to stand up for our rights, that’s what we are going to do.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/will-defend-rights-in-south-china-sea-philippines/article32876077.ece

18,2020/10/16,Twitter changes hacked content rules after Biden story furor,"The social media company will no longer remove hacked material unless it’s directly shared by hackers or those working with them.

Twitter said on Thursday it was changing its policy on hacked content after an outcry about its handling of an unverified political story that prompted cries of censorship from the right.

The social media company will no longer remove hacked material unless it’s directly shared by hackers or those working with them, the company’s head of legal, policy, trust and safety, Vijaya Gadde, said in a Twitter thread.

And instead of blocking links from being shared, tweets will be labeled to provide context, Ms. Gadde said.

“We want to address the concerns that there could be many unintended consequences to journalists, whistleblowers and others in ways that are contrary to Twitter’s purpose of serving the public conversation,” she said.

Twitter and Facebook had moved quickly this week to limit the spread of the story published by the conservative-leaning New York Post, which cited unverified emails from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s son that were reportedly discovered by President Donald Trump’s allies.

The story has not been confirmed by other publications.

Twitter initially responded by banning users from sharing links to the article in tweets and direct messages because it violated the company’s policy prohibiting hacked content.

But it didn’t alert users about why they couldn’t share the link until hours later.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted that it was unacceptable the company hadn’t provided more context around its action. A little over 24 hours later, Ms. Gadde announced the company was making changes after receiving significant feedback (from critical to supportive)” about how it enforced the policy.

Facebook said it was reducing the story’s distribution on its platform while waiting for third-party fact-checkers to verify it, something it regularly does with material that’s not banned outright from its service, though it risks spreading lies or causing harm in other ways.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/ma29ru/article32766513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/twitter-abjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/twitter-changes-hacked-content-rules-after-biden-story-furor/article32873781.ece
19,2020/10/16,Explainer: Why are Thai students protesting?,"Thailand’s government declared a state of emergency, banning public gatherings and censoring the media, to tackle the growing students’ protests.

The story so far

Thailand’s government, led by the Army chief-turned Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha, declared a state of emergency on Thursday, banning public gatherings and censoring the media, to tackle the growing students’ protests. The protesters have dismissed the emergency decree as yet another attempt by the government to take away their rights and vowed to continue the agitation, deepening the crisis that has shaken the country’s political and royal establishments.

What triggered the protests?

The roots of the current discontentment go back to the 2014 coup which brought Mr. Prayuth to power. Ever since, the junta tightened its grip on power and introduced more and more restrictions on the public. Many anti-junta activists, who fled the country during the coup and were living in neighbouring nations, went missing. At home, students were ordered to belt out a song every morning extolling Thai values. In 2017, the military introduced a new Constitution, which allowed the military to appoint a 250-member Senate that would play a role in selecting the Prime Minister. It also removed the need for the King to name a regent at home when he travels abroad.

The country held the delayed Parliamentary election last year, which was seen as an exercise to transfer power from the junta to an elected government. But Mr. Prayuth retained power after the disputed election. Public resentment was building up against the military’s outsized influence in the government. In February, the top court’s decision to dissolve the pro-democracy Future Forward Party, which gained the third largest vote share in the Parliamentary election, triggered instant demonstrations. The protests, which subsided in the following months due to the pandemic, sprang back into action in June after the disappearance of a dissident in Cambodia. From July onwards, students have maintained the street pressure on the government, and even started targeting the monarchy.

What is the role of the monarch?

The Thai monarchy has historically been shielded from public criticism by strict lese majeste laws. The monarchy lost absolute authority in the ‘Siamese revolution’ of 1932. But the King retained god-like status in society and enormous influence in the government. The reigning monarch, Maha Vajiralongkorn, assumed the throne in 2016 after the death of his father, the revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who at the time of his death was the world’s longest reigning monarch. The junta gave the new King full control of the Crown Property Bureau, which manages the palace’s roughly $30 billion worth of assets. Last year, the King brought two Army units under his direct control. King Vajiralongkorn’s plan appears to be taking the country closer to absolute monarchy. The Generals are on the line. But this has triggered unprecedented resistance from the country’s youth.

What are the students’ demands?

In August, Anon Nampa, a 35-year-old human rights lawyer and one of the leaders of the protesters, called for reforms to the monarchy. Students then submitted 10 demands to the government, asking for a separation of the King’s assets and the Crown Property Bureau. They also wanted to cut the Palace’s share in the national budget, a ban on the King from expressing his political views, and safeguards to prevent him from endorsing future coups. This was an unprecedented step given that criticism of the monarchy could be punished by prison terms up to 15 years in Thailand. The students have also called for the Prime Minister’s resignation; a new Constitution; fresh, free and fair elections; and an end to attacks on dissidents and Opposition parties such as the Future Forward Party.

How the protesters are using pop culture?

Unlike the past protests in which two political sides clashed with each other, the current movement is largely led by school and college students. They used young adult pop culture icons and symbols from the Harry Potter and The Hunger Games books and films for mobilising more young protesters against the government and the monarchy. In July, when the protests were still in the initial stages, hundreds of students sang a Japanese cartoon jingle in a rally, mocking the government as hungry hamsters feasting on taxpayers’ money. In August, thousands hit the street dressed in Harry Potter-style wizard costumes, holding up chopstick-wands. Instead of slogans, they cast mock spells against the “Death Eaters” of the establishment. They wanted both “the muggles and the wizards” to come together against the dark powers. The three-finger salute, a symbol of resistance and solidarity of the movement against the dystopian dictatorship of President Snow in The Hunger Games trilogy, was borrowed by the Thai protesters. On October 14, they raised the three-finger salute to a royal motorcade that was carrying Queen Suthida. A day after, the emergency decree was issued.

What does the government say?

The government says it won’t use force against the peaceful protesters, but has also warned them against “insulting” the monarchy. The authorities have not shown any readiness to accommodate the demands of the protesters. Now, the emergency gives the government more powers to tackle dissent and protests, and the police have already arrested some protest leaders. With the students refusing to stand down, Thailand could be descending to another showdown.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ia8lhw/article32873771.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAILANDSTUDENTS-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explainer-why-are-thai-students-protesting/article32873772.ece
20,2020/10/16,China defends Confucius Institutes now under fire from U.S.,"U.S. claims the program gives China’s ruling Communist Party a foothold on U.S. soil and threatens free speech.

Following scathing political attacks from the Trump administration, China on Friday defended its Confucius Institutes as apolitical facilitators of cultural and language exchange.

The U.S. administration last week urged schools and colleges to rethink their ties to the institutes that bring Chinese language classes to America but, according to federal officials, also invite a malign influence from China.

Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian disputed that characterisation and accused Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. politicians of acting out of ideological prejudice and personal political interests and having deliberately undermined the cultural and educational exchanges and cooperation between China and the U.S..

“The U.S. politicians should abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum thinking ... and stop politicising related programs of educational exchange, obstructing normal cultural exchanges between the two sides, and damaging mutual trust and cooperation between China and the U.S.,” Mr. Zhao said at a daily briefing.

Patterned after the British Council and Alliance Francaise, the Confucius Institutes are unique in that they set up operations directly on U.S. campuses and schools, drawing mounting scrutiny from U.S. officials amid increased tensions with China.

In letters to universities and state education officials, the State Department and Education Department said the program gives China’s ruling Communist Party a foothold on U.S. soil and threatens free speech. Schools are being advised to examine the program’s activities and take action to safeguard its educational environments.

More than 60 U.S. universities host Confucius Institutes through partnerships with an affiliate of China’s Ministry of Education, though the number has lately been dropping. China provides teachers and textbooks and typically splits the cost with the university.

The programme also brings Chinese language classes to about 500 elementary and secondary classrooms.

In last week’s letters, U.S. officials drew attention to China’s new national security law in Hong Kong, which critics say curtails free expression and other liberties.

The letters cite recent reports that some U.S. college professors are allowing students to opt out of discussions on Chinese politics amid fears that students from Hong Kong or China could be prosecuted at home.

Such fears are well justified, officials said, adding that at least one student from China was recently jailed by Chinese authorities over tweets he posted while studying at a U.S. university.

At least 39 universities have announced plans to shutter Confucius Institute programs since the start of 2019, according to a log published by the National Association of Scholars, a conservative nonprofit group.

Other nations have also sought to curb China’s influence in their schools, with regional educational departments in Canada and Australia cutting ties with the institutes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ntgciy/article31984033.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ZhaoLijianjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-defends-confucius-institutes-now-under-fire-from-us/article32873287.ece
21,2020/10/16,"Thai PM rejects calls to resign, braces for renewed protest","Protestors’ demands include amendment of constitution and reforms to nation’s monarchy.

Thailand’s Prime Minister rejected calls for his resignation on Friday as his government stepped up efforts to stop student-led protesters from rallying in the capital for a second day in defiance of a strict state of emergency.

Police closed roads and put up barricades around a major Bangkok intersection where the protesters have vowed to gather again to push their core demands, including that Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha leave office, the constitution be amended and the nation’s monarchy undergo reform.

Police in riot gear moved into the area, while malls in the normally busy shopping district were closing early. Nearby mass transit stations were being closed to stop crowds of protesters from getting near the area. In addition to the security measures, heavy monsoon rains threatened to keep crowd numbers lower than the thousands that gathered the night before.

The student protesters said they would simply rally just down the street at another large intersection.

Mr. Prayuth’s government declared a strict new state of emergency for the capital on Thursday, a day after protesters gathered in a different part of the city heckled a royal motorcade. Such actions are unprecedented in Thailand, where those waiting for a royal motorcade regularly sit on the ground or prostrate themselves.

The state of emergency outlaws public gatherings of more than five people and bans the dissemination of news that is deemed to threaten national security. It also gives authorities broad powers, including detaining people at length without charge.

Some 10,000 protesters defied the decree on Thursday to rally at the Bangkok intersection.

A number of protest leaders have already been rounded up since the decree went into effect. On Friday another two activists were arrested under a law covering violence against the queen for their alleged part in the heckling of the motorcade. They could face up to life in prison if convicted.

The protest movement was launched in March by university students and its original core demands were new elections, changes in the constitution to make it more democratic, and an end to intimidation of activists.

The protesters charge that Mr. Prayuth, who as army commander led a 2014 coup that toppled an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year’s general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party.

But the movement took a stunning turn in August, when students at a rally aired unprecedented criticism of the monarchy and issued calls for its reform. Using direct language normally expressed in whispers if at all, the speakers criticised the King’s wealth, his influence and that he spends much of his time outside the country.

Thailand’s royal family has long been considered sacrosanct and a pillar of Thai identity. King Maha Vajiralongkorn and other key members of the royal family are protected by a lese majeste law that has regularly been used to silence critics who risk up to 15 years in prison if deemed to have insulted the institution.

Conservative royalist Thais accuse the protest movement of seeking to end the monarchy, an allegation its leaders deny.

Wednesday’s incident with the royal motorcade was stunned many Thais. Video that circulated widely showed members of a small crowd heckling a motorcade carrying Queen Suthida and Prince Dipangkorn as it slowly passed. Security personnel stood between the vehicles and the crowd and there was no visible violence and none was described by witnesses.

Mr. Prayuth’s declaration of a state of emergency said the measure was necessary because “certain groups of perpetrators intended to instigate an untoward incident and movement in the Bangkok area by way of various methods and via different channels, including causing obstruction to the royal motorcade.”

Mr. Prayuth said on Friday that he had no plans to resign as he had done nothing wrong. He said his government hopes it can drop the state of emergency ahead of its normal 30-day duration “if the situation improves quickly.”

The legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights said at least 51 people have been arrested since Tuesday in connection with the protests.

Police on Friday went to search the offices of the Progressive Movement, a group formed by former lawmakers from a reform-minded political party that was controversially dissolved by the Constitutional Court.

The two activists charged over the incident with the queen are Ekachai Hongkangwan and Paothong Bunkueanum.

Mr. Ekachai is a veteran activist who has been physically attacked several times, in apparent response to his criticism of the military. Mr. Paothong, a university student, has been involved in organizing the protests.

The Wednesday incident in which the two were allegedly involved was stunning to most Thais, because by tradition and law, members of the royal family are treated with the utmost respect.

""We were not notified by the police of the upcoming royal motorcade in which we had no way of knowing because they were not informing us,” Mr. Paothong told reporters Friday.

""Once we knew that there was a motorcade of the queen and the heir presumptive to the throne I tried to break away from the line and use my megaphone to have everyone move away from the police barriers so the motorcade can pass through easily,” he said.

The Ministry of Digital Economy, meanwhile, announced it would file complaints with police covering five Twitter accounts and five Facebook accounts inviting people to attend Friday’s rally. Such posting could be deemed illegal under the state of emergency, as well as other laws.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nuvi93/article32872972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THTHAILANDPM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/thai-pm-rejects-calls-to-resign-braces-for-renewed-protest/article32872973.ece

23,2020/10/16,"U.S. Presidential election | Imposing coronavirus lockdown unconstitutional, says Donald Trump","Donald Trump said he is not averse to wearing a mask, but people with masks are catching it all the time

Defending holding public events during the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. President Donald Trump, who tested positive for COVID-19 early this month, has said that as a President he cannot remain locked in a basement and he has to meet people despite the risks.

Mr. Trump, responding to a question at a townhall organised by the NBC News, also defended not wearing a mask as much as his own administration’s public health experts recommend and said that lockdowns imposed by various states across the country to curb the coronavirus cases were “unconstitutional”.

He said he is not averse to wearing a mask, but people with masks are catching it all the time.

“As a President, I have to be out there. I can’t be in a basement. I can’t be locked in a very beautiful room some place in the White House. And I want to see the gold star families, and I want to see everybody. And I also say to people all the time, it’s risky doing it. It is risky doing it”, Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Trump was tested positive for COVID-19 on October 1 and was admitted to a military hospital for three nights and four days. He declared himself cured after he was treated with an experimental antibody drug cocktail.

Mr. Trump was briefly forced to pause his re-election campaign after he tested positive for COVID-19 and he returned to the campaign trail from the battleground State of Florida on Monday. White House doctors have now cleared him for holding election rallies.

When the townhall moderator asked him why he is not wearing a mask, Mr. Trump said, “I can, but people with masks are catching it all the time. I mean, if you look at the Governor of Virginia, he was known for a mask. If you look at Thom Tillis, a great guy, he always had a mask, and they caught it.

“You have to understand, as a President, I can’t be locked in a room for the next year and just stay and do nothing. And every time I go into a crowd, I was with the parents of our fallen heroes. These people are the most incredible people. And they came up to me and they would hug me, and they would touch me, and I’m not to not let them do it, to be honest with you,” he said.

Mr. Trump contested when the moderator said that as a leader he can set an example by wearing masks.

“But many people are catching it. Many people are getting this disease that was sent to us by China, and it should not have been allowed to happen. But many people are getting this. And I mean, nobody’s being blamed. Everybody is working hard to get this thing out of our country, get it out of the world,” he said.

Pointing that new infections have surged across Europe over recent weeks, Mr. Trump said, “They’ve done a very good job, but now you take a look today at the UK, you take a look at Spain and France and Italy. There is tremendous spike.”

Responding to another question, Mr. Trump stressed that the lockdowns imposed by various states across the country to curb the coronavirus cases were “unconstitutional”.

“The fact is we’re winning all these cases because it’s unconstitutional what they’re doing. And I think they’re doing it for political reasons. But the fact is the cure, you can’t let this continue to go on with the lockdowns. And I believe that on November 4th, you’re going to have a lot of these governors, he said at the Town Hall.”

24,2020/10/16,Coronavirus curbs widen England's north-south rift,"Liverpool, that gave the world the Beatles, feels it’s being punished by policies made in Britain’s capital, 290 km to the south

Liverpool, the English port city that gave the world the Beatles, weathered decades of industrial decline before becoming a celebrated symbol of urban renewal. Now, the coronavirus is putting the city’s hard-won revival in jeopardy, and raising tensions between the north of England and the wealthier south.

Scarred by abandoned buildings and government neglect during the 1980s, Liverpool made itself vibrant again by promoting local culture, nightlife, soccer and ties to the Fab Four. However, Liverpudlians retained their mistrust of London politicians, and the virus pandemic has brought it to the surface.

As the first area in England slapped with strict new restrictions to curb the resurgent coronavirus that have shuttered pubs and imperiled thousands of jobs, Liverpool again feels it’s being punished by policies made in Britain’s capital, 290 km to the south.

""At the beginning, when we all went into lockdown, it made sense. We were all doing it for a reason, and that was fine,” said pub owner Fiona Hornsby, who reluctantly shuttered her Bridewell bar in accordance with new curbs on business and socializing the government imposed this week.

With the complex localised restrictions, “it’s almost like we’re being separated, divided. It just doesn’t feel right at all,” she said.

Liverpool is not alone. As a patchwork of city — and region-specific measures replaces Britain’s nationwide lockdown, the pandemic has highlighted the gap in wealth and health between the relatively affluent south of England and the post-industrial north that also includes the cities of Manchester, Newcastle and Leeds.

Manchester — once an engine of the Industrial Revolution and now a hub for Britain’s music and creative industries — also is likely to fall under the government’s new restrictions. Mayor Andy Burnham is holding out for more financial support before consenting.

Burnham, a member of the left-of-center Labour Party that is in the opposition at the national level, accused the government Thursday of treating people in northern England as “second-class citizens” by imposing “a punishing lockdown without proper support for the people and businesses affected.”

The Hindu Explains | Why is Phase-3 of COVID-19 vaccine trial complicated?

When the coronavirus first hit the U.K. this year, the government told all but essential workers to stay home and ordered most businesses to close. The wide lockdown slowed the spread of the virus, but not before the country racked up Europe’s highest COVID-19 death toll. It currently stands at more than 43,200, though all such official figures are likely an underestimate.

The surge in new confirmed cases since shops, restaurants and other businesses reopened during the summer and students returned to schools and universities in the fall is more uneven than the U.K.’s first wave; infection rates currently are much higher in northern England than they are in the south.

In response, the U.K. government this week adopted a three-tier system that ranks cities and regions in England as medium, high or very high risk. Only the Liverpool region of 1.6 million people was immediately placed in the top tier, which requires pubs to shut and bars households from mixing.

Liverpool, worst hit

Authorities in northern England agree on the need to act. With more than 600 cases per 100,000 people and its intensive care units 90% full, Liverpool is one of Europe’s worst-hit cities at this stage of the pandemic.

But there is also resentment over what many see as the government moving too quickly to lift the national lockdown restrictions and failing to create an efficient test-and-trace system to contain new outbreaks.

""The embers of the infection here were never extinguished and they burned brighter up here than they did elsewhere in the country,” Paul Brant, a Labour Party member of the Liverpool City Council, said.

""Unfortunately, policy in this country is too often directed as a result of what happens in the capital rather than the local conditions that are taking place here in the north,” Brant said.

Liverpool’s public officials want more say in controlling the city’s outbreak, an exit strategy for lifting the restrictions and money to make up for years of government spending cuts that have left public services in Britain’s less affluent areas threadbare.

The north-south tensions that the pandemic stirred up are never far from the surface. David Jeffrey, a lecturer in British politics at the University of Liverpool, said Liverpool’s 1980s clashes over money and policy with the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher fostered a “’them versus us’ narrative” toward London.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a Conservative like Thatcher, is especially unpopular in the city. Liverpool natives, commonly known as Scousers, still remember that years ago a magazine Johnson edited accused them of “wallowing” in victimhood.

""In Liverpool, this idea of ‘Scousers don’t trust Tories’ ties in to trust in the government and their corona message,” Jeffrey said. “So if there’s no trust in the competency of the government, people aren’t going to follow the rules.”

Video footage showing young revelers partying in the city’s street with little regard for social distancing on Tuesday night, hours before the new restrictions took hold, drove home that point.

Before the pandemic, that image would have been seen as a sign of the city’s success. Liverpool’s docks on the River Mersey, left abandoned as ships moved elsewhere in the late 20th century, have been regenerated with restaurants and museums, including an international slavery museum and a Tate art gallery.

Four universities give the city a youthful, lively population, and Premier League soccer teams Liverpool and Everton support thousands of jobs. Tourists come from around the world to see the houses where the city’s most famous sons, the Beatles, grew up and the Cavern Club where they honed their craft.

All that is on hold now.

""The football, the nightlife, people coming into town - it’s all gone,” said John Ambrose, a guide with the Beatles-themed Fab4 Taxi Tours. “We used to do about 4,000 tours a year. We probably only did about 12% of that this year.”

Government scientific advisers have suggested the current restrictions may not be enough and there will have to be even tougher measures, maybe a total lockdown, to bring the outbreak under control.

Some fear that the gains of northern cities like Liverpool and Manchester could be undone.

“Liverpool fought, everyone fought, to get into a position now where we were all actually looking forward to 2020,” John Hughes, the head of local industry group Liverpool Pubwatch, said. “But the situation we are in now is, we’re going to go back to them dark days of the ‘80s.”

Local business owners say the support offered by the government - paying two-thirds of the salaries of workers in businesses forced to close - isn’t enough to prevent widespread hardship this winter.

""I think if they came up and spoke to us, actually came and talked to us, then maybe they’d understand and maybe think about things a little differently,” said pub owner Hornsby, who has laid off 20 staff members. “But they don’t, do they?”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ow63q7/article32870407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDLIVERPOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-curbs-widen-englands-north-south-rift-stir-animosity/article32870408.ece
25,2020/10/16,Malaysia's Anwar Ibrahim faces police probe over bid to become PM,"The Opposition leader met the nation’s king on Tuesday to show evidence that he has majority support in Parliament to form a new government and unseat Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who only has a thin two-seat majority in the house.

Malaysia’s opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim is set to be questioned by police Friday over his claim that he has a list of lawmakers supporting his bid to oust the government.

Anwar met the nation’s king on Tuesday to show evidence that he has majority support in Parliament to form a new government and unseat Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who only has a thin two-seat majority in the house.

Police said in a statement Thursday they received 113 complaints over a list of 121 lawmakers allegedly backing Anwar. They didn’t disclose details of the complains. The list has made rounds on social media.

Police said they are investigating the complains under provisions in the penal code covering statements of public mischief and a multimedia law on the improper use of network facilities to harass someone. Anwar has been summoned to the police headquarters to give his statement on Friday.

Anwar, 73, has said the king will meet leaders of political parties to verify his claim but hasn’t commented on the police investigation.

Muhyiddin, who took power in March after causing the collapse of Anwar’s reformist alliance, has previously dismissed Anwar’s claim of having secured support of a majority of lawmakers to unseat him but faced increasing pressure this week.

After Anwar’s audience with the king, the key ally in Muhyiddin’s ruling coalition threatened to withdraw support for the government amid anger over being sidelined despite being the biggest party.

Several lawmakers, both in the ruling coalition and the opposition, have also sought a vote of no confidence against Muhyiddin when Parliament resumes Nov. 2. But the motion may be thwarted by the house speaker, who is aligned with the premier.

Muhyiddin has said he would leave it to King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah to decide on the political tussle, which is likely to drag on as the monarch has postponed meetings with party leaders due to restrictions imposed in Kuala Lumpur this week to stem a surge in coronavirus cases.

The king Thursday advised political leaders to “avoid plunging the country into another political crisis” during the pandemic. In a statement, he urged politicians to settle their dispute through negotiations and under legal processes based on the constitution.

Anwar’s Alliance of Hope was elected in 2018 but collapsed after Muhyiddin withdrew his party and tied up with the opposition to form a Malay-centric government in March. Then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resigned in protest, saying he wouldn’t work with parties accused of corruption that he ousted in the 2018 polls.

If Anwar succeeds, it would mark a dramatic comeback after his roller-coaster political journey since the 1990s.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g989g5/article32869811.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDANWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malaysias-anwar-ibrahim-faces-police-probe-over-bid-to-become-pm/article32869812.ece
26,2020/10/16,Improper disinfection at hospital reason for new COVID-19 cluster in China: Official,"Inappropriate disinfection in the CT room at the Qingdao Chest Hospital has led to the new cluster of COVID-19 infections in Qingdao, Ma Lixin, the deputy party chief of the provincial Health Commission, said

Improper disinfection at a hospital in China’s Qingdao has caused the new COVID-19 cluster infections, prompting the city to test over 10 million people, a senior local health official said on Friday.

No new positive cases were reported from over 10 million tests in the city.

Inappropriate disinfection in the CT room at the Qingdao Chest Hospital has led to the new cluster of COVID-19 infections in Qingdao, Ma Lixin, the deputy party chief of the provincial Health Commission, said at a press conference.

The possibility that the new cluster infections were caused by cross-infection in the community was also ruled out, state-run Xinhua news agency, quoted him as saying.

He said no community transmission has occurred.

The Qingdao cluster has created nationwide concern as thousands visited the tourist city during the recent National Day holidays.

Beijing officials announced strict management of international arrivals to the capital, including three tests — before departure, at Chinese customs and after finishing a quarantine period.

Some 34 hotels have been opened for medical observation for people who entered the capital after September 3, when the city resumed some international flights.

As of Thursday, the Qingdao city had collected and tested more than 10.4 million samples and had released more than 8.8 million results, state-run China Daily reported.

Sui Ruwen, the city’s vice-mayor and chief of the public security bureau, said there were no additional positive results beyond those already under quarantine.

The testing effort, which aims to cover the total population of 11 million residents, is expected to be finished on Friday, he said.

On Thursday morning, the city reported one new confirmed COVID-19 case.

The case is an independent virus infection of a 40-year-old port worker whose test was positive but had showed no symptoms three weeks ago.

“Generally, the incubation period of the virus ranges from one to 14 days, but there are also reported cases whose incubation period lasted four weeks,” said Sun Yunbo, director of a medical experts team organised to treat the city’s novel coronavirus, adding that the dock worker is an individual case.

The new case was in addition to 12 infections reported earlier, which were closely linked to the city’s pulmonary hospital.

Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that efforts in the coming days should be focused on the close contacts of cases in the pulmonary hospital, especially if there are close contacts that have not been found out and isolated.

“Priorities for prevention should be on wards in hospitals, especially those receiving overseas confirmed cases, and the use of major medical equipment should also be isolated,” said Mr. Wu.

“Wearing face masks, keeping social distances and washing hands frequently should become a daily routine,” he added, the China Daily reported.

In response to the recent outbreak in Qingdao, Sui Zhenhua, director of the Qingdao health commission, was suspended from his post and is being investigated, and Deng Kai, dean of the pulmonary hospital, was removed, according to the statements from the city government on Thursday.

Meanwhile China’s National Health Commission, (NHC) said on Friday a total of 24 confirmed cases arriving from outside the mainland were reported on Friday.

One new suspected COVID-19 case from outside the mainland was reported in Shanghai, the commission said.

Of the new imported cases, 11 were reported in Shanghai, five in Inner Mongolia, two in Tianjin, Jiangsu and Guangdong each, and one in Fujian and Chongqing each, according to the commission.

By the end of Thursday, 240 people, who came from abroad were being treated in hospitals. The Commission said 376 asymptomatic cases, including 375 from outside the mainland, were still under medical observation.

As of Thursday, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases on the Chinese mainland had reached 85,646, of whom 253 patients are still being treated, with four in severe condition.

Altogether 80,759 patients had been discharged after recovery, and the death toll due to coronavirus stood at 4,634, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2o2xrn/article32869340.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/QINGDAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/improper-disinfection-at-hospital-reason-for-new-covid-19-cluster-in-china-official/article32869228.ece
27,2020/10/16,Israeli parliament formally approves UAE normalisation deal,"The UAE has become just the third Arab country to establish official ties with Israel after Egypt and Jordan.

Israel’s parliament on Thursday voted overwhelmingly in favor of formally ratifying the country’s historic agreement normalising diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates.

Israel and the UAE announced the U.S.-brokered agreement in August, and signed a deal in a White House ceremony last month. Thursday’s approval by the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, which passed in a 80-13 vote, was largely a formality.

The UAE has become just the third Arab country to establish official ties with Israel, after Egypt and Jordan, and the first to do so in a quarter century. Bahrain is also in the process of formalising ties with Israel, and the White House has suggested that other Arab countries will follow suit.

The deals reflect a shift in the Middle East as Arab countries’ shared concerns with Israel about Iran outweigh their traditional support for the Palestinians.

Many Arab and Muslim countries want to get close to us, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech. They see our military and intelligence, technological and economic power. They are changing their attitude toward us. The Palestinians, who have long relied on unified Arab support to boost them against Israel, have condemned the deal and accused the UAE of betrayal.

The Joint List, the main Arab-dominated faction in parliament, cast the lone opposing votes on Thursday in solidarity with their Palestinian brethren.

Ayman Odeh, chairman of the Joint List, said the only deal that would bring peace and prosperity to the region would be a peace agreement creating an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.

“The deal being signed today is part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s dangerous vision that ... will perpetuate the military regime on millions of Palestinians, the settlements and the outposts,” he wrote in a tweet before the vote.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5uu81u/article32597252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BENJAMINNETANYAHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israeli-parliament-formally-approves-uae-normalisation-deal/article32868882.ece
28,2020/10/16,"Coronavirus | Repurposed drugs did not cut down mortality, says WHO","Use of remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon was tracked in a multi-country study.

Interim results from the Solidarity Therapeutics Trial, coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO), have indicated that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course of COVID-19 among hospitalised patients as per information released by the World Health Organisation.

Speaking exclusively to The Hindu, about the outcome Prof. K Srinath Reddy, member executive steering group, WHO Solidarity Trials and co-author of the study, said: “The SOLIDARITY trial is the largest trial to examine the effect of four treatments on the risk of death in hospitalised patients of COVID-19. As a multi-country study it offers the advantage of large patient numbers needed to reach meaningful conclusions on this very important clinical outcome and also provides generalisability of its conclusions across diverse populations across the world.’’

He added that the trial has not shown any benefit on overall survival of any of the four tested drugs on reducing the risk of dying in hospitalised patients of COVID-19 .

“The trial will continue to evaluate other promising interventions for their ability to save lives, through rigorously examined evidence from a large randomised trial methodology,” said Dr. Reddy.

In six months, the world’s largest randomised control trial on COVID-19 therapeutics has generated conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of repurposed drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, noted the WHO release.

It added that the study, which spans more than 30 countries, looked at the effects of these treatments on overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay in hospitalized patients. Other uses of the drugs, for example in treatment of patients in the community or for prevention, would have to be examined using different trials.

“The progress achieved by the Solidarity Therapeutics Trial shows that large international trials are possible, even during a pandemic, and offer the promise of quickly and reliably answering critical public health questions concerning therapeutics,” noted the WHO, adding that the results of the trial are under review for publication in a medical journal and have been uploaded as preprint at medRxiv.

Meanwhile the global platform of the Solidarity Trial, according to experts, is ready to rapidly evaluate promising new treatment options, with nearly 500 hospitals open as trial sites.

“Newer antiviral drugs, immune-modulators and anti-SARS COV-2 monoclonal antibodies are now being considered for evaluation,” said WHO.

The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), an active partner in the trials, said in a statement, “ICMR has succeeded in conducting this large randomised controlled study even during a pandemic situation and earlier lockdown. This study reliably answers to critical public health questions concerning therapeutics. Earlier, ICMR conducted PLACID trial for convalescent plasma indicating no benefit of it in COVID treatment.”

“The trial comprised 26 actively randomizing sites with 937 participants in India. We are grateful to the trial participants and their families for contributing to these crucial findings,” said Samiran Panda, head, ICMR-Division of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases.

'We are looking at immunomodulators'

WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Wednesday that during the study, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir were stopped in June after they proved ineffective, but other trials continued in more than 500 hospitals and 30 countries.

“We're looking at what's next. We're looking at monoclonal anti-bodies, we're looking at immunomodulators and some of the newer anti-viral drugs that have been developed in the last few months,” Ms. Swaminathan said.

29,2020/10/16,Syria Kurds free hundreds of Islamic State militants as part of amnesty,"The Syrian Democratic Council said the 631 prisoners were released on Thursday while 253 others will have their terms cut in half.

Kurdish-led authorities released on Thursday hundreds of militants from the Islamic State group imprisoned in northern Syria, as part of a general amnesty in the region controlled by the U.S.-backed fighters.

Amina Omar, the head of the Syrian National Council, told reporters that IS members who were released have “no blood on their hands” and have all repented joining IS at some point.

They are people who can be reformed, Omar said shortly before the men were freed.

The Syrian Democratic Council said the 631 prisoners were released on Thursday while 253 others will have their terms cut in half. It said the amnesty and the release followed requests by tribal leaders in northeastern and eastern Syria.

Kurdish authorities currently operate more than two dozen detention facilities scattered across northeastern Syria, holding about 10,000 IS fighters. Among the detainees are some 2,000 foreigners whose home countries have refused to repatriate them, including about 800 Europeans.

The Islamic State group — which at the height of its power in 2014 controlled a third of both Iraq and Syria — lost its last sliver of land last year when the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces captured the eastern Syrian village of Baghouz.

Since then, the extremists have gone underground, carrying out hit-and-run attacks, mostly targeting Syrian government forces and the Kurdish-led fighters.

Earlier this month, the Kurdish-led authority said it will allow Syrian citizens to leave a sprawling camp that houses tens of thousands of women and children, many of them linked to IS.

Most of the detainees at al-Hol camp are Syrian and Iraqi women and children. Another highly secured tent settlement that is part of the camp is known as the Annex and is home to some 10,000 hard-line IS supporters from other countries.

The overpopulated camp is home to a total of 65,000 people and has been a burden to the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Kurdish police in charge of security at the facility. Crime rates have been high inside the camp and some of the women have tried to escape.

Over the past 10 days dozens of families have left the camp.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/68a2vo/article32868618.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKSYRIA-CONFLICT-KURDS-PRISONERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/syria-kurds-free-hundreds-of-islamic-state-militants-as-part-of-amnesty/article32868619.ece
30,2020/10/16,Power cut to thousands in California to prevent wildfires,"People have been buying generators, electrical cords, flashlights, batteries, gas cans and other supplies to help them deal with the latest outage, expected to last through Friday evening.

Thousands of people in wine country were without power Thursday amid a fall heat wave that brought another round of extreme wildfire danger to large portions of already battered Northern California.

Pacific Gas and Electric cut power starting Wednesday evening to more than 45,000 customers — about 100,000 people — mainly in the Sierra Nevada foothills and the San Francisco Bay Area. Some restorations began Thursday afternoon, and by evening the number of customers without power was about 30,000, the utility said. All power was expected to be restored by Friday night.

Many in wine country north of San Francisco were feeling drained by what seems like a never-ending wildfire season in the region.

Kathleen Collins has had to evacuate her home in the mountains of Napa County four times in the past five years because of fires. This summer, she lived in a motel for two weeks after leaving her home when a massive cluster of fires reached her tiny community of Pope Valley.

""It’s all very stressful. People are not happy, but there’s not much they can do about it,” said Collins, assistant manager at Silverado Ace Hardware store in Calistoga, a Napa County town of 5,000 people who were allowed to return home just last week after the Glass fire forced them out last month. The blaze that ravaged areas of Napa and Sonoma counties was contained Wednesday after destroying more than 1,500 homes and other buildings.

People have been buying generators, electrical cords, flashlights, batteries, gas cans and other supplies to help them deal with the latest outage, expected to last through Friday evening, Collins said.

More than 8,500 wildfires have burned more than 6,400 square miles (16,000 square kilometers) in California since the start of the year. Most have occurred since mid-August. Thirty-one people have died, and more than 9,200 buildings have been destroyed.

In Southern California, a brush fire Thursday near Redlands triggered a small evacuation as it grew to more than 100 acres (40 hectares). It was about 50% contained.

Collins said she received a message alerting her that her home would lose power Wednesday night and she dreaded having to throw away all her refrigerated food as in past outages. Fortunately, she hadn’t lost electricity as of Thursday.

Some people and businesses in Calistoga, including the hardware store, and in the small communities of Pope Valley and Angwin, were getting electricity from temporary generators brought in by PG&E. The utility better targeted outages this time after it was criticized in 2019 for cutting power to about 800,000 customers and leaving some 2 million people in the dark for days.

""For them to leave our power on is really awesome because we’ve all suffered so much in the last month,” Collins said.

Mark Quinlan, PG&E’s incident commander, said 12,000 more customers would have lost power Wednesday if not for PG&E’s new microtargeting, which state officials ordered after last year’s missteps.

""These are challenging times. Not only are we right in the peak of the wildfire season ... many of us are working from home, schooling from home as well,” he said. “We recognize that hardships are introduced when we shut off power.”

Barbara Nemko, Napa County’s superintendent of schools, said the warnings of high winds and intense heat sent “a shiver down my spine.”

""After undergoing two major fires in the last two months it’s almost unthinkable that we are having to prepare yet again for the possibility,” Nemko said.

She said the district has been fortunate that no public schools burned this year. Still, the costs have piled up as schools had to throw out large quantities of spoiled food, buy pricey filters to address terrible air quality and ash in the air, and secure generators to deal with outages.

Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists have said climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.

The weather prompted California’s electrical grid operator to issue a statewide Flex Alert urging people to conserve energy between 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday by turning down air conditioners and not using major appliances. Previous conservation efforts this summer were praised for reducing the power demand and avoiding rolling blackouts after an August outage caught many people off guard.

PG&E’s targeted power cuts beginning Wednesday were the third in less than two months aimed at preventing downed or fouled power lines and other equipment from sparking wildfires.

PG&E’s aging equipment has sparked several major fires in recent years, including a 2018 blaze that killed 85 people and destroyed much of the town of Paradise. The community was among those affected by the outages Wednesday, which led school officials to suspended all virtual classes.

The utility pleaded guilty in June to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter - one death was ruled a suicide - and paid $25.5 billion in settlements to cover losses from that and other recent power line-sparked catastrophes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qb6blh/article32867723.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDCALIFORNIAPOWERCUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/power-cut-to-thousands-in-california-to-prevent-wildfires/article32867724.ece
31,2020/10/16,"In split-screen town halls, Donald Trump and Joe Biden squabble over coronavirus response","The rivals spoke in simultaneous town halls broadcast on separate television networks after a debate originally scheduled for Thursday was called off following Mr. Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Thursday criticised what he called President Donald Trump's “panicked” response to the coronavirus pandemic, while Mr. Trump defended his handling of a crisis that has killed more than 216,000 Americans.

The rivals spoke in simultaneous town halls broadcast on separate television networks after a debate originally scheduled for Thursday was called off following Mr. Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis.

The split-screen showdown offered a stark reminder of the many ways the campaign season has been changed by a pandemic that has prompted more than 18 million people to cast ballots more than two weeks before Election Day on November 3.

Mr. Biden, speaking to voters in Philadelphia on ABC, blamed the Republican president for concealing the deadliness of the virus that has killed more than 216,000 people in the United States.

“He said he didn't tell anybody because he was afraid Americans would panic,” Mr. Biden said. “Americans don't panic. He panicked.”

Mr. Trump defended both his response to the pandemic as well as his own personal conduct, including staging a Rose Garden event at the White House where few wore masks or practiced social distancing, which resulted in numerous attendees contracting the disease.

“Hey, I'm President — I have to see people, I can't be in a basement,” Trump said on NBC in front of an outdoor audience of voters in Miami, implicitly criticising Mr. Biden for spending months off the campaign trail as the pandemic raged.

He did not answer questions about the last time he tested negative before getting the virus, saying he did not recall precisely.

Mr. Trump, who aggressively interrupted Mr. Biden during a chaotic debate two weeks ago, showed little interest in altering his belligerent tone, sparring frequently with moderator Samantha Guthrie.

He said he “heard different stories” about the efficacy of masks, even though his own administration's public health experts have said wearing them is key to stopping the spread of the virus.

The President declined to denounce QAnon, the false conspiracy theory that Democrats are part of a global pedophile ring, first praising its adherents for opposing pedophilia before saying he knew nothing about the movement.

Mr. Trump also dodged questions about a New York Times investigation of two decades of his tax returns, which he has refused to release publicly despite decades of precedent for presidential candidates.

He appeared to confirm the paper's report that he has some $400 million in personally guaranteed loans, arguing that the amount was a “peanut” compared with his worth. He also did not deny the Times' report that he paid only $750 in federal income tax during his first year in the White House, although he said at one point the paper's numbers were “wrong.”

Early voting surge

The second presidential debate had originally been scheduled for Thursday, but Mr. Trump pulled out of the event after organisers decided to turn it into a virtual affair following his diagnosis two weeks ago. A final debate is still scheduled for October 22 in Nashville, Tennessee.

Mr. Trump, who spent three days in a military hospital but has since returned to the campaign trail, is trying to alter the dynamics of the race. Reuters/Ipsos polls show Mr. Biden has a significant national lead, although his advantage in battleground states is less pronounced.

North Carolina, a highly competitive state, saw huge lines as it began more than two weeks of in-person early voting on Thursday, following record turnout in Georgia and Texas earlier in the week.

Some 18.3 million Americans have voted either in person or by mail so far, representing 12.9% of the total votes counted in the 2016 general election, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.

Voters are seeking to avoid in-person lines on Election Day to stay safe as coronavirus infections and hospitalisations continue to rise, but also to make sure their ballots will count. Many are concerned that Mr. Trump will challenge widely used mail-in ballots, after his repeated claims without evidence that they were fraudulent.

Supreme Court battle

The Senate confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett, Mr. Trump's nominee for a vacant Supreme Court seat, prompted careful answers from both candidates. Republicans have pushed to seat Ms. Barrett before the election after refusing to do so for former Democratic President Barack Obama's nominee in 2016, saying it was inappropriate in an election year.

Mr. Biden said he was not a “fan” of court-packing, the idea promoted by some Democrats of adding justices to countermand what they view as a stolen seat. But he declined to rule it out after moderator George Stephanopoulos pressed him, saying: “It depends on how this turns out.”

MR. Trump would not say whether he would like to see abortion rights invalidated, an outcome that many legal scholars believe is more likely with the conservative Ms. Barrett on the court.

“I think that she's going to make a great decision,” he said. “I did not tell her what decision to make.”

$1.5 billion

In a sign of Democratic determination to defeat Mr. Trump, a massive amount of money has poured into the party's coffers in recent months.

Democratic fundraising organization ActBlue said on Thursday it collected $1.5 billion online from July to September, the most it had ever raised in one quarter. By comparison, major Republican fundraising platform WinRed said on Monday that it collected $623.5 million in the same period.

Biden's campaign collected $383 million in September, setting a new record for a U.S. campaign for the second consecutive month. The Trump campaign has not released its monthly figures.

32,2020/10/16,European Union chief self-isolates as virus makes its mark at a summit,"“I myself have tested negative,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, a doctor by training, tweeted

As a renewed wave of the coronavirus sweeps across much of Europe, the reality of the disease struck a summit of European Union leaders on October 15 when one of the 27-nation bloc’s top officials abandoned the meeting to go into self-imposed quarantine.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen left the summit venue in Brussels shortly after the meeting began because one of her close staffers tested positive for COVID-19.

“I myself have tested negative,” Ms. von der Leyen, a doctor by training, tweeted.

However, as a precaution I am immediately leaving the European Council to go into self-isolation.

In its latest update on October 15, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said that more than 4.4 million cases of the virus have been reported in the 27 EU nations, plus Britain, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland since the pandemic began. More than 198,000 people have died. Several nations are tightening preventive measures.

“We are seeing a deterioration of the COVID-19 situation everywhere in Europe. It means that we need more cooperation at a European level,” European Council President Charles Michel, who is chairing the two-day summit, told reporters.

Mr. Michel said the leaders would focus on how to improve tracing capacity, how to harmonize the quarantines in place to hold back what is a great threat for many European countries, that pushes them to take new restrictive measures.

Images from inside the venue, which is off limits to reporters, showed Ms. von der Leyen mingling with several other heads of government and officials, including the Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Portugal and the Netherlands, and the President of the European Parliament.

Like the others, she mostly wore a mask except when sitting, and appeared to be observing adequate social distancing. The sprawling summit round table was generously spaced, and a few leaders could be seen washing their hands with gel as they entered. The usual hugs and kisses so common last year were replaced by elbow bumps.

French President Emmanuel Macron notably engaged in a close-contact talk with Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who is also representing Poland because its Premier, Mateusz Morawiecki is under quarantine after coming into contact with a coronavirus-infected bodyguard. A first test showed Mr. Morawiecki was not infected. He was to take another test later on Thursday.

Since the pandemic first surfaced in Europe in February, EU leaders have held several summits via videoconference. But they held their last meeting in person just two weeks ago. Officials say it’s often the only way to get really sensitive business done. However, not everyone was happy about traveling back to Brussels so soon.

“This summit should be held as a video conference. I have on several occasions proposed holding video conferences instead of meeting in person,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters on arrival in Brussels. There are some discussions where one needs to be brought a little closer to each other.

And then there are other meetings where you can do it as a video conference. Tackling the pandemic — to be debated on Friday — post-Brexit trade talks with Britain, climate change and EU-Africa relations are the main items on the agenda.

The question remains whether this might be the last in-person meeting for a while if the coronavirus continues to spread at rates not seen for months. The next official summit in Brussels is scheduled for December 10-11. On Thursday, the European Parliament said its next plenary session scheduled next week in the French city of Strasbourg would be held remotely.

Parliament President David Sassoli said the virus has already infected a number of EU lawmakers, staffers and their associates. Traveling is very dangerous. The situation in Strasbourg is critical and in Brussels it’s very serious, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kpm9cp/article32867446.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-URSULAVONDERLEYEN-AP-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/european-union-chief-self-isolates-as-virus-makes-its-mark-at-a-summit/article32867447.ece
33,2020/10/16,Biden campaign finds third virus link; Harris suspends travel,"Mr. Biden is not altering his public schedule, his campaign said on October 15

At least three people connected to Joe Biden’s presidential campaign have tested positive for the coronavirus, leading the campaign to suspend in-person events for vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris through Monday.

Mr. Biden is not altering his public schedule, his campaign said on Thursday, because he had no direct exposure to the individuals who tested positive, as defined by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

It’s the Biden campaign’s first major coronavirus scare, after months of safety precautions that drew mockery from President Donald Trump, even after he, First Lady Melania Trump and others contracted the virus themselves. The Democratic campaign’s cautious reaction underscores the differences in how the rival camps have approached the pandemic, both in terms of preferred government response and in the candidates’ personal protocols.

Mr. Biden’s campaign announced two positive cases on Thursday morning, identifying Ms. Harris’ communications director Liz Allen and an unnamed member of the flight crew for one of Ms. Harris’ recent campaign trips. The campaign announced a third case on Thursday afternoon as part of its contact tracing efforts from the first two cases.

The third individual is an aviation company employee who was on Mr. Biden’s plane for trips to Ohio and Florida earlier this week but who entered the back of the plane and sat far away from Mr. Biden, according to the campaign.

Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden, meanwhile, spent several hours campaigning together in Arizona on Oct. 8, when the first two people who tested positive were on a flight with Ms. Harris. Both candidates have tested negative for the coronavirus multiple times since then, including on Thursday. Everyone on the Biden campaign plane is required to wear a mask.

Mr. Trump, speaking without a mask at a crowded outdoor rally in North Carolina on Thursday afternoon, offered his best wishes to Ms. Harris and reiterated his scepticism of wearing masks.

“We worry about her. I’m very concerned about her, he said, later adding: Masks, no masks, everything, you can do all you want, but you know, you still need help.” The travel suspension interrupts the Biden campaign’s aggressive push across a wide battleground map, including North Carolina and Ohio, with less than three weeks to go until Election Day.

Ms. Harris was set to encourage early voting on Thursday in North Carolina. Her Friday trip to Cleveland would have been her first to Ohio as the vice presidential nominee and would have taken her into the metropolitan area with the state’s largest concentration of Black voters.

Ms. Harris will continue virtual campaigning, including fundraisers previously scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

The senator’s brief hiatus from the trail comes as Mr. Trump ramps up his own travel after he, the First Lady, his campaign manager and several White House staffers contracted the virus.

Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon told reporters on Thursday morning that under CDC guidelines, there was no need for the candidates to quarantine, although she said Ms. Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, would suspend travel for several days out of an abundance of caution.

Neither of these individuals had any contact with Mr. Biden, with Sen. Ms. Harris or any other staff member since testing positive or in the 48-hour period prior to their positive test results, Ms. O’Malley Dillon said.

Ms. Harris followed up in a statement saying “she’d be transparent with you about any test results that I do receive. In the meantime, remember: wear a mask, practice social distancing, and wash your hands regularly. It is possible to stop the spread”. Ms. O’Malley Dillon announced the third case late on Thursday afternoon. She said Mr. Biden’s medical advisers recommended against a quarantine because of the distance between Mr. Biden and the third individual who tested positive.

Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden spent several hours together on Oct. 8 through multiple campaign stops, private meetings and a joint appearance in front of reporters at an airport. They were masked at all times in public, and aides said they were masked in private, as well, including on all flights.

Mr. Biden will attend an ABC News town hall on Thursday airing live at 8 p.m. EDT, and he will proceed with his planned travel Friday and through the weekend.

Ms. O’Malley Dillon said all campaign staff members on the Oct. 8 flight have been tested at least twice since then. All tests have been negative, she said.

The campaign became aware of the first two positive tests on Wednesday night, Ms. O’Malley Dillon said. Ms. Harris had opted earlier this week to attend virtually — rather than in person — the Senate Judiciary Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett, after some of her GOP Senate colleagues tested positive for the coronavirus or disclosed their exposure to others who had tested positive.

Biden’s campaign has taken the coronavirus seriously, drawing mockery from Mr. Trump and Republicans, even as the White House deals with the fallout of its virus outbreak.

The Democratic ticket’s campaign events are socially distanced and require participants to wear masks. Staff often set chairs inside white plastic circles to denote 6 feet (1.8 metres) of distance. During a recent indoor speech at a North Carolina event for Ms. Harris, reporters were given and asked to wear KN95 masks.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/934www/article32867415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-BIDEN-HARRIS-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/biden-campaign-finds-third-virus-link-harris-suspends-travel/article32867416.ece
34,2020/10/16,"Militants ambush oil convoy in Pakistan, kill 14 people","Militants ambushed a convoy of oil and gas workers escorted by paramilitary troops in Pakistan’s restive southwestern province of Baluchistan, killing 14 people, including 7 soldiers.

The attack was carried out on October 15 on the state-run Oil & Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL) workers in Ormara town in Gwadar district.

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of the Pakistan Army, confirmed that the militants had also sustained heavy losses in the exchange of fire and seven Frontier Corps (FC) soldiers and seven private security guards were killed in the attack.

“The terrorists attacked the convoy from the mountains near Ormara on the Balochistan-Hub-Karachi coastal highway and heavy exchange of fire took place. The convoy was returning to Karachi from Gwadar,” a top police official in Gwadar said.

He said it was a planned attack and the militants had prior information about the convoy going to Karachi.

“They were waiting for the convoy. Despite the FC and security guards losing their lives, the other FC personnel managed to safely get the convoy away from the spot near Oramara,” the official said.

Gwadar port is the focal point of the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) development projects and a number of officials of the state-owned institutions and foreigners work at the port city under heavy security cover.

The ISPR, without giving the exact numbers, said a large number of terrorists had attacked the convoy.

“Security forces responded effectively, ensured security of the OGDCL persons and managed their safe exit from the area,” it said in a statement, adding that “substantial losses were also incurred to the terrorists” during the exchange of fire.

According to the ISPR, the security forces have cordoned off the entire area and a search was underway for the militants involved in the attack.

No banned separatist or terrorist outfit or group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the attack and sought a report into the incident, the Radio Pakistan said.

The Premier expressed grief with the families over the death of personnel of security agencies.

Separatist and terror outfits operating in the restive province of Baluchistan regularly carry out attacks on security installations and security personnel.

On October 14, at least 10 people — seven labourers and three children — were injured when suspected militants lobbed a hand grenade at labourers working at an under construction bridge in the Samungli area on the outskirts of the capital city, Quetta.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/militants-ambush-oil-convoy-in-pakistan-kill-14-people/article32867292.ece
35,2020/10/16,‘Jagged Little Pill’ musical leads Tony nominations with 15 nods,"The stage adaptation of Alanis Morissette’s album “Jagged Little Pill,” led nominations for the annual Tony Awards on Thursday

The stage adaptation of Alanis Morissette’s album “Jagged Little Pill,” led nominations for the annual Tony Awards on Thursday although Broadway theatres remain dark in a prolonged pandemic shutdown until summer of 2021.

“Jagged Little Pill,” inspired by the Canadian-born singer’s best-selling 1995 album, got 15 nominations including best musical and nods for six of its actors including star Elizabeth Stanley.

The rock musical, whose themes include sexual assault, drug addiction and female empowerment, opened on Broadway in December 2019, but like all live shows in New York City was forced to close in mid-March as the coronavirus pandemic hit the city. The Broadway closure was extended last week to June 2021.

The pandemic also postponed the annual Tony Awards, which usually take place in June. The shortened Broadway season meant a reduced number of Tony nominations on Thursday and a new date for the awards ceremony, which is expected to be mostly virtual, has yet to be announced.

“Moulin Rouge! The Musical,” based on the 2001 movie by Baz Luhrmann, got 14 Tony nominations on Thursday, including best musical.

“At such a difficult time for so many people, including the thousands who make up the industry behind the scenes, we welcome this opportunity to take a moment to celebrate the remarkable achievements of our finest artists,” Carmen Pavlovic, producer of “Moulin Rouge! The Musical,” said in a statement.

“Slave Play,” about sex, race and inter-racial relationships, got 12 nods, setting a record for the most nominations for a stage play in Broadway history.

“The Inheritance,” a two-part play about gay culture in New York a generation after the AIDS epidemic, got 11 nods.

Broadway has attracted some of Hollywood’s biggest stars in recent years. Nominations on Thursday went to Jake Gyllenhaal (”Sea Wall/A Life”), Tom Hiddleston (”Betrayal”), and Laura Linney (”My Name is Lucy Barton”).",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/yoqgrk/article32869708.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TONYNOMINATIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/jagged-little-pill-musical-leads-tony-nominations-with-15-nods/article32869709.ece
36,2020/10/16,A virtual evening of art and music,"The Desai Foundation brought together music, art and more at its Lotus Festival

What do the works of SH Raza, a community programme for children’s health, the stars of Netflix reality show Indian Matchmaking, and the musician who pioneered Bhangra music in North America have in common? One evening, and a fundraising effort.

The US-based Desai Foundation is known for its fundraising events in different cities around that country, raising money for menstrual health and employment programmes that it conducts both in the US and in rural India. At the first virtual edition of its Lotus Festival recently, among the highlights was — and continues to be — a silent, online auction. Still underway, the auction comprises works of famous artists like MF Husain and Sh Raza, the services of famous chefs, holiday getaways and more. But for foundation President Megha Desai, the items linked directly to their grassroots-level social work — training women to make face masks and clothes; imparting menstrual hygiene education, distributing masks, sanitary napkins and more — hold more signifance than the more glittering items.

“It’s the [Foundation’s] work that I have always held most dear — so when people want to invest in a specific programme, whether it be the Asani Sanitary Napkin programme, our vocational programmes, or our health and hygiene programmes, it’s a great validation that we are doing something that matters to people,” she says via email, adding, “Despite COVID restrictions, we’ve recently expanded our work to Uttar Pradesh, in addition to Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra, and we were so happy to be able to celebrate that with the donors that make that work possible.”

The event also featured celebrity appearances, including an address by DJ Rekha, founder of Basement Bhangra and pioneer of the merging of Bhangra and Bollywood sounds with electronic dance music or EDM. Rekha has been vocal and active about social causes in the past as well, and says in an email interview: “I think it is important for all humans to fight injustice. As artists some of us have the privilege and duty to use our platforms to amplify inequality, systemic oppression among other things.”

Rekha, who has been hosting live music sets online during these months of social distancing, finds that virtual events have an appeal of their own: “Accessing the vibe when spinning live is essential. Doing livestream sets, a different kind of intimacy is created. The camera is close up on you and people are commenting in real time from all over the world. It gives the feeling of a global dancefloor.”

37,2020/10/16,To Kumbakonam we go,"My father turned out to be the moderate face of unreason, while my mother was the radical fringe

It was a beautiful Delhi morning like any other. The sun was rising, birds were singing, uncles were laughing in the park like Ravana. I was sitting on the terrace with my coffee and newspapers, and, like every morning, getting rapidly depressed by the headlines.

I was about to jump off the balcony when my phone rang. I thought if I jumped, I would have to die without ever knowing who the loser was calling me at six in the morning. So, I decided to take the call first.

“Hello! Myself Mr. Thirugnanasambandham,” said a voice I’ve never heard before. “My father used to be deputy assistant branch manager of the Kumbakonam branch of Bank of India.”

“Oh no, no, no. You have the wrong number,” I said. “I am not Mathrubootham.”

“Sir, I know who you are,” he said. “Are you not the son of Kattabomman’s grandfather?”

“Am I the son of…?” It took me a minute to work that out. “Oh yes, I am the same.”

“In that case, talk to him,” he said. “Tell him not to travel. It’s a needless risk.”

“What?”

“I’m getting married next week.”

“Congratulations,” I said. “But what’s it got to do with my father?”

“You see, my father met your father 30 years ago at the Mandaveli branch of Bank of India when he was posted there. So, out of courtesy, he sent your father an e-invitation for my wedding. But to our shock, your father has replied saying he’s coming from Chennai to Kumbakonam to attend, and bringing missus also.”

“I see.”

“Not a good idea,” he said. “Given that they are elderly people.”

“Mr. Thirugnanasambandham,” I sighed. “Thank you for this call. But why in Guruvayoorappa’s name did you have to send them an invitation? And why are you getting married in the middle of a raging pandemic?”

“It wasn’t my idea,” he began, and gave a long-winded explanation that went on for 15 minutes. The gist of it was that it was now up to me to coax two headstrong senior citizens into doing the right thing — that is, stay put at home.

Calling father

I got father and mother on a conference call. As I had feared, they had already made travel arrangements and even booked a hotel in Kumbakonam.

“Have you guys caught madness?” I screamed. “Both of you are in your 70s. You belong to the age bracket that’s widely acknowledged as the favourite cuisine of the Coronavirus. Taken together, the two of you have enough co-morbidities to keep every specialist fully occupied in a multispecialty hospital!”

My father is generally open to reason, but on this issue, he turned out to be the moderate face of unreason, while my mother was the radical fringe.

“We will be careful-da,” Appa said. “Don’t make mountain out of molagapodi.”

“But why is it so important to attend this wedding?” I wailed. “You hardly even know the man. I’ve never heard you mention this Kumbakonam fellow before!”

“You’ve forgotten?” Appa was indignant. “He is the one who helped you redeem your PPF after you lost the pass book.”

“Wonderful. Just because a bank clerk helped you with a transaction in the previous century, you want to put yourself, your wife, your children and grandchildren at risk?”

I’ll go when I am ready

“Ennada risku?” my mother burst out. “Do you know the risk of mental illness when someone’s stuck at home for seven bloody months? You think it’s better I die of depression than of corona?”

“Don’t do melodrama bringing up irrelevant topics like death.” I said. “I’m only talking of COVID precautions.”

“Aaamaan, periya precaution,” Amma said. “I’ll go when I have to go. Nobody can stop it when the time comes.”

“Kaadu is saying come, come, residence is saying go, go,” Appa said.

“This dialogue is way past its expiry date,” I said. “Firstly, there are no more forests left in India. Secondly, it’s not kaadu but corona that’s saying come-come, come to Kumbakonam.”

Then father played his trump card. “Even if I agree not to go, your mother won’t budge.”

“No point in going anymore,” I said. “I’ve already told the groom you guys are not coming. Your names have been struck off the guest list.”

“Who cares?” Amma said. “I want to see Kumbakonam. I’ve never been there.”

I had anticipated this. Mother was always the more adamant one, and also the bigger medical risk. Last December, her sugar level had breached Kapil Dev’s Test wickets tally. After the doctor gave her a dressing down, she became slightly more disciplined with her medication. But her fasting sugar, which should ideally have been Venkatesh Prasad, still hovers between the Test tallies of Ishant Sharma and Chaminda Vaas.

“Amma, this is Kumbakonam we are talking about, not Kathmandu,” I said. “There is nothing to see there.”

“My decision is final,” she said. “We are going. If nothing, we’ll visit the Kumbakonam branch of Bank of India and come back.”

HCL Technologies on Friday said its net profit for the second quarter ended September 2020 grew 18.5% to ₹3,124 crore driven by a push for digitisation. The company said it planned to implement salary increments in addition to a “significant number of hirings” during the current year.

The company’s revenues grew 6.1% to ₹18,594 crore during the quarter.

“We delivered a solid performance in Q2... Our stellar performance is broad-based across verticals, service lines, geographies and Mode 1, 2, 3 offerings,” president and CEO C. Vijayakumar said in a virtual briefing. “Our new bookings remained very robust, it increased 35% compared to the last quarter. We won 15 transformational deals,” he said. Mr. Vijayakumar added that the company’s deal pipeline grew 20% quarter-on-quarter, which was “an all-time high”.

One of the main elements that contributed to the ‘brilliant performance’ was the intensity of the technology spent as companies recalibrate businesses and business models for the new normal, he said.

44,2020/10/16,India fares poorly in hunger index,"Country has the highest prevalence of ‘wasted children’; even Bangladesh and Pakistan score better

India has the highest prevalence of wasted children under five years in the world, which reflects acute undernutrition, according to the Global Hunger Index 2020. The situation has worsened in the 2015-19 period, when the prevalence of child wasting was 17.3%, in comparison to 2010-14, when it was 15.1%.

Overall, India ranks 94 out of 107 countries in the Index, lower than neighbours such as Bangladesh (75) and Pakistan (88). 2020 scores reflect data from 2015-19. The Index, which was released on Friday, is a peer-reviewed report released annually by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.

It uses four parameters to determine its scores. India fares worst in child wasting (low weight for height, reflecting acute undernutrition) and child stunting (low height for age, reflecting chronic undernutrition), which together make up a third of the total score.

Although it is still in the poorest category, however, child stunting has actually improved significantly, from 54% in 2000 to less than 35% now. Child wasting, on the other hand, has not improved in the last two decades, and is rather worse than it was decade ago.

India has improved in both child mortality rates, which are now at 3.7%, and in terms of undernourishment, with about 14% of the total population which gets an insufficient caloric intake.

In the region of south, east and south-eastern Asia, the only countries which fare worse than India are Timor-Leste, Afghanistan and North Korea.

Pandemic effect

Globally, nearly 690 million people are undernourished, according to the report, which warns that the COVID-19 pandemic could have affected the progress made on reducing hunger and poverty.

“The world is not on track to achieve the second Sustainable Development Goal — known as Zero Hunger for short — by 2030. At the current pace, approximately 37 countries will fail even to reach low hunger, as defined by the Global Hunger Index Severity Scale, by 2030,” says the report. “These projections do not account for the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may worsen hunger and undernutrition in the near term and affect countries’ trajectories into the future ... COVID-19 has made it clearer than ever that our food systems, as they stand, are inadequate to the task of achieving Zero Hunger.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article19752955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26TH-MALNUTRITION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-fares-poorly-in-hunger-index/article32876195.ece
45,2020/10/16,"ED attaches assets worth ₹122.15 crore of Deccan Chronicle, two promoters","The 14 properties attached under PMLA are located in Delhi, Gurugram, Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru

The Enforcement Directorate has attached assets worth ₹122.15 crore of Deccan Chronicle Holdings Limited (DCHL), two of its former promoters, T. Venkatram Reddy and T. Vinayakravi Reddy, and a benami firm allegedly floated by them. The total attachment in the case now stands at ₹264.56 crore.

The 14 properties attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) are located in Delhi, Gurugram, Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru and other places. “All these attached assets are not covered under the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) process,” the agency said in a release on Friday.

The agency said the total loan fraud allegedly committed by DCHL and its promoters was estimated to be ₹8,180 crore. DCHL is currently under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), in which a resolution plan for only ₹400 crore has been approved by the NCLT.

Six FIRs

The ED probe was initiated in 2015, based on six FIRs and the corresponding chargesheets filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation. The SEBI has also filed a prosecution against DCHL.

According to the agency, the three promoters of DCHL — P. K. Iyer, Mr. Venkatram Reddy and Mr. Vinayakravi Reddy — manipulated the company’s balance sheets to inflate profits-advertisement revenue and grossly under-stated its financial liabilities for years to cheat the banks and its shareholders.

Over the years, DCHL availed itself of credit facilities to the tune of more than ₹15,000 crore. Most of the loans were cyclically rotated into group companies and diverted to repay previous borrowings, as alleged.

The accused promoters received hefty kickbacks from the investment made by DCHL in Odyssey at highly inflated values.

The agency alleged that despite the initiation of CIRP process, the accused promoters and their close family members continued to wield indirect control over the print media and were working in senior capacities, drawing large salaries.

“The promoters were also found to be re-purchasing the mortgaged assets at discounted rates through private treaties by using concealed proceeds of crime through front company,” the ED said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/nh74d3/article32876991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DCHL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-attaches-assets-worth-12215-crore-of-deccan-chronicle-two-promoters/article32876131.ece

Akanksha Singh of Delhi and Soyeb Aftab of Odisha both scored an unprecedented 100% score in the NEET examination, with Mr. Aftab snagging the All India number one ranking, according to the tie-breaking policy, as he is the older student. This is the first time a perfect score has been achieved in NEET, according to the National Testing Agency which conducts the examination.

They topped the list of the more than 7.7 lakh students who qualified for medical and dental counselling in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), this year. With the COVID-19 pandemic causing disruptions and delays, only 13.6 lakh students attempted the examination this year, despite being given two chances to do so. This is lower than last year’s 14.1 lakh candidates, although this year’s original registrations were actually higher.

Cut-offs were higher across the board, with general category students facing a cut-off score of 147, higher than last year’s 134. For general category students from economically weaker sections, the cut-off is 129, while all other reserved categories students had a cut-off of 113.

Among states, the highest qualifying percentages were in Chandigarh and Delhi ( both above 75%) and Haryana (almost 73%).

Tamil Nadu continued to see significant improvements in performance, with a qualifying percentage of more than 57%. This is a leap from 48.6% last year and a huge spike from 2018, when it had one of the lowest qualifying percentages of 39.6%. Although the Tamil Nadu government has strongly opposed the introduction of NEET and fought a long, losing battle against it in court, it had also run free special coaching classes to help state board students meet the exam’s standards.

Andhra Pradesh, on the other hand, saw its qualifying rates drop from almost 71% last year to less than 59% this year.

There were four women in the top ten all India ranking list, but only 13 in the top 50. Although male candidates continued to dominate the top rankings, almost 4.3 lakh women qualified for counselling, in comparison to 3.4 lakh men.

This is the first time that admissions to MBBS courses in elite institutions such as AIIMS and JIPMER will also be made through NEET, following an amendment in the National Medical Commission Act last year.

Due to COVID-19, the examination that was originally supposed to be held in May was postponed to September. As students who tested positive for COVID or lived in containment zones were not allowed to write the examination then, they were given another chance in October. Masks, sanitisers and social distancing were compulsory elements of the examination experience for this year’s medical aspirants.

Prof G.N. Saibaba, who is lodged at the anda cell of Nagpur Central jail after being convicted for maoist links, is said to go on a hunger strike from October 21 as he is not been provided with clothes, medicines and books since a month. Prof. Saibaba, a polio victim, is 90% physically disabled and wheel chair bound, and suffers from pancreatitis, high blood pressure, cardiomyopathy, and chronic back pain.

“Saibaba has been denied reading material, medicines and clothes,” alleges his wife A.S Vasantha Kumari. She said, “Saibaba who is lodged in jail since 2014 has been denied all basic human rights where he is not given any letters or allowed any phone calls from me since over a month.”

Advocate Aakash Sarode who regularly delivers medicines, clothes and other essentials to Prof. Saibaba told The Hindu, “Last month I got a shirt, under garments, medicines, four books and two notepads for him in the jail. However none of it was taken by the prison authorities, without giving any reason for the same. I went back again two weeks back but they refused to take anything I got. I will try going once again before October 21.”

Ms Vasantha Kumari has also written letters to the Maharashtra Additional Director General of Prisons Sunil Ramanand and the Superintendent of Prisons (SP) Nagpur Anupkumar Kumre about “the hardships and harassment Saibaba faces in jail and is subjected to unfair restrictions.”

Mr Kumre confirmed that Prof. Saibaba will be going on hunger strike from October 21 and said, “It is a 200% baseless allegation that Saibaba is not provided with any medicines, books and clothes. Due to coronavirus we have stopped taking newspapers in jail since March but other than that books and letters are given to him after we go through them and decide on what is “right” and needs to be given to him.”

When asked, what considered “right”, Mr Kumre said, “The administration (which includes the SP, Additional SP and another prison official) verifies the books and sees if they are “nice”. Something on Gandhiji, or a freedom fighter, a story book or any mythological book is usually allowed. A magazine or any other reading matter has to be “correct” for the inmate. As far as clothes are concerned, due to corona virus we have stopped allowing any civil clothes inside the jail as it spreads the virus.”

Assets worth over ₹122 crore belonging to Deccan Chronicle Holdings Limited (DCHL) and its former promoters have been attached under the anti-money laundering law in connection with an alleged bank loan fraud case, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said on Friday.

A total of 14 properties located in New Delhi, Hyderabad, Gurgaon, Chennai, Bangalore and a few other places that belong to DCHL, its former promoters T Venkatram Reddy and T Vinayakravi Reddy and that of a benami company “floated by them” have been attached, the central probe agency said in a statement.

The company at present is under corporate insolvency resolution process but the attached properties are not covered under the process being adjudicated by the national company law tribunal (NCLT), the agency claimed.

A resolution plan for only ₹400 crore has been approved by the NCLT. The total loan fraud committed by DCHL and its promoters is estimated to be at ₹8,180 crore, it claimed.

The agency claimed its probe found that “the three promoters of DCHL namely P K Iyer, T Venkatram Reddy and T Vinayakravi Reddy hatched a well planned conspiracy and manipulated the balance sheets of the company inflating the profits-advertisement revenue and grossly understated the financial liabilities of the company to paint a rosy picture for years to cheat the banks and its shareholders.”

“Despite the initiation of the insolvency resolution process, the accused promoters and their close family members continue to yield indirect control over the print media and are working in senior capacities drawing large monthly salaries,” the ED claimed.

It said balance sheets of the company were fudged and loans taken from one bank were hidden from other financial institutions.

“Over the years, DCHL availed credit facilities to the tune of more than ₹15,000 crore. Money trail investigation revealed that most of the loans were cyclically rotated into group companies and were diverted to pay back older loans.”

“Loans taken for working capital requirements and for business needs of DCHL were diverted to extravagant projects and the diverted funds which were so invested into new projects without the consent of the banks and were ultimately shown as losses,” it claimed.

Substantial amounts out of the loans were diverted into subsidiaries which have not done any legitimate business and also into the proprietary concerns of the two ex-promoters without any proper accounting, the ED claimed.

“The accused promoters received hefty kickbacks from the investment made by DCHL into Odyssey (a company) at highly inflated values. The promoters ran the public listed company DCHL like their proprietary fiefdom throwing all norms of corporate governance to wind,” it claimed.

It claimed probe found there were many “suspicious” donations to various trusts.

“The promoters were also found to be re-purchasing the mortgaged assets at discounted rates through private treaties by using concealed proceeds of crime through front company. The net amount of loss caused to the banks/NBFCs/financial institutions is estimated at ₹8,180 crore including the unpaid principal loan amount of approximately of ₹3,000 crore,” it claimed.

So far, it said, assets totalling ₹264.56 crore have been identified and provisionally attached by the ED under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in this case.

A local court in Mathura on Friday admitted a plea that seeks to remove a mosque adjacent to the Krishna Janmabhoomi.

The court of District Judge Sadhna Rani Thakur has fixed November 18 as the next date of hearing in the case.

Earlier, a civil court in Mathura had dismissed the plea seeking an order to remove the Shahi Idgah mosque. In her September 30 order, Judge Chhaya Sharma had said that Lord Krishna had countless devotees but if each devotee was allowed to file a suit like this, it would jeopardise the judicial and social system.

Hari Shankar Jain, the lawyer for the petitioners, said Judge Thakur observed that in case the trustees were not approaching the court, the devotees could.

He maintained the Place of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 did not apply to the case.

The suit is filed by Lucknow-based advocate Ranjana Agnihotri and seven others on behalf of the child deity Bhagwan Shri Krishna Virajman. The U.P. Sunni Central Waqf Board and the Committee of Management of Trust of Shahi Idgah have been arraigned as defendants in the suit, along with Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Trust, Mathura, and Shri Krishna Janma Sthan Seva Sansthan.

The violent clashes on the India-China border in June had a very deep public and political impact and has left the relationship profoundly disturbed , External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on Friday.

Mr. Jaishankar, speaking at a virtual event hosted by the Asia Society, said that India has built the relationship with China over the course of last 30 years and a basis for building that relationship has been peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control.

He said there are multiple agreements, starting from 1993, which created the framework for that peace and tranquillity, which limited the military forces that came to the border areas, how to manage the border, how border troops behave when they approach each other.

“So, from the conceptual level down to the behavioural level, there was an entire sort of framework out there. Now, what we saw this year was a departure from this entire series of agreements. The massing of large amount of Chinese forces on the border was clearly contrary to all of this.

“And when you had friction point which was large number of troops at different points very close to each other, then something tragic like what happened on 15th of June happened,” he said.

“To underline the enormity of that, it was the first military casualty we had after 1975. So what it has done is, it has obviously had a very deep public impact, very major political impact and it has left the relationship profoundly disturbed,” Mr. Jaishankar said.

Mr. Jaishankar said that apart from the Wuhan Summit in April 2018, there was a similar summit in Chennai last year and the idea of the summit was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping spend time, talk to each other directly about their concerns.

“What happened this year of course was a very sharp departure. Now it’s not just a sharp departure from the conversation, it’s a sharp departure over a course of relationship over 30 years,” he said.

In response to a question on what did the Chinese actually do on the border and why they did it, Mr. Jaishankar said, “I haven’t frankly got any reasonable explanation that I can tell myself from them on this matter.

“There are today a very large number of troops with weapons concentrated on that segment of the border and that is obviously a very critical security challenge that we face.”

Terrorism remains publicly acknowledged by the Pakistan government as a policy that they justify, making it very hard to conduct normal relations with it, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on Friday.

Speaking during an online event hosted by the Asia Society, Mr. Jaishankar said, “In terms of your question, how are we with Pakistan. Well, I am afraid we’re still at the, if not the perennial issues, at least the long-lasting ones, which is terrorism from Pakistan continues.”

“Terrorism from Pakistan remains publicly acknowledged by their government as a policy that they are justifying. So it makes it very hard to conduct normal relations with them,” Mr. Jaishankar said.

He added that it is not only terrorism, but Pakistan doesn’t do normal trade with India and has not given New Delhi MFN (Most Favoured Nation) status.

“We don’t have a normal visa relationship, they are very restrictive on that score. They have blocked connectivity between India and Afghanistan and from Afghanistan to India,” he said.

Mr. Jaishankar said that “normal neighbours do visas and trade, they give you connectivity and most important they don’t practice terrorism. And I think until we address that problem, this challenge of how do you have a normal relationship with this very unique neighbour is a very troubling issue for our foreign policy.”

Responding to a question on the developments in Kashmir since the bifurcation last year, Mr. Jaishankar said the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir has now become two Union Territories.

“The external boundaries of India have not changed. The external boundaries of India remain what they are today as opposed to what they were five years ago or 20 years ago, 40 years ago,” he said.

Also read: India to protest Pakistan claims on terror at U.N.

“So as far as our neighbours are concerned, our point to them is that this is something which is internal to us. Every country after all reserves the right to change its administrative jurisdictions. A country like China has also changed the borders of its provinces and I’m sure a lot of other countries do that.

“Neighbours get impacted only if your external boundaries change. That has not happened in this case,” he said.

Ties between India and Pakistan nosedived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country. Subsequent attacks, including one on Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.

The relationship further dipped after India’s war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26 last year in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.

After the Union government agreed to borrow ₹1.10 lakh crore on behalf of States to meet the GST shortfall, Congress leader P. Chidambaram said Friday that the Centre has taken the “correct first step” and it should now work to re-establish trust with them.

“I welcomed the change of heart,” he tweeted and asked the Centre to clarify how the debt of states will be serviced and repaid.

“Having taken the correct first step, I urge the PM and the FM to take the second step also and re-establish the trust between the Centre and the States,” the former Finance Minister said on Twitter.

He said Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has written to the States that the central government will borrow ₹1,10,208 crore and give them “back-to-back loans”.

“There is no clarity on the balance of the gap in the GST compensation. FM’s letter puts the number at ₹1,06,830 crore for this financial year. There is no clarity on who will borrow the money and no clarity on how the debt will be serviced and repaid.

“States are opposed to borrowing on their own account. States are right. There is no difference between the first amount and the second amount,” Mr. Chidambaram said.

He asked the Centre to resolve the impasse immediately by offering the same terms for ₹1,06,830 crore as it has now offered for ₹1,10,208 crore.

On Thursday, the central government announced that it will borrow up to ₹1.10 lakh crore on behalf of the states to bridge the shortfall in GST collections.

A slowdown in the economy since last fiscal has resulted in a drop in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections, upsetting the budgets of states which had given up their right to levy local taxes such as sales tax or VAT when GST was introduced in July 2017.

To make up for the shortfall, borrowing from the market was proposed but non-BJP States refused to accept the proposal and asked the Centre to borrow instead.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ajt7vq/article32847238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14CHIDAMBARAMNEWS3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-should-now-work-to-re-establish-trust-with-states-chidambaram-on-gst-row/article32873471.ece
57,2020/10/16,CBI and U.S. Justice Dept. identify assets of firms involved in fraud,"The searches were spread across various locations including Jaipur, Delhi, Noida, Gurugram, Faridabad & Mainpuri

The Central Bureau of Investigation, in an operation conducted in coordination with the U.S. Department of Justice against six firms that were involved in cheating hundreds of elderly and vulnerable people in the U.S., has detected assets worth over ₹190 crore linked to the accused persons.

“The CBI is collaborating with its counterparts in other countries to identify the network, dismantle their infrastructure and bring the perpetrators of crime to justice,” it said.

The agency said, “The U.S. Department of Justice and the CBI collaborated in this regard, and on Thursday, the U.S. Federal court ordered an individual and five companies to stop engaging in the technical-support fraud scheme that is alleged to have defrauded hundreds of elderly and vulnerable U.S. victims.”

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the accused from Glendale in California, knowingly provided support to the India-based accomplices and facilitated the scheme through several companies, including in Singapore.

“The temporary restraining order issued by the U.S. court dismantles these defendants’ U.S. infrastructure, such as websites and payment processing relationships, and prohibits the defendants from continuing to facilitate the alleged scheme,” the CBI said.

During the recent searches in Delhi, Jaipur, Noida, Gurugram, Faridabad and Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh, the agency seized digital evidence and also identified bank accounts and fixed deposits to the tune of ₹190 crore. It also seized about ₹25 lakh in cash and gold worth ₹55 lakh.

The accused companies were identified as Softwill Infotech Private Limited and Saburi TLC Worldwide Services Private Limited in Delhi; InnovanaThinklabs Limited and Systweak Software Private Limited in Jaipur; Saburi Global Services Private Limited in Gurugram; and Benovellient Technologies Private Limited in Noida.

Internet messages

“It was alleged that these companies would contact the victims via Internet pop-up messages that falsely appeared to be security alerts from Microsoft or any other well-known company,” said the agency.

Through the message, the accused would fraudulently claim that the consumer’s computer security had been compromised as it was infected by a virus. It would run a scan through the system, falsely confirming the presence of a virus and malware.

The message would display a toll free number for technical assistance. Distress calls from the potential victims would land at the call centres run by the accused persons. The companies would then remotely access the victims’ computers and make the callers believe that there was indeed an issue.

The victims would pay up hundreds of dollars for the technical services and software packages on the promise of fixing non-existing problems. Several irrelevant software packages developed by the accused companies are being examined.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/u2cgyc/article32873337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-stock-cbi-investigation,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cbi-searches-6-firms-targeting-computer-users-through-tech-support-scam-190-crore-assets-seized/article32873453.ece

Vice Chief of the Army Staff Lt Gen S K Saini will embark on a four-day visit to the U.S. beginning on Saturday to explore ways to further deepen military cooperation between the two countries.

The visit comes ahead of the third edition of the two-plus-two dialogue between India and the U.S. which is slated to be held in India later this month.

The Army said Lt Gen Saini will visit the U.S. Army’s Pacific Command (USARPRAC) and exchange ideas with the military leadership there.

“The Vice Chief of the Army Staff will visit the U.S. Army Pacific Command (USARPRAC), the Army component of Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) and exchange ideas extensively with the military leadership apart from witnessing training and equipment capabilities of the US Army,” the Army said in a statement.

“The Vice Chief of the Army Staff will also visit INDOPACOM where aspects of military cooperation and furthering military to military engagement including procurements, training in niche domains, joint exercises and capability building will be discussed,” it said.

The Army said the visit will further enhance the operational and strategic level collaboration between the two armies.

Indian armed forces are participating in two joint exercises with the U.S. in the coming months despite COVID-19 restrictions.

These are ‘Yudh Abhyas’ and ‘Vajra Prahar’. While ‘Yudh Abhyas’ is scheduled to take place in February next year, ‘Vajra Prahar’ is slated for March.

62,2020/10/16,"Stubble burning | Former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur, aided by students, to save Delhi-NCR","Supreme Court appoints one-man panel to monitor and prevent instances of stubble burning by farmers in U.P., Punjab and Haryana.

Former Supreme Court judge, Justice Madan B. Lokur, helped by student volunteer forces deployed from the National Cadet Corps, the National Service Scheme and the Bharat Scouts and Guides, will protect Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) from pollution caused by stubble-burning in the neighbouring Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh this winter.

A Supreme Court Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde on Friday appointed Justice Lokur as a one-man committee to monitor and prevent instances of stubble-burning by farmers in the three States.

Student forces will patrol highways and fields in the three States and ensure that no fires are started in the fields.

When Haryana counsel protested that these were just schoolchildren, Chief Justice Bobde reacted, “this does not involve a great knowledge of fires... Why can’t the NCC go and see who is lighting the fires?”

The Chief Secretaries of the three States will provide facilities to the committee and provide the student volunteers with adequate transportation to aid their vigil.

Existing mobile teams and nodal officers of the States will report to the committee. The Supreme Court’s own Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) would consult with the committee on issues related to stubble-burning.

The court made it clear to Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati that the formation of the committee was not meant as an adverse comment on the functioning of the EPCA.

The committee will file its status reports with the court at least every fortnight.

Lokur headed Green Bench

The court chose Justice Lokur for the task as he had headed the Green Bench that was monitoring stubble-burning for two whole years before his retirement. His name was recommended by senior advocate Vikas Singh, who is appearing for two children apprehensive of the onslaught of incoming waves of smog caused by unbridled stubble-burning in the three States this winter.

Mr. Singh said the issue was urgent and could not wait till the court reopened after the Dussehra holidays, as pollution may by then have reached “unmanageable proportions”. Stubble fires were five times higher in Punjab in spite of the State using a remote-sensing app. Justice Lokur who was called on telephone during the hearing, immediately agreed to do the job.

Solicitor General’s plea

Minutes after the hearing was over and the Bench was about to rise for the day, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared on the screen to persuade the court to hold its order and wait till after reopening. Mr. Mehta said Justice Lokur need not be troubled and the situation prevailing before the order should continue for now. He said the EPCA was doing a good job. He was, however, hesitant to explain what his reasons were against the formation of the Justice Lokur Committee despite the CJI asking him repeatedly to speak freely.

“We have already passed the order. You cannot come like this, Mr. Mehta. All the parties were represented in the case. We have not given Justice Lokur any extraordinary jurisdiction...”, the CJI addressed Mr. Mehta.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/j69kt0/article32876139.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DELHIAIRPOLLUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-appoints-ex-judge-mb-lokur-as-one-man-panel-to-prevent-stubble-burning/article32870489.ece
63,2020/10/16,"MSP, government procurement key to India’s food security: Narendra Modi","The Prime Minister released a commemorative coin on the 75th anniversary of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated his support for minimum support prices and government procurement of crops, at a time when farmers are protesting against agricultural reforms that they say endangers this existing system.

Speaking at a virtual event to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, Mr. Modi also said the government would soon take a decision on the revising the minimum age of marriage for women.

“MSP and government procurement are an important part of the country’s food security. Therefore, it is important that it should continue to function with better facilities and scientific management. We are committed to this,” said the Prime Minister.

With regard to the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis, he said that system has its own identity and strength.

“In the last six years, more than ₹2,500 crore has been invested to build better infrastructure in these APMC mandis. Hundreds of crores have also been spent to prepare IT infrastructure in these mandis,” Mr. Modi said, adding that the recent reforms aim to make the APMC mandis more competitive.

Earlier this week, Punjab farmer unions walked out of talks with the Agriculture Ministry, vowing to continue their protests and rail blockade against the reforms. They say the recent three laws passed by Parliament last month will weaken the APMC system, and ultimately lead to the phasing out of government procurement at MSP rates while encouraging corporate buyers who will purchase produce at lower rates.

In his speech, the Prime Minister emphasised the government’s view that the reforms would increase farmers’ income. “Small farmers used to sell their produce to middlemen earlier due to lack of access to the mandis. Now, the market itself will reach their doorsteps,” he said. “Every type of protection to the farmer has been ensured through these reforms. When the Indian farmer is empowered, his income will increase, and the campaign against malnutrition will also gain equal strength.”

The Prime Minister also listed lack of education and early pregnancy of girls among the hurdles in the fight against malnutrition. He noted that the gross enrolment ratio of girls has become higher than boys for the first time. Child marriage is among the reasons that girls drop out of school in higher classes, he said.

“Necessary discussion is also going on to decide the right age of marriage of daughters,” said Mr. Modi. A committee of Ministers has been set up to discuss the revision of the minimum age of marriage for women, which is currently at 18 years, while the minimum age for men is 21 years.

Noting that he gets letters from young women across the country asking why the committee's report has not come yet, the PM said, “I assure all those daughters that the government will take action on the report very soon.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5dilbr/article32869886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODIFAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/msp-government-procurement-important-part-of-countrys-food-security-pm-modi/article32869887.ece
64,2020/10/16,SC to seek AG’s views on courts imposing bail conditions for sex crime offenders,"Nine women lawyers brought to court’s attention a bail order passed by Madhya Pradesh HC in a sexual assault case recently which ‘trivialised the victim’s trauma’.

The Supreme Court on Friday decided to seek the views of Attorney General K.K. Venugopal about courts imposing bail conditions for sex crime offenders which end up further harassing, objectifying their victims.

A Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar decided to take into “consideration the position” of Mr. Venugopal, the government’s topmost law officer and constitutional authority, after nine women lawyers brought to the court’s attention a bail order passed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in a sexual assault case recently.

The High Court, as a condition for grant of bail, ordered the accused man to visit his victim at home on ‘Rakshabandhan’ and “allow” her to tie a ‘rakhi’ on him.

The Bench scheduled a hearing on November 2.

The nine lawyers, led by advocate Aparna Bhat and represented by senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, said the High Court order was a “trivialisation of her (victim’s) trauma”.

Mr. Parikh said there were many such instances of court orders which objectified women already traumatised by the crimes committed against them.

The law prescribed the victim to be kept far away from the accused. Instead, here, the Madhya Pradesh High Court had ordered the accused to visit the home of the woman — the very place where the crime was alleged to have occurred.

The petition said the High Court had further ordered the accused to gift the woman ₹11,000 “as a customary ritual usually offered by brothers to sisters on such occasion and shall also seek her blessings”.

It had also ordered the accused to offer ₹5,000 to the woman’s son for the “purchase of clothes and sweets”.

Mr. Parikh said such orders only succeeded in victimising the woman and retard the years of work done to sensitise the courts about how damaging it would be to attempt a compromise “by way of marriage or mediation between the accused and the survivor”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/da5cot/article32869250.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDWOMENLAWYERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-to-seek-ags-views-on-courts-imposing-bail-conditions-for-sex-crime-offenders/article32869251.ece
65,2020/10/16,"India gained decade of life expectancy since 1990, says Lancet study","The study noted that life expectancy in India has risen from 59.6 years in 1990 to 70.8 years in 2019, ranging from 77.3 years in Kerala to 66.9 years in Uttar Pradesh.

India has gained more than a decade of life expectancy since 1990, but there are wide inequalities between States, according to a new study which assessed more than 286 causes of death and 369 diseases and injuries in more than 200 countries and territories across the world.

The study, published in the Lancet journal, noted that life expectancy in India has risen from 59.6 years in 1990 to 70.8 years in 2019, ranging from 77.3 years in Kerala to 66.9 years in Uttar Pradesh.

However, the researchers, including Srinivas Goli from the Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar, said the increase in ‘healthy life expectancy’ in India has not been as dramatic as the growth of life expectancy since “people are living more years with illness and disability”.

According to the international team of scientists, the current global crisis of chronic diseases and failure of public health to stem the rise in highly preventable risk factors such as high blood pressure, tobacco use, and air pollution have left populations vulnerable to acute health emergencies such as COVID-19.

“The main improvement we see in almost every country, including in India, is a decline in infectious diseases and more rise in chronic diseases,” study co-author Ali Mokdad from the University of Washington in the U.S. told PTI.

“In India maternal mortality used to be very high, but now it is coming down. Cardiovascular diseases used to be number five, and now it is number one, and cancer rates are increasing,” Mr. Mokdad, Professor of Global Health at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), said.

While many parts of the world have also controlled infectious diseases through immunisation and better medical care, he said some countries still struggle to manage these epidemics.

“The interaction of COVID-19 with the continued global rise in chronic illness and related risk factors, including obesity, high blood sugar, and outdoor air pollution, over the past 30 years has created a perfect storm, fuelling COVID-19 deaths,” the scientists noted in a statement.

In the South Asia region, they said non-communicable diseases (NCDs) now contribute to more than half of the years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death, which was dominated by infectious, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases 30 years ago.

Citing an example, the researchers said 58% of the total disease burden in India is now due to non-communicable diseases, up from 29% in 1990, while premature deaths due to NCDs have more than doubled from 22 to 50%.

The study found that the largest contributors to increasing health loss in India over the last 30 years were NCDs like ischaemic heart disease, COPD, diabetes, stroke, and a group of musculoskeletal disorders.

In 2019, the research noted that the top five risk factors for death in India were air pollution (contributing to an estimated 1.67 million deaths), high blood pressure (1.47 million), tobacco use (1.23 million), poor diet (1.18 million), and high blood sugar (1.12 million).

The scientists said several of the risk factors and NCDs highlighted by the study, including obesity and diabetes are associated with increased risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19.

They cautioned that urgent action is needed to address the synergistic epidemic of chronic diseases, social inequalities, and COVID-19, referring to the interaction of several epidemics that exacerbate the disease burden in populations who are already burdened.

“Most of these risk factors are preventable and treatable, and tackling them will bring huge social and economic benefits,” said study lead author Christopher Murray, Director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in the U.S.

“We are failing to change unhealthy behaviours, particularly those related to diet quality, caloric intake, and physical activity, in part due to inadequate policy attention and funding for public health and behavioural research,” Mr. Murray said.

Since 1990, the researchers said India has made substantial gains in health, but added that child and maternal malnutrition is still the number-one risk factor for illness and death in India, contributing to more than a fifth of the total disease burden in several states in northern India like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

According to the scientists, high blood pressure is the third leading risk factor after air pollution, responsible for 10-20% of all health loss in eight States in India, primarily in the south.

The researchers stressed that there is overdue recognition of the importance of social and economic development to overall health all over the world.

“Given the overwhelming impact of social and economic development on health progress, doubling down on policies and strategies that stimulate economic growth, expand access to schooling, and improve the status of women, should be our collective priority,” Mr. Murray said in a statement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/uw9vxu/article29840865.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31THHEALTHCAREANDINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-gained-decade-of-life-expectancy-since-1990-says-lancet-study/article32869093.ece

The Ministry of External Affairs, institute of foreign service and the India Foundation on Thursday launched the first edition ‘Sushma Swaraj Lectures’ designed to ‘introduce India’ to foreign diplomats posted here.

Sushma Swaraj (1952 - 2019): A woman of many firsts

The inaugural address of the lectures, named in the memory of former External Affairs Minister Swaraj, was delivered by Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla.

In his address, he sketched the contours of contemporary India around the four Ds -- democracy, development, demography and diversity.

He highlighted the seminal contribution of Swaraj towards making diplomacy responsive to the needs of Indian citizens, whether in India or abroad.

The Indian ethos of ‘dharma’ as defined by emperor Ashoka - “do as little harm as possible, do as much good as possible, be compassionate, be charitable, be good and true” permeates India’s approach in dealing with the current COVID-19 pandemic too, Shringla was quoted as saying by a statement issued by the Sushma Swaraj Institute of Foreign Service.

As pharmacy to the world, India has delivered medicines and medical equipment to over 150 countries, he said.

“India has also committed that our vaccine production and delivery capacity would be used for all humanity in fighting the COVID pandemic,” he said.

“In one of the largest repatriation operations ever, we were able to bring home 1.8 million Indians stuck in far-flung corners of the globe under the Vande Bharat Mission,” Mr. Shringla said.

Sushma Swaraj Institute of Foreign Service (SSIFS), Ministry of External Affairs and the India Foundation are organising the ‘Sushma Swaraj Lectures 2020 on Introduction to India’ on October 15-16.

Forty-five foreign diplomats newly arrived to take up their assignments in missions and international organisations in New Delhi are attending the lectures.

The programme includes an introduction to Indian history, polity, culture, and economy, the statement said.

An eminent list of speakers including members of Parliament, senior government officers and intellectuals/ academics will be addressing the participants, the statement said.

The lectures are aimed at sensitising partner countries to the dynamic and complex Indian polity, economy etc.

Meanwhile at an online media briefing, MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said this is the first time such a lecture series has been designed for foreign diplomats posted in India.

To a separate question on the Libyan peace process, Srivastava said, “We have been closely monitoring the developments in Libya and we have noted the progress in intra Libyan dialogue facilitated by the kingdom of Morocco.

“We welcome these international efforts aimed at peaceful settlement through an intra-Libyan dialogue taking into account the aspirations of the Libyan people, while preserving Libya’s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity,” he said.

Libya, an oil-rich country in North Africa, has been witnessing large-scale violence and unrest since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi“s four-decade regime in 2011.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/g4vzyv/article30833685.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15SUSHMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mea-launches-sushma-swaraj-lectures-for-foreign-diplomats/article32868546.ece
67,2020/10/16,"Rahul Gandhi says even Pak., Afghanistan handled pandemic better","Sharing projections by IMF that Indian economy is set to contract by 10.3 per cent, he mocks it as Modi govt’s ‘solid achievement’.

The Congress on Friday attacked the Narendra Modi government for its handling of the COVID-19 and its impact on the economy. Its former president Rahul Gandhi claimed that even Pakistan and Afghanistan handled the pandemic better.

Sharing projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the Indian economy is set to contract by a massive 10.3 per cent this year, Mr. Gandhi mocked it as the Modi government’s ‘solid achievement’. He tagged a chart that showed IMF growth projections for 2020-21 for Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, China, Bhutan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and India.

Another solid achievement by the BJP government.

“Another solid achievement by the BJP government. Even Pakistan and Afghanistan handled Covid better than India”, Mr. Gandhi tweeted.

‘Economy declining’

At a press conference, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said that while India’s COVID-19 infection figure was now nearly 74 lakh, with 1.12 lakh COVID-19 related deaths, its economy was among the fastest declining ones.

“On the one hand, there is the corona pandemic where there has been gross mismanagement, and on the other, Mr. Modi and his team have ensured that the Indian economy has completely got ruined and is in complete shambles. Today, there is no demand, no consumption, no investment and hardly any jobs. In fact, some data suggests that 46 percent Indians are earning less than what they did before corona,” Ms. Shrinate said.

“It is a cause of deep concern because today Bangladesh has higher per capita GDP and the government, instead of doing something about it, turns around and says ‘our purchasing power parity is higher’,”she added.

On Wednesday too, based on the IMF projections that Bangladesh’s per capita would cross India’s, the Congress leader tweeted it as “solid achievement of six years of BJP’s hate-filled cultural nationalism”.

Earlier this week, the IMF projected that India’s GDP will contract by 10.3 per cent this year but is likely to bounce back with an impressive 8.8 per cent growth rate in 2021.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/i74idg/article32868230.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI05-10-2020000059BTHNAK-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/even-pakistan-afghanistan-handled-covid-better-than-india-rahul-gandhi-on-imf-projections/article32868130.ece
68,2020/10/16,Deceased wife’s photo being circulated as Hathras victim: man files complaint at Delhi HC,"The Court said that if the man’s complaint is found to be correct, the government should act on it expeditiously by issuing necessary directions to Facebook, Google and Twitter in this regard.

The Delhi High Court has directed the Centre to look into the complaint of a man who claimed that a photograph of his deceased wife is being circulated on social media platforms wrongly depicting her as the victim of UP’s Hathras rape case.

Justice Navin Chawla said if the man’s complaint is found to be correct, the government should act on it expeditiously by issuing necessary directions to Facebook, Google and Twitter in this regard.

“In view of the submission made, the respondent no. 1 (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technologies) Is directed to look into the complaint of the petitioner (man) and, if the complaint of the petitioner is found to be correct, act on the same expeditiously, in any case, within a period of three days from the receipt of copy of this order, by issuing necessary directions to the respondent nos. 2 to 4 (Facebook, Twitter and Google) in this regard,” the court said in an order passed on October 13.

The court directed the man to send the necessary documents in support of his grievance to the ministry along with a copy of this order and also identifying the URLs which are currently carrying the offending content.

The court also issued notice to Ministry of Electronics and Information Technologies, Twitter, Facebook and Google on the plea seeking their responses, and listed the matter for further hearing on November 9.

During the hearing, the man told the court that the photograph of his deceased wife is being circulated on various social media platforms wrongly depicting her as the victim of the incident of rape and murder of a young girl at Hathras, Uttar Pradesh.

His counsel submitted that even otherwise, revelation of the identity of the rape victim is an offence under the Indian Penal Code, though in the present matter image of a wrong person is in circulation.

The counsel for Twitter agreed that the man can make a complaint to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), and once the information regarding the offending URLs is forwarded to it through the proper channel referring to this court order, the same would be blocked and removed from its platform.

The counsel for Google also made similar submission and said it was merely a search engine and once the information regarding the URLs of the offending content is forwarded to it, it will be deleted or blocked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xq1ju/article32734732.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hathrasdeathjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/deceased-wifes-photo-being-circulated-as-hathras-victim-man-files-complaint-at-delhi-hc/article32867729.ece
69,2020/10/16,Varavara Rao’s wife moves SC for his release,"“His continuing custody is a punishment not permissible in law”

Wife of poet and activist Dr. Varavara Rao approached the Supreme Court on Thursday for his immediate release from jail, saying his continued custody as an undertrial amounts to cruel and inhuman treatment and is violative of his dignity.

Pendyala Hemalatha squarely blamed the Maharashtra government and the National Investigation Agency for the deterioration in her husband’s health. She urged the apex court to grant him bail.

“The respondents [Maharashtra and the NIA] are solely responsible for the deterioration in Rao’s health by denying timely and proper medical treatment... The treatment meted out to Rao amounts to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. It is a form of punishment not permitted by law. He is entitled to immediately be set at liberty,” Ms. Hemalatha, represented by advocate Sunil Fernandes, submitted.

Mr. Rao, 79, was arrested in August 2018 in the Elgar Parishad case. He has been accused of offences under the draconian Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and the National Investigation Act. The chargesheet runs into 10,000 pages.

Ms. Hemalatha said her husband needed critical medical care. He had become very feeble in custody. He suffered from neurological problems and the after-effects of COVID-19 infection which he got while in custody.

“He is not in a position to stand trial. He needs critical medical care... No useful purpose is being served by his continued incarceration, except to torture him beyond human endurance,” she pleaded with the court.

He had also suffered a fall at the St George Hospital and injured his head.

“It is therefore highly likely that COVID-19 and the fall that he had in St George Hospital has led to neurological problems as is reflected in the medical report filed by Nanavati Hospital on July 30,” she submitted.

On August 17, the Bombay High Court had said that “considering the comorbid factors of age, persistent hyponatremia in COVID-19 case, the patient will require close monitoring.”

A petition seeking his medical reports from the Jailor, Taloja Jail, is still pending.

She recounted how Mr. Rao was hurriedly discharged from the hospital on June 1 just to “avoid judicial determination of his bail on medical grounds.”

“Chances of commencement of trial is bleak and charges are yet to be framed... There is no bar to granting bail on health grounds under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act or the National Investigation Act,” Ms. Hemalatha pleaded.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/varavara-raos-wife-moves-sc-for-his-release/article32866577.ece
70,2020/10/16,Bar Council condemns A.P. CM for ‘targetting’ judges,"The Bar Council of India, the apex lawyers’ body in the country, on Thursday condemned the “reprehensible move” by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to “target” Supreme Court judge, Justice N.V. Ramana, and several judges of the State High Court.

The day saw lawyers’ bodies rally to support Justice Ramana, saying the Chief Minister acted in an “irresponsible” manner. The Delhi Bar Association, which is the largest in Asia with 25,000 members, said Mr. Reddy’s letter to the Chief Justice of India was written with a “mala fide intent”.

The BCI, in a statement, said Mr. Reddy’s sole aim was to “undermine the independence of the judiciary and browbeat judges to suit his own purposes”.

The statement said there had been several such “overt and covert” attempts to attack sitting judges of the Supreme Court, but it was “most worrisome and alarming” that such an attack had now come from a Chief Minister.

The BCI called the release of a letter written by Mr. Reddy to the Chief Justice of India at a press conference a “sinister act” and a “manifestation of the conspiracy to scandalise and malign judges”.

The apex court body linked Mr. Reddy’s move to a PIL petition being heard by Justice Ramana to decriminalise politics and speed up the prosecution of corrupt politicians across the country. The day also saw the petitioner in PIL, advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, write to the CJI describing Mr. Reddy’s action as a “deliberate, fraudulent act” calculated to shake public faith in the judiciary.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bar-council-condemns-ap-cm-for-targetting-judges/article32866547.ece
71,2020/10/16,India to handover Kilo class attack submarine to Myanmar,"Move in line with vision that aspires to guarantee security for all maritime partners, says MEA

India will hand over INS Sindhuvir, a Kilo class submarine to the Myanmar Navy, the Ministry of External Affairs announced on Thursday. Addressing the weekly press interaction, official spokesperson of MEA Anurag Srivastava said this will be the first submarine of the Southeast Asian country and the move is in line with the overall Indian vision that aspires to guarantee security for all maritime partners.

“In this context, India will be delivering a Kilo class submarine INS Sindhuvir to the Myanmar Navy. We understand that this will be the first submarine of the Myanmar Navy. This is in accordance with our vision of SAGAR — Security and Growth for All in the Region, and also in line with our commitment to build capacities and self-reliance in all our neighbouring countries,” said Mr. Srivastava to a question.

The announcement came days after Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Chief of the Army Staff General Manoj Mukund Naravane visited Myanmar and held talks with State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and Commander in Chief of Defence Services Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. The submarine, purchased from the Soviet Union in the 1980s, has undergone modernisation at the Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL) in Vizag.

It belongs to a class of diesel-electric attack submarines built by the Soviet Union during the Cold War years.

The submarine will be the first in a fleet that Myanmar wishes to build and is likely to be used initially for training and orientation purposes for its Navy personnel. Last year, India supplied Myanmar ‘Shyena’ advanced light torpedoes as part of a defence deal. The October 4-5 visit of Mr. Shringla and General Naravane was also noteworthy as Myanmar and Bangladesh have recently engaged in a war of words over heightened military tension near the border at Chittagong regarding the Rohingya issue.

India’s military outreach to Myanmar is important as it comes in the backdrop of the ongoing military tension along the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh between India and China, a leading industrial and business partner of the Southeast Asian state.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-to-handover-kilo-class-attack-submarine-to-myanmar/article32866535.ece
72,2020/10/16,"Mumbai is a major destination for the drugs seized by NCB, 10 arrested","Mumbai emerged as a major destination for drugs seized by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) during operations conducted in the past few days, said the agency on Thursday. Ten persons, including a Nigerian national, have been arrested.

Apart from 1 kg of cocaine, the NCB has seized 2 kg of phencyclidine, over 29 kg of MDA (methylenedioxy​amphetamine), and 70 gm of mephedrone. In a separate operation, 56 kg of hashish was seized in Jammu. The main receiver was arrested from Mumbai.

The agency, in a statement, said one of the arrested persons was employed as a peon/runner with Balaji Telefilms Private Limited through a third party.

On October 12, the NCB’s Mumbai unit seized 1 kg of cocaine and two kg of phencyclidine from one M. Ahmed in Palghar. During interrogation, the accused disclosed that the contraband was provided by S.K. Saurabh for further sale. Accordingly, Saurabh was arrested the next day.

At Saurabh’s instance, the agency seized more than 29 kg of MDA from his shop on Tuesday. The accused disclosed that the drugs belonged to A. Khanivadekar and his brother, R. Khanivadekar.

“A. Khanivadekar has also been arrested. During interrogation, he revealed that his brother is an accused in a Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) case involving 483 kg of ephedrine and is currently on bail. Before the DRI raid, they had shifted the contraband to Saurabh’s shop,” said an official.

In another case, the NCB’s Jammu unit seized 56.4 kg of charas concealed in 55 packets kept at Ban Toll Plaza in Nagrota on Thursday. Three accused, identified as M. Gupta, A. Gambir and Sonia, all residents of Delhi, were arrested. The agency seized ₹1.91 lakh in cash and a vehicle used for transporting the contraband.

“The charas was destined for Mumbai. In a combined operation of the Operations unit and the Jammu zonal unit, the prime suspect named Faruk Chandbadhsah Shaikh was arrested on the Mumbai-Pune highway, along with one Kurban Ali, a resident of Nagaur in Rajasthan,” the official said.

During interrogation, the accused revealed that they were also involved in another case in which 6 kg of charas was seized from their other associates in Mumbai.

The NCB’s Operations wing also arrested Pradeep Rajaram Sahni with 70 gm of mephedrone in Mumbai’s Andheri West. Pradeep allegedly supplied the drugs to various persons in the Andheri and Juhu areas in Mumbai. Stating that he was employed as a peon/runner with Balaji Telefilms through a third party, the agency said his distribution network was being investigated.

In yet another operation, the NCB arrested a Nigerian national named Uka Emeka and allegedly seized 4 gm of cocaine from him.

The seized drug had originated from a South American country. It is suspected that the accused delivered it to his contacts in the Pali Hill, Bandra, Andheri, Juhu and Khar areas, the agency said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mumbai-is-a-major-destination-for-the-drugs-seized-by-ncb-10-arrested/article32866485.ece
73,2020/10/16,"SC issues notice to the RBI, NPCI among others","They are ‘compromising’ sensitive data of Indian users on United Payments Interface (UPI) platforms, says RS MP

The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to examine a petition filed by Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswam accusing the RBI and the National Payments Corporation of India of ‘compromising’ the sensitive data of Indian users on United Payments Interface (UPI) platforms.

“The RBI and NPCI have permitted the three members of ‘Big Four Tech Giants’, ie, Amazon, Google and Facebook/WhatsApp (Beta phase) to participate in the UPI ecosystem without much scrutiny and in spite of blatant violations of UPI guidelines and RBI regulations,” the petition said.

A Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the RBI, the NPCI and the companies. The petition wants RBI to frame regulations to ensure that users' data on UPI is not exploited or shared by foreign entities with their parent companies or third parties.

Mr. Viswam, represented by senior advocate Shyam Diwan and advocates Sriram Parakkat and Vishnu Shankar, said the “conduct of the RBI and NPCI puts the sensitive financial data of Indian users at huge risks, especially when these entities have been continuously accused of abusing dominance and compromising data, among other things”. The petitioner has also urged the court to direct the RBI and the NPCI to ensure that WhatsApp does not launch “full-scale operations of ‘WhatsApp Pay’ without complying with the requisite regulations.

The petition said the RBI, with a view to secure the data of Indian users, in April 2018, had issued a circular directing system providers to ensure that the entire data relating to payment system operated by them are stored in India. The deadline for compliance was October 15, 2018.

“However, since the systems’ providers, especially WhatsApp and Google Pay, failed to follow the deadline of October 2018. The RBI, in order to help WhatsApp, Google Pay, etc, and in complete disregard to the security of financial data of Indian users toned down the April 2018 circular by issuing FAQs and permitted the processing of all payment transactions abroad,” the petition said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-issues-notice-to-the-rbi-npci-among-others/article32866455.ece
74,2020/10/16,No end to violence against women: SC,"‘A majority prefer to suffer in silence’

The Supreme Court on Thursday said crimes against women continued in a “never-ending cycle” in India.

In a 151-page judgment, a Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan said women in India faced violence and discrimination in one form or the other in their various roles as daughter, sister, wife, mother, partner or single woman.

Though the judgment called a 2005 law against domestic harassment as a “milestone”, the Bench said domestic violence continued to be the least reported form of violence towards women.

Women continue to be vulnerable to these crimes because of non-retaliation, coupled with absence of laws addressing their rights and ignorance of the existing statutes. Societal attitude, stigma and conditioning also made women vulnerable to domestic violence, the court said.

Also, relationships outside marriage were not recognised. This set of circumstances ensured that a majority of women preferred to suffer in silence, not out of choice but of compulsion, the Bench, which included R. Subhash Reddy and M.R. Shah, said.

It said the progress of any society depended on its ability to protect and promote the rights of women.

The observations came in a judgment that held that the relief granting right to residence to a married woman under the domestic violence law by a criminal court was relevant and could be considered even in civil proceedings seeking her eviction from the matrimonial home.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/roxvug/article32866397.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16TH-COURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-end-to-violence-against-women-sc/article32866398.ece
75,2020/10/16,Opposition parties skip meet on Naga issue,"It was called to end the impasse in talks between the Centre and NSCN(IM).

The Opposition parties in Nagaland skipped the meeting that the Neiphiu Rio government convened on Thursday with political parties, traditional tribal bodies, students’ groups and NGOs for catalysing a solution to the Naga political issue.

The People’s Democratic Alliance (PDA) government headed by the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party had called the meeting in a bid to end the impasse in the peace talks between the Centre and the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, or NSCN(IM).

The NSCN (IM) has not wavered from its demands for a separate “Naga national flag” and “Naga constitution,” while seven rival groups that came together as the Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) have virtually reached an agreement with the Centre on all outstanding issues.

“The peace talks have concluded with all groups and Governor R.N. Ravi [also the Centre’s representative] has already met all tribal bodies, civil society organisations and political parties. Rio did not feel the need to consult anyone during the 17 years he has ruled as the Chief Minister. So, attending this meeting would have been a waste of time,” said State Congress president K. Therie.

Some organisations, including the Naga Hoho, the apex organisation of all Naga tribes, were unhappy with the outcome of the meeting. “We did not have enough time to place our views on the need for unity among the Nagas. But it seems no one likes to be united,” Naga Hoho president H.K. Zhimomi said.

Apart from the Congress, the Naga People’s Front (NPF) and the Janata Dal (United) also skipped the meeting.

The NPF, too, felt that the meeting was “meaningless”. NPF president Shurhozelie Liezietsu said the PDA was trying to create “confusion” when the Centre was not keen on a piecemeal settlement.

“We formed the Political Affairs Mission after withdrawing from the Joint Legislators’ Forum [for taking the peace process forward] some time ago. Through the mission, we are trying to hold a joint meeting of all the extremist groups,” he said.

“We told both organisations that the Government of India will go for only one settlement and not separate deals. So, it would be in the interest of the Naga people that they discuss all issues face to face,” Mr Liezietsu said.

Leaders of the Naga Mothers’ Association also said the meeting did not up to their expectations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/opposition-parties-skip-meet-on-naga-issue/article32866671.ece

The J&K government on Thursday signed an MoU with prominent online retailer Flipkart “to provide an online platform for showcasing and facilitating the local artisans, craftsmen and weavers to reach customers across the globe”.

The MoU was signed in the presence of Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha; Managing Director, J&K Handloom and Handicrafts Corporation, Hashmat Ali, and Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Flipkart Group. Rajneesh Kumar.

“The initiative by the government is more beneficial to Flipkart than to the artists of J&K given the kind of unmatched, unique, world-class and nowhere-else to be seen artistry and dexterity of the artisans of J&K,” the L-G said.

He said the partnership with the e-commerce marketplace will enable the local artisans, craftsmen and weavers to reach the global market. “It will also provide an appropriate opportunity for the momentous growth and development of the respective sectors,” the L-G said.

Officials said the special web portal ‘Samarth’ of e-commerce giant Flipkart will now cater to hitherto uncovered products of handicrafts and handloom.

“It is an important step towards the promotion of the rural economy and to boost the sale of genuine exotic products of Handicrafts and Handloom sector and find new destinations for niche handmade products from J&K, which hold sway in the international market,” an official spokesman said.

During the virtual signing of the MoU, a few artisans also showcased their products.

Initially, the tie-up is supposed to cover dozens of products of lower and middle range segments like paper mache, walnut craft gift items, shawls and stoles, embroidery made-ups and namda rugs, chain stitch wall hangings, willow wicker, Gabba, etc. “Many more craft items shall be added subsequently,” the official said.

The Assembly of Journalists (AOJ), a platform of a section of editors and journalists, organised a sit in in Agartala on Thursday to protest against alleged growing threat to the media. The protesters demanded immediate action against perpetrators of threats and assaults on journalists in the State.

The stir was called a day after a delegation of AOJ met in-charge DGP to express concern over incidents of attack and intimidation against journalists in rural subdivisions. It alleged that the police did not initiate action against the accused persons despite registration of complaints.

Other demands of the group include withdrawal of an “official circular” that allegedly prohibited government officers from speaking to the media. AOJ Chairman Subal Kumar Dey said they were also demanding an explanation from Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb for his September 11 speech in which the latter allegedly criticised local newspapers for exaggerating news on COVID-19 situation.

79,2020/10/16,Bhind police to stamp bullets with QR codes to curb gun violence,"Firearms licensees asked to come forward to get casings of bullets printed with the code ahead of byelection

The Bhind police have launched an initiative to stamp bullets with quick response (QR) codes which will help in tracing them back to the firearm, in a bid to curb gun violence.

The police had exhorted nearly 22,000 firearms licensees of the district to come forward to get casings of bullets printed with the code ahead of the byelection, as part of the country’s first such initiative, said Superintendent of Police Manoj Kumar.

In the past five years, the district had witnessed around 150 murders, most committed using illegal weapons. “Hardcore criminals procure country weapons and bullets from different locations, but others buy a country pistol and use factory-made bullets. My effort is to reduce gun violence, even if by 10%,” Mr. Kumar added.

In the Gwalior Chambal region, where there were around a lakh licence holders, owning a firearm is considered a matter of pride. “Even during election, there are complaints of bullets being sold illegally. The code will help curtail the practice too,” said Mr. Kumar.

During investigations, the blank cartridge of a fired bullet is matched with the firing pin of a firearm, which also helps in identifying the owner. “Most countries number arms, but not bullets which is a herculean task. In some, there are smart bullets having radio chips,” he said.

Mr. Kumar said the initiative was inspired by international models. “Gun violence is rampant in the United States, where smart guns having chips have been developed,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bhind-police-to-stamp-bullets-with-qr-codes-to-curb-gun-violence/article32866298.ece

Ten lockers have been sealed.

The I-T Department suspects that the advocate received huge amounts in cash from his clients to settle their disputes.

“Incriminating documents of unaccounted cash transactions and investments made by the assessee over several years have been found. Substantial digital data reflecting unaccounted transactions of the assessee and his associates, who are financiers and builders, has also been recovered,” said the agency in a statement on Thursday.

In one case, the advocate had allegedly received ₹117 crore from a client in cash, whereas he had shown only ₹21 crore in his records, which was received through cheque. In another case, he received more than ₹100 crore in cash from an infrastructure and engineering company for its arbitration proceedings with a public sector company, said the agency.

The unaccounted cash was invested in residential and commercial properties, and in taking over of trusts engaged in the running of schools. The evidence gathered by the I-T Department indicates investment of more than ₹100 crore in cash in several properties in posh areas in the last two years.

The advocate and his associates have also purchased several schools and properties, for which too more than ₹100 crore was paid in cash.

81,2020/10/16,Bihar Assembly election: Tough contest for Bankipore,"The sitting MLA from the BJP is confident of a win but giving him competition are several new faces

Whirring choppers carrying political party leaders on their campaign trail have become a common sight in many “hot seats” of poll-bound Bihar these days. But particularly prestigious is the Bankipore Assembly constituency in Patna.

Vying for the Bankipore seat are an alumnus of Oxford University, a former student of the London School of Economics, actor Shatrughan Sinha’s son Luv Sinha, former BJP leader Sushma Sahu and three-time BJP MLA Nitin Navin.

Manish Barriarr, 44, an alumnus of Oxford University started his campaign a few days ago. Supporting him on the campaign trail are two of his friends — Amritesh Kumar, an alumnus of IIM-Kozhikode and Manjit Singh, an alumnus of the Delhi School of Economics. In 2019-20, Mr. Barriarr had won a scholarship for an organisational leadership programme at Oxford.

The son of Patna High Court lawyer Binod Kumar Barriarr, Manish had worked in a multi-national firm but later entered the teaching profession, along with his wife — a Delhi University graduate.

“I ask for votes to improve education and work for industrialisation and town planning... if these three things are worked upon, the rest will fall in line automatically here,” he said. He has raised money for the campaign through crowd-funding from friends and well-wishers. “We need more and more candidates like Manish to become lawmakers of the State and improve our political system,” Satish Kumar, a resident of the constituency told The Hindu.

New party

Another candidate in the fray is Pushpam Priya Chaudhury, an alumna of the London School of Economics. She has floated a new party “Plurals”. Advertisements in local newspapers and billboards dotting the roads of Patna term her an ideal candidate for the Chief Minister’s post. Her party has fielded candidates in a few other constituencies as well. The daughter of a JD(U) leader from Darbhanga district, Ms. Chaudhury has been promoting herself on social media too.

The latest entrant into the fray is Luv Sinha, son of Bollywood actor Shatrughan Sinha who is a former, two-time BJP MP from Patna Sahib Lok Sabha constituency (in which the Bankipore Assembly seat falls). Luv Sinha joined the Congress party on October 14 and is likely to file his nomination for Bankipore soon.

Luv Sinha was actively involved in Shatrughan Sinha’s campaign for the 2019 Lok Sabha election on a Congress ticket. The actor lost to BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad.

BJP vote bank

Also in the electoral arena is a former prominent face of Bihar BJP’s women’s wing Sushma Sahu. She was actively involved in political activities of the BJP but is now contesting as an Independent candidate. She is likely to make a significant dent into the vote bank of the sitting BJP MLA Nitin Navin.

Nitin Navin is a three-time MLA from the seat, which was earlier represented by his father, Navin Kishore Sinha. Nitin Navin, who filed his nomination on Thursday, appeared confident of retaining the seat. “I hardly bother who is in the fray against me…I’ve full confidence in my relationship with local people here, which goes back years and years,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/v3njc1/article32866275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15KRABANKIPORE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bihar-assembly-election-tough-contest-for-bankipore/article32866276.ece
82,2020/10/16,‘Oppn. parties looted waqf land in Karnataka’,"BJP cites 2012 report of State Minorities Commission

The BJP accused Opposition parties in Karnataka on Thursday of having “looted” waqf land meant for poor Muslims, citing a report by the State’s Minorities Commission.

Party spokesperson and MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar said the commission had pointed out that over 29,000 acres of waqf land was “surreptitiously and illegally” transferred for commercial use. While the report was prepared in 2012, it was tabled in the State Assembly eight years and two “secular governments” later in September this year.

Mr. Chandrasekhar demanded an investigation into such waqf land irregularities in other States too.

The waqf board in the State holds 54,000 acres of land, of which 29,000 acres were “illegally” used for commercial purposes, he said. He named Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and C.M. Ibrahim as being among the alleged beneficiaries of the irregularities.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aj9f7x/article32865939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THRAJEEV-CHANDRASEKHAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oppn-parties-looted-waqf-land-in-karnataka/article32865940.ece

84,2020/10/16,Assam police officer accused in SI exam scam arrested,"Earlier, the former SP of Karimganj Kumar Sanjit Krishna had a meeting with senior officials at DGP office

The Assam police’s Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Thursday arrested a police officer accused in the sub-inspector recruitment exam scam 24 hours after he had gone “missing.”

A police spokesperson said Kumar Sanjit Krishna, the former Superintendent of Police of southern Assam’s Karimganj district, turned up at the office of Director-General of Police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta where he had a marathon meeting with senior officials.

“His arrest followed a medical test. He would be produced before a competent court tomorrow [on Friday],” the spokesperson said.

The name of the former Karimganj SP, the brother of Assam’s Chief Secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna, had cropped up after the CID interrogated one Rubul Ali, an accused in the leaking of question papers of the exam to recruit 597 unarmed sub-inspectors.

Some 66,000 candidates were answering the questions on September 20 when the exam was cancelled after the leaked question paper went viral on social media.

Ali, in his confession, said the question papers were leaked from Mr. Krishna’s office and that he was allowed to take photographs of the pages for ₹40 lakh. He also said he had sent the photographs to BJP leader Diban Deka, who was arrested on October 1.

Mr. Krishna was interrogated separately by Additional DGP (Law and Order) G.P. Singh and senior CID officials on Monday. But he went “missing” from Tuesday.

Officials said the CID raided Mr. Krishna’s house as well as that of Prasanta Dutta, the Additional SP of Karimganj district, also accused in the exam paper leak.

The police had earlier arrested retired Deputy Inspector-General of Police P.K. Dutta for his alleged involvement in the scam. At least 45 others, including some of the 50 candidates who had appeared for the “written test” at a Guwahati guesthouse a day ahead of the scheduled test, have also been arrested.

85,2020/10/16,Going gets worse for the homeless,"Elderly and orphans hard hit as sources of help dry up this year

Elderly people and orphans living on the streets have seen their fate take a turn for the worse this year.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic led to the shutting down of public places like railway stations, bus stands and parks — leaving them with no place to spend the night. The closure of commercial establishments ensured that they now had nowhere to go to for food.

With nowhere to stay and no source of food or alms, homeless people endured one of the toughest phases of their life, said officials.

Observing their plight, Parvathipuram Municipal Commissioner Kanaka Mahalakshmi allocated a building near Rythu Bazar in the town for their stay. She also roped in the services of the Integrated Rural People Welfare Association (IRPWA) to ensure regular meals for the destitute. Under the programme of Shelter for Urban Homeless, the municipality sanctions around ₹50 per day to provide food for orphans and neglected elderly persons.

IRPWA Director P.K. Prakasha Rao and his friends and a few philanthropists are also contributing money to ensure that the homeless people get three meals a day.

“Fifty-two destitute people could get decent shelter and food through the joint efforts of Parvathipuram Municipality and IRPWA. As many of them were suffering from various health problems, we organised medical camps under the supervision of senior doctors. Periodical medical check ups and medicines were ensured for needy persons,” said Mr. Prakasha Rao. According to him, IRPWA is supplying food at ₹23 for tribal people and others who come to Parvathipuram Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) for submission of petitions to higher officials on Monday which is observed as Grievance Day. “In spite of skyrocketing of prices of essential commodities and vegetables, we have kept the price unchanged in order to serve as many people as possible,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/je0rjy/article32876624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17-VJ-HOMELESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/going-gets-worse-for-the-homeless/article32876625.ece

88,2020/10/16,Fake godman peddling ‘hidden treasure’ held,"Several people hoodwinked, say police

A fake godman and two of his accomplices were arrested by Rajampeta police for trying to hoodwink people by claiming that they had knowledge of a hidden treasure.

Shaik Mahboob Basha alias Usman Ali Khan, hailing from Gooty town in Anantapur district, donned the guise of a godman and began calling himself ‘Syed Baba’. Basha used to sell coffee powder and later sold saris for a living before he decided to earn a quick buck by becoming a fake godman.

Along with a man named Murali of Enampalli village in Puttaparthi mandal, Basha began posing as a man with deep occult knowledge who had the ability to detect ‘treasures’ hidden deep below the ground. Basha managed to hoodwink several people and collected ₹10,000 to ₹20,000 from them in order to tell them where such treasures were hidden.

Two months ago, Murali succumbed to COVID-19 after which Basha joined hands with a man named S. Venkatesulu and an ITI graduate S. Satish, who provided Basha SIM cards.

The trio broke into the house of a liquor baron after hearing that a large sum of money was hidden in the house, but returned empty-handed. They made similar burglary attempts in Anantapur, Tirupati, Molakamuru and Rajampet areas.

Based on information, the trio was picked up at Bellary Chowrastha in Kurnool by Rajampeta Rural Inspector Y. Narendra Reddy early on Friday.

Superintendent of Police K.K.N. Anburajan produced the trio, mentioned as accused number 23, 34 and 35 respectively in the case, at a press meet here on Friday and appreciated the team headed by Deputy Superintendent of Police (Rajampeta) Narayanaswamy Reddy for the breakthrough.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/fake-godman-peddling-hidden-treasure-held/article32876595.ece
89,2020/10/16,CITU leader’s campaign against labour codes,"‘Workers need to be aware of their fundamental rights’

Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) State vice-president D. Govinda Rao on Friday launched a sharp attack on the Centre over the new labour codes passed recently by Parliament.

“The replacement of 25 existing labour laws has diluted the rights of labourers and will favour industrialists in the country,” said Mr. Govinda Rao, adding that labourers are unaware of their rights and what they are going to lose under the new labour codes, which he termed ‘toothless’.

“When people are facing untold miseries due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Union government has silently passed the Labour Codes. It is nothing but stabbing 26 crore workers in the back. The government did not consult either the Opposition or trade unions over replacing the existing Acts which were enacted after decades of struggle during British regime itself,” he said.

Mr. Govinda Rao, who has conducted over 80 agitations against the establishment of a nuclear power plant in Srikakulam district and has opposed forcible land acquisition for the Bhavanapadu port and other units, said he is ready to face arrest in order to protect the interests of the working class.

“There is no job security. Any company can fire any worker without prior notice. It can even get labourers arrested if they agitate for their legitimate rights. Family members cannot even ask for compensation if any person dies while working in factories. The Labour Department now has little role with the introduction of the Labour Codes,” Mr. Govinda Rao alleged.

Mr. Govinda Rao, who hails from the remote Jaganndhapuram village of Kotabommali mandal, argues powerfully in labour courts against multinational corporate pharmaceutical companies and others.

“Over 50,000 workers need to know the injustice done by the Union government with the introduction of Labour Codes. That is why we have been organising awareness programmes for them in the industrial zone of Srikakulam district. They need to know their rights within the framework of the existing Labour Codes and State government laws. The aim of awareness programmes is to make them confident about protecting their legitimate rights. It is the need of the hour for every labourer in the country,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/citu-leaders-campaign-against-labour-codes/article32876594.ece
90,2020/10/16,‘One-eyed’ lone tusker on the loose in Chittoor,"It had reportedly killed a forest department jeep driver

The forest officials on Friday issued a public alert in Yadamarri and Bangarupalem mandals of Chittoor district, bordering with Tamil Nadu forests, about a wild tusker on the prowl, which had reportedly killed a forest department jeep driver on Wednesday night.

According to information, the full-grown tusker, detected to be blind in one eye, has retreated into the forests of the border area, one km away from the accident spot in Yadamarri mandal. The tusker had attacked a forest department jeep killing the driver, while a beat officer escaped by a whisker.

Divisional Forest Officer S. Ravi Shankar told The Hindu that the tusker had been on the move in the forests of the border area for the last one month. “Our personnel detected that it is blind in one eye, and turns aggressive on seeing humans. It’s clear that the tusker is lingering in Yadamarri mandal to feed on the standing crops of banana and paddy. Driving the animal back into the forest is a big task, going by the terrain with agriculture lands, jungles and hillocks,” he said.

The DFO said that apart from the one-eyed tusker, another elephant was moving inside the forest, but close to the accident site. “We are waiting for the one-eyed tusker to join the other loner, so that their passage towards the thickets would be easier. Except for making its presence near the Yadamarri-Paradarami (T.N.) forest road, the tusker is not regularly venturing into the fields,” he said.

Mr. Ravi Shankar said people of the vulnerable areas of the mandals had been urged to avoid moving close to the Kanthalacheruvu locality, where the forest jeep was attacked. “As an immediate step to avoid man-animal conflict here, we are proposing to go in for a digging a trench along a couple of kilometers parallel to the inter-State road,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/i3qbg6/article32876435.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17VJTUSKER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/one-eyed-lone-tusker-on-the-loose-in-chittoor/article32876436.ece

Telugu Desam Party national general secretary Nara Lokesh has said the ‘inaction’ of the State government in helping the farmers hit by floods is glaring and could lead to mass suicides. Mr. Lokesh was speaking to reporters after touring the flood-affected mandals of Mangalagiri, Tenali, and Kolluru.

At Chirravuru village in Mangalagiri mandal, Mr. Lokesh said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy made tall promises before elections, but not stepped out of his house after assuming power. Mr. Lokesh said that farmers cultivating banana and turmeric in Tenalai mandal were badly hit and asked the State government to announce compensation immediately.

At Tenali mandal, Mr. Lokesh visited the villages of Atthlurivaripalem, Pidaparthi, and Patha Bommanivaripalem, and said 14 persons lost lives in recent floods, and crops in 2.50 lakh acres were submerged and the loss to farmers could be about ₹400 crore. The worst hit were the farmers cultivating horticultural crops, he added.

Suicide by farmers

Launching a scathing attack on the State government, Mr. Lokesh said that 750 farmers committed suicide in 17 months after YSRCP coming to power. Farmers were promised ₹13,500 under the Rythu Bharosa , but now, the State government was saying it can pay only ₹7,500. Out of 15 lakh tenant farmers, the government extended aid under the Rythu Bharosa to just 57,000 farmers. The agricultural budget was also reduced to ₹7,000 crore from ₹19,000 crore given during the TDP regime. Even the arrears of paddy procurement were not paid to farmers, while ₹6,400 crore was paid to contractors.

95,2020/10/16,House boats make a splash in the Godavari,"APTDC obtains permission to operate them in Konaseema from October-end

The Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) has obtained permission from the A.P. Maritime Board to resume the operation of the famed house boats in Vasista, a branch of the Godavari, enabling tourists to explore the serene beauty of the Konaseema region in Andhra Pradesh.

The boating operations were suspended in September last year following the sinking of a tourist boat in the Godavari in the midst of the Papikonda hills. Later, the State government came up with a set of revised guidelines for boat operations.

APTDC Divisional Manager (East and West Godavari Districts) Thota Veera Narayana told The Hindu that they are geared up to resume operations. “We have obtained the permission to operate two house boats in the Vasista at Dindi. We have already prepared the ground to resume the operation of the house boats mostly likely by October-end. Necessary facilities have been provided in the boats and all precautions will be taken. Required repairs have also been done to the house boats,” he said.

“On the business front, we are hoping that the house boats will give a boost to tourism in the Konaseema region,” Mr. Veera Narayana said.

‘Fully fit’

“The two boats are kept ready for the operations as they are fully fit. We have already received a communication from higher officials to prepare for boat operations. Most likely, boating will commence on an auspicious day immediately after Dasara (October 25)”, house boats in-charge D. Subba Rao told The Hindu.

The two house boats, each with a seating capacity of 20, are operated from Dindi resort in East Godavari district every day, facilitating tourists to explore the Konaseema and tranquil waters of the Godavari before it empties out into the sea, passing amid lush green canopies of coconut orchids along the banks of the river.

Fare

The boating services are offered to tourists for a seven-hour day trip (₹9,000) or a single day-and-night trip (₹12,000). While most of the bookings are done by families, group bookings are also allowed.

Mr. Subba Rao explained the boating route. “The boat starts at 10 a.m. from Dindi village in Konaseema to cross the Vasista to reach Narsapur in West Godavari. It will be back in Dindi for lunch and then proceed towards Rajole to wind up the seven-hour trip by 6 p.m.”.

96,2020/10/16,Environmental concerns over ship that ran aground,"Experts say it has to be towed back before it becomes a permanent feature on the Visakhapatnam coast

The 3,000-tonne Bangladeshi ship MV Maa that ran aground near Tenneti Park in Visakhapatnam on Tuesday, has become a cause of worry for environmentalists and experts who have served in the shipping industry.

They feel that the ship has to be recovered and towed back to the high seas before it becomes a permanent feature on the coast, and end up like MV River Princess in Goa.

The 1.14 lakh-tonne MV River Princess, an oil tanker, ran aground on June 6, 2000, due to a cyclone at the Candolim beach in Goa. The ship could not be salvaged or towed back and remained in the beach for over 12 years, and it had to be dismantled part-by-part in situ, creating a lot of ecological and environmental problems.

“To avoid such a fate, the authorities concerned such as Visakhapatnam Port Trust and the district administration, should pressure the ship owners and agents to see that the vessel is towed back to safety at the earliest,” said Marine Chief Engineer S.V. Durga Prasad, who also served in the Mercantile Marine Department.

“Any ship that runs aground, should be removed as fast as possible, otherwise it can become a huge environmental issue. Luckily, in this case there is no oil spill, and efforts are on to remove the diesel stock of around 40 tonnes onboard. Not only oil, a ship carries a lot of contaminants and over the years, it only increases and that is why it needs to be pulled back to safety on war footing,” he said.

Mr. Prasad pointed out that pulling it back might not be a very difficult task, as the ship till date looks stable and it was a small ship of only about 3000 tonnes and not as huge as River Princess that weighed over 1.14 lakh tonnes DWT. Once the tide was on the higher side, high-power tugs could be used to tow it, he said.

Meanwhile, it is learnt that VPT had approached DG Shipping, and a team would be surveying the damage and asking the owners to take up the salvage operation.

According to a senior VPT official, it was the responsibility of the owner to take care of the operation. They may fund it themselves or ask Protection and Indemnity Club to do it, he said.

Sources in VPT say that there appeared to be no power onboard the ship and that could be one reason, why the engines had died down.

“The engines might not have functioned and that is why the ship drifted towards the shore, after losing both its anchors, due to the high wind speed on that day. Ideally, the ship should have sailed towards the high seas or moved into the safety of the harbour, after we clearly gave the options and update on the weather,” sources said.

“We are ready to supply the required number of tugs and manpower and Indian Coast Guard is ready for containing any oil spill or rescue the crew on board. It is now up to the owners of the ship to take a call,” said a senior officer from VPT.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qfpum9/article32867687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16VJSHIP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/environmental-concerns-over-ship-that-ran-aground/article32867688.ece
97,2020/10/16,Woman delivers baby on flood bank in Andhra Pradesh,"Police shift mother and child to nearby hospital

Recurrent floods have only made the villagers living on the river bed resilient. Over the years, the villagers living in lanka lands (dry river beds) have been undaunted by the raging flood fury. The people in lanka villages downstream of the Prakasam Barrage seemed unperturbed even as flood water has been rising for the last two days inundating vast tracts of fruit-yielding fields.

On Thursday, flood discharge crossed seven lakh cusecs from the Prakasam Barrage. Even as the villagers of Kollueu began to ponder whether to evacuate their homes, a woman, Nattala Bhagya Lakshmi, started experiencing labour pains. With little time left for shifting the woman to the nearby hospital, nearly 30 km away at Tenali, the villagers got together and with the assistance of relatives of the woman, helped her deliver a baby right on the narrow flood bank, abutting the swirling flood waters.

Sub-Inspector of Kolluru, S. Ujwal, who came to know about the plight of the woman, quickly got into the act. “We thought of hiring a boat but none came forward in view of surging waters. So I along with some villagers, reached the Ipurulanka by using a rope tied to palm trees. It was a risky operation and we managed to reach the woman. Meanwhile, locals helped the woman deliver a baby and I carried the baby in my arms as we helped the woman reach the hospital,” said Mr. Ujwal.

For the people living on tiny islands abutting the Krishna, the floods pose a challenge as any discharge over seven lakh cusecs inundates their fields and water enters their houses.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/uy37fz/article32866104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16VJBABY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/woman-delivers-baby-on-flood-bank/article32866105.ece

The frontline warriors who have been serving the coronavirus patients were felicitated here on Thursday, commemorating the birth anniversary of former President Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

Sri Padmavathi Nilayam at Tiruchanur, which belongs to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) was converted into a COVID Care Centre and has been rated among the best in extending services.

Recalling the efforts of the frontline workers in extending services at the centre since March, TUDA Chairman Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy felicitated the medical and sanitary staff.

He said the staff infused confidence in the people admitted to the centre by paying personal attention. He recalled that a British national was among the first to get admitted to the centre and treated here during the first phase of national lockdown. The British national appreciated this centre’s hospitality on global platforms.

100,2020/10/16,Cong. seeks grounding of NTPC-BHEL plant,"Stone was laid for the project at Mannavaram in 2010

The Congress activists on Thursday staged a demonstration in front of the tahsildar’s office at Venkatagiri, demanding the early grounding of the ₹8,000-crore NTPC-BHEL Power Projects Limited (NBPPL) plant proposed at Mannavaram in Chittoor district to manufacture turbines for power plants and generate jobs for local youth.

The activists led by Congress leaders from the Assembly segments of Venkatagiri, Sarvepalli, Gudur, Sullurpeta, and Srikalahasti lamented that the foundation stone for the proposed plant was laid by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2010, but there has been no progress in the last 10 years.

“The plant, which was scheduled to start commercial production in 2015, is yet to see the light of the day. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy should bring pressure on the Central government to speed up the implementation the project,” they said.

Congress leaders P.Srinivasulu Reddy, P. Chandrasekar, Battaiah Naidu, N. Rajasekar, C. Eswaraiah and P. Venkateswarlu took part in the protest.

‘State govt. must make its stand clear’

Special Correspondent from Tirupati adds: Meanwhile, the Congress activists staged a similar demonstration in Srikalahasti town.

Leading the demonstration, APCC member Batheiah Naidu demanded that the State government must clear the air on the issue and spell out its stand on the status of the proposed NTPC-BHEL Power Projects Limited (NBPPL) plant.

The party leaders also recalled that it was promised during the foundation stone laying ceremony that the project would create job opportunities to every household in the Srikalahasti and Venkatagiri Assembly constituencies.

On the backburner

“However, the NTPC-BHEL Power Projects Limited (NBPPL) plant had been pushed to the backburner by the subsequent Central and State governments for the reasons known to them. It is high time the YSRCP government spelt out its stand on the fate of the plant,” said Mr. Batheiah Naidu, adding that the hopes of the local residents to get jobs at the proposed plant have been dashed.

Talks are also doing the rounds that the project has been shifted to somewhere in North India, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cong-seeks-grounding-of-ntpc-bhel-plant/article32866171.ece

103,2020/10/16,Vizianagaram-Parvatipuram route takes a toll on motorists,"The single-lane highway is in urgent need of repairs

The commute between Vizianagaram and Parvatipuram — a distance of roughly 75 km — has become a nightmare for motorists.

The condition of the road has worsened to such an extent that the commute between the two towns, which should ideally take less than two hours, now takes three-and-a-half hours.

Motorists say they cannot drive faster than 30-40 kmph, and have to slow down to a crawl every few hundred metres due to huge potholes. The absence of road markings is also proving to be dangerous for motorists, particularly at night, as the road is a single-lane highway with no dividers.

Though the government had laid new roads in many parts of the district, no work was taken up on this important route. The deterioration of the road is now resulting in long traffic jams and frequent accidents.

The rainy season only adds to motorists’ woes. Due to recent heavy rains in the district, the road has suffered even more damage in several parts.

“The road used to be in good condition earlier. But over the years, lack of repairs has left it in a dilapidated condition. The traffic jams and railway crossing at Manapuram add to the delay,” said Vangali Dalinaidu, a resident of Parvatipuram.

With APSRTC operating only limited services on the route due to COVID-19, many people are forced to use personal transport. “There is every chance of the vehicle breaking down on the highway due to the potholes. And in case of a breakdown at night, it is extremely risky as it is a single-lane highway. Riding two-wheelers on this route is very dangerous. It is unfortunate as this is an important route connecting Vizianagaram to Raipur,” said M. Janakiram Reddy, a resident of Vizianagaram, urging the government to take up immediate repairs in order to restore smooth flow of traffic.

‘Funds sanctioned’

Vizianagaram Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal said that repairs would be taken up on a war footing on all routes. “The main damage was done to R&B Roads. That is why we have sanctioned ₹10 crore for immediate repairs. The new roads will be laid after getting details from all places,” he said.

The Roads and Buildings Department and Panchayat Raj department have been directed to submit details immediately for the administrative sanction of funds for repairs. Senior officials will personally inspect the roads to identify major damages. They have been directed to submit a report on the repairs of important bridges located near Saluru, Bobbili and Parvatipuram.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tuswsc/article32866149.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16-VJ-VZMROADS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vizianagaram-parvatipuram-route-takes-a-toll-on-motorists/article32866150.ece
104,2020/10/16,BJP will not support any move to impeach judges: Madhav,"‘Party has complete faith in the country’s judiciary’

The BJP will not support the impeachment motion against Supreme Court judges in Parliament if the YSRCP musters enough support and moves one in both Houses, after having written a letter to the Chief Justice of India, party State general secretary P.V.N. Madhav has said.

Addressing the media here on Thursday, Mr. Madhav said the YSRCP complaint against the judges was not in good taste.

“But the BJP believes that the TDP used the judges and resorted to insider trading in Amaravati lands. The TDP is now openly supporting the judges after the complaint,” Mr. Madhav said.

“The BJP, however, will not support any move of the YSRCP, as it has faith in the judiciary of the country and will not be a party to the impeachment proceedings against the judges,” he added.

Amaravati lands

Launching the ‘Jana Jagaran’ programme in support of the three farm Acts passed in Parliament recently and to explain the people as to how they were beneficial, Mr. Madhav said the TDP had resorted to cheating the farmers in Amaravati in the name of land pooling and did not give them the promised developed plot while it was in power.

“The YSRCP is no better with the issue hanging fire even today,” he pointed out. The BJP, he said, was for only single capital at Amaravati.

“None in Visakhapatnam is happy to have the proposed Executive Capital, as it will inconvenience them a lot, leave alone development,” Mr. Madhav claimed.

While the TDP leaders resorted to insider trading in Amaravati, the YSRCP leaders did the same in Visakhapatnam by pooling 7,000 acres, he alleged. He said the BJP would support a CBI probe into the alleged insider trading in Amaravati.

“What is preventing Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to talk to the farmers of the Amaravati region and settle the issue by addressing their concerns and giving them the developed plots as promised by the government?” he questioned.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/eh0ode/article32866093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16VJPG4-MADHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bjp-will-not-support-any-move-to-impeach-judges-madhav/article32866094.ece

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has said that the government will not touch the revenue generated by the municipal corporations and municipalities, and has ordered that it be spent on local development. He has called upon the local bodies to strive to achieve self-sustainability to the extent possible.

Addressing a review meeting on the reforms to be initiated in the urban local bodies on Thursday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy stressed the need for evolving standard operating procedures that help in rendering citizen services in the desired manner, and said the government would pay the employees’ salaries through ‘010 head of account’ as usual.

Thrust areas

He instructed the officials to give due priority to drinking water supply and sanitation. He said that an action plan should be drafted for improving the financial standing of the corporations and municipalities by doing a detailed study of the expenditure (operational and maintenance, employees’ salaries and other expenses) and the various sources of revenue.

106,2020/10/16,Sailajanath launches signature campaign against farm reforms,"‘Party will urge President to get the three Acts repealed as they are against farmers’ interests’

APCC president S. Sailajanath launched the ‘Two crore signature campaign’ here on Thursday to mobilise support against the three farm Acts enacted by Parliament recently.

“We will meet the President on November 14 in New Delhi after gathering the signatures from across the country and request him to intervene in getting the legislations repealed. These Acts will work against the interests of the farmers as the Minimum Support Price is being done away with,” Dr. Sailajanath told reporters while launching the campaign here.

‘Corporates will gain’

The Congress government had introduced the MSP to protect the rights of the farmers seven decades ago, but the BJP government was implementing the RSS agenda by handing over the entire farming activity to the corporates on a platter, he said, and added that the farmers would be forced to grow only what these companies wanted at a price fixed by them.

“The BJP has handed over the Railways partially to the corporates,” he alleged. With regard to the MSP too, the Centre was following the Bihar model, where MSP was done away with 15 years ago, Dr. Sailajanath said.

Power meters

Criticising the YSRCP government for deciding to go ahead with the its plan to fix power meters for agriculture connections, Dr. Sailajanath asked Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to shelve the proposal.

“Let the Chief Minister first tour Kurnool and Anantapur districts, where farmers have lost groundnut and cotton crops in a big way. They farmers should immediately be compensated,” he said.

Dr. Sailajanath further demanded that additional input subsidy be given immediately to all the farmers who had lost their crops, besides paying them the input subsidy dues the previous government had kept pending since 2018.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/8406oz/article32866021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16VJPG4-CONG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sailajanath-launches-signature-campaign-against-farm-reforms/article32866022.ece

Govt. aid

Addressing a press conference after the review meeting, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said that every affected farmer will be provided compensation by the government. He also said that details regarding the crop damage are being displayed at all the Sachivalayams in the district.

“If any farmer has not registered the details about their losses with the government, they can do it at the sachivalayam,” he said.

Mr. Vinay Chand said that the district has received 500% more rainfall than normal. S. Rayavaram, Bheemili, Yelamanchali, Sabbavaram, Visakha (Urban), Rambilli and Gajuwaka received 20 cm of rain on October 12, 13 and 14, he said.

CPI State assistant secretary J.V. Satyanarayana Murthy on Thursday alleged that the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh State government are shielding the accused in the Hathras rape case while trying to intimidate the victim’s family and their supporters.

A rally was taken out by the Left parties and peoples’ organisations from Saraswati Park to Gandhi statue near GVMC in protest against the growing incidents of violence and sexual assault against women and Dalits.

Addressing the participants, Mr. Murthy alleged that the BJP leaders and MLAs were trying to portray rapes and crimes against women as a part of Indian culture, apart from promoting communalism, casteism and patriarchy. He condemned the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh for not allowing Opposition parties to show their support to the victim, while at the same time allowing people from an upper caste community to hold rallies in support of the accused.

“Not even a single FIR was registered against the accused, but 19 FIRs were registered against those who supported the victim,” Mr. Murthy said, alleging that journalists were also implicated in false cases.

110,2020/10/16,Abdul Kalam remembered on 89th birth anniversary,"The birth anniversary of former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was observed by the Bharatiya Janata Party here on Thursday.

BJP Parliamentary District president M. Raveendra recalled the contributions of Dr. Kalam to the nation and his simplicity despite holding high positions.

Dr. Kalam was born on October 15, 1931 in a middle-class family. He obtained a degree in aeronautical engineering from IIT-Madras in 1958 and aspired to become a fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force. However, he lost the opportunity by a whisker as he finished ninth in the recruitment round while there were only eight posts, Mr. Raveendra said.

Dr. Kalam then joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and later shifted to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969, and became Project Director of the Satellite Launch Vehicle III (SLV-3) project, which was carried out with the first indigenously-designed rocket.

Later, Dr. Kalam became the 11th President of India during NDA rule. His name was proposed by the NDA government and the Congress Party had also extended support, and he became President in 2002.

On completion of his tenure as President, Dr. Kalam took to his favourite pastime of teaching students across the country. He breathed his last while teaching students of IIM-Shillong on July 27, 2015.

114,2020/10/16,Govt. credits ₹36.57 cr. input subsidy to flood-hit farmers,"Chief Minister holds meeting with top officials of 12 affected districts

To provide relief to farmers who have lost crops in floods, the State government credited ₹36.57 crore into 51,810 accounts of farmers as input subsidy on Friday.

The amount was transferred to the accounts online. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa held a videoconference with the Deputy Commissioners (DCs) and the Chief Executive Officers of zilla panchayats of 12 districts to take stock of the flood situation in Kalyana Karnataka districts.

The Chief Minister instructed the DCs to take all steps on a war footing to save lives and properties of the people affected by floods. A sum of ₹85.49 crore has been released for undertaking emergency measures in the flood-affected districts.

Owing to cyclone in the Bay of Bengal, Kalaburagi, Bidar, Yadgir, Ballari, Raichur, Bagalkot, Davangere, Koppal, Dakshina Kannada, Shivamogga, Udupi, Vijayapura, and Belagavi districts have received widespread rain, resulting in inundation of low- lying areas and loss of standing kharif crops, according to a press release from the Chief Minister’s Office.

115,2020/10/16,Old rivalry back to the fore as Kumaraswamy and Shivakumar shadowbox,"The outcome of the byelections in Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituencies may not be crucial to the stability of the BJP government in Karnataka, but it is being keenly watched for the tussle under way for the Vokkaliga leadership.

Both constituencies having sizeable Vokkaliga votes has resulted in a kind of shadowboxing between former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy and Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar. Interestingly, neither is taking each other’s name so far in their fight to grab Vokkaliga eyeballs.

Long turf war

The two families, which have had a long history of turf battle, had come together only when the Congress-JD(S) coalition government was formed. But the old rivalry is back now, after the fall of that government. Old-timers will recall the historic 2004 electoral battle in which Tejaswini Gowda (then with the Congress and now with the BJP), backed by Mr. Shivakumar, defeated JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda.

This byelection is the first electoral outing for Mr. Shivakumar as KPCC chief, and he and his brother and MP D.K Suresh are out to prove their mettle, especially in the R.R. Nagar seat that the Congress held earlier. JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy, meanwhile, has to at least retain the Sira seat.

R.R. Nagar is also part of the Bengaluru Rural Lok Sabha constituency that Mr. Suresh represents. On Friday, Mr. Shivakumar met Kannada Rakshna Vedike president Narayan Gowda, who has an influence in Vokkaliga pockets.

The precipitating factor for the public exchange between the two leaders, JD(S) sources said, was Mr. Kumaraswamy’s anger at Mr. Shivakumar’s move to poach their local Vokkaliga leaders. In Sira, JD(S) leader Kalkere Ravi, husband of Tumakuru Zilla Panchayat president Latha Ravi, has joined the Congress along with few others. JD(S) leaders claim that Mr. Ravi moved because the Congress, which partners with the JD(S) in the ZP, planned to move a no-confidence motion against his wife. In R.R Nagar, a few JD(S) leaders, including the locally influential leader Bettaswamy, have moved to the Congress.

But, playing down these migrations, Mr. Kumaraswamy said, “I am not rattled by a few people leaving the party. That is common during elections. The party’s base will not be eroded.” He went on to attack Mr. Shivakumar, but without taking his name. The issue also resonated at the JD(S) meeting in R.R. Nagar on Thursday. T.A. Sharavana, JD(S) spokesman, accused Mr. Shivakumar of trying to consolidate the Vokkaligas by playing the caste card.

Covert pitch

The larger issue at play appears to be that the JD(S), which draws its support from among the Vokkaligas in Old Mysore region, is feeling the heat as Mr. Shivakumar is trying to cut into the party by making a covert caste pitch. The Congress camp sees Mr. Shivakumar as a Vokkaliga leader who can threaten the JD(S) base and identity.

However, Mr. Shivakumar has been careful not to be upfront and antagonistic on the matter. So far, he has not attacked JD(S) leaders publicly, and has said that he does not do politics based on caste. “It is natural during elections for parties to attract those who believe in the party ideology and leadership,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/17vkpp/article32876497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGHDKDKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/old-rivalry-back-to-the-fore-as-kumaraswamy-and-shivakumar-shadowbox/article32876498.ece

122,2020/10/16,Child marriage complaints increased in May,"ChildLine received 579 plaints that month, of which 107 were from Ballari

The number of complaints received pertaining to child marriages during the pandemic in Karnataka was the highest in May this year, reveals data from ChildLine 1098.

Of the 579 complaints it got in May, it was able to intervene and stop 542 children from being forced into marriage. As many as 107 complaints were from Ballari alone.

Barring complaints made in June, data from April to September was made available (see table). Activists and counsellors attribute the surge in calls in May to the lockdown. The numbers started falling in the subsequent months as restrictions eased.

While it received 214 complaints in August, the number dropped to 111 in September. The highest number of complaints in September came from Bengaluru Rural.

Fr. Antony Sebastian, chairperson of Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR), said the number of complaints pertaining to child marriages were on the rise as the monitoring mechanism was not effective, with most officials being involved in COVID-19 duties. “People were also under the impression that this can be kept as a secret during the pandemic and they will not be held accountable,” he said. He added that people were facing several financial hardships during the pandemic and many particularly in rural areas felt that the marriage can be conducted with a minimum cost.

However, Vasudev Sharma, executive director, Child Rights Trust, said that increase in the number of complaints was a result of a surge in reporting. “The general awareness is more and people are coming forward to complain. It does not mean that the numbers of child marriages are on the rise,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1f7ds1/article32876259.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGOctChild-marriagecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/child-marriage-complaints-increased-in-may/article32876260.ece

130,2020/10/16,Tourism sector pins hopes on Dasara holidays,"The sector has already been seeing signs of revival

The Gandhi Jayanti weekend was an optimism booster for the tourism industry, sections of which saw positive sentiment among travellers rising. And now, they are pinning their hopes on the upcoming big festive days during Dasara and Deepavali for further relief to a sector that has been battered by the pandemic.

The sector has already been seeing signs of revival. “Weekend travelling as well as occupancy level in KSTDC have improved since September 15 across the State, but most prominently for Madikeri, Nandi Hills, Jog falls, Srirangapatna, Almatti and Badami,” said Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) Managing Director Kumar Pushkar.

“With regard to Dasara, we do not anticipate any surge, as the authorities have decided to keep celebrations low-key to ensure that the festival does not become the reason for spread of the pandemic. Yet, during Dasara holidays, local people will definitely travel, leading to some impetus to the tourism sector,” he said.

Sandeep Keshav Thamankar, proprietor of a tour company, said homestays in Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru and Sakleshpur were fully booked during October 1 to 4. “Travellers don't want to take cabs. They are contacting homestays directly. Hotels are not doing as well. In fact, there are no enquiries for north India due to the fear factor. Nobody is going through tour operators, unless they need a vehicle and accommodation,” he said.

He added that Dasara may not attract too many tourists this time, as there have been few enquiries due to the low-key celebrations.

Arun Ramachandran, owner of a homestay in Chikkamagaluru, said business has been picking up “very well” since a month or so. “People are not taking cabs. Many are indulging in budget travel due to pay cuts,” he said.

Among the changes initiated to accommodate the higher number of tourists amidst the pandemic, many homestay owners like Ramachandran are doing away with common campfires, instead making it a first-come-first-served basis.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jts2jd/article32864614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGTOURISTP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tourism-sector-pins-hopes-on-dasara-holidays/article32864615.ece
131,2020/10/16,Tourism sector opposes restrictions during Dasara,"They are against the closure of tourist places

Stakeholders in the tourism sector are up in arms against the decision of Rohini Sindhoori, Deputy Commissioner of Mysuru, to close places of tourist interest during Dasara.

The Deputy Commissioner announced the decision on Wednesday as a measure to stem the surge in COVID-19 cases in the district. She said Mysuru has over 6,800 active cases and congregation would result in a major surge and affect the community at large, and hence the fresh restrictions on tourism.

But Mysuru Travels Association (MTA), a body of local stakeholders in the tourism sector, has taken strong exception and said that the tourism industry – which was the worst affected due to COVID-19 lockdown – had begun to revive but this decision would ruin the sector beyond recovery.

MTA president Prashanth said they will appeal to the DC to lift the ban and also take up the matter with elected representatives of the district.

The graded unlocking has led to a gradual increase in tourist footfall in the district. Some of the places of tourist interest in and around Mysuru were receiving 30% of the normal footfall, according to the MTA. “Many hotels and travel agencies have begun hiring. The sector was hoping for a gradual turnaround in the weeks ahead,” said Narayan Gowda, president, Hotel Owners Association.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tourism-sector-opposes-restrictions-during-dasara/article32865429.ece
132,2020/10/16,Plans on to revive Kollegal silk,"Project expected to benefit traditional weavers in the region

Kollegal in Chamarajanagar district, renowned for silk weaving, may soon see a revival of its looms and a surge in demand for the silk saris as the district administration has chalked out major plans for revitalising the sector.

Apart from a ₹20-lakh budget for creating new infrastructure, the district administration will also take up cluster development to encourage silk looms and create a smart handloom outlet for the benefit of weavers in Kollegal.

A stakeholders’ meeting was convened recently by Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi, who initiated the concept, and nine weaving cooperative societies agreed to come together to take the initiative forward.

Mr. Ravi said the smart handloom outlet would be established at the old CMC office of the town and a detailed project report would be submitted to the lead bank for securing loans and financial assistance to implement the project.

He said it was estimated to cost around ₹20 lakh to put the infrastructure in place and that the potential for job creation and income generation was immense. The need of the hour was to create new design patterns to cater to the taste of the modern-day consumers, and in-house designers would be co-opted by cooperative societies to spin attractive saris, said Mr. Ravi.

Centralised outlet

A centralised outlet for sale of saris is at the core of creating a demand for the Kollegal silk, which used to occupy a pride of place among consumers of the region. Besides, Kollegal silk was popular in the neighbouring Tamil Nadu till recently and efforts would be made to trigger and rekindle its appeal. The product would also be promoted extensively among consumers in Karnataka. “We intend to create a brand for Kollegal silk on the lines of Mysore Silk,” said Mr. Ravi.

The revival initiative is part of a drive to promote sectors that traditionally had a strong base in Chamarajanagar and textile is one of them. This is expected to give a fillip to local industries besides empowering the community. Efforts would be made for online promotion and marketing of the products and e-catalogue of designs would also be prepared.

As part of its long-term strategy for extensive marketing, retail outlets dealing with Kollegal silk products would be established across all districts of the State on the lines of khadi. Such stalls would also be established in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, as per the master plan for Kollegal silk revival.

Artisans will be exposed to latest designs and encouraged to attend workshops so as to get a feel of the customers’ tastes and preferences. Mr. Ravi said the government envisaged large-scale job creation. To start with, at least 400 people would benefit from the project and the turnover — on an initial spinning of around 3,000 saris — was expected to be around ₹1.58 crore, which can multiple manifold once an extensive marketing network was established to fuel demand, the Deputy Commissioner added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8bxbcs/article32866629.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGSARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/plans-on-to-revive-kollegal-silk/article32866630.ece

134,2020/10/16,"Sugarcane growers demand SAP of ₹3,300 a tonne","The State government’s talks with sugarcane growers on fixing the State advisory price (SAP) for sugarcane for 2020–21 remained inconclusive as the growers demanded SAP of ₹3,300 for a tonne.

Sugar and Labour Minister Shivaram Hebbar chaired a meeting with growers and officials on Thursday to discuss the SAP for the October–September 2020–21 crushing season. Following a demand for higher SAP, Mr. Hebbar promised to fix the price in a week after talks with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa.

The Centre has fixed the fair and remunerative price at ₹2,850 a tonne for a recovery rate of 10% and additional ₹285 a tonne if the recovery rate is one percentage point higher, at 11%, for 2020–21.

In a memorandum to Mr. Hebbar, Karnataka State Sugarcane Growers Association president Kurubur Shanthakumar said that growers incur expenditure of ₹3,050 for producing a tonne of cane owing to increased labour and input costs. Moreover, factories show less recovery rate and cheat growers, he said.

Factories in Kalaburagi, Belagavi, and Bagalkot have not paid the SAP rates for growers, he alleged, and demanded payment of pending dues with 15% interest. He also urged the government to register criminal cases against factories for providing wrong information on payments made to growers.

Some factories deduct ₹5,000 for every payment of ₹1 lakh to growers citing harvest cost incurred by them, he said. Further, farmers have been denied the share in profits earned by factories from byproducts such as molasses and ethanol, Mr. Shanthakumar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sugarcane-growers-demand-sap-of-3300-a-tonne/article32866594.ece
135,2020/10/16,Bypolls: Parties brace themselves for low voter turnout amid pandemic,"Women and elderly, considered committed voters, have not shown enthusiasm in the two segments

As electioneering gets under way for the bypolls in Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituencies, political parties are keeping their fingers crossed over the voter turnout despite their efforts during the next fortnight. For, the parties are struggling to reach out to the voter in times of COVID-19.

Women, who are considered to be committed voters by the parties and hold key to victory, along with those aged above 60, are expected to turn up in lesser numbers fearing contracting coronavirus. Even the campaigns are expected to be limited.

Though parties have tapped social media, especially WhatsApp, sources across parties said they are bracing for a lower turnout, and believe that a clear picture could emerge a few days before the polling day.

In the 2018 Assembly polls, Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar had reported a voter turnout of 84% and 54%, respectively. The Election Commission is also looking at the political parties to mobilise voters for the election.

“We really have to struggle to motivate voters to come and vote on the polling day. As of now, we have seen very little enthusiasm from women workers on ground in Sira. Things are picking up in R.R. Nagar as the Mahila Morcha is involved in campaigning. The voter turnout is definitely expected to come down,” Congress spokesperson Muralidhar Halappa said. He said that most of the women workers, who normally come out for campaigning, have stayed away so far. In R.R. Nagar, an urban pocket, the turnout has been traditionally low and it could go down further this time, he added.

Candidate with COVID-19

The Janata Dal (Secular), which is looking at retaining the Sira seat after its legislator B. Satyanarayana passed away, has had an early start in campaigning. However, the camp has its own problem. The party’s candidate, Ammajamma, the wife of the deceased legislator, is in hospital owing to COVID 19 and the former Minister H.D. Revanna filed the nomination paper on her behalf. Party sources said that despite having a good presence in the constituency, they were also witnessing a muted participation of workers. “Many may stay away from polling since they have to wait at the polling stations, and they fear they could contract the virus,” sources said.

However, though BJP spokesperson Ganesh Karnik acknowledged that political parties are finding it difficult to reach out to people, they have resorted to reaching the doorstep of the voters in Sira and R.R. Nagar. “There is a limitation on public gathering, which has restricted the parties’ reach. As a cadre-based party, we have started going on house-to-house campaign,” he said, adding that the BJP expects a good turnout despite the pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5pu4le/article32866583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGSIRA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bypolls-parties-brace-themselves-for-low-voter-turnout-amid-pandemic/article32866584.ece
136,2020/10/16,Cinemas in North Karnataka to remain shut,"Although the State government permitted reopening of single screen cinemas and multiplexes on Thursday in accordance with the Unlock 5.0 guidelines, cinemas across North Karnataka remained shut following a decision by film exhibitors against reopening them.

This is in accordance with the decision taken by the Karnataka Film Exhibitors Federation (KFEF) on not screening films till the government fulfilled its demands, including changes in the renewal fee and others. KFEF has around 500 members spread across North Karnataka.

KFEF president Rangangouda R. Odugouda has said that KFEF was forced to take the decision as the government had hiked renewal fee by manifolds. The renewal fee, which used to be ₹ 5,000 annually, had now been hiked to ₹ 1.25 lakh per year.

In the present system, cinema owners have to pay in advance and non-refundable amount to film producers to which KFEF has taken exception.

Mr. Odugoudar told The Hindu that they would want a system wherein exhibitors and film producers have a “win-win” situation by running shows on percentage basis.

Meanwhile, COVID-19 safety protocols are also likely to increase the maintenance cost of the cinemas. As per the advisory, cinemas have to be sanitised after every show, social distancing has to be maintained, and occupancy should be only 50 % of the total seats.

He said that so far there had been no communication either from the government or from the producers association on their demands. He made it clear that unless their demands were met, they would not screen films.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/psk0ga/article32866526.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16HBHUBBALLICINEMAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cinemas-in-north-karnataka-to-remain-shut/article32866527.ece

Standing crops such as paddy, cotton and red gram on several thousands of acres of land were inundated in floodwaters.

The backwaters of the Bhima entered paddy fields in Yadgir and Wadagera taluks in Yadgir districts and Ganjall and Korthakunda villages in Raichur district. Several hundreds of electricity pumpsets were washed away in fast flowing river waters. Road connectivity between Kalaburagi and Yadgir via Wadi, Nalwar was cut off after a bridge near Malagatti was submerged in the Kagina river.

As many as 74 houses have partially collapsed and 1,300 hectares of agriculture land with standing crops are under rainwater in Yadgir district. Thousands of electricity poles are surrounded by river waters. However, there is no report on the death of animals and sheep and damage to electricity cables and transformers.

Deputy Commissioner of Yadgir R. Ragapriya visited the Gursunagi bridge-cum-barrage across the Bhima river near Yadgir and inspected the situation as the river has been flowing with high quantum of water since yesterday after officials discharged more than a lakh cusecs of water from the Sannati Bridge-cum- Barrage.

138,2020/10/16,"Despite a lull in rain, floods keeping people on tenterhooks","Kalaburagi administration preparing to shift 148 villages, as discharge from Maharashtra is expected to go up to 7.5 lakh cusecs

Though heavy rain that lashed Kalaburagi and surrounding areas for the last two days receded on Thursday, floods continued to wreak havoc along the course of major rivers, especially the Bhima, in the district due to heavy rain in their catchment areas in neighbouring Maharashtra.

A heavy discharge of water from the Ujjani and the Veer reservoirs in Maharashtra caused floods along the Bhima river course in the district on Thursday.

As per information provided by the district administration, the inflow in the Sonna Barrage built across the Bhima in Afzalpur taluk increased from 1,98,000 cusecs in the morning to 5,11,000 cusecs in the evening on Thursday. The authorities increased the discharge of water from the barrage from 2.23 lakh cusecs in the morning to 5,11,000 cusecs in the evening. The heavy discharge from the barrage has flooded thousands of acres of land with standing crops along the Bhima river course in Afzalpur, Jewargi, Chittapur and Sedam taluks.

Since the discharge from Maharashtra reservoirs is expected to increase to 7.5 lakh cusecs late on Thursday, Deputy Commissioner of Kalaburagi Vijaya Jyothsna has directed the officials to shift 148 villages situated mainly along the banks of the Bhima.

Since the Bhima was dangerously overflowing, the Katti Sangavi bridge near Jewargi was closed for traffic as a precautionary measure. The bridge near Saradagi was also submerged cutting off connectivity between Vijayapura and Kalaburagi. The submergence of the Boratagi bridge in Maharashtra has cut off connectivity between Afzalpur and Solapur.

The Kagina continued to be in spate on Thursday as well flooding large tracts of land along its banks. The Uttaradi Math in Malkhed remained flooded for the third day in a row. The submergence of Malkhed bridge on the Kagina continued to keep connectivity between Kalaburagi and Hyderabad severed for the third day. The submergence of the Dandoti bridge has cut off connectivity between Chittapur and Kalaburagi.

The Archaeological Survey of India site on the banks of the Bhima at Sannati in Chittapur taluk where ancient Buddhist and Asokan edicts exist was also partially flooded. There were reports that people in over 40 villages were stranded on the roofs of their houses surrounded by floodwaters and crying for help.

Initiating action, Ms. Vijaya Jyothsna has directed key officials to stay at the district administrative complex in Kalaburagi on Thursday night to monitor the flood situation and take necessary action. She has asked the officials to have proper coordination with local level functionaries such as village accountants and panchayat development officers and arrange for boats, ambulances and rescue vehicles.

In a video message, Ms. Jyothsna appealed to the people not to panic.

“The continued rainfall coupled with heavy discharges from Maharashtra reservoirs has caused floods in Kalaburagi. We have already declared a red alert in the district. We have engaged two NDRF teams for rescuing people stranded in different places. Over 150 people have been rescued in the last two days.

Talking to reporters, Mr. Kumar said religious leaders, after entering politics, should not make use of their saffron robes or their caste. The BJP was unnecessarily bringing up caste and spreading hatred by highlighting the statement of Mr. Rai, he said.

ISHA Outreach, which manages the ‘Cauvery Calling’ project spearheaded by ISHA Foundation, had complained to the court that the petitioner, on August 21, sent an email to Discovery Channel warning that telecasting the documentary, scheduled to be aired on August 22 at 6.30 p.m., would amount to contempt of court as the legality of the project was sub judice. Following the petitioner’s email, the channel indefinitely postponed airing the documentary.

The Bench said that the petitioner could not have decided whether the telecast of documentary, titled ‘Cauvery Calling — a race to save a river’, would amount to contempt of court. The petitioner, if he wanted to object to the telecast of the programme, should have adopted “an appropriate remedy instead of virtually threatening the channel”, the Bench observed.

The Bench also noted that though it gave an opportunity to the petitioner to explain his conduct, he had virtually justified his action and not shown any remorse over his conduct.

Stating that the court cannot allow such conduct by a person who files a petition in public interest, the Bench said it cannot allow the petitioner to continue to be associated with the litigation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-dislodges-petitioner-in-cauvery-calling-plea-for-virtually-threatening-tv-channel/article32865995.ece
144,2020/10/16,Fear of flood persists in Karnataka with water discharge from Maharashtra,"Heavy rains and flooding in the northern districts of the State since Sunday have resulted in six deaths, the latest being that of Shivaputra Natikar, 30, who was washed away in a swollen stream at Mulasavalgi village of Vijayapura district on Wednesday night.

Kalaburagi, Bagalkot, Raichur, and Vijayapura have seen heavy rains over the week. Though the downpour subsided on Thursday, continued rains in parts of Maharashtra led to increased inflow into the rivers in Karnataka, resulting in greater discharge from reservoirs in Karnataka.

With huge quantities of water being discharged from the Ujjani and Veer reservoirs in Maharashtra, the inflow at Sonna Barrage in Kalaburagi district increased to 5,11,000 cusecs, forcing the authorities to maintain the same outflow level, leading to inundation of vast tracts of lands with standing crops in Afzalpur, Jewargi, Chittapur, and Sedam taluks. Deputy Commissioner Vijaya Jyothsna has directed officials to evacuate residents in 148 villages along the river bank.

Meanwhile, inundation of bridges and barrages has affected connectivity between Kalaburagi and Hyderabad, between Kalaburagi and Vijayapura, and between Kalaburagi and Jewargi. Similarly, connectivity between Kalaburagi and Yadgir via Wadi, Nalwar, has been cut off after the bridge near Malagatti was submerged in the Kagina river. Standing crops on 1,300 hectares of agricultural land in Yadgir district have been destroyed.

Family rescued

Meanwhile, police and Fire and Emergency personnel rescued four farm labourers and their cattle caught in an overflowing stream at Boodihal village of Vijayapura district on Thursday. Shivappa Mural and his wife and children had gone to work in a field on Wednesday night. After spending the night on the farm waiting for the rain to subside, they tried to cross the stream on Thursday, but were caught in the current. On being alerted by locals, the police and fire personnel pulled the family to safety using ropes, tahshildar Sanjiv Dasar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fear-of-flood-persists-in-karnataka-with-water-discharge-from-maharashtra/article32865985.ece

As Registrar, the appellant was required to communicate the decisions of the University and the Vice-Chancellor, and the single-judge Bench had failed to notice that “except communicating faithfully the orders passed by the university, the appellant had not done anything beyond”.

146,2020/10/16,"Now, an alternative to the depleting drug Sarpagandha","Researchers from Arya Vaidya Sala find root of Rauvolfia tetraphylla having same biological properties

A team of researchers from the Centre for Medicinal Plants Research (CMPR) at the Arya Vaidya Sala, Kottakkal, has discovered a viable alternative for a depleting drug widely used for treatment of high blood pressure in Ayurveda.

The alternative for the famous drug Sarpagandha was found in a study that lasted several years. Sarpagandha is taken from the root of a plant named Rauvolfia serpentina or Indian snakeroot, and is a vital drug in Ayurveda used for high blood pressure, asthma, and insomnia.

It is a critically endangered species belonging to the family Apocynaceae. The Union Ministry of Environment and Forests has red-listed this plant following its overexploitation.

C.T. Sulaiman, senior scientist who led the research under Indira Balachandran, said that the shortage of Sarpagandha had begun to seriously affect Ayurveda drug industry in the country. “Some started using spurious drugs in the name of Sarpagandha because of its non-availability,” said Dr. Sulaiman.

The study found that the root of Rauvolfia tetraphylla, a plant belonging to the genus Rauvolfia, shared the same biological properties of Rauvolfia serpentina. “We could validate the similarity between those plants, and could suggest Rauvolfia tetraphylla as a viable alternative to Sarpagandha,” said Dr. Sulaiman.

The latest issue of Beni-Suef University Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences published by Springer Nature has carried the research findings of Dr. Sulaiman and team.

K.M. Prabhukumar, C.K. Jyothi, and Jinu Krishnan Unnithan were part of the team.

149,2020/10/16,Change in rainfall pattern reflects in Idukki dam,"Unexpected rise in water level in October

The unexpected rise in the water level in the Idukki reservoir in the middle of October has been attributed to the change in the rainfall pattern in the past few years.

The dam was opened after 26 years on August 9, 2018 and by October the water level had started to decline. The water level in the dam on October 16, 2018 was 2,387 ft and 2,376 ft the same day last year.

As per the data available with the Dam Monitoring and Research Station, Vazhathoppe, the water level usually remains stagnant or increases at a minor level during October. The northeast monsoon usually does not make much of an impact in the dam water level with power generation remaining low.

Despite the increased power generation, the water level in the reservoir continued to rise, reaching 2,393.36 ft on Friday. If there is heavy rainfall within two days, there are chances of the dam being opened as it is short of only 5 ft to the dam opening level of 2,398.85 ft as per the new rule curve level.

The cumulative rainfall in the catchment area from June 1 to October 16 in 2018 was 4,468 mm, the highest ever since the commissioning of the dam in 1977. The cumulative rainfall till October 16 this year was 2,702 mm. The power generation has been raised to 9.34 mu now.

A Kerala State Electricity Board official said the board might look at the option of opening the dam shutters in case of heavy rainfall in two days. There were also chances of the water level remaining under control after the generation was increased and the rainfall declining.

In 2013, 2007, 1992, and 1981, the water level had remained higher than the present level as on October 16. The figures being 2,396 ft, 2,397 ft, 2,399 ft, and 2,399 ft respectively. The shutters of the Idukki reservoir were opened in 1992 and 1981.

The new rule curve is set by the Central Water Commission in consideration of the likely changes in the rainfall pattern. The water level should not be allowed above the rule curve level and the option of reducing the water level remains open, the official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tbgnb3/article32876634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Idukki-Reservoir-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/change-in-rainfall-pattern-reflects-in-idukki-dam/article32876632.ece
150,2020/10/16,School launches its greening drive at students’ homes,"Students of Alappuzha school have planted 3,000 saplings, target 10,000

People have been trying a lot of things to cope with the difficult times in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The students of Devaswom Board Higher Secondary School (DBHSS), Cheriyanad, are finding solace in planting saplings of fruit-bearing trees. Around 600 students from class V to class 10 of the school have so far planted 3,000 saplings on the premises of their houses as part of a drive titled Haritham Harithabham, launched by the school recently. They plan to plant 10,000 saplings before the reopening of schools.

G. Radhakrishnan, a teacher and convener of National Green Corps, DBHSS, says the plantation drive is helping students enjoy their environs apart from increasing the green cover. “Students are spending a lot of time on internet because of online classes. For them, planting and tending to saplings is a way to relax. When the initiative was launched, we urged them to plant two saplings each. Some planted five or more. A few students who lacked space at their houses planted saplings at their relatives’ homes. Such is the response to the drive,” says Mr. Radhakrishnan.

Guidance from school

While school authorities provide the guidance with the help of a retired agriculture officer, the students should find the saplings. After planting saplings, students share photographs on the school WhatsApp groups. “I planted four saplings of jackfruit, mango, rambutan and coconut last week. I hope to nurture them into trees with the support of my family,” says, Nandana S., a class 10 student of DBHSS.

Cash awards

The school authorities are keen to ensure that the drive is not just about planting and posing for photograph. “We have urged the students to grow the plants organically and protect them with tree guards. Once the school is reopened, teachers will visit the houses of students. All students who participated in the drive will be given certificates. Students who nurtured the plants well will be given cash awards,” says Mr. Radhakrishnan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/js4by9/article32876569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17tval1--DBHSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/school-launches-its-greening-drive-at-students-homes/article32876570.ece

A team of Customs officers rushed M. Sivasankar, the former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, to a private hospital here after he complained of uneasiness on Friday evening.

The officers had reportedly arrived at the IAS officer's house to escort him to the Customs House here. The hospital authorities admitted Mr. Sivasankar to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit after he complained of chest pain. An initial report suggested that the doctors had diagnosed Mr. Sivasankar with elevated blood pressure and an erratic heart rate.

The Customs reportedly wanted to question Mr. Sivasankar on suspicion of aiding gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh to spirit away a vast sum of foreign currency from the country to Dubai during one of their alleged joint travel.

It was unclear whether the agency has named Mr. Sivasankar as an accused in the currency smuggling case under the provisions of the Customs Act or wanted to arrest him.

The Customs was reportedly in possession of statements from Swapna's accomplices in the economic offence that she used her trips with Mr. Sivasankar to Dubai as a cover for foreign currency smuggling.

The agency ""suspected"" that the currency smuggling could be a component of a hawala operation to compensate the Dubai end of the international gold smuggling racket. An investigator said Mr. Sivasankar's presence could have given Swapna a measure of cover for her alleged illegal activities.

153,2020/10/16,"GST: State welcomes offer, but wants to raise borrowing","Centre’s decision to borrow through a special window and provide back-to-back loans to States

Even while welcoming the Centre’s decision to borrow through a special window and provide back-to-back loans to the States in lieu of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation, Kerala is putting pressure to borrow ₹1.70 lakh crore instead of the present offer of ₹1.1 lakh crore.

Kerala that had led the States to oppose the Centre’s twin options on GST compensation is of the view that the total shortfall in the collection of GST estimated at ₹2.35 lakh crore should be provided this year itself. Out of the shortfall ₹1.1 lakh crore is on account of GST shortfall and remaining ₹60,000 crore due to the pandemic.

Deferred payment

“We have welcomed the Centre’s offer to borrow ₹1.1 lakh crore. The Centre has climbed down. The remaining ₹60,000 crore will be given to the States only in 2023. This issue has to be resolved. The Centre should discuss with the States on how much of compensation is to be deferred to 2023. Let us negotiate this point and reach a consensus,” Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac told The Hindu.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman who telephoned Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday from Delhi to drum up support for the Centre’s initiative was told that the State was welcoming the offer but wanted to enhance the borrowing to ₹1.7 lakh crore and about the benefits. Mr. Vijayan had also raised the demand in his reply to the letter written by Ms. Sitharaman later in the day.

Kerala which has been opposing the COVID-19 factor is putting pressure on the Finance Ministry to enhance the borrowing as it will not have any impact on the fiscal deficit of the government.

“Since under the new arrangement, the additional borrowing will not affect the fiscal deficit of the Centre, why is the Centre not ready to borrow ₹1.7 lakh crore instead of the present offer of ₹1.1 lakh crore,” asks Dr. Isaac.

State hopeful

The State is hopeful that the Centre will yield to the demand in view of the move to approach the Supreme Court on Centre’s arbitrary decision on the vexed issue as the GST council had not taken a decision after three meetings.

The Chief Minister has convened a meeting of the officials of the Finance and Law Departments on Saturday to discuss the issue. “We have only welcomed, but not accepted it,” Dr. Isaac said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gst-state-welcomes-offer-but-wants-to-raise-borrowing/article32875960.ece

The Kerala High Court refused to interfere in the State government directive to the Kottayam District Collector to begin the proceedings to acquire the Cheruvally Estate for the Sabarimala greenfield airport.

At the same time, the court stayed the government directive to the District Collector to deposit the compensation for acquiring the land in a court as mandated by the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.

It was on a petition moved by Ayana Charitable Trust that the Single Judge of the Kerala High Court issued the order.

The State government had identified the 2263.13 acres for an airport, which was earlier in the possession of Harrisons Malayalam Plantation. Earlier, the attempts of the State government to take over the holding was stayed by the High Court and the Supreme Court.

Pronouncing the order on Friday, the Single Judge noted that the government was bound to conduct an investigation into the social impact of the acquisition of the land. The social impact study included an assessment related to the public purpose of the proposed acquisition, the order said.

An expert group has to give an opinion to the State government whether the project would serve the pubic purpose or not. Thereafter, the government should examine the expert opinion to arrive at a final decision as to the bona fide public purpose for the project. It was only after completing these steps that the government was empowered to issue publication of the primary notification for the acquisition, the court noted.

According to Fr. Sijo Panthappallil, official spokesperson of the church, the church approached the High Court as the State government had intended to take over the property without acknowledging its ownership rights on the land. “Now that the matter is settled, the government may approach us through proper channel seeking to take over the property,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-stays-directive-to-deposit-compensation/article32875778.ece

Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan on Friday asked Kerala Congress (M) [KC(M)] legislators P.J. Joseph and Mons Joseph to show cause why the Assembly should not disqualify them for “violating” the party whip.

Mr. Sreeramakrishnan said he had received a complaint from KC(M) leader Roshy Augustine, MLA, that the lawmakers had violated the party whip to boycott the UDF-sponsored no-confidence motion against the LDF government.

Mr. Augustine and N. Jayaraj, MLA, of the Jose K. Mani faction of the KC(M), along with Mr. Mani, had deserted the UDF recently.

Complaint

Mr. Sreeramakrishnan said his office had also received a complaint from Mons Joseph that Mr. Augustine and Mr. Jayaraj had violated the party whip by staying away from the voting, thus favouring the treasury benches during the no-confidence motion.

157,2020/10/16,KC(M) base no more anti-communist: CPM,"Pope’s encyclicals critical of global capitalism, increasing wealth gap

CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on Friday said the traditional support base of the Kerala Congress (M) in Central Travancore had abandoned their anti-communist attitude that had benefitted the UDF for long.

He said the CPI(M) State secretariat, which discussed Jose. K. Mani’s possible entry into the LDF, also weighed the encyclicals of Pope Francis.

The Pope had repeatedly criticised the excesses of global capitalism and the wealth gap it had created in society. Pope Francis had also noted how global capitalism had wreaked havoc on the life of ordinary people, chiefly farmers.

He said the Pope’s message might also have influenced Mr Mani’s decision to work in league with the LDF. The decision also indicated a seismic shift in the political thinking of traditional UDF voters. They had opted for the LDF given its opposition to the anti-farmer policies of the Centre. LDF’s secular politics rooted in progressive ethos was a big draw for voters resentful of the dalliance of the UDF with the Sangh Parivar.

158,2020/10/16,Prosecution fears unfair trial in actor rape case,"May move HC to shift trial to another court

Apprehending that the victim in the actor rape case “will not get fair trial and justice,” the Special Public Prosecutor has moved the court to stop the proceedings and shift the trial to another court.

A. Sureshan, the Special Public Prosecutor, submitted before the Additional Special Sessions Court (SPE/CBI)-3, Ernakulam, stop the proceedings to enable him to approach the High Court to transfer the trial to any other court in the “interest of justice.”

The prosecution feared that justice would be denied to the victim if the case was tried in the present court. He submitted that the court was “highly biased,’’ which is detrimental to the judicial system.

He submitted that the “trial of the case will be fair only if the judicial mind is uninfluenced by any extraneous matters. The conduct of the court to read out anonymous letter in the open court and make remarks is opposed to fair trail and fairness of the judicial system,” he submitted.

The prosecutor also complained that the court made some derogatory remarks, comments and baseless allegations against the prosecution and the Special Prosecutor. The court also made a few comments and remarks, which were not mentioned in the petition, for protecting the interest of justice, he submitted.

At the same time, legal sources maintained that the trial was being conducted in a fair and balanced way as envisioned by law. Neither the victim nor the women witnesses who were examined in the case had ever raised any concern regarding the fairness of trail. The trial will have to be completed within the time frame fixed by law and the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court, sources said.

Mr. Sureshan, when contacted, said the Director General of Prosecution (DGP) was informed about the events before moving the petition in the court.

Responding to the developments, the Registry of the Kerala High Court said it had not formally received any complaints in this regard. However, the registry would look into what transpired in the court, judicial sources said.

DGP Manjeri Sreedharan Nair said he had only unofficial knowledge about the issue. The petition should have been moved after the DGP clearing it.

159,2020/10/16,KC(M) entry likely as Mani meets LDF leaders,"His shift create rumblings in both fronts

The optics of Kerala Congress(M) leader Jose K. Mani’s high-profile visits to the headquarters of two major constituents of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) on Friday appeared to convey the impression that his entry into the ruling front was a certainty.

Mr. Mani drove to the CPI headquarters at MN Smarakam from the AKG Centre. He met CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran and later closeted himself with CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and LDF convenor A. Vijayaraghavan.

A phalanx of reporters tailed Mr. Mani who later expressed optimism that the LDF would open its door for the KC(M) ahead of the local body polls.

However, Mr. Mani’s optimism seemed to be at odds with the rumblings of discontent his political shift had purportedly kindled in the opposing fronts.

A State committee meeting of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in Kochi, an LDF ally, reportedly signalled that it was averse to sacrificing any of its three Assembly seats, including the ‘hard-won’ Pala held by Mani. C. Kappan, to satisfy Mr. Mani.

Mr. Balakrishnan dismissed the report and said disappointment awaited those who hoped for a mutiny in the ruling front. NCP was in lockstep with the LDF. Give and take was the linchpin of coalition politics. Seat adjustments were usual, he said.

The Congress also appeared to feel the aftermath of Mr. Mani’s abandonment of the UDF. K. Muraleedharan, MP, blamed the party leadership for failing to keep Mr. Mani in the coalition. A trivial dispute over a district panchayat chairmanship on the eve of the local body polls had cost the UDF a long-standing partner.

Mr. Muraleedharan’s public statement seemed to have caught the UDF by surprise as it struggled to come to terms with Mr. Mani’s defection. His pronouncement seemed to cast doubts on the UDF’s public stance that Mr. Mani’s desertion would not sway its traditional base in Central Travancore. KPCC president Mullapally Ramachandran said Mr. Mani’s faction was a spent force. He reminded Mr. Muraleedharan that the Congress had welcomed him and late K. Karunakaran despite their desertion of the party in 2005.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/e5rjfp/article32878466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TVMANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/manis-entry-into-ldf-seems-a-given/article32875201.ece

Puzhakkal in the district has become the first child-friendly block panchayat in the State.

Activities initiated with the objective of child-friendly local governance fetched the block panchayat the honour.

Child-friendly local governance aims at ensuring rights of entire children. The Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA) started the initiative with the support of UNICEF. Puzhakkal block panchayat was selected in the initial stage itself.

161,2020/10/16,"Realise that you are public servants, CM tells police","2,279 armed constables complete training at Kerala Police Academy

The entire police force, from the bottom to top, should have the realisation that they are public servants, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

He was speaking on Friday after taking salute from 2,279 armed police constables, who completed training at the Kerala Police Academy, online. The passing-out parade was held at the Police Academy’s ground at Ramavarmapuram.

The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak occurred during the training period provided a special experience to the trainees, the Chief Minister noted. “The preventive mission against the pandemic is a social work taken up along with people. The current police training programme has a holistic approach. The change is visible. But isolated unfortunate incidents have been happening from the force. We have been keeping vigil against them,” he said.

State Police Chief Loknath Behera also received the salute online. Academy director B. Sandhya and DIG Neeraj Kumar Guptha received the salute at the academy.

On COVID duty

The trainees were deployed on COVID-19 Janamaithri police duty for three and a half months in various police stations during the lockdown period. They were part of COVID-19 awareness campaigns and community kitchen activities.

It was the first batch of armed police constables who completed an integrated training programme at the Integrated Police Recruitment Centre at the Police Academy.

162,2020/10/16,Kanayi denies using model for Yakshi,"‘Using models will defeat the very purpose of his efforts of 51 years’

Sculptor Kanayi Kunhiraman has denied using any model for the construction of his iconic statue Yakshi at Malampuzha garden.

It was reported that the legs of a woman named Nafeesa, who died over a week ago, had been used as a model for the construction of Yakshi. The report was on the basis of the statements made by two other workers involved in the construction of the celebrated statue.

Mr. Kunhiraman, in a statement, denied using the late Nafeesa as a model for Yakshi. “During the last 51 years of my active involvement in making sculptures, I never used any model for my works. The Malampuzha Yakshi is an imagination and there cannot be a model for it. I was always against using models by some western artists for their paintings,” he said.

The 83-year-old sculptor said that his aim was to evolve an Indian culture and art-based sculpture tradition. “For the sculptures in different places in Kerala such as Shangumugham, Veli, Kottayam and GCDA Kochi, I used the Indian traditional art, folk and temple architect (sic),” he said.

According to Mr. Kunhiraman, using a model for his statue will defeat the very purpose of his efforts of the 51 years, and will be against the values that he stood for.

“Malampuzha Yakshi was criticised by some people for its so-called obscene pose. But if you visit the temples, you could see many such obscene pose. Once you come out of the temple, you only appreciate its artistic value. So nudity is only in the mind. That is why Malampuzha Yakshi became so popular and hundreds of people come to see it every day,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kanayi-denies-using-model-for-yakshi/article32874852.ece
163,2020/10/16,‘Test-and-treat’ to tackle TB in kids,"Children aged below 15 constitute 5% of the TB cases in State

Children aged below 15 constitute 5% of the total number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the State. The Health Department is planning to launch a ‘test-and-treat’ approach and preventive therapy for them from next month.

The initiative is part of the recently launched Akshaya Keralam project, the third phase of a drive to eliminate TB by 2025, according to the State TB cell.

As many as 15,307 cases have been diagnosed between January and September this year and 968 people died. The corresponding figures for 2019 were 25,248 and 1,821, respectively.

Sources at the cell claimed that 561 of the 1,034 local self-government institutions had not reported a single case of paediatric TB in 2019. Average annual decline in childhood TB cases from 2009 to 2019 had been 7.5% .

Drop in drug sale

Paediatric anti-TB drug sale had a steeper decline. Pharmaceuticals reported a dip in the sale of kid formulations by 90% from 2006 to 2019.

The preventive therapy is meant to reduce it further, they pointed out. This is expected to prevent 1,000 children getting TB every year in the State. The Kerala branch of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics is a partner in the venture.

Meanwhile, the officials said that TB elimination efforts had faced some trouble after the spread of COVID-19. Fear of transmission of the infection to lab technicians through TB sputum examination, stigma to cough, and difficulty in accessing suspected patients were some of the issues.

Advisory issued

An advisory was issued for ensuring TB care in April. Laboratories were equipped with bio-safety equipment, and instruments for molecular tests like Truenat and Xperts which could test both TB and COVID-19 were additionally purchased. Bidirectional screening for TB and COVID were put in place, the officials said.

Following this, an estimated 1,500 cases were found to have missed diagnosis. The Akshaya Keralam project is an attempt to find out all those through a catch-up campaign. The search is for cases among vulnerable individuals at their homes along with reverse quarantine efforts in coordination with care for the elderly and palliative care.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/test-and-treat-to-tackle-tb-in-kids/article32874838.ece

The legislator was arraigned as the second accused in a cheating case booked by the Chandera police, Kasaragod.

The petitioner submitted that there was no prima facie case against him and the booking of the case amounted to abuse of process of law. The case was the result of a politically motivated action of the ruling front. A complaint of civil nature was registered under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, which amounted to the abuse of process of law, he submitted.

He submitted that the ruling front was using the complaint of some of the investors/shareholders of a company to influence the police to register criminal case against him.

He further submitted that he had not cheated anyone as the director or chairman of any company and had not withdrawn any amount from the company at any stage. No assets of the company were misused.

167,2020/10/16,A hundred green islands come up in Kollam,"10 hectares of fallow land greened under Pachathuruthu project

Various local bodies in the district have converted 10 hectares of fallow land into 100 green islands as part of the Pachathuruthu project, an initiative of the Haritha Keralam Mission. The Kollam Corporation alone has developed 23 natural green habitats and the authorities are planning to extend the project to all 55 wards. Ayyankali Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme (AUEGS) workers were in charge of preparing the land, planting and maintaining the biowall.

A stretch of land near the Kollam beach was transformed into a Pachathuruthu to prevent waste dumping in the area and the surrounding biowalls are expected to protect the islands from encroachment. At present, 38 local bodies is the district have developed natural and heterogeneous green patches full of endemic trees and plants. The authorities had identified fallow lands that also included public places after the project was announced.

Bags award

Karunagappally municipality that cultivated a herbal garden on the premises of Government Ayurveda Hospital bagged an award from the Haritha Keralam Mission. The local body has set aside 2 cents of land to grow the herbal garden while a mini forest similar to Mangalavanam in Kochi will come up in 40 cents of land attached to the municipal crematorium.

The bio-diverse green island will have bamboo, shrubs, herbs, trees and a biowall. The Kulathpuzha grama panchayat has grown three islands near post office, KSRTC stand, and handloom weaving centre.

Fruit trees at Alappad

Alappad grama panchayat that has been facing serious environmental threats has grown a mini forest of fruit-bearing trees on 2.5 acres of land that was lying idle after mineral sand-mining. The local body has also planted mangroves to protect the water sources in the region as part of the project.

The Social Forestry Division had provided the saplings required for the project and at present efforts are on to record the location, area, number of plants and species at each Pachathuruthu using satellite mapping with the help of the Kerala State IT Mission (KSITM).

The target of the project is one green island in every local body across the State. The Haritha Keralam Mission has issued specific guidelines for cultivating mini forests and expanding the green cover. Mostly indigenous varieties matching the topography of the place will be planted. In connection with the intensive drive, everything from thick natural forests spread in multiple acres to small green patches will come alive in land belonging to government, institutions, private parties, and puramboke.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tjl9pu/article32874374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17tvko-Pachathuruthu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-hundred-green-islands-come-up-in-kollam/article32874375.ece
168,2020/10/16,Exit of Jose faction unfortunate: Murali,"‘Will be disastrous for the faction in future’

Terming the exit of the Jose K. Mani faction from the United Democratic Front (UDF) as unfortunate, Congress leader K. Muraleedharan, MP, has said that two groups of Kerala Congress (M) should have compromised on the issue of district panchayat seat.

He told mediapersons here on Friday that the decision taken by Mr. Mani to align with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) would be disastrous for his faction in the long run. The CPI(M)-led LDF would play any dirty game to remain in power. People have not forgotten how when in the opposition benches its leaders behaved when former Finance minister K.M. Mani presented his budget in 2015, Mr. Muraleedharan said.

However, Mr. Muraleedharan maintained that the self-confidence of workers would be affected if more partners left the Congress-led coalition. There was a communication gap among the constituents in sorting out issues, he said.

Mr. Muraleedharan said the UDF had remained united and strong with leaders such as K.M. Mani, M.P. Veerendrakumar and R. Balakrishma Pillai. Now some of their inheritors were with the LDF, he said.

No party left the coalition when Congress leader K. Karunakaran was at the helm of affairs.

169,2020/10/16,Good response to night shelter facility,"Over 10,000 women and children have used the Ente Koodu facility in the capital and Kozhikode

More than 10,000 people have put up so far at Ente Koodu, night shelters started by the government for destitute women and children to ensure their safety.

The Ente Koodu shelter in Thiruvananthapuram has benefited over 7,000 women and children and that in Kozhikode 3,000.

The shelters that were closed owing to the COVID-19 situation are about to be reopened. The Women and Child Development Department is considering expanding the project to other districts.

Earlier, students, employed women, and other women reaching Thiruvananthapuram or Kozhikode cities for some emergency at night had no option but to wait out the night in the waiting room at the railway station or on the platform. Now, they can head to Ente Koodu with a feeling of complete security owing to the police presence there.

Ente Koodu began near the Kasaba police station in Kozhikode in 2016, and in Thiruvananthapuram inside the KSRTC bus-terminal complex. Watchmen, manager, multi-tasking staff and cleaning staff are employed there.

Women, girls, and boys below the age of 12 are put up for free at Ente Koodu.

Original identity proof that is recognised by the government should be produced at the time of admission. Admission time is from 5 p.m. to 7 a.m. If reaching after 9 p.m., the employees have to be convinced about the reason for arrival at that time. Entry is allowed till 3 a.m. depending on capacity. A person can be put up there for a maximum of three days a month. The facility can be used for three consecutive days too. If one needs to stay there for more than three days in an emergency, ₹150 will be charged for each extra day. Free dinner is provided to those who arrive by 8 p.m. Accommodation during the day is not allowed.

Fifty people can be put in the facility that has air-conditioned rooms, kitchen and toilets.

170,2020/10/16,Govt. mandate on using BSNL not enough: unions,"The order on using BSNL’s services does not include its mobile networks

The Central Government's recent order mandating all departments, ministries and public sector units to use telecom services of the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) might not bring much change in the fortunes of the State-run telecom companies, as it does not cover mobile connections.

Some departments and public sector units have contracted private companies for the mobile connections for their official use. For instance, last year, Reliance Jio bagged the contract for the Closed User Group (CUG) mobile connection network for the Indian Railways. The Railway CUG network has 3.78 lakh users, in addition to 7,200 extra connections for bulk SMS purposes.

Though the BSNL Employees' Union (BSNLEU) has welcomed the government's move to mandate the use of BSNL/MTNL in departments and ministries, it has demanded that this should be extended to mobile connections too.

“THE BSNLEU had made this demand more than a decade back. It is heartening that the government has accepted it finally. But, at the same time, exempting mobile connections from this order is certainly to help private players like Reliance Jio. Most of the government ministries and departments already use BSNL landlines. So, the increase in connections from this latest order might not be considerable. But, we stand to gain much from mandating mobile connections from BSNL in these departments, which has not been done,” said C.Santhosh Kumar, State Secretary of the BSNLEU.

Many see the latest move as a ploy on the government’s part to cool the tempers at the continued denial of permission to BSNL to implement its 4G services. Almost all the major trade unions as well as associations of the BSNL were on the protest path after the government cancelled the company’s 4G tender in June. A proposal to upgrade close to 50,000 2G and 3G towers to 4G was also shot down.

The 4G tender was issued in March after much delay. However, a group called Telecom Equipment and Services Export Promotion Council (TEPC) objected to the tender saying that it is not favourable to Indian companies and goes against ‘Make in India’ norms.

The tender was later cancelled in 4G. No fresh tender has been issued till now, as the condition to choose an Indian company remains a hurdle. The employees say that there are hardly any Indian companies capable of meeting the BSNL’s specifications. They also point to the fact that all private companies depend on foreign manufacturers, and none of them had to face any such conditions from the government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-mandate-on-using-bsnl-not-enough-unions/article32873523.ece

As many as 1,010 infected persons recovered from COVID-19 in the district on Thursday when 447 persons tested positive for the virus.

District officials said it was a good sign in general. However, they warned the people not to lower their guard against the disease.

As many as 327 of the new cases were found to have contracted the virus through direct local contact. There were 54 cases without an identifiable source of origin.

30 health workers

Among the cases tested positive on Thursday, there were 30 health workers. It was the biggest number of health workers testing positive on a single day in the district. While 26 of the newly infected came from abroad, 10 came from other States.

The number of active cases currently under treatment in the district dipped to 7,993 on Thursday. However, more than 49,000 people are quarantined across Malappuram.

‘Stay at home’

District Medical Officer K. Sakeena said that it was time that people maintained more vigil and that their cooperation was a must to prevent the spread of the virus. Dr. Sakeena advised people to stay put at their homes.

“Please come out of your homes only if it is necessary,” she said.

172,2020/10/16,Plea to replace special investigation team probing Palathayi child abuse case,"High Court seeks response of State govt.

The Kerala High Court on Thursday asked the State government to respond to a plea submitted by the mother of the survivor in the Palathayi child abuse case seeking to reconstitute the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the case.

The mother of the survivor said that she suspected that there had been high-handed political interference in the investigation process. The petitioner as well as her minor daughter would not get justice if the investigation was conducted by the present team under the leadership of Inspector General of Police S. Sreejith, she said.

The case related to the abuse of the child by her former school teacher, who is a local BJP leader, in Palathayi in Kannur district.

The petitioner said the investigation team was not able to complete the probe despite the lapse of about six months. The delay in completing the investigation was deliberate and aimed at providing undue advantage to the accused and was against the scheme of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act which provides for expeditious investigation and trial. The investigation team did not take any efforts so far to rectify the anomalies and lapses pointed out by the public prosecutor.

The petitioner alleged that the victim had been subjected to mental torture and harassment many times by the counsellors as well as the police. The investigation team did not record the statement of the child by audio-video electronic means as specified under Section 26(4) of the POCSO Act.

The petitioner sought to restrain the SIT from from submitting the final report before the POCSO court in Kasaragod.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/plea-to-replace-special-investigation-team-probing-palathayi-child-abuse-case/article32866402.ece
173,2020/10/16,It has given me the validation I always wanted as an artiste: Swasika Vijay,"The Malayalam actor has won the Kerala State Film Award for the Best Character Actor (Female) for her role in ‘Vasanthi’

Swasika Vijay has not yet come to terms with the fact that she is now a Kerala State Film award winner. She was adjudged the Best Character Actor (Female) at the 50th Kerala State Film Awards announced recently for her titular role in Rahman Brothers’ Vasanthi, which also won the awards for the best film and the best script.

With compliments still pouring in, Swasika is on cloud nine. “Until the winners were announced we had no expectations for the film, let alone an award for me. I was thrown off balance when my name was announced. It seems unreal,” says Swasika.

Vasanthi is the journey of a woman, an orphan who leaves home only to be caught in the ups and downs of life. The narrative is about the men she encounters, her relationships and, finally, her emergence as a survivor. “She becomes strong, emotionally and mentally. The movie is experimental in that the story is told through a creative blend of theatre and cinema,” she adds.

Swasika heard the story in 2016 from actor Siju Wilson, also the producer of the movie. The shoot was completed in 2018 itself. After a preview show early this year, it was ready for a theatre release when the pandemic forced cinemas to shut down.

Getting recognised

Familiar to the Malayali audience as a serial artiste, television anchor, dancer, stage performer and model, Swasika feels that the recognition will help her in the long run. Even though she has been around in the industry for nearly a decade now, character roles have eluded her. Also, it has been a back and forth journey between cinema and television. “The award has given me the validation that I always wanted as an artiste. It ought to clear the doubts about my work,” she says.

A native of Muvattupuzha, Swasika, a dancer, had set her eyes on cinema. “My family has zero connection with the entertainment industry. But they supported me whole-heartedly when they realised that I was serious about acting,” she says. Eventually she had her début, that too in Tamil, in Vaigai (2009). A few Tamil movies later, she started working in Malayalam. Among her early projects were Prabhuvinte Makkal, Cinema Company and Ayalum Njaanum Thammil.

Later, she switched over to television. “While the mini-screen is considered a stepping stone to movies, I took the other way round. I was even advised not to do television because once you are labelled a serial artiste, it would be difficult to get into cinema. They were right to some extent,” she says.

Although she got a good role in Kattappanayile Rithwik Roshan (2016), the movies that followed didn’t help her career. In the meantime she became a favourite of the television audience through serials such as Chinthavishtayaya Seetha and Seetha. “I had almost given up hope of getting meaty roles in cinema. That was when, last year, I became part of two big projects — Porinju Mariyam Jose and Ittimaani Made In China,” she says.

The artiste recalls how she lost a few roles because of her looks. She recounts how a “reputed female actor” commented on a television show about “my acne and long nose” and how she didn’t look like a heroine. “I was in class eleven then and those remarks devastated me. I had my battle with pimples for a long time. However, after a point I stopped bothering about it. Now, at the age of 28, I keep doing my job with the same pimpled face and long nose! In fact, in Vasanthi, I haven’t used make-up in several scenes,” she laughs.

She will soon be shooting for a film with State award-winner Suraj Venjaramoodu, which will be directed by M Padmakumar. She has also been doing short films and is currently anchoring the show Red Carpet on Amrita TV.

Swasika admits that she is inspired by the career trajectory of artistes such as Asha Sharath and Lena, who’ve successfully forayed into cinema from television. “I don’t know if I will get the kind of roles they have done or are still doing. But I am hoping for the best,” she signs off.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9zbegb/article32873196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tvmswasika,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/swasika-on-winning-the-kerala-state-film-award/article32873198.ece
174,2020/10/16,Anjali Barot talks about portraying Jyoti Mehta in ‘Scam 1992’,"The actor, popular for her comical sketches, discusses the challenges of playing a non-fictional character and her work during the lockdown

Anjali Barot always knew she wanted to be an actress. Even when she was studying Bachelor of Mass Media or working as an associate producer for a production house, she wanted to be in front of the camera. That long-nurtured dream came true with the release of Scam 1992- The Harshad Mehta Story, a web-series about Indian stock market scam committed by stockbroker Harshad Mehta. Anjali portrays the role of Jyoti Mehta, Harshad’s wife.

Anjali, who is a familiar face for those who follow sketches by Filtercopy and Scoopwhoop, says that portraying Jyoti was very different compared to all the other roles as for the first time she was portraying a non-fictional character. “While shooting for Scam 1992, I was simultaneously also shooting for the web show Wrong Number where I played the role of a 15-year-old girl; but the role of Jyoti was much more challenging role as it is a period drama and I was portraying a real person. I was conscious about essaying her role and not mimicking her,” she says.

Directed by Hanshal Mehta, the series is adapted from journalist Sucheta Dalal and Debashish Basu's book ‘The Scam: Who Won, Who Lost, Who Got Away’ and is set in the Bombay of 1980s and 1990s. It traces the journey of Harshad, played by Pratik Gandhi, from rags to riches until a journalist exposes him as the man behind one of the biggest financial scams. “Harshad, in the series, is shown as a strong-headed man but Jyoti brings to screen the vulnerable side of him. It is only with her that he lets his emotions takeover. But portraying Jyoti was hard as there is not much information available about her. The director’s perspective was my only guiding light. Though Hansal sir never told me how to act, he would explain to me the reason and emotion behind every dialogue and helped in a great way,” says the Mumbai-based actor.

To adapt herself to the mannerisms of Jyoti, a Gujarati woman in her early 20’s, Anjali worked on her language skills and worked on her Hindi and Gujarati speaking skills. “The costume designers taught me how to carry my outfits like a woman of Gujarati origin,” she adds. Anjali who has starred in several advertisements, confesses that she never saw her shots on the monitor while shooting for Scam 1992 as she would get conscious about herself. “I watched the whole series only after it was released online,” she laughs. Of all the scenes from the series, Anjali loves the last one where Jyoti discovers the body of Harshad. “I was nervous about it because the shot demanded me to break down and I had never done it before. I was worried that it would not look natural. On the day of the shoot, Hansal sir said that he would not tell me where the body was and I had to actual run around the set looking for it. This worked well and the shot came out natural,” she adds.

Talking about her time post wrapping of Scam 1992’s shoot, Anjali says that it was the pandemic-induced lockdown time which turned out to be a productive phase for her. She shot sketches for various production houses and also worked on a short film called O Maa. “I took up only those projects that allowed me to shoot by myself at home. I was not okay with people coming into my house as it would be dangerous for them and for me. It was a fun experience as these projects also taught me a lot about camera angles and light for shooting,” says Anjali.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/aycpu0/article32872820.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/anjali-barot-talks-about-portraying-jyoti-mehta-in-scam-1992/article32872822.ece
175,2020/10/16,New voices for Creators’ Summit,"Short films of five Annapurna College of Film and Media alumni were chosen for digital streaming as part of Creators’ Summit initiative

Five alumni of Annapurna College of Film and Media were in for a pleasant surprise when they learnt that their short films, made as part of their graduate programme, will be streamed on OTT platform Aha for public viewing.

The move comes in the wake of Aha’s collaboration with Annapurna College of Film and Media for its Creators’ Summit initiative. The Creators’ Summit is a year-long initiative through which the digital platform plans to identify promising new voices in the creative community from across the country, eventually paving way for collaborations.

To kick start this initiative, five short films began streaming on October 16. Here’s an introduction to the filmmakers and their short films:

Mahesh Gaddam

Director, Atma Rama Ananda Ramana

The 2018 undergrad alumni of Annapurna shot this film in January-February 2018, focusing on the dilemma of going abroad for better career prospects as opposed to staying back in India in the company of loved ones. “The idea triggered when I learnt that our late President APJ Abdul Kalam preferred to work with DRDO and ISRO and turned down an offer from NASA. In my film, one character is torn between going abroad and staying back. He has a newborn baby and elderly parents and won’t be able to spend time with them if he goes abroad,” says Mahesh. The budding filmmaker brought in aspects from mythology to give depth to the story, drawing parallels to conversations between Krishna and Arjuna in Mahabharata.

Uthkarsha Dahatr Balaram

Director, Nene Devudu

An alumna of the 2019 masters’ batch, Uthkarsha took a leaf out of her childhood memory for her graduation short film. The Bengaluru resident remembered being privy to a ‘Bootha kola’ or spirit worship ritual practiced in coastal Karnataka. She used that ritual as a tool to address relationship issues. “We filmed in areas around Hyderabad like Chilkur, and Bapatla in Andhra Pradesh to get that coastal atmosphere. My film was in Kannada, titled Naan Devullu (I am God) and when Aha chose this film for streaming, our college generously took up the responsibility of dubbing it in Telugu,” she says.

Currently working as an assistant director for a Kannada film, Uthkarsha has used the lockdown to write new content for series and feature films.

Purvangi Ranjan

Director, Mounam

Allahabad-bred and now Chennai-based Purvangi looks back with pride at her graduation film Chuppi (Hindi), which addresses the need for sexual education for children, albeit in a lighter vein. “Rather than a heavy, preachy film on the subject, I thought why not make a family-friendly humorous film that can be a conversation starter,” she says. The 2019 graduation batch alumni made Chuppi as a crowdfunded film and the idea was to not make it depressing or dark. “We have been missing conversations about sex education in our homes for generations. I believe that one has to talk to children openly, sensitively about sex,” she says.

Chuppi was dubbed in Telugu as Mounam by Annapurna college fraternity for digital streaming: “When I worked on the film, a lot of people said I should have picked up another idea. But it’s heartening that my film was chosen for streaming,” says Purvangi.

Venkat Sai Santosh

Director, Varnamala

The 2016 alumnus’ film Varnamala is a period drama in the early 1900s, in the backdrop of the zamindari system and deep-rooted class biases. He had shot this film in 2014 in the vicinity of Ramoji Film City and Kompally in Hyderabad, where he found a few locations that were bereft of urbanisation. “The story explores the tussle between a cruel village head who upholds untouchability, and his benevolent son who wants to change the age-old practices,” explains Venkat. The aspiring filmmaker is now assisting director Krish on his new Telugu period drama.

Vaishvi Mistry

Director, Maraka Aithe Emiti

Now based in Surat, Vaishvi recalls how she approached several schools in Hyderabad, seeking permission to shoot her short film in their premises. Many were reluctant, one yielded. She needed to shoot at two schools and finally knocked on the doors of her alma mater in Surat. The subject: The contrasting stories of how two families approach the menstrual travails of their adolescent daughters. Originally titled Sort the Spot, the film was dubbed in Telugu for digital streaming. “The parents and the young girls were extremely cooperative and without their help, I couldn’t have made this film. Many girls face these situations in school while growing up, unknowingly staining their clothes. How their peers and parents react to such a situation makes a huge impression on the girls,” explains Vaishvi. When many schools in Hyderabad were reluctant to allow filming this story in their premises, Vaishvi was all the more determined to put the story out.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/chy6t0/article32872708.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Annapurna,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/aha-picks-up-short-films-of-five-alumni-of-annapurna-college-of-film-and-media-for-digital-streaming/article32872709.ece

177,2020/10/16,Every character is a responsibility: Kumud Mishra,"The actor, who plays his first lead role as a circus artist in the recent film ‘Ram Singh Charlie’, talks about his transition from theatre to cinema

Famous in theatre circles for over 25 years for his many memorable performances (Shakkar ke Paanch Daane, Kaumudi, Muktidham etc.), Kumud Mishra is now making his mark in movies. His latest film, Ram Singh Charlie, directed by Nitin Kakkar and released recently on SonyLiv, features his first role as lead. His performance as the eponymous character elevates the well-written story about the struggles of a circus artist. He has acted in other films too, including Rockstar (2011), Filmistaan (2014), Airlift (2016), Sultan (2016), M.S. Dhoni — The Untold Story (2016), Mulk (2018), Article 15 (2019), Thappad (2020) etc. Excerpts from an interview:

We’ve been hearing about ‘Ram Singh Charlie’ for a long time. When was it made?

We finished filming in 2015 and post-production work was completed in 2016. It took four-five years of struggle to release it — it’s the same story with every independent film. But now, we’re are happy with the response we’ve been getting after its OTT release. It reaffirms our faith in the film. I think it has come at the right time.

Why is this the right time?

Because the struggle of Ram Singh in the film is something many of us are going through. Workers have lost jobs; cinema theatres are closed. So many people are suffering without work. Film stars might survive on their savings, but what about technicians, spot boys etc? In other sectors too, people have lost jobs. All of them can relate to Ram Singh’s struggle when the circus shuts down.

When did you come to Mumbai?

In 1995. I came at the behest of my guru, Satyadev Dubey, who had set me up for a screen test for a new film (The Making of the Mahatma; Shyam Benegal). The plan was to complete the audition and go back in 3-4 days. But when I reached PMGP colony, I decided that this was where I wanted to live. I had no ambitions to work in cinema or television. My interest was theatre, and since Dubeyji was in Mumbai, I started working with him. I then met Sunil Shanbag and worked with his theatre group, Arpana, in many plays. At the same time, I also got television work in Mahesh Bhat’s Swabhimaan and Tanuja Chandra’s Zameen Aasmaan.

In theatre, you have played the main protagonist’s role more often than not. But in films, at least until now, you’ve been doing small roles. As an actor, how do you negotiate this difference?

I am fundamentally an actor. I don’t care how long or how important the character is . My focus has always been what I am learning and with whom I am working. In both theatre and cinema, the team is very important. More so in theatre, because you are spending so much time together. For example, with some directors like Abhishek Majumdar, you are together for 8-10 hours every day during rehearsals. In Mumbai plays, we work a minimum of 3-4 hours in rehearsals every day. If there have been moments where I have felt that I have been given a smaller role, I have consciously fought my ego and reminded myself that I am an actor and my duty is to be able to perform any role. As far as television and cinema are concerned, you are a product there. So, your fees and sometimes the length of your role are dependent on your market value, and there is no question of nurturing my ego there. Yes, at times I feel that I should be getting much better work. But the most important thing for me is that I do justice to the roles I get.

What was your first film?

Sardari Begum (1996). It was a dream come true — I was in a frame directed by Shyam Benegal.

You took a long break from movies after ‘Sardari Begum’. When and how did you come back to films?

Amrit Sagar was making 1971 in 2007. It was written by Piyush Mishra, and a lot of theatre friends like Manav Kaul, Deepak Dobriyal, Chittranjan Giri, Ravikishan and Manoj Bajpayee were part of the project. I couldn’t say no. But even though it won a national award, it didn’t do well in cinemas. Then Rockstar came to me via the casting director, Mukesh Chhabra. This film made me popular among the general public, and so began the second phase of my journey in films.

Do you think OTT platforms have led to an increase in content-oriented works and more talented actors getting work?

I think it is what society today demands — people clearly want something new and real. And we have a new generation of directors and writers who are interested in telling different stories. Also, due to the lockdown, the significance of OTT platforms has increased tremendously, and now many younger, talented folks who were waiting in the wings are getting opportunities. And because people have so many options on these platforms, any work that’s not good vanishes quickly into a black hole. The chalta hai attitude will no longer work.

As far as big films are concerned, for that matter any film, the cinema theatre is the place for them. The collective experience of watching a film in a theatre is vital for the art. And big budget films are essential for keeping movie economics healthy. They invest big money and earn big money, which feeds many mouths.

How different is acting in theatre and acting in a film? How do you negotiate the different demands of the mediums?

The new film directors have been a blessing. They don’t treat actors differently. For instance, Anubhav Sinha has always given me the full script. Same with Imtiaz Ali. For Rockstar, I worked for one-and-a-half months on the script and the language. I never felt I was treated differently compared to a star like Ranbir Kapoor. Of course, the mediums are different. In theatre, you rehearse so much that your role becomes a physical memory. In cinema, when I am in front of the camera, I am only worried about the other character. I don’t have to perform for the camera. But in theatre I have to be aware of the space and the audience as well as the co-actor, and I project my performance accordingly. For instance, the way I would perform at Prithvi and the way I would at Rangashankara are different, and it also depends on the audience energy since it is live.

Ram Singh is your first lead role. How did the film happen?

After Filmistaan, when we met at a party, Nitin Kakkar had told me about his plan to make this film. He asked me if I wanted to do it. After I heard the script narration, there was no way I could have rejected such a role. At this juncture in my career, I consider myself lucky to be offered an opportunity to play such a character.

It is a challenging role; you essay all kinds of emotions as well as impersonate Charlie Chaplin. Did you prepare differently this time, knowing the film’s responsibility rested on your shoulders?

Playing the lead role does not necessarily increase your responsibility. Every character is a responsibility. When Nitin cast me in Ram Singh Charlie, I was overweight, and he wanted me to play a Charlie Chaplin impersonator. I had to work very hard. I used to go to the office in the morning and work till evening. There were classes lined up — dance classes, Chaplin training and script reading sessions all day. It was an exciting process. So, yes, it was difficult.

You have recently started using social media. It seems there is more scrutiny than ever of celebrities on social media; they have to be on guard all the time.

I am not at all comfortable with social media. I signed up to promote the new film. Social media has big reach and has its own place, but it is not society. It’s unfortunate that it has started dictating the conversations in our lives. It’s a tragedy that newspapers have gone out of our lives. As an actor, an artist and a person I have an opinion on politics, economics and society and I don’t hesitate to express myself. But I don’t want to use social media to express myself. I will directly converse with my society instead.

How do you see your journey so far?

I live in the present. Thankfully, my memory is bad, so I don’t dwell on the past at all. I don’t see Ram Singh Charlie or any other work in the context of a 25-year journey. But I have really enjoyed the journey. I still feel as nervous when I have a new role as I did 25 years ago. Yes, I understand the craft better now, but that’s a double-edged sword because you tend to resort to your bag of tricks. I am happy with where I am. Both my personal and artistic journeys have been very satisfying.

180,2020/10/16,‘You’ Season 3 adds Shalita Grant and Travis Van Winkle,"Both Penn Badgley and Victoria Pedretti will be reprising their characters in the third season of the Netflix stalker-themed series

Actors Travis Van Winkle and Shalita Grant have boarded the cast of Netflix’s You season three.

Winkle, best known for starring in TNT’s The Last Ship, and NCIS: New Orleans alumna Grant will feature as series regulars in the psychological thriller show, developed by Greg Berlanti and Sera Gamble.

Based on the book series by Caroline Kepnes, You features Penn Badgley as Joe Goldberg, a serial killer, stalker and bookstore manager. Its first season premiere on the streamer’s platform in 2018. The show’s second season, which also featured Haunting of the Hill House breakout Victoria Pedretti, debuted in December 2019. Both Badgley and Pedretti will be reprising their characters in the third season.

According to Deadline, Van Winkle will play Cary, a wealthy, charismatic, and self-proclaimed Master of Self-Optimisation who runs his own supplement company and invites Joe into his inner circle.

The original ‘mean girl’, she’s threatened by Love (Pedretti) and only pretends to welcome her into her wealthy and elitist social circle. But underneath her insecurity, there’s a pragmatic, loyal person who could turn out to be a true friend.

Gamble and Berlanti are also returning as executive producers, with Gamble serving as showrunner.

181,2020/10/16,"Claims on reservation being affected with IoE status for Anna University are baseless, says L. Murugan","“Reservation is a Constitutional right. It is everywhere. How can it be removed if you give an IoE status?” the BJP leader asked

Conferring the Institute of Eminence (IoE) tag on Anna University will not affect the reservation policy in place in the State, BJP Tamil Nadu president L. Murugan said on Friday, while accusing some people of making baseless allegations on the issue.

“Reservation is a Constitutional right. It is everywhere. How can it be removed if you give an IoE status? The claim made by some people that reservation will be affected due to the IoE status for Anna University is an absolute lie,” Mr. Murugan told reporters in Chennai.

Mr. Murugan said the Anna University Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa was trying to function independently and that some people were trying to stop him from carrying out his duties. “Anna University is a world-class university. The V-C is taking efforts to take the institution forward and to higher standards. What is the need to remove him,” Mr. Murugan asked.

To a question on whether Mr. Surappa had taken steps beyond his powers by writing to the Centre directly, Mr. Murugan said that the statutes of the University needed to be looked at to see what powers were vested with the V-C and what were not. “We don’t know whether there is a rule stating that he cannot write [to the Centre] without the Tamil Nadu government’s permission. We have to look at what the rules say,” he said.

On the controversy over actor Vijay Sethupathi starring in Sri Lankan cricketer Muthiah Muralitharan’s biopic ‘800’ and opposition from some quarters over it, the BJP leader said everyone had freedom of expression and it was their right to make a movie. “Making a movie is someone’s right and someone acting in it is their individual right. Why should one say whether someone should make a movie, or whether someone should not act in it,” he asked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/claims-on-reservation-being-affected-with-ioe-status-for-anna-university-are-baseless-says-l-murugan/article32873152.ece
182,2020/10/16,"For these doll-makers, COVID-19 has taken away their business, but not their hope","Children of a doll-making family in Vellore are helping their parents, as due to an inability to pay fees, they have not been able to take their college exams

S. Mukesh, a fourth-year-engineering student and his youngster sister S Vibeshini, a second-year medical imaging technology student, who hail from a mud doll-making family, deftly paint the contours of a mud doll at their house in Sallavanpet, Vellore. However, the usual joy is missing from their faces. Since COVID-19 has impacted their family business, they have not been able to pay fees, and were not able to take their semester exams this year.

“I was not able to appear for the semester exams in August as I could not pay the fees. The college management asked me to take a loan and pay the fees, but my father T. Senthil Kumar has also already borrowed to purchase raw materials to make the dolls,” said Ms. Vibeshini.

Ms. Vibeshini and her brother now work with their father as most of their staff have left in search of other jobs. “We have been in this trade for the past five generations. We used to have 20 staff members to make dolls and paint them. Every year we make around 10,000 dolls, ranging from three inches tall to 3 feet, and sell them during Navaratri, Krishna Jayanthi and Vinayaka Chathurthi. But this year, our business has plummeted and I am not sure how we will even eat next year,” said Mr. Senthil Kumar who runs the doll-making company.

Breaking into tears he said that though he is happy to see his children take part in their traditional work, he is very upset at their missing their examinations due to his inability to pay fees. “I have no other go as my staff members have left as I was not able to pay their wages. So my children are helping me now to complete the dolls. But I want them to study well and do well in life,” said Mr. Senthil Kumar.

Ms. Vibeshini however is hopeful. “I used to make dolls and paint them when I was a child. So I am happy to help my father. I know things will turn around soon,” she says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/m0mx41/article32873040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16OCTTH--Dollamakerjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/for-these-doll-makers-covid-19-has-taken-away-their-business-but-not-their-hope/article32873041.ece
183,2020/10/16,TN tells Court prospectus will not be issued for medical admissions till a decision is taken on reservation bill,"During the course of the hearing, Justice N. Kirubakaran broke down in tears and observed that a decision has to be taken at the earliest to safeguard the interest of government school students

The State government on Friday informed the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court that until a decision is taken by the Governor on the assent to the Bill on implementing 7.5 % horizontal reservation for government school students who have cleared the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) in medical admissions, the prospectus for admissions will not be issued.

Advocate General Vijay Narayan informed a Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi that no decision was taken by the Governor on the assent, and till then the prospectus/admission notice will not be issued for medical admissions.

During the course of the hearing, Justice N. Kirubakaran broke down in tears and observed that a decision has to be taken at the earliest to safeguard the interest of government school students.

The judges pointed out that as per data available, in the last three years only three, five and six students from government schools got admission in medical colleges. Therefore, a decision had to be taken with respect to the implementation of the Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Courses in Medicine, Dentistry, Indian Medicine and Homeopathy on Preferential Basis to Students of Government Schools Bill, 2020, the judges said.

Earlier, the court had observed that the Bill was passed by the Legislative Assembly unanimously on September 15 and sent to the Governor for his assent on the very same day. However, it had been pending for one month without any decision being taken on it.

If no decision was taken with regard to reservation for government school students, definitely, fewer students would get admission and the interests of the government school students would be affected, the judges said.

The court was hearing a batch of public interest litigation petitions which sought a direction to the State to implement horizontal reservation for government school students as recommended by the commission headed by retired High Court Judge P. Kalaiyarasan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rk76xh/article32872654.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16OCTTH--MADURAIBENCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-tells-court-prospectus-will-not-be-issued-for-medical-admissions-till-a-decision-is-taken-on-reservation-bill/article32872655.ece
184,2020/10/16,﻿Child rights activists want underlying problems in government homes to be addressed,"Activists say that a child-friendly approach, segregation of first-time offenders from others and psychological counselling is required at the homes

In the wake of inmates of a Government Observation Home in Madurai vandalising the home child rights experts say there is an urgent need to address the larger, underlying problems behind such incidents. Meanwhile, staff of different observation homes want support from parents and the society to bring about a change in the children.

A few days ago, a group of 18 inmates of a government observation home in Kamaraj Salai, Teppakulam, vandalised property including a television, computer and benches when they staged a violent protest reportedly demanding bail. After inspection by a Judicial Magistrate, the inmates were transferred to Vellore, Trichy and Tirunelveli observation homes .

The incident reveals a deeper problem in the system, experts say. As per the Juvenile Justice Act, all children are entitled to bail immediately. “When the children are denied bail for a long time and kept at the home, they get frustrated. Either the social work members of the Juvenile Justice Board or the staff of the home should sit down and explain to them why their bail is being denied and when the next hearing would be. Besides shifting them to other homes, especially during a pandemic, without addressing the root problems, will not serve any purpose,” said a child rights practitioner.

Girija Kumara Babu, a child rights activist, said that usually bail is denied in the interest of the child. One reason is considering their safety, the other is to prevent them falling into the hands of adult gang members who are still at large and another is to ensure that children do not go back to the same environment which had a negative influence on them.

“Otherwise they cannot be denied bail, especially during COVID-19 pandemic. And whenever bail is denied, the reason should be explained to the child and every stage of the case should be informed to him/her -- this is what it means to be child friendly. Besides, there is a need to segregate children in conflict with law based on the offence. If first-time offenders and those involved in heinous crimes are kept together, it will lead to problems,” she said.

Another child rights activist said that the staff of the observation home should keep a close watch on the behaviour of the inmates and simmering dissatisfaction should be identified at an early stage so that some corrective measures can be taken to address their grievances. “Nobody likes to be under detention -- if their relationship with the home staff is not conducive, it will lead to rebellions,” the activist added.

Geetha Ramaseshan, a senior advocate who has worked extensively in the realm of child rights said that more steps should be taken to channelise the energy of the inmates. “They will be frustrated and they should be kept engaged. Besides, it is important to segregate the children,” she reiterated.

Jim Jesudoss, child rights practitioner, said that most of the inmates are adolescents and they need psychological attention. “They will have an underlying sense of rejection, but will not express it. A therapeutic approach should be taken to address this and this can be done by spending quality time with each inmate,” he added.

Staff from several observation homes said that they need the support of parents and the society to being about a change in the children. “We mould them during their stay in the observation home and send them back to their homes. Due to negligence and lack of monitoring by parents, they fall back into their old habits. Besides, society also stigmatises them. If this is not corrected, the attitude of the children cannot be changed,” said a staff member.

Sources from the Social Defence Department said that they are working on a contingency plan. “There are psychologists at the home, and the children are segregated. We also teach them different skills. This incident was due to bail-related issues and each child has to be studied separately. Sometimes bail is delayed for the safety of the child,” said an official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/child-rights-activists-want-underlying-problems-in-government-homes-to-be-addressed/article32872442.ece

An elderly man, who was recently kept in a freezer box while he was still alive, by his relatives, died during the early hours of Friday.

The man Balasubramania Kumar (74), who was rescued and admitted to the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital, died without responding to treatment. According to doctors, the patient was suffering from chronic lung ailments.

On Tuesday, Kumar’s kin, allegedly presuming him to be dead, kept him in a freezer box for over 12 hours. The patient was later rescued when staff of the freezer company visited to collect the box. Police and 108 ambulance service staff had shifted Kumar to the Salem GH.

According to health authorities, an inquiry has been launched against a private hospital where the patient was last taken for treatment and which issued the death certificate. Officials said, the patient was referred to be taken to home by doctors, considering his health condition.

186,2020/10/16,Stalin welcomes Higher Education Minister’s statement on Anna University,"The DMK president said the Tamil Nadu government must communicate its decision on the university’s IoE status to the Centre immediately

DMK president M.K. Stalin welcomed Higher Education Minister K.P. Anbalagan’s statement that Anna University did not require the Institute of Eminence (IoE) status, if it meant loss of reservation and denying admission to students.

“Even though it is a delayed announcement, it is welcome. However, the State government should immediately communicate it’s decision to the Centre in writing in a transparent manner,” Mr. Stalin said in a Facebook post.

Mr. Stalin also urged Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami to recommend the dismissal M.K. Surappa as Vice Chancellor of Anna University for functioning unilaterally.

A separate statement issued by DMK’s general secretary Duraimurgan said that Mr. Stalin would hold a meeting with the party district representatives, zone-wise at Anna Arivalayam from October 21 to October 28.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/lyec5t/article29450616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-stalin,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stalin-welcomes-higher-education-ministers-statement-on-anna-university/article32870676.ece
187,2020/10/16,"Institute of Eminence status to Anna University would mean loss of reservation, Higher Education Minister says","Speaking in the wake of the controversy and the State government’s notice to the Vice Chancellor seeking his response, K. P. Anbalagan said Anna University did not require an IoE status if it meant loss of reservation and denying admission to poor students

﻿

The Institute of Eminence (IoE) status to Anna University would mean the loss of 69% reservation that was a result of a hard-won struggle for social justice, a hike in fees, the declaration of entrance exams and disproportionate admission of students from other States in place of students from poor backgrounds within the State, said Minister for Higher Education K.P. Anbalagan on Friday.

The Minister was commenting on the row triggered by the Anna University Vice Chancellor M.K Surappa’s letter to the Centre on the University’s financial readiness for IoE status.

Speaking in the wake of the controversy and the State government’s notice to the Vice Chancellor seeking his response, Mr. Anbalagan said, Anna University did not require an IoE status if it meant loss of reservation and made the University exclusive in denying the entry of poor students. “69% reservations will become a question mark, there will entrance exams, then a hike in fees. Amma’s government does not need all that. The Vice Chancellor’s tenure is fixed, but the government has a mandate to protect institutions for posterity,” Mr. Anbalagan said.

“The Vice Chancellor’s letter, though unilateral, pertained solely to the financial state of the University and its ability to mobilise finances for the IoE status. But the question then is, where will these funds come from? Will they take it from the affiliate colleges and regional centres?” he asked.

The IoE status considers only the 4 research institutes of the University and does not factor in the 13 affiliate colleges and 4 regional centers, all of which will suffer. “If research is the key, the State government is ready to provide all the funds required,” he said.

According to Mr. Anbalagan, the research institutions were doing very well, while there has been a fall in admissions in the other colleges. The focus then should be to involve all the affiliate colleges, and not to allow one set of institutions to thrive at the expense of others, he said.

The State has been relatively ahead in higher education learning, close to reaching the target of the new Education Policy’s vision for 2035. The NEP envisions the higher education percentage at 54%, while our State had reached 49% last year itself, the Minister said.

The government will provide all the research funds required by the University and there is absolutely no need for IoE status for Anna University, which is already among top-ranked institutions, Mr. Anbalagan said. He underlined that the University was under the control of the government, and the government will simply reject the proposal for IoE and hence there was no need for any drastic measure of demanding the resignation of the V-C.

Touching upon the late admissions to colleges, the Minister said, admissions to arts and science colleges have been extended upto October 31, to enable those who had cleared supplementary exams in the Plus Two board exams to also apply to colleges, wherever there are still vacant seats.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/l1gvg9/article32869932.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16OCTTH--ANBALAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/institute-of-eminence-status-to-anna-university-would-mean-loss-of-reservation-higher-education-minister-says/article32869933.ece

189,2020/10/16,MNM moves HC for conduct of Grama Sabha meetings,"Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM), led by actor Kamal Haasan, has filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the State government to order conduct of Grama Sabha meetings in all village panchayats across the State as per the Tamil Nadu Grama Sabha (Quorum and Procedure for Convening and Conducting of Meetings) Rules of 1998.

The party, represented by its general secretary- organisation (North and East) A.G. Mourya, stated that it had sent a representation to the Rural Development Secretary as well as Director on October 7 for conducting Grama Sabha meetings. However, it was not considered by the officials concerned and hence it had no other option but to approach the court.

In its affidavit, the party pointed out that the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act of 1994 highlights significant role to be played by Grama Sabha, a body consisting of local residents, in the decision-making process of panchayats. The law requires Grama Sabha to meet at least twice a year and makes it mandatory for its suggestions to be given due consideration by panchayats.

“People use the forum to discuss local governance and development and make need-based plans for the village. Panchayats implement development programmes under the overarching mandate, supervision and monitoring of the Grama Sabha. It is submitted that all decisions of the Panchayat are taken through the Grama Sabha,” the party said.

Since such was the importance of those bodies, the Director of Rural Development had ordered for meeting of Grama Sabha across the State on October 2. Due to the pandemic COVID-19, the Director had also issued elaborate guidelines on September 26 listing out the procedures to be followed while convening those meetings.

However, without any rhyme or reason, the individual District Collectors called off the Grama Sabha meetings on October 1, the petitioner party said and claimed that such cancellation was against the 1994 Act as well as 1998 Rules.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/mnm-moves-hc-for-conduct-of-grama-sabha-meetings/article32866753.ece
190,2020/10/16,Marriage hall owners move HC against govt. order on refunds,"State had directed them to cancel bookings made after March 24 and refund advance payments

The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to file its counter affidavit to a writ petition preferred by the Tamil Nadu Kalyana Mandapam Owners’ Association, challenging a government order (G.O.) issued on March 23, directing all marriage halls in the State to cancel bookings made beyond March 24 and refund advance payments.

Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana directed Special Government Pleader V. Shanmugasundaram to ensure that the counter is filed by November 11, since the petitioner association had also sought for a direction restraining the police from initiating criminal action for non-refund of money on the ground that the refund of advance payments was a civil matter.

In his oral submissions before the court, the SGP said the writ petition was not maintainable since the association could not seek a general remedy on behalf of its members. He said individual marriage hall owners must approach the court if they had any grievance with regard to the G.O. on refunding the advance amount.

In an affidavit filed on behalf of the association, its president N. Singaimuthu said it was standard practice among marriage hall owners not to refund the advance amount if the bookings are cancelled at the instance of those who have booked the halls. He said any dispute related to refund of such advance money was civil in nature.

Cancellations continue

Stating that the State government had relaxed lockdown restrictions, step by step, and permitted marriages to be conducted with a limited number of guests, the association said that despite such permission, many chose to cancel their bookings, though hall owners were willing to let out the premises, while also ensuring adherence to safety norms to combat COVID-19.

After having cancelled the bookings, some of them lodged complaints against marriage hall owners, with the Collectors, and many even approached the police. He said members of the association were put to great hardship due to such complaints.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/marriage-hall-owners-move-hc-against-govt-order-on-refunds/article32866744.ece
191,2020/10/16,Online charge on tickets cannot be subjected to entertainment tax: HC,"‘Theatres collect it for providing additional services’

The online booking charge of ₹30, collected by theatres over and above the cost of each ticket, cannot be subjected to entertainment tax by the Commercial Taxes Department, under the Tamil Nadu Entertainment Tax Act of 1939, the Madras High Court (HC) ruled on Thursday.

Justices Vineet Kothari and M.S. Ramesh held that online booking charges, collected by cinema halls, were for the additional service provided to customers, and they were not mandatory for gaining entry into theatres. Therefore, such a charge could not be subjected to entertainment tax, they said.

Writ appeals

The ruling was passed while allowing a batch of writ appeals preferred by PVR Limited, formerly known as SPI Cinemas Private Limited, of New Delhi. The Bench quashed the entertainment tax reassessment orders, with respect to the appellant, from the assessment years 2007-08 to 2014-15.

The judges agreed with senior counsel R.V. Easwar, representing the appellants, that only payments required to be made mandatorily, as a condition for attending an entertainment event, could be subjected to entertainment tax, and not the additional payments collected for other services.

The senior counsel said that the online booking charge of ₹30 per ticket was collected from customers for providing them the premium facility of booking tickets on their mobile phones and computers, without having to visit cinema halls and stand in queues to purchase tickets.

‘Colonial legislation’

Such a charge could not be subjected to entertainment tax, he argued, and the judges concurred with him. Though Mohammed Shafiq, Special Government Pleader (Taxes), contended that all payments connected to entertainment could be subjected to tax under the 1939 Act, the Bench did not agree with him.

Authoring the verdict, Justice Kothari also pointed out that the Tamil Nadu Entertainment Tax Act of 1939 was a colonial legislation, enacted at a time in history when nobody had even conceived the idea of Internet, a web portal or the concept of booking cinema tickets online or through apps.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/krmouv/article32857506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THHC2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/online-charge-on-tickets-cannot-be-subjected-to-entertainment-tax-hc/article32866740.ece

The Industrial Tribunal, Tamil Nadu, has closed the dispute between pharma giant Pfizer Healthcare India Pvt. Ltd. and a section of its workers, after the parties reached a settlement agreement. The dispute relates to closure of the company’s plant at Irungattukottai and job loss of 270 workers.

In early 2019, Pfizer decided to shut down two of its Indian manufacturing plants — Irungattukottai (Chennai) and Aurangabad (Maharashtra) — due to issues of viability. The manufacturing plants had come under Pfizer’s fold after it acquired Ospira, a provider of injectable drugs and infusion technologies in 2015.

The Podhu Thozhilalar Sangam had raised a dispute before the Deputy Commissioner of Labour, Sriperumbudur, with regard to cessation of employment of 270 workmen. Talks failed and the dispute was referred to the Industrial Tribunal, Tamil Nadu, according to court documents.

After the submission of the report, both parties said they had entered into a settlement and the claims of the members of the petitioner union had been settled, the Industrial Tribunal said.

As per the settlement reached on February 6, Pfizer paid members of the union about ₹4.67 crore.

193,2020/10/16,Chennai police reintroduce foot patrolling for more visibility,"The measure is aimed at enhancing the sense of safety among citizens

The Chennai city police have reintroduced foot patrolling in many areas to increase visible policing. The old system was discontinued after the advent of motorised vehicles and CCTV cameras. The restoration of foot patrolling is expected to increase police visibility in busy areas, enhance the sense of safety among citizens and build bridges between citizens and the police.

M.S. Baskar, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Public Relations, said, “On instructions of City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, this new system of patrolling has been introduced in all police districts. All officers in their jurisdictions are doing foot patrol in the interior areas.”

Police officers got down from their vehicles and went around the streets of T. Nagar, Madhavaram, Washermanpet and other police districts. Uniformed personnel went door to door and listened to the grievances of the public relating to law and order issues, such as selling of ganja and narcotic drugs, illegal sale of liquor, movement of suspicious persons or disturbance caused by anti-social elements.

K. Balakrishnan, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Madhavaram, said, “Instead of moving on vehicles on the arterial roads, our officers have been told to visit the interior areas by foot so as to familiarise themselves with the residents...”

On Wednesday night, M. Mahimaiveeran, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Valasaravakkam, led the patrolling in VOC Street, Tirumalai Nagar and Ramapuram. Mr. Mahimaiveeran said, “Our aim was to create a good interface with the public. The phone numbers of officers and men were shared with the public to get the inputs on illegal activities.”

However, residents feel the existing patrolling system needs improvement, and there are complaints of policemen not visiting their areas. V. Rajagopal, president of the Anna Nagar Western Extension Residents Welfare Association, said, “Jeep patrolling is frequently done but patrolling by two-wheelers is rarely done in our areas.” K.L. Balasubramanian of R.K. Nagar Residents Welfare Association, Mandaveli, said, “The new system of foot patrolling may bring results in crime prevention... The police should better the existing system and popularise mobile applications and social media accounts so that the public can reach them easily at the time of crisis since most residents have smart phones.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gt0s7j/article32866730.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THPOLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/chennai-police-reintroduce-foot-patrolling-for-more-visibility/article32866731.ece
194,2020/10/16,"From tech tools to holistic development, teacher training goes online","The focus is on lesson planning, classroom communication and student assessment

The last few months have brought about unprecedented changes in school education, and teachers too have had to adapt themselves to ensure that students have taken to a new system — one that has moved completely online.

Several schools have had teacher training programmes through the year; these too have been taken online with a focus on holistic development.

“We’ve had a lot of teachers sign up for a week-long certification course in online teaching as well as schools that have shown interest in signing up their teachers for the same. The focus is on lesson planning, classroom communication, student assessment and remediation in an online environment,” said Anjali Jain, founder and director, Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA).

At weekly free webinars that CENTA conducts for teachers, a range of topics are discussed. “There are several ICT tools that lend themselves well to online teaching and assessments which more teachers should be aware of. Managing a classroom of children virtually comes with its own challenges and we need user-friendly teaching aids that make our classes engaging,” said Indra Priyadarshini, who conducted a webinar on how to effectively use Google Forms and Padlet for student evaluation.

LEAD School, an ED Tech company, launched a free teacher development programme and certification under its Teacher’s Academy last month. It focuses on not just teaching skills required for an online environment but also on the need to provide emotional and social support. CEO and co-founder Sumeet Mehta said the company focuses on building resources and community for teachers across India, and the programme is aimed at improving teaching abilities and learning outcomes.

Several schools that engage experts during a regular academic year to address the teachers on areas like classroom communication have held these interactions online in the form of webinars.

From June, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has been sending regular circulars to its affiliated schools asking teachers and principals to take up courses on the DIKSHA platform on a range of topics.

“We have been encouraging our teachers to take up these courses available on the platform, and there are several options which include subject-wise courses as well as topics that focus on holistic development. The courses are extremely useful for the teachers,” said Ashok Shankar, general secretary, CBSE Schools Management Association.

Teachers are also stressing the need to mandate training programmes, with a clear focus on mental health. “This is especially a must before schools reopen. Teachers should be equipped to speak to students and reassure them about the situation since there has been no direct interaction with them for over seven months now,” said P.K.

The Tamil Nadu government ran 265 Shramik special trains, at a cost of ₹34.6 crore, to help 3.54 lakh migrant workers reach their homes in various States during the pandemic.

A reply given by the Southern Railway, under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, to RTI activist R. Pandiaraja, revealed that the Centre did not make any contribution towards the fare.

The special trains were run with sleeper class coaches, wherein only passengers identified by State governments were allowed to board. Unreserved tickets were distributed to migrant workers by the State governments.

Highest number

The Tamil Nadu government operated 265 Shramik Specials, the highest number of special trains run by any southern State, including the Union Territory of Puducherry, under the Southern Railway.

This is more than 50% of the 507 Shramik Specials run by the Southern Railway to take home about 7.35 lakh migrant workers between May and August.

“Tamil Nadu paid for the fare of all passengers on the 264 trains. For the passengers of one train, the Uttarakhand government paid the fare. That was probably a train operated on the request of the Uttarakhand government to take back tourists/pilgrims from their State, stranded in Tamil Nadu,” said Mr. Pandiaraja.

Of the total ₹66.28 crore collected by the Southern Railway, through ticket fare for all Shramik Specials, Tamil Nadu alone paid ₹34.6 crore.

The trains were operated from 26 railway stations across the State.

The highest number of special trains were operated from the MGR Chennai Central station (77), followed by Tiruppur and Coimbatore (34 each), Tiruvallur (22) and Chennai Egmore (15).

Following Tamil Nadu, 218 trains originated from stations in Kerala. However, the Kerala government paid the fare for only 53 trains. “Sources in Kerala said that since the State government had spent a lot of money on the welfare of migrant workers, their food, stay and health in the initial period of the lockdown in March and April, it could not afford to pay for their travel. The destination States paid for most trains,” said Mr. Pandiaraja.

While Karnataka operated 21 trains (within the Southern Railway jurisdiction), it paid the fare for 19 trains; Puducherry paid for only one of the three trains that plied from the Union Territory.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/89u6vj/article32866678.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16COVID19CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/centre-did-not-pay-for-shramik-trains-from-tn-rti-reply/article32866679.ece
197,2020/10/16,Project to raise awareness on menstrual hygiene,"Union Minister for Women and Child Development and Textiles Smriti Irani on Thursday launched “My Pad My Right”, a project aiming to empower two million women and create livelihood opportunities for thousands of them.

The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the Nabfoundation and Coimbatore-based Jayaashree Industries have come together to spread awareness on menstrual hygiene across the country and generate employment for women.

“Padman” Arunachalam Muruganantham, chief executive officer of Jayaashree Industries, said it was a pan-India initiative, where centres would be established in every district in all States and Union Territories, and women would be trained to make low-cost sanitary napkins. “Jayaashree Industries has installed 5,000 machines across the country through different agencies and organisations and has trained women to make low-cost sanitary napkins. Under the NABARD project, another 1,500 machines will be installed. We want to do this in a year from now,” he said.

Jayaashree Industries will install the machines and train the women, who can, in turn, train others. The pad-making units, like cottage industries, will provide livelihood opportunities to women. This will spread awareness and empower them. The project will train about 25,000 women initially, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/project-to-raise-awareness-on-menstrual-hygiene/article32866672.ece
198,2020/10/16,Keeping blood pressure in check will prevent COVID-19 morbidity: experts,"A study in China found the death among patients with hypertension was 19%

World Hypertension Day will be observed on Saturday. For the past five years, the theme has been ‘Know Your Numbers’. The theme has been retained as there is little awareness of and efforts to spread the message on the need for controlling blood pressure, say specialists.

A study in China found that the death among those with hypertension and the SARS-CoV-2 infection during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was 19%, whereas it was 6% among those with diabetes, says A. Muruganathan, past president of the Hypertension Society of India and Governor of the Indian chapter of American College of Physicians.

“At a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is raging across the country, the message is to control blood pressure,” he says. “In India, the incidence, morbidity and mortality is three times higher than diabetes. But we don’t have enough hypertension specialists. Across the country, there are less than a dozen specialists.”

A disease that is common but causes three times more mortality, is more intense, and has a high rate of morbidity and mortality remains neglected, he rues. “We must have a two-year course after MBBS so that they are certified as specialists,” he adds. Dr. Muruganathan says there is a need for a centre of excellence for hypertension, similar to what is available in the United States. In conditions like pregnancy, it could prove life-threatening if the blood pressure is not under control, he says.

“COVID-19 can also cause hypertension and there are a dozen reasons for this. If hypertension is under control, COVID will be a normal event. The key message is to control the co-morbid conditions,” he says.

During the lockdown, many people did not go out to get medicine for hypertension. Since there were fewer opportunities to exercise, their blood pressure tended to rise. “Death due to COVID-19 is around 1 lakh but we lose over 17 lakh people to hypertension annually. It is a big economic burden for India. So we need to focus on hypertension and hypertension clinics. The same cuff cannot be used for all persons. We must have three different sized cuffs in the clinic. Also, the BP apparatus must be validated every year so that the readings are accurate,” he says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/qbb342/article29245933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25BLOODPRESSURE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/keeping-blood-pressure-in-check-will-prevent-covid-19-morbidity-experts/article32866582.ece
199,2020/10/16,"Despite relaxations, temples yet to garner revenue","While there are no takers for special entry tickets, cash offerings too have reduced

Despite having reopened for devotees following lockdown relaxations, temples are yet to garner revenue from rents, archanai tickets and special pujas like abhishekam.

Official sources in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department said that though temples were offering special entry tickets, there were hardly any takers for them, since the free queues themselves were not very long. “It takes just ten minutes for devotees to move from the entry to the exit in our temple. And though they may buy special tickets, they too have to stand at the same spot as those coming in through the free darshan queues,” said an official.

A temple official at a relatively smaller temple in Chennai said that many were not even offering cash — thattu kaasu (literally cash on a plate) — to the priests. “Only regulars and those who know the priests and feel for them are giving them anything. Since we are not even accepting flowers from outside, devotees say they don’t feel fulfilled,” the official said.

Even temple hundials have not been getting cash offerings. “We opened the hundials during the lockdown based on orders, but now, after reopening, we are yet to open them, since they are still not full. In most temples, the hundials are not in the marked route, which makes it difficult for devotees to make offerings,” said a temple staffer at a Saivite temple.

The lucky ones

However, some Perumal temples have been lucky, especially due to the auspicious Purattasi month, and they have made decent collections. “Since people have not been able to perform pujas, they have been depositing cash,” said a priest at a Perumal temple.

Without funds, some temples that have deposits are operating with the interest amount they get, and some have just started getting a portion of their rents. Some are wondering how to pay salaries to the staff in the coming months. Priests and other staff hope the government will provide some kind of aid to the temples that are not receiving income.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/v5cw5t/article32866564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THTEMPLES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/despite-relaxations-temples-yet-to-garner-revenue/article32866565.ece
200,2020/10/16,Navarathri golus too go the virtual way,"Residents plan to meet through Zoom

Getting dolled up in the best silk, decking up the house with beautiful bright deities seated aesthetically in various steps, drawing up complex kolams and rustling up a perfect sundal — this is a routine that many look forward to each year. As the pandemic has wreaked havoc and changed routines, golus and vethalapaaku, like other things, will go online this time.

Many residents of the city plan to meet through Zoom or WhatsApp video calls and show their golus to friends this time. Vibha Ram, a resident of RA Puram, says that from seven-step arrangement each year, she has planned to scale it down to three or five this year. “Since it is not safe to visit each other this time, my friends and I have been planning to have a Zoom conference on one of the days. There will be some children who sing, a keyboard and a dance performance too,” she says.

Ramanarayanan of Giri Trading Agency says that while there are people coming over to buy dolls, many of them have resorted to purchasing them online. “At our home too, the celebrations for golu will be scaled down a bit; some important guests will be invited over a couple of a days in a staggered way so as to ensure there is no crowding. With others, we will celebrate through Zoom calls,” he adds.

Golu and dolls will be literally scaled down at Shalini Muthukumar’s residence in Mylapore. With miniature dolls and miniature steps, she will recreate and celebrate golu with a novelty. “I plan to have a small village set-up and found dolls too. Every day, we will have a guest through Zoom call,” she adds.

West Mambalam resident and sari enthusiast Padmapriya Baskaran said her celebrations would be toned down this year.

“I usually present one sari a day during the nine days to guests. But this year I can’t invite people over, so I might either send the thamboolam over through online aggregators or use the ‘motta maadi thaamboolam idea — in flats people have planned to invite flatmates to the terrace and give the thaamboolam to neighbours,” she said.

The integral part of golu is the takeaways — sundal, vethalapaaku and return gifts. E-vethalapakku has emerged as an option with gift boxes that can be delivered to guests on pre-order. Quills and Spills, an online boutique, has been sending out curated gift boxes this Navarathri. Kavitha Govindarajan, its founder, says, “People can’t step out to different stores to buy return gifts. So we have 3-4 packages in different price ranges that people can opt for. From kumkum boxes to festive jewellery boxes to handmade masks, there are varied options that people can order through the Instagram page or website or WhatsApp,” she adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/navarathri-golus-too-go-the-virtual-way/article32866560.ece
201,2020/10/16,"Temperature, oxygen checks must for staff at Secretariat","Secretaries told to purchase thermal scanners, oximeters

The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday issued directions to all Secretaries of departments at the State Secretariat to purchase pulse oximeters and thermal scanners to check oxygen levels and temperature of employees on a daily basis.

The direction was issued by Public Department Principal Secretary, P. Senthilkumar, after nearly 200 staffers have tested positive for COVID-19 in the recent days.

202,2020/10/16,Study advances use of indomethacin for treatment of mild cases,"The drug helps to control dry, persistent cough

A small study from India, but buttressed with a prospective larger study, soon to be published has advanced the case for the use of indomethacin, a powerful anti-inflammatory drug, in low doses, for effective treatment of milder COVID-19 cases.

The case was made in a letter published in International Journal of Medical Reviews and Case Reports (2020) by Ravichandran Rajan, of the Madras Institute of Nephrology; Srinivasan Subramanian of Voluntary Health Services Hospital; and Chritine Clark of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, UK.

Lead author and senior nephrologist Rajan Ravichandran says currently, paracetamol is widely used for symptomatic treatment in COVID-19, but with poor results. “In the paper, we describe our experience in using indomethacin, a low-priced drug, in a small number of patients with COVID-19, including those classified as ‘high-risk’. The results were very encouraging, and that became the basis for a project supported by IIT-Madras, studying the impact of indomethacin in a larger subset of patients, 100, in two hospitals.”

A 2006 Pubmed article by Carla Amici and colleagues from the University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy, identified indomethacin as a potent inhibitor of coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication and suggested that having both anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity, it could be beneficial in SARS therapy.

Dr. Ravichandran adds that indomethacin is a powerful anti-inflammatory drug, one that gives relief even with low doses. The drug helps control the dry, persistent cough that is a common feature among COVID-19 patients.

He says the drug has been used for over 35 years, and with much success. In addition to being an anti-inflammatory, it has anti-viral properties, he argues. “We have also observed its efficiency when we deal with the impact of the cytomegalovirus among post-transplant patients who have poor immunity. It has an effect on suppressing the cytokine release syndrome, and ameliorating the side effects thereof.”

The paper describes 17 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and were treated at home with two doses of indomethacin. All of them were given indomethacin 25mg twice daily. In 14 patients, fever, cough and musculoskeletal pain resolved after two doses. One patient required escalation of dose to 75mg and became asymptomatic after five days. Two patients developed low levels of oxygen saturation and were started on steroids. “Of the 15 patients who became asymptomatic, four were renal transplant recipients, one on maintenance dialysis, two were over 80 years of age, three had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and one was obese.”

“Our approach is to start treatment with a low dose of indomethacin as early as possible in the course of the disease to reduce the severity of symptoms — fever, coughing and musculoskeletal pain. We believe this can reduce the need for hospitalisation and the risk of spreading the disease,” Dr. Ravichandran says.

The preliminary results of the larger study, being conducted in Chennai and Nellore, are also showing positive responses from patients, he says. Only people with adequate oxygen saturation are being taken up for such intervention, he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/study-advances-use-of-indomethacin-for-treatment-of-mild-cases/article32866546.ece

205,2020/10/16,Centre consistently lying on farm laws: CPI,"Party to organise awareness conferences on farm laws from October 28

Communist Party of India (CPI) leader R. Mutharasan on Thursday alleged that the Prime Minister and the Central government were consistently lying about the newly enacted farm laws by repeatedly claiming that they would usher in a change in the lives of the farming community.

Addressing journalists in Tiruchi, he said while protests against the farm laws were going on across the country, the Centre was trying to justify the laws by claiming that it would be beneficial to the farmers. The repeated assertions of the Centre to justify the farms laws were condemnable, he said.

The CPI will conduct special awareness conferences on the Centre’s new farm and labour laws at the zonal level in Thanjavur, Madurai, Salem, Villupuram and Chennai from October 28 to November 4 for the benefit of farmers and labourers. Farmers and labourers would be invited for the special conferences and explained about the problems they would face from the new laws, he said.

The CPI would extend its support to the nationwide strike called by the central trade unions on November 26 against the farm and labour laws and in support of other demands.

207,2020/10/16,BJP’s anti-reservation mindset exposed: Stalin,"‘Party treats social justice as a dispensable commodity’

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Thursday alleged that the affidavit of the Centre in the Supreme Court that it could not implement even 27% reservation for OBCs in the medical seats surrendered by the State government to the central pool had exposed its anti-reservation mindset.

“Ever since the BJP came to power, there is a consistent attack on the reservation policy. It has already denied social justice to the SCs/STs and now the OBCs are sidelined in the administration,” he charged in a statement.

Mr. Stalin said even though the Madras High Court had ordered implementation of 50% reservation, the Centre had filed an affidavit opposing even 27% reservation.

He said though Prime Minister Narendra Modi had claimed that he was a representative of the OBCs in the country, his government was undermining the 27% reservation for the OBCs in education and employment opportunities in the Central government as recommended by the Mandal Commission.

208,2020/10/16,Former MLA Vetrivel dead,"After a split in AIADMK, he joined Dhinakaran’s AMMK

P. Vetrivel, treasurer of the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) and former legislator, died at a private hospital on Thursday due to septicemia.

He was 60 and is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters.

According to a release from Sri Ramachandra Hospital where Vetrivel was undergoing treatment for COVID-19 since October 6, he was shifted to ICU on October 9 and was on ventilator.

Shot into prominence

After the 1996 local body elections in the State, Vetrivel shot into prominence as the floor leader of the Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) and leader of the opposition in the Chennai Corporation Council.

When the TMC merged with the Congress in August 2002, Vetrivel defected to the AIADMK on the ground that he was opposed to the merger. Till then, he was considered a confidant of G.K. Vasan, who became a secretary of the AICC after the TMC (M)’s merger with the Congress.

Vetrivel made his first attempt to enter the Assembly in 2001 when he contested as the TMC (M)’s candidate in Purasawalkam and lost by around 3,800 votes. In 2011, he got elected to the House from R.K. Nagar.

Four years later, he vacated his seat, paving the way for Jayalalithaa, who lost her posts of Chief Minister and MLA in the wake of her conviction in a disproportionate assets case in September 2014.

In 2016, he returned to the House from Perambur. When the AIADMK suffered a split a few months after the death of Jayalalithaa, he sided with the camp led by V.K. Sasikala and later, her nephew T.T.V. Dhinakaran.

In September 2017, Vetrivel and 17 other pro-Dhinakaran MLAs were disqualified for having “voluntarily given up” their membership of the AIADMK.

On the eve of polling for the R.K. Nagar by election in December 2017 when Mr. Dhinakaran emerged victorious, Vetrivel created a sensation, releasing a video showing the former Chief Minister at hospital. During the April-May 2019 by elections for 22 Assembly constituencies, he again contested from Perambur and lost badly, getting 6,281 votes.

Mr. Dhinakaran, in his condolence message, described the former legislator as one who expressed his views forthrightly and said his party’s flag would fly at half mast for a week.

209,2020/10/16,Highest procurement of grain till date: Minister,"Kamaraj replies to Stalin’s call for opening more DPCs

The Tamil Nadu government procured 32.41 lakh metric tonnes of food grain from farmers through Direct Procurement Centres (DPCs) between October 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020 — the highest ever in Tamil Nadu — Food Minister R. Kamaraj said on Thursday.

Responding to DMK president M.K. Stalin’s comment that more procurement centres needed to be opened and grains be bought without a ceiling, the Minister said during this period, 2,130 DPCs had been opened, compared to 1,500 normally.

Historic high

“This is a historic high and even the procurement is historically high this year. The previous highest procurement by the government was in 2011-12, when 23.87 lakh metric tonnes of grain was procured,” he said in an official statement.

Mr. Kamaraj said ₹6,130 crore for procurement had been paid directly to the farmers, benefiting 5,85,241 people.

“Beginning with the Kuruvai harvest period, 816 DPCs are currently functioning and since October 1, 1.55 lakh metric tonnes have been procured, the highest in a Kuruvai harvest season,” he said.

According to Mr. Kamaraj, since only 1,000 sacks can be procured in a DPC, District Collectors had been authorised to open additional centres in case more grain is brought by farmers to the centres on any given day.

The Minister denied Mr. Stalin’s allegations that DPCs were not procuring all the grain.

In Kollidam, he said, 28 DPCs had been opened and 7,037 metric tonnes had been procured till date and the process is ongoing, said Mr. Kamaraj.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/iuux6w/article32866251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16KAMARAJ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/highest-procurement-of-grain-till-date-minister/article32866252.ece
210,2020/10/16,Medical OBC quota not possible this year: Centre,"The National Medical Commission and the Centre informed the Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday that it is not possible to extend reservation benefits to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in medical and dental seats contributed towards the All India Quota (AIQ) by State government-run colleges in Tamil Nadu this year.

Appearing before a Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao, advocate Gaurav Sharma, for the National Medical Commission (NMC), said students had filled their application forms for NEET in January-February itself. “They had also filled the category under which they were applying. The NEET results would also show this category... The OBC reservation was not open then in January-February,” Mr. Sharma submitted.

Mr. Sharma said the reservation roster had already been fixed by the Directorate General of Health Services.

The NEET results will be out on October 16, and counselling will be held within a week.

“Implementing this OBC quota for this year (in Tamil Nadu) is not possible,” Mr. Sharma submitted.

Additional Solicitor General Balbir Singh agreed with this.

They were responding to queries from the court as to whether it was possible to implement the OBC reservation this academic year in the State.

The development came even as the Madras High Court (HC), in July this year, had directed the Centre to form a committee and fix the percentage and other terms of OBC reservation from next year. The High Court had not wanted to disturb the admission process this year.

The Tamil Nadu government and various political parties across the spectrum, from the ruling AIADMK, represented by advocate Balaji Srinivasan, to the Opposition DMK, represented by senior advocate P. Wilson, had appealed to the top court, calling for implementation of the quota benefits for successful NEET candidates this year.

211,2020/10/16,Policy meet on M-sand in November,"The policy will have a legal framework for production and sales

With rising complaints on the unregulated sale of sub-standard M-sand, the Public Works Department (PWD) will convene a meeting with stakeholders on an M-sand policy in November.

The policy, which will have a legal framework for production and sale, is expected to be implemented early next year.

The meeting will be held with representatives of government agencies like the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and the Department of Mining, and manufacturing units and lorry owners’ associations.

PWD officials said the meeting would discuss various aspects of M-sand production, transport and sales and incorporate more guidelines into the policy under consideration.

The decision follows a representation from the Tamil Nadu Sand Lorry Owners Federation on Wednesday for measures against unauthorised manufacturing units, sale of poor quality M-sand and seizure of vehicles for overloading. On an average, 33,000 loads of M-sand is being transported daily.

Federation president Sella. Rajamani said 200-300 units were functioning in the State without government approval. There was no check on indiscriminate quarrying and transport of M-sand to other States, and this would lead to the disappearance of hillocks, he said. “Vehicles are overloaded with M-sand and additional units of sand are not billed. But vehicles are seized and fined instead of manufacturing units or clients,” he said.

The Federation has also sought regulation of the M-sand cost and a separate enforcement wing to curb over-exploitation of mineral resources.

At present, 270 M-sand manufacturing units have sought the PWD’s quality approval, and 40 applications are being processed. Nearly 1,070 units have sought consent from the TNPCB to operate across the State.

A PWD official said: “We will also discuss incorporating a provision for periodical inspection of quarries in the M-sand policy to prevent over-exploitation of resources. Measures against overloading of vehicles and offenders will also be discussed, as requested by lorry owners. We have also received complaints of transport of M-sand immediately after wet processing.”

The policy would empower the PWD to take legal action against unauthorised manufacturing units. Sales of poor quality sand or manufacturing M-sand without licence may attract a fine of up to ₹5 lakh and imprisonment of up to two years.

“We can only emphasise quality approval now. Once the policy is in place, the PWD would have powers, along with other Departments, to monitor and control units that function without approval,” said an official.

On the demand for direct sales of M-sand by the government, sources said it would be a complicated legal process as nearly 70% of the crushed stone quarries were of private ownership and the rest were leased out by the government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/uc1yfg/article19276297.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14MANUFACTUREDSAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/policy-meet-on-m-sand-in-november/article32865969.ece

215,2020/10/16,TJS loses its match box symbol in State elections,"TJS failed to contest from at least 10% seats in ULB polls

The State Election Commission has cancelled the symbols allotted to six registered political parties, including the match box symbol allotted to Telangana Jana Samiti headed by M. Kodandaram, for failing to fulfil the conditions stipulated under the rules governing the matter.

The TJS was allotted the ‘match box’ symbol in the elections held for the rural local bodies and the symbol continued in the elections to municipalities and corporations that were held subsequently. According to rules in Part-III of Symbols Order, 2018, the political parties which are allotted common symbols will lose the symbol if they failed to contest in at least 10 % of the total seats in the particular elections.

The parties cannot apply afresh for the symbol till the completion of the five years period from the date of allotment of common symbol. In the process, they will also forfeit the deposit amount of ₹ 10,000 remitted for the symbol.

“Though we fulfilled the condition in mandal parishad and gram panchayat elections, we did not contest the requisite number of seats in the subsequent elections to urban local bodies,” a senior Telangana Jana Samiti leader said.

State Election Commission officials told The Hindu that fielding candidates to at least 10 % of the seats was mandatory and the decision to cancel the symbols allotted to the registered parties would be taken after examining whether the respective parties fulfilled the stipulations or not. “The TJS has failed to fulfil the requisite conditions and hence, the cancellation of the symbol,” a senior SEC official told The Hindu.

Symbols of five other parties Jana Shankaaraavam Party (Bat), BC United Front (Battery Torch), Mana Telangana Rashtra Samiakhya Party (Whistle), Praja Sena Party (Cup and Saucer), Samajwadi Forward Bloc Party (Scissors) and Yuva Telangana Party (Gas Cylinder) were also cancelled and they forfeited their deposit amount. “The deposit amount for symbols was much higher at Rs. 1 lakh.

217,2020/10/16,Telangana extends bidding for new Secretariat complex,"Last date for submission of the tenders is October 20

Evaluation of tenders for construction of the new integrated Secretariat complex has been deferred yet again.

The Roads and Buildings Department, which invited tenders for the construction of the new integrated complex, has announced that the last date for submission of the tenders has been extended to October 20. According to the revised notification issued by the department, the last date of submission for tenders initially was October 13 and the technical bids were expected to be decided on the same day.

The latest move comes despite revision of the tender notification issued last month extending the time line for submission of the bids. The government has proposed to construct the new complex at an estimated ₹500 crore and the cost has gone up to close to ₹630 crore subsequently, following inclusion of several other structures along with the master plan for the complex.

Tender notices had been issued for identification of prospective bidders and the last date of filing the bids was revised twice. In the first instance, the construction value of the new secretariat was pegged at ₹ 400 crore, which received the consent of the State cabinet and this was subsequently revised to ₹ 500 crore. The escalation in the cost of the construction was attributed to inclusion of staff quarters and related facilities for the staff as well as security mechanism.

“Tender submission date has been postponed till October 20 in view of heavy rains and public holidays,” a senior official connected with the process told The Hindu.

Telangana is inching towards two lakh COVID-19-recovered cases. From March 2 to October 14, a total of 2,17,670 people in the State were detected with coronavirus. Of them, 1,93,218 people have won the fight over the infectious disease. While the recovery rate across the country is 87.3%, it is 88.76% in the State.

Spike or drop in the number of positive cases detected in a day depends on the number of tests performed. Upon skimming through data from the past few weeks provided by the Telangana Health department, it was found that over 2,100 people are detected with coronavirus if around 55,000 tests are performed in a day. And the positive cases drop if the number of tests decrease. Regardless of such tests, around 1,900 to 2,500 people are declared to have recovered every day. On Wednesday, 1,949 people had recovered.

As per available details, a 103-year-old man, Paruchuri Ramaswamy, who resides in Hyderabad is the oldest person in the State to have won over COVID-19. He was admitted at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and later shifted to Gandhi Hospital, both government hospitals. Patients with life-threatening diseases or medical conditions such as cancer, kidney failure, too have survived.

Doctors who attend the patients in government hospitals have earlier said that their treatment protocols have improved over the time.

224,2020/10/16,PIL petition over Khammam cable operators’ alleged GST evasion,"Plea likely to be heard by the High Court in a day or two

A PIL petition was filed in Telangana High Court seeking a direction to Union Ministry of Finance to launch an investigation into alleged evasion of Goods and Service Tax (GST) by six cable service operators in Khammam town.

A social worker N. Rama Rao of Wyra in Khammam, who filed the petition, requested the court to direct Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to ensure the cable operators pay to the Centre the GST they had collected from the subscribers.

The petitioner charged that the cable operators, who are also known as Multi System Operators (MSOs), are bound to register with the authorities and pay GST under the GST Act.

He stated that the TRAI had replied, to a question under RTI Act, that none of the six MSOs in Khammam district were registered with the Centre. They had not paid any GST so far, the petitioner said quoting TRAI reply.

The GST Assistant Commissioner of Khammam’s reply to a similar question suggested that the MSOs were not paying GST to the government.

According to the petitioner, there are nearly one lakh households in Khammam town. If even 50% of them are availing cable services, there would be 50,000 subscribers.

Siti Cable Network, Siti Digital Network, Hathway, Bright Way Communications, NXT Digital and Act Fibernet were the cable operators in Khammam town, the petitioner stated. In a package of ₹154, each subscriber is charged with ₹24 towards GST.

That translates to ₹12 lakh collection of GST every month by the MSOs from the subscribers.

Since the GST was being collected since 2017, the total sum collected by the cable operators from subscribers would be nearly ₹1.44 crore so far, the petitioner said.

Replies from the TRAI and the GST authorities made it clear that the cable operators were evading payment of tax to the government.

He requested the court to declare the inaction of TRAI and GST authorities against the erring cable operators as illegal and arbitrary.

The plea is likely to be heard by the HC in a day or two.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3g7von/article19105162.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-gst-afp,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pil-petition-over-khammam-cable-operators-alleged-gst-evasion/article32865926.ece

Though the Congress put its bets on Induraj Narwal, the BJP again reposed faith in Olympic medalist and renowned wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt as the joint candidate of the ruling coalition. Mr. Dutt had lost to Congress’ Shri Krishan Hooda by a margin of around 4,800 votes in the Assembly election last year. The bypoll has been necessitated due to demise of the Congress MLA in April.

Accompanying the party candidate for his filing of nomination, Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the Congress had given ticket to a grassroots worker from a common farmer family on the demand of the people of Baroda. He said this was not just an election to make an MLA but a fight for the honour of Baroda and the future of Haryana. The State party chief Kumari Selja and Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda were also present.

Though the Hoodas strongly favoured Mr. Kapoor Singh Narwal’s candidature, the party decided on the name of Mr. Induraj Narwal after Ms. Selja insisted on a party worker as the candidate, party sources said. Since the Hoodas have strong political influence in the region, they have higher stakes than the party itself. However, with four major Jat candidates in the fray, the odds are stacked against the Congress. Though the result for the election will have little political bearing with the ruling coalition having a comfortable majority.

Mr. Kapoor Singh Narwal, who was also among the BJP probables for the seat, has filed his nomination as an Independent with support from Meham Independent MLA Balraj Kundu. Mr. Kundu said the Congress had fielded a “dummy” candidate and Mr. Narwal, with the support of the locals, would record a landslide win.

Addressing a gathering prior to the nomination of Mr. Dutt, BJP State chief O.P. Dhankar said the people of Baroda had accepted the young, honest and eminent wrestler as the party’s candidate rising above the caste politics.

While the Indian National Lok Dal fielded Joginder Malik, former BJP MP and Loktantra Suraksha Party chief RajKumar Saini is also in the fray.

A total of 24 nominations were filed for the bypoll. Last date to withdraw nominations is October 19. The polling will be held on November 3, a week before the counting of votes on November 10.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7h8ehs/article32876463.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE17FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-congress-candidates-file-nominations-for-baroda-bypoll/article32876464.ece
227,2020/10/16,Brother of Ballia gunman held; BJP MLA backs accused,"Police face allegations of letting accused flee after the firing

A day after a man was shot dead in Ballia even as police and district officials looked on, the brother of the main accused, who is linked to the BJP, was arrested. The local BJP MLA meanwhile defended the murder as an act of “self-defence” and accused the administration of “one-sided” action.

The police also face allegations of letting the accused flee from the spot after he fired the fatal shots.

The victim was shot dead after a dispute broke out between two groups during a village meeting over the selection process of a government ration shop in Ballia on Thursday.

Tej Pratap Pal, the brother of the deceased Jai Prakash, alleged that immediately after the firing in Durjanpur village, the police caught the accused Dhirendra Pratap Singh but then let him escape.

“When he was fleeing after firing, the administration caught him from behind but took him to a nearby embankment and allowed him to escape,” Mr. Tej Pratap told reporters.

Bairia MLA Surendra Singh admitted that the accused was an associate of his and also that he supported the BJP during both the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections as a karyakarta.

“How can I say he is not my associate? The truth is he was an associate of the BJP, too. But since the firing incident is unfortunate, we can’t call it good,” he said.

Mr. Singh said though he condemned the firing incident, he was also against the “one-sided” action by the administration and media coverage. The supporters of the deceased person has initiated the violence and used lathis and rods, injuring six men and two women on the side of Dhirendra Pratap Singh, he claimed.

“If Dhirendra Singh had not fired in self-defence, dozens of his relatives would have been killed,” the MLA claimed, demanding action also against the victim’s supporters.

The brother of the deceased also accused the police of shielding the accused during the incident and instead hitting the people on the victim side.

‘None will be spared’

Braj Bhushan, ADG Varanasi, said Devendra Pratap Singh, the brother of Dhirendra Pratap, was arrested while 10 teams had been formed to nab the other accused. The FIR names eight accused persons while others are unidentified. “None of the accused will be spared,” he said, adding that all the police personnel posted on the spot have been suspended.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/brother-of-ballia-gunman-held-bjp-mla-backs-accused/article32876455.ece

229,2020/10/16,13 horrific cases in U.P. in a week: Priyanka,"‘Women feeling unsafe in State as Yogi government is protecting criminals’

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday targeted the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh on the issue of women’s safety and alleged that 13 horrific incidents of crimes against women have taken place in just one week.

“In the last one week, 13 horrific incidents of crime against women have occurred in U.P. As per reports, victims have been killed or the victims committed suicide in four such incidents,” Ms. Vadra tweeted.

“This poor condition of women safety is disturbing. The Chief Minister has no time to convene a ‘special session’ but his photo session is on,” she said.

She shared a chart of various instances of crimes against women across Uttar Pradesh — from Noida to Gonda, Jhasi to Pratapgarh — between October 9 and 15 and alleged that the BJP is giving “protection” to the criminals, making women feel unsafe in the State.

The Congress general secretary, who is in-charge for U.P., has been attacking the Yogi government over law and order and launched a major campaign on women security after the Hathras rape and murder case.

At the party’s media briefing, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate referred to Thursday’s incident at Ballia where a person was shot dead in the presence of government officials and policemen following a fight over allotment of a ration shop.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/g2470t/article32876074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THCONG-PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/13-horrific-cases-in-up-in-a-week-priyanka/article32876075.ece
230,2020/10/16,"Police deserter escapes in gunfight, aide held in Budgam","Six persons arrested for providing logistics to militants for carrying out attacks on Srinagar-Jammu highway

Just two days after a policeman deserted the service to join militancy, security forces on Friday engaged him in a gunfight in central Kashmir’s Budgam where he managed to escape but his associate was arrested.

Meanwhile, police held six persons for providing logistics to militants for carrying out attacks on the Srinagar-Jammu national highway in the last two months.

“On a specific input, the Special Police Officer [SPO], who deserted the police and decamped with two AK 47 rifles, along with his associate, was trapped in the Chadoora area of Budgam. They fired indiscriminately and the SPO managed to escape from the spot,” Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar said.

Mr. Kumar said his associate was, however, captured alive. “The captured associate was identified as Jahangir Ahmad Bhat, an overground worker and a notorious stone pelter. One of the missing AK 47 rifles was recovered from his possession,” the IGP said.

Mr. Kumar said the security forces showed “maximum restraint by arresting the terrorist associate during the live encounter.” “I appeal to the family of the SPO Altaf to help police in bringing him back,” he added.

Meanwhile, the police said they arrested six militant associates “who had provided shelter, transportation and also conducted recce of the security force deployments” on the highway in the Valley.

“Police teams carried out a series of raids in Budgam’s Chadoora, Srinagar’s Nowgam and other areas and picked up around a dozen suspects for questioning. Six militant associates were found providing logistics to the attackers. A house was also located where they would hide,” Mr. Kumar said.

The police seized six vehicles, “which were used to carry out these terror attacks.”

These six youths were accused of being part of attacks that took place from August 14 to October 5 within the jurisdiction of the Nowgam police station and Chadoora.

“These incidents included an attack at Gulshan Nagar in Nowgam, in which two personnel were killed and one INSAS rifle was snatched and an attack on CRPF at Kaisarmullah Chadoora, in which one CRPF personnel was killed and his weapon snatched. Besides, the attack on CRPF’s 110 Battalion near Taingan New Bypass, which left two jawans dead and four others injured,” the police said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/i7d4c6/article32875997.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THKASHMIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/police-deserter-escapes-in-gunfight-aide-held-in-budgam/article32875998.ece
231,2020/10/16,Rehab policy for Kashmiri youth joining terror in the works: senior Army officer,"Promoting surrenders and reducing recruitment a top priority, he says

A rehabilitation policy for the local youths joining terrorism in the Kashmir Valley is in the works and if approved “it will make some difference”, according to Lt. Gen. BS Raju, General Officer Commanding Army’s 15 Corps.

“The policy has been made, it has been sent, it has gone up the chain. It has not yet come back. The message I have given to the population is irrespective of the policy existing or not existing, we are ready to go on board and we will do what is appropriate. If the policy comes in, it will give us more strength in offering that as a viable option,” he stated on Friday. “It will make some difference.”

The draft policy awaits Home Ministry approval.

Lt. Gen. Raju said the more important thing was that he would be able to speak about it and take that proposal in a more formal manner. Pointing out that there existed policy for those who had gone across to Pakistan to come back, he asserted that a large number of them did come back. “The new policy is for people who have taken up arms within the Valley.”

Encouraging surrenders

In this direction, the focus was on encouraging surrenders by the local youths taking up arms by reaching out to families as well as reduce local recruitment. In every operation, they attempted to get people back. Also, a large number of families were now coming out and saying they wanted their children to come back. A number of people had come back. These were not publicised for obvious reasons. “But they do come back, and we take care of them,” he noted.

“We will be doing more work on the issue of surrenders. Because for us, getting a man back is more important than neutralizing him. And that is a work in progress. Through our actions, we want to reach out to people in a manner where there should be ‘little reason for people to take up arms’,” Lt. Gen. Raju observed.

“The Army is one part of many components in play. So we will do our part to ensure that we conduct our business in a professional manner, so that we do not become the cause for anybody to cross. Suffice to say that it is definitely on the radar and that will a very important line of action to stop recruitment or reduce recruitment.” he stressed.

People who had joined terrorism were being told that they could come back. “Mainly because you held a gun and took a photo does not mean you have to die. So, people who have got the weapon have also come back. And that is bigger success to us.”

On infiltration from across the Line of Control (LoC), he said they have been able to stop it substantially by a combination of various factors such as deploying additional personnel and using technology like employment of drones among others.

Ceasefire violations

On ceasefire vilations across the LoC in the 15 Corps area, he said that in the beginning of the year it was at its peak but had come down and under control now, including use of heavy calibre weapons.

“In the hinterland, we have been able to keep the violence level at a threshold, at a level where normal people can continue to do their job. We have been able to keep the terrorist numbers also in fair amount of control,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/heastb/article32875060.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LTGENBSRAJU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rehab-policy-for-kashmiri-youth-joining-terror-in-the-works-senior-army-officer/article32875061.ece
232,2020/10/16,Anti-Khalistan activist shot dead in Punjab,"B.S. Sandhu was awarded Shaurya Chakra in 1993 for resisting terrorists

Recipient of Shaurya Chakra award Balwinder Singh Sandhu, who had fought against terrorism in Punjab for years, was shot dead on Friday by unidentified assailants at his native Bhikhiwind village in Tarn Taran district, police said.

Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta said Mr. Sandhu was killed by two unknown assailants at his home in Bhikhiwind, at around 7 a.m.

“He died on the spot. A CCTV footage from the area shows that two unknown assailants arrived at the house of the deceased in the morning and one of them entered the premises and fired at Balwinder Singh at point blank range. The details of the vehicle and its registration number are being probed,” said the DGP.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh ordered the constitution of a Special Investigative Team (SIT) headed by DIG Ferozepur to probe all angles in attack. The SIT has already formed four special teams to crack the case.

“Three-four bullets were pumped into Mr. Sandhu, the exact details, however, could be ascertained only after the postmortem report, which is awaited,” Jagjit Singh, Superintendent of Police (Investigation), Tarn Taran told The Hindu.

“We have registered the case against unknown persons under Section 302 among other sections of Indian Penal Code, besides Arms Act and investigation was underway. We are investigating the matter from all angles and we are hopeful to of arresting them soon,” he said.

Mr. Sandhu was awarded the Shaurya Chakra in 1993 for his exemplary courage as he alongwith his family strongly opposed the Khalistani movement and terrorism for many years. The Shaurya Chakra is a military decoration, which maybe awarded to civilians also, for valour, courageous action or self-sacrifice while not engaged in direct action with the enemy.

Pointing out that Mr. Sandhu has been the target of terrorists earlier also, his wife Jagdish Kaur alleged that his security cover was withdrawn earlier this year even though the family had been on the hit list of terrorists.

Reacting to the allegation Mr. Jagjit said, “During the COVID-19 outbreak there were some (security) changes for everyone. We will check that too.”

According to the Shaurya Chakra citation (1993): “Shri Balwinder Singh Sandhu and his brother Ranjeet Singh Sandhu are opposed to the activities of the terrorists. They are obviously in the hit list of the terrorists. The terrorists have so far made 16 attempts to wipe out the Sandhu family within a span of about 11 months. The terrorists attacked them in groups of 10 to 200, but everytime the Sandhu brothers with the help of their brave wives, Smt. Jagdish Kaur Sandhu and Smt. Balraj Kaur Sandhu have successfully foiled the attempts of militants to kill them. The first attack on Sandhu family was made on 31st January 1990, and the last on 28th December 1991. But the deadliest attack was made on 30th September, 1990. On that day, about 200 terrorists surrounded the Sandhu’s house from all sides and attacked them continuously for 5 hours with deadly weapons including rocket launchers. The attack was well planned and the approach road of the house was blocked by spreading underground gun mines so that no help from police forces could reach them.

“Undaunted, the Sandhu brothers and their wives fought the terrorists with their pistols and sten guns provided by the Government. The resistance shown by the Sandhu brothers and their family members forced the terrorists to retreat. All these persons have displayed courage and bravery of a high order in facing the attack of the terrorists and foiling their repeated murderous attempts.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/anti-khalistan-activist-shot-dead-in-punjab/article32874756.ece
233,2020/10/16,"People are realising that with a brute majority, the BJP is suppressing a lot of issues, says Jayant Chaudhary","Rashtriya Lok Dal vice-president says the BJP has indulged in a dehumanising experiment with the Hathras incident’s narrative

Rashtriya Lok Dal vice-president Jayant Chaudhary speaks to The Hindu ahead of the upcoming Assembly by-polls in Uttar Pradesh, and days after he was lathi-charged by police while going to Hathras to meet the family of the rape victim.

Your party has fielded a candidate in the upcoming by-poll in Bulandshar and is supporting the Samajwadi Party (SP) in the other six seats. Is this your direction for the 2022 election as well?

Yes. We have been consistent on this. We tied up with them in the previous Lok Sabha, and in the long term, that is the kind of direction we want to give to U.P. Today, people are realising that with a brute majority, how the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is actually suppressing a lot of issues that should have been a priority on the development front. And all it is talking about is Mughals, love jihad and divisive issues. With Akhilesh’s [SP’s Akhilesh Yadav] leadership and track record, and our grassroot connect, I think we can actually give an alternative to the voters.

Did you expect the police to lathi-charge you in Hathras? Their explanation was that Opposition workers were breaching the COVID-19 protocol.

No. As far as COVID goes, it gets very convenient because you get more people walking in a street market in any town in U.P. When incidents like these [the Hathras murder and alleged gang-rape] happen, people want to reach out to the family and express solidarity. The key operative thing here is that I was escorted past the barricade. The barricade is there to maintain order. It was the police’s failure that they could not enforce the barricade restriction. There were five-six people on the other side of the barricade. What was the need to lathi-charge? We were not posing any threat. If you look at the police manual in U.P. and the Supreme Court decisions, there are actually procedures in place. You have to give a warning. You need the presence of an administrative official. The SDM (Sub-Divisional Magistrate) was there, but he did not give any verbal warning. It was a violation of our rights as citizens. In the political space, we are an Opposition, but I never really thought that we will have to encounter something like that.

Has there been a change in the attitude of the U.P. Police since 2017 under the Yogi Adityanath government?

Top down, there is an impunity. Reward structures are put in place to reward violent behaviour and action by the police, whether it is encounters, shooting someone, or a lathi charge...this [is the] notion of strict policing. Yes, we need strict policing in U.P. but we also need sensitive policing. And the Hathras incident — they should have been more sensitive. Their handling of the family, of the complaint, and of the Opposition leaders who wanted to reach out, I think in all three aspects, it showed a very insensitive side of the police. And Yogi-ji is the [State] Home Minister. Who else will we hold responsible?

A section of the media is arguing that because of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s ventures in U.P., the Congress is emerging as the leading Opposition in the State, threatening to dislodge the SP and its allies. Is that too far-fetched?

The Congress has always been there. It is not a new party. And it’s there in the national stage also. So you can never count the Congress out. Every party is making its own efforts. But it’s easier for the Congress because they are a mainstream national party and what they do perhaps gets more coverage. But they have no extraordinary impact on the grassroots right now.

Do you feel the BJP has a weak link in Yogi Adityanath's personal image?

The BJP’s political strategy is to talk in many voices. From being a right [-wing] party, they have also gone a little bit extreme to the right and Yogi is also in the same framework. I think U.P. deserves a modern approach and a leader with a big and liberal heart. I think that space will exist for us to attack Yogi and the BJP. This hard-nosed ‘might is right’ sort of politics cannot survive in the long run.

There is an emerging allegation that the BJP government under Yogi Adityanath is appeasing Thakurs, the caste he was born into. Do you think such a thing exists and will it have an impact in the coming future?

The people who belong to the caste of the CM, either in arrogance or affinity, they feel it is ‘hamari sarkari’ (our government). You actually need a CM who can be a moral guiding force and then can tame his or her own supporters. On the other hand, what Yogiji is doing is he is not restraining anybody.

It won't be proper for me say if they are doing Thakurvad or not but definitely there are visible signs and discussion is on, the onus is on Yogi ji. Only he can address this issue, whether it is real or a political tool being deployed. So far, the perception is growing.

You are already on the ground and held mahapanchayats with SP in Muzaffarnagar, Mathura and now Bulandshar after the lathi-charge incident. You are opposed to the three new farms bills. What are you you telling the voters?

On the farm bills, UP is affected differently like every other state. Since May, UP relaxed some laws and a lot of crops were taken out of APMC. The market infrastructure was already getting dismantled. Now these bills have come about and they have raised a real concern on what will happen because eventually over 5-10 years if the market shifts to trade outside mandis into private hands, will they crowd out the state? And what will be the role of these mandis? Will government stop purchasing from farmers. What will be the viability of MSP? These are the concerns that should have been addressed. But a government that is so eloquent in communicating its political messages in election time it has been is a atypical failure in communication [on farm bills].

The farmer leaders of Haryana and Punjab stormed out of the Krishi Bhawan completely disgruntled and tore the bills. You have a crisis in Punjab, because farmers are sitting there on a rail roko. But somehow the national mainstream reporting is not showing the alarm that should be there. And nor is the government responding. It is clear no farmer or farmer organization actually asked for these changes or reforms. They are unpalatable for the farmer but they are being told it is beneficial for them.

What do you feel about the government’s repeated allegations that Opposition leaders were trying to trigger a caste riot over the Hathras incident? Does this incident have the potential to create a caste divide in the region?

It is so easy when an upper caste Chief Minister, who openly bandies about his caste affiliation, or at least those allegations are being openly talked about in the political corridors, talks about crime not being caste-specific. When, in fact, we do know that the weaker sections on many occasions actually get targeted. There is a reason why the Home Ministry and the NCRB (National Crime Records Bureau) collect data on Dalit atrocities. And Dalit women are often targets of such crimes. As per the latest report of 2019, 10 Dalit women are raped daily. You cannot just ignore that aspect. I am not here to add fuel to the fire, but when I visited the family, we saw and heard of panchayats [by caste groups] happening...It is really shocking that — you saw it in Kashmir and now in U.P. — you have public mobilisation to garner support for a rape accused. It has never happened in our country before. We have had agitations to support the victim. In the 2012 Delhi rape case, people came on their own accord where they felt empathy. This is a dehumanising experiment that the BJP has indulged in.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ja4pw0/article32874009.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAYANTCHAUDHARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/people-are-realising-that-with-a-brute-majority-the-bjp-is-suppressing-a-lot-of-issues-says-jayant-chaudhary/article32874010.ece

In a shocking incident, four minor siblings were found brutally murdered on Friday morning in Jalgaon’s Raver taluk in north Maharashtra, 440 km from here.

According to the police, the children — two boys and two girls — aged between five and 14 years, were hacked to death with an axe in Raver’s Borkheda village while their parents were away.

Officials suspect that all the children were killed with the same axe. The motive for the crime has yet to be ascertained. No arrests have been made as yet.

Mehtab, along with his wife and their older son, had reportedly gone to their native village in Madhya Pradesh’s Khargone district when the murders occurred on the intervening night between Thursday and Friday.

The farm owner later discovered the bodies of the children lying in a pool of blood today morning, along with the alleged murder weapon lying next to the victims.

235,2020/10/16,Section 144 clamped in parts of Guwahati over intel inputs on terrorists seeking hideouts,"People dealing in properties were also asked to furnish details of the tenants to the OC of the police station concerned

The Assam administration has imposed Section 144 CrPC in the Central Police District of Guwahati over intelligence inputs that terrorists or anti- social elements may seek hideouts in residential areas with the motive to breach the peace, police said on Friday.

Ranveer, Deputy Commissioner of Police of the Guwahati Central Police District, issued an order on Thursday asking the landlords not to rent out accommodation to any person until he/she furnishes his/her particulars to the officer-in- charge of the police station concerned.

“Reports received that due to the situation prevailing in the area of Central Police District, Guwahati, it is apprehended that terrorists/anti-social elements may seek hideouts in the residential area,” said police.

“There is every likelihood of breach of peace and disturbances of public tranquility and also there is likelihood of grave danger to human life and safety and injury of public property on that account,” it said.

The order, however, did not specify the “prevailing situation” in the Central Police District of Guwahati.

“It is necessary that some checks should be put on landlords/tenants so that terrorists/anti-social elements in the guise of tenant may not cause explosion, riot, shootout, affray, etc., and that immediate action is necessary for the prevention of the same,” the order said.

People dealing in properties were also asked to furnish details of the tenants to the OC of the police station concerned.

The order shall come into force with immediate effect and shall remain in force for 60 days unless withdrawn earlier, it said.

Any person contravening the order shall be punishable under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), it added.

236,2020/10/16,Use Durga Puja dole only for COVID-19 prevention steps: HC,"The money can’t be used for purposes such as conducting any Puja activity, musical soiree or entertainment of organisers, it says

The Calcutta High Court on Friday directed that the money allocated by the West Bengal government to Durga Puja committees should be used only for improving community policing and procuring masks and sanitizers for containing the spread of COVID-19.

A division bench of Justices Sanjib Banerjee and Arijit Banerjee, in an interim order, said the money allocated could not be used for any other purpose such as conducting any Puja activity, musical soiree or entertainment of the organisers.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, on September 24, announced that the government would give ₹50,000 to each of the 37,000 clubs across the State.

According to the court, 75% of the money should be used only for procurement of masks, sanitizers and face shields and 25% for strengthening police - public bonding and inclusion of more women in community policing.

“During the hearing, government counsel said the money allocated to clubs is not for Puja but for certain schemes such community policing and distributing masks and sanitizer, etc. The court, on the basis of that statement said that not a single rupee should be spent on Puja,” Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, counsel for petitioner Sourav Ghosh said.

The bench observed that the announcement made by the Chief Minister while announcing the allocation of funds and the government’s notification were on two different lines. She had highlighted the financial stress faced by Durga Puja committees while announcing financial aid. The government notification, however, referred that money would be spent on community policing and distribution of masks.

‘Complete bluff’

Reacting to the interim order, Mr. Bhattacharya said the development proved that the announcement made by the Chief Minister was a “complete bluff”. The court in its interim order also directed that bills of masks and sanitisers’ procurement should be submitted to the Sub Divisional Officers (SDO) of the districts and the Kolkata Police for thorough auditing and report on this would be submitted to the court.

The case will come up for hearing again after the vacation.

The government started giving money to Durga Puja clubs in 2018.

237,2020/10/16,New group to revive Bodoland statehood stir,"Led by former MP Sansuma K. Bwismwmuthiary, the apolitical organisation says new Bodo peace accord is unacceptable for the largest plains tribe in Northeast

A new organisation has announced the revival of the Bodoland statehood movement ahead of the elections to the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC).

The five-decade-old demand for a separate State for the Bodos, the largest plains tribe in the Northeast, was said to have ended with the signing of the third peace accord on January 27 for transforming the BTC into the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) with additional powers.

But the All India Bodo People’s National League for Bodoland Statehood has vowed to rekindle the statehood movement. Members of this league, formed on October 15, panned the BTR accord, which they said would spell disaster for the Bodo community.

“Unlike the 2003 accord that gave us the BTC, the new accord has been a betrayal of the Bodo people. Besides being an inferior accord, it prescribes a reduction of the area currently under the BTC,” said Sansuma Khunggur Bwiswmuthiary, former MP and president of the new group.

The accord has a provision for excluding from the BTR villages with more than 50% non-Bodos and including villages with more than 50% Bodo people left out of the BTC map after the 2003 accord.

The Bodoland statehood movement has its roots in the 1967 Udayachal stir seeking self-rule for the areas dominated by the Bodo community. A stronger statehood movement was revived in 1987 with the slogan of ‘Divide Assam 50:50’ and it ran parallel with an armed uprising by extremists.

First Bodo Accord

The movement was doused temporarily with the signing of the first Bodo Accord in February 1993 between the government and moderate leaders of the movement, including those of the All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU). This resulted in the creation of the Bodoland Autonomous Council (BAC).

The extremist National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB), which split into four factions later on, rejected this “trivial” accord. The discontent bred another outfit, the Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT), which rivalled the NDFB.

The Centre signed the second Bodo peace accord with the BLT in February 2003, elevating the BAC to the BTC. The outfit was disbanded and most of its leaders formed the Bodoland People’s Front that ruled the BTC for several terms until the council was dissolved on April 27.

The third Bodo accord signed on January 27 among the Centre, the Assam government and Bodo organisations, including leaders of all the NDFB factions and the ABSU, envisaged to upgrade the BTC to the BTR. The Bodo signatories had then said that the accord negated the need for another statehood movement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/new-group-to-revive-bodoland-statehood-stir/article32871458.ece

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a charge sheet against Sanjay Pratap Singh and others belonging to a liquor mafia in connection with a hooch tragedy which had claimed 21 lives in Bihar.

The agency has also sought confiscation of assets worth ₹1.32 crore, belonging to the main accused, his wife, Kiran Devi, and associate, Srikumar Singh.

The attached properties include 15 plots along with constructions on two of the plots and the cash balance in the bank accounts of the accused and his unregistered firm, Maa Construction.

The ED probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act is based on a case registered by the Bihar Police in December 2012. The police had filed its charge sheet in February 2013.

It was alleged that the victims had consumed the spurious country liquor manufactured and sold by the accused and his associates.

A Bihar court later held 14 persons, including Sanjay Pratap Singh, guilty and sentenced them to life imprisonment.

The body of an 18-year-old girl, who was raped and killed, was found in a paddy field at Satrikh area in Barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh late on Wednesday, police said on Friday. One person has been arrested.

On the basis of digital evidence and ground information, accused Dinesh Gautam (19) was arrested, said Additional SP Ram Sewak Gautam.

The accused, belonging to a hamlet in the same gram sabha as the victim, confessed to committing the crime, the police officer said. The facts revealed by him during interrogation were being authenticated.

Police initially registered a murder case but after the post-mortem report confirmed rape, charges under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code were included in the FIR, he said. POCSO Act was included in the FIR after it was proven through some documents that the victim was under 18, said ASP Gautam.

The girl had gone out and her father found the body in a field when he went in search of her after she failed to return.

In the police complaint lodged against unknown accused, he said someone had strangulated his daughter

‘Hands and feet tied’

A family member told a television channel that she was naked and her hands and feet were tied.

The victim’s father, a Dalit labourer, demanded punishment for the guilty and that the family be provided a pucca house. “We want the real murderers to be arrested but our family and villagers should not be unnecessarily harassed [by the police under the pretext of questioning],” he told a media channel.

The Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Thursday attached property worth crores of rupees of former Jammu Municipal Corporation (JMC) commissioner Kuldeep Khajuria and arrested an ex-manager of the J&K Forest Corporation in separate cases of disproportionate assets, officials said.

A case was registered against Parvaiz Ahmad Bakshi, the then block manager in J&K Forest Corporation, for accumulation of huge immovable properties, they said.

The searches were conducted simultaneously in Srinagar and Jammu by the teams of ACB, they said.

During searches, various incriminating documents were recovered leading to several properties of the accused.

The lifestyle of the accused officer was also found quite lavish and incommensurate with his status as a public servant and income thereof, they said, adding that he was arrested by the ACB.

Nine kanals of land at Pattan, Baramulla worth ₹87 Lakh and 7 Marlas plot with structure costing ₹20 lakh was attached by the Anti Corruption Bureau.

In another case, Kuldeep Khajuria, former commissioner of JMC, was accused of acquiring huge properties and assets both movable and immovable worth crores of rupees in his name and in the name of his family members, the officials added.

The assets and properties were raised by him during his service period by allegedly resorting to illegal and corrupt practices, they said.

243,2020/10/16,"Gunjan Saxena film: govt., IAF for deletion of scenes","The Centre and Indian Air Force (IAF) on Thursday insisted on deletion of certain scenes from the Netflix film Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl, saying that the disclaimer at the beginning of the film was just an “eyewash”.

“Disclaimer cannot annihilate the visual depiction...A particular officer of the IAF who was very upright and never had any misogynist attitude, he has been shown as a virtual villain in the film,” Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain said.

“Also there is a scene where an arm wrestling is happening between a male officer and Ms. Saxena. These incidents never happened, and the affidavit of Ms. Saxena support this,” Mr. Jain said.

“If what you are showing in a so called biopic is something which is distorting the image of the IAF, then the disclaimer is not going to dilute it,” Mr. Jain said, adding, “They [filmmakers] don’t get artistic licence to defame a living organisation of national importance”.

To this submission, Justice Rajiv Shakdher said, “Sometimes you must think beyond the particular matter. Because perception of people and artist may vary. It’s a thought which they want to put on celluloid, canvas, books. You may or may not agree with that”.

“Don’t try and put it in a box. They may be wrong completely. But it is a view if they feel there is gender bias in the organization. Today it could be the Air Force, or bureaucracy, tomorrow it could be the judiciary,” Justice Shakdher remarked.

“Even in our profession there is talk of gender bias in the courts. People say there are not enough women on the bench or there are not enough lady senior advocate,” Justice Shakdher added.

The court while posting the hearing in the case for January 18 declined Mr. Jain’s plea to stop the theatre release of the film. “People have seen this movie on OTT [over-the-top] platform,” the court said.

Responding to the allegations that the movie depicted the Air Force in a bad light, Ms. Saxena in an affidavit said, “The deponent [Ms. Saxena] does not claim that everything that is shown in the movie has happened with her in her real life”.

“However, the Deponent believe that the message sought to be conveyed through the Movie is to motivate young women to join the IAF,” Ms. Saxena said.

She said that as per the agreement, she had no role in deciding or finalising the story, script, screenplay or dialogues in the Movie. “The deponent firmly believes that IAF as an institution is very progressive and will forever remain grateful for the opportunities given to her by the IAF,” she added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gunjan-saxena-film-govt-iaf-for-deletion-of-scenes/article32866432.ece
244,2020/10/16,"‘Merely because triple talaq is void, doesn’t mean it can’t be criminalised’","The Delhi High Court has sought response from the Centre on a plea seeking to declare the provision penalising a Muslim husband for pronouncing ‘triple talaq’ upon his wife as unconstitutional.

The High Court’s order came on a petition which argued that since the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, has declared the practice of ‘triple talaq’, to be void and illegal, there is no justification for criminalising pronouncement of ‘triple talaq’.

Section 4 of the Act provides that any Muslim husband who pronounces ‘triple talaq’ upon his wife shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years. A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar, however, said, “Prima facie it appears to us that the object of Section 4 of the aforesaid Act is to discourage the age-old and traditional practice of pronouncement of talaq by a Muslim husband upon his wife by resort to talaq-e-biddat i.e. triple talaq”.

“The purpose of Section 4 appears to be to provide a deterrent against such practice. Merely because triple talaq has been declared to be void and illegal, it does not mean that the legislature could not have made the continuation of such practice an offence. This is our prima facie view,” the Bench said.

The court also declined to grant any of the interim relief sought by Nadeem Khan, including to stay all FIRs registered under Section 4 of the 2019 Act in police stations within the territory of Delhi pending the consideration of his petition.

Mr. Khan had also sought a direction to the Commissioner of Police to restrain him from registering FIRs alleging the commission of offence under Section 4 of the Act during the pendency of the petition.

It was his contention that once triple talaq has been rendered void and illegal, there is no justification for criminalising pronouncement of triple talaq, since such triple talaq would have no legal effect on the status of the Muslim marriage.

“Since it is of no consequence, and does not end marital status of the wife — who may be subjected to triple talaq, there is no purpose of penalising under the said Act,” he argued.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/merely-because-triple-talaq-is-void-doesnt-mean-it-cant-be-criminalised/article32866385.ece

246,2020/10/16,Farm fires not key factor in Delhi pollution spike: officials,"Contribution from Punjab minimal, says State official

As the air quality in the national capital has started to worsen over the past few days and stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana is being blamed as one of the reasons behind it, experts and officials in Punjab have dismissed it as a key factor.

As per the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), the average air quality index (AQI) in Punjab has been 120 from September 21 till October 14, 2020, while the AQI in Delhi has been 179 for the same period. The stubble burning cases in Punjab started around September 21.

PPCB member secretary Kurnesh Garg said that AQI levels in Punjab during this period had largely remained within ‘moderate’ level whereas in Delhi the AQI has slipped into ‘very poor’ category.

“Contribution of stubble burning from Punjab is minimal to Delhi’s air pollution. The ambient air quality of Delhi remains poor or very poor even in December, January and February even though there’s no stubble burning during that period. The major factor of air pollution in Delhi is inherent to the anthropogenic, vehicular, solid waste burning and industrial activity within the NCR. Even active farms fires in the NCR are significantly responsible for deteriorating the Delhi environment than Punjab,” he said.

As paddy (rice) harvesting has gathered momentum in Punjab, as many as 3,517 cases of stubble fire incidents have been reported between September 21 and October 14.

A joint study by the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali, and PPCB in 2018 — “Impact of Aerosol from Paddy Residue Burning on New Delhi-NCR” —had concluded that a significant fraction of Delhi’s air pollution problems are located within the NCR or in Uttar Pradesh. And it is the dominant reason for the poor air quality persisting throughout the winter instead of improving in December onwards as it does in Punjab relative to the paddy burning season.

The hypothesis of stubble fires being responsible for most of the PM enhancements in Delhi does not hold, the study points out.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/njj2ag/article32866336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16PG4SCOLPTI13-10-2020000139A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/farm-fires-not-key-factor-in-delhi-pollution-spike/article32866337.ece
247,2020/10/16,Calcutta HC seeks response from West Bengal government on Durga Puja dole,"The Calcutta High Court on Thursday sought to know from the West Bengal government reasons for allocating ₹50,000 to thousands of puja committees for organising Durga Puja in the State. A Division Bench of Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Arijit Banerjee also enquired whether the State government has given similar financial aid for other festivals like Eid.

The court was hearing a petition filed by Sourav Dutta, a Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) leader, challenging relaxations for the puja committees and the ₹50,000 each aid to the 37,000 Durga Puja clubs in the State.

The court also sought to know whether the State has laid down guideline for such expenditure. The State government replied that the grant was meant for raising public awareness on COVID-19 control, purchase of sanitisers and masks. The matter will be heard again on Friday. The Calcutta High Court will also hear another petition demanding deferment of Durga Puja celebrations in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2018 Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had announced ₹10,000 for Durga Puja clubs, which was increased to ₹25,000 in 2019 and ₹50,000 in 2020. This was challenged in Calcutta High Court in 2018 which had refused to intervene in the matter.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee continued her spree of virtual inauguration of Durga Pujas during the day. Education Minister Partha Chatterjee said the government and the Durga Puja clubs are sensitive about the pandemic and have taken adequate steps to ensure that the celebration should not lead to spread of COVID-19 infection.

249,2020/10/16,The exhibition ‘Broken Foot’ documented the migrant workers’ crisis amid a network of inequalities,"The online exhibition, which concluded on October 10, created a unifying architecture with the Constitution as its keystone to address manifold inequalities

Inked into a confined space, the inmates are restless. One seems to be on the verge of trying to pace about; another, sharp-featured and masked, sits cross-legged and glares at the artist. Others loom in the background — are those shadows on the wall or men crumbling into bones, with cracked skulls and skull-textured masks? And yet, all these are distinct figures still, human beings full of individuality and nervous energy. This is no longer the case when we pass on to the second half of Umesh Singh’s remarkable diptych, Escapade — a Journey with the Migrants. By this time they’ve dissolved into an undifferentiated mass of huddled humanity. The walls have narrowed, and shadows lean against them with an air of desperation.

Singh, who endured an arduous two months of isolation in Varanasi during the lockdown, and was then stuffed into a series of crowded buses to return to Bihar, decided to document the experiences of his fellow travellers, a group of migrant labourers and poor students, through his art. “The bus had only 30 seats, but there were 50 people. There would be two-three people under one blanket,” he recalls. The claustrophobia and eventual dehumanisation — dehumanisation in the eyes of, and by, an indifferent state — in stark black ink evoke thoughts of the infamous Black Hole incident of Calcutta or Chittaprosad’s depictions of the Bengal Famine.

Interrelated contours

‘Spontaneous solidarities’, as epitomised in Singh’s works, was one of the thematic clusters of the exhibition ‘Broken Foot — Unfolding Inequalities,’ which ran online for three months before concluding on October 10. Driven by a need to respond to the unfolding migrant labour crisis, when an estimated one crore people tried to reach home on foot between March and June, curators Prabhakar Kamble and Rumi Samadhan reached out to 60 artists and built a thematic framework with labour at its heart. The works went up for sale on the Mojarto platform with proceeds going to artists in need.

The curatorial vision was developed along a number of interrelated contours, including the Constitution, with its idea of ‘we, the people’ and the various promises of equality; the contributions of B.R. Ambedkar to the labour movement; labour and urbanisation; migration; forms of labour; the plight of farmers; the relation between land, people and ecological issues, which ties in with tribal people and their traditions; and the notion of education as emancipation.

Don’t see

The eponymous work, Broken Foot, a sculpture in wood by curator Kamble, can be compared with Balaji Ponna’s painting, Walking Under the Empty Sky, in which a cracked slipper bestrides the outline of India as innumerable souls with glowing eyes stare accusingly. Both point to the rupture caused by the great migration, a tear in the social fabric born of blindness and betrayal. One of the exhibition’s major themes was the relationship between labour and the nation, and as we too often forget, a nation is nothing but an abstraction of a people. It is the nation that has been ruptured.

Photojournalist T. Narayan captured these lockdown journeys in his own way. One striking image, taken from behind, shows a child almost fused to his father’s neck and shoulders, as if they are one entity. Venkat Shyam’s painting, The Journey, similarly depicts a mother, looking almost like an Egyptian goddess with a pot for a crown, taking her son by the hand and walking barefoot, even as a train and an aeroplane cruise past. It’s hard not to think of the very different treatments the government meted out to returning NRIs and home-bound labourers.

T. Narayan’s photograph ‘Migrant-2’ | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

An Ambedkarite gaze on society is prominent in many of the works, and perhaps its baldest expression is in Vikrant Bhise’s painting, Ambedkar and a Labourer. A worker cleaning a statue of Ambedkar covers the latter’s eyes — perhaps urging him not to gaze, shielding him from egregious reality. Arun Vijai Mathavan’s photographs of Dalit sanitation workers and mortuary technicians during the lockdown, and the extreme conditions and prejudice they face — heightened at a time of enforced social isolation — are also striking.

Uncanny timing

Gopal Gangawane’s painting Thinker is indeed Rodin’s Thinker, but sitting on a glass-cube pedestal, he towers above three emaciated children gazing longingly at a roti hanging inside the cube. Does his philosophical, perhaps sympathetic, gaze help them in any way? Will they ever be able to think abstractly if all they can afford to think about is their next meal? Another familiar image — the pietà, Mary cradling the body of Christ — is repurposed in the ink painting, Mothers Arms are More Comfortable, by Khandakar Ohida. A body with red flesh, blood and burns, held in a woman’s arms reminds us of the quotidian violence faced by the subaltern.

Intersectionality was at play everywhere, as the exhibition looked at inequalities in different dimensions. Siddhi Jadhav’s photographs offered a peek into the life of a hijra, while Tejaswini Sonawane’s etching, Arriving Home, depicted, grotesquely, the contradictions between modernity and tradition as a grimacing woman-owl, striving to take flight, remains grounded under the gaze of society’s beady eyes.

Such thematic expansiveness meant that Broken Foot wasn’t purely focused on the plight of migrant labourers, but created an unifying architecture that took the Constitution as its keystone. Its invocation of fundamental rights and the now-totemic preamble took one back to the anti-CAA protests while the work of artists like Randeep Maddoke and Kuldip Karegaonkar depicting the lives and deaths of farmers was uncannily timely. The documentary value of recording through art the tragedy of migrant workers during the lockdown, one of the greatest yet most muted crises in our recent history, is this project’s most important achievement.

252,2020/10/16,Onion price soars in wholesale market,"The drop in arrival of onion led to price soaring to ₹80-a-kg at the Nethaji Daily Vegetable and Fruit Market here on Friday.

At the wholesale market, the price of small onions was ₹80-a-kg, while the price of big onion was ₹60-a-kg.

Traders said that big onion arrives from Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh while the small onion arrives from Bellary in Karnataka and also from nearby districts.

They said that due to heavy rainfall in onion-cultivating States, production had dropped which led to the increase in price of onion. Usually, 80 tonnes of big onion and 50 tonnes of small onion arrive at the market every day. “But now, only one-third of onions are arriving and that led to price rise”, Mani Anand, a wholesale dealer said.

Traders said that the price of onion will go up in the coming weeks as the arrival is expected to drop further. In December last year, the price of big onion touched ₹200-a-kg, while the price of small onion was ₹110-a-kg. “Price may go up, but not to the previous level”, he added.

Consumers said that the price of vegetables, including onions, had gone up in the past one month and fear that the upward price trend will continue as monsoon is expected to set in the last week of October.

During rainy season, the price of onion and vegetables will go up. “The government should take necessary action to check hoarding and also ensure that consumers are not affected due to steep increase in prices”, said P. Sheela, a home-maker from Sampath Nagar. The retail price of onion is around ₹90 and it may cross ₹100 in a few days, she added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/onion-price-soars-in-wholesale-market/article32876639.ece
253,2020/10/16,Black flag protest demanding steps to reduce traffic congestion,"Stating that traffic congestion on Nachiappa Road is affecting their business, traders and shopkeepers urged the district administration and the district police to take steps to reduce congestion and hoisted black flags in their shops here on Friday.

The stretch from GH Roundabout to Swastik Corner is one of the busiest stretches in the city with the presence of Corporation central bus stand and commercial establishments on both sides of the road.

In May, the district police introduced one-way traffic system on the stretch by allowing vehicles to move from GH Roundabout to Swastik Corner whereas vehicles in other directions were diverted through Nachiappa Road to reach Meenatchi Sundaranar Road. This resulted in one stretch of Mettur Road lying idle while the entire stretch of Nachiappa Road witnessed frequent traffic congestion throughout the day.

Two-wheeler workshops, commercial establishments, vegetables market, eateries and other shops were present on Nachiappa Road. Due to continuous movement of vehicles on the road, shopkeepers said that their business was affected and wanted the congestion to be reduced by reintroducing two-way traffic on Mettur Road. They had also submitted a petition to the district police. Also, traders on Mettur Road were demanding two-way traffic on the road as their business was affected.

On October 12, Collector C. Kathiravan along with Superintendent of Police P. Thangadurai and Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan inspected Mettur Road and held discussions on reintroducing two-way traffic. However, no decision was taken. Hence, traders and shopkeepers on Nachiappa Road wanted traffic congestion in the stretch to be reduced and hoisted black flags at their shops.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/black-flag-protest-demanding-steps-to-reduce-traffic-congestion/article32876627.ece
254,2020/10/16,Indian Premier League | We are not panicking: Archer,"Rajasthan Royals may have blown more cold than hot this season, but Jofra Archer has been red hot with the ball, right through.

He has 12 wickets, second in the bowling chart, behind Delhi Capitals' Kagiso Rabada.

Royals will need him to come up with another fine show in Saturday's match against Royal Challengers Bangalore at Dubai. Archer said: “We’ve been in this situation before and have come back from this, so we’re not panicking.”

He added that the team had to do well collectively. “I think there are wins out there and we just, as a team, need to go out there and get them,” he said.

Left-arm seamer Jaydev Unadkat Royals said Royals still had a chance to make it to the playoffs. “The table is still very open and the team which has momentum on their side in this crunch phase will qualify,” he said. “We know where we’re lacking and will do everything in our power to correct those errors and hopefully win matches now going forward.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/prn6wa/article32876186.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17ARCHER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-we-are-not-panicking-archer/article32876187.ece

256,2020/10/16,Indian Premier League 2020 | Pooran hails Gayle as greatest T20 batsman,"‘Team is confident when he’s in the middle’

Chris Gayle’s presence in the middle had the team brimming with confidence and the ‘Universe Boss” with a cracking half-century proved his worth during Kings XI Punjab’s win over Royal Challengers Bangalore, said batsman Nicholas Pooran.

Gayle, who was playing his first competitive match since January, overcame a sluggish start to smash five sixes and a boundary in his 53-run knock, helping KXIP snap a five-match losing streak.

“He started slowly, which is acceptable because he hasn’t played cricket in a long while. He has shown once more why he is the greatest T20 batsman. It’s wonderful to see him get runs,” Pooran told teammate Mayank Agarwal during a post-match show for IPLT20.com.

Mood is upbeat

The West Indies wicketkeeper-batsman added that when the 41-year-old Jamaican is out in the middle, the mood in the camp is different.

“To me, he is the greatest T20 player. When Chris is batting, you always feel you have a chance of winning the game. Once he is there, it’s a different mood in the camp. We, as batsmen, would want someone like him in the middle,” Pooran said.

In the first match of the tournament against Delhi Capitals, KXIP had failed to score the required one run from the last three balls and the game went to a Super Over where Kings XI lost the game. On Thursday, K.L. Rahul and his men needed just seven off the final two overs with nine wickets in hand but somehow took the game to the last ball.

With big-hitter Gayle departing off the penultimate ball, Pooran walked in to hit the winning six.

Deja vu

“When the last over started, it was like deja vu. Last three balls, one run it was like the Delhi game all over again but just the difference is that I was in the dugout,” Pooran said.

“A million things were running in my mind, I was not clear, to be honest, what I was gonna (sic) do. I never wanted to be in that position. After sitting out for so long, I have to bat the last ball and 11 fielders looked like 20. Two points is the most important thing for us,” Pooran added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/uebpde/article32876140.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17GAYLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-pooran-hails-gayle-as-greatest-t20-batsman/article32876141.ece
257,2020/10/16,BCCI apex council to discuss home season,"There is no clarity on whether competitive cricket can resume anytime soon

The fate of the home season, including England’s scheduled tour of India early next year and the deferred domestic calendar, is set to be discussed during the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s apex council meeting on Saturday.

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, competitive cricket in India has virtually come to a standstill. As a result, despite the Indian Premier League (IPL) being played in the United Arab Emirates, there is no clarity on whether competitive cricket can resume in India anytime soon.

ECB’s apprehension

The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has thus expressed apprehension over travelling to India and has instead sent the BCCI a feeler preferring to play the series in the UAE. A section within the apex council is understood to be in favour of creating a bio-bubble either in Mumbai, Ahmedabad or Dharamsala for the England series. But there are sceptics about domestic cricket, with a whopping 38 teams participating in senior and junior cricket now.

“To assure ECB about safety of cricketers in India, scheduling domestic cricket is paramount but to create bubbles in four or five cities is the big risk, so it’s a tricky call,” said a BCCI insider.

Call on kit sponsor

It remains to be seen if the apex council takes a call on the kit sponsor for India’s tour to Australia. With Nike’s term having expired, the recent tenders floated by the BCCI didn’t receive any response due to uncertainty over resumption of international cricket.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/6kh3ym/article32189478.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BCCI-Logo-jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bcci-apex-council-to-discuss-home-season/article32876123.ece
258,2020/10/16,"Indian Premier League 2020 | MI juggernaut rolls on, crushes KKR to reclaim top spot","Chahar, Bumrah star with the ball before de Kock settles the contest with an unbeaten 44-ball 78; Cummins’ defiant fifty not enough for Kolkata

In a lopsided contest, Kolkata Knight Riders succumbed to Mumbai Indians at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Friday.

MI thrashed KKR by eight wickets inside 17 overs to move to the top of the table, even on points with Delhi Capitals but ahead on net run rate after eight games.

Signature shot

Chasing a target of 149, Quinton de Kock (78 not out, 44b, 9x4, 3x6) snatched the game away in a flash.

The South African executed classical cricketing shots, including his signature hook, to keep the scoreboard ticking. He found solid support in Rohit (35, 36b, 5x4, 1x6) and the partnership helped MI race to 51 without loss in the PowerPlay.

By the time Shivam Mavi dismissed Rohit, Mumbai only needed 55 off 57 balls.

Although Suryakumar Yadav did not get going, Hardik Pandya, promoted to No. 4, hastened the end with an 11-ball 21 not out (3x4, 1x6).

Disciplined effort

MI’s disciplined bowling effort had earlier restricted the Knight Riders to 148 for five.

KKR started cautiously before Suryakumar’s quick reflexes in the point region, which helped him pouch Rahul Tripathi off Trent Boult, set things rolling for the defending champion.

Nathan Coulter-Nile scalped Nitish Rana to finish the PowerPlay on a high.

It set the stage for leg-spinner Rahul Chahar, who called the shots in the middle overs by removing Shubman Gill and Dinesh Karthik, who had handed over the captaincy to Eoin Morgan in a bid to bat more freely. Gill and Karthik were dismissed off successive deliveries.

Bumrah nails Russell

Jasprit Bumrah then got the dangerous Andre Russell with a well-directed short ball to further hurt KKR’s chances.

Pat Cummins, who had smashed a 12-ball 33 against MI earlier this season, refused to give up the ghost, finishing with 53 not out (36b, 5x4, 2x6).

He added 87 runs off 57 balls for the sixth wicket with Morgan to save his side’s blushes.

But de Kock’s early assault quickly ended any hopes KKR may have had of making a match of it.

Scoreboard:

Kolkata Knight Riders: Rahul Tripathi c Suryakumar b Boult 7 (9b, 1x4), Shubman Gill c Pollard b Rahul Chahar 21 (23b, 2x4), Nitish Rana c de Kock b Coulter-Nile 5 (6b, 1x4), Dinesh Karthik b Rahul Chahar 4 (8b, 1x4), Eoin Morgan (not out) 39 (29b, 2x4, 2x6), Andre Russell c de Kock b Bumrah 12 (9b, 1x4, 1x6), Pat Cummins (not out) 53 (36b, 5x4, 2x6); Extras (lb-2, w-5): 7; Total (for five wkts. in 20 overs): 148.

Dinesh Karthik has informed the KKR management that with a view to focusing on his batting and contributing more to the team’s cause, he wished to hand over the reins to Eoin Morgan, according to a KKR statement on Friday.

KKR CEO Venky Mysore said Karthik’s decision had come as a surprise. The team was “fortunate that Eoin Morgan, the 2019 World Cup-winning (England) captain, who has been the vice-captain, is willing to lead the side going forward,” he said.

260,2020/10/16,IPL 2020 | Rejuvenated CSK brace up for Delhi Capitals challenge,"Every tactic that CSK captain Dhoni employed against Sunrisers Hyderabad worked, and they are expected to continue in the same vein as they battle to salvage the season.

Their campaign is back on track, courtesy Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s smart captaincy, but a stiff test awaits Chennai Super Kings when they face a dominant Delhi Capitals in their next IPL match here on Saturday.

Every tactic that Dhoni employed against Sunrisers Hyderabad worked, and they are expected to continue in the same vein as they battle to salvage the season. Whether it was promoting Sam Curran to the opener’s slot or finishing pacer Deepak Chahar’s quota upfront while using seven bowlers to dry up runs, every move produced desired result.

Dhoni used leg spinner Piyush Chawla for only one over and that too as late as in the 16th over, leaving it largely on Ravindra Jadeja and Karn Sharma but CSK are likely to continue with three spinners considering that the Sharjah wickets are now getting slower.

That spinners hold the key in Sharjah was evident in the last two games where RCB and Kings XI Punjab slow bowlers were instrumental in their respective team’s wins.

The three-time champions will look to build on the win over SRH as the league phase moves towards the business end.

However, they are up against a team which is high on confidence and well-served by the South African pace duo of Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje, who bowled a 156.2 kmph delivery during his spell against Rajasthan Royals.

Add the wily R. Ashwin and Axar Patel to the mix and DC has a rather impressive bowling unit.

Pacer Tushar Deshpande, who made a memorable debut in the win over the Royals on Wednesday, adds teeth to the attack and the focus will be on how he follows up that performance.

The Capitals side would be a little worried about the fitness status of Shreyas Iyer, who hurt his left shoulder in the previous game. The skipper has been in good form with the bat and has led well too.

If he is ruled out of tomorrow’s match, DC will be deprived of his classy batting and calm leadership, which would be a blow for a side already missing the services of Rishab Pant, sidelined by hamstring issues.

The team will also be expecting the talented Prithvi Shaw to show consistency while the senior pro Shikhar Dhawan has weighed in with crucial runs at the top as has Marcus Stoinis.

Squads:

Chennai Super Kings: MS Dhoni (C), M Vijay, Ambati Rayudu, Faf du Plessis, Shane Watson, Kedar Jadhav, Dwayne Bravo, Ravindra Jadeja, Lungi Ngidi, Deepak Chahar, Piyush Chawla, Imran Tahir, Mitchell Santner, Josh Hazlewood, Shardul Thakur, Sam Curran, N Jagadeesan, KM Asif, Monu Kumar, R Sai Kishore, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Karn Sharma.

Delhi Capitals: Shreyas Iyer (C), Ravichandran Ashwin, Shikhar Dhawan, Prithvi Shaw, Shimron Hetmyer, Kagiso Rabada, Ajinkya Rahane, Amit Mishra, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ishant Sharma, Axar Patel, Sandeep Lamichhane, Keemo Paul, Daniel Sams, Mohit Sharma, Anrich Nortje, Alex Carey (wk), Avesh Khan, Tushar Deshpande, Harshal Patel, Marcus Stoinis, Lalit Yadav.

261,2020/10/16,IPL 2020 | RCB looks to get tactics right as they face Rajasthan Royals,"Rajasthan Royals’ campaign this season has been marred by numerous top-order collapses, forcing the lower half to pull them across the finish line.

Royal Challengers Bangalore would aim to get their strategy right after some inexplicable decisions during the loss to Kings XI Punjab when they take on an erratic Rajasthan Royals in an IPL match in Dubai on Saturday.

The Virat Kohli-led RCB has won five of its eight games on the back of all-round performances but seemingly blundered in the eight-wicket defeat to laggards KXIP on Thursday.

On the other hand, the Royals’ campaign this season has been marred by numerous top-order collapses, forcing the lower half to pull them across the finish line.

RCB’s five wins so far include a Super Over triumph over Mumbai Indians at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

The Royals, on the other hand, lie at the seventh spot in the points table with just three wins from eight outings.

Against KXIP in Sharjah, AB De Villiers, who has been in fine form, was sent in to bat at number six with left-hander Washington Sundar (13), a baffling decision by the RCB.

Shivam Dube, 23, was promoted up the order to accompany skipper Kohli in the middle.

The experiment didn’t work as all three batsmen struggled with the South African scoring just two off five balls.

To add to RCB’s woes, while defending the total, Kohli decided to save the in-form Sundar for the big-hitting Chris Gayle, who came to bat in the eighth over. That gamble didn’t pay off either as the 41-year-old Jamaican smashed the young off-spinner for four sixes.

“We had a chat, a message from outside about left-right combination and we wanted to go with it because they had two leggies. Sometimes things don’t come off. We’re pretty happy with the decisions we took, but it didn’t come off,” Kohli said after the match.

However, Kohli and his men will look to shrug off the defeat.

Meanwhile, the Royals boast of a strong batting line-up. But the likes of Steve Smith, and Sanju Samson have failed to score since the two victories in Sharjah at the beginning of the tournament.

Jos Buttler too has been unable to capitalise on his starts, scoring just one half-century in seven innings.

After failing in his first match of the season, Ben Stokes, who has been elevated to the role of an opener, hit 41 before he was run out against the Delhi Capitals.

The inaugural season champions have relied on Rahul Tewatia to rescue them from precarious positions and the all-rounder managed to do that twice against KXIP and Sunrisers Hyderabad respectively. But he failed against the Capitals when yet again the top-order botched an easy run-chase.

Jofra Archer spearheads the Rajasthan bowling unit, along with the spin duo of Tewatia and Shreyas Gopal, who have consistently figured in an XI that has gone through a lot of chopping and changing.

Squads:

RCB: Virat Kohli (c), AB de Villiers, Parthiv Patel (wk), Aaron Finch, Josh Philippe, Chris Morris, Moeen Ali, Mohammed Siraj, Shahbaz Ahmed, Devdutt Padikkal, Yuzvendra Chahal, Navdeep Saini, Dale Steyn, Pawan Negi, Isuru Udana, Shivam Dube, Umesh Yadav, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Washington Sundar, Pavan Deshpande, Adam Zampa.

Rajasthan Royals: Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes, Sanju Samson, Andrew Tye, Kartik Tyagi, Steven Smith (c), Ankit Rajpoot, Shreyas Gopal, Rahul Tewatia, Jaydev Unadkat, Mayank Markande, Mahipal Lomror, Oshane Thomas, Riyan Parag, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Anuj Rawat, Akash Singh, David Miller, Manan Vohra, Shashank Singh, Varun Aaron, Tom Curran, Robin Uthappa, Aniruddha Joshi, Jofra Archer.

262,2020/10/16,Took cue from RCB bowlers by observing them: Murugan Ashwin,"The leg-spinner dismissed the dangerous pair of Aaron Finch and Washington Sundar, giving away only 23 runs in his four-over quota, a performance that played a significant role in Kings XI Punjab’s much-needed 8-wicket win over RCB on Thursday.

Kings XI Punjab leg-spinner Murugan Ashwin has credited the lessons learnt from observing Royal Challengers Bangalore tweakers for his fine economical performance against the same side in an IPL clash here.

Ashwin dismissed the dangerous pair of Aaron Finch and Washington Sundar, giving away only 23 runs in his four-over quota, a performance that played a significant role in Kings XI Punjab’s much-needed eight-wicket victory over RCB on Thursday.

The 30-year-old leg-spinner said watching Yuzvendra Chahal and Sundar bowl during RCB’s thumping 82-run win over KKR the other day helped him find the right length at the same small Sharjah ground.

“The wicket was holding up a bit. It was about executing length. It did have something for spinners. I was watching the ball previous game which RCB played. How their spinners bowled. I took a cue from that,” Ashwin said at the post-match press conference.

“I wanted to hit the right length and try to turn it as much as possible, turn it both ways.”

Chahal had conceded only 12 runs in his four overs with one wicket while Sundar dismissed two batsmen and gave away only 20 runs in his quota of overs in the clash against KKR.

Ashwin said bowling on a ground that has small boundaries is challenging.

“It’s a challenge and you have to accept it. You need to adapt and that’s what we do in practice. If we can overcome that, that’s the right way forward,” he said.

“This is a game of T20, all are close games. It’s about who gets the better. It’s about replicating these moments and keep adding to the points table.”

West Indian marauder Chris Gayle made a swashbuckling entry to the Punjab side by playing a six-laden 53-run knock and Ashwin said that the ‘Universe Boss’ adds to the energy in the team.

“Chris coming back, gives a lot of energy to the side. We did not lose spirit even when we were losing. We were playing good cricket and it’s just about getting over the line.”

“We will take each game at a time. Make sure you cross the line and execute what you practice.”

RCB all-rounder Chris Morris, like his skipper Virat Kohli, was asked about the move to send AB De Villiers down the order. He also justified the move, saying it was done to counter the leg-spinners.

“It’s difficult to keep consistent line to a right-left combination. The wicket was getting slow towards the end. We did think we had enough runs but may be we leaked boundaries, maybe the gameplan got slightly wrong but it went to the last over last ball, the boys stuck,” he said.

Asked if the middle overs, when the boundaries dried up for them, cost them since they did not force the pace, Morris said, “It’s easy to say it now (to force pace in middle overs). We had enough runs, we should have defended that.”

He was also effusive in his praise for Gayle.

“He’s got a lot of experience. He is a class player, got those records for a reason. All batters played well,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/crxiaz/article32869018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDMURUGANASHWIN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/took-cue-from-rcb-bowlers-by-observing-them-murugan-ashwin/article32869019.ece
263,2020/10/16,Pakistan invites England for three-match T20 series in Jan 2021,"England has not played in Pakistan since the 2005-06 season when the team toured for a test and one-day series.

The Pakistan Cricket Board has invited England for a three-match T20 International series in January next year, PCB CEO Wasim Khan has revealed.

England has not played in Pakistan since the 2005-06 season when the team toured for a test and one-day series.

“Yes, we have now sent an official invitation to the ECB inviting them to send their team and have also created a window between 13 and 20 January to play the three T20 series,” Mr. Khan told a Pakistani channel.

He made it clear that the short tour was not related to Pakistan touring England this summer for a test series despite the COVID-19 threat.

“When we took the decision of sending the team to England we were worried because of the COVID-19 and bio-security bubble situations and some people also voiced their concerns that (it) might be putting our players into a health risk,” Mr. Khan said.

“It wasn’t easy for us when some 10 players tested positive prior to leaving for the tour,” he recalled.

“But we sent the team because we felt that it was imperative to resume cricket activities and the resumption of world cricket depended on how well the bio-secure bubble worked in the series,” he added.

Mr. Khan said it was up to the England Cricket Board to assess the situation and take a call on the invitation.

“We never discussed a return tour at that time but now we have invited the ECB to send their team and now it is up to them to assess the security, COVID-19 situations before reaching a decision,” he said.

“We are very confident they will come and if that happens it will be great for Pakistan cricket as it will open the doors for other top teams like Australia and New Zealand to also come to Pakistan,” he added.

Pakistan has already invited Cricket South Africa to send its team in January-February next year to play two tests and a three-T20 series.

Pakistan will be hosting Zimbabwe for a white ball series in Rawalpindi and Lahore in November and Mr. Khan said it was high time that top teams came to the country.

Test teams have avoided playing in Pakistan since 2009 when terrorists attacked the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore.

But in the last two years, the ice has been broken with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh teams playing test matches and white-ball cricket last season.

264,2020/10/16,"Indian Premier League 2020, RCB vs KXIP | Decision to push AB down the order didn’t work: Virat Kohli","""We’re pretty happy with the decisions we took, but it didn’t come off,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation.

Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper Virat Kohli on October 15 admitted the decision to push AB de Villiers down the order didn’t work but said his bowlers should have been able to defend 171 against Kings XI Punjab in an IPL match in Sharjah.

De Villiers, who had smashed a 33-ball 73 against Kolkata Knight Riders in their last match, was expected to come in at his usual number four spot but with two leg-spinners in operation, left-handed batsman Washington Sundar was sent ahead of the South African.

RCB couldn’t accelerate in the death overs and if it wasn’t for the 8-ball 25 by Chris Morris in the last over, the total would have been below 160.

“We had a chat, a message from outside about left-right combination and we wanted to go with it because they had two leggies. Sometimes things don’t come off. We’re pretty happy with the decisions we took, but it didn’t come off,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation.

“Having 170 was a decent score. The idea was to let them [Shivam Dube and Sundar] to get their eye in. They bowled well. It’s not a great ground for bowlers but that’s not an excuse.

“We take pride in our bowling. Tonight it didn’t come off and we have to accept it and take responsibility. There’s always something to learn to go back and understand.”

Chasing the total, KL Rahul (61 not out) and Chris Gayle (53) went on a six-hitting spree to bring the equation down to seven in last two overs with nine wickets in hand.

But KXIP somehow managed to take the game to the last ball with Nicholas Pooran finally hitting the winning six.

“It was quite surprising, we thought the game might finish in the 18th. A bit of pressure at the back end can confuse you, anything can happen in this game,” Kohli said.

KXIP captain KL Rahul heaved a shy of relief after the win, admitting it got too close for comfort in the end.

“I don’t even have words. We knew that we had to scrap and get over the line once and that would give us the confidence. We’re a far better side than bottom of the table. Towards the end it got too close for comfort but happy that we made it.”

It was only KXIP’s second win in the tournament and Rahul admitted it has been frustrating for the team to lose some close matches.

“Our skills were very good, probably didn’t capitalise in the big moments starting with the first game at Delhi. It’s part of the IPL, it’s part of cricket. There are ups and downs and this has been the kind of rollercoaster that’s been crazy but on a positive note we needed this win.”

Rahul has been in sensational form with four fifty and a massive hundred so far in the tournament.

However, he said his personal form hasn’t been on his mind as he had to manage the team as captain.

“At the moment, my first time as captain, you kind of don’t reflect on your own performance. As a leader you need to think of everybody and how to keep the 15 or the 25 balanced and hungry to do well. That’s been the challenge so personal performances haven’t been on my mind so much.”

Rahul praised Chris Gayle, who blasted a 45-ball 53 in his first match since January.

“Chris has not been feeling well but he’s always been hungry. Anyone who saw him, he was training hard like he’s probably never done. It was a tough call to make not to play someone like that,” he said.

“I won’t take credit but it’s important to keep the lion hungry sometimes. Wherever he bats, he’s still the same player and it worked today.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/it0mti/article32867386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-KOHLI-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-rcb-vs-kxip-decision-to-push-ab-down-the-order-didnt-work-virat-kohli/article32867387.ece
265,2020/10/16,Online process behind substantial increase in admissions this year after first cut-off list: DU,"Last year, the varsity had seen nearly 24,000 admissions after the first cut-off list but this year, the number of admissions after the first cut-off list has reached over 29,000, the highest till date.

The substantial increase in the number of admissions this year after the first cut-off list is mainly because the entire process is taking place online due to the COVID-19 pandemic which has saved students the trouble of physically visiting the colleges, Delhi University officials have said.

Last year, the varsity had seen nearly 24,000 admissions after the first cut-off list but this year, the number of admissions after the first cut-off list has reached over 29,000, the highest till date.

Colleges say they have seen a substantial increase in admissions in 2020.

Shobha Bagai, Dean (Admissions), Delhi University, said the number of admissions has increased in colleges.

“Somebody sitting in Vishakhpatnam or somebody sitting in Manipur can apply online without having to phsyically visit colleges. Earlier, they would have to visit colleges for admissions but now they can apply sititing at their homes. This has led to a tremendous increase in the number of applicants,” she said.

Manoj Sinha, principal of Arybhatta College, said till last year, the college would have 100 or even less admissions after the first cut-off but this year they have admitted 180 students. This meant that the cut-offs have been realistic and students have applied to colleges under them, he said.

266,2020/10/16,North Delhi civic body to be fined ₹1 crore for no action against garbage burning: Gopal Rai,"Delhi’s air quality has been worsening gradually, but the agencies are still not taking it seriously, says Gopal Rai

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Friday issued directions for imposition of ₹1 crore fine on North Delhi Municipal Corporation for not taking action against garbage burning in Kirari village in northwest Delhi. He said regular incidents of large-scale garbage burning had been brought to his notice.

“Delhi’s air quality has been worsening gradually, but the agencies are still not taking it seriously. Environmental norms are being flouted brazenly here. Garbage burning is rampant,” Mr. Rai told reporters.

“Directions have been issued to impose a fine of ₹1 crore on North Delhi civic body for not controlling garbage burning in the area,” he said.

Pollution levels reduced slightly in the national capital on Friday with favourable wind speed helping in dispersion of pollutants, according to India Meteorological Department officials.

The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 251 at 10 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 315 on Thursday, the worst since February 12 (AQI 320).

An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/l4bkmo/article32873600.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIRPOLLUTIONGARBAGEBURN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/north-delhi-civic-body-to-be-fined-1-crore-for-no-action-against-garbage-burning-gopal-rai/article32873601.ece
267,2020/10/16,CPCB expects dip in pollution levels in Delhi,"Measures to reduce stubble burning, early harvesting key factors behind pattern

Officials at the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) have said that they are expecting a decrease in instances of stubble burning, a major contributor to Delhi’s winter pollution.

October has seen a rise in instances of stubble burning, where farmers in Punjab and Haryana burn paddy straw, compared to last year. Its contribution to the Delhi National Capital Region’s overall pollution burden has grown from 6% on Wednesday to 20% on Thursday, according to data from SAFAR, a regional weather forecast service by the Ministry of Earth Sciences.

“There has been early harvesting this year. Pollution worsens when burning combines with adverse weather and we are hoping that because of early harvesting these two don’t coincide as much when winter progresses,” said CPCB Chairman Shiv Das Meena at a press briefing on Friday.

The ventilation index, a metric that indicates how efficiently pollutants are dispersed in the atmosphere, was lower this October compared to the last, says Member-Secretary of CPCB Prashant Gargava. There were also fewer rainy days in September and October so far, compared to last year. “These factors have contributed to the spike in stubble burning related pollution this year and the expectation is that along with measures taken to discourage famers from burning and less acreage under non-basmati rice, there should hopefully be some reduction in severe pollution.”

The number of days with ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’ air quality had declined from 246 in 2016 to 183 in 2019. Last year, stubble burning — at its peak — contributed to 44% of the pollution in Delhi and on average ranged from 13-25% during October and November, the months that saw the most burning.

269,2020/10/16,"DPCC imposes ₹10,000 fine each on ten people","All of them had set farm waste on fire

The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on Thursday imposed a fine of ₹10,000 each on 10 people in Mundka for setting farm waste on fire.

FIRs were also filed against these people based on complaints by the DPCC, said authorities. Though the Delhi government blames neighbouring States for stubble burning, many farmers on the outskirts of the city set stubble on fire.

Residents of Mundka said plastic waste and other materials are still set on fire in the area by businessmen. Mundka is one of the 13 air pollution hotspots in the city.

“Action will also be initiated by SDM, Punjabi Bagh against these violators. The team also met the local farmers in Mundka village and informed them about legal consequences for burning crop residue/stubble in the future,” the DPCC said.

Also, the pollution control body said it will impose a fine of ₹20 lakh on the PWD for not following anti-pollution measures at a construction site along the main road in Burari.

“We have directed the DPCC to impose an environmental compensation penalty of ₹20 lakh on the PWD. Besides this, PWD has been directed to instal two water tankers at the site. At the same time, it is instructed to cover the ejected soil,” Environment Minister Gopal Rai said after an inspection of the area.

“The government has started an anti-dust campaign to prevent pollution from dust blowing in Delhi. Under this, the government has issued necessary guidelines and strict action will be taken on its violation. Particularly, the departments should take caution in the way the pollution crisis is increasing within the city,” the Minister added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dpcc-imposes-10000-fine-each-on-ten-people/article32866752.ece
270,2020/10/16,"BJP, AAP spar over contribution of stubble burning to city’s pollution","Farm fires contribute only 4% to Delhi’s pollution: Javadekar

A political tussle over air pollution in the Capital ensued between the Centre and the Delhi government on Sunday when Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said the stubble burning in neighbouring States contribute only 4% of Delhi’s pollution and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal retaliated by calling it a ‘denial’.

According to government-run monitoring agency System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the contribution of stubble burning to PM2.5, a chief pollutant, was only 1% in Delhi NCT on Wednesday and 6% on Thursday.

According to SAFAR officials, the contribution varies between 0 and 40%, depending on the number of farm fires and wind direction among other factors.

“As many as 50 teams from CPCB will be deployed for inspection in Delhi-NCR from today (Thursday). Stubble burning contributes only 4% of pollutants in the environment of Delhi, rest is due to local factors like dust, construction and biomass burning,” Mr. Javadekar said on Thursday.

‘Denial won’t help’

Meanwhile, Mr. Kejriwal tweeted, “Staying in denial will not help. If stubble burning causes only 4% pollution, then why has pollution suddenly increased last fortnite? Air was clean before that. Same story every yr. There’s no massive jump in any local source of pollution in last few days to cause this spike [sic]?”

Later, Mr. Javadekar said his statement has been “misinterpreted” by a section of the media. “Let me clarify, the figures of 4% share of stubble burning in AQI in Delhi, pertained to this week. It varies from 4% to 40% during peak stubble burning. At the same time, let us not be in denial that there are several local factors — vehicular pollution, non-agricultural biomass burning, dust, geographical and metrological — that are primarily responsible for high air pollution during winters in Delhi,” the Union Minister tweeted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-aap-spar-over-contribution-of-stubble-burning-to-citys-pollution/article32866751.ece
271,2020/10/16,Delhi Chief Minister launches campaign to tackle rising levels of air pollution,"Arvind Kejriwal appeals to motorists to switch off vehicles at traffic signals

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday launched an initiative — Red Light On, Gaadi Off — to tackle the problem of rising air pollution in the Capital.

Mr. Kejriwal said there are one crore vehicles registered in Delhi out of which if 10 lakh turn off their ignition at traffic signals, around 1.5 tonnes of PM10 will reduce in a year and PM 2.5 will decrease by 0.4 tonnes. The initiative has been launched under the “Yuddh, Pradushan Ke Viruddh” campaign of the government.

‘Farmers are worst hit’

“The pollution here is increasing and the situation deteriorates every year due to stubble burning in the neighboring States. With time, the number of cases of stubble burning is increasing in neighboring States. I think the toxic air becomes a bit diluted when it reaches the Capital, but the farmers who burn the stubble are the worst hit,” he said at a digital briefing.

“From today, we are launching a new initiative. Every time vehicles stop at a red signal, we have noticed that drivers do not turn the engine off. This is known as idling when the vehicle emits a lot of toxic air. In Delhi, there are around one crore registered vehicles. Even if we estimate that around 30-40% of the vehicles come out in the streets of Delhi and cause emissions, we can imagine how polluting the air can get,” he added.

Experts had calculated and informed him that the initiative could lead to a decrease in PM 10 levels by 1.5 tonnes and PM 2.5 by 0.4 tonnes, he said. The experts noted that when a car is in idling mode, it emits a lot more pollutants than when traveling.

“If the car is in idling mode for 10 seconds, it emits more pollutants than if you stop the engine and then restart it. In this way, you can also save more fuel in your car. Every day, one car spends around 15 to 20 minutes at the red signal on an average. During this time one car utilizes around 200 mL of fuel. But if you switch off the engine at the red signals, you can save ₹7,000 per month,” he added.

Mr. Kejriwal said vehicular emissions in winters stay near the surface and contribute to the air pollution.

Kejriwal to citizens

“I want every citizen of Delhi to cooperate with us to bring down the pollution levels. This is the time of pandemic and if the pollution level increases now, the situation can worsen,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hoh578/article32866805.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE15CM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-launches-campaign-to-tackle-rising-levels-of-air-pollution/article32866750.ece
272,2020/10/16,AQI slips to ‘very poor’ category in Delhi,"Gurugram and Noida too in same category; cases of stubble burning on the rise

The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram, and Noida, all part of the National Capital Region (NCR), worsened to “very poor” category on Thursday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.

This is the first time this season that Delhi’s air quality has plunged to “very poor”. It is expected to remain unchanged on Friday. As per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin on Thursday, which is the average for the past 24 hours, the air quality index (AQI) in Delhi was recorded at 312, Gurugram 311 and Noida 321.

All the values are in the “red” category and can cause “respiratory illness on prolonged exposure”, said CPCB. The AQI of all three cities were in the “poor” category on Wednesday.

An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘’good’’, 51 and 100 ‘’satisfactory’’, 101 and 200 ‘’moderate’’, 201 and 300 ‘’poor’’, 301 and 400 ‘’very poor’’, and 401 and 500 ‘’severe’’.

“AQI is likely to stay at the very poor category for tomorrow [Friday]. Marginal improvement is likely on October 17 but in the lower end of the very poor to poor category,” SAFAR said.

An increase in stubble burning fire counts was observed on Wednesday around Haryana, Punjab, and neighboring border regions and as per SAFAR, the fire counts were estimated to be 740. Also, wind direction is partly favorable for transfer of pollutants from these states to Delhi and hence an increase in the contribution of stubble burning to PM2.5, a chief pollutant, in Delhi is expected.

Also, a ban on diesel generators, except for emergency purposes, came into force in Delhi and neighbouring cities from Thursday as part of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) measures to control air pollution.

The Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA) on Thursday wrote to the Haryana government that last year an affidavit was given by the government that all colonies will be connected to power grids before the onset of winter of 2020, but it was not done. The EPCA has also asked for fresh timelines for the same in view of a ban on diesel generators in NCR cities.

The Haryana government had asked for an exemption from the ban.

Rai writes to EPCA

In a related development, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai wrote letters to the EPCA and the CPCB to close 11 power plants outside Delhi, but in the NCR region, within a week. He also urged them to not allow diesel generators in Haryana.

“It feels that the Central government has become the spokesperson of these States [where stubble burning is happening] and is competing with Delhi,” Mr. Rai said at a press meet.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/d5gbqy/article32866796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE15LEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aqi-slips-to-very-poor-category/article32866745.ece
273,2020/10/16,"Landlady calls Kashmiri student terrorist,threatens her in policeman’s presence","Tenant alleged that her house was broken into and belongings stolen

A 22-year-old student from Kashmir was allegedly called a “terrorist”, abused and threatened by the owner of her rented accommodation in south-east Delhi’s Amar Colony on Wednesday night, police said.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East) R.P. Meena said that a case has been registered on charges of house trespass, theft, house break-in, causing hurt, and intending to insult modesty of woman based on a complaint submitted by the victim identified as Noor Bhatt, who lives on the fourth floor of a house in East of Kailash.

Speaking to The Hindu, Ms. Bhatt said that she was in Kalkaji on Wednesday evening and when she returned to the house, where she has been living since June, she saw the lock broken and her belongings stolen. “My furniture, clothes and money were stolen. The whole house was turned upside down. I immediately messaged my sister and then called police,” she said.

Meanwhile, Ms. Bhatt said that the house owner Taruna Makhija came with a man and a policeman and alleged that she had stolen the furniture. “I asked him to check CCTV footage if I had taken anything. The owner couldn’t say anything to that,” she said.

Derogatory statements

Ms. Bhatt alleged that the man who had come with the woman called her a terrorist after which the owner also called her the same. “She said ‘You are a terrorist. Your father is a terrorist. You have come from Kashmir to spread terrorism’,” Ms. Bhatt said, adding that the owner also made derogatory statements pointing at her religion.

“I asked the policeman how he could allow this to happen in front of him,” she said.

Subsequently, senior officers from the police station also came after which Ms. Bhatt submitted her written complaint. “I was standing in the balcony of the house when the owner threatened me about my life. That too, in front of police personnel,” she alleged.

Bill dispute

According to Ms. Bhatt, an incident took place about a month ago when a man came to the house and claimed to be from BSES. Ms. Bhatt claimed that the man had trespassed the house and they called the police at that time as well but the matter reached a compromise. “The owner has a problem with us because we flagged the issue over our electricity bill. Our fourth floor meter was connected with the fifth floor, which we don’t use. The bill was fine for the first month but it was exorbitant for the next month because of fifth floor,” she said.

DCP Meena said: “It has also come to notice that a dispute has also taken place earlier over the payment of rent and not paying electricity bills by the tenant. The electricity was also disconnected by the BSES”.

Police said that the owner Taruna Makhija has also given a written complaint, which is being examined.

Ms. Bhatt also claimed that she has been in the Capital for the last four years and she has been subject to “subtle bullying” because of her Kashmiri identity. “I have been bullied in college. I have been denied accommodation by landlords because I am a Kashmiri. Does being a Kashmiri make me any less of an Indian?” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/landlord-calls-kashmiri-student-terroristthreatens-her-in-policemans-presence/article32866394.ece

A teenager has been apprehended for allegedly trying to appear in a Jamia Millia Islamia University entrance examination in place of another candidate, the police said on Thursday.

DCP (South-East) R.P. Meena said that a complaint was received from university official stating that the boy, who tried to appear in the entrance exam for B.Voc (Solar Energy) course on Wednesday in place of the original candidate, was wearing a mask and might have thought that the invigilator will not check.

Asked to remove mask

“He was asked to remove the mask and it was found that the photo on the admit card did not match the photo on the Aadhaar card of the candidate. The invigilator informed the superintendent who in turn informed the Controller of Examination after which the police were approached,” he said.

The police said that the minor, however, claimed that he didn’t know the whereabouts of the actual candidate.

The police said that the minor attends coaching classes in Joga Bai Extension and a month ago, he met Shahnawaj at the coaching centre and was asked to appear in the entrance exam in place of another candidate on the assurance of waiving his coaching fees.

Shahnawaj then took the boy to Sajid, the owner of the coaching class. Sajid told the boy that the real candidate was unable to come to Delhi from Jharkhand because his ticket was not confirmed.

The original admit card and Aadhaar card of the actual candidate have been recovered from the accused and a case on charges of cheating and common intention has been registered.

The city police on Thursday informed the Delhi High Court that the information about disclosure statement of a Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) student, who was arrested in a case related to the north-east Delhi communal violence, was not leaked by its officers.

DCP (Special Cell) in an affidavit stated that Delhi Police was also aggrieved by the news report in which the alleged confessional statement of JMI university student Asif Iqbal Tanha was leaked.

Justice Vibhu Bakhru, after perusing the affidavit, asked the counsel for Zee News and OpIndia to disclose the source of the statement by the next date of hearing on October 19.

Mr. Tanha, a 24-year old student, had in his plea stated that he was aggrieved by various news reports which appeared in electronic media that he has confessed to organising and inciting the communal riots.

‘Inadmissible evidence’

It was Mr. Tanha’s case that he was coerced by the police officers to sign certain papers and make statements while in their effective custody. He contends that the alleged disclosure statements, which are subject matter of news reports, were not given voluntarily and are inadmissible as evidence.

He had alleged that Delhi police officers have with the “mala fide intention of prejudicing” him in pending proceedings, leaked the statement to media. Mr. Tanha had also sought for an inquiry to be conducted into the misconduct of the police officers who are responsible for leaking the information to media agencies.

The court had, however, refused to pass any interim order directing Zee News and OpIndia and social networking platforms Facebook and YouTube to remove the content noting that it will pass necessary orders after hearing all the parties.

Ecogreen Energy Gurgaon Faridabad Private Limited, the concessionaire for implementation of Integrated Solid Waste Management project in the two cities, has been accused of entering into an agreement with a third company for door-to-door collection of waste in contravention of the concession agreement with the Haryana government.

Holding a press conference at Shama Tourist Complex here on Thursday, Panipat-based RTI activist P.P. Kapoor distributed copies of the agreement between the Ecogreen Energy and India Green to claim that the former had violated ‘No Partnership’ clause of the concession agreement. The two firms have signed the agreement for a period of one year from March 1 for wards no. 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 9 of Zone-II.

‘Clause 19.9: No Partnership’ of the concession agreement says that “nothing contained in this agreement shall be construed or interpreted to create an association, joint venture or partnership between the parties”.

Mr. Kapoor also claimed that the husband of the head of the Project Monitoring Unit, responsible for the enforcement of the concession agreement, was employed on a senior position in Ecogreen Energy in a direct “conflict of interest”.

No response from CEO

Ecogreen Deputy CEO Sanjay Singh and the PMU head Sonia did not respond to calls and messages.

Mr. Kapoor said the reply to his RTI application had revealed that Municipal Corporation Faridabad had imposed a fine of ₹1.57 crore and the Municipal Corporation Gurugram had imposed penalties in 400 instances on the concessionaire following complaints received on social media and monitoring by the municipal corporation staffers.

He claimed the MCG did not reveal the amount of fine imposed on the company and an appeal was pending in this connection.

The MCG has the right to cancel the concession agreement in case aggregated liquidated damages levied by it on the company on account of non-performance exceed ₹7 lakh for a quarter. Haryana State Pollution Control Board also imposed a fine of ₹25 lakh on Ecogreen last year.

Mr. Kapoor said the two municipal corporations had together paid ₹126 crore to the concessionaire over the past 30 months to transport 18 lakh ton waste to Bandhwari.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/concessionaire-of-waste-management-project-accused-of-violating-agreement-clause/article32866245.ece

279,2020/10/16,Forwarded Rakul Preet Singh’s grievances to NBA: Centre to HC,"The Centre has informed the Delhi High Court on Thursday that it has forwarded grievances of actor Rakul Preet Singh, regarding media reports linking her with the drug case being probed by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), to the News Broadcasters Association (NBA).

The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) informed Justice Navin Chawla that on October 9 it issued an advisory to all private satellite TV channels to adhere to the programme code provided under the Cable Television Networks Rules.

Advocate Aman Hingorani, representing the actor, however said that he was not satisfied by the steps taken by the Ministry as instead of taking any action it has merely forwarded the petition filed by Ms. Singh to be treated as a representation to the NBA.

NBA’s counsel said that it heard the actor on October 3 and then again on October 12 and also 10 media channels. The counsel sought three more weeks to file a report with regard to the outcome of the hearings.

Justice Navin Chawla, however, directed NBA to take a decision within two weeks and file a status report regarding the same. It posted the case for further hearing on December 11.

In her application, the 29-year-old actor has alleged the media of “simply running fake news” which are not based on “true, correct and verified facts”. Ms Singh said the media’s slander campaign against her has “irreparably damaged her reputation, dignity and clean image, and flagrantly violated her privacy and right to be left alone”.

281,2020/10/16,Views on creation,"The ultimate purpose of human existence is to realise Brahman and the main aim of scriptural texts is to lead the individual to this goal. To enable each one to know one’s own true self, scriptures explain creation from two angles and this aspect is analysed in the text Laghu Vasudeva Mananam, pointed out Sri R. Rajagopala Sarma in a discourse.

One view is known as Krama srishti, that is, the gradual evolution of the universe with all its infinite variety from its very source called Moola prakriti. From this are derived Maya, Avidya, Avarana, Vikshepa, ether, air, fire, water and earth. This view regards the five elements as the cause of the gross, subtle and causal bodies. But there is another view known as Yugapath Srishti where the causal body or karana sarira is shown to be the ultimate cause of the other two bodies, the gross and the subtle. This is based on the belief that ignorance alone is the cause of the self getting associated with the gross, subtle and causal bodies. The subtle body is also known as the Linga-sarira as it carries on the latent impressions until the soul attains liberation. The subtle body functions through the seventeen organs, the five jnanendriyas, the five karmendriyas, the five pranas, the mind and the buddhi. Careful examination of the acts such as seeing, hearing, etc, will show that these are solely the functions of the subtle body and not the gross body. This is confirmed in the case of deep sleep, swoon state and death, where the gross body is present, but the activity of the seventeen organs is not seen.

Ignorance that leads one to believe unreal as real is cause of all sorrows like the experience felt when one misunderstands the rope to be a snake. One has to engage in viveka and vichara in all sincerity to be freed from this ignorance.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/views-on-creation/article32875888.ece
282,2020/10/16,Bhakti bhava,"It is the tradition to call devotional hymns ‘paa maalai,’ a garland of verses that can never fade, as is the case with the Tiruppavai hymns that Andal offers to the Lord along with the garland of flowers. It is also a fact that if such devout hymns are always evergreen and strike a chord with like-minded bhaktas, it is owing to the inherent power or atma shakti in them that never diminishes even with the passage of time, pointed out Sri B. Sundarkumar in a discourse. It is possible to revisit the intense emotion and thought expressed in the devotional hymns of Azhwars every time they are recited, recalled or meditated upon.

Kulasekhara Azhwar’s bhakti bhava overflows as the Mukunda Mala Stotra and it is truly a ‘paa maalai’ that sings praises on the Lord’s endless auspicious qualities. The first and foremost bhava is paying obeisance and this is signified in the phrase Vande Mukundam Aravinda Dalaya Daksham. It is clear that by paying obeisance to the Lord the jivatma stands to benefit, as it gives him much Sreyas when God comes forward to save him from samsara. The epithet Aravinda Dalaya Daksham refers to the lotus eyed Lord. The Upanishads such as the Chandogya describe His eyes that resemble the lotus as His unique characteristic.

The Bhagavata purana states that when as Varaha He snorts and grunts, His eyes shine with brilliance to reveal His identity to Brahma and the rishis. In Narasimha avatar, His form is terrible but His eyes are full of compassion. In Rama avatar, He is always addressed as kamala patraksha; Sabhari realises Rama as the ultimate goal and resort. She says she has been purified by His kind glances.

283,2020/10/16,Sailors turned saviours on Hyderabad’s night of deluge,"National champion K. Gowtham and fellow sailors Y. Prasad and M. Saibaba led rescue efforts.

Equipped with salvage boats and sailing equipment, sailors and support staff led by national champion K. Gowtham waded through canals amid blinding rain and gusty winds to conduct rescue operations, steering many citizens in submerged colonies to safety.

Gowtham and his fellow national sailors, Y. Prasad of Rasoolpura, and M. Saibaba, a bronze medallist in the Optimist class in 2017 now working as the Yacht Club coach, used the same boats they had sailed in for the Nationals. With inflatables, radios and jackets, they proved to be the unlikely saviours, even as many government personnel also worked overnight to reach out to rain-hit citizens.

The sailors were aided by a voluntary organisation called SDIF, headed by Mohammad Azam Khan. “We got a call around 7 a.m. on October 13, saying that about 500 people were stranded and unable to get out of their houses. So our coaches responded immediately. Never in the past 40 years have I seen such a deluge at the lake, and it was surreal as wind and water lashed the Hussainsagar in the dead of night,” recalls Suheim Sheikh, president of the Yacht Club.

“We lost a load of expensive equipment, including an engine. One of our boats sank as they were not designed for or anchored to suit such intense conditions. But all our coaches are trained swimmers and lifeguards and the least we could do was help when the city needed such skills,” he added

Gowtham and Saibaba headed out to Tolichowki, rescuing people in low-lying colonies adjacent to lakes. Prasad, on the other hand, left for Saroornagar and managed to ferry 15 families to safety, after which he headed to Rasoolpura with his boat as he got a call from Shaik Nayeem of the Kriya Sangh Society, informing him that water levels there were rising rapidly.

By the end of the rescue job, the national champions had trained many local volunteers, and left the Yacht Club boats behind, which were used through the night. Azam Khan, who heads SDIF, was full of praise for Gowtham, Prasad and Saibaba, who, in four small Optimist class boats, rescued about 1,600 citizens in two days.

284,2020/10/16,Civilians step in to help the rain-hit stay afloat,"Volunteers use social media to identify those in distress

Citizen and civilian groups have brought in a deft homely touch to the relief effort mounted in Hyderabad after the unprecedented deluge. Masks, hand sanitisers, soaps, phenyl and sambar powder in dry rations are part of the packages being distributed by civilian groups who are using social media to mop up funds as well as reach out to the affected people.

“We distributed hygiene kits to people at shelter homes. The kits include masks, sanitisers and soaps so that people can protect themselves from the pandemic,” says Sai Teja, an IT professional, whose team is bringing relief to flood-affected. “People don’t have clothes; all their clothes have been damaged. These are people residing in localities like Old Bowenpally, Gaganpahad, Nadeem Colony and other areas. We managed to distribute some blankets but more effort is needed,” he adds.

“Bhai agar kisi ku bhi Malakpet ke in and around khaney ki zaroorat hai toh please 88xxx-456x5 yeh number pe contact karey (Anyone living in and around Malakpet needs food can contact this number 88xxx-456x5).” This message on social media was enough. Muhammad Arshad’s phone has not stopped ringing since and he has not stopped distributing food for the past three days. “My phone battery used to last 48 hours. Now it gets discharged within 10 hours. I am getting calls from Shastripuram, Shaheennagar, Bandlaguda Jagir, Nadeem Colony and I am able to distribute food there,” says Arshad who promised details or photos of beneficiaries won’t be shared.

Arshad and Sai Teja are not alone. There are others like Suhasini Sarvey in Cantonment area, Md Imran in Moosanagar, and countless others who stepped up and helped bring some relief to those marooned or displaced due to the massive flooding on October 13-14.

“Citizens and citizen groups have been at the forefront of relief effort for the past 15 days. More than 500 persons are working to distribute food and medicines in the city, taking immense risk. It is not that the government is not doing anything; it is not doing enough,” said Sajaya, a social activist about the ongoing relief effort.

287,2020/10/16,"13-year-old’s death sparks outrage among people, women’s groups demand speedy justice","Girl set ablaze for resisting rape attempt.

Amid outpouring of anguish, the last rites of the 13-year-old Dalit girl, who died during treatment for her burn injuries at a private hospital in Hyderabad on Thursday night, nearly four weeks after she was set ablaze by a 25-year-old married man when she resisted his alleged rape attempt at his house here, were performed at her native village Pallegudem near here on Friday afternoon.

The victim, who worked as a domestic help at the house of the accused Allam Maraiah, of Mustafanagar here, suffered around 70% burns after the latter allegedly poured petrol on her before setting her ablaze after a failed rape attempt on September 18.

In view of the closure of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the poor parents of the girl sent her (their second daughter) to Khammam to work as a domestic help to surmount mounting debt burden, sources close to the victim's family said.

The gruesome incident came to light around 15 days after the actual crime as the accused, who hails from the same community as the victim, admitted her to a local private hospital clandestinely and tried to cover up the crime by resorting to intimidating tactics.

For nearly a fortnight, the girl suffered in silence at the private hospital, the management of which kept the matter confidential and treated the injured girl in the regular ward, devoid of a specialised burns ward.

The incident came to the fore belatedly on October 5 after a video clip showing the bed-ridden girl narrating her heart-wrenching ordeal went viral on social media.

Following public outcry, the authorities shifted the girl to Osmania General Hospital in Hyderabad the same day and a few days later moved her to a private hospital in the State capital for better treatment.

The district health authorities sealed Sri Pooja hospital in Khammam on October 8 for failing to inform the police about the Medico Legal Case.

The Khammam one town police booked Maraiah under the provisions of the POCSO Act and other relevant Sections of the IPC on October 5. On October 6, Maraiah was arrested and produced before a local court. He was remanded in judicial custody for two weeks on the same day.

The body of the victim was brought to Pallegudem from Hyderabad amid tight security arrangements on Friday morning.

Transport Minister P Ajay Kumar along with Collector R V Karnan consoled the bereaved family members of the victim and assured to look after their welfare. The officials handed over a cheque for ₹2 lakh to the parents of the victim.

Tension prevailed in the village later in the day when activists of various women's organisations including the AIDWA and the POW staged a demonstration with the body of the victim at the burial ground.

They raised slogans demanding a speedy trial of the horrific case and harshest punishment for the accused.

The women activists including the AIDWA State secretary Mallu Lakshmi consoled the grieving mother of the victim and vowed to ensure speedy justice for her.

The distraught mother of the victim said, “They (officials) asked me to sign on a paper before handing over a cheque for ₹2 lakh. We want speedy justice and stiffer punishment for the accused, she said crying inconsolably minutes before the final rites of her daughter.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ttwubn/article32876562.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-khammam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/13-year-olds-death-sparks-outrage-among-people-womens-groups-demand-speedy-justice/article32872619.ece

291,2020/10/16,Hyderabad floods | Lake encroachments led to flooding,"Messages for help started within hours of downpour

The message for help was on social media within hours of the beginning of the downpour on Tuesday night. The location: Chakradhar Colony, Nagaram. A quick search on the map reveals the colony to be built to the north of the Nagaram lake. Search for the locality 20 years ago and it doesn’t exist. Twenty years ago, the land where the colony exists now was part of the lake. Till 2015 the colony didn’t exist.

The same story repeats in various other localities where flooding has wrecked havoc due to the heaviest rainfall in recorded history in Hyderabad. Boduppal, Bandari Colony, Nadeem Colony, Macca Colony, Singareni Colony, Vambay Colony and Gaganpahad area. A corollary to the flooding in these localities is no change in the water quality or levels in the lake near Taj Banjara Hotel, Masab Tank and Mir Alam Tank. On Thursday when the city was coming to terms with the flood and estimating the damage, rain water didn’t even dislodge the water hyacinth plants in the Mir Alam Tank or the pond scum in Masab Tank.

Housing colonies

But the same could not be said about the lakes and tanks in the southern part of Hyderabad. Yerra Kunta, Madikunta, Jalapalli, Umda Sagar and Palle Cheruvu were just a series of interconnected lakes bound by rocks and natural terrain about 20 years ago. But a series of housing colonies for the poor built on land reclaimed from lakes and encroachments by prospectors has shrunk the lakes. On Thursday water overflowed the lakes and flowed onto the roads and open spaces. But on Wednesday at about 1.20 a.m., water from these lakes had raced onto opens spaces and crashed a wall, upturned vehicles plying on roads and killed at least three persons in the Gaganpahad area.

Incidentally, the flooding has affected many plots that have been created on the lake beds near Jalapally. “Encroached land is almost free but if the same plot has to be purchased it will cost a lot.

292,2020/10/16,State targets paddy cultivation on 50 lakh acres in Yasangi,"Chief Minister for regulated cropping as continuous process in the interest of farmers

The State government has exhorted farmers to take up paddy cultivation in 50 lakh acres and other crops in another 15 lakh acres during Yasangi (Rabi) 2020-21.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the Agriculture Department officials to sensitise farmers about the crops that should be sown district, mandal and cluster wise. Farmers followed the regulated cropping pattern suggested by the government during the Vaanakalam (kharif) season and the same spirit should be followed in the ensuing rabi. The Chief Minister convened a meeting to prepare a plan of action for the crops that should be taken up in the ensuing season with senior officials on Thursday. The agricultural officers submitted the estimates prepared relating to kharif cultivation that were prepared on the directions given by the Chief Minister during the recent meeting.

The meeting elaborately discussed the current cropping pattern and prepared the action plan for the coming season. Accordingly, it was decided to take up paddy cultivation in 50 lakh acres, Bengal gram in 4.5 lakh acres, groundnut (4 lakh acres) and other crops including chillies, vegetables and other pulses in the remaining extent. The government had taken steps to ensure timely supply of seed and fertilizer pertaining to these crops.

He exhorted farmers to take up cultivation following the advise of the agricultural officers so that they could secure remunerative prices for their produce. The regulated cropping introduced by the government should accordingly become a continuous process and detailed reports on the cropping pattern, extent on which different crops were sown and other issues should be prepared by the officials concerned.

Officials should be prepared with action plan for the next season once sowing operations of the existing season were completed. The Rythu Bandhu Samitis constituted by the government should play an active role in this direction. Since the completion of a majority of the Rythu Vedikas was expected to be completed by Dasara, the samitis should utilise them for forging effective coordination with farmers. “People will not accept change in a single attempt and new systems will be adapted effectively with consistent attempts. Farmers need to be sensitised that the steps taken by the government are in their interests,” the Chief Minister said.

Mr. Rao advised farmers against cultivation of maize as there is uncertainty over the price as well as the market conditions for the produce. Officials should accordingly educate farmers about these aspects involved in taking up cultivation of the crop as there is no scope for providing minimum support price of more than ₹900 a quintal for the crop.

The Chief Minister reiterated that cultivation of maize is risky and decision on the cultivation of the crop should be left to farmers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ezxbcf/article32866703.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy15CM1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/state-targets-paddy-cultivation-on-50-lakh-acres-in-yasangi/article32866704.ece

295,2020/10/16,Rain in Krishna basin to bring more flood,"Discharge of flood at Jurala, Srisailam increased to 6 lakh cusecs each

Jurala, Srisailam, Nagarjunasagar and Pulichintala projects in the two Telugu States are expected to get huge flood over the next two-three days in spite of let-up in the rain in the local catchment areas as there was a heavy rainfall in the upper Krishna, Bhima and Tungabhadra catchment areas during the 24-hour period up to 8.30 a.m. on Thursday.

Quoting IMD reports, an advisory issued by the Central Water Commission (CWC) stated that there was 140 mm rain in Ujjani dam area, 136 mm in Augumbe, 126 mm in Mahabaleshwar, 92 mm in Veer dam area, 81 mm in Almatti dam area and 64 mm in Koyna dam area during the period.

“As all the reservoirs in the sub-basins of Krishna are full any flood reaching them would invariably be released downstream,” flood monitoring officials told The Hindu.

‘Maintain caution’

As the CWC has advised authorities of all dams in the Krishna Basin to maintain a safe flood cushion by taking up pre-depletion of water since huge flood was expected to reach them, the engineers at Jurala and Srisailam projects have already taken up the task of discharging about 6 lakh cusecs of flood each although the inflows were in lesser measure.

“Flood level in Bhima at Deongaon bridge in Kalaburagi district has crossed danger level of 404.5 metres on Thursday night and it is expected to go up further,” an irrigation official at Jurala said.

The discharge of flood wafter at the Jurala project was about 5.9 lakh cusecs from 50 spillway gates on Thursday night and it was in the same measure at Srisailam too with 5.64 lakh cusecs from 10 spillway gates lifted for 25-foot height each and another 26,500 cusecs of fflod water from the right bank power house.

In a flood warning message that was issued to the authorities of Nagarjunsagar, the Superintending Engineer of Srisailam project, Mr K. Srinivasulu stated, “The Krishna river is receiving heavy flood due to heavy rainfall in the upstream catchment. In anticipation of flood to accommodate the inflows, Srisailam reservoir water level is being depleted to 880 ft, against full reservoir of 885 ft, level to maintain buffer”.

Sagar outflows

At 9 p.m., the outflows at Nagarjunasagar also increased to over 5 lakh cusecs as the inflows were about 4.84 lakh cusecs.

The flood water being released at the Srisailam project would start reaching Nagarjunasagar in the wee hours of Friday.

In Godavari Basin, all projects including Singur, Nizamsagar, Sriramsagar, Mid Manair, Lower Manair, Kaddam, Yellampally and others were also getting good inflows of flood water.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rain-in-krishna-basin-to-bring-more-flood/article32865963.ece

304,2020/10/16,Over four acres of barren land turn into green patches,"‘Pachathuruthu’ initiative in local bodies in district

Twenty-three local bodies in Ernakulam have converted nearly 4.41 acres of barren land into lush patches as part of the government’s ‘Pachathuruthu’ initiative.

The objective of the Statewide project launched under the Haritha Keralam Mission was to tackle the issue of climate change by increasing the green cover. The guidelines issued by the mission had stated that green islands could be set up in government or private land, puramboke, city centres and unused land. The larger objective was to create mini forests across the State in a phased manner.

Local bodies in Ernakulam that have set up green pastures include Palakuzha (50 cents); Pampakuda (30); Vadekkakara (30); Valakom (31); Vayakkara LP School, Ramamangalam (25); Vazhakkulam (25); Varapetti (25); Govt ITI, Kalamassery (20); Ramamangalam (18) and Thirumaradi (18).

“Geographical mapping of green islands has been done to ensure regular monitoring. It will help policy makers and local bodies identify the location of green pastures, besides taking stock of the types of trees and plants available in each area,” said Sujith Karun, District Coordinator of Haritha Keralam Mission.

Officials of the Forest Department, MGNREGA, Biodiversity Board, environmental organisations, educational institutions, and the Haritha Keralam Mission had provided expert training to elected representatives, officials, and biodiversity committee representatives in each local body. A handbook was also distributed among stakeholders.

Local bodies were told to promote planting of local species of trees and plants in the land selected for the project. The idea was to have natural and biodiverse islands. Panchayats were encouraged to set up plants and trees that help in generating a steady income. They can also set up green islands exclusively for medicinal plants, according to project guidelines.

Mr. Karun said that many areas that were used for dumping solid waste had now turned into green patches as part of the project. “Local residents had joined the venture as they had the twin advantage of saying no to waste dumping and creating a green island, where all of them could breathe fresh air and meet regularly,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/over-four-acres-of-barren-land-turn-into-green-patches/article32866361.ece
305,2020/10/16,Walkway along Periyar mooted to check industrial pollution,"SLMC recommends construction of facility close to companies

The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management constituted by the National Green Tribunal has recommended the construction of an inspection bridge similar to a walkway along the banks of the Periyar for effective surveillance against industrial pollution.

The proposal has been placed before the tribunal among other recommendations to save the river from indiscriminate human and industrial pollution. “Construction of such a bridge cannot be dispensed with for the reason that it is expensive. One should be reminded of the following words of Guy McPherson, an American environmentalist — If you think the economy is more important than the environment, try holding your breath while counting your money. Unless, the rivers in the State are rejuvenated, posterity will give a judgement against the present generation,” said A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, chairman of SLMC, in his report filed before the Southern Bench of the tribunal.

Saving time

The proposal is to have the bridge close to the industrial units situated along the river. “This could be useful for inspection without losing much time when a suspected case of industrial pollution is reported in the river. The collection of samples is usually done by State Pollution Control Board officials by using a boat to reach the spot, where the pollution has occurred. Effluents would be often washed away by the time enforcement officials reach the spot because of the water flow in the river,” said Mr. Pillai. He said that the proposed walkway has to be set up close to the compound wall of industrial units. “It will save considerable time in identifying those responsible for the pollution of the river as officials could reach the site immediately,” he said. The committee had found that thick bushes on the banks of the river and outside the compound wall of industrial units at Edayar were hampering the surveillance process carried out by the board. This has to be carried out with the assistance of the Irrigation Department, it said.

The committee has recommended that the local bodies along the banks of the Periyar river should close down any industry or establishment within their limits found violating the provisions and dumping effluents into the river. The civic bodies have to step up surveillance by installing CCTV facility, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/walkway-along-periyar-mooted-to-check-industrial-pollution/article32866325.ece
306,2020/10/16,Catamaran ferries to be rolled out in Nov.,"West Kochi and Vypeen services to have safer, faster vessels

The State Water Transport Department’s (SWTD) fleet of single hull, slow-moving steel vessels that operate from the city to West Kochi and Vypeen will shortly be replaced with modern catamarans that are safer, faster and much more comfortable.

The new vessels will have fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) hull, which is popular worldwide. The catamaran (twin hull design) will provide them the much-needed stability. This will prevent frequent visits to the workshop to overcome corrosion that is a bane for steel vessels. They will also cause much less noise pollution and vibration, as compared to the vessels that operate now, said Shaji V. Nair, Director of the department.

A pair of 100-seater catamaran ferries that were built as per Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) norms will be commissioned in Kochi in November. They will have two engines, to ensure their safety even if an engine develops snag. The vessels will also operate at upto 8 knots (around 15 km/hr) speed (as compared to existing vessels that operate at less than 10 km/hr speed), he added.

The sole IRS-class vessel which was in operation in Kochi till the pandemic was Vega-120, SWTD’s fast ferry that operated in the Vaikom-Ernakulam-Fort Kochi route. It operated at more than double the speed of existing steel ferries.

Another four catamaran FRP ferries with more of less similar specifications are being built at another yard in the suburbs of Kochi. One of them will be commissioned in December and a second in January 2021. The other two will follow suit.

Solar tourist boat

The department would also roll out its first solar-powered tourist boat in Kochi, by December end. “The catamaran vessel will be air-conditioned and have an upper deck for guests to have a sound view of the backwaters. We plan to launch it in December end,” Mr. Nair said.

It operates two non-AC tourist services in the Alappuzha-Kollam route and in Kuttanad. Close on the heels of launching a water taxi service in Alappuzha on October 15, the department is readying to launch one such vessel in Kochi in November. It too will have solar panels on the roof, to provide energy for the electrical components. Guests will be able to rent out the 10-seater vessel.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/catamaran-ferries-to-be-rolled-out-in-nov/article32866295.ece
307,2020/10/16,"Over 1,000 Chinese nets to be dismantled","Traditional fishers at Kumbalanghi welcome move by Fisheries dept., say it was ‘long overdue’

Over a thousand unlicensed Chinese nets (commonly called dip nets) in the picturesque Kumbalanghi backwaters are slated to be dismantled by the Fisheries Department early November following a Kerala High Court directive.

Traditional fishers across the political spectrum have welcomed the decision and called it ‘long overdue’ and in the best interest of artisanal fishers, who depend on the backwaters for a living.

In solidarity

“Dip nets in the Kumbalanghi backwaters have broken all the regulations governing inland fisheries. They have disrupted normal activities of traditional fishers, and small boat owners will be mobilised to display solidarity with the departmental action,” said State convener of Fisheries Coordination Committee Charles George in support of the decision to dismantle the nets.

“It has become an industry disrupting movement of boats and traditional fishing activities by those who live close to the backwaters,” said P.K. Shivadattan, social activist and former president of the Kumbalanghi grama panchayat.

But dip net owner Paul Kannamchery differs. “It is a livelihood means. If they are being dismantled, the government must direct us to some other means of daily sustenance,” he said.

Panchayat president Martin Anthony welcomed the high court order and said the dip nets should be taken away. However, some consideration should be given to small fishers, who live off the backwaters using these nets, he added.

Rampant violations

Mr. George said that dip nets in the Kumbalangi backwaters rampantly violated rules regarding the distance from the shore at which they can be erected; that a person should not own more than one net; that they should be erected at specified distance from each other, and that they should not use lights of more than 100-W capacity.

“However, people from different walks of life have turned dip nets into an investment, some of them reportedly owning more than a dozen of them. They deploy workers from other States on a purely commercial basis,” he said. “There were just 74 dip nets in the Kumbalanghi backwaters in 2010. The number has now gone up to more than a thousand,” he added.

Most of the nets are located on the eastern side of the Kumbalanghi-Perumpadappu bridge running in northerly and southerly directions. In some of the areas, like the junction where the Aroor backwaters meet the Kumbalanghi backwaters, some nets have been erected across the backwaters totally blocking traffic and other fishing activities, alleged Mr. Shivadattan.

Fisheries Department sources said that the owners would first be asked to dismantle the nets on their own before it takes the action. The department would also issue a public notice via newspapers to the owners.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/t6tglh/article32866281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16KIKUMBALANGHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/over-1000-chinese-nets-to-be-dismantled/article32866282.ece
308,2020/10/16,Where old kerosene lamps work like a charm,"Kerosene lamps are used to draw shrimps into the net at the harvest time.

Lighting technology has evolved rapidly over the years. Who remembers bee wax, and fish and vegetable oil lamps? The technology to light up our lives has evolved through gas lamps, incandescent bulbs and compact fluorescent lamps. And LED lighting systems hold the sway now.

But there are still fans of the old kerosene lamps around us, who deploy them for a rich shrimp harvest in the pokkali paddies of coastal Kerala mostly between the months of October and May in the one paddy-one-fish cycle.

Bright light attracts shrimp into the paddies from the wild when the sluice gates are opened. These lights are also used to draw shrimps into the net at the harvest time, says M.K. Radhakrishnan, 56, from Edavanakkad, who has been making these lamps for as long as he can remember.

He says that the season has just begun and there is some demand even now despite a lot of different types of lighting systems being available in the market. The pokkali shrimp season is just opening up with farmers having carried out the pond preparations in most of the places in the coastal areas like Chellanam, Edavanakkad, Varappuzha, Paravoor, Ezhikkara, Poothotta and Kodungalloor.

K.C. Joseph, 67, works out of his shop at Njarakkal where he began to make kerosene lamps in the early 1970s. There is still a belief that shrimps only come drawn by these kerosene lamps, he says with a tinge of laughter in his lips. There are all sorts of lamps around now, especially solar lamps, he says.

But the old charm persists though Mr. Joseph makes them only in his spare time as the lamps take a lot of time for fabrication, which is all done by hand. No machine work, he emphasises. He repairs gas stoves, electrical contraptions and does all kinds of utility jobs out of his shop.

The lamps used by shrimp farmers and the ones being fabricated by craftsmen like him and Mr. Radhakrishnan is a traditional variation of the old hurricane lamp. In Malayalam, it is descriptively called ‘Koodu vilakku’ or a lamp in a nest. The base of the standard, 18-inch version is glass; so are the lamp protected on all its vertical sides by clear glass, which helps radiate the kerosene lamp light, says Mr. Radhakrishnan.

There is a burner, which holds the wick, a knob to adjust the length of wick as well as a fuel chamber and opening on top which acts as the exhaust.

Being of a traditional nature in design and fuel, the lamps, which are now being fabricated in various sizes, have drawn the attention of interior decorators. Mr. Radhakrishnan says that some of the lamps have been ordered for those who decorate stages and podiums for various social functions like marriage.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/tk4d9f/article32866263.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16-KI-LAMPS-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/where-old-kerosene-lamps-work-like-a-charm/article32866264.ece

COVID-19 has offered an opportunity to explore more deeply the potential of Ayurveda and adopt an integrative approach for innovative solutions to the pandemic, Governor Arif Mohammed Khan said on Thursday.

He was addressing the valedictory session of the Global Ayurved Summit organised under the aegis of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said a press release here.

Mr. Khan said the pandemic had turned the world’s attention to the immune system. In the present scenario, the role of Ayurveda is of paramount importance.

310,2020/10/16,Stakeholders advice caution while reopening tourism sector,"‘Most tourism players have not registered ventures, thus escaping inspections’

Even as tourism locales began reopening in a phased manner from Monday, stakeholders have expressed concern at a section of tourism entrepreneurs being slack in adhering to the special operation procedures (SOPs) announced by the government to prevent the spread of the pandemic.

The concern is valid, especially since a sizeable share of tourism players have not registered their ventures, thus escaping the ambit of routine inspections by tourism and other agencies, said George Scaria, president, Tourism Professionals Club, a body that has been furthering the cause of accountability in the sector. “This was especially true of many hotels and other properties, who, in their eagerness to earn revenue, overlooked violation of safety norms, ever since they reopened in June following lockdown relaxations. There were also reports of many domestic tourists, mostly from other States, flouting the COVID-19 protocol and not reporting if they tested positive after staying in hotels,” he added.

Under this circumstance, a group of tourism enthusiasts recently demanded that the Kerala Tourism constitute a monitoring committee to oversee the functioning of tourism enterprises. District Tourism Promotion Councils (DTPCs) and tourism officials who were entrusted with ensuring adherence to the protocol must begin screening tourism ventures and guests who arrive, so that the renewed tourism activities do not in any way contribute to rise in COVID-19 cases. All this is a must to usher in confidence among well-meaning guests, Mr. Scaria observed. He further demanded that the government roll out a long-term plan to retain the interest of foreign tourists in Kerala.

The Responsible Tourism Mission has, in the meantime, issued directions to rural tourism stakeholders to adhere to the physical distancing protocol, mandatory wearing of face masks, transparent face shields, and frequent sanitising, to ensure responsible travel during the pandemic. “For instance, we have told organisers of experiential tourism packages to dissuade tourists from partaking in manufacture of pottery and coir. But they can witness from close quarters artists and workers engaged in such activities. Online meetings were held with operators of homestays and other enterprises to apprise them of the need to ensure hygiene and sanitised environs,” said K. Rupesh Kumar, State coordinator of the mission.

Hospitality and other tourism ventures in locales like Kumarakom have begun getting enquiries, especially from tourists from north India who want to visit Kerala for a week and leave, to avoid quarantine, he added.

The Kerala Tourism has issued sector-specific norms, said sources in the Ernakulam DTPC. In this, officials ought to be deployed at entry points of tourism locales, equipped with thermal scanners and sanitisers. Details of visitors must be entered in a register. In addition, the do’s and dont’s of the COVID-19 protocol must be prominently displayed, while physical distancing must be ensured. Toilets and rest rooms ought to be fumigated and cleaned frequently, they said. DTPC-managed destinations are reopening in a phased manner.

A senior Kerala Tourism official said it would be tough to keep tabs on all private ventures with the existing manpower. “At best, we can report violations to the District Collector,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/hdflv6/article32866073.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16-KI-KUZHUPPILLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/stakeholders-advice-caution-while-reopening-tourism-sector/article32866074.ece
311,2020/10/16,Thoppumpady fishing harbour to reopen today,"Boat operators, workers agree on arrival of boats from Tamil Nadu

The Thoppumpady fishing harbour, which has been lying idle over the past four days, will reopen on Friday following reconciliation between purse seine boat operators and harbour workers over the arrival of longline and gillnet boats from Tamil Nadu at the harbour.

The harbour, the biggest such facility in Kerala, has a business turnover of around ₹100 crore a year and is the lifeline of West Kochi, source of daily employment for around 5,000 people, and the supply centre for fish processing units at Edakochi and Alappuzha’s northern towns like Eramalloor and Aroor.

The arrival of a fleet of longline and gillnet boats last Saturday at the harbour had triggered a standoff between purse seine boat operators, who refused to allow longline and gillnet catch being unloaded and auctioned off at the harbour.

Four of such boats operated by Tamil Nadu fishers were seized by Fisheries Department officials and fined, as they had violated the COVID-19 protocol. According to the protocol, boats from other States are banned from entering Kerala fishing harbours. The boats, numbering around 650, have been operating out of Thoppumpady for over half a century, said fishers’ union leaders and fish traders, who demanded that they be allowed into the harbour.

But purse seine boat operators’ attitude towards gillnet boats provoked harbour workers, and they refused to handle catch landed by purse seine boats, following which operations at the harbour came to a standstill four days ago.

Harbour Coordination Committee leader M. Majeed said talks on the initiative of Cochin Port Labour Union leader B. Hamsa on Thursday had brought peace to the harbour, as both purse seine boat operators and harbour workers agreed to cooperate, even as they respected the protocol.

For now, gillnet and longline boats will follow the State government’s orders on pandemic containment. It was also decided to approach the government seeking an amendment to COVID-19 containment rules and allow Tamil Nadu fishers to operate out of Thoppumpady, Mr. Majeed added.

Longline and gillnet boats account for the bulk of the annual ₹100-crore business at the harbour, and there was considerable fear that the boats would migrate to Mangaluru. In fact, a few boats had left for the northern harbour after Monday, Mr. Majeed said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/thoppumpady-fishing-harbour-to-reopen-today/article32865964.ece

The US Consulate General, Chennai, in association with the city-based Centre for Public Policy Research (CPPR), released Community Resilience Handbook for Disaster Preparedness and Management in English and Malayalam at a virtual event here on Thursday.

Anne Lee Seshadri, Public Affairs Officer at the U.S. Consulate General in Chennai, released the handbook, which is the key outcome of the America with Kerala: Uniting for a Disaster Resilient Kerala project organised in association with CPPR and the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA).

“I hope that the outcome of the America with Kerala project will contribute to advancing US-India ties and collaborations in the area of disaster management,” she said.

Following the launch, CPPR chairman D. Dhanuraj moderated a panel discussion on ‘All-Hazards Approach to Community-Based Disaster Risk Mitigation’.

Muralee Thummarukudy, Chief of Disaster Risk Reduction, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), said, “If the disaster management curriculum that is being worked on as part of the America with Kerala project is introduced in our universities, it will have a long-lasting impact on our communities. Empowering the community with knowledge and resources is the global best practice in disaster mitigation,” he observed.

Nivedita P. Haran, Honorary Chairperson, Board of Directors, Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development, Kerala, said, “Wherever women have come forward to become a part of the risk reduction process, the results have been extremely effective.”

313,2020/10/16,Youngster arrested with ecstacy pills,"He used to procure drugs from Bengaluru

The city police arrested a person with 10 ecstasy tablets from Palarivattom on Thursday.

The arrested is Jabir, 21, of Edathala. According to the police, the accused used to procure drugs from Bengaluru through middlemen and sold them at higher margins to youngsters in Vyttila and Palarivattom areas. Also known just as ‘pills’ among users and sought after at rave parties, high dosage of the drug could even lead to death, the police said.

The arrest was based on a tip-off received by District Police Chief (Kochi City) Vijay Sakhare. A team led by District Anti-Narcotic Special Action Force (DANSAF) Sub Inspector Joseph Sajan and Palarivattom Sub Inspector Lijo Joseph made the arrest on the orders of Assistant Commissioner (Narcotics) Abdul Salam.

Theft

Gold ornaments weighing around 13 sovereigns and valued at ₹13 lakh were found stolen from an office of the Cochin Devaswom Board adjoining the Siva-Subramanya Temple at Vyttila.

The theft came to the notice of the board employees who found the office broken open on Thursday morning. The ornaments belonging to multiple temples under the board were largely received as offerings from devotees and were put on idols during special occasions.

The ornaments were kept in four almirahs of which three were found broken into. An iron rod purportedly used for the theft was recovered from the vicinity.

A case has been registered invoking IPC Sections 457 (Lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night) 461 (breaks open or unfastens any closed receptacle which contains or which he believes to contain property) and 380 (theft).

314,2020/10/16,Why it is important for India’s fashion designers to be online,"Why did it take a global pandemic for Indian fashion designers to realise that having their own retail website is a must in today’s world?

We’re in 2020. So it strikes me as strange that a majority of India’s fashion designers did not have their own e-commerce websites till the realities of the Covid-19 pandemic brought that point home. Many still don’t.

A report by the Indian Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF) says that India’s e-commerce market is expected to grow from $38.5 billion in 2017 to $200 billion by 2026. Even the most traditional touch-and-feel retailers, our high-end jewellers, took to e-commerce years ago. But it is only in the past six months that we’ve seen designer websites pop up one after another. Finally.

From established names like JJ Valaya, Gaurav Gupta, and Amit Aggarwal to upcoming ones like Kshitij Jalori and Qbik, many have taken this time to launch their e-com platforms. Rishab Mehra, Founder of Growify, a company that provides end-to-end e-commerce solutions, counts over 15 fashion labels, big and small — from Namrata Joshipura to Rabani & Rakha, Keerthi Kadire to Nikita Mahisalkar — who’ve worked with his firm to launch their websites since the lockdown. He has 10 more in the works. But what held them back so far?

JJ Valaya’s Chevron collection

A virtual translation

The answer may lie in the simple problem of perception. “Most designers who came to us sought to translate their real-life experiences online,” says Mehra. “But brand-centric websites are often optimised for the desktop or laptop, while the majority of traffic now comes from mobile devices.” A website dedicated to replicating a brand ‘experience’ is rarely successful at achieving conversions — tech-speak for selling. There is just too much storytelling involved; retail tends to take a back seat. Besides, a website needs constant investment — targeted digital ads and promotions to reach and build the intended audience and analytics that need constant crunching to widen the reach.

Back in 1994, JJ Valaya was the first Indian designer to launch a simple website to introduce his brand to the world. It lay fallow in that avatar till he started working on his comeback collection (he’d taken a two-year sabbatical in 2017) which he showed in September 2019. “Our plans for the revamped site were on since then, and the pandemic made having a global touch-point all the more important,” he says.

On August 27, valaya.com went live once again with a renewed focus on e-commerce and an online ‘couture’ experience of customising the ‘Ika’ jacket. “Since then, it has been a journey of revelations,” says the couturier, adding that it has allowed him to dress brides from Nairobi and Sri Lanka in the past few weeks alone. “And this is when we haven’t even started advertising.”

Web tactics

A week later, Instagram was flooded with congratulatory posts from top Bollywood celebrities, stylists, and influencers from across the world, celebrating the launch of gauravguptastudio.com. This Insta-storm overloaded Gaurav Gupta’s new site on day one itself. “It also got us about 200 new orders within a week,” adds the designer. The smart thing he did was to announce immediate online discounts going up to 70%. This ensured traffic and conversions.

In return, the back-end team got a cache of invaluable data on which to base their next moves. While he admits that the initial rush of demand has plateaued — “which was expected” — the website is helping his five stores across the country by allowing interested customers to choose their preferences. They book appointments and visit the nearest store to buy the actual garments.

Brand building

For upcoming designer Kshitij Jalori, whose website went live on September 30, it was all about making his online retail experience as seamless as possible. “I wanted to cut out the clutter and focus on the clothes,” he says. Mehra says that young labels have the advantage of not needing to live up to brand expectations. “They can continue adding various services according to their specific learnings,” he offers.

In the end, it is a mix of three things that makes for a success story. According to Mehra: an easy, retail-oriented interface; solid social media outreach and advertising; and pricing that works for your product online.

While launching a website in itself guarantees nothing even at the best of times, it should by now be evident that having one is as essential as sewing labels onto the garments they produce. It takes an initial investment of ₹2 to 5 lakhs to start a website, on average (designers and developers are loath to share exact figures, though). And going by the recent bloom of website launches, it seems like an investment worth the name. Ongoing launches also shows that our designers aren’t sitting idle; that the business of selling clothes, on which millions depend for their livelihoods, will continue to thrive in the times to come.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/wooy3f/article32872525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rana-lead,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/the-importance-of-being-online/article32872527.ece
315,2020/10/16,How luxury retailers and designers are dealing directly with their clients online,"How luxury retailers and designers are seemingly less dependant on PR consultants and are dealing directly with their clients via IG Lives and WhatsApp consultations

In early September, Sabyasachi Mukherjee hosted an Instagram Live with Beth Armata, Manager - Fine and Designer Jewellery, at New York’s luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman. The virtual show featured staff in masks, modelling his 65-piece Haute Joaillerie collection (showcased exclusively at the store since January). The ace designer offered a running commentary — amount of gold, number of gemstones, cut, carat, colour — with the uncanny vibe of a late-night TV infomercial from the ’90s. The only differences? The medium, and an email ID instead of a toll-free number.

Haute couture labels rely on plush brick-and-mortar stores and touch-and-feel experiences to woo the luxury buyer. Before Covid-19 struck, social media was largely a playground for niche labels to build an audience base, market collections or drive sales of single products. Engaging audiences went beyond ‘Swipe up to win’. Even someone like Mukherjee, who regularly launches his collections on Instagram to over 4.5 million followers, admitted on-air that “it is very stressful”.

No trials, only shopping

Thirty two-year-old multi-designer boutique, Ensemble, launched their e-commerce portal in April, and their social media also saw a shift. Where executive director Tina Tahiliani Parikh had only occasionally appeared in photos with designers on their pre-lockdown Instagram feed, she was now going live with the likes of Anamika Khanna and Ruchika Sachdeva of Bodice. She is open to being part of the brand’s social media strategy. “It is a very personalised business, so whenever necessary, I’ll do it,” she says, adding that the reliance on PR consultants has reduced because you have a direct way to talk to your customer.

“A luxury experience depends on the salesperson’s customer knowledge and intimacy, product exclusivity, and the narrative behind it. The brands able to translate these values digitally will succeed,” says Parmesh Shahani, author of Queeristan and head, Godrej India Culture Lab. For now, it is a work in progress. Like Mumbai-based multi-brand luxury house Le Mill: when lockdown eased in August, they got in-house stylists to share fall classics and curate wardrobe staples under ₹50,000 — all from their store, of course.

Like, share, shop

Designers have been focussing on launching e-commerce portals, but continue to rely on social media to spread the word. Bridal couture studio Jade by Monica and Karishma offers virtual consultations by appointment. Simultaneously, they’ve started an IGTV series called ‘Jade Closet’, where designers give styling tips on everything from ruffle saris to lehengas.

Luxury sari labels, traditionally defined by a tactile approach, are also creating WhatsApp catalogues for virtual pop-ups and offering video call shopping, like Bengaluru-based heritage label The House of Angadi. “We discussed internally if it would take away from the physical experience of buying a handwoven kanjeevaram or Benarasi, but the connoisseur knows,” says Varun Rana, fashion commentator and Communications Director at the textile label.

Tech check

While Amazon’s livestream shopping function has videos by celebrity beauty brand founders such as Jessica Alba and Gabrielle Union, there has been a spurt of IG Lives closer home. Ogaan, a multi-brand store with branches in Mumbai, Delhi and Hyderabad, hosted Instagram Lives with designers Amrita Khanna and Gursi Singh of Lovebirds, and Rina Singh of Eka, showcasing their latest collections.

Elsewhere, designers are crowding Instagram and Facebook feeds with virtual launches, using Reels and AR filters to further their reach. If you head to jewellery designer Roma Narsinghani’s profile, you can try on her collection, including headpieces and septum rings, showcased at Helsinki Fashion Week via filters.

Arnab Samanta, marketing head at Graphixstory, says that his tech-led advertising studio has created beauty filters — including Sonam Kapoor’s Cannes look with metallic smoky eyes — for celebrity make-up artist Namrata Soni. “Brands like Gucci and Lacoste have used AR in the past but we’re yet to see interest from high-end Indian fashion labels,” he says.

Tell me a story

In this milieu, brands that tell relevant stories are able to break through the clutter. “Today, consumers aren’t only looking to buy a garment, accessory or a shoe. They need a product for a reason, with a reason. They need to be convinced of why they should be on your side,” says Shefalee Vasudev, editor, The Voice of Fashion. Glasgow-based Indian designer Ayush Kejriwal’s virtual campaign, titled Rakhwaali, showed silk-clad women multi-tasking at home: a comment on how gender identities govern domestic responsibilities and the burden on women in the lockdown. “Such innovative ideas rivet brands closer to the minds of a consumer. Luxury brands in India will have to find such messaging and storytelling, and do it well,” she adds.

Bigger brands could also take cues from niche labels like Srila Chatterjee’s Baro Market, that seems to have cracked the code. After shutting down her Mumbai-based lifestyle store during the pandemic, she launched an online marketplace of products by Indian craftspersons and artisans, telling their stories through an online magazine, newsletters and other media. “She doesn’t just send you a list of products, but tells you why it is best for you,” says Shahani. “So, when this is over, we will remember her authentic, personal connection. Will that translate into better business for Baro in future? Certainly,” he concludes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/javiqb/article32870908.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/faces,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/how-luxury-retailers-and-designers-are-dealing-directly-with-their-clients-online/article32870912.ece
316,2020/10/16,Online enterprise HasthaKatha weaves stories of Indian crafts and folk arts in western wear,"HasthaKatha’s range of handloom garments feature our country’s traditional art and craft

Dresses with a touch of Madhubani, jumpsuits with Gurjar embroidery, kantha-inspired wrap dresses and kalamkari scarves are the hallmark of HasthaKatha, an online enterprise launched by Ekta Jaiswal and Divya Lakshmi, alumni of National Institute of Fashion Designing, Hyderabad.

The four-year-old initiative, that aims at slow fashion, weaves Indian folk arts and textiles into western wear.

“Hastha means hand gesture; we want to tell stories through our handmade, customised handloom garments,” says Ekta, who wanted to launch her own label ever since her college days.

Brand idea

Ekta and Divya graduated in 2013 and joined the design team of Kalanjali, travelling Andhra Pradesh and exploring textiles and folk arts. The duo was also among 30 finalists selected for an online portal’s fashion incubator competition to present their brand ideas. “Since the online market was not established in 2015, we couldn’t go ahead with the ideas,” remembers Ekta, who moved to her hometown Delhi to work in an export house for a year before she shifted to fashion social network Soon, she decided to start something of her own.

“Instead of mass-produced garments, our goal is to promote slow fashion — “Jisko bannne mein time lagta hai, usko kharaad hone mein bhi time lagta hai (What takes time to make also takes time to be sold)” and give Indian crafts a place of pride. Indian craftsmanship is seen in saris and salwar suits but our focus is to showcase it on western wear,” says Ekta adding HasthaKatha’s customers are mostly from Etsy, the American e-commerce platform.

Divya lives in Hyderabad and has left the enterprise, but the duo is still “close friends”. Ekta has converted a part of her home into a workshop/studio. “I often visit hand embroiders, painters and block printers to get work done on my garments and scarves. I cannot afford to hire them given that I work within a small space, ” she says.

Talking about how she crafts her ensembles, Ekta shares, “I create garments from only cotton and linen, inspired by crafts and folk arts around me, but prefer light embellishments. A western top painted completely in kalamkari or Madhubani is too heavy for casual wear and becomes expensive too. Wearability and cost are essentials for the enterprise. Not all of my garments feature Indian crafts; some are just plain for those who like it simple.”

Her scarves are priced under ₹1,000 and jumpsuits and dresses start from ₹1,500 onwards. Speaking of sustainable fashion, she says she uses only buttons made of coconut or shells and not plastic or wood. “Plus, leftover fabric is converted into masks,” she elaborates. Ekta adds, “With minimal people involved in my enterprise, the Photoshop I learnt during college is helping me edit Instagrammable photos.”

Haritha Keralam Mission’s efforts to set up ‘green spots’ as part of the State-wide ‘Pachathuruthu’ (green islet) project have borne fruit in Kozhikode district with the support of various local bodies and youth movements. Project officials said, under the scheme, there were 117 green spots in the district, which were officially opened by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan through videoconferencing on Thursday.

Some of the green spots now nurture medicinal plants and fruit-bearing trees.

According to Corporation authorities, there are four such green spots within Kozhikode city limits. Two of them are inside the V.K. Krishna Menon Memorial Garden at Komeri. The green spots, realised with the support of the Ayyankali Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme in 2019 and 2020, were home to thousands of saplings and fruit plants, they added.

The completion of the four green spots was officially declared by Mayor Thottathil Raveendran here on Thursday. At the event, he received the official letter of commendation issued by the Haritha Keralam Mission for cooperating with the project. V.K.C. Mammad Koya, MLA, presented the letter to the Mayor.

323,2020/10/16,Celebrating World Food Day with 5 paise chicken biriyani,"During several occasions previously too, the shop - Mujib Biryani - has sold biriyani packets at a lower cost to emphasise social issues.

A biryani shop near Kamarajar Bus Stand here sold chicken biryani boxes for five paise on Friday to mark World Food Day.

K.Sheik Mujibur Rahman, the owner of ‘Mujib Biryani,’ said that by selling a half plate biryani for five paise, he aimed to create awareness of the importance to protect and preserve antiques. He said that the recent archaeological findings at Keeladi stirred an interest in him to understand history and to preserve artefacts.

During several occasions the shop sold biryani packets at a lower cost to emphasise on various social issues. This was the second consecutive year that the shop was selling chicken biryani packets for five paise.

Mr. Rahman said that biryani boxes were sold to around 500 people on Friday. “All safety precautionary norms issued by the government were strictly followed. All customers were seated on chairs that were placed wide apart. It was ensured that all customers wore face masks and the staff of the shop regulated the customers,” he said.

“The COVID-19 pandemic had financially pushed many families into starvation. Our group of friends distributed food packets to around 25,000 people during the lockdown period.

326,2020/10/16,"Poor patronage for Chennai-Madurai Tejas, a concern","Railway officials said that the patronage has been less than 15% of around 1,000 seats in the train on many days.

Chennai-Egmore-Madurai- Chennai Egmore Tejas Express has failed to get minimum patronage from passengers in view of the COVID-19 threat.

Railway officials said that the patronage has been less than 15% of around 1,000 seats in the train on many days. The premium train comprises 12 air-conditioned chair cars and one executive chair car. “This was a train that got an overwhelming patronage in the past and getting accommodation on many days was near impossible,” a travelling ticketing examiner said.

However, ever since the train services were resumed early this month after six months of lockdown, the all-AC coach train has got a negligible patronage.

“This is not an isolated case. Even all the overnight superfast express trains are running with many vacant berths in AC coaches though sleeper class coaches are getting full in weekends,” he added.

Southern Railway even changed timings of the Chennai Egmore-Madurai Tejas Express to enable people to reach the station on time to make up for the lack of adequate public transport facility in the early mornings.

When the officials conducted a survey among the travelling public for three days on October 9, 10 and 11, vast majority of the 206 passengers described the overall travel experience by Tejas as good, very good and excellent.

“Similarly, they gave top ratings on three important parameters like cooling in the AC coaches, their ambience and staff behaviour,” a senior official in Madurai Division said.

The official said that the poor patronage in Tejas could be due to the fear perception among the passengers to travel in AC coaches under the pandemic conditions.

More people have got used to travel by cars in the last few months during the absence of public transport as they feel car travels are safer. Besides, they could avoid using public transport vehicles like buses, metro trains and cabs during their stay outside home.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/8bp997/article32875210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA17TEJAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/poor-patronage-for-chennai-madurai-tejas-a-concern/article32875213.ece
327,2020/10/16,Convene all-party meet on reservation issue: CPI,"The State government should immediately convene an all-party meeting on the reservation issue for OBCs in medical colleges and a delegation from Tamil Nadu should meet the Prime Minister, said CPI state secretary R. Mutharasan here on Friday.

Speaking to reporters, he said that the affidavit filed by the Centre in the Supreme Court in this connection exposed the BJP’s stand against the OBCs. Already, the party had shown its true colours against the minorities. Now, they were keen to eliminate the role of OBCs in the administration, he claimed.

The State government had passed a resolution to accord 7.5 % reservation for the government school students in the medical seats. However, the Governor was sitting on it without giving his consent. This too was highly condemnable, Mr. Mutharasan charged and demanded Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami to act swiftly.

Though the foodgrain output was higher in T.N. this season, the government should open direct purchase centres. Failure or delay may force the farmers to sell their produce to the private merchants for a song, the CPI leader said.

Taking a dig at the style of functioning of Anna University Vice-Chancellor Surappa, he demanded stern action.

The farm acts passed in the Parliament in a hurried manner only reflected the BJP's hidden agenda. It was misleading the farmers that it would be a boon, but actually, the Act would be a bane to the poor ryots. The BJP was interested only in protecting the interests of some corporate houses, he said.

The BJP had made tall claims on the GST regime. However, the Finance Minister had given two plans to the States, to borrow funds. The CPI's stand on the GST had been vindicated now, Mr. Mutharasan said and added that the BJP was giving false representations in every sphere, which was dangerous to the nation's secular fabric.

The DMK front in TN, no doubt, would sweep the polls next May, he said and added that the allies were clear about their policies. Former CPI MLA Gunasekaran, district secretary Kannagi were also present.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/convene-all-party-meet-on-reservation-issue-cpi/article32875080.ece

Revenue Minister R. B. Udhayakumar held comprehensive discussion with the top officials of Zoho Corporation, a Chennai-headquartered software development company having its office near here, on expanding its operations in Tenkasi to give employment to rural youths.

Chief Executive Officer of Zoho Corporation Sridhar Vembu participated in the discussion along with his senior colleagues. Apart from Mr. Udhayakumar, Minister for Adi Dravid Welfare V. M. Rajalakshmi, Additional Chief Secretary, Hansraj Varma, Collectors G. K. Arun Sundar Thayalan of Tenkasi and T. G. Vinay of Madurai, MLAs Selva Mohandas Pandian of Tenkasi, A.

Zoho Corporation has already established its office at Maththalampaarai – Zoho Technologies Private Limited - near Old Courtallam.

Emerging from the meeting, Mr. Udhayakumar said the meeting with the top-brass of Zoho Corporation was conducted as the Chief Minister was keen on taking the software development firms to the rural areas in a bid to give employment to qualified rural youth after technically equipping them.

“While the migration of software technocrats to major cities in search of employment often leads to the change in their culture, the presence of these industries in the rural areas will conserve our culture intact. Moreover, the rural youth will get employment with decent salary in their places itself. Hence, we’re keen on ensuring more employment opportunities in the software industries by bringing these firms to the rural Tamil Nadu,” said Mr. Udhayakumar.

On the site to be selected for the construction of Tenkasi Collectorate, the Minister said it would come up at a place which would be easily accessible for the public from all parts of Tenkasi district.

In a statement, Collector R. Kannan said farmers should pay the price for the fertilizer mentioned on the bags and the payment should be made using the point of sale equipment. They need not pay anything more than the stipulated rate and they should get the receipt from the shops.

Stating that the Centre was giving around ₹1,110 subsidy for each bag of 45 kg of urea, he said farmers should buy the required quantity of urea based on the area of cultivation.

“Anyone buying urea disproportionate to the area of cultivation or the retail or wholesale merchants selling higher quantity of urea would be booked under Fertilizer Control Act 1985,” he said.

Mr. Kannan said farmers should use only the quantity of fertilizer prescribed on the soil health card. Thereby, they can avoid using higher quantity and prevent hoarding, shortage and irregularities in supply.

A total of 1,105 tonne of urea, 1,110 tonne of DAP, 893 tonne of MOP and 1,912 tonne of complex fertilizer have been kept at 21 wholesale shops, 134 retail shops, 184 primary agriculture cooperative credit societies to meet the requirement.

If any wholesale fertilizer merchant was found to have sold the fertilizer outside the district or transferred the subsidy-linked fertilizer to retail sellers or created an artificial demand for fertilizer, they would be tried against under Fertilizer Control Act 1985 and Essential Commodities Act 1955, the Collector said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/aadhar-must-to-buy-fertilizer/article32874411.ece
331,2020/10/16,Acting in a movie is an actor’s prerogative: BJP,"Acting in a movie is the prerogative of an actor, said BJP state vice-president Annamalai here on Friday.

Welcoming hundreds of cadres, who joined the BJP from other parties at a function, he told reporters that there was no need for any controversy regarding the Muttiah Muralidharan's biopic movie - 800, in which actor Vijay Sethupathi is playing the lead role.

Politicising or threatening someone emotionally should be discouraged. It was for Mr. Vijay Sethupathi to take a call on it and political parties or leaders should stay away, Mr. Annamalai opined.

On the utterances of actor Kushboo over the differently-abled people, he said that she had apologised. The people should take that and put an end to it there.

“People no longer believe that BJP is anti-minorities as large number of people from the minority segments were joining the party since 2019,” he pointed out.

The BJP in Tamil Nadu had bright chances of victory in as many as 65 Assembly constituencies and in Dindigul district, Palani constituency had a good chance for the BJP to emerge victorious, he said and added that only at the time of elections, talks of alliance would be finalised.

To another query on whether the BJP would contest in the Lok Sabha by-poll in Kanniyakumari, Mr. Annamalai said that it was for the high command and the TN unit to decide.

He said that every scheme announced by the Centre was useful for the common man. Unable to digest the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, some opponents were spreading rumours. It would all come to an end soon, he summed up.

332,2020/10/16,"Thatchanallur, Melapalayam zones to get SCADA system","₹24.30 crore sanctioned under the Smart City programme

The Corporation, in a bid to improve its existing drinking water supply system to the residents, has proposed to install SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system in Thatchanallur and Melapalayam zones on an outlay of ₹24.30 crore under the ongoing Centre-funded Smart City programme.

The proposed system would control distribution of drinking water from head works and service reservoirs to residents of Thatchanallur and Melapalayam zones even as this system is already in use in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai zones. The recently held meeting of the Board of Directors of Tirunelveli Smart City Limited with K. Bhaskaran, Chairman, approved these two projects. While ₹12.01 crore has been earmarked for the project meant for Thatchanallur Zone, ₹12.29 crore will be spent for Melapalayam Zone.

As all the four zones will get the SCADA system, an ‘Integrated Command and Control System’ will be established in the central office at a cost of ₹12.50 crore for integrating all the four SCADA systems.

“Apart from using this integrated system for controlling the four SCADA systems, it can be used for conserving energy in all corporation offices, street lights and used as a ‘war room’ during natural disasters and pandemic to evolve and execute strategies in the city within short notice,” said V. Narayanan Nair, Chief Executive Officer, Tirunelveli Smart City Limited.

Dr. Nair said several north Indian States, which have created this Integrated Command and Control System, are using it for their anti-COVID-19 operations very effectively.

The board granted its nod for the construction of a shopping mall near the Palayamkottai bus-stand at an estimated cost of ₹11.73 crore and a multi-level car parking near the Palayamkottai bus-stand at a cost of ₹12.82 crore even as the Palayamkottai bus terminus is under reconstruction.

“Since the quarters of the senior corporation officials and the bungalow of Deputy Mayor were very old, all these old structures have been demolished to give way for the shopping mall and the multi-level car parking,” he said.

Of the 2.40 acre in this area, the Palayamkottai bus-stand is on 1.10 acre and the quarters and the Deputy Mayor bungalow are situated on the remaining 1.30 acre. Hence, the 1.30 acre will be used for the shopping mall and the multi-level car parking.

“Within the shopping mall we are planning to have an exclusive zone for shops selling branded products and the other zone will be utilised for common purpose,” Dr. Nair said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/thatchanallur-melapalayam-zones-to-get-scada-system/article32874277.ece
333,2020/10/16,Sero surveillance study to be held in 38 clusters,"It will help to determine the extent of COVID-19 infection

Madurai

A sero surveillance study, which will help to determine the extent of COVID-19 infection in the population, will be conducted at 38 clusters in the district from next week.

Deputy Director of Health Services K.V. Arjun Kumar said that the survey, which will begin on a pilot basis from next week, will continue for three weeks.

The main aim of this state-wide survey is to understand how many in the general population have been infected with COVID-19 and have become immune to the virus. It also helps to understand the pattern of transmission in the community and to determine the fraction of asymptomatic or sub-clinical infections present in the community.

Out of the 38 total clusters identified in the district, 20 clusters are in the rural areas and the remaining 18 falls within Madurai Corporation limits. Parts of Anaiyur, Alwarpuram, Anna Nagar, Harveypatti, Jaihindpuram, Narimedu, Tamil Sangam Road, Tirunagar, Thirumangalam, Alanganallur, Paravai, Sholavandan, T. Kallupatti and Usilampatti are some of the areas where clusters have been identified for the survey.

An official from the health department said that a separate micro plan has been created and samples will be lifted from 30 adults in each cluster. The participants for the survey will be selected from each household through a scientific methodology and it can include those who have tested positive for COVID-19 or those who have tested negative for COVID-19.

Each participant will have to fill a questionnaire and venous blood samples will be lifted from each participant. “The blood sample will help to ascertain the anti-body levels that were produced against the COVID-19 infection,” said the official.

Mr. Arjun Kumar said that the samples that are lifted will be tested through chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) method. A CLIA machine has been installed at Samayanallur Primary Health Centre to test samples lifted for sero-survey from Madurai, Dindigul, Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga, Theni and Pudukkottai districts, he added.

336,2020/10/16,Tirunelveli stares at 46% rain deficit,"‘The district should have received about 495 mm of rainfall between January and October’

The district with an annual average rainfall of 814.80 mm had actually experienced only 267.98 mm rainfall between January and October this year which was 46% below the average, said Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Saitsh here on Friday. She pointed out that during the period, the district should have actually received about 495 mm of rainfall.

After a gap of six months, the farmers’ grievance redressal meet was conducted online due to COVID-19 pandemic.

The reservoirs – Papanasam, Servalar, Manimuthar, Vadakku Pachchaiyar, Kodumudiyar and Nambiyar – had only about 42.60% water (5,500.13 million cubic feet against the total 12,882 mcft), which was 34.20% in the corresponding period last year. The district, which would get an average rainfall of 166 mm in October (it was 261.11 mm in 2019), has so far received only 20.28 mm rainfall.

Of the 740 system tanks in the district, 695 tanks are bone-dry and all 550 rain-fed tanks are also dry. Only five of the 740 system tanks have water, sufficient for irrigation for two months.

Though, the southwest monsoon had failed to bring much rain, farmers had raised paddy on 5,082 hectare, cereals on 249 ha, grams on 921 ha, cotton on 636 ha, sugarcane on 33 ha and oilseeds on 273 ha, with the water available in dams and from wells in rain-fed areas.

Anticipating normal rainfall during the northeast monsoon this year, certified seeds, chemical fertilizers, bio-fertilizers, pesticides etc. had been stocked adequately and periodic checking was being conducted in the shops of the authorised dealers dealing with these agro inputs to check the quality of these products. Due actions were also being taken against traders dealing with substandard agro inputs.

When inspections revealed the sale of substandard seeds in three shops, the sale ban was imposed on 1.62 tonnes of seeds, worth about ₹1.60 lakh.

Under the Central assistance, 100% subsidy was being given to small and marginal farmers practising micro irrigation techniques while this grant was 75% for other agriculturists. As the district had received ₹10.68 crore during this fiscal under this component for installing micro irrigation systems in 2,500 hectare, the farmers should make use of it to irrigate their crops such as groundnut, coconut, oil palm, cotton etc., Ms. Shilpa said.

Farmers who want to avail the grant for installing micro irrigation gadgets should upload the Aadhar card, ‘adangal’, map, computer ‘chitta’ in www.tnhorticulture.tn.gov.in/ horti/mimis.

When the farmers said there was demand for urea in several parts of the district, the Collector assured that the chemical nutrient would be available on time as the district had started receiving its share of urea.

The farmers also appealed to take steps for ensuring early disbursal of crop insurance benefits for 2016-17 even though they had paid the premium before the deadline.

338,2020/10/16,Remittances growth turning muted: report,"Remittances growth is muted due to “structural” reasons which will hamper consumption demand locally, a report said on October 15.

”...the muted external remittances growth is more of a structural issue than transitory,” India Ratings and Research said in its note.

India has been the largest recipient of remittances from its diaspora spread all across the world and received over $70 billion inflows last year.

The agency argued that flows had started to moderate even before the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, pointing out that as a percentage of gross disposable income, the share of remittances fell to 2.5 per cent in FY19 as against 3.5 per cent in FY10.

Foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) segment has witnessed a year-on-year fall in deposits, whereas overall NRI (non-resident Indians) accounts have reported an increase, it said, adding that South-based Federal Bank and South Indian Bank have reported subdued growth in NRI deposits.

Key risk for banks will emerge only if the fall in deposits continues amid an increase in withdrawals due to the factors induced by pandemic.

At the same time, banks will be able to manage this risk better with the help of improved domestic deposits amid muted credit growth, it said.

The impact of this would largely be restricted to the aggregate consumption level as the buoyancy in foreign capital flows would compensate the requirement of capital, it noted.

Income generation abroad by the diaspora is the biggest source of remittances, and the Gulf countries are the largest source of fund inflows, it said, pointing out to World Bank data which says over half of the 16 million diaspora is in the Middle East.

“The falling oil prices and recessionary pressures exacerbated due to the COVID-19 outbreak have led to job losses and salary cuts globally,” it said, adding remittances from the Gulf region will be pressured due to COVID-19 related factors coupled with falling oil prices.

Various empirical studies have suggested that remittances are an important driver of a smooth consumption cycle, have a positive impact on household savings and act as a consumption booster.

Therefore, the pandemic-led slowdown in consumption is likely to get exacerbated by the muted remittance flows, it added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/nb4ae4/article26777816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/rupeejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/remittances-growth-turning-muted-report/article32865530.ece

340,2020/10/16,Farm sentiment stays positive: ICRA,"Rains, Kharif prospects spur optimism

Farm sentiment remained buoyant, driven by a healthy monsoon and further optimism of a good Kharif crop despite the COVID-19 pandemic, ratings agency ICRA said in a report.

Rural household incomes stayed resilient, supported by healthy farm cash flows across regions and aided by high levels of Rabi procurement under various government schemes after a bumper Rabi harvest, it added.

Besides, increased government support, via the likes of MNREGA and PM-KISAN, had helped create employment and easing liquidity pressure on rural incomes, brought about by large-scale reverse migration to rural areas during lockdown, the agency said.

Shamsher Dewan, VP, ICRA, said though there were fears of disruption in the Rabi procurement process, the same was “mitigated by prompt lifting of restrictions by the Centre for agricultural activities”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/d1rv/article32876407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17BUPADDYKHARIF,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/farm-sentiment-stays-positive-icra/article32876408.ece

342,2020/10/16,‘Import ban on ACs won’t impact major players’,"‘It will help boost exports, create jobs’

The government’s move to ban import of air conditioners with refrigerants is unlikely to impact major players, who mostly import components, industry players said. On the other hand, it would help create jobs and increase exports, they added.

The move is consistent with the government’s twin objective of making India fully self-reliant in manufacturing ACs air conditioners and capturing a greater share of the global AC market through exports, Kamal Nandi, president of Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association, and business head & EVP, Godrej Appliances, said.

“The decision will boost AC manufacturing in India and create more jobs,” he said adding that currently, about 30% of air conditioners are imported into India as completely built-up units.

As per a CEAMA-Frost & Sullivan report, the market for household ACs stood at 6.5 million in 2019, and is estimated to grow to 16 million units by 2025. The industry presently employs over 62,000 people directly and about 1.20 lakh indirectly.

The statement follows the government’s decision to ban imports of air conditioners with refrigerants with a view to promote domestic manufacturing and cut imports of non-essential items.

Mr. Nandi pointed out that India has one of the lowest penetrations of ACs in the world at 5%, while also pitching for a lower GST slab of 18% for ACs, from 28%.

Global research firm Jefferies said in a note that top seven players, accounting for 90% of the market, should not be impacted by the move as they primarily import compressors/refrigerants versus the entire unit. Smaller brands and labels, however, who account for less than 10% of the market and possibly import the entire unit are likely to be affected.

It estimated the financial impact of the ban at the upper limit ₹3,600 crore. “Directorate General of Foreign Trade data indicates that overall imports of these product codes was ₹36 billion in FY20. AC with refrigerants is likely to be the bulk of this based on the description. Value implies less than 15% of the overall AC industry size in India,” it said.

Manish Sharma, president and CEO, Panasonic India South Asia, said Panasonic had set up its AC factory in 2012 in Haryana and has been manufacturing 100% in India. “We currently export ACs from India to SAARC, Middle East and Africa. Recently, we also announced our intention to share Panasonic’s manufacturing technology and help select companies manufacture Refrigerators and Air Conditioners reducing dependency on imports and driving the Make in India agenda,” he said.

Anil Rai Gupta, CMD at Havells India, said that the decision was in line with the Aatmanirbhar Bharat vision and the companies that had invested in their own manufacturing facility would be well-placed to benefit from it.” Lloyd air conditioners are now being manufactured in-house at our new state-of-the-art plant developed with an investment of around ₹400 crore, which is amongst the most integrated and modern facilities in Asia.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/95vjzg/article32876393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17BU-AIR-CONDITIONER,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/import-ban-on-acs-wont-impact-major-players/article32876394.ece

As a first step towards re-entry into the segment where it made waves before Chinese phones took over, Micromax Informatics on Friday unveiled a sub brand ‘in’, under which it will roll out a range of smartphones.

“Our endeavour is to bring India on the global smartphone map again with 'in' mobiles,” co-founder Rahul Sharma said, while launching the sub-brand on the company’s digital handles.

Setting the backdrop for the comeback is the anti-China sentiment, in the wake of recent tension between India and China, as well as the Centre’s emphasis on ‘Make in India’.Towards realising its vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the government had announced production linked incentives (PLI) to spur domestic manufacturing of mobile phones.

“India is one the top five mobile gaming markets in the world and with the ‘in’ brand we will provide a bona fide choice that will allow consumers to edge ahead with high performance oriented products, without infringing on their privacy,” Mr. Sharma said.

Micromax has manufacturing facilities in Bhiwadi and Hyderabad. A release said the firm had a 2-million-phones-a-month capacity and is working on strengthening its retail and distribution network.

346,2020/10/16,Goibibo gets flak from passengers over refund of air tickets booked during lockdown,"Cash refunds possible when airlines return money, says portal.

Travel booking portal Goibibo, a company owned by MakeMyTrip, has become the target of social media outrage by many air travellers unable to receive either their refunds for flights cancelled due to COVID-19 or customer care support despite a recent order by the Supreme Court.

Sanchita Chandar, a Bangalore-based dentist, had booked a return journey to Kathmandu for April to volunteer as a health worker through the portal. Six months on, she is yet to receive ₹18,500 for flights booked on IndiGo and Royal Nepal Airline.

The Supreme Court ordered on October 1 that domestic airlines will have to refund tickets booked during the lockdown for travel during the freeze and credit shells may be issued by airlines if tickets were booked before the lockdown. However, passengers say that in cases where airlines have issued a full refund, Goibibo has not passed on the benefit.

The travel portal and other travel agents say that airlines have not been giving cash refunds to them in many cases but issuing only credit shells, while expecting that agents will issue cash refunds to passengers.

‘No accountability’

“IndiGo has told me that they have approved my cancellation and that it has sent the refund of ₹12,000 to Goibibo, through which I had made the booking. On the latter’s website, it shows that the refund has been processed and that it should be reflecting in my account, but that is yet to happen,” explains the 28-year-old dentist.

“They have no customer support and all phone calls elicit a pre-recorded response; there is no e-mail address I can write to or even a chat bot which can answer my queries. Twitter is the only medium through which I received a response, only after tagging a journalist. There is absolutely no accountability,” Dr. Chandar added.

In one of the recent exchanges reviewed by The Hindu, Goibibo told Dr. Chandar on September 28 that the ticket cost will be deposited to her bank account by October 4. But 12 days later, there is no sign of the cash transfer.

In response to a query by this correspondent, a spokesperson for MakeMyTrip, which owns Goibibo, said, “We have refunded the money wherever refunds have been issued by our airline partners and we are offering booking on platform through credit shells wherever the airlines have released the refunds through credit shell. As always, we continue to work closely with our airline partners to seamlessly pass on the benefits to our customers through the mode offered by the airlines.”

Another Kochi-based doctor, who did not want to be identified, is yet to receive ₹2 lakh she spent on booking a flight for two from Kochi to Vancouver for May 2 with Air Canada. The flight was booked on March 4, and following travel restrictions imposed by India and around the world, the couple was informed on April 4 that “your booking has been cancelled with full refund” and that they don’t have to follow up any more. The airline, too, informed them that all requests for refunds will have to be made to the travel agent through whom the booking was made.

But the lady doctor was shocked to receive a message on October 13, when Goibibo informed her that she will have to contact Air Canada for her refund request and that this was the “final solution” being offered to her. Both passengers were also offered credit shells by Goibibo in lieu of a cash refund, but the doctor from Kerala said that the conditions imposed on claiming these credit shells are prohibitive – “we can’t change the airport of origin, we can’t transfer the amount to a third person, and we must book with the same airline.”

“Airline and travel agency playing games with customers! @flyspicejet claims they have transferred full refund to @goibibo who claim they only have a credit shell. One or both are lying and trying to defeat SC order,” tweeted Soumitra Pathare, a well-known psychiatrist.

The court order recognised the contract between passengers and airlines and offered both parties partial relief, but travel agents were left unhappy. The order allows airlines to issue credit shells where purchases were made by travel agents, while the latter are expected to issue cash refunds to passengers.

An owner of a travel portal explained the issue on the condition of anonymity. “After the SC order, there have been tens of thousands of requests for refunds. A travel agent has to process refunds worth crores at once, but there is inadequate cash inflow as sales haven’t kept pace. At the same time, airlines have not issued cash refunds to travel agents, but only given digital money or credit shells.

The parent company, MakeMyTrip, it is learnt, too has been issuing digital wallets but its customers are not complaining as the facility has been offered by the website for several years and its patrons use it habitually.

“The agents fraternity needed cash refunds. We the travel agents have become financiers for the airlines,” said a press statement from the Travel Agents Association of India on the Supreme Court judgment.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/q91457/article32522905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BL05AIRLINEMASK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/goibibo-gets-flak-from-passengers-over-refund-of-air-tickets-booked-during-lockdown/article32872048.ece
347,2020/10/16,"After petrol, diesel demand returns to pre-COVID-19 levels","This is the first annual increase in sales of diesel since the nation imposed lockdown in late March

After petrol, diesel demand has returned to pre-COVID-19 levels as sales rose 8.8 % in the first half of October from a year ago, preliminary industry data showed.

This is the first annual increase in sales of diesel - the most consumed fuel in the country - since the nation imposed lockdown in late March to curb the spread of the pandemic.

While demand for petrol has been more resilient than diesel due to an increased preference for using personal vehicles instead of public transport to follow distancing norms, October 1-15 sales number showed better than anticipated recovery.

A pent-up demand and the upcoming festive season was expected to support fuel sales but even before that diesel sales rose to 2.65 million tonnes in the first fortnight of October from 2.43 million tonne a year back and 2.13 million tonne in the first half of September.

Petrol, which had returned to pre-COVID levels last month, posted a 1.5 % rise in sales to 982,000 tonne in the first half of October, up from 967,000 tonne in the same period a year back and 968,000 tonne in the first fortnight of September.

India witnessed unprecedented demand destruction after a nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25. Oil demand fell by as much as 49 % in April.

With the easing of restrictions and reopening of the economy, fuel demand recovered sharply in June from April before slowing due to the reimposition of restrictions in certain cities because of coronavirus and flooding in some regions.

It started to climb back again in September. Even in September, diesel had shown a month-on-month increase.

On Thursday, Shrikant Madhav Vaidya, Chairman of Indian Oil Corp - the nation’s biggest oil firm, had stated that September recovery was faster than expected.

But aviation turbine fuel (ATF) sales continue to be way below normal as airlines are yet to resume full services.

ATF sales fell 57 % to 135,000 tonne in the first half of October from a year ago but was 2.5 % higher than 130,000 tonne sold in the first fortnight of September.

“We see (oil) demand picking up this quarter (October-December) and by the end of the current financial year (March 2021), we should be back to pre-COVID levels,” Mr. Vaidya had said.

Petrol sales had climbed rapidly because personal mobility was being preferred leading to more private cars on the road. But in the case of diesel, consumption sectors like school buses and public transport were at a very subdued level.

Industry sources said while the Indian economy has started to pick up with lockdown restrictions being lifted since June, local lockdowns by states have hampered the demand quickly picking up.

Cooking gas LPG sales at 1.16 million tonne during October 1-15 were up 7 % year-on-year and 3 % month-on-month.

Two-wheeler sales grew 11.64% to over 18.49 lakh units as against over 16.56 lakh units in the same month last year. Data showed a year-on-year growth of 17.30% for motorcycles to over 12.24 lakh units and a marginal increase in sales of scooters at about 5.56 lakh units.

Kenichi Ayukawa, SIAM president, said that the Indian automotive industry was working hard amidst the tough COVID-19 situation to increase production and sales, while ensuring the safety of customers and employees across the whole value chain.

“In quarter-2 some segments have shown signs of recovery. Passenger vehicles and two-wheelers are positive, although on a very low base of previous year. We are expecting good demand in the festive season starting tomorrow,” he said, adding that thanks to the government intervention, auto loan interest rates are below 8%, the lowest in a decade, and that should encourage customers to purchase new vehicles.

Three-wheeler sales in the last month continued to be in the negative zone, nosediving nearly 72% to 18,640 units in September 2020 as against 66,362 units in the year-ago month.

Rajesh Menon, SIAM Director General, said “...in the quarter, July-September 2020, passenger vehicles grew by 17.02%, two-wheelers grew by 0.17%, three-wheelers saw a de-growth of 74.63%...compared to the same Quarter in 2019.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/aun4yy/article32869962.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDMARUTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/passenger-vehicle-wholesale-sales-increased-during-last-month-says-siam/article32869963.ece

Hey there, and welcome back to Clued In!

There really is no substitute for good old hard work. Whether you’re interested in building brawn or building brain. With both, really.

Muscles involve fibres that are strengthened with repetitive discipline. Neurons involve fibres that are fortified with repeated reinforcement.

Same with Cryptic Crosswords, really.

The Hindu Cryptic #13067 | Dr. X | 7 Down CLUE: Start to powerfully run, overcoming spasm in training (8) Clue types : Letter-pick, containment Definition : training Answer : PRACTICE Clue explained: We need an 8-letter word here. We should start by looking for potential synomyms for the words/phrases on either side of the clue, because #DEFINITIONISONEITHERSIDE. The definition could be ‘start’, or ‘training’, or ‘start to’. or ‘in training’, or ‘spasm in training’, or even ‘start to powerfully run’. Don’t overcrowd your mind with all the possible definitions. Just keep them in the back of your head, and quickly start to narrow down likely candidates given the word length. Also, if you already have some letter/s filled in in the grid, make use of it to home in on the likely definition. It’s all a give-and-take. Just like when in a relationship. ‘Start to powerfully’ could very likely mean the first letter of ‘powerfully’, which is a P. Another word for ‘run’ is RACE. Another word for ‘spasm’ is TIC, as in the muscular twitch you may feel when you’re nervous about something. If P + RACE is ‘overcoming’ TIC, you have PRACTICE. And PRACTICE, btw, is your 8-letter word for ‘training’!

355,2020/10/16,Should the government regulate TRPs?,"Though the government can facilitate the process, it should be the industry that regulates TRPs

Last week, the Mumbai Police said that a TRP (Target Rating Points) racket involving three news channels had been busted. Since then, the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), which monitors the TRPs, has suspended ratings of news channels for three months. The alleged scam has once again highlighted the need for regulation. Television channels are driven by TRPs and it is viewership that drives their business. In a conversation moderated by Anuradha Raman, S.Y. Quraishi (a former Chief Election Commissioner and former Director General of Doordarshan) and Sashi Kumar (the founder and editor in chief of Asiaville, a digital multimedia platform) discuss how TRPs are manipulated and what could be the solution. Edited excerpts:

Mr. Quraishi, you wrote recently that manipulating TRPs is not only a financial scam but also morally and ethically wrong. Could you elaborate on that?

S.Y. Quraishi: Viewership generates advertisement spending of nearly ₹27,000 crore. Now, every channel from Doordarshan (DD) to the private channels are eyeing the pie. This kitty should be distributed honestly. And that is where the dishonesty comes through TRPs. The financial fraud, which has been highlighted by the Mumbai Police Commissioner, is one aspect. Now because of that cheating, the channels’ ratings are getting distorted. That is the other aspect. Channels are spreading a hate narrative which is violative of the fundamental right of the citizen to know the truth through the media. The media has become a source of disinformation. And that is the ethical issue. Both dimensions, legal and ethical, are equally serious. What is now being investigated is the financial fraud, which is good enough. We should get to the bottom of the problem.

Mr. Sashi Kumar, as the founder of Asianet, were you bothered by the menace of TRPs?

Sashi Kumar: Yes, certainly. When you are running a private channel, TRPs are in your face. In the early 1990s, when private channels started, we didn’t have people’s meters. We didn’t have the modern, so-called sophisticated systems of verifying who was watching what. We had the diary method. You gave diaries to people and found out what they were watching during the week. That was inadequate and the sampling size was also very small. It was an unscientific method, but the only method and we used that. Advertisers used that along with their own common sense and what their people on the ground — agents, retailers, sellers of consumer durables — told them about the claims of a particular channel and the kind of viewership it was talking about.

Today I think it’s only a difference of degree, not of kind. We still have the same small sampling size for the huge ecosystem of TV viewership that we were introduced to at the beginning. Now, 44,000 homes is the sampling size of BARC. The sample size of Mumbai, which is in the eye of the storm of this TRP fiasco, is only about 2,000 homes, and Mumbai is the biggest TV viewing metropolis in the country. The sample of 2,000 homes is woefully inadequate and distorted. And as Mr. Quraishi said, the problem with this competition for TRPs is that there’s a race to the bottom and therefore, you find people insulting each other, insulting people, doing anything to attract attention. We have ample evidence of this, particularly in the context of the Sushant Singh Rajput case and how it was covered. I think this whole TRP dispute is a sequel to that. It’s a ratings mindset. This ratings mindset has taken over us.

This is not peculiar to television. If you go to a bookshop these days, there is somebody who has already rated the first top-selling 50 books. There is somebody who’s rated the top-selling music. Who’s doing this? There is no transparency in who is rating this. We are therefore limited to choosing from what has already been rated for us. Our intellectual horizons are shrinking, not expanding. And therefore, there’s something very distorted in this process of the ratings mindset and television is a good example we have of that.

The Hindu Explains | TRP and its loopholes

Would you like to weigh in on what Mr. Quraishi said, which is the right of the people to be informed? That the TRP race is not just a financial fraud, but also is also morally and ethically wrong?

Sashi Kumar: Certainly. The role of TV news is to create an informed citizenry which makes for a better, more mature democracy. The duty to inform should be an equivalent duty. Is that what we are getting on TV news? That is a big question mark. TRPs can be deceptive. For example, DD is the biggest act in town. And as recently as April-May this year, BARC itself admitted that DD has the highest reach, demographically and geographically, but it doesn’t get a proportionate share of the advertising revenue because advertising goes by another calculation, which is your purchasing power. So, the advertiser goes for that segment which has better purchasing power, which is why this small sliver of the English news channels, which incidentally account for less than 1% of total TV viewership, and each of these channels, which will be 0.4% of that 1% TV viewing ecosystem, is fighting for the advertisement pie. So, they need these TRP ratings far more than the entertainment channels. The pie is very small. And so the circus every night on these channels.

Comment | The tyranny of TRPs

The scam, as we are calling it now, is nothing new. AC Nielsen-owned TAM was in the news back in 2003-04 when allegations of viewership being rigged surfaced. TAM was dissolved and BARC took its place. It would seem that nothing has really changed.

S.Y. Quraishi: Yes. People meter is the key to understanding the problem, as the entire system of viewership is based on this. Unfortunately, nobody seems to know how it works. When I was in DD, we realised that despite 50% of the country being dependent only on terrestrial network, which meant that half of India was watching only DD, TAM showed us as a shareholder of only 2% of the audience. As a result, the advertisement revenue was assigned to only 2%, which was a fraud.

I asked TAM to install a meter on my official TV. The people meter is operated by a remote control with buttons assigned to every member of the family. They are expected to switch on the button when they are watching a channel and switch it off when they step out of the viewing room. Who is going to do this day after day? The technician who had come to install a people meter admitted after some hesitation that they paid the household in kind: a dinner set for one family, a TV set for another, with a request to watch a channel. Who are the buyers of these products for whom advertisers advertise the Mercedes cars and BMWs? And where are the people meters installed? In poor people’s homes. They are the ones who can be bought over by a pressure cooker and a TV set. So, despite a socioeconomic classification of households on the lines of ABCD and E, the top three segments from A to C will not install a people meter in their homes for ₹500 and ₹1,000 a month. To my mind the cheating was inbuilt into the system. The same people meter continues, only the owner has changed from TAM to BARC. Two years ago, there was a similar scam unearthed in Gwalior.

Would we achieve anything if we increased the sample size?

Sashi Kumar: Increasing the sample size is a first step. But equally important is to get the demographic right so that it is truly representative. As I understand it, BARC pays something like ₹100 to ₹200 to households (a month) where the people meters are installed. And so these households obviously have a particular economic status. There’s a uniformity about it. They are not representative of the TV viewing public, particularly for an English news channel. It is distorted. It’s not just the sampling size. It’s the methodology, the quality of sampling, the geographic and demographic spread.

How should the industry be regulated and who should regulate it? BARC viewership ratings haven’t really addressed the problem.

S.Y. Quraishi: I had put this question to advertisers in my meeting many years ago. This was in the context of TAM being accused of rigging viewership. Namely, this is your money and all of us are interested in your money. So, what precautions are you taking? They said, we have to go by some statistic, some audience figures. Let me also remind you that before TAM became a monopoly, there used to be INTAM, and every week, they would give diametrically opposite viewership figures. TAM bought over INTAM and said, now instead of two currencies there will be one currency. To my mind this was nothing more than cartelisation. Let there be four or five agencies in the same city. They will come up with different figures. And let us aggregate the figures coming from four or five different agencies. Probably, we will get to the truth.

What is wrong with a single currency? We are talking of one nation, one vote, one GST, etc.

Sashi Kumar: Everybody’s vying for the same small sliver of the pie of advertising spend. So, I think it’s a good idea to have checks and balances, to have, say, competing agencies which are professional, so that the industry can then decide which agencies’ figures it wants to follow. There should be some oversight too. For instance, in 2017 BARC had set up an independent disciplinary committee, headed by the retired judge, Justice Mukul Mudgal. Over the next two years, they got about 18 to 20 cases referred to that committee. So, there should be also an oversight committee with teeth. It’s important because the industry is going through a big shift. Already, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India has notified a new tariff order where customers can choose channels they want to watch. The people meters have not adapted to reflect these big shifts that have taken place. And if it’s not up to date, it gets distorted. This case of rigging households really affects the medium, smaller players, and the regional media players. I think it makes for a different kind of cartelisation through a corrupt mode. Therefore, these measures must come in to correct the situation. Otherwise, the losers are not just the advertisers. The losers are also the consumers because consumers have a right to be informed. There’s a larger public interest in this and it’s not just something that the industry can incestuously decide for itself.

Should the government get into the business of regulation?

Sashi Kumar: I wouldn’t say the government should step into any such role to regulate the media. It has to be an autonomous body. It has to be the industry, as it’s in the interest of the industry. It’s in the interest of those who are spending ₹25,000 crore or ₹27,000 crore on advertising to make sure that it is cost effective.

S.Y. Quraishi: There’s no question of government regulation, but at the same time, the government can facilitate the process. Maybe the government can pass a law that any violation will face a legal action, criminal action. The government can play an honest broker, but it has to be industry run, it has to be self-regulation and at the same time an independent regulation. Can’t the industry come up with a good, technically foolproof solution? They only have to sit together and apply their mind.

356,2020/10/16,The importance of building trust,"Being unprepared for an assignment can land a journalist in big trouble

The district of Visakhapatnam, and especially the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha border region, is densely forested and filled with water bodies. As a result, it is a difficult one to traverse. There is no access to these areas; only long treks can get you there. There is no cell phone connectivity in most parts of the 11 Adivasi mandals of the district. Malaria is a common disease in these areas and getting drinking water is a big challenge. Without gaining the trust of the Adivasis, a journalist covering the Maoist problem in the region can not only get lost easily in the jungle but also fall sick.

The Adivasis, who are often caught between the police and the Maoists, are naturally suspicious of questions and conversations. They wonder whether people who want to interview them are actually officers from the Intelligence Wing of the police who have come to gather information about the ‘Annas’ (elder brothers, as the Maoists are called), or are Maoists who have come to recruit them. If journalists pose questions, they pose as many in return. They only open up once they are satisfied that the journalist is neither a police officer nor a Maoist.

Some years ago, during a visit to Ramaguda, the photographer and I did not do our homework of networking with local reporters. We were covering a fact-finding mission of the Human Rights Forum after an encounter between the elite anti-Naxal force of Andhra Pradesh, the Greyhounds, and the Maoists. The encounter took place on October 24, 2016 at Ramaguda, a remote village. More than 30 Maoists, including some top leaders, were killed in the incident.

We visited the site about four days after the encounter. We travelled till a village called Beijingi in a vehicle after which we set out on foot to the site. We made our way through the forest for two hours until we finally came across a man carrying firewood. We asked him about the encounter site. He did not understand our tongue and we did not comprehend his. But he understood our query from our gestures. He looked at us suspiciously and then gave us some directions.

We learnt over the next couple of hours how unprepared we were. The man who had sized us up had directed us the wrong way. We wandered about aimlessly in the heat until we reached an Adivasi hamlet. We were exhausted. We sat down in the village square and asked for some water, though we had brought bottles of water with us. Past experience had taught us that there is no better way of gaining the confidence of the Adivasis than sitting cross-legged on the porch of their homes, requesting them for some water and food, and chatting for a while.

We finally got our bearings right, but only after trekking for about 10 km in the wrong direction. Though the 15-km distance from Beijingi to Ramaguda that day stretched to 25 km, we reached the spot and completed our work. But we learnt an important lesson that day: always reach villages a day earlier if you’re on an assignment, interact a lot with the locals, and build trust. Only trust can yield good reports. And only through trust can you avoid getting lost in difficult, unfamiliar terrain.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/go3xge/article19908443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Greyhounds,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-importance-of-building-trust/article32864812.ece
357,2020/10/16,Bollywood’s moment of reckoning?,"The industry has shown a united front because its interests are being compromised

The Hindi film industry, or Bollywood as it is popularly known, has finally woken up. To counter the smear campaign launched by certain news channels to tarnish its image and invade the privacy of its leading actors, several producers and actors have filed a lawsuit in the Delhi High Court. This suit has been filed against two English news channels and their star anchors to restrain them from attributing certain terms and behaviour to the industry and people involved with its functioning.

A new soap opera

The campaign launched by these news channels with unsubstantiated claims has been derogatory and disrespectful to say the least. It is nothing less than the grotesque soap operas that play on several Indian channels every evening. Many of these serials are derived from or try to mimic the iconography and vocabulary of similar Hindi films. Television news in contemporary India is often the new soap opera where willing suspension of disbelief is its raison d’être.

The campaign that has irked and damaged the image of Bollywood and angered its leading players is a result of the ongoing controversy over Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. It was a well-designed campaign to divert attention from pressing issues at hand and other raging debates in the country such as the farmers’ agitation, the citizenship debate, the COVID-19 pandemic, the rights of migrant labourers, women’s safety and the killing of Dalits, and focus on the untimely and unfortunate death of a promising actor who did not belong to the power cliques of Mumbai.

These news channels thus found the perfect plot to be developed across months of prime-time television news where a young actor’s aspirations are “crushed” by a powerful Bollywood lobby. This is the same powerful-powerless binary that Hindi cinema has sold to us for decades without delving deep into the power structures of society.

When these news channels found very little to link their dubious claims with the death of the actor, the focus of these shows turned to some big names, their apparently amorous lifestyle and purported villainy.

Comment | Bollywood’s many maladies

It is easy to attribute qualities to the film industry about which very little is known. Even the little we do know about the lives of filmstars and the rumours and gossip pertaining to their films is often the handiwork of their PR machinery for visibility of their films. Hindi cinema by itself is responsible for furthering the myth about the industry. It needs more transparency in its dealings to counter such an image.

Others joined the nepotism debate blaming certain industry children, or ‘star kids’, for being favoured and privileged over outsiders. The campaign was relentless and malicious.

Editorial | Something rotten: On Sushant Singh Rajput death and the media mob

Perhaps there’s no antecedent to an event like this in the history of independent India when an entire industry with enormous soft power has been vilified by some news channels to serve their narrow gains. Also Bollywood is a big draw to win the TRP race. Unsuspecting audiences believe that the news channels are on the path of satyagraha to perform an act of cleansing.

Reason for protest

Bollywood’s collective action to expose the fake media trial is welcome. The industry has shown a united front because its interests are being compromised. The news campaign might have an effect on the movie business leading to the boycott of certain films. This collective outburst shouldn’t be misconstrued as a unified condemnation of the quality and health of television news in the country. It is a protest to ensure that Bollywood’s economic interests aren’t undermined.

Further action should lead to boycott of film awards and magazines that belong to the same media conglomerate that also owns one of these news channels engaged in spewing venom against the industry. While there may not be a radical shift in Bollywood, we certainly hope that this intervention will help to reduce the toxicity of some news channels and their anchors if not obliterate it.

358,2020/10/16,Dealing with a deluge: On Hyderabad floods,"As floods swamp Hyderabad, the focus is on the inadequacy of drainage infrastructure

A deep monsoon depression over the west central Bay of Bengal, which weakened as it moved over Telangana, resulted in downpours over several districts in the State, severely affecting the city of Hyderabad as well. On October 13, the monthly average rainfall of Hyderabad for October (103.6 mm according to Skymet) was surpassed on a single day when 192 mm of rain fell. According to the India Meteorological Department, this is the highest rainfall for October recorded in Telangana’s capital since 1903. Such a high intensity downpour in a short span is bound to affect a densely populated urban area, and Hyderabad was no exception. At least 24 people were killed and several localities submerged and isolated following incessant rains and the overflowing of the city’s lakes. Other districts were badly affected too: roads damaged and irrigation tanks breached. The monsoon storm that never became a cyclone, has managed to cross the east (Andhra Pradesh) and west coasts (north Karnataka and Maharashtra) of India. This is rare and a rain-related disaster event that is difficult to plan for. Floods and deluges, like any other disaster, disproportionately affect the poor. Disaster management agencies have managed to limit the impact of the disaster as many of those marooned in submerged areas and flooded houses were rescued. But the extent of the damage and the turmoil show a lack of preparation and disaster mitigation, a problem that plagues most urban centres in the country.

Much of the damage was due to the overflowing of lakes — in particular, the Hussain Sagar Lake in the middle of the city and the breaching of storm water drains. Construction over lake beds and encroachments of drainage channels have been identified as problems that have exacerbated flooding and inundation in the city in the past (the deluge in August 2000, for example). But the little that has been done to unblock existing storm drains over the last decade has not been enough to handle the requirements of the city, which still depends upon an antiquated sewerage and drainage system. Hyderabad urgently needs to expand and remodel its drainage system. Besides lakes and canals, wetlands and watersheds play a vital role in absorbing excess rainfall, but regrettably, rapid urbanisation in the twin cities has resulted in the loss of a large portion of the wetlands. An analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment in 2016 revealed that 3,245 hectares of water bodies were lost in Hyderabad between 1989 and 2001. In the long term, the effects of flooding due to deluges can only be mitigated if urban planners take into account the hydro-geology of cities and ensure that construction, development and land occupation do not take place in a way that reduces the area of wetlands.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dealing-with-a-deluge-the-hindu-editorial-on-hyderabad-floods/article32865504.ece
359,2020/10/16,Showdown in Thailand: On student protests,"The protests are unlikely to die down without a reversal of recent anti-democratic steps

The Thai government’s decision to issue an emergency decree, banning public gatherings and censoring the media, demonstrates both its acknowledgement of the seriousness of the challenge it is facing in the wake of months-long street protests and its refusal to address the actual problems. The protests, from July, by students against the authoritarian government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha have since grown into a large political movement, raising challenges for the government and also to the monarchy, an institution that has historically been protected from public criticism by tough lèse-majesté laws. Mr. Prayuth, who captured power in 2014 through a military coup, won a disputed election last year. Backed by the King, he has tightened his grip on power and cracked down on dissent. In 2017, a new Constitution saw democracy being eroded further. This gradual erosion of political rights, along with the outbreak of COVID-19 and its related economic woes, triggered the protests. The protesters have earned the support of sections of society. They now call for the Prime Minister’s resignation, free and fair elections, a new Constitution that guarantees democratic rights, and want the powers of the monarchy clipped. The declaration of the emergency decree comes a day after protesters raised the three-finger salute, a symbol of resistance taken from The Hunger Games trilogy, at a royal motorcade.

Under the new rules, the authorities have banned the gathering of five or more people and restricted the publication of news “that could create fear”. They can also prohibit people from entering “any area they designate”. Clearly, the government has granted itself sweeping powers and wants to crack down on the protests. But this could have the opposite impact. That the students continued their agitation despite government pressure and have started questioning even the monarchy shows their resolve. The Thai monarchy, which lost absolute powers in the 1932 revolution, continued to maintain its high influence in the government and god-like status in society. Now, the protesters are openly challenging the powers of King Vajiralongkorn, who ascended the throne in 2016 after the death of his father, Bhumibol Adulyadej. The new King, who is mostly in Europe, and Mr. Prayuth, have become symbols of extravagance and oppression for the protesters, who have dismissed the emergency decree, saying the movement has gone past the point of no-return, and in turn setting the stage for a showdown with the police. In the past, authorities had used brutal force to suppress protests. In 1976, the police and right-wing thugs massacred protesters in Thammasat University, Bangkok. Mr. Prayuth and his Generals should ask themselves whether they should take matters to such a dangerous turn or reach out to the protesters, seeking a solution to the crisis.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/showdown-in-thailand-the-hindu-editorial-on-student-protests/article32865516.ece

361,2020/10/16,"Theatres re-open, but Friday seems like a dry day","Owners look forward to a better response from patrons during the upcoming festival season and the year-end

Many single-screen theatres and multiplexes opened their doors to the public for the first time in months on Friday. However, exhibitors whom The Hindu spoke to were disheartened by the response from patrons. This was expected as ‘trial runs’ by some multiplexes on October 15 saw shows being cancelled as no one turned up, said one exhibitor.

In Bengaluru, PVR and some single-screen theatres, including Santosh, Navarang, Veerabhadreshwara and Sri Vinayaka, resumed screenings on Friday.

Manikandan R., owner of Sri Vinayaka Cinemas in Varthur, said that they were running three different films in two languages. “The response was not as bad as I had expected it to be. Around 15% of the available seats were occupied. I am sure the situation will improve in the following weeks, especially during the upcoming festival season and the year-end,” he said.

A representative of Venkateshwara theatre in K.R. Puram said that they would open their doors to the public from Sunday (October 18) while Veeresh Cinema near Basaveshwarnagar is expected to do so by October 23.

Theatre owners are hoping that new films will attract cinema fans. However, producers are adopting a wait-and-watch approach.

Hasmukh Bafna, a film distributor, said that theatres in other parts of Karnataka also saw dismal football. “In many places, including Davangere and Shivamogga, only one or two theatres are open,” he said. “Theatres were one of the first to stop operations and one of the last to resume.

363,2020/10/16,Police probing Mangaluru underworld connection in murder of bar owner,"The 41-year-old victim was shot and then hacked to death off Brigade Road on Thursday night

The murder of bar owner Manish alias Sarvottam Shetty, 41, who was shot and then hacked to death by assailants off Brigade Road on Thursday night, seems to have been the fallout of gang rivalries within the Mangaluru underworld, the police probe has revealed.

“The murder has all the hallmarks of an underworld hit job. The assailants dropped their weapons and abandoned their bike before fleeing from the scene,” a senior officer said.

The police have recovered the bike and two firearms used for the murder. “We have high-quality CCTV footage of the crime scene,” the officer said.

Underworld operative Vicky Shetty, who hails from Mangaluru and is now believed to be based in Dubai in the UAE, reportedly called up a Kannada news channel to own up to the murder. “We have information that Vicky made an internet call to a channel and claimed to have carried out the hit to settle an old rivalry. We are verifying these claim, and also whether the caller was really Vicky,” a senior police officer said.

Manish, who is from Koppa in Chikkamagaluru district, was named in over 12 cases, including murder and robbery. He was known to be close to another underworld operative from the coast, Bannanje Raja, who was recently arrested by the State police. Manish was a partner in Duet Bar on Rest House Road.

Preliminary investigations indicated that he was killed as revenge for the murder of a businessman, Kishan Hegde, police sources said. Hegde was killed on September 24 in Hiriyadka, Udupi district.

“Kishan was killed over a monetary dispute, and the murder was allegedly financed by Manish,” a senior official probing the case said.

However, the Udupi police’s investigation had neither uncovered underworld links to Kishan nor Manish’s role in his murder.

“But, these are the leads we have picked up. These need to be verified,” the officer said.

The city police are close to identifying the assailants, sources said. “We have information that three assailants were involved. They seem to be underworld operatives from the coastal region,” sources said.

Murder raises concern

The shootout in the heart of the city, off Brigade Road, has raised concerns in the police establishment about the growing brazenness of the underworld. Police Commissioner Kamal Pant said such activities will not be tolerated and stringent action will be taken.

Another senior official pointed out that Bannanje Raja and Ravi Pujari, who were hiding abroad, have recently been brought to India and it was time the city police concentrated their efforts on Vicky Shetty. “The recent global economic crisis due to the pandemic has led to monetary disputes in the underworld. The murders of Kishan Hegde and Manish seem to be a fallout of one such dispute,” said the official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fhh780/article32875610.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGMANISHP5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-probing-mangaluru-underworld-connection-in-murder-of-bar-owner/article32875614.ece
364,2020/10/16,Don’t start construction of stadium in Gunjur village: HC,"Petitioner contends that the plot is not revenue land but ‘deemed to be forest’

The Karnataka High Court on Friday directed the State government not to commence construction of a proposed stadium at Gunjur village near Varthur on the outskirts of the city.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the interim order on a PIL petition filed by T. Narasimhamurthy.

The petitioner had contended that the 27-acre plot, allotted to the Department of Youth Empowerment and Sports (DYES) for construction of the stadium, is not revenue land but ‘deemed to be forest’ even though revenue records do not categorise it as forest land.

Citing a letter written by the Deputy Conservator of Forests (Bangalore Urban division) to the Deputy Commissioner, Bangalore Urban district in January this year, the petitioner has contended that the land is part of a list of lands to be declared as ‘deemed to be forest’, submitted before the apex court as identified by the Forest Department.

The government has allotted the land for construction of a stadium due to political influence based on a technical reason as records treat the plot as revenue land, the petitioner has claimed while pointing out that the Forest Department had raised objection when the work of digging a borewell was undertaken by the DYES in January.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/n3jomo/article32823401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10KRAKARHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dont-start-construction-of-stadium-in-gunjur-village-hc/article32875419.ece

366,2020/10/16,"Police seize huge quantities of ganja in Chennai, Ranipet","Four men have been arrested in connection with the case

The Royapettah police in Chennai seized a huge quantity of ganja from drug peddlers in the city, and from Arakkonam in Ranipet district. Four persons, who had allegedly procured the contraband from Andhra Pradesh and supplied them to several outlets in the city, were arrested.

During a routine vehicle check on Thursday night, Royapettah police personnel intercepted two persons on a bike near B.M. Dharga. On searching their vehicle, police recovered a few kilograms of ganja.

The suspects were identified as V. Praksah, 54 of Harbour and B. Subbu alias Subramani, 50 of Choolaimedu. Further interrogation with them led to the arrest of another associate I. Francis, 47 in Red Hills. Based on leads provided by the three men, the police rounded up another accused V. Balaji, 32 in Arakkonam who was believed to be a major dealer of contraband.

The team seized 144 kilograms of ganja concealed in a rented house on Subramaniam Street, Milk Colony, Arakkonam. The ganja was found packed in small parcels.

A senior police officer said, the estimated value of the seized contraband was around ₹41.25 lakh.

Meanwhile Madhavaram Milk Colony police seized 1.5 kg of ganja from two drug peddlers identified as V. Balaji, 40, from Perambur. He has been booked in previous cases in Perambur and Otteri, police said.

“We had deputed a decoy, and based on information provided by him, we secured the accused. In the course of our enquiry he confessed that he purchased ganja from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh from an individual, Govindh,” a police officer said. Govindh would send the consignment at the Tamil Nadu-Andhra Pradesh Border in Nellore from where Balaji would collected it and sell it in retail in Chennai.

“We are conducting further enquiry to trace all his contacts,” the police officer said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ozqs9p/article32870517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16OCTTH--Ganja,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/police-seize-huge-quantities-of-ganja-in-chennai-and-ranipet/article32870518.ece
367,2020/10/16,A home makeover for reptiles at Madras Crocodile Bank,"As Madras Crocodile Bank waits to welcome visitors again, enclosures are being painted to resemble the reptiles’ habitats of origin

For all of Ally’s 17-year-old life, Madras Crocodile Bank Trust (MCBT) has been home, as it has been for her parents. Now, this young alligator is also surrounded by reminders of her heritage — the outside of her pen is painted with animals and birds that originate from the Everglades in Florida, US.

With the continuing downtime at the enclosure, Croc Bank has found time for renovation.

Pen 1, comprising three enclosures — housing the Cuban crocodile, a critically endangered species in the (International Union for Conservation of Nature) IUCN list, Ally, the alligator and the slender-snouted crocodile — has been painted to resemble the habitat of origin of each of these three reptiles. They sunbathe inside as murals of their warmer blooded friends, including leopards, elephants, and the Cuban tody, pop out of the wall to keep an eye on the visitors.

“We were very lucky to have got a grant from Cholamandalam Finance, as part of its CSR, just before the lockdown started, to reconstruct our first pen,” says Zai Whitaker, author and director MCBT.

“We wanted the pen art to give people an idea of the kind of habitats these species live in,” explains Zai. “So you have the hutia from Cuba, which is a funny little animal — looks like a large guinea pig, and then you have raccoons for the alligator.” The slender-snouted crocodile is from West Africa, and so, has leopards and elephants for company.

The artists behind the project, K Veerabathiran and his team, belong to the nearby village, Vadanemmeli in Kanchipuram.

“I have been working with this wonderful group since I rejoined the Croc Bank in 2015,” says Zai. The team has previously painted stone pillars and signboards imparting information on birds and snake bites for the centre.

Pen 8, which is one of the mother pens, is illustrated with information on crocodiles for kids. “We realised people engage with visual information better. So we thought why not do more of that, the Croc Bank is full of walls!” adds Zai.

Key conversations

Even though it is primarily a reptile zoo, Zai thinks adding wall art of mammals and birds is a good idea as it emphasises the reptiles’ place in the ecosystem.

“From the beginning, when Rom [Whitaker] started his work and I joined him, our real mission was to bring reptiles into the sphere of conversation. By that time in the 1970s, everyone wanted to save the elephant and giraffes, and called for Project Tiger, but snakes were still called pests. So this is part of our journey to make people feel more empathetic towards reptiles.”

What is also likely to help is the dynamic nature of the first three reptiles that visitors will meet upon entry. Ally is currently being trained in basic communication. The over seven-footer appears when called, and understands a mixture of visual and voice commands, including instructions to look up at the trainer, hold the position, jump, or get into the water again.

Despite having to make do without visitors for all this while, Zai believes that the pandemic has underlined how much support the centre has from Chennai. “The response we have had, in terms of donations as well, shows us that people in Chennai see this place as important to the city and are willing to protect it,” she says, happily.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gdmnf8/article32869980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG7492YashSingh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/new-wall-art-at-madras-crocodile-bank/article32869987.ece
368,2020/10/16,"Hesitant to travel too far, Chennai residents picnic in secluded outskirts","Tired of being cooped up at home, Chennai residents have taken to exploring the city’s secluded hills, forests and lakes for some much-needed fresh air and a change of scene

Amal Abishek slowed down his bike as he was riding from Thiruporur to Chengalpattu, through the borders of the Kattur Reserve Forest. He stared in wonder, as a peacock flew overhead.

Over the past couple of months, ever since the lockdown relaxed, the resident of Tambaram has been exploring the hills and lakes bordering Kattur, stopping at any place that looks green and secluded. “I open Google Maps, and look for green areas. If I find a lake, there is generally a forest nearby, if there’s a forest, there is generally a hill beside it. That’s how I have begun to understand our landscape,” he says. He inputs the location on Google or Instagram and checks out pictures of the place. “If there are just five or six pictures, I know it is accessible but not crowded.”

After spending half of 2020 cooped up in their houses, going for walks along the same old neighbourhood , overlooking the same old concrete buildings, people in Chennai are developing a greater appreciation for the city’s pastoral side — hills, lakes, forests and beaches, that are secluded enough to abate fears of crowds and infections, and are within a few hours reach.

In fact, it took a pandemic for avid traveller Preejo TJ to explore his own city. “I have been on road trips in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala, but I hadn’t ever explored Chennai as much as I have in the past few months,” he admits.

Despite the lockdown, Preejo did not sit still in his apartment complex in Taramani. He was one of the first to get permission from the Chennai Corporation, to help out with COVID-19 relief work. The 30-year-old raised about ₹14 lakh, and would go around the city providing rations for the homeless. “Until July, I would go to the Marina and Thiruvanmiyur beaches to feed stray dogs,” he adds. But once the loop roads to beaches opened up in September, he hit the road on his bicycle to ride down the ECR.

“There are nameless stretches of the coast, to reach them you need to go through casuarina forests,” he says. A big fan of meditation, Preejo simply sits in the middle of the forest ground, “watching ants marching with such discipline,” he laughs. Or he heads further down the beach, the rolling carpet of sand entirely to himself.

“That’s why I like riding my bicycle there. I don’t know how safe it is to park vehicles on the road and with a cycle you have the liberty to take it with you and spend however much time you want to, without worrying,” he says.

The ease of the pedal has been inspiring many to take up cycling. A few weeks ago, a resident of Kotturpuram, Aditi Subramaniam, cycled up to the Matsya Narayana temple on ECR, to hold a small picnic on the beach. She is part of a group of 15 friends who have been cycling around Chennai since August.

“We had not stepped out until August. We really needed to get out and do some physical activity. All of us found it a little tough to exercise at home, in the same room where we ate, slept and worked,” she says, adding, “Many of my friends were into sports, but of the social kind — basketball or football.”

Cycling, they decided, would be the safest alternative. They would be far enough to feel safe, but together enough to enjoy each others’ company. Those of them who were not cyclists, bought second hand ones or rented them out. Her friends, says Aditi, belong to different age groups — from 20s to 50s.

People above the age of 50, have been feeling even more cooped up, given that their age puts them at a greater risk. And so, for the past nine weeks, 55-year-old Sonali Menon has been finding an escape in the hills of Chennai.

“We were feeling quite stifled, so we thought of doing something different to get some fresh air,” she says. Sonali met her friend, also 55, in Perumbakkam, and decided to climb the nearby hill. That first trip then turned into a weekly activity.

Preejo, who is in the same line of work as Sonali, that of corporate training, joins them in these treks every Saturday. He does a recce of the places first, by himself. So far they have been to Perumbakkam, Perungalathur, Tirusalam, Pallavaram and Malaipattu near Tambaram. “Often in these places, we see a lot of garbage lying around. If you go to any of these places, it is really important that you don’t leave your waste behind,” Preejo underlines.

Hills of the rockier kind have Amal’s heart. “The ones near Kattur are just one six-feet boulder upon another,” he says. “You can climb them quite easily, but , in some places there is a risk of dropping down by 35 to 40 feet.”

With the migration season setting in, Amal is looking forward to birdwatching. “I have already spotted the rufous treepie, Indian eagle-owl, cormorants, spot-billed pelicans, purple herons and river terns,” he says.

“Beside the Kattur forest, is the vast Sirudavoor Lake,” — Amal sounds excited. That is where he is headed next.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/g40cuv/article32869767.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15MPKaatur5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-hills-lakes-turn-secluded-picnic-spots/article32869773.ece

370,2020/10/16,Lottery agent arrested in Tondiarpet,"Police say the accused was operating in the city for 10 years; search on for one more person

A special team of police personnel on Thursday arrested an agent who sold lottery tickets illegally in north Chennai and recovered a huge cache of lottery slips from his hideout. He was operating from here for more than 10 years, the police said.

Based on a tip-off received by Joint Commissioner of Police V. Balakrishnan, a special team of police personnel was constituted to nab the suspect.

The only clue about the suspect was his acronym JVM. After working out several leads, the police identified that it was Selvamani, 54.

The special team led by sub-inspector Vijay rounded up Selvamani in Kunnalamman Koil Street, Tondiarpet, and stumbled upon a huge quantity of lottery slips. Explaining the modus operandi, an investigation officer said Selvamani had been running a lottery agency under the name of JVM.

The suspect procured lottery strips from other States through three persons — Senthil, Rakesh and Aparna. He sold the numbers, which were written on plain paper, to customers whom he knew since he had been in business for long.

Money siphoned off

After the prize money was announced by the respective lottery operators outside the State, he would distribute the money to the winner here. He settled the money in part payment or disbursed it after siphoning off a major portion. All the ill-gotten money was invested in immovable properties and jewellery.

Selvamani has been booked under provisions of the Lotteries Regulation Act and the IPC and remanded in judicial custody.

Sale of lottery tickets, including online ones, is banned in the State since 2003.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vyzlij/article22934093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-stock-handcuff,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lottery-agent-arrested-in-tondiarpet/article32867471.ece

373,2020/10/16,The road to zero hunger by 2030,"Resilient food systems will have to be built back as the world is not on track to achieve global targets

Food is the essence of life and the bedrock of our cultures and communities. It can be a powerful means to bring people together to grow, nourish and sustain the planet. The exceptional circumstances we have all been living in through 2020 underscores this — not only does COVID-19 pose a threat to food security and agricultural livelihoods, it compounds the threats already faced by 690 million people around the world. This World Food Day, we — the food agencies of the United Nations (UN) — pledge to work together to end hunger, eradicate food insecurity and achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2.

There is much to be done. While we can all be proud of the progress we have made — for instance, agricultural productivity has improved significantly in recent decades — yet sadly, more than two billion people globally still lack access to sufficient, nutritious and safe food. Projections show that the world is not on track to achieve zero hunger by 2030, or to meet global nutrition targets.

Also read | Fight against hunger disrupted by coronavirus-induced recession

India has gone from being a net importer to a net exporter of food grains. This strength has been evident through the pandemic. Central and State governments were able to distribute around 23 million tonnes from India’s large domestic food grain reserves in three months (April to June) through the Public Distribution System, providing much-needed emergency assistance to families around the country. The government also successfully mobilised food rations for 820 million people from April to November 2020, including finding alternate solutions to provide food rations to 90 million schoolchildren. Throughout the national lockdown imposed in March, there were efforts to remove bottlenecks in the food supply chain due to restrictions on movements, and to ensure that agricultural activities weren’t disrupted. Thanks to these measures, agriculture grew at 3.4% during the first quarter this financial year and the area cultivated this kharif exceeded 110 million hectares. This is a major achievement.

Malnutrition, anaemia

But the focus on food during the COVID-19 containment measures has also brought out the multi-dimensionality of India’s food challenges — not least those centred around malnutrition and climate change. Even as malnutrition in India has notably declined over the past decade, the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey 2016-18 revealed that over 40 million children are chronically malnourished, and more than half of Indian women aged 15-49 years are anaemic. Initiatives such as the Integrated Child Development Services — which provides cooked meals and take-home rations to 100 million children under the age of six, as well as to pregnant and lactating mothers — and the mid-day meal programme, are however stellar examples of how the government is working to fix these challenges.

Climate change continues to be a real and potent threat to agrobiodiversity, which will impact everything from productivity to livelihoods across food and farm systems. Though India is dealing innovatively with climate change — for example, through the development of drought and flood tolerant seed varieties, weather-based agricultural advisories, promotion of millets, and small-scale irrigation — this year, we saw how climate-related shocks made it difficult for farmers to deal with pest and locust attacks, as well as floods and cyclones. Intensified food production systems with excessive use of chemicals and unsustainable farming practices cause soil degradation, fast depletion of groundwater table and rapid loss of agro-biodiversity. These challenges multiply with an increase in fragmentation of landholdings. In India, more than 86% farmers have less than two hectares of land contributing around 60% of the total food grain production and over half the country’s fruits and vegetables.

Essay | The global text of hunger

All this points to two undeniable imperatives: the way we produce food must change through agroecology and sustainable production practices in agriculture and allied sectors; and second, we must stop the waste — one-third of the food we produce is wasted. That is why the UN, and our three agencies — the FAO (The Food and Agriculture Organisation), IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development) and WFP (The World Food Programme) — are committed to working with government, civil society, farmers’ organisations and the private sector to build sustainable food systems.

Supporting India

During the COVID-19-precipitated lockdown, the FAO, IFAD and the WFP worked in close coordination to support the Government of India’s Empowered Group 5 on facilitating supply chain and logistics management, so necessary items such as food and medicines were available. The agencies provided daily updates on the real-time situation on the ground, collating challenges/red flags, dynamic anecdotal data and good practices from their sources in the field. This prompted swift action in terms of resolving bottlenecks and ensured progress on addressing red flag issues.

Profile | World Food Programme, leading the global fight against hunger

What is a food system? It is a framework that includes every aspect of feeding and nourishing people: from growing, harvesting and processing to packaging, transporting, marketing and consuming food. To be sustainable, a food system must provide enough nutritious food for all without compromising feeding future generations.

As countries begin to develop and implement COVID-19 recovery plans, it is also an opportunity to adopt innovative solutions based on scientific evidence so they can build back better and make food systems more resilient and sustainable. Today, with the FAO celebrating 75 years of fighting hunger in over 130 countries, IFAD becoming the first UN agency to receive a credit rating, and the WFP being awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace this year, we are more committed — and better prepared — than ever to together develop solutions with the government, civil society and private sector.

Comment | It’s about food, nutrition and livelihood security

Working in concert

That is why this World Food Day (October 16), we call for global solidarity to help all populations, and especially the most vulnerable, to recover from the crisis, and to make food systems more resilient and robust. Everybody — governments, the private sector, civil society and local communities — has a role to play in transforming our food systems so they can withstand increasing volatility and climate shocks, deliver affordable and sustainable healthy diets for all, and provide decent livelihoods for food chain workers. We must all work in concert to make sure that our food systems nourish a growing population and sustain the planet, together.

374,2020/10/16,The message in the Peace Nobel — multilateralism,"That the pandemic could also be impacting the anti-poverty fight is another reason why the world needs full solidarity

It is a paradox that precisely at a time when the salience of cross-national and global challenges has significantly increased, nation states are less willing to cooperate and collaborate in tackling them. COVID-19 recognises no national or regional boundaries as it rages across the world. One would have expected that countries, particularly those with technological and financial capabilities, would agree to pool their resources together to work on an effective and affordable anti-virus vaccine. Instead, there are several parallel national efforts under way even as the World Health Organization (WHO) has put together a Covax alliance for the same purpose. There is a competitive compulsion at work which may be appropriate in economic and commercial domains. When the lives of people are at stake, active collaboration would have enhanced our collective ability to overcome what has become a public health-cum-economic crisis. But we live in an era when nationalist urges, fuelled by a political opportunism, diminish the appeal of international cooperation. As pointed out by Nicholas Eberstadt of The National Bureau of Asian Research, “The post pandemic world will have no choice but to contend at last with a problem long in the making: the awful dilemma of global integration without solidarity.”

Comment | UN and the retreat from multilateralism

Looming food crisis

This year’s Nobel Peace Prize to the World Food Programme (WFP) is a recognition of its role in combating hunger and malnutrition across the developing world. But the WFP’s achievement are modest, not because it is an inefficient institution, but because it is perennially under-funded. But more important is the message which this award is sending to the world — that we need multilateralism as an expression of international solidarity. It is also a warning that the novel coronavirus pandemic is reversing the substantial gains made in the fight against poverty.

According to the WFP, 132 million more people could become malnourished as a consequence of the pandemic. To the 690 million people who go to bed each night on an empty stomach, perhaps another 100 million or more will be added. This counts for a major world-wide catastrophe and unless the conscience of the world is aroused, we will be condemning vast pools of humanity to living in wretchedness and deprivation. The Nobel Prize to the WFP will hopefully nudge our collective conscience to come together and relieve this looming humanitarian crisis.

The UN at 75 is still important

The United Nations is at the centre of multilateral institutions and processes. It is celebrating the 75th anniversary of its founding. While it is a pale shadow of the vision with which it was invested at its founding, nevertheless it has kept alive the notion of international solidarity and cooperation. If it has become increasingly marginal in mobilising international responses to global challenges, the fault lies with its most powerful member countries. They have deprived the UN of resources. They have resisted efforts to institute long overdue reforms; 75 years on, its structure no longer reflects the changes in power equations that have taken place. It is anachronistic that a country such as India continues to be denied permanent membership of the Security Council. And yet despite these disabilities ,the UN is now an essential part of the fabric of international relations; its role has become even more important precisely because the salience of global issues has expanded and the need for multilateral approaches in finding solutions has greatly increased.

India has been a consistent advocate of multilateralism and Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently said: “India firmly believes that the path to achieve sustainable peace and prosperity is through multilateralism. As children of Planet Earth we must join hands to address our common challenges and achieve our common goals.”

Comment | Jaishankar says states, world bodies prevented collective response to challenges

Institutions and problems

There is a network of multilateral institutions, several as part of the UN system. Others are inter-governmental in nature; still others may be non-governmental of a hybrid character. This is a network which enables governance in areas which require coordination among nation states and set norms to regulate the behaviour of states so as to avoid conflict and to ensure both equitable burden sharing and, equally, a fair distribution of benefits. This network continues to function and deliver benefits to participating states despite the less than propitious international environment. However, going forward, there are more complex challenges which would require a different mind-set and patterns of behaviour.

While there are multilateral institutions they have become platforms for contestations among their member states. There is recognition of the need to cooperate but this is seen as compulsion rather than desirable. When participating in multilateral negotiations, whether at the Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, or later at multilateral negotiations on climate change in the run-up to the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in 2009, my brief would be the same as other country representatives — concede as little as possible, and extract as much as you can. If all delegations work on the same brief, is it any wonder that even a supposedly “successful” outcome is invariably the least common denominator? This may be appropriate when dealing with trade or security matters but not in tackling global challenges such as climate change or the current pandemic.

Comment | A revival of multilateralism, steered by India

Globalisation here to stay

Given the scale, urgency and seriousness of the challenges we confront, we need maximal, not minimal, responses. The dynamics of negotiations and their outcomes would dramatically change if delegations came with a brief to contribute as much as possible within the limitation of resources and demand the minimum in terms of assessed needs. This is the international solidarity which a globalised world requires to handle the dense interconnections that bind us.

Globalisation may have stalled, but as we become increasingly digitised, there will be more, not less, globalisation. The pandemic has triggered galloping globalisation in the digital economy . Globalisation is driven by technology and as long as technology remains the key driver of economic growth, there is no escape from globalisation.

Comment | Multilateralism post COVID-19

Don’t we need to first focus on getting our domestic imperatives right and then think of international cooperation? In the contemporary world, the line separating the domestic from the external has become increasingly blurred. In tackling domestic challenges deeper external engagement is often indispensable. This is certainly true of climate change. Even if India’s carbon emissions became zero tomorrow, climate change would continue to affect us if others do not also reduce their emissions. The pandemic originated in a third country, but soon raged across national borders. If there had been a robust and truly global early warning system, perhaps it could have been contained.

The thread in challenges

When one speaks of the rising salience of cross-national issues we must also take into account the inter-connectedness among various challenges. For example, food, energy and water security are inter-linked with strong feedback loops . Enhancing food security may lead to diminished water and energy security. It may also have collateral impact on health security. Raising crop yields with current agricultural strategies means higher incremental use of chemical fertilizers and toxic pesticides. India’s unprotected farmers are exposed to serious health risks as a result and often get bankrupted not due to crop failure but debilitating health costs. It is in recognition of these inter-connections that the international community agreed on a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are cross-domain but also cross-national in character, and hence demand greater multilateral cooperation in order to succeed.

Comment | Resuscitating multilateralism with India’s help

Finally, this also points to the need for a more democratic world order since lack of cooperation from even a single state may frustrate success in tackling a global challenge. A fresh pandemic may erupt in any remote corner of the world and spread throughout the globe. Prevention cannot be achieved through coercion, only through cooperation. It is only multilateralism that makes this possible.

The recent heavy rains in Hyderabad have shown up the gaps in planning by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. It is evident that there is unplanned expansion of this great city, with many illegal constructions on numerous lake beds. As a resident and a member of a family that has lived here for three generations, we are well aware of how it used to be in the past — as a place surrounded by lakes and rock features. Most of these have gradually vanished due to greedy and thoughtless expansion. Nature is bound to retaliate.

T. Kailash Ditya,

Hyderabad

There could be a number of reasons behind the calamity in Hyderabad — climatic changes, improper storm water drainage, illegal constructions on river beds and catchment areas.

Urban flooding is becoming one of the biggest problems in the world. Since 2000, there have been extreme events in Ahmedabad, Delhi, Jamshedpur, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. The National Disaster Management Authority released a 190-page book with guidelines, called National Disaster Management Guidelines – Management of Urban Flooding, but the question is, how many are following it? There needs to be a proper stormwater drain system in all our cities.

Ravi Teja Kathuripalli,

Hyderabad

The visuals of floating cars and people in misery show the magnitude of devastation. City planning seems to have been forgotten and it is clear that there could be numerous violations.

Gentleman captain

Much respected John Reid was a legend of his times , as the iconic captain and all-rounder of the New Zealand team touring India in 1964-65 (‘Sport’ page — ‘In Brief’, “New Zealand great John Reid passes away”, October 15). The team had set itself high standards in the four tests it played. Having drawn the first three tests, the fourth was played at Feroz Shah Kotla, a four-day affair. India needed 70 runs to win on the last day (fourth day) in their second knock when overnight rain almost ruled out play. John Reid along with the ground staff helped drain the water and roll the ground — the picture was published in The Hindu. India won the Test and the series. This is not to be confused with a similar act by captain Graham Dowling, in 1969 in Hyderabad, who also worked with the ground staff to help drain the wicket of water. But the situation was different, in fact the opposite. The Kiwis were in a winning position on the last day. The groundsmen and curator saw to it that the match ended in a draw by going slow in draining the water. There were no match referees then. Today, such a thing cannot happen.

376,2020/10/16,‘Addham’ review: Of duality and tricky areas,"The Telugu web series ‘Addham’ explores the grey areas of morality, and benefits from Rohini’s winsome performance

The first poster of Telugu web series Addham (mirror) piqued curiosity. The three-episode series that now streams on Aha was written and filmed during lockdown, and is the handiwork of a cast and crew that predominantly works in Tamil cinema.

Are the sensibilities going to be different? During the months of lockdown and thereafter, with more viewers having warmed up to content in different languages more than ever before, it’s probably the right time to present some new perspectives and shake things up a bit.

Also Read: Get 'First Day First Show', our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here

Addham ventures beyond the realm of romance, comedy and crime dramas that have dotted the landscape of Telugu content in the OTT space until now. Three stories connected by the theme ‘Morality is a shifting goalpost’ presents characters that are forced to look inwards, introspect on what’s morally right in a given situation, and in the process, heal old wounds.

‘The Road That Never Ends’ turned out to be the most gripping, and a tad disturbing, among the three stories. It begins like a story that’s going to let us into the lives of those who live in the fringes of urban precincts. The camera captures the unsteady rhythm with which a lorry driver (Jayaprakash) navigates the highway at night, sometimes gazing away from the road in front. Nope, a crash on the highway is not where this story is headed. It brings in a new character, an adolescent boy (Praveen) who is running away from home after failing to clear his exams.

The road trip takes a tragic turn and the teenager is privy to the grief of the driver’s wife (Rohini). Rohini takes over from the moment she arrives on screen and it’s through her character that we are jolted into a deeper understanding of the lorry driver’s life. Does morality lie in standing up for the greater good, beyond personal loss? Director Sarjun brings to life the story, written by Siva Ananth, with dexterity, urging us to reflect.

Addham Cast: Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, Prasanna, Rohini, Kishore

Direction: Siva Ananth, Barath Neelakantan and Sarjun

Language: Telugu web series

Streaming on: Aha

Addham also attempts to make us contemplate over what we see on screen, long after the title credits roll.

Siva Ananth directs the story ‘The Unwhisperable Secret’ in which Dr Shruti (Varalaxmi Sarathkumar), a mental health professional, listens in as Ram (Kishore) recaps an incident that has left him with scars of guilt. Something stirs in the visibly poised Shruti. The interaction opens up old wounds. Varalaxmi, whom we have seen in mainstream Tamil and Telugu cinema often as the heady, cocky woman of power, comes up with a restrained performance that mirrors her inner conflicts and duality. Does she stand up for what she believes is right? What if she begins to look at things differently and that heals her, before she can heal someone else?

To its merit, Addham doesn’t spoon feed the audience. It trusts us to read between the lines, and that’s a welcome change from the usual narratives.

Perhaps the weakest story among the three is ‘Crossroads’, featuring Prasanna, Pavitrah Marimuthu and Abirami Venkatachalam, directed by Barath Neelakantan. At the crossroads of a personal relationship, Prasanna finds an unlikely glimmer of hope through a chance encounter, and ideally, we should be rooting for them.

However, there’s not enough that is revealed about the lives of the three principal characters. We don’t know the story of the bickering wife; what equation did Prasanna share with her and when did their relationship sour? In the given circumstance, the new development seems to be the way out. But I was left with questions. Given the more complex questions of morality in the other stories, Crossroads somehow didn’t measure up. Prasanna is dependable, as always, but this story could have been fleshed out better.

The ideas explored in Addham are universal, beyond region and language barriers. It’s not a perfect, bravura series but definitely worth delving into. Shelley’s cinematography and Sundara Murthy’s thematic music score, along with the performances, help the web-series. The standout performance comes from Rohini. In barely a few minutes, she makes everything look believable, and deeply moving.

378,2020/10/16,Chef Saby returns with Saby’s Deli - Soulful Decadence,"Get a taste of Armenia in Delhi with mushroom manti and ponchiki, with chef Saby’s home delivery menu

A subject that never fails to intrigue me is the way food crosses borders. Take Armenian food. Who would have thought that one day you’d get to eat dishes that are a part of life in the Eurasian country? But let’s not forget that India has old links with Armenia, ever since the first traders came from there in the late 17th century. There are people of Armenian origin living mostly in Kolkata.

That should explain why an intrepid chef opened a restaurant serving Armenian delicacies in south Delhi a few years ago. I wanted to try out the food, but never managed to do so. But now, I am happy to say, Sabyasachi Gorai — known widely as Chef Saby — has started a food delivery service, and on the menu are a couple of Armenian dishes.

The outfit is called Saby’s Deli - Soulful Decadence. I received a menu the other day and found it interesting. For those who like their fish and meat, there is Icelandic salmon steak (₹950 for 200g fish and 350g of mash and vegetables plus taxes), slow roasted American chicken leg and thigh (₹800 for 400g with bone), and Nordic lamb neck (₹600 for 300g of meat with bone). For vegetarians, the menu includes aglio e olio pepperoncino (₹450 for 500g), sautéed beans and spinach (₹200 for 250g); spaghetti Alfredo (₹450), roast vegetables (₹200 for 250g).

The produce, the Deli says, are sourced from the USA and Scandinavian countries, and then vacuum-packed and transported frozen through a cold chain. The dishes are then paired with local vegetables and oven cooked with just a little oil, it says.

I can vouch for this — the food is light, yet delicious. I wanted a taste of Armenian food, so asked for the mushroom manti — Armenian ravioli stuffed with mushroom and cheese, in a tomato sauce (₹500 for 300g). It was superb, nicely creamy and spiced. The pasta — tossed in olive oil, black and green olives, capers and chilli flakes — was smooth and al dente (which is how I like it). I enjoyed the roasted pumpkin and carrot, too — plump pieces that had been roasted with a dash of sea salt, olive oil, fresh herbs, and whole red chillies.

The lamb dish consisted of small pieces of meat on bone that had been braised for three hours with vindaloo spices. I liked the gravy; the meat had been cooked just right too. The slow roasted chicken leg and thigh (the chicken was American, and thus rather large!) was surprisingly tasty. It came with roasted vegetables, a garlic mash, and a delightful gravy flavoured with rosemary.

The chicken had been marinated overnight with ginger and garlic and then slow cooked with a splash of garlic oil on a bed of vegetables, Chef Saby tells me. A smoked chilli rub was applied on the chicken, and then it was again slow cooked for a bit.

I loved the dessert. Called ponchiki, this is an Armenian version of a doughnut with a filling. The patisserie includes cookies and cream (₹150 for 200g), a rich dry fruit cake with home-made liquor (₹250 for 200g), three milk cake (with condensed milk, cooking cream, and Niagara whipping cream with sugared nuts — ₹400 for 350g), and lemon and maraschino cherry cupcakes (₹350 for a dozen). Selling dishes by weight is now a trend in food delivery, it seems.

Food is delivered (with varying charges) across Delhi-NCR. Place your order (9910731957/ 9717714687) by 6 pm, for the next day.

Chef Saby’s food has re-ignited my love for travel. I am thinking of Yerevan. But first, I must get to know the food!

379,2020/10/16,Here’s how Visakhapatnam’s popular roadside eateries sailed through the pandemic,"Relying on their loyal customer base and encouraging takeaways, well-known snack corners in the city struggle to make their ends meet

Every year, Nikhil Haldar, a street side vendor who sells traditional Bengali jhal muri in Visakhapatnam, is excited about Durga Puja. Not only is it a festive season for the 57-year-old native of Hooghly but also a time when he can pocket extra income by setting up a stall outside Waltair Kali Bari, one of the oldest pujas in the city. But this year, he is unsure as his stall has been closed for over six months now due to the pandemic and the puja celebrations in the city are expected to be subdued.

“I solely depended on my jhal muri stall for livelihood, with the pandemic and no puja celebrations thia year it is a double blow to my income. I came to Visakhapatnam in the 1980s in search of employment along with my brother. The city gave me a chance to earn with dignity but now I am unsure of the business as people are wary to eat from roadside eateries,” says Nikhil who has been surviving on his savings and borrowings from this brother for the past several months. He plans to start setting up his stall from the last week of October as all this while he was scared to step out due to the virus. “I have been hearing about how expensive the treatment for the virus is so I am worried about stepping out. But I have exhausted all my resources so I have no other choice now,” he says.

The recent video of an elderly couple who run Baba Ka Dhaba in Delhi has put in spotlight the kind of struggle roadside eateries are facing due to the pandemic. Several of Visakhapatnam’s well-known streetside eateries which have been popular among the residents for their delicacies are now struggling to make their ends meet.

P Ratnakumari has been selling punugulus near the LIC building for almost three decades now. Before the pandemic hit, her business was running in full swing with over 10 workers helping her at the two makeshift stalls which received over 500 customers every day. “When we had to close for over three months, I had to let go of four of my employees as I could not continue paying their wages. We opened the stalls in June first week, and had parcels only until August. But slowly the business has started picking up; we have fewer walk-ins and more takeaways. In the initial days, we had just 10 or 12 customers but that has now increased to over 250 per day,” she says.

It is the loyal customer base who have a fan of her punugulus that are helping her sail through the difficult times. “No one wants to experiment with their food in the current scenario, so the customers we see are the families that have been coming to us for years. We are trying to do our bit during the pandemic by keeping a track of our employee's health conditions, marking blocks on the road for social distancing and ensuring that the staff wears masks all the time. I am looking forward to the rains because that is usually the time when the demand for piping hot punugulus shoots up,” adds Ratnakumari.

When Cyclone HudHud hit Visakhapatnam in 2014, A Kondandara Rao thought it was the rock bottom for his business as he had to keep his stall SKML Time Pass Point, that sells traditional variants of bhajji and muri mixture, closed for almost 15 days. But as the city recovered from the aftermath so did his business. “But this time it is different, people are scared to eat outside. So just to assure them I strike a conversation and then explain how cautious I am with my food, and how well I sanitise the cart before and after the use each day. I am also careful with the washing of vegetables that I use. I do not allow anyone in the four-feet radius of my cart. Mostly, I encourage people to prefer takeaways as it would be safer for them and for me,” says Kondandara who has been setting up his stall at Jagdamba Junction for the past 28 years.

He reopened his stall in mid-June after shutting it for almost two and a half months. “Initial few weeks were really hard as there were barely three or four customers. But this has now improved as I cater to over 150 customers everyday. This is just 25% of what our normal business is, but it is better than not making any money at all,” he says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/dvn92c/article32873081.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15MP-PUNUKULU,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/heres-how-visakhapatnams-popular-roadside-eateries-sailed-through-the-pandemic/article32873082.ece
380,2020/10/16,"For World Food Day 2020, look inwards and go native","The theme for this year’s World Food Day — on October 16 — is ‘Grow, Nourish, Sustain, Together.’ We explore how this fits in with our pandemic needs

COVID-19 has made us re-look, rethink and reconsider what we eat. When supermarkets, restaurants and business establishments shut, it was locally-grown food brought by the farmers or local vendors that came to our rescue. Kitchens got busy, and so did information-sharing on recipes and ingredients.

Hyderabad-based farmer Madhu Reddy says, “People seemed to take an interest in what they ate and cooked. Friends called each other to ask how to cook vegetables they had never purchased before. Kitchen gardens became a trend. I feel the theme year is apt. It should make us aware as consumers, and more responsible towards our food growers.”

‘Power to influence’

World Food Day (WFD) is celebrated to commemorate the birth of the United Nations’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) that was established on October 16, 1945. It is celebrated every year with a new theme. The objective is to create awareness about the existing problems of obesity and malnutrition due to hunger.

The FAO states, “Everyone across our food sector plays an important role in ensuring nutritious food is available — but you can make a difference too! Consumers are more than just eaters; you also have the power to influence what is produced through healthy food choices, which in turn contributes to more sustainable food systems.”

They have also listed everyday actions to help each one of us become a food hero and make healthy food part of our lifestyle. The actions include: choose healthy and diverse, influence positive will, join initiatives, choose local, choose seasonal, grow at home, respect food and food development, support development initiatives and finally, support food-related business and retailers.

Lest we forget... The Ark of Taste is an online catalogue that gathers alerts from people who see the flavours of their communities disappear, taking with them a piece of the culture and history of which they are a part.

Ark of Taste travels the world collecting small-scale quality productions that belong to the cultures, history and traditions of the entire planet: an extraordinary heritage of fruits, vegetables, animal breeds, cheeses, breads, sweets and cured meats.

This year, India sent kachri, a vegetable from Rajasthan. Kachri belongs to the cucumber family and is somewhat similar to the sponge gourd.

Chef Sabyasachi Gorai, who is active in the slow food movement, cannot agree more. Sabyasachi, fondly called Saby in food circles, says, “We must not just blame Western food habits. The problem lies with us as consumers. We stopped asking questions about our native food and where the food we eat comes from. We have conveniently forgotten about seasonal foods and are eating what is made available. In a way, we have stopped understanding the food of our ancestors and started relying on food that just looks good. We started eating for our eyes and less for our well being.”

Stressing on the importance of provenance, Saby further adds, “As an active member of the slow food movement, I am keen on pushing people to their native food habits. India has a good store of seed banks and we must do what it requires to save our foods. Our concept of eating clean to be healthy is one-sided. Eating clean isn’t only about eating healthy, it depends on eating and knowing what is grown where. Bring back ancient food wisdom and loosen your purse strings to buy local produce. We must remember that the farmer must also survive for us to survive.” Saby also reminds us not to discriminate against any food as ‘poor man’s.’

Aarti Gill, founder of plant-based food nutrition label Oziva, has a slightly different approach but treads on the same line as Saby. Giving importance to natural nutrients from plants, Aarti’s focus is on standardisation. She feels India is rich in flora and fauna has not yet made the best use of its resources. Her issue is with our willingness to pop a pill instead of meeting the deficit with food.

Label alert

Aarti also raises concern on our dependency on synthetic nutrients instead of relying on naturally-found nutrients in plants. “Indians as consumers are yet to start reading food labels. Once we start doing that, we will know what we feed ourselves and our children. Natural foods have better absorption than synthetic add-ons, so we have to look at making an active change. We can begin by becoming more aware about what we eat and replacing foods that have a lot of synthetic minerals with natural food.”

She has one more point to add: “Avoiding food wastage should be a continued effort.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/k5gohe/article32869862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16MPFARMER1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/world-food-day-2020/article32869863.ece
381,2020/10/16,BAI offers to help State redevelop cessed buildings and SRA projects in Mumbai,"Apex body in Indian construction industry says its 20,000 business partners are ready to shoulder the responsibility

The Builders Association of India (BAI) has approached the Maharashtra government with a proposal to join hands for the redevelopment of 14,250 cessed buildings and 1,500 Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) projects stuck for years in Mumbai.

The BAI, the apex body in the Indian construction industry with over 20,000 construction companies as its members, has expressed its willingness to assist the State government and its agencies in completing the projects by providing contractors. In a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and State Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad, BAI said if the government accepts their proposal, then Mumbai will be of slums and dilapidated buildings.

Mohinder Rijhwani, chairman, Mumbai centre, BAI, a study conducted by the association found a lack of trust between tenants and developers, and developers and financial institutions. “This has led to projects for the development of cessed buildings and slum rehabilitation schemes being stuck for 25 to 30 years. The study shows when government agencies like MHADA, MMRDA, CIDCO are involved, distrust is eliminated and projects get completed in the stipulated time. On the basis of this, we decided to approach the government with our proposal. If the proposal gets through, the city will be largely benefited,” he said.

BAI said its 20,000 business partners are ready to shoulder the responsibility of completing cessed buildings and SRA projects. “While doing this, BAI is not asking for any monetary gain or changes in the Development Control Rule. Government agencies will be free to sell the housing stock generated out of the saleable components and generate revenue. Thus, all stakeholders such as tenants, owners, occupants and the government will be benefited from these projects,” said Mr. Rijhwani.

”As per government records, there are 14,250 cessed properties in categories A,B and C of the Development Control Rule 33(7). Even after 29 years of the cess provision, no concrete steps have been taken despite having sufficient funds for their rehabilitation,” said Anand Gupta, chariman of BAI’s Housing and RERA Committee.

“Similarly, there are 1,500 slum projects under the Development Control Rule 33(10) comprising 14 lakh slum units and housing 60 lakh dwellers in Mumbai. Their redevelopment is in limbo for various reasons, a major one being the lack of confidence of slum dwellers in the present system of functioning,” said Mr. Gupta.

Established in 1941, BAI has 200 centres spread across the country and acts as a bridge between governments and the construction industry.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bai-offers-to-help-state-redevelop-cessed-buildings-and-sra-projects-in-mumbai/article32876752.ece
382,2020/10/16,Man held for duping people by posing as Mahanagar Gas employee,"Accused would enter homes on the pretext of providing gas connection or taking reading of gas meter and flee with valuables

The Khandeshwar police have arrested a former Mahanagar Gas contractor for duping people by posing as an employee of the company.

The police said Pramod Krishna Mayekar (47), a resident of Wadala, on the pretext of providing a gas connection or taking the reading of the gas meter has stolen valuables from a house in Khandeshwar in Navi Mumbai, one in Shivaji Park in Dadar, and two residences in Bhoiwada in Kalyan. He was earlier arrested in 2016 by the Nerul police.

The police said Mr. Mayekar has robbed people using the same modus operandi in Mulund, Vile Parle, Nayanagar, Bhayender and Nirmal Nagar. The police said the accused would approach flats with forms that had the letterhead of Mahanagar Gas. A graduate, who spoke fluent English, the accused would explain the benefits of taking a gas connection.

He would then ask residents to fill a form and pay ₹9,500 in cash to secure the connection. The police said the accused insisted on the payment being made in cash. If the residents gave him a cheque, he would ask them to keep the ‘name’ field blank.

If the flat owners already had a connection, he would claim that he has come take a reading of the gas meter. Being short in height, he would ask for a stool or a chair to reach the meter. When the resident went into a room to fetch a stool, the accused would grab whatever he could find and flee.

Police sub-inspector Vaibhav Ronge said, “While investigating the case, we identified the accused using CCTV footage. He turned out to be a history-sheeter. We finally nabbed him from Wadala.”

Mr. Ronge said the accused robbed a mangalsutra from a flat in Khandeshwar on January 20 this year when the complainant went into a room to get some documents that were required to fill the form.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjs31y/article19198210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-HANDCUFF-arrest,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/man-held-for-duping-people-by-posing-as-mahanagar-gas-employee/article32876613.ece
383,2020/10/16,"Why can’t you think of statutory body for electronic media, HC asks Centre","Court was hearing pleas seeking direction to authorities to issue guidelines for all media to curtail comments on actor Sushant Singh Rajput death.

The Bombay High Court on Friday asked the Union government, “is there any mechanism for checking the content broadcast by news channels before the ‘damage is done’.”

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a bunch of public interest litigation petitions seeking a direction from the court to the authorities to issue guidelines for all media to curtail any comments that may jeopardise the reputation of the police and hinder administration of justice in the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.

Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, appearing for the Union, cited several Supreme Court judgments to say that the court had maintained that the government must not interfere with the freedom of press, and the press must be encouraged to have a system of self-regulation.

To this, the court said: “These judgments are from 2012-2013. Times have changed. This is the most misused freedom now.”

‘Unfettered licence’

The bench said, “Everyone seems to be having an unfettered licence to say whatever they want... Before the so-called damage is done, is there any machinery to check that? Or do you act only when a certain news is disseminated and complaints are received?”

Justice Kulkarni said, “We are concerned with the efficiency of the present mechanism. Once the self-regulation has failed, what should be the remedy? That is the concern. We are in that situation, where the self-regulation has failed.”

The court went on to say that media must keep in mind that a person’s reputation is not tarnished unduly. “Media has fundamental right to freedom. But that cannot be used to infringe the rights of others. This cannot go unregulated,” it observed.

“For the print media, there is the Press Council of India; for cinemas, there is a censor board. Why can’t you think of a similar statutory body for the electronic media. You [Union] do not seem to be in the mood to ruffle feathers with respect to the electronic media. In a case where the media crosses the ‘Lakshman Rekha’, it is for Parliament to step in. Why should the court do it?”, it stated.

384,2020/10/16,"Furnish data on illegal constructions, HC tells civic bodies","‘File additional affidavits by October 26’

The Bombay High Court on Thursday directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and other civic bodies around Mumbai to furnish data on unauthorised constructions in their respective areas.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) after it took cognisance of the collapse of the 43-year-old Jilani building in Bhiwandi on September 21, wherein over 40 people died. The court had widened the scope of the PIL to include all dilapidated buildings in the city.

Civic bodies ‘silent’ on data

During the last hearing, the High Court had asked all these civic bodies to file replies detailing what had been done so far to regulate such construction. On Thursday, as per direction from the court, most civic bodies had filed their affidavits.

The court, however, noted that while most civic bodies, including the BMC, had submitted details of the dilapidated structures, they had stayed “silent” on unauthorised constructions.

The Bench said the BMC and other civic bodies must file additional affidavits by October 26 informing the court of the number of unauthorised constructions, the action taken so far, and the measures they plan to take against such structures in future.

The court also directed the State Urban Development Department to look at what each municipal corporation had said in the affidavits filed in the HC on Thursday, and to file a comprehensive reply summing up everything by October 26. On September 24, the court had made the State of Maharashtra, the BMC, and the municipal corporations of Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Kalyan-Dombivli, and Navi Mumbai, respondents in the case.

Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni told the court, “We will file our replies detailing what has been done so far across the State for such buildings and measures taken, as well as the steps we propose to take in future.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/n47rgt/article31960285.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-BOMBAY-HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/furnish-data-on-illegal-constructions-hc-tells-civic-bodies/article32865919.ece
385,2020/10/16,"Heavy rain claims 27 lives in Solapur, Sangli, Pune districts","Chief Minister asks State administration, Army, Navy, Air Force to be on high alert

At least 27 people have died in rain-related incidents in Solapur, Sangli and Pune districts of western Maharashtra, officials said on Thursday. Over 20,000 people were evacuated to safer places in these three districts. Mumbai too witnessed waterlogging after overnight rains on Thursday.

“A total of 27 people have died due to rain-related incidents in Solapur, Sangli and Pune districts since Wednesday. Fourteen casualties are from Solapur district, nine from Sangli and four from Pune district,” said an official from the Pune Divisional Commissioner’s office.

The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) began rescue work in Pandharpur, where six people died in wall collapse on Wednesday, while over 6,000 people from 500 families were evacuated in Solapur.

In Pune, the police retrieved three bodies, including that of a woman, after four people on two two-wheelers were washed away in Daund taluk while trying to cross a small bridge on a stream. Two NDRF teams stationed in Maval taluk have been deployed for rescue and rehabilitation efforts. While one team reached Pandharpur, the other was pressed into action in Latur in Marathwada.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray chaired a meeting to take a review of the flood situation and asked the State administration, Army, Navy and Air Force to be on high alert to tackle any emergency in parts of western Maharashtra and Marathwada.

In a statement, the Chief Minister’s Office said, “NDRF teams have been stationed in Osmanabad, Solapur, Pandharpur and Baramati.” The Chief Minister asked the administration to avoid loss of life, property and agriculture and expeditiously carry out assessment of the losses caused by the rains. He also directed the local administration to provide financial aid to the kin of those who lost their lives in the wall collapse in Pandharpur.

Thousands marooned

Relentless overnight rain led to massive property damage in Solapur and Pune districts, with thousands of villagers marooned by rising floodwaters in rural Solapur.

Rising levels of Sina river have affected residents in at least 100 villages in Madha and Mohol taluks in Solapur, with several livestock being washed away by the floodwaters. The Vakav village was entirely cut-off from the rest of the district by the swollen waters of Sina river.

As per the Solapur district administration, at least 1,000 people were evacuated from Pandharpur on Wednesday night. Authorities of the Vitthal-Rukmini temple trust said it would take the responsibility of feeding and lodging those evacuated from their homes.

Two lakh cusecs of water were discharged from Ujjani dam since 10 p.m. last night. With rains providing a temporary reprieve to Solapur in the morning, the discharge has been reduced to one lakh cusecs. The rains have compelled authorities to shut traffic on Pune-Solapur road, as well as roads connecting Solapur to other districts like Bijapur in neighbouring Karnataka.

Intense and continuous showers saw an alarming rise in the water levels of all major rivers in western Maharashtra: the Panchganga in Kolhapur rose by seven feet, owing to massive rainfall throughout Wednesday night, while the Krishna river level in Sangli has risen by five feet in just three hours. All main roads in Sangli have been closed for traffic as a precautionary measure.

In Pune, overnight showers caused damage to property in the city with furious rainwaters mangling scores of two-wheelers parked in the open. In Baramati in rural Pune, a flood-like situation prevails as several residents have moved to higher grounds for safety. The rains have led the Savitribai Phule Pune University to postpone the final year examinations scheduled for Thursday.

As per a notification put up on the varsity’s website, authorities said it was postponing the online and offline exams given the flood-like situation and the fact that the civic administration had issued a cyclone and heavy rainfall alert. They said the revised schedule would be announced soon.

In Pune city, Katraj-Sinhagad Road, Sahakarnagar and Shivajinagar areas were badly hit with water entering houses, including Patil hospital on Sinhagad road.

Rainwater swept into the Chandan Nagar police station on old Mundhwa road, with personnel spending the intervening night between Wednesday and Thursday in cleaning up operations.

PMC to blame, says Sule

Baramati MP and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Supriya Sule visited the worst-hit areas in Katraj in Pune city later in the day. Hitting out at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) controlled-Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Ms. Sule said it was responsible for the deplorable state of the city’s public works. She said, “A similar situation occurred last year in which more than 20 people lost their lives owing to intense bouts of rain. But it appears that the PMC has not grown any wiser and is not expending sufficient funds to improve the city’s anti-rain infrastructure.”

BJP leader and Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said that no one ought to play politics over natural calamities. He said, “The BJP has only been in power for the last three years in the PMC. It was the NCP and Congress who were in power for the past two decades in the civic body. So, why weren’t any repairs carried out then?”

The petrol line-up which previously began from the EX trim now sees the introduction of a new E variant which until now had only been available with the diesel engine. The Creta E petrol is priced at ₹9.82 lakh and is offered with the naturally aspirated 1.5-litre engine. Hyundai has hiked prices for its popular mid-size SUV by ₹12,000 to ₹62,000 for the petrol models.

388,2020/10/16,Mercedes launches all-electric EQC at ₹99.30 lakh,"Mercedes-Benz has launched its all-electric SUV, the EQC, in India at an introductory price of ₹99.30 lakh (ex-showroom, India). The introductory price is only valid for the first 50 customers. With this launch, Mercedes becomes the first luxury automaker to introduce an all-electric car in India, with rival firms such as Audi and Jaguar are also readying their own EV offerings.

The EQC will initially be available in Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai, and via the brand’s online portal. Based on the GLC, the EQC gets extensively reworked styling in a bid to ensure it stands out. With a unique grille and headlamp treatment, punctuated by an LED bar, a few blue accents, and tail-lamps that are joined by a light strip, there’s enough to set it apart from the rest of Mercedes’ SUVs. The futuristic-design theme continues on the inside. Although it is typical new-age Mercedes, with its dual-screen infotainment and instrumentation display, details like the bronze inserts in the air-con vents, and unique seat design set it apart as an EV.

Equipment on offer includes the latest MBUX infotainment system with connected tech, 64 colour ambient lighting, a sunroof, adaptive LED headlamps, seven airbags, Attention Assist and more. Power comes from two asynchronous electric motors, one on each axle. They produce a combined 408hp and 765Nm of torque and come paired with a floor-mounted 85kWh lithium-ion battery pack. The set-up gives the electric SUV a WLTP-certified 400km range on a single charge. Charging times vary depending on the electrical supply, with a full charge from a standard 15A (3.4kW) domestic socket taking 21 hours, or 10 hours with the 7.5kW wall-box charger provided by Mercedes. These charging times can be cut down considerably using the network of 50kW DC fast chargers (90min claimed) that are slowly coming up across different cities. Owners will be able to access over 100 EQ charging points in 48 cities across the country.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/1yom6q/article32874414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MPMercedeslaunchesall-electricEQCJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/mercedes-benz-has-launched-its-all-electric-suv-the-eqc-in-india-at-an-introductory-price-of-9930-lakh/article32874415.ece

390,2020/10/16,Answering your vehicle-related queries,"Aftermarket cruise control

AK, Bengaluru: Is it possible to install an aftermarket cruise control on my 2019 Honda Amaze?

Retrofitting cruise control involves high-precision work with the vehicle’s electronics. While the second-generation Honda Amaze gets cruise control, it only does so in its VX manual transmission variants. So, an upgrade would only be possible if your car is an MT. Get in touch with your service centre to check if it is possible to get the body control module (BCM), steering mounted controls and wiring harness from the VX variants installed in your car. This could be very expensive and if the installation goes wrong, it could lead to huge safety issues. We would advise against it.

Pre-owned petrol car wanted

Rithul, via email: I want to buy a pre-owned petrol car at a budget of ₹18 lakh. It should be feature-rich and with a Sport mode. I don’t prefer Korean cars. What about the MG Hector and Honda Civic?

With a budget of ₹18 lakh, we would suggest you consider the Skoda Octavia 1.8-litre TSI, which comes with a dual-clutch automatic transmission. It offers strong performance, has ample cabin space and a large boot. You could easily get a 2018 or 2019 model for the money, and we would recommend you extend your warranty at the earliest after closing the deal.

391,2020/10/16,Toyota Urban Cruiser: Only a few changes differentiate it from the Vitara Brezza,"But it gets the same 1.5-litre, 4-cylinder, naturally-aspirated petrol engine that makes 105hp and 138Nm of torque

Under its partnership with Maruti Suzuki in India, Toyota will introduce a number of badge-re-engineered models borrowed from the former. We got a taste of the first model under this partnership in the form of the Glanza, which was simply a Baleno with Toyota badging and little else to set it apart. The Urban Cruiser, the second model under the partnership, does get a few changes that helps differentiate itself from its sibling, the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza.

We take a closer look at Toyota’s first compact SUV for India.

Toyota has changed the front end of the Urban Cruiser to differentiate it from the Vitara Brezza and give it a more Toyota family look. This includes a new dual-slat grille with squarish indentations that are flanked on either side by vertical chrome trim pieces. The bumper itself gets a very typically Toyota angular vent design on each end, with a large central opening and a silver skid plate. An intriguing design element is a circular slot in the lower half of the bumper on the driver’s side, behind which the horn is mounted.

While the changes in the greater scheme of things might be small, the new grille and bumper make the Urban Cruiser look a lot more aggressive compared to the Vitara Brezza, and more in-line with other Toyotas.

Specifications L/W/H 3995/1790/1640mm

Wheelbase 2500mm

Boot capacity 328 litres

Kerb weight 1115-1150kg

Engine 1462cc, four-cylinder, petrol*

Power 105hp at 6000rpm

Torque 138Nm at 4400rpm

Gearbox 5-speed MT/ 4-speed AT

*Engine gets mild-hybrid system with automatic gearbox option

Apart from those changes though, everything else is nearly the same — the same 16-inch alloy wheels, the same side profile and the same rear end — albeit with Toyota badges instead of Maruti ones and Urban Cruiser embossed across the thick splashing of chrome above the rear number plate.

Additionally, the Urban Cruiser also gets a few unique colour options, including a Rustic Brown in single and dual-tone, the latter paired with a black roof, and a dual-tone Groovy Orange and white.

While there are a few changes on the outside to differentiate between the Urban Cruiser and Vitara Brezza, the cabin has almost no difference at all. You get the exact same dashboard design, with the same textured hard plastics, the same 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with in-built navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the same instrument cluster too. In fact, the only obvious change is the Toyota badge on the steering wheel in place of the Suzuki one and brown seat fabric as compared to the black in the Brezza.

Under the hood too, there is no telling the Urban Cruiser apart from the Vitara Brezza. It gets exactly the same powerplant as the latter, a 1.5-litre, 4-cylinder, naturally-aspirated petrol engine that makes 105hp and 138Nm of torque. The unit comes mated to either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed torque-converter automatic gearbox. The automatic version also benefits from Suzuki’s fuel saving, mild-hybrid tech. According to ARAI, fuel economy for the manual is rated at 17.03kpl while the automatic is rated at 18.76kpl.

It is when you look at the variants do things get a bit interesting. While available in three variants — Mid, High and Premium, the Urban Cruiser does not offer a bare bones entry-level variant like the Brezza. Like for like, the Mid, High and Premium trims are comparable to the Brezza’s VXi, ZXi and ZXi+ trims so even the ‘base’ variant gets you kit such as LED headlamps with DRLs, power folding wing mirrors, 2-DIN audio system, key-less entry and go and auto AC. Additionally, all three variants are available with both gearbox options

Prices for the manual version range from ₹8.40-₹9.80 lakh while Urban Cruiser automatic prices range between ₹9.80-₹11.30 lakh. Compared to the Maruti Vitara Brezza, this is just ₹5,000-₹15,000 more depending on which variant you choose.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/lr30tg/article32874148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MPToyota6JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/toyota-urban-cruiser-only-a-few-changes-differentiate-it-from-the-vitara-brezza/article32874149.ece
392,2020/10/16,‘Bicycle Trains’ to encourage cycling culture,"Initiative to acquaint school students with cycling routes

To encourage students in the city to cycle to school once they reopen, the Indus Cycling Embassy here has launched ‘Bicycle Trains’ to familiarise them with various routes they can pedal along.

Since students cannot be expected to cycle to school straightaway once they reopen, bicycle trains are being organised for the past couple of days to acquaint them with the routes. For now, they are being organised on two routes — from Kachani to Kowdiar and from Sreekaryam to Kowdiar.

The Kachani bicycle train for students begins at 6.20 a.m. and takes the Vattiyurkavu-Maruthankuzhi-Edapazhanji-Manaveeyam-Kowdiar route to conclude at 7 a.m. The second bicycle train from Sreekaryam begins at 6.15 a.m. and takes the Medical College-Ulloor-Kesavadasapuram-Pattom-Kuravankonam-Kowdiar route.

Bicycle trains on other routes such as Karakulam-Peroorkada; Kamaleswaram-Manaveeyam; Karamana-Thirumala; and Chakka-Pettah-Pattoor are on the cards.

There are already 15 students taking part in these bicycle trains. With school reopening still a distance away, word-of-mouth publicity and social media will attract more young cyclists, especially from the bicycle brigades in schools, says Prakash Gopinath, the city’s bicycle mayor.

Large groups

Encouraging students to cycle to schools is an attempt to develop a cycling culture, he says. The idea is that when students pedal to school in large groups, they are very visible and there is safety in numbers. Also, traffic personnel can be alerted about their approach, making it possible to receive favourable traffic signals. “If a couple of students cycle from, say, Peroorkada to SMV school, they can be joined en route by students from other schools such as Cotton Hill, Model School, or St. Joseph’s and ride together, even if they will need to branch off somewhere during the trip.”

The children, he says, will be escorted by adult members of the organisation during the morning school rides.

For the ongoing bicycle trains, the COVID-19 protocol is strictly ensured. Besides helmets, masks, sanitisers, water bottles, and physical distancing are ensured, says Prakash.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/r9vets/article32878422.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201016-WA0034,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/bicycle-trains-to-encourage-cycling-culture/article32875098.ece
393,2020/10/16,Two Kudumbashree cafés on wheels in Thiruvananthapuram from month- end,"Restaurants on refurbished RTC buses to serve ethnic and other food

Kudumbashree is going to improve its presence in the city’s food scene with the opening of two restaurants on wheels by the end of this month.

The Kudumbashree district mission is gearing up to open a Pink Café and a Café Kudumbashree on refurbished buses of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) at East Fort and Thampanoor respectively.

While Café Kudumbashree specialises in ethnic cuisine, the Pink Café will serve primarily steamed food, though fish, chicken, and packed lunches too will be on the menu.

The buses, with facilities to seat at least 10 diners, will have the added advantage of being parked on KSRTC property in prime locations in the city, says Kudumbashree district mission coordinator K.R. Shaiju.

Condemned KSRTC buses are being refurbished to operate as food trucks. Work on them is expected to be completed early next week.

The Kudumbashree has handed over a deposit of ₹1 lakh each for the buses. It will give the KSRTC a rent of ₹20,000 a month for three years. The kitchens in the buses are being set up at a cost of ₹2.1 lakh each.

The restaurants will be manned by five-member teams led by Subha of Mangalapuram and Aswathy of Kochulloor. Part of the Yuvashree initiative of the Kudumbashree, the two teams will be given training before the cafes become operational. On-the-job training will also be conducted for the members. The units will be monitored by one of the personnel from Kudumbashree’s empanelled agencies that provide training to catering groups.

This is the first time in the State that the Kudumbashree is rolling out such a venture, says Mr. Shaiju. The cafes will provide employment to nearly 20 persons as part of Kudumbashree district mission’s target of providing jobs to 10,000 people under the State government’s 100-day action plan, says Dr. Shaiju.

The cafes will be inaugurated by Minister for Local Self-Government A.C. Moideen and Minister for Transport A.K. Saseendran in the presence of Kudumbashree Executive Director Harikishore S. and KSRTC Managing Director Biju Prabhakar at the month-end.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/twbrz9/article32874101.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201015-WA0100,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/two-kudumbashree-cafs-on-wheels-in-thiruvananthapuram-from-month-end/article32874060.ece

The reservation of wards in the city Corporation for the upcoming local body elections was decided by draw of lots on Friday, setting off intense calculations and speculations within the various political fronts on possible candidates for each of the wards.

Urban Affairs Department Director Renu Raj presided over the process at the Collectorate conference hall, which was held following the COVID-19 protocol.

The wards that would be reserved for women, the Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Caste women were decided. There is reservation for women in 50% of the wards. The SC/ST reservations are determined on the basis of the population of the communities in the wards. All the wards that were not reserved for women in 2015 were earmarked for reservation this time.

Wards for women

The wards that have been reserved for women in the city Corporation are Kazhakuttam, Cheruvakkal, Ulloor, Chellamangalam, Powdikonam, Njandoorkonam, Kinavoor, Mannanthala, Pathirappalli, Chettivilakam, Kowdiar, Nanthencode, Kunnukuzhi, Kanjirampara, Peroorkada, Thuruthummoola, Kachani, Vazhottukonam, Vattiyurkavu, Kodunganoor, Pangode, Valiyavila, Jagathy, Karamana, Aarannur, Mudavanmugal, Thrikkannapuram, Nemom, Punnakkamugal, Pappanamcode, Estate, Melamcode, Poonkulam, Venganoor, Mulloor, Vizhinjam, Thiruvallam, Poonthura, Kamaleswaram, Chala, Beemapally, Fort, Vanchiyoor, Chakka, Shanghumukhom, Pettah, Kannammoola, Kulathoor, Attipra, and Poundkadavu.

400,2020/10/16,Trial run of electric loco conducted on Mayiladuthurai-Thanjavur line,"This section is awaiting inspection by Commissioner of Railway Safety

With overhead electrification works in the last portion of the mainline section from Mayiladuthurai to Thanjavur junction fully completed, officials of the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited and Tiruchi division conducted a trial run of an electric locomotive on the 68-km energised stretch on Friday.

The trial run was done successfully from Mayiladuthurai to Thanjavur in the evening after obtaining approval from the Electrical Inspector to the Government of India for charging the section, a senior official of the RVNL told The Hindu on Friday.

The RVNL, a Government of India enterprise, was entrusted with the task of electrifying the 228-km mainline section from Villupuram to Thanjavur via Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Mayiladuthurai and Kumbakonam and the project was completed in phases - Villupuram to Cuddalore, Cuddalore to Mayiladuthurai via Chidambaram, and Mayiladuthurai to Thanjavur.

Although the last phase suffered a setback when the lockdown was clamped in late March due to COVID-19 pandemic, the works have resumed and have gained momentum since July, because of relaxations announced by the State government with the RVNL overcoming labour shortage for execution of the remaining works.

With the final phase having been completed and trial run conducted successfully from Mayiladuthurai to Thanjavur, the stage is now set for mandatory inspection of the energised stretch by the Commissioner of Railway Safety, Southern Circle, Bengaluru.

The entire mainline section, one of the major stretches under the vast jurisdiction of Tiruchi railway division, has become fully energised now. After obtaining statutory clearance from the Commissioner of Railway Safety after the mandatory inspection, electric loco hauled passenger trains will be operated on the Thanjavur-Mayiladuthurai stretch. Statutory clearances have already been obtained for Villupuram-Mayiladuthurai stretch for operation of electric locomotive-hauled passenger and freight trains.

As part of the project, the RVNL has constructed two traction substations: one at Cuddalore and the other at Thanjavur. Both traction substations have been commissioned. A new traction substation will also be commissioned at Mayiladuthurai. The entire overhead electrification project has been executed at an estimated cost of ₹300 crore.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/trial-run-of-electric-loco-conducted-on-mayiladuthurai-thanjavur-line/article32875514.ece

405,2020/10/16,Advanced TB culture testing lab being set up in medical college,"No need to refer to Chennai for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis hereafter

A state-of-the-art liquid tuberculosis culture testing facility is being readied at the Department of Microbiology at K.A.P Viswanatham Government Medical College.

Being set up at a cost of ₹1.2 crore from the National Health Mission, the laboratory will help screen drug-resistant TB patients, and prevent spread of the infection, doctors said.

While a lab at the medical college has been conducting solid culture tests for tuberculosis, with the new facility, set up in a bio-safety chamber constructed solely for this purpose, the technicians will be able to process tests for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis patients who were being referred to Chennai so far.

As many as 960 samples, in a liquid medium, can be tested in one go as a Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) machine has been set up at a cost of ₹50 lakh. “This is the gold standard in TB testing. A collected sample is introduced to a liquid medium and if bacteria is present, it will consume oxygen in the liquid and grow. This is the basic principle through which the test is done,” K. Lakshmi, Head, in charge, Department of Microbiology, told The Hindu.

To test for drug-resistant TB, at this stage, first-line drugs, which are the first prescribed medicines given to patients diagnosed with the infection is introduced. “In some patients, when these medicines are consumed for over six months, the body tends to become resistant to it. For them, despite treatment, the rate of recovery is slow,” she said. When the bacteria in the liquid medium continues to grow even after the drug is introduced, it indicates that it is drug-resistant TB.

Following confirmatory tests, the patient from whom the sample was lifted will be treated accordingly. Test results are uploaded to Nikshay, a unified portal for TB patient management in the country.

960 samples

As many as 960 samples can be processed in one go and results for positives can be acquired within a week. “TB is a slow-growing bacterium. Until recently, cultures were looked at individually under a microscope through an acid-fast bacteria test at various District Microscopy Centres. However, it only had a 60% accuracy rate. With the new facility, it will be near perfect,” Dr. Lakshmi said.

The entire facility, equipped with three individual bio chambers, is a fully bio-safe lab with negative pressure to ensure the droplet does not affect the technicians. It has other control measures, including a disinfectant shower. “Patients can be diagnosed quickly and treatment started to save lives,” she said.

Seven technicians - four will be recruited under National Health Mission, will soon join the team led by S. Vanathi, Assistant Professor, Department of Microbiology. Dr. Vanathi underwent special training to lead the team. “We are collecting 100 samples to run a quality control test. Once the test is completed, we will begin testing,” Dr. Lakshmi said. The facility is expected to be inaugurated by the Chief Minister soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/advanced-tb-culture-testing-lab-being-set-up-in-medical-college/article32874722.ece

Only around 20% of omni buses started plying from Tiruchi on Friday. While some operators claimed that there was poor demand, many others said they were awaiting a government decision on their plea to waive road tax for April-September period in view of the suspension of bus services due to the pandemic.

A few buses to Chennai and Madurai left from the Omni Bus Stand which had seen no passenger footfall since the lockdown was imposed as a preventive measure against COVID-19. “We have made announcements in the media about resumption of bus services, the passengers will come. We expect total resumption by upcoming Navaratri season,” said R. Balakrishnan, president, Tiruchi Omni Bus Operators Association. While footfall was low, many queries and bookings had been made, he said.

For buses which did ply, only 60% occupancy was allowed as per the Standard Operating Procedures. Sanitisers were to be made available, while bus operators must ensure that passengers wear face masks throughout the duration of the trip. “Buses are sanitised before and after a trip. Pillows and light blankets will not be given. Passengers can bring their own, if necessary. Curtains and blinds have been removed,” Mr. Balakrishnan said.

However, a section of bus operators said that they would not start operations till the pending road tax was waived off. “The road tax comes up to ₹4 lakh per bus. We cannot afford to pay it as we were out of business for over half-a-year.

409,2020/10/16,"Raising vegetables, cash crops will erase delta’s identity: ryots","‘Horticulture department’s initiatives will also impact Cauvery issue’

The Horticulture department’s initiatives to promote cultivation of vegetables in the delta region seem to have sown seeds of apprehension among a section of farmers that the region might gradually lose its identity as the granary of South India.

Already coconut and other cash crop cultivation have become the major agricultural activity in certain parts of coastal belts of delta districts for decades, including the areas served by the Grand Anicut Canal irrigation system.

Now, the Horticulture department has announced that incentives and other financial assistance will be extended to farmers if they switch over to vegetable cultivation instead of going in for the traditional crop – paddy, irrespective of whether the area comes under ‘Old Cauvery Delta’ or ‘extended Cauvery Delta.’

Apart from fixing the extent of the area to be brought under vegetable cultivation for the current crop season, it had also announced that a sizeable amount would be disbursed as the cost towards the cultivation of vegetables if the farmers prefer to take up the cultivation as a group activity.

Regretting that such measures would only weaken the stand of Tamil Nadu in sharing of Cauvery Water for irrigation, P. Sugumaran, joint secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, said already Karnataka, the upper riparian State, had made it a practice to treat Tamil Nadu, the lower riparian State, as a drain whenever it gets copious rain in its catchment areas. On other occasions, it never releases the legitimate share of water into the Cauvery river of Tamil Nadu citing various reasons.

Such being the case, if the Horticulture department succeeds in its endeavour to lure the Cauvery delta farmers towards vegetable cultivation, Karnataka would definitely grab the opportunity and refuse to honour the Supreme Court order by claiming that the Cauvery delta farmers were not suffering, Mr.Sugumaran said.

Given the uncertainty over availability of sufficient storage at Stanley reservoir experienced by the farmers in the recent past and this year, he observed that the chances of farmers moving towards vegetable cultivation in the near future could not be ruled out totally.

“In order to retain the identity of the Cauvery Delta as the granary, the officials should chalk out their plans in such a manner that paddy cultivation remains the main activity in the ‘Old Cauvery Delta’ area,” said S. Ranganathan, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association.

He suggested that such schemes could be promoted among farmers in the new Delta areas as the soil in those areas were more suitable for cash crop cultivation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/21mkpu/article32873971.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TY-DELTA-PADDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/raising-vegetables-cash-crops-will-erase-deltas-identity-ryots/article32873972.ece

The new integrated passenger terminal under construction at the Tiruchi international airport, will be ready by March 2022 with more than 40 % of the construction work having been completed, according to the Airports Authority of India (AAI).

The new terminal is being built to reduce congestion at the Tiruchi international airport -- the Airports Authority of India had undertaken the expansion work, which includes construction of a new integrated passenger terminal building, a new apron, an air traffic control tower and upgradation of airside facilities.

The existing integrated passenger terminal, which is in use for both international and domestic air traffic has exhausted its design capacity, an AAI press release said.

The new terminal being constructed at a cost of ₹951.28 crore has been designed to handle 2,900 passengers during peak hours. The building would be equipped with 48 check-in counters and 10 boarding bridges. It would be an energy-efficient building with sustainable features.

With an area of 75,000 square metres, the new terminal building was being designed as an iconic structure with a majestic roof. The interiors of the building would reflect the colours and culture of the city through materials and textures in a contemporary manner.

The intuitive form of the new terminal would create a unique architectural identity in the Southern region and add a new dimension to the terminal design. Arrival and departure passengers would sense this identity.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone for the new terminal building on February 10, 2019 through a video link from Tiruppur.

The construction of a new apron, associated taxiways and isolation bay was to make the airport suitable for the Multiple Apron Ramp System. In addition to this, the construction of a control room, supporting equipment rooms, terminal radar, radar simulation, automation facilities, VHF, AAI offices and meteorological offices were also part of the project, the release added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/422h35/article32872892.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16OCTTH--AIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/new-integrated-passenger-terminal-at-tiruchi-airport-to-be-ready-by-march-2022/article32872893.ece

Animals took centre-stage in Usha Rajagopalan's childhood in Thiruvananthapuram. Perhaps, not a surprise as her father, AS Ananthasubramaniam, was a Conservator of Forests, and the Thiruvananthapuram zoo was akin to a second home for her while growing up.

In her autobiographical book The Zoo in My Backyard, Usha paints a humour-laced picture of her youth at her home in the heart of the city. ""I grew up with all those animals and birds (mentioned in the book). Whenever my father came across orphaned or injured animals, essentially cubs, during his trips, he would bring them home. We would look after them until they recuperate before handing them over to the Thiruvananthapuram zoo,"" says Usha from Bengaluru, where she is settled.

Conceived along the lines of noted late British naturalist and conservationist Gerald Durrell's My Family and Other Animals, the foreword for The Zoo in My Backyard is in fact penned by Lee Durrell. In The Zoo in my Backyard, a host of quirky characters in Usha's household, all going by their nicknames just as they were addressed to in real life, go about their lives with an assortment of wild animals and birds for pets. We see the antics of Kesavan the black monkey, Judie the squirrel, Psitta the parakeet, a dog named Devil, the dog called Tommynathan and so on. There is harmony as well as light-hearted pandemonium in the menagerie of a house. There is the usual human domestic chores as well as a sense of commune that blurs the man-animal divide.

Usha says that as a child she rather felt this domestic setting rather normal. ""We did not really think this as special until some friend or the other would come up and say 'oh I saw you with a black monkey on your shoulder the other day'"", she says with a chuckle. It is not just the close members of her family that are integral characters in the comic episodes but also other such as the cook, the maid, the driver have their voice.

Her father passed away in 2006 and Usha wanted to pay homage to him. The first part, titled 'Creatures, Great and Small' with 26 chapters is essentially a compilation of a fortnightly newspaper column that ran for a year till 2008. ""I reworked the pieces for the book. The second section, 'Creatures, Human', which focus on the members of my joint family then, was written this year,"" explains Usha, a translator and lake conservationist. The first section is interspersed with black-and-white minimalist sketches done by Usha's daughter's friend, Teamea Costa.

Usha says what she intends to convey through her work is the importance of growing up with some animals or birds or the other. ""So that you are not completely detached from nature. On the other hand, the world over, many species of animals and birds are becoming extinct. Sadly, wildlife conservation is going down,"" she adds.

413,2020/10/16,Enough with the token tree planting,"These drives often mask an economic aim as a climate saving solution

Almost every national event calendar day — be it Independence Day or Gandhi Jayanti — is marked by a tree plantation drive. Corporate CSR campaigns, school events, and neighbourhood initiatives aren’t far behind. They commonly feature a greening initiative in a bid to ‘give back’ to nature or ‘restore’ it. While the intentions are good, what we need are concrete, well-thought-out rehabilitation plans and not celebrity-endorsed token initiatives to check off the ‘sustainability’ box in the to-do list for the year.

Earlier this month, Isha Foundation launched a week-long sapling plantation drive across Tamil Nadu (as part of its Cauvery Calling initiative launched in 2019) to mark the 151st birth anniversary of Gandhi. The agroforestry initiative by the organisation — that aims to plant 242 crore trees and ‘and revitalize Cauvery’ — has received flak since its launch for reasons aplenty. The Foundation has remained mum about the varieties of trees it aims to plant, the funds the programme requires, and, most importantly, why a large-scale plantation drive is what the river and its dependent farmers need.

If we’re looking at similar initiatives, Fiinovation’s ‘Ecotopia’ also made headlines last month. The research and advisory agency pledges to plant a million trees across the country by the end of 2020. The drive will use the process of phytoremediation to ‘remediate air, soil and water contaminated with toxins’. Internationally, The Trillion Tree Campaign has been in the news since its launch at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos. It aims to plant one trillion trees worldwide by the end of the decade.

Before you attack me for calling out these well-meaning efforts, I’d like you to read what global research says about mindless tree-plantation drives. The most recent findings come from a paper led by Forrest Fleischman, assistant professor in the Department of Forest Resources at the University of Minnesota. Co-authored by a group of experts who have been researching land-use management and its politics in India for more than a decade, it addresses the pitfalls of blind tree planting while asking for people-centered natural climate solutions. The paper details how proponents of large-scale tree planting drives ‘equate tree planting with climate justice and prosperity for the global south’. However, the opportunity costs of using land for trees instead of other economically beneficial activities are ignored.

The researchers tell us that such campaigns not only divert funding from conservation work, but that fast-growing trees serve an economic purpose, and should not be confused with the aim of forest restoration or a natural climate solution. ‘Planting trees without addressing the social drivers that caused deforestation in the first place will not mitigate climate change because those same drivers will destroy planted forests or shift ecosystem destruction elsewhere’.

Also, establishing tree plantations where forests did not historically occur destroys the natural habitats of plants and of animal species adapted to open ecosystems, and also threatens the livelihoods of people. Take forests, for instance. Since 2015, of the 49 blocks cleared for coal mining in India, nine were in ‘No-Go’ areas.

Another report by U.S. and Chilean academics points to the example of Chile. In the 1850s, the country burnt down and cleared vast areas of native forests for farmland, including oaks and giant redwoods. Much of that farmland has now been replaced by massive plantations of pine and eucalyptus trees with little wildlife, which in turn have helped spread wildfires in the past few years, states a report in Quint. While these plantations had economic benefits, on the environmental front they were disastrous. The authors highlighted that a shocking 79% of so-called forest restoration, committed to by 24 countries in 2019, actually represent forest plantations and agroforestry.

Isha Foundation claims to benefit farmers, to ‘rejuvenate the soil, and improve farmers’ income’. But do we know for a fact that the land they aim to plant trees on are not farmlands in the first place? Or that Fiinovation’s drive will study the land it plans to plant saplings on? As Fleischman et al.’s research states, tree planting programmes often target ecosystems or farmland that rural people depend on for subsistence livelihoods. More often than not, these farmers have insecure land tenure, and the land may be viewed by governments as ‘available’ for tree planting. ‘Replacing croplands with trees can result in unemployment for agricultural workers and elevate food prices’, it states. Additionally, in most places where reforestation is desirable, forests can regenerate naturally from seeds or resprouts, even in landscapes that appear to be highly degraded. Where natural regeneration is insufficient, targeted planting of a few trees from the local landscape must be done.

A common misconception is that planting trees on a massive scale will result in more rainfall, lesser soil erosion, and stabilise groundwater levels in degraded and coastal zones. The solution, however, isn’t this simplistic. It is the rampant misuse of land for activities such as sand mining, dam building and real estate development that results in erosion in the first place. Simply planting trees does nothing.

An article in Mongabay India (January 2020), says that ‘while Isha Foundation says it won’t plant monoculture plantations, the vagueness of the project has left it open for criticism’. It explains how the total number of trees planned for the area covering a third of the Cauvery basin — about 5.9 million acres — gives a planting density of 400 trees per acre. ‘But accounting for agricultural land and forest area, the planting density would be approximately 140 trees per acre. This can only be achieved through tampering with existing landscapes, including grassland ecosystems, experts say’.

What countries worldwide need to focus on are people-friendly initiatives and for forest rights to be taken seriously. Fleischman and his team’s paper gets it right: Solutions that count saplings rather than address the ecological and social drivers of ecosystem destruction are unlikely to succeed.

Response from Isha Foundation:

Since inception, Rally for Rivers and Cauvery Calling have maintained that we will be promoting native and endemic species that are both ecologically and economically beneficial. The list of species has been communicated to our primary stakeholders, the farmers, via social media, telephone calls, brochures, booklets, etc. during our outreach. Across Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, we are promoting more than 80 tree species.

In 12 years, the Cauvery Calling Project aims to plant 242 crore trees with the support of state governments, the public, individual donations of ₹42 towards sapling and project costs, corporate sponsorship, international programmes and others who may contribute in kind or through monetary support. A ticker on the Cauvery Calling website landing page tracks donations.

Cauvery Calling offers a holistic nature-based solution. It is primarily an economic programme with a significant ecological benefit. The primary focus is to improve farmers’ livelihoods by encouraging the transition of a portion of the farmland to tree-based agriculture and increase the green cover in the Cauvery basin.

Cauvery Calling has never claimed that tree planting is the only solution for all the problems surrounding the Cauvery River. Isha Foundation has taken up one significant front of the problem and is working towards a long-term solution.

Isha has experience with almost 70,000 farmers in Tamil Nadu who have implemented tree-based agriculture and seen a rise of 3-8 times in their incomes. Tree-based agriculture is less labour intensive overall and has a high resistance to changing climate, floods and droughts. Thousands of farmers have been positively impacted by adopting tree-based agriculture.

Trees will be planted on the private land of farmers. We are happy to report that thousands of farmers have begun the shift to tree-based agriculture in the last six months with 89 lakh saplings taken up this year. The number is expected to reach one crore by the end of the financial year.

414,2020/10/16,"Touch, feel and social distance: How experiential stores are changing","Experiential stores are rethinking strategies — with virtual pop-ups, sanitised shops on wheels, and experiments with augmented reality

“I’ve really been grateful for lockdown; it has been my most amazing six months,” says Raul Rai, co-founder of lifestyle brand Nicobar. The pandemic may have pressed the reset button for many of us, but for several retail outfits it has been a time to revisit the consumer experience. “The only word that came to mind back then was ‘reimagine’,” says Rai, adding that for Nicobar, it meant ramping up training for its staff — helping them better understand the products so they can pivot as customers’ needs change. Why? “Ultimately that affects the in-store consumer experience.”

Elsewhere, brands have been pulling out all the stops — from using augmented reality to throw open entire inventories to replacing sales consultants with QR codes, they are exploring both ends of the retail spectrum.

Vivo’s new flagship store

The lure of offline

Until just a few months ago, experiential retail ‘built relationships’ with customers through various experiments. Think Stefano Ricci’s VIP clubs with its own restaurants and cigar lounges, or Good Earth’s Paro, with a library, therapy rooms and customised playlists. But the pandemic, with social distancing protocols, threw a spanner in the works. Now, as physical stores once again welcome customers, change is the new constant. A few months ago, Amazon opened its first AI-powered grocery store in Seattle, while last month, e-commerce giant Alibaba wooed Paris with a pop-up store — complete with fashion, accessories and live ‘shoppertainment’ video streaming.

Brands are packing in as much ‘experience’ as they can. Vivo’s new flagship store in Mumbai has zones dedicated to accessories, gaming, and virtual reality. “There will be some areas where the online space might get more traction, but that doesn’t mean an epitaph for offline retail,” asserts Nipun Marya, Director - Brand Strategy. Vivo India is planning to open 20 other flagships within the next six months.

The lockdown has also resulted in different categories of customers, says Kavitha Rao, Country Commercial Manager of Ikea India — from exclusive online shoppers to those who like the best of both worlds. The retail veteran, known for its flat pack furniture, has introduced Click and Collect at its Hyderabad store (order a product online and pick it up). QR codes also help customers watch information videos on their phones. And going forward, the Swedish company is looking to open smaller stores in metros. “The world is looking at smaller format now; perhaps people want brands to be closer to them,” says Rao.

The Stage3 bus

Shop at your doorstep

While some are reinventing the retail experience, others are taking it to the source. New Delhi-based fashion rental service, Stage3 — which had launched its flagship store last October, designed to mimic a walk-in closet — took to the road earlier this year. It revamped the back of a bus to “convert it into a sanitised store on wheels. Everyone in the van [including an in-house stylist and tailor] wears a PPE kit, and we admit one customer at a time,” says co-founder Sanchit Baweja.

Levi’s also put its pedal to the metal. “With lockdown, there was an increased demand for apparel suitable for video calls,” says Sanjeev Mohanty, Managing Director (South Asia, Middle East & North Africa), so they took it to their clients. Levi’s on Wheels, currently operating in Delhi and Gurugram, offers tops, shorts and lightweight denim-led ‘work from home’ collections. And most recently, the India vertical of Xiaomi launched their Mi Store on Wheels, with the intent of bringing their products to customers in non-metros.

StyleDotMe’s AR to enable virtual try-ons

Reimagining the physical

Meanwhile, technology is stepping in to fill in the gaps. Aneeth Arora, for instance, launched péro’s (the Indian brand with a strong European market) latest disco-themed collection in a virtual reality store at Ogaan’s Delhi outlet. The 3D space attempts to recreate an in-store experience and allows buyers to walk through, browse, zoom and click on each piece for more details.

Gaurav Baid, founder of Bengaluru-based digital marketing company Avataar.Me, says that augmented reality, artificial intelligence and virtual reality are finding more takers now. Business inquiries post-Covid have grown three times in the last quarter, with major traction from segments like home decor, consumer electronics, automobile and FMCG. Avataar.Me has several projects underway, including a two-way video calling technology, where a customer can tour multiple stores in a virtual 360-degree format (reminiscent of the digital boutique Swiss watchmaker Hublot created, enabling customers to connect with sales managers in real time).

Though people are slow to adapt to such advances, Meghna Saraogi, co-founder at fashion tech start-up StyleDotMe — which uses AR to enable virtual try-ons in physical stores and online platforms — is positive they will embrace new shopping experiences. The company is now looking to expand to watches and eyewear, along with developing the technology to include 3D try-ons in the coming month.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/dko4vo/article32874479.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PeroOgaan-3,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/touch-feel-social-distance-how-experiential-stores-are-changing/article32874484.ece
415,2020/10/16,"While aarti is virtual, food is for real this Durga Puja","This year the Bengalis in Hyderabad will celebrate Durga Puja with a twist

As expected Durga Puja celebrations will be different in Hyderabad this year. Keeping in mind the physical distancing norms, festival organisers are looking at puja celebrations sans the crowds associated with puja pandals.

Most puja committees will be going live on social media platforms to stream their everyday puja sessions and plan to restrict the number of visitors to 50.

The Kalibari neighbourhood in Sanikpuri is wearing a deserted look unlike earlier festivities. With no people thronging and no buzz, the temple complex looks is anything but a Puja venue.

Member of one of Hyderabad’s oldest Bengali Associations, Bangiya Sankskriti Sangha, Atin Chowdhary says that unlike pre-pandemic years, they are unable to get the protima (idol) from Kolkata. The Puja association which will shift to a different venue this year has a small idol that will be sourced locally: “We shifted our venue to Mehboob College and are keeping the size of the idol smaller.”

Bengali women will be missing the fun and games at the pandal and the endless shopping at Puja stalls. Above all, it will be the ‘sindoor khela’ that will be missed the most.

Atin Chowdhary says, “Core committee members and priest included, we’ll be about 20 people. In such a situation controlling people will be tough. So we have decided to stream the proceedings. But, keeping in mind Bengalis’ love for music and cultural activities, we have decided to keep that online as well. Artistes will perform from their respective homes and keep the Bengali folk entertained and bring home the puja-mood.”

Attapur puja committee is, however, allowing visitors, owing to its sprawling venue but limiting the number of visitors to 50 with live streaming of puja proceedings including the sandhi puja, informs Soumitra Pahari, member of Attapur Bengali Association.

Hoteliers have joined the celebrations by offering the much-loved pujor-bhog. Marigold hotel has a bhog-package of khichdi, dalna, begun bhaja, a selection of tok (the Bengali sweet dips). This apart, there is the much-loved ilish selection as well. Chef Partha is going all out with his team to make the bhog package a meal to remember in puja celebration - 2020. His ilish paturi is a win-win with a personal touch by the chef to the recipe. He says he’s also making sure to make the begun bhaja remind Bengalis of their grand meals by their didas (grandmother) and moms. The khichdi comes with a lovely smokey flavour to give the feel of it being cooked at a puja pandal’s firewood kitchen. Chef Partha says, “I am also not forgetting the sweet deal. We have five-six Bengali sweets, all made in-house. This includes nolen gurer payesh and rosogolla.” The alu-dom and korai sutir kachori are likely to win hands down if fish and meat are part of your daily menu. The package is priced at ₹3,500.

Sarita Sarkar’s ‘Sarkar Kitchen’ is shifting to Club Botanica at Gachibowli to host a Bengali food fest. Sarita, the proud restaurateur says, “We will be serving 16 dishes on a pre-plated thali every day that includes the Bengali snacks, fish curry, khichdi and mishti. We have a takeaway option as well. We priced the pre plated meal at ₹1200.”

Mercure hotel has a compact menu, with the highlight of radha bollovi, and handpicked favourite snacks like chops and devil’s egg. In the main course the Chicken dak bungalow is a winner and other favourites include basundi pulao. For desserts, there is Bengali sandesh and Pantua. Mercure has priced their menu at ₹399.

To recreate the Durga Puja ambienceThe Park will host Durga Puja food stalls in their hotel. The recreation of the food stalls allow Puja food revelry. Chef Thimma Reddy says, “Many people in the city look forward to Durga Puja for the annual break and to eat to their heart’s content. Since most of them won’t travel to their respective homes this year to celebrate with their extended families, we decided to give them the Puja feel here.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/4tfu5f/article32873501.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bengali-food-fest-marigold-Oct-2020-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/durga-puja-during-the-pandemic/article32873504.ece
416,2020/10/16,Is India ready for open-air retail?,"Over the years, we have seen ambitious plans like the JDH Urban Regeneration Project, which was meant to revive tourism and economic activity as well as restore the stepwells in Jodhpur. However, sources tell us that political interference and endless red tape stopped any further work from happening. Local body permissions are an oft-cited pain point for retailers, be it malls or such open-air spaces. Those in the know tell us about the realities of retail spaces.

Rooshad Shroff, architect and interior designer

“I don’t want to be a party pooper, but while having more open-air spaces is a great Utopian idea, at the end of the day, everyone’s taken a real beating economically. And new projects require massive funding.”

Ashiesh Shah, architect and interior designer

“[Cities like] Mumbai do not have the space or the climate for it. I feel open-air markets will be explored for sure, but they will be early morning or evening markets. I don’t see permanent spaces for them evolving; it will be more of a weekend event.”

Vinita Chaitanya, interior designer

“Going horizontal with shopping areas — like large outlet malls in the USA — is a matter of real estate. Who has it and who is going to give that to you? In Bengaluru, going outside the city towards the airport is a huge cost because land prices have gone up. You have to find spaces where real estate is not super expensive, that you can go horizontally and design these kinds of shopping experiences.”

Laila Tyabji, chairperson and founder-member, Dastkar

“The future of these open-air spaces [like Nature Bazaar Venue in Chattarpur, Delhi] often owned by the government, should be given out to organisations that will use them sensitively but also in a way that’s sustainable for the craftspeople.”

Jaya Jaitly, founder, Dastkari Haat Samiti

“Many haats have opened across the country, following the success of Dilli Haat. But they are so badly run that they are either half-dead or misused. That is the problem when you have the government do it; they are rigid, with no imagination and have vested interests. Good NGOs, with established track records of at least 10 years, should be given these haats to run.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/q7o1yb/article32873304.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG8535,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/is-india-ready-for-open-air-retail/article32873317.ece
417,2020/10/16,Call of the mall,"As customers return, a metamorphosis is happening. Across the country, shops are reimagining sales techniques, premium spaces are opening up, and open air is getting a fillip

As a teenager, I often teased my dad about how he shopped at a mall: he would go in with a list of things to buy (in order of priority) and visit only those stores. There was no window shopping; even dinner was slotted into this schedule. Fast forward to now and, in a post-Covid world, I am doing exactly the same. The couple of times I have been to Phoenix MarketCity, Chennai, I spent less than an hour inside, buying nothing but what I needed.

This is the new normal across the country. Where once we loitered and racked up our daily Fitbit step count, the atmosphere in malls now is pure business. Contactless car parking, UV bag scanners, sanitisation stations and temperature checks are par for the course. Every industry has been forced to adapt in order to survive the pandemic, and the retail sector, including mall promoters, is no different. Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO of the Retailers Association of India, says, “It is similar to the time when malls were new; customers had to be attracted with different promotions.”

Amitabh Taneja, Chairman, Shopping Centres Association of India, says that the collective has been placing demands to the government to give a boost to the retail industry. “We’ve asked that financial institutions consider a moratorium period; a one-time loan restructuring with lower rates of interest for organised retail; short-term financing options; and GST rebates, among other things,” he explains. He adds that local and state governments can further help them bounce back by relaxing state duties and taxes, waiving licensing fee and offering fixed electricity charges.

Recent surveys, including one by multinational services network Deloitte, indicate that the future lies in malls becoming mixed-use projects, with “strong leisure and entertainment offerings that will help people find the social interaction they crave, especially now”. Food is also poised to become a game changer, since dining out appeals to all customer segments and cannot be replicated online. However, the next generation of food options will look beyond food courts to innovations such as “food halls featuring rising chefs or higher-profile restaurants clustered in common areas”.

On store design Ashiesh Shah, architect-interior designer

“While most retail is happening online, brick and mortar will evolve. It is tough to shop luxury — suits for men or bridal lehengas — online. I think standalone stores will make a strong comeback. Stores that are larger, with more floor space and higher ceilings, will see a faster entry into the system.”

“I would rather go to a standalone store than a mall. In the former, I know footfalls won’t be crazy for no reason and that you can out the random window shopper.”

“In stores, ventilation is really important, with lots of natural light and as many open windows as you can manage. Store design should also look at quick and easy ways to incorporate and hide sanitisers, so it doesn’t become an eyesore. I would also make spaces more lively and open, rather than dark and claustrophobic.”

Meanwhile, closer home, preparing for customers has been a mammoth task. Even as footfalls across malls hover around the 30% mark, daily/weekly operational costs have gone up by over 20%. Investment in tech and equipment, including apps and UV scanners, is as high as ₹50 lakh per property. But Rajendra Kalkar, President (West) – Phoenix Mills Ltd, explains that this investment is crucial, as their first goal is confidence building. “Once people are comfortable with the idea of being in a mall, we will expand our offerings,” he says. This will include open-air shopping options, which seems to be the way forward. On the up side, as commercial space frees up (because of rents and other factors), more stores are opening. Uniqlo India just launched two outlets — at DLF Avenue, Saket, and Vegas Mall, Dwaraka.

The upcoming festive season will be crucial for malls to make up for their losses. The décor is already on point to tempt family selfies — such as a 50-foot diya in Phoenix MarketCity’s central atrium — but what else can we expect? Team Weekend travels across cities to find out how malls are faring, what people are buying, and if open-air shopping is winning over new customers.

When Express Avenue opened doors on September 1, 210 of its 220 stores welcomed customers. Chief Revenue Officer Munish Khanna credits this to their waiving entire rentals during lockdown (only common area maintenance costs were paid). “Now we have based rentals on sales percentages: if a store does 50% of what they did in October 2019, they can pay 50% of their rent,” he explains. As for footfalls, malls are seeing an upward trend week on week. At VR Chennai, a spokesperson says, “Genuine shoppers are what footfalls are about and we are seeing healthy trading densities that will likely improve with the onset of the festive season.”

When I’d visited Phoenix MarketCity and Palladium late last month, I’d noticed that only about half the stores were open. Today, however, mall representatives tell me that 90% of the stores are functioning. (The ones still shuttered are renovating or moving out.) Bluestone and Seiko have launched new outlets, while Birkenstock, Mad over Donuts and OnePlus are set to open by the end of the month.

Meanwhile, store assistants are taking on new roles, too. For instance, last month, an assistant at Express Avenue’s Montblanc boutique gave an Insta Live tour of the store and its latest products on Tata CLiQ Luxury’s Instagram handle. Earlier, this role would have been taken on by an influencer. As for tech, EA has invested in temperature-monitoring cameras; Phoenix has fired up their NHance app with directions to prevent people wandering aimlessly in search of stores; and Forum Vijaya Mall asks visitors to book a time slot via their social media handles or websites.

A visit to a mall after four months felt normal, and yet not. Talking points between my brother and I, as we went to 1 MG Road, included avoiding the elevator, using our feet to open doors and refusing clothing trials at H&M.

Gajendra Singh Rathore, Senior Centre Director, Phoenix MarketCity, says that since July there has been a decent growth in footfall — about 8,000 on weekdays and double that on weekends (36% of what it was last year). Interestingly, consumption has grown over 55% of what it was last year, with some categories like electronics and home furnishings recording higher sales. Their current offerings include home deliveries, agents for tele-shopping, and curbside pickup. Performances by bands are being planned too. Performances by bands (within government limitations for social distancing) are being planned too.

However, Uday Garudachar, who owns the Garuda mall chain — three in the city and one in Mysuru — has a different story to tell. From a weekday footfall of around 30,000, it is down to 3,000 a day. He adds that long-time tenants are unable to pay rent. “We haven’t given any concession and have not spoken about this at length yet. It is a tough situation all around,” he says. Despite these worries, there seems to be no concrete plan either for the long-term or festive season. Comparatively, shops on MG Road are doing better, says Bhoopalam P Srinath, president, Bangalore Trades Association, which represents about 120 stores there. “Namma Metro restarting has also contributed to business,” he adds.

“As an IT hub, Hyderabad has made a fairly easy transition to the online retail space,” says Kabeer Arora, architect and researcher for Hyderabad Urban Labs. The GVK One Mall in Banjara Hills, for instance, is leveraging WhatsApp for a contactless shopping experience. Assistant marketing manager Gerald Mathew says that apart from temperature checks and sanitisation of frequently-touched surfaces, “we have a Covid-19 response team [to spring into action is someone exhibits symptoms]”. When it comes to working with their retailers, he says they “spoke with them individually and offered each certain waivers. We have to support the brands and the flea market owners”.

Malls in outskirts areas such as DSL Virtue Mall, Uppal are enjoying a considerable increase in footfall. Mall manager Shahansha N says, “We employ a QR code system for shopping so that people don’t feel anxious spending too much time out of their homes. Most of our stores are anchor stores so this is easily handled as most people who shop here know what they want.” Sarath City Capital Mall, which is a sprawling 27,00,000 square feet across eight floors, has opened in a phased manner. However, they have not seen as much footfall as other malls such as GVK One, aside from the food court.

“Post Covid, retail design would take more of an experiential approach. With restrictions on touch and trials, stores need to create immersive experiences to draw in customers. This could be done through the use of AR or VR as well as creating exciting displays in the store. Ensuring good ventilation and light, creativity in terms of displaying products and good digital content are the way forward.”

“So if we narrow it down, we are not only trying to emphasise on the users’ attention to the product but also selling ‘safety’. Assurance of cleanliness and visible hygiene should be abundantly communicated. Possibly incorporate health and safety advisors into the design process.”

Delhi

Malls in Delhi opened in early June, giving them more time to prepare for the upcoming festive season. At DLF Emporio and The Chanakya, an omni-channel approach has been implemented. Prashant Gaurav Gupta, VP & Head, DLF Luxury Malls, says, “More than ever, it is imperative to maintain exclusivity to retain the fundamental role of luxury and balance it with the new ‘phygital’ experience, by taking the in-store experience online and the online experience in-store.” The most popular has been their on-call personal shopper for gift shopping, where customers browse via video call and then pick up their purchases.

Select Citywalk was open through the lockdown for essential commodities, says Yogeshwar Sharma, Executive Director & CEO. “Customers ordered [via WhatsApp] from our digital catalogue, featuring the latest from beauty, home, lifestyle and fashion brands, and got them home-delivered,” he says. A festive catalogue is coming up soon. They have also added concierge service and personal shoppers.

Meanwhile, DLF is partnering with FDCI to host the first-ever online Lotus Makeup India Fashion Week. “We have also partnered with top Bollywood celebrity stylists Aki Narula, Astha Sharma and Mohit Rai for one-on-one appointments [October 19-21],” says Gupta.

""For the first time, in the history of the world, the surface is under suspicion. Every surface. Be it the handrail of the escalator, the mall itself and even the produce in the store. In such a scenario, one of the most overlooked aspects of the offline buying experience, will become the centrepiece of its very existence — sanitisation. The sanitisation of the mall, the handrail of the escalator, that of the store and indeed even that of produce, will be central. Sanitisation will be the new frontier of customer experience. Airports and airlines are doing it. Malls and retail will have to do it with more robust rigour. A mere handout of a hand sanitiser will no longer cut it. Sanitisation will be the new luxury."" Swapan Seth, CEO, This Content

There seems to be a sharp divide between malls in South Mumbai (mostly deserted as they draw office goers and tourists) and those in the suburbs (where millennials and Gen Z are daring to step out). “Consumer behaviour has changed and though fear is still a factor, we are getting serious buyers now, so the conversion rate is high,” says Mukesh Kumar, CEO, Infiniti Mall, popular with the celebrity crowd.

At Growel’s 1O1 Mall, facilities like live shopping services and ‘Mall on Wheels’ — where a selection of brands are brought to housing societies — have been introduced. Additionally, it is also organising pop-ups for customers who are apprehensive of stepping inside stores. “About 70% of business is coming from online channels, with deliveries happening through mall stores. This reinstates the fact that omnichannel as a trend is here to stay,” says Sachin Dhanawade, COO - Retail & Real Estate, Grauer & Weil (India) Ltd, which operates the mall.

Bringing Bhaane to Chennai

The label Bhaane makes its Chennai debut at a pop-up at The Amethyst Room on Chamiers Road. The press note highlights that the contemporary brand for the conscious, urban millennial has contributed to culture, animal welfare and women’s empowerment. At the pop-up, expect lustrous clothes in wine, ink and charcoal colours, perhaps as velvet dresses and recycled polyester suits for men. It’s all ‘in anticipation of the bacchanalia to come’ with prices starting at ₹2,300. October 22 to 29.

Ajrakh uniforms by Sabyasachi

Stepping away from his trademark designer couture, designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee recently unveiled a line of uniforms for the Rajkumari Ratnavati Girls School in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan. They feature a blue knee-length dress with a round neck, 3/4 sleeves, and two patch pockets, along with maroon cropped elastic waist pants – with Ajrakh blockprints adorning the skirt and sleeves.

Maalgaadi’s e-store

Chennai-based design house Maalgaadi – that had its soft launch this week – has launched its digital avatar: MAALGAADi 2.0. Featuring the likes of designer labels Mati, Anushe Pirani, Wovhan, Fahd Khatri, Translate, among others, the brand aims to use its online portal as a sustainable design showcase. Also launched was there earth-friendly line for women crafted with Karunganni cotton. maalgaadistore.com

Hydrate with Murakami

Collabs are pushing the narrative, even more now than before. A popular one this season is the Perrier x Murakami tie-up, where you can now own a piece of the famous Japanese artist’s work – courtesy a bottle of sparkling water. Takashi Murakami’s flower motifs on the glass bottles of the French water brand, currently owned by Nestle Waters, will be available in India early next year. Chandni Kohli Dhall, CMO, Hindustan Liquids, the exclusive importers of Perrier in India, says, “Once the bottles are available in India for retail, we will be tapping influencers to create quirky content for us,” she says. Cheers to that.

Post-lockdown’s cycle craze

There’s been a boom in bicycle sales after the lockdown. Sachin Chopra, Founder & CEO, Alpha Vector, a brand launched in 2015, and present in 350 cities across 700 retailers, says that while they launched the website in May for online sales, this accounts for only 20%. He still sees old-school ‘cycle markets’ like Delhi’s Jhandewala as the way forward, because “Mall rentals are just way too expensive”. While “conscious purchases” like cycles will still be offline purchases, he says impulse buying, FMCG, and standardised buying (like, say, a ceiling fan) will shift online.

Eco passport alert

With eco-consciousness reaching an all-time high during the pandemic, brands are pulling out all the stops to fit in. Swatch updated an 80s watch with bio-material from seeds of the castor plant. United Colors of Benetton has launched an Eco-Recycle puffer jacket, where the jacket padding comes from recycled plastic bottles. And Adidas is seeking 1,500 volunteers to test their 100% recyclable, monomaterial, glue-free running sneaker, Ultraboost DNA Loop. Once the used shoes are returned to Adidas, they are washed, ground and melted to create a new pair. To participate, you must download the app and answer a quiz. How’s that for evergreen engagement?

Sari in a dress

Have you checked out Kumari, the label Malika Verma and designer Rashmi Varma launched late last year? Their sari dresses and Twice-Loved series, featuring pre-loved saris and vintage finds from across the country, now have an online home. At kumarisari.com, the young label encourages you to buy some of the unusual sari dresses and also bring in personal saris for some fancy treatment. Buy or barter garments, they say, adding that the occasion wear is accessible and under ₹25,000.

Fashion’s closing sale

The fashion weeks have begun, and while designers like Ravi Bajaj and Rajesh Pratap Singh showcase their creations via music videos and fashion films at LMIFW SS ‘21, there is a lot of interest in the second edition of the FDCI Designer Stockroom. With discounts of up to 70% off, this one will have participating designers with websites that load quicker, we hope. On October 19 and 20, at fdci.org.

Eyeing Shopper’s Stop

Shopper’s Stop is collaborating with actor Malaika Arora and celebrity makeup artist Daniel Bauer to create a talent show for makeup artists. EyeStoppers 2020 has seen professional makeup artists from across the country join in online, with the focus on creative eye makeup (for mask wearers) and therefore eye beauty products. There are master classes by beauty bloggers till October 18 and a #StopTheBias inclusivity campaign. It seems like the lifestyle retailer is making all the right moves to improve its online presence.

Multiplex advantage

Raichur gets its first multiplex next week, even as cinema halls reopen in many parts of the country after close to seven months. Are discounts on tickets, 50% occupancy, staggered show timings and social distancing enough to get moviegoers out of their homes? Mall owners hope so, as footfalls depend a lot on the multiplex crowd, even though many do not translate into retail sales.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/4k81zz/article32871908.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Amethyst,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/coming-up-in-indian-retail/article32871929.ece

1. Weekend picnics @ Sunder Nursery

The famed market at Sunder Nursery in Delhi resumed operations last month. While sampling edibles is on hold for now and stalls have been halved to ensure social distancing, the heritage park right next to Humayun’s Tomb is abuzz with eager shoppers. Organic produce, groceries, textiles and live food counters – think alcohol-free beverages with hibiscus, rose and eucalyptus – abound at this refreshing market organised by Meenu Nageshwaran of The Earth Collective. “Tables are placed six feet apart, sanitisers placed around the venue and there are designated hand wash areas,” she says, adding how they had close to 1,000 visitors on day one. From 8 am to 1 pm.

2. Craft Council online

While on-ground events like the Crafts Bazaar and natural dye exhibition are off the cards this year, Crafts Council of India is finally going online. “The pandemic has thrown open the doors for virtual platforms and kamalabycci.com will be launched in the coming weeks,” says Jayasri Samyukta, Joint Secretary. The site will feature some of their curated textiles and knick-knacks. We heard about a range of aranmula kannadi (hand mirrors) and can’t wait. Meanwhile, their Chennai crafts store, Kamala, will reopen on Oct 19. 9840700445

3. Open air markets @ Dastkar

In the news for their online store, handsondastkar.com and craft bazaar, Nature 2020, Dastkar has its hands full. The focus, says founder Laila Tyabji, was on those who had built up stock over the last six months and urgently required sales opportunities. “We will see a rebound from malls to melas. Not just because it’s safer shopping in open air venues, but people have started valuing handmade and indigenous products in these months of introspection,” adds Tyabji. Dastkar.org

4. Sunday Sante’s comeback

Founders of the famed flea market hope to be back in action by December. “We are looking at physical events in a few cities in December. People are looking forward to outdoor events, especially since they’ve been spending time indoors for the last few months,” says Bengaluru-based Harish Rao of Sunday Soul Sante. An online store is also coming up. sundaysoulsante.com

5. Virtual sessions by Karen Anand

The open-air whole foods market featuring fresh fruit, honey, organic produce and more is also expected to resume in January. January 2021. At the moment, founder Karen Anand is busy promoting vendors via Instagram live sessions on @marketsbykarenanand and is also looking at opening an e-commerce store. “We are now restarting distribution through select stores only,” says Anand, adding how the staff has been roped in for Ks Kitchen - her brand of gourmet sauces, conserves and dressings. karensfarmersmarkets.in

Mumbai’s go-to offline organic market - The Farmers’ Market - opened in August with a dozen sellers and “farmers and vendors were excited to resume operations”, says founder Kavita Mukhi. Visitors have been stocking up on organic seed bars, plump eggplants and even cafe specials like guilt-free cakes. Mukhi has started offering curbside delivery and Whatsapp bookings. “Visitors have grown by 50% since then but is still a far cry from pre-Covid days,” she admits.

“The pandemic has highlighted the importance of urban open spaces for recreation, mental health, and to enhance the liveability of a city,” says Aswathy Dilip, Senior Programme Manager, Institute for Transportation and Development Policy. She is part of the team that worked on the T Nagar Pedestrian Plaza in Chennai (conceptualised in 2011 and completed in November 2019, at an approximate cost of ₹38 crore). “As Covid-19 made it challenging for families to come together with almost minimal space for recreation, this street provided a host of opportunities for citizens to use the street as a public space,” adds Dilip.

Similarly, the Chandni Chowk Redevelopment Plan in Delhi is the first major commercial development in the city’s bustling shopping hub after 300 years. The plan is to decongest the 1.3-km stretch between Red Fort and Fatehpuri Masjid, facilitate free pedestrian movement, enhance greenery and transform it into a car-free zone. The project, launched in 2004, is nearing completion. Following suit, cities across the country are transforming existing shopping hubs into retail-friendly environments — Church Street in Bengaluru, DP Road and JM Road in Pune, SM Street in Kozhikode, MG Marg in Sikkim, to name a few.

New shopping rules

The pandemic, however, has changed the face of existing shopping areas, like Bengaluru’s Koramangala, where shuttered stores and empty windows are aplenty. In Commercial Street, the Smart Cities Mission, which began in May, is impacting footfalls because the roads are dug up. Mohammed Nazin, VP, Bangalore Commercial Association, says, “Business has been at 25% of what it was pre-pandemic.” In Delhi’s Hauz Khas Village, autos are not crowding around the boom barrier any more, and there are only a few people walking around. Ogaan has left its corner store and there are a several other ‘To let’ boards around. A couple of kilometres away in Shahpur Jat, blingy lehengas adorn shop windows, but there’s hardly anyone inside.

But people are adapting. Mahaveer Singh, 72, who has had a 1,000 gaj (yard) property in the Village for several generations, says he is looking at a monthly rent of ₹5 lakh for a 1,200 sq ft property he has culled out. However, he is clear that a boutique will not be able to pay these rates; perhaps a restaurant-bar can. His conditions: “Until December 2020, there will be no rent for whoever takes it now. The first six months of next year, they can pay half; thereafter, they will need to pay in full.”

Sarojini Nagar Market, that Mecca of discounts where even fashion editors shop, is crowded enough, but Mukesh Yadav, who has been at the market since 1998, says footfalls is down to 50%. “I am not getting any new stock; most of us are finishing off our old maal. And if I sold something at ₹200, I now have to sell it for ₹150,” says the Uttar Pradesh native, who went home to Jaunpur, with his family of four during lockdown. Down South, at Begum Bazaar in Hyderabad’s Old City, one of the State’s biggest wholesale markets, the pandemic saw a few voluntary lockdowns (since the Charminar area is prone to large crowds). Now, most merchants have migrated to WhatsApp for contactless buying.

Creating a safe bubble

Laila Tyabji, chairperson and founder-member of Dastkar, hopes open spaces will become the norm for shopping. “People usually say [the venue of craft fair] Nature Bazaar is very far [in Chhattarpur, in Delhi’s South West], but this time they said, ‘We realise how nice it is to have this space, where people can socially distance’.”

Creating more decentralised shopping areas — like Saket in Delhi or Vashi near Mumbai — should be the norm for open air retail streets, feels Siddhartha Benninger, Project Planner Centre for Development Studies and Activities, Pune. “Essentially, small commercial zones can help the community live relatively normal lives in an extended ‘bio-bubble’. I do not think there is a need for huge malls. Though they might achieve economies of scale for buyers and sellers, they do the same for germs and bacteria,” he concludes.

421,2020/10/16,Coronavirus | Novel test to detect loss of smell in asymptomatic patients,"IISER Pune claims test offers 82% accuracy among infected persons

Loss of smell, which is one of the symptoms of the novel coronavirus infection, can now be quickly and accurately measured using a novel method developed by researchers at IISER Pune.

Using a custom-built olfactory action meter, which determines how well one can smell, the team led by Dr. Nixon Abraham from the Department of Biology at IISER Pune, were able to identify people infected with the virus but have no typical symptoms such as fever, fatigue etc.

To access the olfactory functions of asymptomatic people, the researchers tested 34 patients admitted in isolation wards at B.J. Government Medical College and Sassoon General Hospitals, Pune. The researchers were able to detect olfactory deficits in 82% of people with asymptomatic infection. That only 15% of those with asymptomatic infection were aware of their inability to smell before participating in the test, highlights the ability of the new method to detect asymptomatic cases that might otherwise not be detected. The results were published in the journal EClinical Medicine.

The method has 82% sensitivity, 87% specificity and accuracy of 85%.

The team optimised the experimental parameters by first testing normal healthy participants. The test was performed on 37 healthy participants to assess their ability to detect 10 different odours at varying concentrations — 9.1%, 16.6%, 23.1% and 50% v/v. The odours were presented from lower to higher concentrations and the detection thresholds were based on the ability to detect an odour at two consecutive concentrations.

The ability to detect odours was also checked at 50% (v/v) concentration. The lower of these two concentrations was considered as the detection threshold for a participant.

All odours were sequentially delivered at a particular concentration level and then the concentration was increased to the next level. The sequence of odours changed with each concentration level. The odours were delivered for four seconds each with a gap of over 17 seconds between two odours.

Both healthy and asymptomatic persons participated in the tests wearing a face mask.

The researchers found that a majority of healthy participants were able to detect eight out of the 10 odorants at 16.6% v/v concentration, which is the second lowest concentration; the two remaining odorants were detected at 23.1% v/v concentration. These experiments identified the parameters for olfactory testing of COVID-19 patients.

People with asymptomatic infection were classified as having either olfactory deficit or deficiency based on their ability to detect odours at different concentrations. People are said to have an olfactory deficit if they are unable to smell at all four concentrations, and olfactory deficiency if they are unable to detect the odour at two or more out of the four concentrations.

“We also tested if the cognitive function to detect odour is impaired through olfactory matching accuracy,” Dr. Abraham says.

Here, the person is first exposed to one odour and later to another odour and the ability to detect and differentiate and recall the odour are looked at.

“Impairment of cognitive function is studied by looking at detection of odours, discrimination between two odours and working memory to recall the odours,” he says. “Only those who can smell odours at more than two concentrations were tested for cognitive function impairment.” The study found significantly reduced matching performances by those with asymptomatic infection compared with healthy people.

They found that 82% of the patient population (27 out of 33) and 13% of healthy participants (5 out of 37) had olfactory deficits. “Olfactory deficits can be seen even in healthy people and this can happen due to different reasons other than coronavirus infection,” Dr. Abraham clarifies.

Despite a few healthy participants exhibiting olfactory deficits, Dr. Abraham is confident that the new method can be used for mass screening as the sensitivity is 82%, specificity is 87% and accuracy is 85%.

“Our work has laid the groundwork to use olfactory fitness as one of the prime criteria to identify people with asymptomatic infection. The methods and parameters established by our study can potentially be translated into a sensitive, fast and economical olfaction-based screening assay that can be self-administered by large populations,” he says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/dgs4xv/article32873585.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-novel-test-to-detect-loss-of-smell-in-asymptomatic-patients/article32873586.ece
422,2020/10/16,Apollo Hospitals geared to administer 1 million vaccines daily,"Ramped up capabilities will be deployed when vaccine is approved by health authorities

Apollo Hospitals has ramped up capabilities to be in a position to administer as many as one million COVID-19 vaccines daily once a vaccine is approved by the Indian health authorities.

Strengthening of the cold chain supply to ensure delivery and availability of the vaccine across its network, comprising hospitals, clinics, corporate health centres and pharmacies, and imparting training to 10,000 Apollo employees, who will be stationed at its centres across the country, are key components of the plan.

“It will be our privilege to work with all governments, governmental agencies and healthcare networks to ensure that a large number of people get the vaccine, quickly and safely, as it becomes available,” Shobana Kamineni, executive vice-chairperson of the Apollo Group of Hospitals told media on Thursday.

She expected a major role for private healthcare after the government completed the process of inoculation initially through the public healthcare network. About 30% of India is roughly 30 minutes away from an Apollo pharmacy, which can then guarantee safe and widespread reach of the vaccine, if required, she said.

Noting that clinical trials of a number of vaccine candidates were underway globally, Ms. Kamineni said Apollo Hospitals would follow government directions on which of the approved vaccines must be administered. Ideally, however, it should be the doctor’s choice, she added.

On the charges that Apollo Hospitals would be levying, she said that while the cost of the vaccine would be as per the government’s direction, the administering charges would be “insignificant”, comprising the cost of consumables and a service charge.

A release said Apollo has secured a cold chain to manage 300 million doses per annum. A senior executive said that while 6,000 nurses and 1,000 doctors had been trained in safe vaccination protocols, an additional 3,000 nurses will be completing training soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/apollo-hospitals-geared-to-administer-1-million-vaccines-daily/article32865884.ece
