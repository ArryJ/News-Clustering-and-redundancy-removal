Researchers at Yale University have developed a single-molecule switch, a device that could be key to the future of molecular or small computers.

Single-molecule-electret, the switching device could serve as a platform for small non-volatile storage devices such as Read-only-memory (ROM). These small electronics are crucial to developing more advanced computers by replacing silicon chips with molecules.

Most electrets are made of materials that produce the sound in speakers and the pairs of opposite electric charges line up in the same direction. By applying an electric field, their directions can be reversed. The attempt has always been to make these electrets as small as possible.

Mark Reed, the Harold Hodgkinson Professor of Electrical Engineering & Applied Physics at Yale University demonstrated a single-molecule electret with a functional memory. His work, along with research of colleagues at Nanjing University, Renmin University, Xiamen University, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, were published in Nature Nanotechnology.

What is Molecular Computing?

Molecular computing is the science of using DNA, biochemistry and molecular biology hardware to build a computer. Instead of using silicon, scientists attempt running software with liquids, test tubes and living cells to reduce the size of circuits as much as possible.

Why replace Silicon?

Silicon microprocessors have been around in the computing world for more than four decades. But to build smaller computers, circuits need to be miniaturized. So, while reducing the size of the circuits, current flowing through the transistor starts leaking into other components, thereby, faulting the circuit and making it useless.

So, researchers are highlighting the idea of molecular computing due to its potential to pack more circuitry at cheaper cost onto a microchip than silicon. Few nanometres in size, molecules make it possible to manufacture chip sets that can hold trillions of switches and components in them.

What can replace Silicon?

Scientists are working on different possibilities, including DNA to replace silicon for molecular computing. It could be a breakthrough technology since a single copy of DNA sequence is large enough to print an entire encyclopaedia out of it.

DNA computing came into light in 1994 when American computer scientist Loenard Adleman used tools of molecular biology to solve a difficult computational problem. It was said that the method had the potential to outperform electronic computers.

DNA enables scientists to manipulate its solutions and work on millions of strands together in the laboratory. Just as computer stores information in the form of bits, DNA molecules are nothing but strings of Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, and Thymine. These four bits together can hold large amount of data.

It could be interpreted as a software that builds a human being from a single cell. DNA holds no limit to power since more the number of molecules, greater is its strength. Unlike traditional computers, DNA computing can carry out millions of operations at the same time.

For instance, a single cubic centimetre with 10 trillion DNA molecules could perform 10 trillion calculations at once while holding 10 terabytes of data. It is also viewed as a complement of quantum computing.

However, the number of possible solutions grow exponentially with the size of problems so even small problems would require large volumes of DNA to represent all possible answers.

There’s a long way to go before it could be achieved but the degree of miniaturization offered by DNA could be key to the future of molecular computing.

Along with DNA computing, others biological computing methods include membrane calculation, evolutionary calculation and virus calculation.

Where will it be used?

The early DNA computers are unlikely to replace silicon soon, but it will be used for advanced calculations and powerful computing by national governments. In addition to this, it could also lead to better understanding of other biological processes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/6ivysp/article32893004.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/molecule-computingjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/molecular-computing-dna-inspired-advanced-computers/article32892951.ece

2,2020/10/19,China gives $1.5 million worth digital yuan to select citizens,"The largest such trial to date in the world's second-largest economy had been hailed by analysts as a step forward for Beijing as it chases what has become a Holy grail among the world's central banks - the first central bank digital currency.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

China's experimental $1.5 million giveaway of digital yuan to Shenzhen citizens ended on Sunday with acclaim from currency analysts - and scepticism from some users saying they preferred existing shopping tools like the ubiquitous Alipay app.

Under the week-long programme, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) gave 200 yuan ($29.75) to each of 50,000 consumers selected in a lottery in digital “red envelopes”, echoing the country's traditional way of gifting cash.

The online wallet was accessible via an app, without need for an existing bank account, with payments accepted via smartphone scans in downtown outlets in China's fourth-biggest city, from luxury goods retailers to snack stores.

The largest such trial to date in the world's second-largest economy had been hailed by analysts as a step forward for Beijing as it chases what has become a Holy grail among the world's central banks - the first central bank digital currency.

“The event last week really means that the (digital yuan) has already moved from theoretical internal testing to real world practice,” said Wang Shibin, co-founder of cryptocurrency trading platform HKbitEX.

But this has sparked fears from some overseas observers: if the digital yuan, which operates outside existing financial infrastructure such as Swift, wins international traction, it could undermine U.S. dollar dominance of global payment systems.

The PBOC did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on how the Shenzhen pilot programme went.

Earlier this month, seven central banks including the United States, Britain and Japan, set out key principles for issuing digital currencies.

Raymond Yeung, chief China economist at ANZ, said the digital yuan would have greater effect domestically as by allowing authorities to monitor currency circulation more closely, it would help prevent money laundering. It could also allow more targeted monetary policy, or, in extremis, levying negative interest rates on cash.

He said whether ordinary people would shop with digital yuan rather than mobile phone-based payment platforms like WeChat or Alipay “all comes down to incentives, and which 'vendor' gives you more motivation to use it”.

Alipay, operated by an affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, and Tencent Holdings Ltd's WeChat Pay app dominate the business and have made China one of the world's most advanced payment markets.

'LATE START'

In Shenzhen's Luohu district, more than 3,000 shops from Dolce & Gabbana to supermarkets accepted the digital yuan last week to pay for goods in part or in full using special devices to scan QR codes embedded in a mobile app. It wasn't immediately clear how much of the total giveaway had been spent, or where.

Sceptical reactions among some Shenzhen recipients of the giveaway - long used to scanning phones to pay for goods with other systems - showed the central bank and government have work to do in convincing consumers of the benefits of a central bank-backed digital yuan.

“Alipay and WeChat Pay have been out for a long time,” said a shopper who gave only her surname, Zhong. “The new digital currency is similar to those so it's quite late to just start the trial,” said Zhong, who said she was an accountant.

Zhong said she might consider switch to the new currency in the future, depending on how convenient and secure it felt.

Attracting users will largely depend on incentives to lure customers from Alipay or WeChat Pay, already used to buy everything from basic goods to complex financial products, say analysts.

“It's especially important to offer convenience and other benefits to promote the use of digital yuan,” said G. Bin Zhao, senior economist at PwC China.

Beijing may bundle it with subsidies, pension accounts, or state sector paychecks, he says, but “for digital yuan to be popularly accepted, banks and other institutions need to invest heavily in applications, marketing and education.”

Another downtown Shenzhen user of the online wallet, who gave her surname as Yuan, echoed that notion, saying spending her digital currency gift was less convenient than existing options.

“I'm not planning on using it again,” said Yuan, who said she works in finance. “Unless there is another red envelope, of course.”

3,2020/10/19,Got any signal up here? Nokia to build mobile network on moon,"The first wireless broadband communications system in space would be built on the lunar surface in late 2022

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Struggling to get a phone signal at home on planet Earth? Perhaps you'll have better luck on the moon.

Nokia has been selected by NASA to build the first cellular network on the moon, the Finnish company said on Monday, as the U.S. space agency plans for a future where humans return there and establish lunar settlements.

NASA aims to return humans to the moon by 2024 and dig in for a long-term presence there under its Artemis programme.

Nokia said the first wireless broadband communications system in space would be built on the lunar surface in late 2022, before humans make it back there.

It will partner with a Texas-based private space craft design company, Intuitive Machines, to deliver the equipment to the moon on their lunar lander. The network will configure itself and establish a 4G/LTE communications system on the moon, Nokia said, though the aim would be to eventually switch to 5G.

The network will give astronauts voice and video communications capabilities, and allow telemetry and biometric data exchange, as well as the deployment and remote control of lunar rovers and other robotic devices, according to the company.

The network will be designed to withstand the extreme conditions of the launch and lunar landing, and to operate in space. It will have to be sent to the moon in an extremely compact form to meet the stringent size, weight and power constraints of space payloads.

Nokia said the network would be using 4G/LTE, in use worldwide for the last decade, instead of the latest 5G technology, because the former was a more known quantity with proven reliability. The company would also “pursue space applications of LTE's successor technology, 5G”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/dex22p/article32892109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/nasa,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/got-any-signal-up-here-nokia-to-build-mobile-network-on-moon/article32892110.ece

Exchange operator Euronext said it halted trading in all its products on Monday due to a technical issue, affecting equities trading in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris.

The widespread outage has hit trading in cash equities, derivative products and commodity futures across Europe.

“No one can trade at the moment, everything is on standstill,” said Mikael Jacoby, head of continental European equity sales at Oddo Securities in Paris.

The outage follows a severe one on the Tokyo Stock Exchange earlier this month, which brought stock markets in Japan to a complete standstill, in the worst ever outage for the worlds third largest equity market.

“We are working to resolve this issue and we will provide an update as soon as possible regarding the expected pre-opening time and resumption of trading,” said Euronext, which operates France's blue-chip index CAC 40.

A spokesperson for the company declined to provide further details on the reason or the expected duration of the outage.

5,2020/10/19,Irish regulator probes Facebook's handling of children's data on Instagram,"The first inquiry looks to establish if Facebook has the legal basis to process the data and whether it employs adequate protections and/or restrictions on Instagram.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has launched two inquiries into Facebook Inc after concerns were raised about the social network giant's handling of children's personal data on Instagram.

The DPC, the main data privacy regulator in the European Union, received complaints from individuals and had identified ”potential concerns” in relation to the processing of children's personal data on Instagram, Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle told Reuters in an emailed statement.

Both inquiries were launched last month, Doyle said in the statement.

Facebook did not immediately respond when contacted by Reuters on Sunday.

The Telegraph, which first reported the inquiry, said Instagram made the email addresses and phone numbers of users under 18 public.

The Irish regulator launched its probe following a complaint by David Stier, a U.S. data scientist, the Telegraph added.

The first inquiry looks to establish if Facebook has the legal basis to process the data and whether it employs adequate protections and/or restrictions on Instagram.

“This inquiry will also consider whether Facebook meets its obligations as a data controller with regard to transparency requirements in its provision of Instagram to children,” Doyle said.

Instagram's profile and account settings will be the focus of the second inquiry, examining whether the social media company is adhering to the regulator's data protection requirements.

6,2020/10/19,"Hackers pose as McAfee staff to trick users into installing malware, Google says","Chinese government-backed hackers posed as authentic service providers such as McAfee and GitHub to trick users into installing malware on their devices.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Chinese government-backed hackers impersonated as security provider McAfee’s staff to trick users into installing malware on their devices, a Google blog post stated.

The hackers would prompt targets to install a legitimate version of McAfee anti-virus software from GitHub, while the malware was being surreptitiously installed into the system.

Google’s Threat Analysis Group that works towards thwarting cyberattacks identified the activity and sent them a prominent warning.

The findings were shared with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Google said.

The threats come ahead of the U.S. elections, with the incidents of threats increasing over the months. Google sent 10,316 warnings about ‘government-backed attacks’ in the July to September quarter of 2020, it said.

In June, Google said it spotted phishing attacks against personal email accounts of staffers on the Biden and Trump campaigns by Chinese and Iranian Advanced Persistent Threats (APT).

These attacker groups targeted campaign staffers’ personal emails with credential phishing attacks and emails containing tracking links.

Another Chinese malware campaign was based on emailing links that would ultimately download malware hosted on GitHub. The malware was a Python-based implant using file sharing service Dropbox for command and control. It would allow the attacker to upload and download files as well as execute arbitrary commands.

Every malicious piece of the attack was hosted on legitimate services, making it harder for defenders to rely on network signals for detection, Google stated.

French energy company Total has developed a tool to determine solar energy’s potential of rooftops. Partnering with Google Cloud, the tool will help popularise the deployment of solar energy panels in households.

The tool Solar Mapper uses artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to extract data from satellite images. AI helps facilitates sharper and quicker estimation of solar energy potential than present tools, the company said in an official statement.

The tool will also guide households to understand what technology would need to be installed depending on solar energy requirements.

Researchers from Total and Google Cloud took 6 months to devise the programme. At present, Solar Mapper is said to provide nearly 90% coverage in France.

8,2020/10/19,Google Pixel 4a review: Another win for #TeamPixel,"Google continues to impress with the Pixel 4a equipped with an improved camera. That it is easy on the bank account is an added bonus

We often talk about the cult of Apple, OnePlus or Samsung, but Google’s impact on the smartphone community is not as discussed as it should be. Many — some may call them haters — will argue that the #TeamPixel movement of the past few years only has the impressive camera going for it, and that it is just another Android device.

Specifications Display: Full-screen 147.6 mm (5.8"") display with transmissive hole; FHD+ (1080 x 2340) OLED at 443 ppi; 100,000:1 super contrast ratio; HDR support; Full 24-bit depth for 16 million colours

Dimensions & weight: 144 x 69.4 x 8.2 mm; 143 g

Memory: 6 GB LPDDR4x RAM; 128 GB storage

Processors: Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G; 2.2 GHz + 1.8 GHz, 64-bit Octa-Core; Adreno 618; Titan M security module

Rear camera: 12.2 MP dual-pixel; 1.4 micrometres pixel width; Auto-focus with dual-pixel phase detection; Optical + electronic image stabilisation; ƒ/1.7 aperture; 77° field of view

Front camera: 8 MP; 1.12 micrometre pixel size; ƒ/2.0 aperture; Fixed focus; 84° field of view

Charging & battery: USB-C 18 W adaptor with USB-PD 2.0; 18 W fast charging; 3140 mAh

When Google started releasing smartphones that were high-performance and easy on the bank account, something Apple could not do for the longest time, the tech community started to notice. The 2020 addition to the ‘a’ series, as Google calls it, is the Pixel 4a.

Raise your hand if you could literally hear your heart break when, in 2019, it was announced that India would not be releasing the Pixel 4. The radar-powered Soli motion-sensing system uses a radar frequency not allowed in the country — which somehow Google did not anticipate despite India being one of its biggest markets. This feature itself largely sets the 4 series apart from the 3. Google had to adapt to launch the 4 variant in India.

While the anticipation before the launch of the Pixel 4a was not as palpable as that of the 4, it was no surprise that this particular model sold out on a certain e-commerce platform within just 30 minutes of its launch on October 16.

Pretty on the inside too

The Pixel 4a has an eye-catching display of Full High Definition+ (1080 x 2340) OLED at 443 ppi with a full 24-bit depth for 16 million colours. There is a small transmission hole for the 8 megapixel front camera as well, which is not noticeable at most times. The bezels are smaller to make the most of the display real estate offered by the device. At 143 grams, the phone is super light, especially given the ‘a’ series opts for a polycarbonate unibody build rather than the steel build for the flagship range of phones. One of the let-downs is that the Pixel 4a has Corning Gorilla Glass 3, which could have easily been upgraded to the 5.

While we are discussing visuals, as expected, the cameras on the Pixel 4a do not disappoint. Portrait Mode has a faster focus thanks to the upgraded Live HDR+ with dual exposure controls; the composition and colour balancing are crystal clear and true-to-life. If you are keen on making printable memories with minimal creative direction, this is right up your alley. Night Mode is given a new life here as the Live HDR+ feature offers up a preview of your shot before you take it.

One of the most exciting additions to the Pixel 4a is that, like the 4, it has astrophotography capabilities thanks to a combination of integrated long exposure and the in-built AI. Sure, this was difficult to test in cloudy and rain-sodden Hyderabad lately but the basic camera itself has improvements, which show major progress.

For example, the device’s Super Res Zoom is intact and more responsive. To clearly shoot a subject about seven feet away, I did not have to move an inch; I only had to tilt the camera for right framing.

Under the hood

The best part of Pixel 4a is Android 11, which comes with a lot more control for the user, security-wise. The world shouted, for a really long time, and Google finally listened. From the get-go, I was able to control which apps had access to what mediums of data and how much of that data, and I was able to seamlessly switch those settings up as desired without too much fuss.

Pixel 4a’s 3,140 mAh battery at first glance might not seem particularly exciting, given the most inexpensive smartphones have at least a 4,000mAh strength, but Pixel’s standard Adaptive Battery keeps the device going for a full day, adjusting power distribution depending on your activity. Powered centrally by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G chipset, the device is whip-fast and enables the improved and more intuitive Google Assistant to make the user experience more seamless.

Ultimately, the Pixel 4a is a competitive addition to the already bustling budget-friendly smartphone segment, occupied by the OnePlus Nord, iPhone SE and Samsung M51. You could give the Pixel 4a a shot if you are on the lookout for something under ₹45,000 packed with the richness of a flagship phone.

10,2020/10/19,Police raid Islamist groups over teacher’s beheading,"People known for hate speech targeted

French police on Monday swooped on radical Islamist groups three days after the beheading of a teacher, who had shown his pupils satirical cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.

The raids came a day after tens of thousands of people took part in rallies countrywide to honour teacher Samuel Paty and defend freedom of expression, including the right to show cartoons regarded by many Muslims as insulting.

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said the swoop on Islamist networks was designed to send a message that “enemies of the Republic” would not enjoy “a minute’s respite”.

Sources close to the operation said that individuals targeted in the operation were known to the police for radical preachings or hate speech.

Mr. Darmanin said the government would also tighten the noose on NGOs with links to Islamist networks, including the high-profile Anti-Islamophobia Collective.

“Fear is about to change sides,” President Emmanuel Macron told a meeting of key Ministers on Sunday to discuss a response to the attack. “Islamists should not be allowed sleep soundly in our country,” he said.

11,2020/10/19,"It’s China that happens to have the cash now, says Sri Lanka Minister","Each country works out its own financing arrangements, says Ajith Nivard Cabraal, referring to Sri Lanka’s borrowing from China

While government critics and the Opposition in Sri Lanka raise concern over the Rajapaksa administration’s growing reliance on China, in the wake of Colombo seeking a new $700 million loan from Beijing, a State Minister has said it is China that has the “most amount of cash now”.

“In different times in world history, different countries have been the ones who have had the most amount of cash. And now it happens to be China, so China will naturally invest all over the world,” Ajith Nivard Cabraal, State Minister of Money and Capital Market and State Enterprise Reforms, told The Hindu in a recent interview, on Sri Lanka’s response to the economic impact of the global pandemic. “I think we should all respect that,” said the Minister, who was the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka during Mahinda Rajapaksa’s last term in office.

Amid the World Bank and International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) worrying forecast of a GDP contraction up to almost 7%, credit rating agency Moody’s downgrading of Sri Lanka by two notches to the “very high credit risk” category, the daunting $4.5 billion foreign debt due in the coming year, falling revenues and rising living costs, the Minister expressed optimism. Sri Lanka is exploring different options to repay its debt, including additional loans from China, currency swap facilities with India and China, and Samurai and Panda bonds, he said.

Mr. Cabraal’s remarks came a week after a high-powered delegation from Beijing flew into Colombo, and met President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is also the Finance Minister. China, which sanctioned a $500 million loan in March to help Sri Lanka cope with the coronavirus’s blow, is likely to favourably consider the Rajapaksa government’s request for an additional $700 million now, having pledged support to the island nation’s pandemic recovery effort. Further, Sri Lanka is also negotiating a nearly $1.5-billion currency swap facility with the People’s Bank of China. Sri Lanka owes China over $5 billion so far.

Trade practices

“Nobody says China has given $1.5 trillion loans to the U.S.? We are talking about $700 million coming in... these are the trade practices, financing practices, prevalent in the world. Each country works out their own financing arrangements in line with what they feel is best for them,” Mr. Cabraal said, adding, other countries such as Japan, the U.S. and India have also been big investors in Sri Lanka. The U.S., for instance, “is a very strong investor in Sri Lanka’s sovereign bonds. I met the Indian CEO forum here, and I was quite surprised that there are more than 50 in Indian CEOs here.”

‘Different sources’

Government critics, including former Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, has urged the Rajapaksa administration to engage the IMF, rather than fall into a “Chinese debt trap”, but the government has ruled out an IMF bailout.

The rapid credit facility that the government had earlier sought from the multilateral lender is yet to come through. Expressing displeasure, Mr. Cabraal said: “Rapid means rapid, no. Where is rapid in October when the accident occurred in March,” adding the government would still talk to the IMF.

While President Rajapaksa has vowed to disprove the “Chinese debt trap analysis”, few other sources seem as willing to lend readily. As for India, the Reserve Bank of India signed a $400 million swap agreement with Sri Lanka in July, to help boost Sri Lanka’s foreign reserves, and is perusing a further $1 billion requested by Sri Lanka. New Delhi is also yet to respond to PM Rajapaksa’s request for a debt moratorium — Sri Lanka owes $ 960 million to India — but Mr. Cabraal observed bilateral moratoriums cannot help much. “Emerging nations have all faced external sector stresses, which is not peculiar to Sri Lanka. Recently, some of the international agencies had provided some support for around 70 odd countries, which have been ad-hoc arrangements. This is a global problem, which needs a global solution,” he said.

Despite the external sector weakening significantly, Sri Lanka is “fortunate”, in Mr. Cabraal’s view. The country’s foreign reserves have “not been affected too much”, exports have “held firm” and remittances have been “pretty strong”. In September, Sri Lanka recorded over $700 million from worker remittances. Exports in July crossed $1 billion and the government’s move to restrict imports “has paid off”, according to Mr. Cabraal. “Our foreign reserves will be around $5.8 billion. I would say that is not an uncomfortable level.” A clearer picture will emerge only by end of the year, as the Department of Census and Statistics postponed the release of the second quarter GDP figures until then.

However, Sri Lanka’s challenge is far from over. It remains to be seen if the remittances will continue flowing in. Some 50,000 Sri Lankan migrant workers, who were employed in West Asian countries, want to return, while thousands lost their jobs and at least 67 succumbed to Covid-19 in their host countries. Domestically too, a new wave of COVID-19 infections is rapidly spreading within the garment manufacturing sector that is crucial to exports.

Falling revenues

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka’s revenues have fallen drastically, by an estimated LKR 440 billion (about $2.3 billion), also in the wake of tax cuts on imported items, prompting economists to emphasise a sound fiscal policy in the coming budget. Asked if the government was taking a fresh look at its tax regime to boost revenues, including considering a wealth tax that the IMF has recommended in its recent World Economic Outlook, Mr. Cabraal said: “You cannot make poor people rich, by making the rich people poor…we don’t want to put mansion taxes and these silly taxes which have actually crippled the more affluent people and remove them from the equation of providing jobs and providing support,” adding that the upcoming Budget, to be tabled next month, would reflect a “a balanced partnership”, where small and medium scale businesses will be supported, so they can extend job opportunities to the poor.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wwjoqt/article32895559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-SRILANKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/its-china-that-happens-to-have-the-cash-now-says-sri-lanka-minister/article32895560.ece
12,2020/10/19,Thai PM recalls Parliament as protesters raise pressure,"Demonstrators seek his ouster over last year’s ‘rigged’ poll

Thailand’s embattled premier called on Monday for a special session of Parliament as protesters planned more rallies to demand his resignation, the release of jailed activists, and reforms to the monarchy.

Tens of thousands of mostly young protesters have taken to the streets in the past week in defiance of an emergency decree banning gatherings of more than four people.

Police said around 20,000 people protested across the capital on Sunday, although activists and local media estimated much bigger crowds.

As they prepared to rally again on Monday, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha said Parliament — currently in recess — would be recalled to discuss how to reduce tensions.

“We support opening an extraordinary session to solve this conflict,” he told reporters, warning protesters not to break the law.

“I request protesters rally peacefully. The government has already compromised to some degree,” he said.

The largely leaderless movement is calling for the resignation of Mr. Prayut — a former Army chief and mastermind of a 2014 coup — as well as the re-writing of the military-drafted Constitution they say rigged last year’s election in his favour.

13,2020/10/19,US presidential elections | Candidates woo voters in key States as election day looms,"Trump says the vote is between recovery and depression

With just over a fortnight to go until Election Day, U.S. President Donald Trump and his opponent Democratic nominee Joe Biden continued to woo voters in ‘battleground states’. However, the commonalities mostly stopped there – the two candidates delivered sharply contrasting messages on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. economy and questions of policing and racial justice.

Also read: In split-screen town halls, Donald Trump and Joe Biden squabble over coronavirus response

On Sunday afternoon Mr Biden held a drive-in campaign event in Durham, North Carolina, while Mr Trump flew to a rally in Sun City, Nevada, after campaigning in Wisconsin and Michigan.

“Folks, times are hard, unemployment’s way up,” Mr Biden said, linking job security to his own childhood in Scranton Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware; Mr. Biden’s father had to move for his father’s work.

Mr. Biden said nearly 4,000 people had died of COVID-19 in North Carolina and over 217,000 had died in the U.S. but Mr Trump was insisting that the U.S. had “turned the corner.”

“And my grandfather would say, ‘This guy’s gone around the bend if he thinks we turned the corner,’” Mr Biden said.

“Experts say we’re likely to lose as many as 200,000 additional lives nationwide between now and the end of the year. All because this President cares more about his Park Avenue perspective on the world, the stock market, than he does about you. Because he refuses to follow the science,” Mr Biden said, emphasizing what has become a theme for him in this campaign: his working class roots in Scranton versus Mr Trump’s wealthy “Park Avenue” background.

With regard to racial tensions and racial justice, Mr Biden said the country needed “hope” and “to heal” and “needed to deescalate tensions, open lines of communication.”

“But true justice is also about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability,” Mr Biden said.

Mr. Trump beat 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hilary Clinton in North Carolina by almost 4 percentage points. Mr Biden currently leads polling in the state by an average of 2.7% according to Real Clear Politics.

Mr. Trump, speaking later on Sunday on the other side of the country (in Nevada), struck a different chord on similar issues. He spoke about “rounding the turn”[ turning the corner] on the pandemic.

Mr. Trump said that Americans were having the “best year you ever had” before the pandemic hit the country.

“And then we closed it [ the country ] up and we saved over 2 million lives by doing what we did. They don’t like to say that. We did a great job,” he said. Studies (including one from Columbia University for instance) have shown that had the U.S.’s March lockdown and social distancing guidelines been in place one week earlier, tens of thousands of lives could have been saved. The 2 million figure Mr Trump repeatedly cites refers to the worst-case scenario result from a White House disease model released in the early days of the pandemic.

Mr. Trump told the crowd in Carson City that he felt like Superman after receiving an infusion of monoclonal antibodies. Mr Trump had, as per reports, considered wearing and then revealing a Superman T-shirt under his button-down shirt (like Clark Kent transforming into Superman), when he left Walter Reed hospital some weeks ago where he was being treated for COVID-19.

He said the elections were a choice between a “Trump super recovery” and “Biden depression”; between “strong borders” and “no borders”; between “supporting the police” and “defunding the police.”

“Between delivering a vaccine in record time to kill the virus or a Biden shutdown to kill the economy,” Mr. Trump said. The president mocked Mr. Biden’s approach to the pandemic.

“He will surrender your future to the virus,” Mr. Trump said.

He said Americans had voted in 2016 to “fire” the “decrepit political establishment.” [ Mr Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million but won the electoral college vote].

“And you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first”, Mr Trump said, calling the Biden family a “criminal enterprise.”

At one point, when Mr. Trump made unsubstantiated allegations of corruptions against Mr Biden and his son Hunter, the crowd chanted “LOCK HIM UP!”

Mr. Biden leads Mr. Trump in Nevada by an average of 5.2 percentage points (49% versus 43.8%) according to Real Clear Politics. Democrats have won the state since 2004, with Ms. Clinton narrowly beating Mr Trump there in 2016. However, Democrats took seats from Nevada Republicans in the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3kj0h7/article32895492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-ELECTION2020PUERTORICANVOTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/candidates-woo-voters-in-key-states-as-election-day-looms/article32895493.ece
14,2020/10/19,Morales aide claims win in Bolivia vote,"Luis Arce looks set to win presidential election, marking a comeback for the socialist party

Bolivia’s socialist candidate Luis Arce looks set to win the country’s presidential election without the need for a run-off, an unofficial count indicated on Monday, putting the leftwing party of Evo Morales on the brink of a return to power.

The quick-count from pollster Ciesmori, released by Bolivian TV channel Unitel around midnight on Sunday, showed Mr. Arce had 52.4% of valid votes, more than 20 percentage points above the second place centrist rival Carlos Mesa, who had 31.5%.

Still counting

The official count had reached just 5% of votes cast, and exit polls had been delayed hours after polls closed, leaving Bolivians in the dark about the election result. A candidate needs 40% of the votes and a 10-point lead to win outright.

“All the data known so far indicate that there has been a victory for the Movement for Socialism,” Mr. Morales, who handpicked Mr. Arce and has been closely advising the campaign, said in a press conference in Buenos Aires.

Mr. Arce, a former Economy Minister under Mr. Morales, sounded confident of victory without explicitly claiming the win at his own press conference shortly after midnight in the Bolivian capital La Paz.

“We are going to work, and we will resume the process of change without hate,” Mr. Arce told reporters. “We will learn and we will overcome the mistakes we’ve made (before) as the Movement for Socialism party”.

Conducted amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Sunday’s poll was regarded as a test of democracy in the Andean nation after last year’s election was annulled after allegations of vote rigging, which sparked bloody protests and led to Mr. Morales quitting after almost 14 years in power.

Jeanine Anez, the conservative interim President who took over in a power vacuum last year, said that it appeared Mr. Arce was the election winner and offered her congratulations.

Morales returns?

The election outcome, if confirmed, is chastening for the country’s conservatives and will likely bolster the image of Mr. Morales, the socialist indigenous leader whose shadow still looms large over the country despite him living in exile in Argentina since last year’s disputed election.

Mr. Morales was an iconic and long-lasting figure in a wave of leftist Presidents in the region over the last two decades, and the Bolivian election is a litmus test of the left’s abiding clout in Latin America.

“The vote is set to be the most important since Bolivia returned to democracy in 1982,” Carlos Valverde, a political analyst, said earlier in the day.

On Sunday, residents of La Paz, a city starkly divided by class and race, had voted peacefully but faced long lines meant to avoid overcrowding inside voting locations.

Many had said they worried the election result could lead to more violence.

“I hope everything turns out peacefully and that the next government can also provide the solutions that all Bolivians are hoping for,” said David Villarroel, voting in La Paz.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1xc1mu/article32895165.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-TOPSHOT-BOLIVIA-ELECTION-ARCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/morales-aide-claims-win-in-bolivia-vote/article32895166.ece
15,2020/10/19,Prosecutor recommends suspended sentences for Greece’s Golden Dawn party,"A total of 57 party members and associates were convicted on October 7, mostly for involvement in violent attacks and participating in a criminal organisation.

A prosecutor on Monday recommended that all former lawmakers of Greece’s extreme right Golden Dawn party who have been convicted and sentenced to prison for leading or participating in a criminal organisation should be allowed to remain free until their appeal has been heard.

Prosecutor Adamantia Economou argued that none of the former lawmakers was a flight risk or at risk of re-offending while they remain out of jail, and said most had a clean criminal record prior to this.

A final decision on whether the sentences will be suspended, pending appeal, is to be made by the judges' panel, in the wake of summations by the defence lawyers. It is expected either on Monday night or Tuesday morning.

The lengthy sentencing procedure caps a marathon, politically charged five-year trial that involved 68 defendants, dozens of lawyers and encompassed four cases, including the fatal stabbing of a left-wing Greek rap singer, and physical attacks on Egyptian fishermen and left-wing activists.

Party leader Nikos Michaloliakos and another five leading former lawmakers received 13-year prison sentences last week after being convicted of running the party like a criminal organisation. A sixth was sentenced to 10 years, while 11 other former lawmakers were convicted of participating in a criminal organisation and received sentences of between five and seven years.

16,2020/10/19,Pakistan police arrest son-in-law of exiled former premier,"The arrest of Mohammad Safdar comes as Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League party has joined a series of nationwide protests against the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Pakistani police arrested the son-in-law of the country’s exiled former Nawaz Sharif on Monday after he led a crowd in chanting against the military at the tomb of the country’s founder.

The arrest of Mohammad Safdar comes as Mr. Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League party has joined a series of nationwide protests against the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Police detained Mr. Safdar at a Karachi hotel room where he was staying with his wife Maryam Nawaz, who addressed a large anti-government rally Sunday.

Mr. Safdar on Sunday had visited the mausoleum of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who led independence movement to get a separate homeland from Britain in 1947 when united India was divided into two countries- India and Pakistan. Mr. Jinnah remains a revered figure in Muslim-majority Pakistan, with his tomb often drawing politicians and leaders.

While at the tomb, Mr. Safdar led a crowd in chanting- “Give respect to the vote!” That slogan is viewed in Pakistan as criticism of the country’s military, which ruled the country of 220 million people - directly or indirectly - for most of its history.

Chanting political slogans at Mr. Jinnah’s tomb is widely considered taboo. Police say they arrested Mr. Safdar, himself a member of the Pakistan Muslim League party, after receiving a complaint from a citizen alleging he was harassed.

The 70-year-old Sharif who has had a long uneasy relationship with the military, served as Pakistan’s prime minister three times. A court in 2017 ousted him from power over corruption allegations. Mr. Sharif has been staying in London since November after being allowed to receive medical treatment abroad.

17,2020/10/19,Explained | How does China's digital yuan work?,"Under the trial programme, the central bank distributed “red envelopes” in the form of online wallets containing 200 digital yuan ($29.75) each to 50,000 randomly selected consumers

China on Sunday concluded its largest pilot project to date for a central bank-backed digital yuan, with analysts saying the trial extended its lead in the global race to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Under the trial programme, the central bank distributed “red envelopes” - a reference to China's traditional way of gifting cash - in the form of online wallets containing 200 digital yuan ($29.75) each to 50,000 randomly selected consumers.

Below are details of how China is working to develop its digital currency.

What has happened in China so far on rolling out digital yuan?

China's digital yuan is probably the most advanced of the several CBDC initiatives that are being developed around the world.

Central banks, including the People's Bank of China (PBOC), are concerned about cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or private projects like Facebook's Libra gaining widespread traction, restricting central bank control of flows of funds.

The PBOC been working on its digital yuan programme since 2014, though it released few details until last year. Some crucial aspects like an estimated launch timeline remain undisclosed.

A series of pilot programmes, most notably in Shenzhen in October 2020 have shown that the digital yuan, can work on the ground when paying for goods.

Lifestyle apps including ride hailer Didi Chuxing and food delivery company Meituan Dianping have also been involved in the trials.

How does it work?

From a user perspective, it is rather like China's existing commercial digital payment methods, like Alipay and We Chat Pay: users download digital wallets in which they can store their funds, and which generate a QR code that can be scanned by payment terminals in shops.

The system is more complicated than that, however. The digital yuan is designed to replace cash in circulation, such as coins and bank notes, not money deposited long-term in bank accounts.

Commercial banks will have a role in distributing the digital currency to users, and to do so they must deposit exactly the same amount of their reserves with the PBOC as the digital yuan they distribute.

Both commercial bank distributors and the central bank will keep databases tracking the flows of digital yuan from user to user, something that they cannot do as effectively with coins or banknotes.

Unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, the digital yuan will not use blockchain, distributed ledger technology which allows transactions to be validated without the need for banks.

What effect will it have?

Widespread use of the digital yuan would give Chinese policy makers greater visibility into how money flows around China's economy.

This would help them track any illicit flows of funds, such as money laundering or terrorist financing, and it would also allow them to experiment by targeting monetary policy interventions on specific economic classes, regions or other groups.

In extreme economic circumstances, it would also allow them to have negative interest rates for cash.

China has a long-standing aim of internationalising its currency, and in time, the digital yuan may help with this initiative, making it easier to encourage users in other countries to use the yuan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/o8y0h4/article32892438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YUAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-how-does-chinas-digital-yuan-work/article32892333.ece
18,2020/10/19,First commercial passenger flight from UAE lands in Israel,"Etihad Airways Flight No. 9607 landed at Israel’s Ben-Gurion international airport just after 7 a.m

The first commercial passenger flight to Israel by a carrier from the United Arab Emirates landed near Tel Aviv on Monday, further cementing a normalisation deal between the two countries.

Etihad Airways Flight No. 9607 landed at Israel’s Ben-Gurion international airport just after 7 a.m. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner departed for Abu Dhabi later Monday with an Israeli travel and tourism delegation on board, according to an Etihad statement.

Etihad said it plans regular passenger flights between the countries in the future and was launching a dedicated Hebrew website.

Etihad previously sent to Tel Aviv an unmarked cargo plane flying aid to assist the Palestinians in fighting the coronavirus. In August, a Star of David-adorned El Al plane flew from Israel to Abu Dhabi, carrying a high-ranking American and Israeli delegation in the first-ever direct commercial passenger flight between the two countries.

Israel and the UAE announced in August they had agreed to normalise ties, setting off a flurry of business, banking and intergovernmental agreements, along with an end to a longstanding boycott by the UAE against Israel.

Nearby Gulf monarchy Bahrain also signed an agreement on September 15 at the White House alongside the UAE to normalise relations with Israel. The UAE and Bahrain are the third and fourth Arab states to establish ties with Israel. Egypt and Jordan signed peace treaties with Israel in 1979 and 1994, respectively.

An Israeli delegation flew to Bahrain on Sunday to formalise that deal.

The so-called Abraham Accords brought long-clandestine ties between Israel and several Gulf states — forged in recent years over a shared concern over regional rival Iran — into the open.

The US-brokered normalisation agreements have outraged the Palestinians, whose leaders have called the deals a betrayal of a longtime Arab stance that recognition of Israel would come only after Palestinians obtain an independent state of their own.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ok1doi/article32603021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14IN-ISRAEL-GULFUSA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/first-commercial-passenger-flight-from-uae-lands-in-israel/article32891667.ece
19,2020/10/19,U.S. envoy warns new violence threatens Afghan peace process,"Zalmay Khalilzad’s comments come as renewed fighting for days has plagued Afghanistan’s southern Helmand province

The U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan warned on Monday that distressingly high levels of violence threaten to derail the ongoing peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.

Zalmay Khalilzad’s comments come as renewed fighting for days has plagued Afghanistan’s southern Helmand province, a longtime Taliban stronghold. The Taliban this Friday agreed to halt its attacks on condition of the U.S. stopping its air strikes in the area.

But then came a suicide car bombing Sunday that killed at least 13 people and wounded around 120 others in Afghanistan’s western Ghor province. Though no one claimed responsibility for the bombing, suspicion immediately fell on the Taliban.

“Violence has stalked Afghans for far too long. It has robbed far too many Afghans of their loved ones,” Mr. Khalilzad wrote on Twitter. ""The tragedy in Ghor today is the most recent example.""

He added: “The belief that says violence must escalate to win concessions at the negotiating table is very risky. Such an approach can undermine the peace process and repeats past miscalculations by Afghan leaders”.

The Taliban offered no immediate reaction to Mr. Khalilzad’s tweets. However, it issued a statement Sunday over the U.S. air strikes targeting Helmand province. The Taliban warned that all responsibility and consequences from continuation of such actions shall fall squarely on the shoulders of the American side.

Omer Zwak, a spokesman for Helmand’s provincial governor, said on Monday there were still gun battles in a few areas of the province’s Nad Ali and Nawa districts. The Afghan air force separately conducted limited air strikes to support Afghan forces trying to retake Taliban-held areas, Zwak said.

The peace talks in Qatar between the Taliban and Afghan government negotiators began in September, but after a ceremonious start they became bogged down, mainly in the minutiae of Islamic jurisprudence.

This current round of negotiations come after a deal in February between the U.S. and the Taliban that seeks to end America’s longest war.

Despite the challenges, the ongoing talks represent the most-serious effort yet at ending decades of war in Afghanistan that followed the 2001 U.S.-led invasion that toppled its Taliban government, which then was hosting al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden who planned the September 11 attacks.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/j3hhi2/article32633416.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ZALMAYKHALILZAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-envoy-warns-new-violence-threatens-afghan-peace-process/article32891061.ece
20,2020/10/19,China's economy accelerates as virus recovery gains strength,"It is the only major economy that is expected to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan shrinks.

China’s shaky economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is gaining strength as consumers return to shopping malls and auto dealerships while the United States and Europe endure painful contractions.

The world’s second-largest economy expanded by 4.9% over a year ago in the three months ending in September, official data showed Monday. Retail spending rebounded to above pre-virus levels for the first time and factory output rose, boosted by demand for exports of masks and other medical supplies.

The recovery is broadening out and becoming less reliant on government stimulus, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. He said growth is “still accelerating” heading into the present quarter.

China, where the pandemic began in December, became the first major economy to return to growth after the ruling Communist Party declared the disease under control in March and began reopening factories, shops and offices.

It is the only major economy that is expected to grow this year while activity in the United States, Europe and Japan shrinks.

The Chinese economy expanded by 3.2% over a year earlier in the three months ending in June, rebounding from the previous quarter’s 6.8% contraction, its worst performance since at least the mid-1960s.

Steady recovery

The economy “continued the steady recovery,” the National Bureau of Statistics said in a report. However, it warned, “the international environment is still complicated and severe.” It said China faces great pressure to prevent a resurgence of the virus.

Authorities have lifted curbs on travel and business but visitors to government and other public buildings still are checked for the virus’s telltale fever. Travelers arriving from abroad must be quarantined for two weeks.

Last week, more than 10 million people were tested for the virus in the eastern port of Qingdao after 12 cases were found there. That broke a two-month streak with no virus transmissions reported within China.

Industrial production rose 5.8% over the same quarter last year, a marked improvement over the first half’s 1.3% contraction. Chinese exporters are taking market share from foreign competitors that still are hampered by anti-virus controls.

Retail sales rose 0.9% over a year earlier. That was up from a 7.2% contraction in the first half as consumers, already anxious about a slowing economy and a tariff war with Washington, put off buying. Online commerce rose 15.3%.

In a sign demand is accelerating, sales in September rose 3.3%.

""China’s recovery in private consumption is gathering momentum,” said Stephen Innes of AxiCorp in a report.

Faring better

China has reported 4,634 coronavirus deaths and 85,685 confirmed cases, plus three suspected cases.

Economists say China is likely to recover faster than other major economies due to the ruling party’s decision to impose the most intensive anti-disease measures in history. Those temporarily cut off most access to cities with a total of 60 million people.

The International Monetary Fund is forecasting China’s economic growth at 1.8% this year while the U.S. economy is expected to shrink by 4.3%. The IMF expects a 9.8% contraction in France, 6% in Germany and 5.3% in Japan.

Private sector analysts say as much as 30% of China’s urban workforce, or up to 130 million people, may have lost their jobs at least temporarily. They say as many as 25 million jobs might be lost for good this year.

The ruling party promised in May to spend $280 billion on meeting goals including creating 9 million new jobs. But it has avoided joining the United States and Japan in rolling out stimulus packages of $1 trillion or more due to concern about adding to already high Chinese debt.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/oqamva/article32890707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THCHINASHOPPINGMALL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinas-economy-accelerates-as-virus-recovery-gains-strength/article32890708.ece

Indian Americans held a Get out the Vote (GOTV) rally in the US State of California in support of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris for the November 3 elections.

“For the future of this and next the generation of Indian Americans and fulfill our American dream, it is very important to vote for Biden and Harris this election,” eminent hotelier Ashok Bhatt said at the GOTV rally organised on Sunday by entrepreneur couple Ajay and Vinita Bhutoria.

“Electing Harris as the first woman vice president of the country is history in the making,” Mr Bhatt said.

The event was attended by business owners, teachers, doctors, entrepreneurs, elected officials, community leaders, and students.

There are over 1.3 million Indian Americans in the battleground States of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Nevada.

“I don’t think anybody’s debating this one is probably the most important election of our lifetime... there’s so much at stake. All at once. Right now, in our country, we are facing front and centre at least four crises that have converged,” Bhutoria said.

He said that the country is currently facing public health crisis, economic crisis, racial injustice and climate change.

“It is important for all of us to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, especially I appeal to all Indo-Americans in battleground States to vote for Biden, Harris,” he said. Later the participants of the rally also did phone banking and outreach in battleground States.

‘Abki Baar Biden Sarkaar’

Yogi Chugh, executive managing director of the S5 Advisory, said that the South Asian community needs to do everything it can for a Biden-Harris victory.

“It’s time to put middle class families first and focus on our economy in which no one is left behind,” he said.

“We need a president who will unite the country, who care more about humanity and bring out our best — not one who stokes division and brings out our worst, said Prakash Thapa, a Nepali American small business owner.

Mahesh Nihalani, senior community leader, urged the Indian Americans to support Biden and Harris on the presidential ticket, adding that the two leaders are strong proponents of India-US relationship. “Abki Baar Biden Sarkaar,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y7x77g/article32890645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIDEHARRIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indian-americans-hold-get-out-the-vote-rally-in-california-in-support-of-biden-harris/article32890646.ece

Thai police said on Monday they had ordered an investigation of four news outlets under emergency measures imposed last week to try to stop three months of protests against the government and monarchy.

“We received information from intelligence units concerned that parts of the content and distorted information have been used and disseminated to cause confusion and instigate causing unrest to society,” police spokesperson Kissana Phathanacharoen told a news conference.

He said it was for Thailand's broadcast regulator and digital ministry to investigate and take appropriate action, adding that there was no plan to curb press freedom.

Putchapong Nodthaisong, a spokesperson for the digital ministry, said it had requested court orders to take down content by the four media outlets and a protest page, among more than 300,000 pieces of content it said violated Thai laws.

Prachatai, an independent outlet among those being investigated, described it as a censorship order.

“Honoured to report accurate info about human rights and political development in Thailand, we'll try our best in continuing to do so,” Prachathai English said on Twitter.

The Manushya Foundation, an independent group which campaigns for online freedom, called the measures an attempt to silence free media.

“Since the ban on protests did not work, the military-backed government hopes to create fear of telling the truth,” its director Emilie Palamy Pradichit said. “We urge free media to resist.”

The government ordered a ban on news and online information that could affect national security last Thursday as it also banned political gatherings of more than five people in the face of the growing challenge.

Protests have taken place every day since then, the latest drawing tens of thousands of people in Bangkok and across the country. Police gave a figure of 20,000 protesters in the capital.

“We will prosecute everyone,” deputy Bangkok police chief Piya Tawichai said, adding that 74 protesters had been arrested since October 13.

Protesters seek the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth, accusing him of engineering last year's election to keep hold of power he first seized in a 2014 coup. He says the election was fair.

The protesters have also grown more vocal in demanding reforms to the monarchy to reduce the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn. The Royal Palace has made no comment on the protests or protesters' demands.

Protesters have said they will demonstrate every day, but had yet to set out a plan for protests on Monday.

Mr. Prayuth has said he will not quit. Speaking at Government House on Monday, Mr. Prayuth said he supported a proposal for a special parliament session to discuss the situation. His supporters have a majority in parliament.

“We are just asking people not to do wrong and destroy the government and peoples property,” he said. “What the government needs to do is to protect the monarchy.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/maql74/article32890584.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKAPTOPIXTHAILANDPROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/thailand-police-order-media-probes-over-protest-coverage/article32890585.ece
23,2020/10/19,Baby born after pregnant mom fatally shot dies 4 days later,"A newborn boy delivered after his mother was fatally shot last week in Chicago has died, authorities confirmed.

Chicago police said on Sunday the baby died Saturday. He was 4 days old.

He was delivered Tuesday in critical condition after his mother, 35-year-old Stacey Jones, was shot twice in the back while standing outside her home on the city’s South Side.

She was eight months pregnant and pronounced dead at a hospital. Jones’ other two children were sleeping inside the home and were unharmed, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Jones moved to Chicago from Tennessee two years ago and had accepted a position as a Cook County probation officer, her father, Tommy Baker, said.

“You took something from my family, from me. You took my heart, my firstborn, the sweetest little thing,” Baker told the newspaper. “It’s a loss that I’ll never get over.”

24,2020/10/19,Twitter blocks tweet from Trump adviser downplaying masks,"Twitter blocked a post Sunday from an adviser to President Donald Trump who suggested that masks do not work to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

Scott Atlas, who joined the White House in August as a science adviser, had tweeted Masks work? NO, and said widespread use of masks is not supported.

The tweet violated a Twitter policy that prohibits sharing false or misleading misinformation about COVID-19 that could lead to harm, a company spokesperson said. The policy bans statements that have been confirmed to be false or misleading by experts such as public health authorities.

In such cases, Twitter disables the account until its owner deletes the post in question.

Mr. Trump has downplayed the importance of masks in reducing the spread of the virus, even after he contracted the disease, which has killed more than 215,000 Americans.

I don’t understand why the tweets were deleted, Mr. Atlas said in an email, calling Twitter’s actions censorship. He said his tweet was intended to show that “general population masks and mask mandates do not work,” and he clarified that the correct policy is to use masks when one cannot socially distance.

Mr. Atlas added that infections exploded even with mandates in Los Angeles County, Miami-Dade County, Hawaii, Alabama, the Philippines, Japan and other places.

Researchers have concluded that masks can control the spread of the virus, and public health experts have urged the public to wear them. But Mr. Trump and his team often go without masks while campaigning.

Mr. Atlas, the former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center and a fellow at Stanford’s conservative Hoover Institution, has no expertise in public health or infectious diseases. He has criticized the coronavirus lockdowns and campaigned for children to return to classrooms. Some scientists view Mr. Atlas as promoting dangerous theories around herd immunity.

Last week, Twitter and Facebook moved quickly to limit the spread of an unverified political story published by the conservative-leaning New York Post. The story cited unverified emails from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s son, and it has not been confirmed by other publications. There have been no new tweets from the Post since October 14, indicating Twitter may still be blocking the newspaper’s tweets.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/alxhbg/article32840004.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/twitter-blocks-tweet-from-trump-adviser-downplaying-masks/article32890099.ece
25,2020/10/19,"Bolivian socialist candidate set to win election outright, rapid count shows","Bolivia's socialist candidate Luis Arce is set to win the country's presidential election without the need for a run-off, an unofficial rapid count of the vote indicated, which would usher the left-wing party of Evo Morales back into power.

The quick-count from Ciesmori, released by Bolivian TV channel Unitel, said Mr. Arce had 52.4% of the votes, while centrist former President Carlo Mesa had 31.5%. To win outright, a candidate needs at least 40% of the vote and to beat the runner up by at least 10 percentage points.

After governing Bolivia for nearly 14 years, Mr. Morales eventually quit in the wake of the fraught 2019 election, which sparked bloody protests.

The election is likely to set Bolivia's political course beyond Mr. Morales, the socialist indigenous leader whose shadow still looms large over the country, despite him living in exile in Argentina since the fraught vote last year.

“This is a fundamental moment in the history of our country,” Mr. Mesa said as he cast his vote in La Paz on Sunday.

In pre-election polls, Mr. Mesa had been in second place behind Mr. Arce from Morales' socialist party, though polls then had suggested a second round run-off would be needed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eawe4j/article32889864.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BOLIVIA-ELECTIONTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bolivia-election-results-2020/article32889825.ece
26,2020/10/19,"Joe Biden not good for India as he could be soft on China, says Donald Trump Jr","The presidential elections in the U.S. are slated to be held on November 3.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is not good for India as he could be soft on China, U.S. President Donald Trump’s son said at an event to celebrate the “success” of his book that talks about graft allegations against the Bidens.

Forty-two-year-old Donald Trump Jr is leading the re-election campaign of his 74-year-old father. The presidential elections in the U.S. are slated to be held on November 3.

“We have to understand the threat of China and no one knows that probably better than Indian-Americans,” Trump Jr, told a select group of supporters from the community at the event in Long Island, New York.

In his book Liberal Privilege, he has documented allegations of corruption against 77-year-old Joe Biden’s family, particularly against his son Hunter Biden.

“When you look at our opponents in this race you think the Chinese gave Hunter Biden $1.5 billion because he was a great businessman, or because they knew the Bidens could be bought, and therefore soft on China,” he said.

Trump Jr was referring to the latest allegations of corruption against the Biden family as revealed by The New York Post.

“Therefore, (Joe Biden is) bad for India,” he said in his address at the meet and greet event along with Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is leading the fund-raising efforts of Trump’s re-election campaign.

The book, signed copies of which were handed out to participants of the event, reflects, according to Trmu Jr, on the “corrupt practices” of the Biden family.

Joe Biden has refuted the allegations of corruption against him.

However, Trump Jr said neither Biden’s family nor his campaign has issued any statement against the latest allegations and e-mails that have been posted by The New York Post.

“It is not just China, as they said China Inc with the Bidens, it as the Ukrainian, it was Russia and it was overwhelming because they know that he can be bought,” Trump Jr alleged.

That’s not going to bode well for people who are democratic minded or independent business people, the US president’s son said.

Praising Indian-Americans, Trump Jr said that the community is near and dear to his heart. “I understand the community pretty well,” he said.

The Indian community is hard working, family oriented and education oriented, Trump Jr said.

Indian-Americans, he said, have been looking at what the Democrats have been pushing or what the they have been ignoring for the last six months.

In his remarks, Trump Jr recollected the Ahmedabad address of his father Donald Trump during his trip to India early this year.

“When I saw the enthusiasm of my father with Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi you know, I used to think that Trump rallies were pretty big in America but that was the biggest Trump rally probably ever in India, Trump Jr said

Trump Jr has worked tirelessly at great and tremendous personal sacrifice to fight on behalf of this country and on behalf of his father “for all the right things that we stand for”, Guilfoyle said in her remarks.

Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee said that here has never been any U.S. president who has respected and treated an Indian prime minister or India or Indian-Americans like President Trump has.

Mason described Donald Trump Jr as a ‘rockstar’.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/l447wv/article32889530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKTWITTER-DONALDTRUMPJR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/joe-biden-not-good-for-india-as-he-could-be-soft-on-china-says-donald-trump-jr/article32889531.ece
27,2020/10/19,"Europe surges past 250,000 coronavirus deaths as Israel lifts lockdown","European nations have ratcheted up restrictions on daily life to tackle soaring infections, with a 44% increase in cases this week.

Europe passed the milestone of 250,000 deaths from COVID-19 on Sunday as Israel and Australia's second-largest city of Melbourne began to gradually ease their strict lockdowns.

European nations have ratcheted up restrictions on daily life to tackle soaring infections, with a 44% increase in cases this week.

Nighttime curfews on millions came into force in France this weekend and Switzerland required all its citizens to wear masks in indoor public places.

But Israel has managed to flatten its outbreak through draconian measures including a ban on travelling more than a kilometre from home.

The government lifted that restriction on Sunday and reopened kindergartens, beaches and national parks.

Israeli mother Talia Zinkin said she was initially unsure whether to send her son back to daycare. “But I felt he would enjoy being with other children,” she told AFP. “We have to try to live normally.”

In Australia, Melbourne has managed to control its upsurge in cases and officials were able to allow the city's five million inhabitants to leave their homes for more than two hours a day for the first time in three months.

While people will be allowed to travel up to 25 kilometres from home if they have valid reasons, restaurants and other businesses in Melbourne remain closed.

In Europe however, the increase in cases is reaching alarming levels.

Curfews respected

Europe's death toll makes it the second-hardest hit region after Latin America and the Caribbean, where fatalities have surpassed 350,000.

The United Kingdom remains Europe's worst-affected country in terms of deaths, accounting for almost one-fifth of fatalities on the continent.

It continues to struggle against the virus, with local officials resisting attempts by ministers to impose restrictions by region.

France counted nearly 30,000 new cases Sunday, close to Saturday's record 32,427 cases. Some 1,900 COVID-19 patients are currently occupying intensive care unit beds, out of France's total capacity of 5,800.

The government has introduced a 9 pm-6 am curfew for at least a month in nine cities including Paris, affecting 20 million people.

Those flouting the curfew face a fine of 135 euros ($158) unless they can prove they have a valid reason to be out.

“I'm coming back from the hospital... where my daughter is being operated on,” one man told a group of police officers, showing them a one-page document as evidence.

The measures fall short of the blanket confinements imposed in many countries earlier in the year -- but raise fears of new, severe restrictions across the continent.

The Swiss government said Sunday it would enforce mask-wearing in all indoor public spaces from Monday and forbid gatherings of more than 15 people, among other restrictions.

Several hundred people staged a protest against the new measures outside the government's Federal Palace in Bern.

Across the border in Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Sunday announced a series of new measures to tackle the rising number of virus cases, with restrictions placed on bars and restaurants and a push to increase working from home.

Arrivals at schools will also be staggered to help with social distancing and local festivals and fairs banned.

'Moving cautiously'

Two weeks ago, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had declared her country had beaten the virus again — but a new community case of COVID-19 has now been confirmed, punching a hole in her assertion.

Ardern's Labour Party won a landslide election victory on Saturday, with her government's handling of the pandemic widely credited as a factor.

In South Africa Health Minister Zweli Mkhize announced Sunday that he had tested positive for coronavirus, adding to over 700,000 cases registered in the country.

He is the fifth member of the government to contract COVID-19.

South Africa accounts for around 43% of the virus cases on the African continent.

Meanwhile, a new study in Japan has found that the coronavirus remains active on human skin for nine hours.

In comparison, the pathogen that causes the flu survives on human skin for about 1.8 hours, according to the study published this month in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal.

The research team tested skin collected from autopsy specimens, about one day after death.

They concluded that frequent hand washing is the best way to combat the pandemic.

“The longer survival of SARS-CoV-2 on the skin increases contact-transmission risk; however, hand hygiene can reduce this risk,” the study said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yteq5q/article32889475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKEUROPEECONOMICRELAPSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/europe-surges-past-250000-coronavirus-deaths-as-israel-lifts-lockdown/article32889473.ece
28,2020/10/19,Plan to retrieve Titanic radio spurs debate on human remains,"Could the world’s most famous shipwreck still hold remains of passengers and crew who died a century ago?

People have been diving to the Titanic’s wreck for 35 years. No one has found human remains, according to the company that owns the salvage rights.

But the company’s plan to retrieve the ship’s iconic radio equipment has sparked a debate: Could the world’s most famous shipwreck still hold remains of passengers and crew who died a century ago?

Lawyers for the U.S. government have raised that question in an ongoing court battle to block the planned expedition. They cite archaeologists who say remains could still be there. And they say the company fails to consider the prospect in its dive plan.

“Fifteen hundred people died in that wreck,” said Paul Johnston, curator of maritime history at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. “You can’t possibly tell me that some human remains aren’t buried deep somewhere where there are no currents.”

The company, RMS Titanic Inc., wants to exhibit the ship’s Marconi wireless telegraph machine. It broadcast the sinking ocean liner’s distress calls and helped save about 700 people in lifeboats.

Retrieving the equipment would require an unmanned submersible to slip through a skylight or cut into a heavily corroded roof on the ship’s deck. A suction dredge would remove loose silt, while manipulator arms could cut electrical cords.

RMS Titanic Inc. says human remains likely would’ve been noticed after roughly 200 dives.

""It’s not like taking a shovel to Gettysburg,” said David Gallo, an oceanographer and company adviser. “And there’s an unwritten rule that, should we see human remains, we turn off the cameras and decide what to do next.”

The dispute stems from a larger debate over how the Titanic’s victims should be honoured, and whether an expedition should be allowed to enter its hull.

In May, a federal judge in Norfolk, Virginia, approved the expedition.

U.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith wrote that recovering the radio “will contribute to the legacy left by the indelible loss of the Titanic, those who survived, and those who gave their lives.”

But the U.S. government filed a legal challenge in June, claiming the undertaking would violate federal law and a pact with Britain recognising the wreck as a memorial site. U.S. attorneys argue the agreement regulates entry into the wreck to ensure its hull, artifacts and “any human remains” are undisturbed.

The case is pending before the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond.

The Titanic was travelling from England to New York in 1912 when it struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic. The wreck was discovered in 1985.

Over the years, explorers have sent remotely operated vehicles into parts of the ship. During his 2001 expedition, film director James Cameron surveyed the area in a deckhouse that holds the telegraph equipment, according to court documents filed by the company.

People on both sides of the human-remains debate claim the issue is being played down — or up — to support an argument.

RMS Titanic Inc. President Bretton Hunchak told the government’s position is based on emotion rather than science.

“Issues like this are used simply to raise public support,” Mr. Hunchak said. “It creates a visceral reaction for everybody.”

The firm is the court-recognised steward of Titanic artifacts, overseeing thousands of items including silverware, china and gold coins.

“This company has always treated the wreck as both an archaeological site and a grave site with reverence and respect,” Mr. Hunchak said. “And that doesn’t change whether in fact human remains could possibly exist.”

Mr.Gallo said remnants of those who died likely disappeared decades ago.

Sea creatures would’ve eaten away flesh because protein is scarce in the deep ocean, and bones dissolve at great ocean depths because of seawater’s chemistry, Mr. Gallo said. The Titanic sits about 3.8 kilometers below the surface.

Yet whale bones have been discovered at similar depths, as were human remains on a 2009 Air France plane that crashed into the Atlantic.

“But generally that doesn’t happen,” said Mr. Gallo, who previously worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and has been involved in several Titanic expeditions.

Archaeologists who filed court statements supporting the government’s case said there must be human remains, and questioned the motives of those casting doubts.

Mr. Johnston wrote to the court that remains could be “within the confines of the wreck or outside in the debris field” in areas lacking oxygen.

In an interview, Mr. Johnston said the company doesn’t want “anyone to be thinking about human remains. They want people to think, ‘Oh cool. I have new artifacts to show the public.’”

David Conlin, chief of the National Park Service’s Submerged Resources Center, also filed a statement against the expedition.

Mr. Conlin told AP “it would be scientifically astounding if there were not human remains still onboard that ship.”

Eight sailors’ remains were discovered on the H.L. Hunley, a Confederate submarine that sank in 1864. And human bones were found at a first-century B.C. freighter wreck near the Greek island of Antikythera.

“Very deep, cold, low-oxygen water is an incredible preservative,” Mr. Conlin said. “The human remains that we would expect to find are going to be in the interior spaces that are more difficult to access, where the preservation will be both tragic and spectacular.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qs4btd/article32889469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TITANICARTIFACTSTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/plan-to-retrieve-titanic-radio-spurs-debate-on-human-remains/article32889468.ece
29,2020/10/19,"Imran Khan incapable and clueless, has betrayed people of Pakistan, say PDM leaders","This incapable and clueless Prime Minister will have to go home, says Bilawal Bhutto Zardari

Prime Minister Imran Khan is “incapable and clueless”, and his government is worse than a dictatorship, leaders of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an alliance of 11 opposition parties, alleged at its second rally here.

The PDM, which was formed on September 20, has launched a three-phased anti-government movement under an “action plan” to oust the Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) government.

Under the plan a number of rallies public meetings and demonstrations will be held across the country, before a “decisive long march” to Islamabad in January next year. The first of these rallies was held on Friday in Gujranwala near Lahore.

“This incapable and clueless Prime Minister will have to go home,” Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chief Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said at the Bagh-e-Jinnah, which was packed with people including supporters and workers of the alliance’s members.

History has proved that the biggest dictators could not survive and “what standing does this puppet have?”, Mr. Zardari said targeting Prime Minister Khan and added that “this is not a new fight but this will be a decisive fight“.

The rally here also marked the 13th anniversary of the twin blasts in Karsaz that targeted the homecoming procession of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007. The blast left around 200 people dead and several injured.

Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) vice presidents Maryam Nawaz and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chairman Mehmood Achakzai and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman were among the leaders of opposition parties who attended the rally.

The PPP also invited Mohsin Dawar, who heads the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), to address the gathering at the Bagh-e-Jinnah.

Maryam Nawaz, daughter of exiled former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, attacked the PTI government for declaring opposition leaders and her father as “traitors”.

“When answers are demanded, you say we are traitors,” said the PML-N vice president.

Fatima Jinnah, the sister of Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was also declared a traitor, Maryam Nawaz told the gathering.

“So do not scare us (by declaring us) traitors,” the PML-N vice president said and added that “when you (Khan) are pressed for answers, you hide behind the armed forces“.

“You bring the army into disrepute. You use them (army) to hide your failures. Who gave you this right? she asked.

Remember this, “one or two personalities are not the entire institution, but one or two people can defame the entire institution, and when they take cover of that institution, they cause heavy losses to that institution”, Maryam Nawaz said.

“We cannot respect those who violate their oaths. Is Nawaz Sharif wrong in saying that the army should not interfere in politics?” she said.

Mr. Sharif has accused the military and Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI of being behind his ouster as premier and installing their “puppet government” by bringing Imran Khan into power.

He made the accusations while addressing the first power show of the alliance of opposition parties in Gujranwala via video link from London.

Mr. Sharif, the 70-year-old leader of the PML-N who was ousted from power in 2017 by the apex court on graft charges, on Friday for the first time directly named army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and ISI head Lt Gen Faiz Hameed for interfering in the elections of 2018 to ensure victory of Khan.

Prime Minister Khan warned on Sunday he would be getting tough with the opposition and would ensure Sharif is brought back from London and put in jail for his deeds.

The Islamabad High Court through newspaper advertisements has asked Mr. Sharif to appear before it by November 24 to avoid being declared a “proclaimed offender”.

Maryam Nawaz said Khan’s speech was off a defeated man who was worried about the support the PDM had gathered in a short time.

Bilawal, in his speech, lashed out at Khan for “betraying” the people of Pakistan and said the rise of “facism” in the country had weakened Pakistan’s position on Kashmir and other issues.

Mohsin Dawar, who was one of the first speakers at the rally, termed the PDM as a “beginning for real democracy and civilian supremacy” in the country.

He criticised the incumbent government for filing “baseless cases” against political workers, whether they were from Waziristan, Gilgit Baltistan, Baluchistan or Sindh.

The cases, Dawar claimed, were filed due to political differences. The current regime is “worse than a dictatorship , he said.

“I consider this government to be worse than a dictatorship,” Mr. Dawar said.

The PDM will hold rallies in Quetta on October 25, Peshawar on November 22, Multan on November 30 and then a rally in Lahore on December 13.

Opposition leaders have announced that they would use all political and democratic options, including no-confidence motions and mass resignations from Parliament to seek “the selected” Prime Minister’s resignation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7ef67a/article31545730.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-IRAN-PAKISTAN-DIPLOMACY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/imran-khan-incapable-and-clueless-has-betrayed-people-of-pakistan-say-pdm-leaders/article32889263.ece
30,2020/10/19,"Armenia, Azerbaijan report truce violations","Ceasefire came into force at midnight on Saturday; both accuse each other of using artillery fire

Despite a second attempt at a ceasefire, Armenia and Azerbaijan traded accusations on Sunday of violating the new truce in their conflict over the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh.

The latest truce, which was announced on Saturday and took force at midnight, came after a week-old Russian-brokered ceasefire failed to halt heavy fighting between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces that broke out in Nagorno-Karabakh on September 27. The fighting and shelling has killed hundreds of people — both combatants and civilians — and marks the biggest escalation of a decades-old conflict over the region in more than a quarter-century.

Spectre of conflict

The recent fighting, involving heavy artillery, rockets and drones, has continued despite repeated calls for cessation of hostilities coming from around the globe. The escalation of fighting raises the spectre of a wider conflict that could draw in Russia and Turkey and threaten Caspian Sea energy exports.

Armenian military officials on Sunday reported artillery shelling and missile strikes by Azerbaijani forces in the conflict zone overnight. In the morning, “the enemy launched an attack in the southern direction,” and there were “casualties and wounded on both sides,” Armenian Defense Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanian said.

Azerbaijan’s Defence Ministry, in turn, maintained that Armenian forces used mortars and artillery in the conflict zone overnight despite the cease-fire and in the morning attempted attacks in several directions. The Ministry accused Armenia of using large-caliber weapons to attack the positions of the Azerbaijani army in two regions north of Nagorno-Karabakh along the border between the two countries, a claim Armenian military officials denied.

The Azerbaijani military also said it downed an Armenian Su-25 warplane “attempting to inflict airstrikes,” but Ms. Stepanian dismissed the statement as untrue.

Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a war there ended in 1994.

According to Nagorno-Karabakh officials, 673 of their servicemen have been killed in the fighting.

China and Taiwan traded accusations on Monday over a violent altercation that broke out between Chinese diplomats and Taiwan government employees at a recent Taiwan National Day reception in Fiji.

Both China and Taiwan confirmed the October 8 incident but each disputed the other’s claim of what precipitated the fight, which resulted in one Taiwanese staffer being sent to a hospital with a head injury. One of the Chinese diplomats also was injured.

The confrontation, an extreme example of the tensions between the rival governments, erupted when Taiwanese at the gathering tried to stop Chinese diplomats from taking photos of guests at the reception marking Taiwan’s National Day, a Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Joanne Ou, said.

""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemns the Chinese Embassy in Fiji’s staff’s actions which severely violates rule of law and norms of civilized behaviour,” said Ms. Ou. She said Taiwan had made a formal protest to the Fiji government.

34,2020/10/19,Bihar Assembly election | Migrant workers express hurt over lockdown but older voting loyalties also remain,"Every election hangs between the two points of mahaul (atmosphere) and samikaran (voter block equations), goes the popular wisdom on polls in Bihar.

Mrityunjay Kumar worked as a tailor at a small boutique in Noida when a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19 was announced. He found himself without a job and far from his home in the Mahmudpur village in Jehanabad district of Bihar. Like many whose travails were documented in visually searing images, he first tried to arrange a bus that would take him home, and later took a truck ride to Ghaziabad Railway Station, where he had been told that a train would take him to Patna.

“I waited 25 hours without decent food or drink at the station for the train, and finally made it home,” he told The Hindu outside his semi-pucca home. “Here, I was put into quarantine for 14 days in the village school,” he said, adding that he was waiting to leave, but saw no prospect of work very soon. The election season has caught him in the raw, and he questions the need for it right now. “If the polling booth does not have adequate protection, I will not cast my vote. The fear of corona led to the lockdown and forced me into all sorts of hardships, and now the government thinks nothing of holding polls in such a situation. They have stopped schools, colleges, festivals but elections must go on?” he asks, his anger at the Bihar government quite obvious.

He is reluctant to talk politics, but admits that the anger and despair of migrant workers from Bihar will be reflected in the Assembly polls. “Jaise bazaar, gaadi ghoda par asar pada, waise chunaav par bhi asar dikhega (just as the pandemic affected markets, transportation, it will affect the polls),” he says.

His point is supported by Saurav Kumar, a taxi driver from Mumbai, whom this correspondent met in Patna. Currently without a job and hailing from Paharpur village near Gaya, he says he will return to Mumbai once things are better there. He too squarely blames the State government for the plight of workers from Bihar, especially a statement by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on why migrants should not return to Bihar and spend the lockdown in the host States. “He should have spoken to the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Gujarat, ensured our welfare,” he says. Mr. Saurav Kumar is a traditional Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supporter and intends to vote for the Mahagathbandhan (“grand alliance”) candidate.

Mr. Saurav Kumar, however, does not speak for all migrant workers who moved back, not even for some others in his own village. Ramadhar Singh was on a visit home during the “Phagwa” (March) holiday just before the lockdown was announced, so he escaped the exodus. His view is that the events following the lockdown were triggered by the mahamari (pandemic) rather than individual governments. “Yeh toh mahamari ka dosh hai, isme Nitish Kumar ka kya dosh hai? (in a pandemic, how fair is it to blame Nitish?),” he queries.

Ranjit Kumar, who worked as construction worker in Prayagraj, moved back to Lodhipur village again in Jehanabad during “Unlock 3”, when he finally got some transport back to Bihar. Currently unemployed, he says that he will be voting in these polls and for electing back Nitish Kumar as he says that nothing he has seen of the alternative has been encouraging a shift in choice.

35,2020/10/19,"Bihar Assembly election | Nitish Kumar is the face of the NDA, there is no credible alternative: Bashishtha Narayan Singh","The Chief Minister has empowered oppressed sections like Mahadalits and women, who are his major supporters, says the JD(U) Bihar unit president

Janata Dal (U) Bihar unit president, Bashishtha Narayan Singh, stressed that the Assembly election is a straight fight between two major alliances, with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar having the clear advantage of being a recognised leader with a track record administration and reform.

Have things settled down in the NDA with regard to the Lok Janshakti Party?

Whatever happens cannot be predicted. We have said before that Chirag’s (Paswan) alliance is with the BJP, so this is between BJP and Chirag. The BJP has clarified that Chirag has left on his own so the matter is over for us. If you look at the tickets that Chirag has distributed, it has been to all sorts of outsiders. .

Also read: Only goal to serve people, says Nitish Kumar

This time round there are several alliances but I still feel the fight is a straight one between the two dominant alliances; vote katuas (spoilers) etc. do not have a long shelf life and are exposed soon. The NDA will win with two-thirds majority because the leader of the principal opposition party — Tejaswi Yadav does not have a record of credibility among the people. The RJD is still running on Lalu Prasad’s name rather than their current leader.

There is talk of heavy anti-incumbency against Nitish Kumar, starting from the Patna floods last year to how the migrant workers situation was handled. Your take?

Anti-incumbency factor is always talked about when a leader has been at the helm for a while. The opposition had set out a dushprachar (false propaganda) on the handling of the migrant issue, but after the administration not only conducted quarantine and welfare measures properly, the talk died down. The same is the case with flood relief. Bihar has one of the earliest disaster management departments in the country and managed to take care of flood relief even in a situation of a pandemic.

Also read: 2 big issues that put Nitish Kumar down in 4 places

Why is Nitish Kumar important? He is the person who has been able to empower and build confidence among sections of society which were oppressed like the Mahadalits. Politically, you can see that the longevity of Naveen Patnaik at the helm in Odisha and Jyoti Basu in West Bengal relate to the fact they are/were the face of their governments and the alternative face had no credibility. Nitish Kumar is the face of the NDA and there is no credible alternative to him.

Prohibition is said to have led to not only loss of revenue but also long term moral decline of society as it gives rise to organised crime as people still seek to drink. Does the NDA government have any second thoughts on this policy?

We are completely satisfied with prohibition. To know why, you need to speak to people who are around 30-45 years currently. They will tell you how in the past, during wedding ceremonies and such, there was open drinking on the streets; roads would be blocked because of drunk wedding guests in the baraat. The biggest thing is that after prohibition, drunken loitering has stopped, and domestic violence levels have come down. People who are addicted to alcohol may manage to procure it [liquor] but the open display of drunkenness and behaviour associated with it has come down because of the fear of arrest. Revenue loss has been compensated by the fact that there is some peace on the streets. Women especially have welcomed the move.

Will women again support the Nitish government over caste considerations, or is that phase over?

Women are still the biggest supporters of Nitish Kumar. The NDA government undertook 50% reservations for women in panchayats, empowered the rural woman from backward communities in a big way; they became mukhias (village heads) and sarpanches and it has radically impacted society in the countryside. When ticket distribution was being discussed, women zila parishad members came in large numbers asking for an Assembly ticket, a radical departure form the past when women candidates meant only from certain families.

Other moves like giving cycles to girl students, or 35% reservation in jobs has created a norm in society of encouraging education of girl child, and them entering professions like the police etc. Among women Nitish Kumar is the most recognised leader and women are a part of the entrenched support base of the Janata Dal (U).

Why was former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey denied a ticket and Manju Verma, tainted by the Muzzaffarnagar incident repeated?

The seat that Gupteshwar Pandey wanted was traditionally with the BJP. In every election, certain seats are coveted by both sides and others are claimed by a particular side. We thought we would get that particular seat in Buxar this time [but] we didn’t. So he was deprived of a ticket. As for Manju Verma, she was only given a ticket once the court cleared her.

36,2020/10/19,LJP will win more seats than JD(U) in Bihar polls: Chirag,"Launching a scathing attack on the Chief Minister, Lok Janshakti Party president said any vote to Mr. Kumar-headed JD(U) would “destroy” Bihar tomorrow.

Continuing with his tirade against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan on Monday claimed that his party will win more seats than JD(U) in the Bihar polls.

Launching a scathing attack on the Chief Minister, he said any vote to Kumar-headed JD(U) would “destroy” Bihar tomorrow.

Meanwhile, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav has criticised Mr. Kumar for not doing justice with Mr. Chirag.

“What Nitish Kumar Ji did with Chirag Paswan is not good. Chirag Paswan needs his father at this time more than ever before but Ram Vilas Paswan ji is not among us and we are sad about it. Nitish Kumar did injustice to Chirag Paswan,” Tejashwi tweeted.

“The LJP will win more seats than the JD(U) and will build a new and young Bihar with the pledge of #Bihar1stBihari1st, Mr. Chirag said in a tweet.

The regional party has announced the names of 95 candidates so far in two lists. Many deserters from BJP as well as JD(U) have taken taken shelter in the bungalow (election symbol of the LJP), and they have been fielded in the elections by the party.

Chirag Paswan once again claimed that a BJP-LJP government will be formed in Bihar after assembly poll results are declared on November 10, and advised saffron party leaders not to use terms like “vote katua” (splitter of votes) against his party “just to keep Mr. Kumar happy“.

“I am pained at the term vote katua being used against the LJP,” he told PTI-Bhasha.

“They should apply their own wisdom and not use such words just to make somebody happy,” he said, asserting BJP leaders are targeting his party at the behest of Mr. Kumar.

“I dont mind whatever BJP leaders say, because I know they are just putting words to the Chief Ministers thoughts, the 37-year-old son of the veteran Dalit leader said.

Urging more respect from the BJP towards his late father and former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, he said they should not use such term for a party built painstakingly by somebody who was their colleague in the government just until 11 days ago.

“Ultimately, a BJP-LJP government will be formed in the state after November 10,” he said, and added the BJP should not say things that may hamper possibilities of a future coming together of the two.

The LJP which has disassociated itself from the NDA in Bihar, has put candidates against JD(U) nominees in many places.

Mr. Chirag, who had initially said he would go all out against the JD(U) only, has pitted nearly half-a- dozen nominees against the BJP too. This included Raghopur seat where BJP’s Satish Kumar is taking on Grand Alliance Chief Ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav.

Separately, the LJP president posted a series of tweets in which he severely criticised Mr. Kumar and his work in the past five years.

“The bureaucracy has ruled the roost over the past five years. None of the (Nitish Kumars) seven resolves (saat nishchay) has been fulfilled,” he said, demanding the Chief Minister to give a detailed account of the work done in the past five years of his rule.

“The sahib has destroyed Biharis just for power.

Any vote given to the JD(U) will destroy Bihar tomorrow, Mr. Chirag said in one of his tweets.

Meanwhile, Mr. Chirag performed shraddha ritual of his father Monday in his native village Sahabanni in Khagaria district.

Accompanied by cousin Prince Raj, who is also LJP’s Bihar unit president, Mr. Chirag performed “pind daan” at Fultaura ghat on the banks of river Bagmati and hosted fellow villagers as part of the rituals.

He also paid a visit to house of Raj Kumari Devi, first wife of Ram Vilas Paswan, and took her blessings.

Mr. Chirag has said that a similar shraddha function will be held in Patna Tuesday for which he has already sent invitations to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home minister Amit Shah, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi, Rabri Devi and many others known to his father.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/r18fl4/article32892908.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHIRAGPASWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/ljp-will-win-more-seats-than-jdu-in-bihar-polls-chirag/article32892909.ece
37,2020/10/19,"Bihar Assembly polls | ‘Without money, nothing moves’ — it’s the refrain in Paliganj","Voters in Arwal and Sasaram also say that things get done solely by greasing the palms of officials, and prohibition remains only in name.

Despite an anti-incumbency wave and the possibility that the BJP may be eyeing the Bihar Chief Minister’s post, Janata Dal(U) leader and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is hoping to take on the mantle for the fourth consecutive term. But Mr. Kumar’s prospects are threatened by people’s anger and dissatisfaction with the issues of corruption and prohibition in the State.

In Paliganj, the residents are wary of approaching panchayats and police stations because of the bribe expected. Bansidhar Paswan works as a bicycle mechanic at the Paliganj bus stand. He told The Hindu, “Corruption at the block and panchayat levels and at local police stations is so rampant that people, especially those from the Extremely Backward Class (EBC) are badly affected. It is because of EBC support that Mr. Kumar has been in power for 15 years but in the last five years, corruption among officials has grown manifold and we’re hit hard.”

He alleged that the local police “don’t move a step” without bribe. “Paisa diye bina kuch bhi nahi hota hai. Pehle aisa nahi tha [Without giving money nothing moves. It was not like this earlier],” he said.

Also read: Bihar Assembly election | Voters appear divided in the State

Corruption appears to dominate all aspects around Bihar’s prohibition law too. A travel agent at the bus stand asked, “What prohibition? Daru [liquor] is available everywhere… even at local police stations. Either the policemen or the local goondas [ruffians] are profiting over prohibition. For common people, the cost has gone up two-three times.”

“Likh lijiye, darubandi bhi Nitish Kumar ko bhari padega election mein. BJP kyon nahi samajhti hai is baat ko? [Write it down, Nitish Kumar will have to pay a heavy price in this election because of prohibtion. Why doesn’t the BJP understand this?” he said.

It is a three-corner fight in Paliganj. Rebel BJP candidate Usha Vidyarthi is contesting on a Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) ticket. Ms. Vidyarthi is pitted against the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate Jaivardhan Yadav who, in 2015, won on a Rashtriya Janata Dal ticket but who has recently joined the JD(U), and Sandeep Bhaskar (CPI Marxist-Leninist) from the Opposition’s grand alliance.

A few kilometres away, at Prasadi-English village in Arwal district, sexagenarian farmer Shiv Nandan Sharma also expressed his frustration about corruption.

“Koi dekhane wala nahi hai, sirf bahashan baji karte hain Nitishjji... yeh kar diye, woh kar diye. Ghuskhori charam seema par hai, khas kar ke nichale level ke adhikariyon mein [No one is here to look after us. Nitish Kumar does only big talk… I’ve done this, done that. Bribery is at its peak everywhere, especially at the lower-level bureaucracy],” said Mr. Sharma, though he admitted he has been a supporter of the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

When asked about Mr. Modi putting his support behind Mr. Kumar, Mr. Sharma said, “Yes, but it will be better if the BJP has its own candidate as Chief Minister this time. Anyone can be a better Chief Minister than Nitish Kumar,” he said.

He responds with a hearty laugh when asked about prohibition. “You all know… it [liquor] is available everywhere. Visit our village market in the evening and see how effective Mr. Nitish Kumar’s prohibition is in villages,” he said.

Concerns around these issues echo among voters of Dedhgaon in the Dinara constituency of Sasaram district too. Retired Army jawan Harendra Kumar said, “I raise a challenge; if Mr. Kumar himself goes to a block office in disguise for any work to be done there and gets it done without paying any cut money to the officials or, if he can file an FIR without bribing policemen, I’ll go out in public with my face blackened.”

“The first term of Mr. Kumar was good. He was active and really wanted to do things for people living in villages but, nowadays he listens to only what his chamcha (sycophant) officials feed him,” he added.

38,2020/10/19,"‘NBA 2k21’ game review: We say, wait for 2k22","Unless you love microtransactions, there is not much reason to upgrade to NBA 2k21

The NBA 2k series has distinguished itself with its excellent MyCareer mode and solid on-court experience. NBA 2k20 was an excellent entry into the series that brought a lot to the table with enhanced graphics and better footwork and player spacing systems. NBA 2k21 improves on those a bit, but carries over a lot of the problems.

NBA 2k21 Developer: Visual Concepts

Visual Concepts Publisher: 2K Games, 2K Sports

2K Games, 2K Sports Price: ₹3,999 on Playstation 4, Xbox One and ₹2,999 on PC

The MyCareer mode carries over those movie-like high production values as seen in previous games. The Long Shadow is a story that focuses on Junior, a footballer-turned-basketballer trying hard to succeed and clamber out of his deceased father’s shadow. Look forward to some excellent performances by Djimon Hounsou (Black Panther), Michael K Williams (The Wire) and Jesse Williams (Detroid: Beyond Human). The story does its job propelling your custom character into the game on a journey into the NBA — though it is not as powerful as that of its predecessors, it still puts your character in the scheme of things.

The character models of players look and sound like their real-world counterparts, with courts looking gorgeous, excellent motion capture and realistic crowds... the MyCareer character models do look a bit rough on some of the main models though. Thankfully the gameplay is tight, with your AI players doing a great job of creating space for you. New in 2k21 is the Shot Stick feature, that allows you to shoot precise shots using the right thumbstick. Meant for advanced players, it takes a bit of time to learn and if you do master it, it could be a powerful tool, giving you an edge in your competitive play. While the game has gotten better, it still has got a few minor annoyances, especially in the AI and animation glitches.

NBA 2k21’s MyTeam mode is where the excitement is at: with an updated roster of players, you can set up your fantasy team and play matches in several competitive modes. You can play either solo with a team of AI players against the computer, or you can take your game online in multi-player, structured in seasons very much like the current slew of service games like Overwatch, Fortnite or Destiny. You grind away in matches, and upgrade your squad on your road to be the best. It is not easy to get to the top, unless you want to spend some real money on NBA 2k21.

Transaction denied

When it comes to cosmetics in which to deck out your players, it is understandable that they have micro-transactions (a business model where users can purchase virtual goods with micro-payments). However, NBA 2k21 is riddled with the worst kinds of monetisation behind terrible grinding, that rears its head even in MyCareer.

This is what you would expect in a free-to-play game (not one you have to pay full price), and even then a level of smart monetisation which Ubisoft, Blizzard and even Fortnite do well. The interface of 2k21 is bruising with stats and coins, taking every chance to shell out its wares to get you to splurge. There is a lot of content to discover in NBA 2k21 in terms of game modes and even the inclusion of the WNBA and MyLeague. There is also a hub area set in colourful Venice Beach, California, where you can visit stores and purchase costumes and more. With the game’s monetisation like an impatient waiter always hustling you for an order. A lot of content is good, but it is just a collection of video game modes thrown together in one hot mess.

Other than the Shot Stick feature, new roster and a decent MyCareer, there is nothing much here to justify that upgrade to 2k21, that you won’t get in previous games. If you are an NBA fan looking for the latest though, then this is great, otherwise wait for a more chunkier release next year... hopefully.

39,2020/10/19,Chennai-born Nonviolenze’s début album is an amalgam of music and art,"Better known as Nonviolenze, Chennai-born and Houston-based Shri Baratan’s début album ‘Ghosts Of War’ is a landmark of his professional and personal growth

The lockdown has been tough on the music community, but out of that has come a new breed of musicians who are finally breathing life into a long-dormant dream. Houston-based Shri Baratan, aka Nonviolenze, is one of them.

In 2012, Chennai-born Shri formed Nonviolenze, a creative studio conceptualised to “tie the music to a visual experience... tying the painting to the music, to the poetry,” and that is when he started putting out singles. But only in 2020 did he release his debut album, Ghosts Of War, which is about “politics, religious warfare, and how people have lost track of these issues, and should do their civic duties unconditionally”.

A dream come true

The album came together seamlessly, particularly over the “quiet time” of the pandemic, recalls Shri.

The album took a year and a half, starting in early 2019 and Shri finished all the technical recording in March, while mastering took three months. Owing to the pandemic, Shri had to undertake multiple roles, including recording; it was a “huge climb”, he admits. He is motivated by the fact that “people are always starving for good music.” He is quick to point out that Ghosts Of War is not just a musical experience but a multi-sensory one. Living in Texas, an arts and culture hotspot of the US, certainly catalyses this.

Shri, who moved from Chennai to the US in the early ‘90s as a software expert, says, “Over the years, I’ve written close to 80 songs, 100 if I include the instrumentals.” The solo album comprises nine melodies including ‘Queen’, ‘Tree’, ‘Matrix’, and ‘Ghosts Of War.’

When it came to being a producer-songwriter for Ghosts Of War, his power over the album’s journey was important as he has seen how a musician’s vision often gets diluted as it passes through different hands during development. “There’s nothing wrong with that,” he clarifies, “but when you have a different point of view from someone else, the music is not able to go exactly where you initially envisioned it to.” The multi-hyphenate shares he had Grammy-winning Jorge Santos to do the mastering for Ghosts Of War. The working relationship took its time to suit both their wavelengths and Shri is happy with the outcome, having learned a lot from Jorge.

Shri speaks about his rhythm style and harmonics as something unique from what he is sure many have heard over the years. “There’s a lot of harmonic work, and the combination of the electric guitar accents that come in with the acoustics was kind of different — I haven’t heard anything like that before.”

The 55-year-old has been nurturing his love for music since he was 15, and is proud of his achievements so far.

He says age should never hold someone back if their dream is the ultimate mission for happiness. He shares he has another album coming out in a couple of weeks. “You have to be patient with yourself, and you have to put a lot — time and dedication — into it.”

Ghosts Of War can be found on Spotify and YouTube.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/pi4yzd/article32892147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HIQ171511024,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/nonviolenze-chennai-born-shri-baratan-interview-ghosts-of-war/article32892152.ece

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), New Delhi, has dismissed an appeal filed by Ramesh Kymal, former chairman and managing director of Siemens Gamesa Renewable Power Pvt. Ltd. Earlier, the Chennai Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had rejected an insolvency petition filed by him against the company over alleged non-payment of settlement dues.

Mr. Kymal, who quit on April 30, 2020, had alleged in his petition that the company had not paid him dues of ₹104.11 crore.

The NCLT had rejected the plea citing the insertion of Section 10-A in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) through an ordinance that provided relief from insolvency proceedings on defaults that happened on or after March 25, 2020.

The NCLAT noted that the bar created was retrospective as the cut-off date had been fixed as March 25, 2020 and the newly inserted Section 10-A had come into effect on June 5, 2020.

It would be absurd to hold that the embargo would extend to an application in respect of such default after March 25, 2020, but before June 5, 2020, i.e. the commencement of the IBC (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, as the bar operates in respect of default arising on or after March 25, 2020 and not before such date, the appellate tribunal noted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/nclat-junks-kymals-plea-against-siemens-gamesa/article32895461.ece

Anuj Rustagi, COO – Chocolate, Coffee, Confectionery and New Category Development - Foods, ITC Ltd., said, “ We are shifting the entire Jelimals’ jelly bears range to Jelimals Immunoz and keeping consumer price points the same across the offerings. We hope this move will make a small but meaningful difference in protecting our kids in the present context.’’

The children’s confectionery category in the country, pegged at ₹1,000 crore, includes candies, toffees, eclairs, jellies and lollipops.

The immunity based confectionery products have witnessed significant growth during the pandemic. The space is driven by colours and interesting shapes which Jelly as a format is perfectly amenable to deliver. ITC’s Life Sciences & Technology Centre has been working on various health and nutrition areas for nearly a decade with immunity emerging as a key focus area, the company said.

As per a recent Jelimals commissioned study, conducted by InfoLeap Market Research & Consultancy LLC, to understand kids’ perspective on the new normal world, some 95% of kids said they missed ‘Meeting Friends’ in person and 94% missed ‘Going to school’, making immunity support an ‘uncompromising imperative’ in the new normal world. If given a ‘Superpower’ 74% children would utilise it to ‘Save People (56%) and Find Cure (18%)’ from COVID-19 with concern for parents and family (38%) being foremost for the children.

46,2020/10/19,Pan-India 5G network may cost up to ₹2.3 lakh cr.: report,"Investments needed in key components for a pan-India 5G network coverage, including spectrum, sites and fibre, is estimated to be ₹1.3-2.3 lakh crore, as per a report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

It added this amount should reduce to ₹78,800 crore-₹1.3 lakh crore for coverage of only Metros and A circles, with the capex requirement for 5G roll-out in Mumbai pegged at ₹10,000 crore, and for Delhi at ₹8,700 crore.

“The Indian telecom industry is seeing capex peak out (particularly for Bharti and RJio) and increased free cash flows. However, risks have started emerging due to the increased capex toward 5G technology upgrade and the upcoming spectrum renewal,” the report noted, adding that the spectrum which will be up for renewal in the next 6-12 months, would require an investment of ₹28,000 crore for Reliance Jio, ₹12,900 crore for Bharti Airtel and ₹8,300 crore for Vodafone Idea at reserve price.

Further, the report noted that with no new players, nascent use cases, limited incremental revenue potential, spectrum woes along with an inherently low ARPU structure in India, telcos may wait for the 5G technology to stabilise globally and see reduction in equipment cost, before deploying fresh technology, which could take 3-4 years.

“Undoubted, the quantum of investment is exorbitantly high given the stressed balance sheet of telcos and the low prevailing ARPUs. Therefore, we believe in the initial phase, telcos may selectively choose spectrum in a few circles and run 5G for select enterprise-driven Internet of Things (IoT) operations,” it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/pan-india-5g-network-may-cost-up-to-23-lakh-cr-report/article32894290.ece

“The facts clearly indicate the involvement and complicity of certain U.P. State Police and officials of the State government machinery in manipulation and destruction of evidence and shielding the accused in respect of the subject crime,” Mr. Kamble said in a writ petition, filed by advocate Vipin Nair.

The petition was reserved for orders on October 15 along with a separate one filed by Satyama Dubey. The Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde had voiced an inclination to have the Allahabad HC monitor the ongoing CBI probe.

In his petition, Mr. Kamble said, to start with, the “government hospital at Aligarh had not taken vaginal swabs and body smears of the victim or collected drop sheet after change of clothes, despite finding torn clothes and bleeding on under-garments”.

It said certain high-ranking police and government officials, even before the investigation was complete, had ruled out the possibility of rape, and made public statements to this extent.

This, the petition said, “indicates a clear nexus between the State Police and the accused”.

The plea said the “bizarre and barbaric manner in which the body of the victim was stealthily cremated in the dead of the night by police officials smacks of them being involved in suppressing the crime rather than investigating it”.

""This unpardonable crime by the State Police and other government instrumentality, which denied the family of the victim even the basic right to perform last rites on the body of the victim is nothing but depravity of the soul,” the petition said.

More than half of Indian farmers oppose the three farm reform laws passed by Parliament last month, while only 35% support them, according to a new survey in 16 States conducted by Gaon Connection Insights. Almost 40% expressed fear that the new laws will end state-run markets and government procurement at minimum support prices, and almost 60% are in favour of a legal guarantee for MSPs.

Despite the widespread opposition to these laws, almost 44% of respondents said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government was “pro-farmer,” while only 28% said it was “anti-farmer.” When asked about whom the Modi government supports, however, about 35% of those surveyed thought that it supports farmers, while 30% felt that it supports private companies and multinationals, and 15% said the government supports middlemen and traders.

Gaon Connection did a face-to-face survey of a sample of more than 5,000 farmers, three-fourths of whom own less than five acres of land, in 53 districts across 16 States between October 3 and 9. It found that state-run mandis are the most popular medium of produce sale across the country (36%), followed by private traders (26%). Currently, only 2% sell to corporates.

Geographically, the north-western States of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh which have the highest proportion of sales in state-run markets (78%), also have the highest rates of opposition to the news reform laws (77%).

The west was, however, the only region where supporters of the new laws (52%) narrowly overtook the opposition (48%). In the north, which includes the poll-bound State of Bihar, along with Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, there was a 53:47 ratio against the laws.

The All India Judges Association has passed a resolution condemning Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s letter against Supreme Court judge, Justice N.V. Ramana, as a “deliberate attempt to scandalise and coerce the judiciary”. The Association said the “tone, tenor and timing of the letter portrays malafide and appears to be orchestrated for hidden agendas”.

“The Executive Committee of All India Judges Association considers this act to be a deliberate attempt to scandalise and coerce the judiciary and legal fraternity.

The resolution also condemned “all such attacks on the judicial institution by vested interests, who are bent upon to destroy judicial dignity and the independence of the judiciary and try to intimidate judges for favourable orders”.

The letter and its release to the media has created a furore among the legal fraternity, with many similar resolutions passed by several Bar bodies objecting to Mr. Reddy’s actions as an affront to the judiciary.

Agricultural cooperatives will soon be able to access a ₹10,000-crore fund for the creation of health infrastructure.

With COVID-19 putting a spotlight on the shortage of health facilities in rural areas, the National Cooperative Development Corporation, an autonomous institution under the Agriculture Ministry, rolled out the Ayushman Sahakar scheme to extend term loans worth ₹10,000 crore to co-ops for the next five years.

“Our primary motivation is access to healthcare for farmers in rural areas. That driving spirit gets amplified because of COVID-19. The pandemic has re-emphasised the gaps in healthcare in the country,” NCDC Managing Director Sundeep Nayak told The Hindu.

Over the last three months, the spread of the pandemic has shifted from cities towards rural areas, potentially threatening the agriculture sector which has been the one bright spot in the economy so far. At the end of June, 80% of the districts with more than 1,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were urban, while only 20% were rural. By the end of September, the ratio had morphed. Of districts with over 1,000 cases, 53% are now rural, according to data analysed by CRISIL Research.

The pandemic has brought into focus the requirement of creation of more facilities, said Union Minister of State for Agriculture Parshottam Rupala at the launch. Expressing the hope that Ayushman Sahakar would revolutionise the way healthcare delivery takes place in rural areas, he also urged the cooperatives to take up healthcare services as an activity for farmers.

There are already 52 hospitals being run by cooperatives across the country, with a cumulative bed strength of more than 5,000, said Mr. Nayak. The NCDC’s loans can be used to set up primary health centres but could also support medical education, diagnostic services, pharmaceutical businesses, blood banks, telemedicine or even wellness centres. Both allopathic and AYUSH-related projects can apply.

“There is a huge need for medical and nursing education in rural areas. But the problem is a lack of infrastructure. Co-ops find it difficult to access credit for such projects as banks may not give them loans for non-agricultural purposes,” said Mr. Nayak, adding that employment generation in rural areas is one of the secondary benefits of the scheme.

Apart from working capital and margin money to meet operational requirements, the scheme will also provide interest subvention of 1% to women majority cooperatives.

The NCDC disbursed over ₹28,000 crore of loans to cooperatives last year. It does not get any budgetary support or grants from the government and raises all its money from the market.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ttbdk5/article32893506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-SUNDEEPNAYAK-SA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/10000-cr-scheme-for-agri-coops-to-set-up-health-infra-in-rural-areas/article32893507.ece
58,2020/10/19,Modi government destroyed economy and infected maximum number of people: Rahul,"Ex-Congress chief puts out a chart comparing how other countries handled the two issues

Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Monday put out a chart on Twitter comparing how other countries handled the COVID-19 and the economy to argue that the Narendra Modi government “destroyed the economy and infected the maximum number of people”.

Also read: Indian democracy passing through its ‘most difficult phase’: Sonia Gandhi

The data — sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Worldometer, a well known reference website — compared the GDP growth for 2020 and the number of COVID-19 deaths per million of a country’s population.

Among 11 Asian nations including China, the table showed India was at the bottom with a projected 10.3% contraction in the GDP and 83 deaths per million.

The chart showed India’s neighbours like Bangladesh, Nepal, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka on a higher ranking.

“How to completely destroy an economy and infect the maximum number of people really quickly,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted.

The Congress leader acknowledged what was first used by Professor Kaushik Basu, who now teaches at the Cornell University.

Mr. Basu, who served as Chief Economic Advisor during the Manmohan Singh government, tweeted: “Even a few years ago, none could have imagined India’s economy being where it is”.

“Lessons: Don’t be in data denial. Mistakes happen — admit & take corrective action. Use the talent & expertise available in the country,” he said,adding that only a part of the economic slowdown has been caused by the pandemic.

On Sunday, Congress president Sonia Gandhi too had targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his government’s handling of the pandemic and the economy.

“There is neither a plan nor strategic thinking, solution or way ahead in the fight against corona...Never has the country witnessed such a free-fall in GDP as also all other economic indices,” Ms. Gandhi said at a virtual meeting with her party leaders.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/i74idg/article32868230.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI05-10-2020000059BTHNAK-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-government-destroyed-economy-and-infected-maximum-number-of-people-rahul/article32893304.ece
59,2020/10/19,"India’s lockdown may have hit livelihoods, but saved lakhs of lives: N.K. Singh","Going forward, there is a need for a National Commission on Migration, says the Fifteenth Finance Commission chairperson

History will judge India’s leadership favourably for the swift lockdown imposed in March to curb COVID-19 as it saved lakhs of lives even though livelihoods suffered, Fifteenth Finance Commission chairperson N.K. Singh has said. In his autobiography Portraits of Power released on Monday, Mr. Singh, who once served as secretary to then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, gives readers a vivid overview of his brushes with the machinations of India’s political economy through the course of crucial economic reforms. Edited excerpts from an interview with The Hindu

In your book, you blame migrants’ woes after the lockdown partly on poor conduct from employers and corporate India, as well as State governments. Wouldn’t it have helped to have a little longer notice than a few hours for the lockdown?

I think the lockdown had to be taken with such alacrity and decisiveness that it did. And I think history will judge the leadership favourably, because our lockdown with 85% severity was the most effective lockdown. When people analyse retrospectively why our first quarter GDP was negative 23.9%, they will also consider the severity of our lockdown which was more than many other countries with much less severe and draconian lockdowns. So it may not have been that it saved livelihoods, but it certainly saved lakhs of lives, enabled authorities to prepare for ramping up health infrastructure to deal with the pandemic. Did corporate India fail migrants? Perhaps. Did urban India fail rural India? Perhaps. Did the employers fail their employees? Yes, by all means. Did some of the State governments not act with the necessary alacrity? Maybe. But the fact remains there were heart-rending scenes of migrants returning home. We hope that these will never be repeated.

Going forward, there is a need for a National Commission on Migration (NCM) — credible data remains elusive as also the definition of who is a genuine migrant. I was a member of the last U.N. Commission on Migration and we studied patterns all over. One of the patterns we saw was circular migration. Brain drain was a big concern for societies with fewer people with skills. As those people went away, the societies suffered. We also came across circular migration — Kerala has too many people from Bihar and U.P. and locals say they are altering the ethos of the State. I asked them — where are your labourers gone? There was uncomfortable silence as they had gone in search of better jobs maybe to the Middle East. So, someone needed to take up the jobs they left behind. Everyone is a gainer then, as the remittances helped the incomes of their families and the State domestic product. The kind of economic activity needed in the State continued because of labour from other States. Of course, there will be inevitable tension as happened during the pandemic when some of them went back home. The whole issue of migration needs attention, most importantly, from a cohesive national entity which goes into it. Some of it is currently handled by Labour Ministry, some by urban development… An NCM, in my view, would be an important initiative for the government to consider. The problems of migration may have abated for now, but remain a challenge.

In your book, you recall an episode where you conveyed a message to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh from Larry Summers, questioning the rationale of the retrospective taxation amendments moved by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee in the 2012-13 Budget. Now, the government is considering an appeal against Vodafone’s victory over that tax in international arbitration proceedings. What do you feel is the way forward?

The context is significant. I happened to be in Mexico for an international conference during their G20 presidency and an interactive session with Tony Blair and Larry Summers. He asked me for a favour. “For a long time, you guys in India have said the country believes in the rule of law. I don’t think you believe in it… could you carry a message to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, that considering what you have done on retrospective taxation, this doesn’t measure up very well with India’s persistent assertion to investors that India believes in the rule of law.” So I did convey this to the PM, but Dr. Manmohan Singh being Dr. Manmohan Singh – an absolute conformist, in terms of rules, procedures, propriety and self-effacing characteristics — he asked me in return. “NK, you have also worked in the Finance Ministry for long. When a Finance Minister comes to you once, and you suggest to him that something should be rethought of, he goes and rethinks and comes back holding on to his view, do you think it is proper for any Prime Minister to interfere in the decision which must be left to the Finance Minister.” This is what he told me and the taxation law was implemented.

The current state of play is the case is in judicial process. This has revenue and other implications… I do not know if this is the only instance of retrospective taxation. More important than the case is the principle of retrospective taxation itself. When this issue had come up in Parliament too, I remember vividly that the Finance Minister had asked if the Parliament is sovereign and competent enough to enact laws and change them retrospectively. Of course, the answer is yes. Parliament is the final repository of all decisions and that’s how this Bill was passed at the time. I had a further opportunity to discuss this in the Public Accounts Committee, which had set up a group under my chairmanship to look at taxation issues. I had summoned the Finance Secretary to share the notings and considerations in the matter. After some adjournments, he did tell me that it looks as though legal opinion had been taken and Parliament was quite competent to make this change. The issue was not Parliamentary competence, but the rationale for making this far-reaching amendment.

That was history. On the future path, it’s up to the government to decide it. It is not merely about this particular case and its resolution, but the broader principle and framework which should govern retrospective taxation.

You have shared another anecdote about Dr. Singh asking you why Biharis do well outside the State, but Bihar itself remains poor. With the Bihar elections coming up, how do you view the development agenda for the State?

In the last book I edited with London School of Economics’ Nicholas Stern, Towards a New Bihar, we had all argued that the historical issue of Bihar has been the dynamic and the balance between identity politics and development politics. Society has remained far too long as a stratified social order, it is only development that can make that order more malleable. Therefore, it would be the quest and hope of every Bihari, that whatever the outcome of the forthcoming election, development should trump identity politics. I cannot wish away the fact that identity politics, in terms of class, caste and other fragmentation, exists. I very much hope that development will prevail because till that happens, society will remain stratified and horizontal, vertical mobility remains restricted.

One of the malaise of the State’s economy has been that private investment remains shy. Land is a very big issue due to the high man to land ratio. I don’t believe in the dominant philosophy there of enhancing public outlay in the belief that private capital will ride on the back of that. This view needs to be significantly modified… It is only synergy between public outlay and private capital that can guarantee long-term growth. Whatever government comes to power, I hope they can get more private investment into Bihar. It is also ironical that the 1991 economic reforms that were supposed to bring all-round benefits, the benefits of getting private capital into states that needed development, have been weak for the poorest of States. Bihar is perhaps at the rock bottom of per capita income compared to other progressive States like Haryana.

When Dr. Manmohan Singh asked me: “How is it that Biharis when they go outside the State, achieve spectacular success in every walk of life, but Bihar remains poor”. Then he laughed and said, “India can never prosper till Bihar prospers”. It was an ironic remark that was quite embedded in my mind. Later, for a particular period, Bihar’s growth was significantly higher than India’s growth rate. I told him then: “Now, Sir, India cannot prosper till it grows as fast as Bihar has been growing for the last three years.” He laughed. The message was not lost on him or me. I hope the new government of Bihar will continue to focus on important development initiates to bridge the gap between where Bihar is and where it must be. That’s the only way to boost Bihar’s per capita income. Look at the migratory patterns. Maximum outward migration is from Bihar and parts of U.P. These are also driven by factors like better opportunities. The State’s migratory issues need an analysis both on social and economic factors.

Is the Commission expected to have more meetings before submitting its report (expected this month)?

We will be having several meetings before submitting the report. Each word would have to be weighed carefully. This award will be from April 1, 2021 to April 1, 2026. So we have to be careful that the judgements we exercise in projecting figures on GDP, tax buoyancy are embedded in appropriate rationale.

Given the pressures on the fiscal front, is it a good time to revisit your 2018 recommendation while reviewing the fiscal responsibility framework, to set up a Fiscal Commission?

This is a problem that is strictly in the domain of the Finance Commission and we would be submitting our recommendations quite shortly. The Commission is yet to make its formal recommendations. The NDA was the first to have a Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act in 2003 under the Vajpayee government. It took another NDA government under PM Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to set up a committee to review the fiscal law (chaired by Dr. Singh). I think that made two important departures — it gave a new path of fiscal deficit targets over the medium term, and introduced public debt as an important anchor towards the realisation of which fiscal deficit targets must be calibrated. Yes, looking at India’s per capita income and it’s a lower middle-income country, it was felt that debt to GDP of 60% over the medium term would keep us far away from any concerns of debt cliffs and it became the law in 2018. The question is what happens now?

Definitely, considering the expenditure pressures and the pandemic still has huge uncertainties, it would be sensible to suggest that this is a period of fiscal forbearance and not fiscal rectitude. Going ahead, the problem is I have to create a framework for the next five years and one big difference between 2018 and now, is that the FRBM Committee was primarily designed to look at the debt and fiscal target of the Centre. As far as the investing community is concerned, they are keen on the general government debt, the Centre and the States combined.

We are closely looking at the kind of flexibility and leeway that should be given to both the Union and the States. As a Finance Commission, one of our overriding priorities is that the Union and the States must be treated in an equal way. We have ensured that in our recommendations. I think a sensible course would be to introduce some flexibility both on the debt trajectory and the fiscal deficit both for the Centre and the States, ensuring that the new fiscal compact represents the partnership between the Union and States for the future.

Some say the fiscal compact between the Union and the States is already in trouble over the GST compensation tussle…

The last word on this important issue has not been said. Both the States and the Centre are recalibrating the contours of a consensus within the GST Council. It is for the Council to take such decisions. There are two-three things that are very evident, though. The Compensation Cess Act really ensures that the 14% revenue growth to States for five years was covered and any inability of the State to get that is to be met by the Compensation cess fund. With accruals to the cess fund not adequate to meet the shortfall, the issue is how are they to be met? Clearly, they cannot be met from the Consolidated Fund of India and it would be inappropriate. So it has to be raised through some borrowing arrangement like the present one. The only issue is the sequence of the borrowing. To Some extent, it doesn’t make much of a difference. What investors see is the debt of the general government, not the differentiated debt between the Centre and the States. So to some extent, this entire thing would be a shuffling of accounts. And I see there is now some forward movement. I have no doubt in my mind that the Union government would make sure that the period for which the cess is extended would be adequate enough to extinguish the liabilities which arise up to July 2022. This means that the cess may have to be continued up to a much later period, I think maybe in 2025-26. Any Finance Commission would calibrate that the revenues the State would receive would include the unpaid liabilities arising on account of the shortfall in GST. I think very frankly, there are a lot of misgivings about the fiscal compact having been broken, there is a trust deficit…. These may be somewhat exaggerated. First of all, there was no resiling or backtracking from the Central government on the obligations and liabilities themselves. At no point has the Centre said it will not pay for those five years. It’s only a question of how it can be adjusted in the most efficient way to undertake the borrowings.

So the Commission will be factoring these into its calculations?

It would be reasonable and rational for the FC to assume that since there is no suggestion whatsoever of any resiling of the obligations undertaken by the Central government, that these revenues (due) up to 2022 would not be extinguished but carried forward. And for the period of our award, we would naturally fully reckon and take this into account.

You have spent some time on the need to ramp up the health spending given the pandemic?

This has rightly been taken as a challenge but also an opportunity to carry out reforms from the unfinished agenda. You can argue if they are good enough. But there has been an attempt to bite the bullet on power, agriculture, health, education, Medical Council of India… a whole lot of reforms have been fast-forwarded from the background. Secondly, the inadequacy of the health infrastructure and the fact that historically, a very insignificant part of public outlay has gone to health sector. Not only in terms of the absolute amount of outlay — which is just about 1% of which States are doing 0.65%. States will have to do much more to take it to 0.8% as per the new National Health Policy of 2017. Finance Minister had said that the Central government’s outlay would also have to be increased. So raising the public outlay is one area. The second is the skewed nature of the outlay — the poorest of States have the poorest of infrastructure for understandable reasons. If you look at the overall divide across India, even at the lower end, the availability of beds, doctors and paramedics — is heavily distorted. So how do we repair this deficiency quickly because the pandemic has not really run its course. Thirdly, how do we get the panchayats to get quality primary health centres and district hospitals. Health expenditure needs to be assigned higher priority.

We have devoted a dedicated chapter to health in the Commission report, which goes into the question of how to reprioritise existing resources available more effectively to the third tier. And additional resources for which we will consider a sector-based initiative for health.

You have mentioned the need for a healthy financial system for long-term growth and alluded to the question of autonomy in banks and whether public sector banks have served their role?

There can be no two opinions — no large economy like India can really sustain a high-growth trajectory without a well-functioning financial system in terms of costs, quality and availability of efficient financial intermediation. It raises the broader issue of whether the nationalisation of banks done by Indira Gandhi has fulfilled its role. From a miniscule penetration in rural areas, which has certainly changed. Yet, access to credit remained rather weak till the PM’s initiatives on Jan Dhan accounts and DBT made banking more inclusive. Are these enough? Can there be a well-functioning autonomous banking system without revisiting the ownership structure? There is an ongoing public debate. Several measures have been taken by this government to improve banks’ autonomy. But the broader issue is the twin balance sheet problem — impaired balance sheets of banks, non-banking financial companies and corporates… what kind of ownership structure of the banks will serve the needs of a large economy’s growth? The timing of these changes should be carefully thought through. This is not the time to revisit the broader issue of ownership, with the pandemic to cope with. But yes, over time, it has to be considered if the banking nationalisation has served its utility.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/687n39/article32893084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lockdown-enabled-authorities-to-ramp-up-healthcare-to-deal-with-pandemic-says-nk-singh/article32893085.ece

Dhirendra Pratap Singh allegedly shot dead Jai Prakash Pal Gama (46) on Thursday following a quarrel over the allotment of ration shops at Durjanpur village in Ballia’s Reoti area. Senior administration and police officials were present at the meeting when the incident took place.

After evading arrest for days, Dhirendra Pratap was arrested by the U.P. Special Task Force from Lucknow on October 18. A cash reward of ₹50,000 had been announced for his arrest.

During interrogation, Dhirendra Pratap told the police that he opened fire in self-defence, according to officials.

“DIG Azamgarh range Subhash Chandra Dubey interrogated Dhirendra Pratap Singh for nearly an hour, and he gave the details of the incident. He assured the police that he would help in the recovery of the weapon (used in the crime), and said that he had fired in self-defence,” said SHO of Kotwali police station Vipin Singh.

He told police that around 2,000 people had gathered in the village on Thursday and there was a fracas over the allotment of ration shops, the SHO said.

The accused claimed that the other side started the quarrel and opened fire, injuring his nephew and five-six women of his family. His nephew later succumbed to his injuries, he added.

Dhirendra Pratap also blamed the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and the circle officer for the incident, the police said.

He alleged that the SDM colluded with the other side.

He claimed that initially the SDM had announced that the allotment of shops will be done on the basis of majority. But later he said only those having identity cards could take part in voting, according to the police.

The Uttar Pradesh government has already suspended the SDM, the circle officer and other policemen present at the spot.

Besides Dhirendra Pratap, four others — Santosh Yadav, Amarjeet Yadav, Ajay Singh and Dharmendra Singh — were arrested in connection with the case from Ballia on October 18.

Meanwhile, BJP MLA from the State’s Bairia Assembly constituency Surendra Singh came out in support of Dhirendra Pratap.

He said he will try to meet Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and present his side of the story.

He also said he will seek an impartial probe into the incident by the CB-CID.

The Bairia MLA said while the person who fired bullets has been arrested, action should also be taken against those who wielded sticks and pelted stones.

“A case should also be registered from the other side [Dhirendra Pratap Singh]. Action should be taken against both sides as per their role,” he said.

On Sunday, BJP workers held a meeting in Bairia over the incident, with one of them demanding a CBI probe in the case. They alleged that the police are working in a biased manner.

The BJP workers threatened to resign from the party if a case from Dhirendra Pratap’s side is not registered within two days.

So far, police have arrested 10 people in the case, in which an FIR has been lodged against around 30 people, most of whom are yet to be identified.

The Uttar Pradesh Police had on October 17 said it would invoke the stringent National Security Act (NSA) and the Gangsters Act against the accused.

Under the NSA, one can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if authorities are satisfied that the person is a threat to national security or law and order.

62,2020/10/19,Australia to join Malabar naval exercise next month,"2020 naval exercise consists of India, Japan and U.S.

Amid the ongoing stand-off with China in eastern Ladakh, the Ministry of Defence on Monday announced that Australia would join the Malabar 2020 naval exercise, consisting of India, Japan and the U.S., to be held next month, more than three years after Australia first requested to join.

“As India seeks to increase cooperation with other countries in the maritime security domain and in the light of increased defence cooperation with Australia, Malabar 2020 will see the participation of the Australian Navy,” the Ministry said in a statement.

The exercise is scheduled to be held end November and the planning conference to finalise the modalities of the exercise is scheduled to be held virtually end of October, according to an official source.

This will formally bring together the militaries of the four countries in the Quad group.

Australia reaction

In Canberra, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said that following an invitation from India, Australia would participate in Exercise Malabar 2020. “It will bolster the ability of India, Australia, Japan and the United States to work together to uphold peace and stability across our region,” she said.

Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said, “High-end military exercises like Malabar are key to enhancing Australia’s maritime capabilities, building interoperability with our close partners, and demonstrating our collective resolve to support an open and prosperous Indo-Pacific”. It showcased the “deep trust” between four major Indo-Pacific democracies and their “shared will” to work together on common security interests, she noted.

In 2018, the exercise was conducted off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea, off the coast the Japan in 2019 and was expected to be held in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea this year. This year, the exercise had been planned on a ‘non-contact - at sea’ format, the statement said.

The participants of Exercise Malabar 2020 were engaging to enhance safety and security in the maritime domain, the Ministry said. “They collectively support free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific and remain committed to a rules based international order.”

In August, a key meeting in the Defence Ministry discussed the issue of inviting Australia and an understanding was reached but no final decision was taken.

Quad meet in Tokyo

The issue of Australia’s inclusion in Malabar had come up for discussion at the Quad foreign ministers meet in Tokyo early this month.

As reported by The Hindu on June 3, after years of reluctance due to Beijing’s sensitivities, India said it was open to Australia’s inclusion in Malabar, which began as a bilateral exercise between India and the U.S. in 1992 and was expanded into a trilateral format with the inclusion of Japan in 2015.

Canberra joined the exercise once in 2007 and it drew a sharp response from Beijing. In 2017, Australia requested for observer status in the exercise. While New Delhi was reluctant to accept Canberra’s request, the bilateral cooperation has gone up significantly since.

The exercise too has grown in scope and complexity over the years further boosted by India signing three of the four foundational agreements with the U.S. and increasing defence procurements from the U.S., enabling interoperability. Japan and the U.S. have been pressing India for Australia’s inclusion in Malabar.

With India and Japan signing a military logistics agreement in September, New Delhi now has such agreements with the other Quad nations. India had signed maritime information sharing agreements for Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) with Australia and Japan and a similar agreement is under discussion with the U.S.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yonpyn/article32892276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MALABAR2017KB-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/australia-to-join-malabar-naval-exercise-next-month/article32892277.ece

The Central government permitted the opening of cinema halls from October 15, but none of the theatres opened on Thursday, waiting for a word from the State government.

V. Mega Talkies (Triveni) manager Surendra Kumar says abiding by the COVID-19 norms after reopening will not be a big challenge as most of the theatres used to run at 20% occupancy on an average for most days except for the first three days of release - Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

On Thursday and Friday, the theatre owners began the exercise of getting the halls cleaned and keeping the premises ready for movie releases, and some companies even offered concessional rates on weekly charges to be paid, but the movie shows did not resume.

In Anantapur district, 76 cinema halls were fully functional before the lockdown, but each of them has huge amounts due towards electricity bills since April, running into lakhs of rupees for those who have High Tension (HT) connections. The triple screen Triveni- Taringini- Tejaswini, the biggest multiplex in Anantapur, too has a huge bill pending, according to Mr. Kumar.

Smaller non-AC theatres are in the Commercial (LT) category, for whom the minimum charges are lower.

While the State cine exhibitors’ association has represented to the Chief Minister seeking a waiver of power bills or concession for the pandemic period, a decision was not taken till October 15 night.

80,2020/10/19,"East Godavari, A.P.’s major source of virus cases, set to reopen schools","COVID test made mandatory for all teachers

Over 90% of the 18,000 teachers serving the government schools in East Godavari district have undergone the COVID-19 test preparing themselves to take classes once the academic year resumes on November 2.

East Godavari Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy has made it mandatory that every teacher should undergo the COVID-19 test to be allowed to duties, apart from implementation of the SOP (Standing Operating Procedure) like sanitisation, use of mask and physical distancing.

District Education Officer S. Abraham said that 90% of the 18,000 teachers of the government schools in the district have already undergone the COVID-19 test and the rest of them will take the same by November 2.

Private schools

In the case of private schools, guidelines are being prepared to ensure that every teacher should undergo the COVID-19 test. Nearly 10,000 teachers are in service in the private schools in the district.

“By November 2, we will ensure that all the teachers are screened for the COVID-19 both in government and private schools. The district administration cannot afford to reopen the schools without teachers being tested for the COVID-19 to prevent further spread of the disease from the teacher to students,” said Mr. Abraham.

The district authorities are yet to decide whether the schools would be reopened with half of the student strength or with limited classes per day.

""Formally, we have geared up to reopen the schools from November 2 and the a detailed plan on how to run the school is yet to be received from the higher authorities,” said Mr. Abraham.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/36ee0n/article32889655.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/east-godavari-aps-major-source-of-virus-cases-set-to-reopen-schools/article32888468.ece

84,2020/10/19,Veligonda project work reaches fag end,"‘The first tunnel covering 18.8 km may be completed by November-end’

The works of the long-pending Pula Subbaiah Veligonda project has reached the fag end of its completion and going by the pace of works, farmers can expect the project to fructify in a few months.

The project, planned during the tenure of former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy under the Jalayagnam scheme in undivided Andhra Pradesh, envisages to draw 43.50 tmcft of flood water of the Krishna river from the foreshore of Srisailam Project Reservoir through Kollam Vagu, upstream of Srisailam Reservoir, by gravity through two tunnels and thereafter, to impound in Nallamala Sagar Reservoir through a feeder canal.

The ₹6,500-crore project has missed several deadlines, suffering cost and time overruns for many reasons including technical snag faced while drilling the two gigantic tunnels without blasting so as not to disturb the natural environment of the Nagarjunasagar Srisailam tiger reserve. “Only 280 metres of drilling work is still left. The first tunnel with seven metre diameter covering a distance of 18.8 km is all set for completion by the November end.

Dismantling of the tunnel boring machine(TBM) from inside, a laborious process, may take another month,” Superintending Engineer (constructions) N. Nagesh told The Hindu, after taking stock of the progress of works.

The head regulator work at Kollam Vagu which is designed to draw water from the foreshore of Srisailam reservoir has been hit owing to recurring flood situation in the Krishna river this year. The heavy inflows into the Srisailam reservoir made it difficult to move men and material and complete the works swiftly, he explains.

Trial run

The Nallamala Sagar reservoir has already been completed by closing the Sunkesula, Gottipadia and Kakarla gaps. Construction of the first tunnel has also been completed up to a distance of 18.54 km so far.

The first stage of the project envisages to draw 10.7 tmcft water from Srisailam reservoir during floods and ensure irrigation water to 1.19 lakh acres of farm lands and drinking water to around 4 lakh people.

The government is keen on commencing the trial run of the release of the Krishna water to Nallamala Sagar in January and step it up after overcoming the teething problems during the kharif season, says official sources.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/1qbi94/article32888547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19ONG4VELIGONDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/veligonda-project-work-reaches-fag-end/article32888548.ece

88,2020/10/19,Foundation stone laid for aircraft museum in Kakinada,"Decommissioned TU-142 M aircraft to be installed by early 2021

Agriculture Minister Kurasala Kannababu and Kakinada MP Vanga Geetha on Sunday laid the foundation stone for the aircraft museum being developed by the Godavari Urban Development Authority (GUDA), exhibiting the decommissioned Indian Navy’s aircraft, TU-142 M, at the Kakinada beach park in East Godavari district.

The Andhra Pradesh State Tourism Department was interested in developing the aircraft museum and obtained permission from the Indian Navy to shift the TU-142 M craft from INS Rajali Naval Air Station in Tamil Nadu State to Kakinada city by 2020. However, the museum project has been delayed owing to the COVID-19 lockdown.

The turboprop aircraft eqipped with four engines was decommissioned at INS Rajali Naval Air Station in March 2017 following 29 years of service in the Indian Navy. The aircraft’s key features were its top speed of 925 kmph and a combat range of 6,500 km, according to an official release issued by GUDA.

The State government has already engaged a technical crew from Visakhapatnam and Tamil Nadu for refurbishment and installation of the aircraft at the museum on the Kakinada beach.

“The aircraft museum project will add beauty to the Kakinada beach and becomes a symbol of inspiration for the youth to know more about the defence services. Inculcating an interest in the youth for the armed forces is the prime motto behind developing the museum,” Mr. Kannababu told reporters.

The museum is expected to be inaugurated early next year, allowing visitors to view all technical details and features of the aircraft. GUDA vice-chairman R. Amarendra Kumar and other officials were present.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pqzr5l/article32888482.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19-VZ-AIRCRAFTMUSEUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/foundation-stone-laid-for-aircraft-museum-in-kakinada/article32888483.ece

93,2020/10/19,Footfalls rising in Godavari,"Forest Dept., however, is yet to open it facilities

The Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) has already opened its resorts in the East and West Godavari districts with all the precautionary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the facilities.

""Everyone in a resort, including the staff, is advised to wear a face mask apart from practising the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) mandated by the government to keep the coronavirus at bay and prevent any disruption to tourism activities,"" says APTDC divisional manager (Godavari districts) Thota Veeranarayana.

""The major resorts and accommodation facilities for tourists are available at Dindi, Rajamahendravaram and Dwaraka Tirumala, where footfalls are rising,"" he adds.

For boating operations, the tourism authorities are being extra careful and are allowing only a limited number of people on board.

Forest resorts

The Forest Department is waiting for the nod for the reopening of its resorts. ""The ground has been prepared to reopen the resorts in the Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary, Maredumilli and other places in the East Godavari agency with due precautions. Thermal screening at the entrance of the tourism spots will be made mandatory for everyone,"" says C. Selvam, Divisional Forest Officer (Wildlife Division-Eluru).

We will not operate boating services anywhere in the tourism destinations under the department for some time,"" he adds.

94,2020/10/19,Lack of new films a big dampener,"Cinemas are allowed to open, but reruns may not enthuse viewers

Exhibition of films may continue to be at an arm’s length for entertainment seekers in the near future. Though the government is ready to open up cinemas by duly following the COVID-19 protocols, the industry is unlikely to welcome the idea. The exhibitors have more reasons to cite on staying away from the latest ‘Unlock’ option, rather than embrace it with open arms.

First of all, the marathon lockdown since March-end has wreaked havoc on the film industry, which is still trying to grapple with the reality. With permission for shooting remaining elusive for over four months, many films have remained mere scripts. In the absence of content, films are not in a position to hit the box office, which is said to be the first disappointing factor for the exhibitors. Even if the theatres are to remain open, there will be severe crunch for fresh content and as such re-run may be the only option staring at their face.

Thanks to the presence of globalised audience today, ‘world wide release’ is not just an option, but is a mandatory requirement for the tinsel town to rake in the moolah. ""If there has to be a release, it should only be a worldwide release to ensure decent profit. The James Bond film ‘No time to die’ slated for April 2020 had to be postponed to April 2021 to ensure global release. Similarly, another big budget movie ‘Fast and Furious 9’ is expected to release by May next. Our Telugu films will be released only when the U.S., Europe and the Middle East are also ready to show the same,"" says film distributor and exhibitor N.V. Prasad, who was the last president of the undivided Andhra Pradesh Film Chamber of Commerce. The foreign release will ensure a whopping revenue of ₹50 crore, he points out.

‘Power’ hassles

The exhibitors have already appealed to the government for some relief from the exorbitant power bills levied on the theatres even during the lockdown period. ""We are awaiting a positive response in this regard. Our fraternity can focus on future only if we get some relief from this back-breaking burden,"" explains Mr. Prasad.

Though a sizeable chunk of viewers is cosying up in their drawing rooms to watch films on the OTT platforms, the industry sees no major threat. ""For most Indians, walking out of the house and getting into a theatre is the most sought-after experience and OTT is no match,"" another theatre owner chips in.

The exhibitors expect the under-production films to be ready for release by January next year, coinciding with Sankranti.

On the third day of the Navaratri Brahmotsavams currently under way at the temple of Lord Venkateswara, rituals relating to ‘simha vahanam’ were observed inside the hill temple on Sunday.

Special rituals were conducted to the processional deity of Lord Malayappa who was dressed in the attires of Abhaya Ahwana Narasimha Swamy and mounted atop the golden ‘simha vahanam’ the embodiment of courage and valour. The festivities were held at the Kalyanotsava mandapam inside the temple.

TTD Executive Officer K.S. Jawahar Reddy inspected the Matrusri Tarigonda Vengamamba Annaprasadam edifice and exhorted the staff to improve the quality of the food served to pilgrims and at the same time maintain the hygiene of surroundings at the monolithic structure.

Accompanied by Additional EO A.V. Dharma Reddy, he also inspected the cold storage, dining hall, kitchen and had his luncheon at the complex along with other devotees.

Later, he also visited the Vaikuntham complex, the entry points of darshan lines and reviewed the procedure for depositing of mobiles, footwear, supply of beverages and health clinics.

The festivities inside the temple drew to a close with ‘Muthyapu pandiri vahanam’ in the night.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qkpuqz/article32888229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19VJSIMAHAVAHAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lord-rides-simha-vahanam/article32888230.ece
96,2020/10/19,Tourist buzz is missing this festive season,"Vizag, despite its many attractions, has seen lukewarm response so far

The AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) hotels and resorts in Visakhapatnam district that resumed operations after a prolonged lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have been able to register barely 35% occupancy on an average. Similar is the case with private hotels too. Under normal circumstances, the facilities are fully booked two to three months ahead of the Dasara vacation.

“The patronage is picking up slowly but lack of regular trains and limited flights has made a huge dent in tourist arrivals, particularly Bengali tourists, who come in large groups during Dasara. We do not see much improvement this season but hope to attract more tourists by December-end,” Tourism divisional manager T.G. Prasad Reddy tells The Hindu.

“Only business visitors who have no escape from travel are coming but they too are preferring to go back as soon as possible, local sight-seeing is no longer on their priority list,” says Muralikrishna, a tour operator in the city.

Government word awaited

Movie theatres, on the other hand, did not reopen even after being permitted to screen films from October 15. The exhibitors in the State, at a meeting in Vijayawada, resolved not to reopen cinemas till the State government gives a firm assurance on relaxing power tariff and certain other concessions in view of the pandemic situation, which allows them to utilise only 50% of the seats. However, later a few theatres have opened.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tuxxs9/article32888494.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/228290723col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tourist-buzz-is-missing-this-festive-season/article32888222.ece
97,2020/10/19,Tourism sector on a bumpy road to recovery in A.P.,"Tourism sector, among the worst-hit by the pandemic, is still struggling to make a comeback, while cinemas are yet to see a silver lining

The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has overturned the fundamental slogans of ‘Service with Human Touch’ and ‘Service with a Smile’ on which the tourism and hospitality sector thrives. Touch is not a preferred practice any more and the very few faint smiles left around get hidden behind the mask.

People watched helplessly as the rapid spread of the virus ravaged economy quickly and changed their lives forever. Those associated with this sector say that to survive this crisis, revive their business and thrive again in the industry is the biggest challenge ever.

""All tourist destinations in the State have reopened this month but where are the people?"" asks S. Prasanth, president of the Hotels and Restaurants Association of Andhra Pradesh (HRAAP).

Most hotels opened in July or August but there has been very less or no business. ""We tried talking to our corporate clientele but they said unless the COVID-19 vaccine comes out, nobody is ready to take risk,"" rues Mr. Prasanth.

The pandemic has forced around 20% of the hotels in the State to permanently shut down while another 10% have downed the shutters with a hope to reopen in the next financial year.

The public response to the unlock process is very slow, he says. ""It’s over three months that the hotel industry has started operating but we have reached only 25% business today. People still feel unsafe,"" he says, expressing the hope that from April, things may start looking up.

The association members approached the government seeking help to revive their businesses and are hopeful of a positive news very soon.

Boating activity suffers

Even as the government struggles to find ways for revival of the tourism properties, operators of the aligned activities wait with a bated breath for normalcy to return. Adventure sports and boating activity are major attractions of the AP Tourism. The Bhavani Island, a prized possession of the tourism wing, wears a deserted look in the absence of boating facility, suspended for now on account of the floods in the Krishna river.

All boating activity was suspended in September last year in the wake of a private tourist boat capsize at Kutchulur that claimed many lives prompting the authorities to take a long, hard look at the rules that govern private boat operators.

Amidst murmurs of ‘a very high’ security deposit and rigid terms and conditions for private investors, boats were set sailing in the Krishna and the Godavari rivers after a long gap, only to be anchored again due to torrential rains causing a flood.

""The year 2020 has been a disaster. We are waiting for the new tourism policy for clarity to emerge,"" said Tarun Kakani, co-convenor of the tourism panel of the Confederation of Indian Industry-AP chapter and CEO of the Amaravati Boating Club.

Sunil Nair, a travel and tour operator from Vijayawada, narrates his woes on account of the pandemic. ""I have a client base here and I cannot shut the shop and disappear from the scene. Though there is no business I keep my office open in the hope that things will get better. But I can’t afford to do this any longer,"" he laments.

Ray of hope

The Tours and Travels Association of Andhra (TTAA) State president K. Vijaya Mohan, in a media interaction, had said that the tourism sector had suffered a loss of business of nearly ₹2,000 crore by the end of August.

Managing Director of the AP Tourism Development Corporation and CEO of AP Tourism Authority Pravin Kumar agrees that the COVID-19 has given very hard times, but he also sees a ray of hope. ""I can see the revival happening, although it is slow. Post lockdown, we started with less than 10% business in the 37 properties of the APTDC in the State but it has gone up to almost 35% now. Other activities like water-based adventure sports will also resume soon when the flood water recedes,"" he says and adds: ""Today I may be struggling to pay salaries to my employees but I can see things slowly brightening up.""",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gdg28c/article32889743.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ALL1South01AGCM78DSVL2jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/on-bumpy-road-to-recovery/article32888215.ece

The government has issued orders making the Andhra Pradesh Energy Conservation Building Code (APECBC) mandatory for obtaining approvals for commercial and non-residential buildings with a plot area of 1,000 square metres, or built-up area of 2,000 square metres.

The Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MAUD) Department has issued a G.O. making amendments to the A.P. Building Rules-2017, which makes the APECBC compliance mandatory for commercial buildings.

Union Ministry of Power-led Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) introduced the ECBC in commercial and non-residential buildings to ensure construction of energy efficient buildings with reduced electrical energy by 30-40%, an official release said.

The MAUD Department had already integrated the ECBC compliance into the online Development Permission Management System for building approvals.

With the APECBC, all the commercial buildings, other non-residential buildings that had a plot area of more than 1,000 square metres, or built-up area of 2,000 square metres and multiplexes, hospitals, hotels, and convention centres, irrespective of their built-up area, had to comply with the APECBC.

100,2020/10/19,SBI employee arrested on fraud charge,"He allegedly stole gold from the bank to raise a loan of ₹1.05 crore

A cash in-charge of the State Bank of India’s branch at Samanasa under the Amalapuram rural police station limits in East Godavari district was arrested on Sunday on the charge of stealing gold from the bank to raise a loan of ₹1.05 crore against it.

The accused, Bulusu Veera Venkata Satya Subramanya Sarma, allegedly resorted to the fraud between February 2019 and September 2020.

Modus operandi

Addressing the media, Amalapuram DSP Masoon Basha said. “The accused created 25 gold loan accounts in the name of his family members, relatives and a few employees of the bank branch. The modus operandi is to steal gold from the lockers at the time of settlement of gold loans to genuine customers, and raise the loan against the stolen gold.”

“The accused resorted to the fraud to clear his personal debt of ₹55 lakh, which he had reportedly lost in agriculture in the recent years,” he said, and added that the accused was arrested at one of his aqua ponds under the IPC Sections 420, 409, 465, 471 and 477 (A),” Mr. Basha said.

The police swung into action based on a written complaint lodged against the accused by SBI Regional Manager (Amalapuram region) on September 29. The fraud had come to light during the bank’s internal inquiry in August, and the accused was suspended on September 14.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sbi-employee-arrested-on-fraud-charge/article32888121.ece

102,2020/10/19,"Minister directs officials to provide clean food, water at relief centres","In light of a possible outbreak of communicable diseases in the flood-affected districts of North Karnataka, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar on Monday directed officials to initiate steps to provide quality food and clean and safe drinking water to those housed in relief centres.

“If safe drinking water is not available, it should be boiled and filtered before being provided to people. The government has provided a menu chart and guidelines have been laid down to maintain cleanliness at the care centres,” he said, after holding a review meeting of Deputy Commissioners, District Health Officers, and zilla panchayat CEOs of Bagalkot, Vijayapura, Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Koppal, and Belagavi districts through videoconferencing.

The government has directed the authorities to shift senior citizens, pregnant women, and children to community health centres, and for the provision of masks, sanitisers, and other facilities, besides ensuring that social distancing norm are followed.

Saying that the spread of communicable diseases such as dengue and chikungunya in these districts was under control when compared to last year, the Minister said that the next few months would be crucial. “We have instructed officials to make use of mobile health units, if necessary,” he said, adding that the chances of spread of infections were more during the winter and festive seasons. He said that Kerala, which had effectively contained the spread of the virus, saw a spurt after Onam. “The same mistake should not be repeated in Karnataka,” he said.

On pvt. hospitals

Dr. Sudhakar said that if any private hospital is found using agents or asking patients to wait to get a bed or overcharging for beds, people can complain to the State government and the registration of the hospital would be cancelled.

He also acknowledged that there were complaints that many private hospitals were falsely terming people as positive for COVID-19, while many people were also giving out wrong phone numbers and addresses when they get tested for COVID-19.

Dr. Sudhakar said there has been a 73% increase in testing this month in Bengaluru, which is greater than the percentage in cities such as Chennai, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, and Delhi. He added that the positivity rate and the death rate were decreasing in the State because of early testing. Till September 19, as many as 13 lakh tests were done in Bengaluru alone, but within a month, by October 18, around 22 lakh tests were conducted in the city, he said.

On vaccine

Dr. Sudhakar has appealed to citizens to take care of their health for another three months and exercise all precautionary measures, as the hope is that a COVID-19 vaccine will be out in January.

He also said that he would have a meeting with experts to see how the distribution of vaccine should take place in the State. “It will be an elaborate exercise and we will plan how the distribution of vaccine can be done across the State. First, senior citizens and those with co-morbidities will get vaccinated,” the Minister said.

He also advocated that people take measures such as steam inhalation with mint or tulsi leaves, Unani medicine Arque-Ajeeb, and drinking turmeric milk. These measures were suggested by an AYUSH expert who was present at the press conference. However, many doctors have pointed out that there is no evidence that measures such as steaming will help people keep COVID-19 at bay.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/minister-directs-officials-to-provide-clean-food-water-at-relief-centres/article32895953.ece
103,2020/10/19,"Reforms in medical education will ensure more seats, says Modi","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the reforms in medical education would ensure more medical seats for students in the country.

Delivering the centenary convocation address of the University of Mysore virtually, Mr. Modi said the BJP government at the Centre, which had “ensured transparency and vision in medical education” by setting up the National Medical Commission, was bringing in two new laws to usher in reforms in homoeopathy and other Indian medicine studies. These reforms will ensure that youngsters will have more medical education seats, he said.

Mr. Modi also said that ever since his government came to power in the country in 2014, several premier engineering and medical education institutes have been opened.

For about six decades, there were only seven All-India Institutes of Medical Sciences in the country. But after 2014, their numbers more than doubled with 15 AIIMS being either established or in the process of starting.

Similarly, he said there were 16 Indian Institutes of Technology in the country prior to 2014. But during the last six years, one new IIT has been opened every year, including one in Karnataka’s Dharwad, Mr. Modi claimed. During the last five years, a total of 16 Indian Institutes of Information Technology have been added to the nine that existed prior to 2014. Also, the number of Indian Institutes of Management has increased by seven during the last five or six years, in addition to the 13 that existed previously.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/reforms-in-medical-education-will-ensure-more-seats-says-modi/article32895947.ece
104,2020/10/19,PM Modi calls upon youth be adapt to changing nature of jobs,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday called upon youngsters to be flexible and adaptable to the changing nature of jobs. Delivering the centenary convocation address of the University of Mysore (UoM) virtually, he emphasised the importance of “skilling, reskilling and upskilling” in the modern-day world and how the National Education Policy (NEP) unveiled by his government recently paid attention to this aspect.

The NEP, Mr. Modi said, ensures a multi-dimensional approach towards education and will bring about fundamental changes in the field of education and make youngsters more competitive.

He called upon the student community to strive for excellence based on their individual strength and ability, but advised them against restricting themselves to fitting into a box. “Probably, the box in which you are trying to fit yourself into may not have been made for you,” he said.

“Take time out for yourself, introspect, understand your strengths... This will help you choose your future path,” he said. He sought to draw the attention of students to the startups floated by youngsters during COVID-19 times and said startups were the strength of the country. “Your progress is also the country’s progress. If you become self-reliant, so will the country.”

Saying that it was heartening to note the University of Mysore’s plans to start multi-disciplinary programmes as envisaged under the NEP, the Prime Minister said students can simultaneously study “global technology” and “local culture” under these programmes.

He said it was incumbent upon UoM, one of the top educational institutions, to innovate. The university should start more incubation and technology development centres, besides ensuring industry-academy linkage while focusing more on inter-disciplinary research, he said.

Earlier, UoM Vice-Chancellor G. Hemanth Kumar welcomed Mr. Modi from Crawford Hall in Mysuru, where the centenary convocation was organised amid COVID-19 restrictions.

105,2020/10/19,Channapatna and Kinnal toy makers in a bind over BIS certification rule,"In under three months, toy makers in Channapatna and Kinnal, like many other traditional toy makers in the country, should register themselves for Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) certification and their products should carry the BIS mark. But on the ground, most artisans are not aware of the new rules. And those who do know it say the process is expensive for the kind of business they are involved in.

In an effort to make toys safe, the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry had notified the Toys (Quality Control) Order, 2020, making it compulsory for toy makers to secure BIS certification. The use of BIS Standard Mark as per the BIS (Conformity Assessment) Regulations, 2018 is compulsory. The manufacturer has to seek a separate licence for each toy he produces, and the licence is issued after testing. While the earlier deadline to conform to the new norms was September 1, 2020, the Union government extended it by four months.

While the awareness among manufacturers of the GI-registered Channapatna toys, which is a cottage industry, is poor, many artisans to whom The Hindu spoke to were ignorant of the new rule and expressed an inability to undergo the certification process because of the costs involved. Besides Channapatna toys, artisans at Kinnal village in Koppal also make traditional toys that are protected under GI.

“Nobody has so far told us about the certification and we are not aware of it. Our toy making is a small-scale industry. We are already in debt because of the lockdown and slowdown in the market. Where will we get the money for certification?” asked artisan Samiullah, of Zoya Handicrafts. “In fact, when we take our products to the showroom, we have to beg for payment, which will be a few hundred rupees.” In fact, the government should get us certification for the industry to survive, Mr. Samiullah added.

Old-timers recall how the number of artisans, which was upwards of 20,000 just over two decades ago, has now dwindled to less than 1,000. “If certification becomes mandatory, most may move out of the craft. We have not reported good business for nearly a year,” another artisan said.

On Monday, urging the Centre to withdraw the order in order to protect traditional toy makers, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who also represents Channapatna Assembly constituency, tweeted, “To get the BIS certification, artisans have to spend thousands of rupees. This order will hit the traditional toy-making industry. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appreciated the Channapatna toys in his Mann Ki Baat, these decisions will only help big industries.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rqt6n1/article32895928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BGTOYS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/channapatna-and-kinal-toy-makers-in-a-bind-over-bis-certification-rule/article32895929.ece
106,2020/10/19,"Initial estimates put flood losses at ₹3,000 crore in Karnataka","The initial estimates have put the losses due to heavy rain and floods in the northern region at ₹3,000 crore, according to Revenue Minister R. Ashok.

Speaking to presspersons at Sambra airport in Belagavi, the Minister said that because of the floods and downpour, about 8,000 people had been displaced and they were being sheltered at relief centres. So far, 10 persons have been killed, he said. He said that both COVID-19 and the sudden floods had posed a big challenge for the State government, but also expressed confidence that the government would successfully pull the State out of the crisis.

The Minister said that following reports about discrimination against displaced people at relief centres based on their caste, he had directed officials to treat everyone equally and provide them masks, sanitisers and soap in the wake of the pandemic. Standards have also been fixed for ensuring quality food at the relief centres, and officials violating the order will face disciplinary action, he said.

The Revenue Minister added that officials have been directed to expedite the process of relief disbursement in districts affected badly by floods and downpour. He clarified that there was no dearth of funds for flood relief.

Regarding allegations of misuse of COVID-19 relief funds by the Raibag tahsildar, Mr. Ashok said that any such act would amount to “cheating god”. “I will ask the Deputy Commissioner to suspend any such official,” he said.

‘Don’t have booth agents’

Taking a dig at the Congress, Mr. Ashok said the party was unable to find booth agents for the byelection to Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituency. “In R.R. Nagar, although the KPCC president has been leading the campaign, the party is not able to find booth agents. The Congress will end in third place in the R.R. Nagar bypoll. In Sira, we are building the party afresh. But there too we will win by a big margin,” he said.

Regarding the filing of a case against the Congress candidate in R.R. Nagar, the Minister said that once elections are announced, the administration is controlled by the Election Commission of India and the government does not have any control. “The filing of any poll-related case will be done by the Election Commission. The Congress party seems to lack basic general knowledge. Or is it the Congress culture to break the law?” he asked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ndl3l9/article32895886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BGFLOODSTATEPAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/initial-estimates-put-flood-losses-at-3000-crore-in-karnataka/article32895887.ece

109,2020/10/19,"After turning fodder producer, Mysuru zoo attains self-sufficiency","It has stopped procuring Napier grass from suppliers since October 1 after it started harvesting grass in bulk from a wasteland at its rescue centre

The COVID-19 crisis-hit Mysuru zoo has found a new way of cost-cutting and attaining self–sufficiency in meeting the forage needs for its captive herbivores since its revenue has dropped substantially.

Most zoos largely rely on gate collections for their maintenance and they had been closed till June due to lockdown. In spite of reopening, they are yet to get back the pre-COVID-19 era footfall and revenue, forcing them to look for cost-cutting exercises.

The Mysuru zoo, which was financially backing smaller zoos, was yet to recover from the blow that came with the pandemic. The footfall continues to be unenthusiastic though it has improved marginally in recent weeks. From 8,000-10,000 visitors a day to 1200-1500 visitors a day, the city’s most popular tourist attraction is starved of visitors, and the revenue loss could impact its projects.

In this grim situation, the zoo management came up with an idea of saving on forage crops that were procured for feeding the herbivores.

From October 1, the zoo has stopped procuring the forage crops, especially Napier grass from outside, as it has attained self-sufficiency in its production. With this, it can save at least ₹25 lakh a year.

Zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni told The Hindu that the zoo has started cultivating these crops at Koorgalli where it runs the animal rescue centre. The unused landscape, a wasteland, in the area was being used exclusively to cultivate the crops since the pandemic outbreak.

“We are today harvesting 1,300-1,500 kg a day, saving a lot of money. Forage crops worth ₹60,000 were procured daily from suppliers. This has been stopped now.”

The conical-shaped wasteland measuring nine acres is situated below the high-tension transmission line at the Chamundi Animal Rescue Centre.

With one sowing, the grass can be harvested for two years. From 300-400 kg of grass a day, the harvest has gone above 1,000 kg a day, Mr. Kulkarni added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/after-turning-fodder-producer-mysuru-zoo-attains-self-sufficiency/article32895691.ece

116,2020/10/19,MP tells ZP CEO to act against waste dumping on ring road,"At Central schemes’ review meeting, Pratap Simha calls for modernising sewage treatment plants also

Indiscriminate dumping of solid wastes along the Outer Ring Road (ORR) here has come under focus yet again. Innumerable public complaints have been made of garbage and building debris dumped in large amounts on this stretch, causing pollution and unhealthy conditions in residential layouts.

Mysuru MP Pratap Simha raised the issue at the meeting he chaired here on Monday for reviewing Central schemes.

He told Mysuru ZP CEO D. Bharati to act sternly against waste dumping and immediately identify land where the solid wastes from non-MCC areas or the areas beyond the ORR can be processed. The MP also asked the officials from the Mysuru City Corporation to call for tenders to clear the legacy wastes from the Vidyaranyapuram plant.

In the 15th finance plan, the Mysuru City Corporation has got ₹69 crore. As per the Centre’s regulations, funds should be used for solid waste management and improvement of drinking water distribution. Instead of allocating the grants to the wards, the MCC should also look at making use of the funds for modernising the sewage treatment plants at Kesare, Vidyaranyapuram and Rayanakere, the MP suggested.

Mr. Simha said the Centre was releasing ₹160 crore for the re-asphalting and repair works on the Outer Ring Road.

The MP asked District Health Officer Amarnath, who assumed charge on Monday, to crackdown on the fake doctors whose numbers had gone up after the COVID-19 outbreak.

The DHO was told to visit private hospitals and examine whether they were complying with the government guidelines on COVID-19 testing and treatment following complaints of overcharging.

117,2020/10/19,Mobile booths set up for doorstep COVID-19 testing,"As Mysuru sees an influx of visitors amidst Dasara festivities, MCC wants to carry out more testing for free

Even as the authorities here seem to have managed to salvage the lost grip on handling the COVID-19 pandemic, more testing is on the cards, taking it to the doorstep of people in a bid to flatten the curve.

After Bengaluru, Mysuru had been categorised as a hotspot for reporting alarmingly high cases and fatalities. This called for ramping up testing which is being done now.

Mobile COVID-19 testing booths had been constituted and these booths went to the doorsteps of those wishing to get the tests done. The sample collection and testing was done for free, and the people need not have to leave their places.

The number of cases reported on Sunday was 404 and the number of discharges was 353. Only one death was reported on Sunday. These statistics are in stark contrast to the figures early this month since the cases and fatalities had unusually peaked forcing the authorities to intervene and take corrective steps.

Doubling up the tests for early detection of infection and containing the spread in the community were prioritised increasing the number of testing and sample collection centres.

As on Sunday, 2.49 lakh samples had been tested in Mysuru district. Out of this, 45,042 samples had tested positive with nearly 36,823 discharges. The number of active cases stands at 7,296 as on Sunday.

The Mysuru City Corporation on Monday announced to carry out free mass testing in factories, industries, government and non-government institutions, schools and colleges and in other places in its bid to tighten the grip further on the spread.

MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde urged the public to make use of the facility. The MCC was carrying out testing at 22 places across the city which was in addition to the testing being carried out by the Department of Health and Family Welfare.

With the Dasara festivities on and the influx of tourists up, this measure is significant.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday called upon the youth to be flexible and adaptable to the changing nature of jobs.

Delivering the University of Mysore’s Centenary Convocation address virtually, Mr Modi emphasised in the importance of “skilling, re-skilling and upskilling” in the present day world and the National Education Policy (NEP) unveiled by his Government recently has paid attention to this aspect.

The NEP, Mr Modi said, ensures a multi-dimensional approach towards education and will bring about fundamental changes in the field of education and make the youth more competitive.

Expressing happiness over the University of Mysore’s plans to start multi-disciplinary programmes as envisaged under NEP, the Prime Minister said students can simultaneously study “global technology” and “local culture” under these programmes. This, he felt, can be used to promote local businesses through global technology.

He said it was incumbent upon the University of Mysore, which was one of the best educational institutions in India, to innovate. Hence, the University should start more incubation centres and technology development centres, besides ensuring industry-academy linkage while focussing more on inter-disciplinary research.

Local culture

Along with contemporary and global issues, the Prime Minister said the University is also expected to encourage local culture, local art and promote its tradition on research on social issues.

Calling upon the student community to strive for excellence based on their individual strength and ability, Mr. Modi said there was no need for them to restrict themselves so that they “fit into the box”. “Probably, the box in which you are trying to fit yourself, may not have been made for you”, he remarked.

“Take time out for yourself, introspect, understand your strength…..This will help you choose your future path”, he said before adding that India is a land of opportunities.

Start-ups

Mr Modi referred to the start-ups opened by the youth during COVID-19 pandemic and said these start-ups were the strength of the country. “Your progress is also the country’s progress. If you become atmanirbhar (self-reliant), the country will also become atmanirbhar”, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/m1ltsb/article32890790.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODIKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/narendra-modi-calls-for-youth-make-themselves-adaptable-to-changing-nature-of-jobs/article32890791.ece

The Navaratri celebrations at Sigandur Chowdeshwari Temple have begun with untoward incidents, following differences between the trustees and the principal priest of the temple.

Video clips showing Subrahmanya Bhat, the younger brother of principal priest Sheshagiri Bhat, assaulting a person from the opposite camp led by S. Ramappa, the head of the trust, have gone viral across the State.

Chowdeshwari Temple situated at Sigandur, on the backwaters of Sharavati, in Sagar taluk, is being managed by the family headed by Ramappa. Sheshagiri Bhat and his team look after daily pooja and special homas on the temple premises.

In recent years, the temple has attracted devotees from different areas leading to increase in the revenue.

The differences between the two factions came to the fore after the government relaxed the lockdown to allow opening of religious places. A dispute over sharing the revenue is said to be the reason for the controversy. Ramappa and his followers allegedly took over the premises belonging to the priest so that he couldn’t conduct special poojas. There were instances of heated arguments between two camps. Residents of area were also divided on the issue. There have been protests supporting each camp. Many organizations have urged the State government to take over the temple. Former Minister Kagodu Thimmappa also issued a statement supporting the demand for bringing the temple under Muzrai Department.

Following the incident of assault on Friday, Deputy Commissioner K.B. Shivakumar and other senior officers visited the temple on Saturday. The DC spoke to both Ramappa and Sheshagiri Bhat.

The DC told reporters he has instructed the Assistant Commissioner of Sagar subdivision to file a report on the financial transactions of the temple within a week. The status report would be sent to the State government.

When The Hindu reached Sheshagiri Bhat’s place to seek his reaction, his family members said he had gone to a hospital as he had a fever. A person close to the principal priest, on the condition of anonymity, said Ramappa was not allowing the priest to perform Chandi Homa as part of Navarathri. “The trust is not allowing us to perform homas that we have been doing for years. Only family members are in the trust. We want there to be a trust involving local people, not one family,” he said.

However, members of the trust do not support this demand. Ravi Sigandur, one of the trustees and son of Ramappa, told The Hindu that the trust could not include others. “It is a deity of our family. With many people in the trust, we cannot take quick decisions and address urgent needs. However, there can be a coordination committee, which can advice us,” he said.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has expressed disappointment over the incidents at the temple. “Such incidents shouldn’t have happened in the name of deity,” he told presspersons at Shikaripur on Sunday. On the demand for Muzrai Temple taking over the temple, the CM said he would discuss the issue with Deputy Commissioner of Shivamogga and others.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5fm9o8/article32888684.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGTEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/differences-between-trustees-head-priest-lead-to-assault-at-sigandur-temple/article32888685.ece

125,2020/10/19,AYUSH Ministry regulation irks teachers and colleges alike,"AYUSH Ministry’s move to regulate private Ayurveda colleges by weeding out “ghost” teachers who teach in more than one college has irked college managements and teachers who have migrated to States other than their own.

Teachers say that the pan-India order has caused a lot of inconvenience as the government has begun to collect data unrelated to their employment. College managements say this order could stop them from hiring the best talent from across the country.

“We are being harassed by the Ministry, that is collecting irrelevant information about us, like the number of milk packets we have purchased in a week or the receipts of fees paid for children’s education,’’ said a teacher.

The colleges have been been given the onus of proving that their teachers have been resident in the city where they teach. This is to ensure that no private college teacher employs “ghost” teachers whose names remain on the rolls in colleges where they don’t actually work.

To build this data base, the colleges are supposed to collect some details.

They include proof of purchase of any consumables in the city where the teacher is working.

At least one receipt for each month of employment for items such as grocery, medicine, restaurant or other bills, online purchase of any goods delivered to the teacher’s address located in the city, any transaction paid to a government authority from the teacher’s address in the city such as electricity bill, water bill, property tax, proof of bank account statement showing regular credit of salary from employer for one year, proof of regular travel from the teacher’s residence to the college for the lockdown period and earlier, proof of the last travel made by the teacher to his native place immediately before or after the lockdown.

Proof of employment , business, residence of spouse or parents in the same city or nearby city, proof of school admission of the teacher’s son or daughter in the same city or nearby city where the teacher is working, proof of rent payment or rent agreement and PAN of house owner if the rent is high, TDS certificate issued by the employer and ESI and EPF registration details of the teacher.

Teachers say this betrays the government’s lack of trust. “We want the government to believe us. We are not criminals to remain under the suspicious eye of the government all the time,’’ said Shivakumar Hiremath, who teaches in a private Ayurveda college in Belagavi district. “We have sent a request to the Prime Minister’s Office, seeking the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the issue and to help us out,’’ he said.

College managements say the order amounts to violation of the fundamental rights of teachers to find employment anywhere in the country. “One of the columns of the data sheet we have been provided asks us to get details of employment of the teacher’s husband or wife or parents who work in the same city or a nearby city. What does the government want to use such information for - to restrict teachers from leaving their native town? This is not acceptable,’’ said the chairman of a private Ayurveda college. “The former Member of Parliament said office-bearers of the Association of Private Ayurvedic Homoeopathic Medical Colleges met AYUSH secretary Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha and other senior officers to express our reservations. If the government restricts our recruitment policies, it will be taking away our right to employ the best teachers from different States,’’ he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ayush-ministry-regulation-irks-teachers-and-colleges-alike/article32888454.ece
126,2020/10/19,Congress seeks transfer of R.R. Nagar police inspector after filing of FIR,"A delegation of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) leaders on Sunday submitted a petition to the Election Commission (EC) seeking the transfer and suspension of police inspector Naveen of Rajarajeshwarinagar police station in the city for his alleged “prejudiced, biased, illegal and high-handed action” against the party’s candidate Kusuma H. and party workers. He had registered an FIR against them over alleged violations of the model code of conduct during the filing of nomination papers.

KPCC working president Saleem Ahmed and former MP V.S. Ugrappa submitted the petition to the Chief Electoral Officer here. They called for the posting of a “law-abiding officer” for ensuring free and fair bypolls on November 3.

In the interest of conducting free and fair elections, the Congress also urged the EC to direct the authorities concerned to register a criminal case against BJP candidate Munirathna and other leaders who had violated the provision of law while filing nomination papers on October 14.

The Congress claimed that the inspector, acting at the behest of the BJP candidate, had obtained a complaint from assistant sub-inspector Nagaraju of the same police station and registered the FIR against Ms. Kusuma and two others as accused for offences punishable under Sections 34, 188, and 353 of the Indian Penal Code.

The Congress said Ms. Kusuma has been booked after Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah’s escorts allegedly broke through security barricades set up 100 metres around the BBMP office and pushed the policemen on duty in a bid to make way for the leader to accompany the candidate while she filed her nomination papers. “This apart, Naveen has also been threatening INC workers of fixing them in criminal cases,” the petition claimed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-seeks-transfer-of-rr-nagar-police-inspector-after-filing-of-fir/article32888007.ece
127,2020/10/19,"Bhima waters inundate 10,000 houses in Kalaburagi district","River Bhima, which had been wreaking havoc along its course downstream at Afzalpur, Jewargi, Chittapur, Shahabad, and Kalaburagi taluks in Kalaburagi district for the past five days, continued to devastate on Sunday.

According to information provided by the district administration, the average discharge of water from Sonna Barrage remained at 8 lakh cusecs. Reports reaching the district headquarters late in the evening indicated a continuation of the destruction of standing crops and inundation of thousands of houses in over 157 villages. As per the district administration’s estimation, around 10,000 houses were flooded till Sunday evening. According to a media bulletin released by the district administration, 20,024 people from 57 flood-prone villages have been shifted to safer places. As many as 140 relief centres were operating as on Sunday evening. No loss of human life has been reported.

As per the Central Water Commission (CWC), the water level in Bhima measured at Deongaon bridge, situated close to the Sonna Barrage, for the first time since 2006 breached the danger level (404.5 metres) and highest flood level (407.34 metres) late on Friday. It hit 409 metres at 9 a.m. on Sunday. The water level is expected to cross 410 metres in the immediate future.

A company of Indian Army that arrived from Secunderabad late on Saturday joined teams of the National Disaster Response Force, State Disaster Response Force, fire personnel and local police in their rescue and relief operations. The 98-personnel company was divided into three teams and deployed in the flood-hit Afzalpur, Jewargi, and Shahabad taluks.

128,2020/10/19,COVID-19 infection rate high in Bengaluru Rural,"According to data from the COVID-19 war room, 97.3% of Karnataka’s 7,35,371 patients till October 14 were asymptomatic

Over seven days ending on October 15, although Bidar conducted the highest number of tests on asymptomatic cases and Bagalkot conducted the highest number of tests on symptomatic cases, the positivity rate among both asymptomatic and symptomatic persons was highest in Bengaluru Rural.

According to the State COVID-19 war room data till October 15, Bagalkot had tested 30.3% symptomatic patients and Bidar had tested 99.9% asymptomatic patients. Overall, 97.3% of the State’s 7,35,371 patients till October 14 were asymptomatic.

However, the Test Positivity Rate (TPR) among asymptomatic patients tested over the seven-day period was highest in Bengaluru Rural (17.2%). While Kopal had the least at 2.9%, the TPR among asymptomatic patients tested in Bengaluru Urban was 10.2%. Vijayapura, Mysuru, Hassan, Chitradurga, Udupi, Tumakuru, and Dakshina Kannada all had a TPR above 10.7%.

Bidar, with the highest number of asymptomatic persons tested, had the lowest TPR among asymptomatic patients at 1.6%. At 48.6%, Bengaluru Rural had the highest TPR among symptomatic cases.

Munish Moudgil, who heads the State COVID-19 war room, said this was simply because the rate of infection was higher in Bengaluru Rural. “A high positivity rate indicates a higher infection in that district,” he said.

False negatives?

K.V. Rama Mohan, member of Project: Jeevan Raksha, an initiative of Proxima, said the low TPR (11.7%) in Bagalkot, which has done the highest number of tests of symptomatic cases, points to the possibility of a prevalence of high false negatives in the region.

“Bagalkot has the highest percentage of symptomatic cases. Under normal circumstances, the TPR of symptomatic cases could be high. But the war room data indicates a lower TPR here. This scenario is possible if the prevalence of false negatives is higher in the region,” he said.

“The local administration should immediately examine whether the Indian Council of Medical Research protocol for negative testing of symptomatic cases is strictly followed in the district. In case it is not followed strictly, the chances are of positive patients wrongly testing negative and continuing to spread the virus,” he said.

Most contacts

According to the war room data, while Bidar, at 24.6, had the highest number of contacts — both primary and secondary put together — per patient in the seven-day period, Ballari (5.5) had the lowest.

Bengaluru had the highest percentage of nil contacts per positive patient. Of the 28,208 patients who tested positive during the period, 13,486 had no contacts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wi86ls/article32887982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGCOVIDSTATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/infection-rate-high-among-symptomatic-and-asymptomatic-patients-in-bengaluru-rural/article32887983.ece
129,2020/10/19,CM targets Opposition for COVID surge post Onam,"Pinarayi Vijayan blames the parties for organising violent Statewide agitations

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has once again blamed the Opposition parties for putting the State and its COVID-19 containment activities in jeopardy through the irresponsible manner in which violent Statewide agitations were organised in the State post-Onam festivities.

He said it was not true that the relaxations given by the government during Onam festivities was what had led to the surge in disease transmission in the State. Addressing the media here on Monday, Mr. Vijayan alleged that the State was now suffering the consequences of the total let-down in vigil and the deliberate acts of throwing all caution to the winds and organising mass congregations that violated all COVID-related physical distancing protocols in place in the State.

Prior to Onam itself, the government and the Health department had issued several guidelines and strictures on how Onam celebrations should not violate COVID-19 protocols and that people had to avoid congregations.

He said the public were also vigilant and had cooperated to a large extent with the regulations. The police were very vigilant during the Onam season, as is evidenced by the number of cases registered for violation of COVID-19 protocols during that time.

However, when the entire health system machinery, aided by the police and the public, were trying in unison to put up a joint front against COVID-19, it was the blatant manner in which “some people” had deliberately violated the protocols and let down the vigil that had led the State to the current epidemic situation, Mr. Vijayan alleged.

“At a crucial stage of disease containment, the actions by very responsible persons gave the wrong message to the public that it was okay to let down the guard and that COVID-19 was not a big deal. That was the turning point in the State’s fight against the pandemic. Everyone should learn the lessons from this and move forward together in fighting the pandemic,” he said.

He said that Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan was not criticising or censuring the State when he spoke about Kerala’s experience. Rather, he was pointing to Kerala’s experience to warn other States, where grand festivities were in the offing in the next few months.

Mr. Vijayan said that Kerala was following the scientific strategy of containing disease transmission as far as possible so that the peak of the epidemic would be delayed.

This strategy benefited the State so that the State got the time to prepare and strengthen the health system. The strategy had helped ensure that the health system was not overwhelmed, so that more lives could be saved. Even when the State was bracing to meet the peak of the epidemic, the case fatality rate could be kept low at the current 0.28% because of the scientific manner in which Kerala was managing the crisis, he claimed.

Rather than be proud of the State’s achievements, “some people” were out to discredit the State, he alleged.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cm-targets-opposition-for-covid-surge-post-onam/article32895781.ece

132,2020/10/19,Kerala bar bribery case back in focus,"Jose K. Mani offered me ₹10 cr., says bar owner.

The shadow of the bar licence renewal bribery case that rocked the Oommen Chandy government in 2015 and cost Kerala Congress (M) leader K.M. Mani his Cabinet berth seems to have reappeared to bedevil the ruling front and the Opposition in the election year.

Bar owner Biju Ramesh, the complainant in the case, claimed on Monday that KC(M) leader Jose K. Mani had offered him ₹10 crore that year to drop the accusation and the CPI(M) asked him not to entertain the entreaty. Mr. Mani rejected the charge and said it was another attempt to tarnish the political legacy of K.M. Mani. Mr. Ramesh is a former acting president of Kerala Bar Hotel Association (KBHA).

Mr. Ramesh’s statement comes close on the heels of the leak on Sunday of a questionable private investigation report of 2015 that claimed that K.M. Mani was the victim of a conspiracy to install the then Home Minister Ramesh Chennithala at the helm of the United Democratic Front government. It had named Mr. Ramesh as one of the conspirators.

The report said the plotters viewed K.M. Mani as supportive of Mr. Chandy and an impediment to their scheme. They, therefore, hatched the bar case to render him politically impotent. A private agency probed the matter confidentially at the behest of K.M. Mani.

The report appeared in the media after Left Democratic Front leaders signalled on Friday that they were not averse to accommodating Mr. Mani in the ruling front. Mr. Mani said the report did not have the imprimatur of the KC(M).

The charge against K.M. Mani was that he sought and received illegal gratification from KBHA to expedite the relicensing of more than 300 bars the government had shut down on the premise that they were unhygienic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-bar-bribery-case-back-in-focus/article32895346.ece
133,2020/10/19,Cases drop to 516 in capital,"357 contract the infection though local transmission

The daily COVID-19 caseload reported another encouraging drop on Monday also with just 516 people testing positive for the infection. In the past one week, the daily caseload had gone over the 800-mark only once.

The number of active cases in the district has fallen below the 10,000-mark and the recovery rate also remained high with 1,670 people recovering from the infection.

The death toll, meanwhile, has risen with three more recent deaths attributed to the infection.

The deceased included a 54-year-old woman from Edava; a 66-year-old woman from Kanjirampara, and a 53-year-old woman from Punnakkamugal.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Monday that the caseload in the district has witnessed a significant reduction. At the same time, there is an encouraging increase in the number of recoveries. On the other hand, inspections carried out in markets, shops and auto stands have revealed non-compliance with COVID-19 protocols.

“There is also a complaint that many shops in the district are not maintaining the visitors' register,”' he said.

As many as 357 people who tested positive over the past 24 hours contracted the infection though local transmission. The list also included 12 health workers, health officials said. The death toll in the district has touched 348.

On Monday, 9,205 people were being treated for COVID-19 in the district, health officials said.

In all, 2,217 more people have been quarantined in the district, taking the total number of quarantined to 30,022.

134,2020/10/19,Kerala Health Minister orders suspension of nursing officer who sent out audio clip,"Audio message suggested that negligence of Government Medical College Hospital staff resulted in death of COVID-19 patient

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja has ordered the suspension of a nursing officer at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Kalamassery, after an audio clip sent out by the officer suggested that negligence of the staff at the hospital while treating a COVID-19 patient had resulted in his death.

The Minister has also asked the Director of Medical Education to investigate the issue and submit a report.

In the audio clip, the officer identifies herself as Jalaja Devi, nursing officer at the Ernakulam Medical College. She explains that the audio clip was being sent out with instructions to the staff to prevent any lapses, before the team of health officials from the Centre arrived at the hospital on Sunday. In the clip, she asks staff to ensure that all equipment was in place and functioning, and sufficient oxygen supply was available.

“Patients’ oxygen masks are often not placed properly and ventilation tubes need to be checked. Patients have died because of this. Doctors have reported it, but have not seen it as our failure. We have not been punished because we work hard. The lives of patients have been lost because of small lapses like this and we have been told of these problems and asked to avoid such lapses. A patient named Haris was to be moved to the ward, but the ventilator tube was not placed properly. He died and his family had complained. But to protect us, doctors did not reveal this and it did not turn into a big problem,” the officer is heard saying.

The nursing officer had explained that she had only sent the clip out on an internal group as a reminder to the nurses in the ward to be more vigilant, said hospital Superintendent Peter Vazhayil. “There have been no lapses from our side. We do not know in what circumstances the nursing officer has made a statement like this. She has been on leave for a month and does not have the authority to make such a statement,” he said.

The patient named in the audio clip, C.K. Haris, was treated at the hospital for about a month and was given good care, he said. “The hospital has been treating critically-ill COVID-19 patients and our mortality rate is very low,” added Dr. Vazhayil.

Haris’s sister, C.K. Sainabi, a resident of Thuruthy, said the family had raised concerns with the doctors at the hospital soon after his death. “It was very sudden. He had spoken to his wife only a little while before he died,” she said. The 48-year-old resident of Palluruthy died on July 20, she said, adding that the family would write to the State government to ensure they were given an explanation on his death.

Baseless charges, says hospital

A statement issued by hospital Superintendent Dr. Vazhayil and Principal V. Satheesh said that the patient had diabetes and hypertension, besides COVID pneumonia. He was not on a mechanical ventilator but was on non-invasive ventilatory support in which a tube was unnecessary. Since he was on oxygen support, moving him to the ward was not possible, their statement said. He was given all necessary treatment for the 24 days that he was at the hospital. The contents of the audio clip were baseless and untrue, they said.

Chennithala writes to CM

Politicians, including Hibi Eden, MP, and V.K. Ebrahim Kunju, MLA, have written to the Chief Minister asking for an investigation and action against the concerned staffers. Mr. Eden, who met the family, said the patient’s relatives had been asked to purchase a BiPAP machine by the hospital. It was not returned to them after the patient’s death, but when they raised an issue, the hospital reimbursed the money paid for the device, he added.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has written to the Chief Minister slamming the Health Department’s decision to suspend the nursing officer and suggesting that the suspension was an attempt to cover up a lapse by the department. He has also called for an investigation by a team of medical experts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fr7yhv/article32897589.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19KI-PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-health-minister-orders-suspension-of-nursing-officer-who-sent-out-audio-clip/article32894501.ece

The Central health team that visited Thrissur district on Monday to review the COVID-19 preventive measures called up on the people to be more vigilant against spread of the disease.

Expressing satisfaction over the preventive works, the team said even mild negligence will lead to spurt in cases.

The team led by Dr. Ruchi Jain, deputy director of the regional centre of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in Thiruvananthapuram and Dr. Neeraj Kumar Gupta of the Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, attended the review meeting at the District Collectorate.

They visited government medical college hospital, COVID-19 first-line treatment centres, and containment zones.

District Collector S. Shanavas explained the preventive measures that have been taken in the district since the first case of the country was reported here on January 30.

The Collector explained about various preventive missions, activities of rapid response teams, process of tracing of contacts, awareness campaigns, screening tests at railway stations, bus stands and markets to the Central team. He also described the functioning of COVID-19 first-line and second-line treatment centres.

The team also visited KILA and Nattika first-line treatment centres and various containment zones such as Kunnamkulam, Choondal and Guruvayur.

After the weekend, Kerala’s COVID-19 case graph dipped on Monday to register 5,022 new cases, when 36,599 samples were tested in the past 24 hours .

The dip in cases was in proportion to the dip in the samples tested, as demonstrated by the test positivity rate, which stood at 13.7%, slightly higher than the previous day’s TPR.

The State again had more recoveries than new cases on Monday, with 7,469 patients being discharged from hospitals.

The cumulative case burden of the State now stands at 3,46,881. The total recoveries having touched 2,52,868 cases, the number of COVID patients currently in the State’s hospitals is 92,731.

There is a dip, albeit small, in the number of critically ill patients being treated in ICUs in the State even though it is not clear if this was due to the recovery or death of patients. The number of patients currently being treated in ICUs is 746, with 187 on ventilator support.

The Health Department added 21 more deaths which occurred in the past few weeks to the State’s official toll on Monday, taking the cumulative COVID toll in the State to 1,182. Ernakulam reported five of these deaths, Kozhikode four, three each in Thrissur and Thiruvananthapuram, two each in Malappuram and Kollam and one each in Kannur and Kasaragod.

Of the new cases reported on Monday, 4,963 cases (98.8%) are locally acquired infections, including 647 cases wherein the source of infection remains unknown. This includes 59 healthcare workers who also contracted the infection.

Among districts, Malappuram has been consistently reporting the highest number of cases in the State since the past few days, while the epidemic curve is beginning to plateau and go down in many other districts.

On Monday, Malappuram reported 910 cases, Kozhikode 772, Ernakulam 598, Thrissur 533, Thiruvananthapuram 516, Kollam 378, Alappuzha 340, Kannur 293, Palakkad 271, Kottayam 180, Kasaragod 120, Wayanad 51, Pathanamthitta 32 and Idukki 28 cases.

As far as active cases are concerned, Thiruvananthapuram, which has been reporting a dip in new cases and an improved recovery rate, has been pushed to the fourth place among districts.

137,2020/10/19,ACSM finishes modernisation project,"With the modernisation, 100 more would get jobs

Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan announced the completion of a project for modernisation and expansion of the Alleppey Cooperative Spinning Mills (ACSM), Kareelakulangara, on Monday.

“The spinning sector had collapsed due to various reasons. But the LDF government, through hard work, has been able to revive the sector. The government will initiate steps to make cotton available at reasonable rates,” Mr. Jayarajan said.

The Minister said that with the modernisation of the ACSM, at least 100 more people would get jobs. The production capacity of the ACSM had been increased by 20%.

As part of the modernisation and expansion of the ACSM, the spindle capacity has been increased to 25,200 by installing state-of- the-art technology machines. More than 13,000 spindles have been newly installed. The mill is now able to produce best quality yarn in combed and carded, single and doubled form. The project was implemented at a cost of ₹34 crore with assistance from the National Cooperative Development Corporation and State government.

The mill commenced commercial production in October 1999 with 6,048 spindles. Another 6,048 spindles were installed in December 2011.

The pilot run has been successful and the software would be available from November for consumers in COVID-19 containment zones, Board sources said on Monday. They said if the run was successful, the facility could be extended to consumers across the State.

There were complaints that Board’s meter readers were unable to complete their round of readings due to continuing COVID-19 restrictions. There were an average of four meter-readers per electricity section and they would take the readings in a cycle of 60 days. Delay in taking the readings resulted in consumer complaints in the past, Board sources said.

Using the software, KSEB would inform the consumer if the meter reading was due the following day. The SMS would provide a link using which the consumer can upload the reading. The link would provide the basic minimum details like consumer number and the previous reading. A consumer would also be able to take picture of the metre and upload it using the link. The details would then be forwarded to the electricity section concerned from where an online bill would be generated for the consumers.

The process should be easy for most of the consumers to use the software, KSEB sources said pointing that the Board had the mobile phone numbers of about a crore of its 1.25 crore customers.

Even those customers, who were billed on the basis of time of day metering would be able to use the software. In the meanwhile, KSEB was offering technology-based facilities to help consumers avoid visits to section offices. The facilities being made available include ‘e-Samayam’, whereby a customer would be able to make booking and receive a token and specific time slot to visit the section office and meet officials concerned.

Using other facilities being rolled out on November 1, consumers would be able to apply for category change, ownership change, phase conversion, change in connected load etc. using the online facilities.

The board also streamlined the documents that were needed for these services in such a way that the documents need not be submitted in the original.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kseb-software-to-help-people-in-containment-zones-take-reading/article32893239.ece
139,2020/10/19,ATIAL gears up to take over capital airport,"Seeks security clearance from Home Ministry and BCAS

Adani Trivandrum International Airport Ltd (ATIAL) of the Adani Group is gearing up to take over the 88-year-old airport from the Airports Authority of India as part of executing the 50-year lease agreement between the AAI and the ATIAL.

Meanwhile, the next move of the State government is being keenly watched. The State will have to sign a State support agreement to hand over the airport to the AEL and the stance of the State is crucial. The government is likely to back out from the acquisition of eight hectares needed from Vallakkadavu-Vayyamoola area for a ₹600-crore integrated terminal on the city side.

“Already, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) and the Union Ministry of Home Affairs have been approached for the mandatory security clearance for the board of directors of the ATIAL,” sources associated with the leasing process told The Hindu.

Once the security clearance is obtained, the lease agreement will be executed. After signing the pact, the ATIAL will have to submit the performance bank guarantee to the AAI. ATIAL personnel will fly down to the capital and start observing the airport operations closely for two months. After the observation period, the ATIAL will take over the commercial operations as per the commercial operation date (COD).

After three months of taking over the commercial airport operations, officers of the DGM and above grade of the AAI working in the airport will be sent back to the AAI. Others up to the AGM grade will be retained in the airport as deemed ‘deputation.’

In the three years, the ATIAL will have to give two offers for 60% of the AAI personnel on the rolls and they will have to decide on staying with the private player. If 60% do not accept the offer, the Adani Group will have to pay the salary and other benefits to these staff till retirement.

A ‘novaton clause” will be introduced in the pact to change the existing agreement of the AAI for various works entrusted to the ATIAL. The power of attorney will be given by the AAI to the ATIAL for 50 years to the designated officer. The airport operations will be under a Chief Airport Officer.

Compulsory clauses are in the agreement to be inked to usher development of the airport as it has to be handed over back after 50 years to the AAI. Air Traffic Communication and Air Navigation Services will remain with the AAI during the lease period.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/o0u0g2/article32437244.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THTRIVANDRUMINTERNATIONALAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/atial-gears-up-to-take-over-capital-airport/article32893191.ece
140,2020/10/19,State scores high in creation of durable assets,"Conscious thrust on asset creation to shrug off criticism that MGNREGS is no useful work

For long, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has faced much criticism as something which involves just the clearing of shrubs and no useful work as such. However, a conscious thrust on creation of durable assets has led to a sea change in the situation on the ground, with the creation of thousands of irrigation ponds and wells, cattle sheds, buildings for anganwadis, compound walls for schools and village roads.

It has reflected in an increase in the State's material expenditure, of the annual spendings from a mere 8.51% in 2018-19 to 14.26% in 2019-20 and 34.46% this year, as per the data till October 15. The material expenditure, a gauge for asset creation, is capped at 40% of the labour budget. National average this year is 26.53%.

Vegetable cultivation

The MGNREGS workers also played a key role in preparation of several pieces of land for vegetable cultivation as part of the Subhiksha Kerala project with an aim for self-sufficiency in vegetable production. For the Haritha Keralam Mission's Pachathuruthu (green islets) project for the creation of mini-forests in 1,250 plots, the MGNREGS workers were employed. They have been given the responsibility of upkeep of the forests for the next five years.

The workers were part of the mission's river rejuvenation projects in various districts. As part of water conservation activities, they have been involved in the creation of check-dams, revival of water sources, well recharging and creation of rainwater pits.

""In the early days of the scheme, the focus was only on providing employment. In 2014, the act was amended to include asset creation as one of the objectives. Yet, we took some time in shifting focus. In 2018, we took a conscious decision in this direction, which has now started showing results. The creation of individual assets like irrigation wells or cattle or poultry sheds will also ensure sustainable income for families dependent on agriculture or animal husbandry. It has ensured an increase in employment provided to 3.99 crore work days till September compared to 3.32 crore work days during the same period in the previous year"" said an official from the MGNREGS State mission.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wghl81/article32896373.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20tv-MGNREGScol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-scores-high-in-creation-of-durable-assets/article32892702.ece
141,2020/10/19,Kerala HC dismisses petitions challenging the leasing out of Thiruvananthapuram airport,"A batch of writ petitions challenging the leasing out of Thiruvananthapuram International Airport by Airport Authority of India was dismissed by the Division Bench of the Kerala High Court as it found that there was absolutely no valid ground to interfere in the proceedings that were challenged.

The challenge in the petitions was against the privatisation, the declared policy of the Union Government. Regarding airports, it was Public-Private-Participation, which had been statutorily declared by the incorporation of Section 12A to the Airport Authority of India Act. There was no challenge to the statutory provision of the Act, the court noted.

Interference to a policy framed by the elected Government was trite and difficult. The feeble challenge raised against the government policy was devoid of merit, dismissing the petitions, Justice K. Vinod Chandran and Justice C.D. Dias concluded.

The State had nominated the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation to bid under the Request For Proposal (RFP) issued by the Airport Authority of India, with a Right of First Refusal on the maximum bid coming within the range of ten per cent. The bid failed and the State and the Corporation turned against the very RFP under which they participated, with an edge over others, the court noted.

The petitions of the Corporation and the State and the case set up by them was a classic example of the proverbial sour grapes, the Bench noted.

The writ petition of the Airport Authority Employees' Union had challenged the Press Note published revealing the approval of the Cabinet for leasing out of three Airports at Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Mangaluru. Though there was a prayer challenging the lease of all the six airports, the court found that the RFPs were separate which were not produced or challenged. The challenge was confined to the RFP for Thiruvananthapuram International Airport. The petition was liable to be dismissed for the reason that the Letter of Award issued to the successful bidder was not challenged, the court pointed out.

The writs filed by two individuals were filed without establishing their locus standi. The court found them to be mischievous and an abuse of process of the Court and rejected it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-hc-dismisses-petitions-challenging-the-leasing-out-of-thiruvananthapuram-airport/article32892216.ece

The court had earlier restrained the Enforcement Directorate from arresting the official till the date. The court will consider the two cases on the date, ordered Justice Ashok Menon.

The official had earlier moved the anticipatory bail on the day the High Court.

During the argument, the counsel for the official submitted that he had presented himself before all investigating agencies for hours together for interrogation and was fully cooperating with the agencies. He also submitted that he had been interrogated for over 90 hours by various agencies and travelled over 600 hours from his home at Thiruvananthapuram and back for appearing before various agencies.

The official further submitted that he was being made a pawn in a political game for some other purposes. He also submitted that he was willing to be present before any agency at any time.

Regarding his hospitalisation in Thiruvananthapuram, the official submitted that there were attempts even to forcefully discharge him from the Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, where he was admitted.

Opposing the bail plea, the counsel for the Customs sought time for filing a counter-statement in the case. The official was adopting a belligerent attitude towards interrogation and was evading answers to many questions.

Leader of the Opposition in the Kerala Assembly Ramesh Chennithala has alleged that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and his suspended Principal Secretary M. Sivasankar are now “mutually helping each other” in the gold smuggling case.

He told mediapersons in Kozhikode on Monday that the “hospitalisation drama” of Mr. Sivasankar was only a tactic to delay his arrest in the case of smuggling gold through the diplomatic channel. The Chief Minister could not play hide and seek for a long time. The probe by the Central agencies was on the right track. It was better for Mr. Vijayan to resign from his post before the probe agencies arrested him, Mr. Chennithala said.

He charged that the public outrage was intensifying day by day against the government which was “steeped in corruption and nefarious activities”. The Congress-led United Democratic Front would observe ‘Kerala Piravi’ (November 1) as ‘hypocrisy day’ against the State government. About 2 lakh activists would take part in the protest at 20,000 centres in the State, he said.

Bar bribery scam

Responding to questions, Mr. Chennithala dismissed a report that appeared in the name of Kerala Congress (M) which claimed that he was the kingpin behind the conspiracy against Kerala Congress (M) leader and then Finance Minister K.M. Mani in the bar bribery scam. Even his son Jose. K Mani had dismissed such a report. It was the CPI (M) which had physically attacked Mani outside and inside the Legislative Assembly, he alleged.

145,2020/10/19,Sabarimala pilgrim tests COVID positive,"Asymptomatic patient is from A.P.

A 57-year-old pilgrim bound for the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple in Pathanamthitta tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Sunday.

The person, a native of Chittur district in Andhra Pradesh tested positive during an antigen test held at the COVID-19 testing centre in Nilackal. As the person was asymptomatic, he has been admitted to a COVID first-line treatment centre (FLTC) in Perinad.

A 24-year-old pilgrim who had accompanied him tested negative. He was shifted to a COVID care centre for observation.

Antigen test

“The duo had come from Andhra Pradesh via Chennai by train. After alighting at Chengannur, they took a taxi to Nilackal. They were subjected to antigen test as the certificate that proved them negative for the disease had been issued four days earlier,” said R. Santosh, Deputy District Medical Officer, Pathanamthitta.

Since Saturday, officials have tested 211 people, including 168 pilgrims, across the three testing centres at Pampa and Nilackal. Of these, only one person has tested positive so far.

Besides the testing centres, three casualty units, one each at Nilackal, Pampa, and Sannidhanam too have been set up to address medical emergencies.

Strict restrictions

In view of the COVID-19 situation, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has laid down strict directives for the pilgrims to follow during the temple’s opening for five days, starting from October 17.

The number of pilgrims has been restricted to 250 a day. All are required to produce a certificate testing negative for COVID-19, 48 hours before reaching Pampa.

148,2020/10/19,Up the employability quotient,"How skill training can make one ready for the workplace

Skill education or vocational training is typically the cornerstone of any economy. Ironically, although India is considered to be a melting pot of knowledge and skills, the vast majority of its educated youth lack ‘employability quotient’. Equally problematic has been the quality of India’s vocational education content and delivery systems. Now that the digital era is here to stay, here is how the skill education sector can leverage this new medium and prepare the country for a new-age economy:

High-quality content dissemination: Digitisation allows unprecedented systematisation of instructions, knowledge and training material and storage. This has ensured a great degree of standardisation and benchmarking in terms of quality. The skill education sector can leverage this by preparing, curating and using this off-the-shelf high-quality standardised material (such as video lectures) for dissemination, based on learners’ needs.

Better training facilities for support staff: Digitisation makes it easier for the governments and industry authorities to recognise and give accreditation and certification to training programmes and material. The skill-providing industry/institution must make all this accessible to its learning community. For instance, a start-up can use online instructions or training material from global leaders to train or upskill its staff.

Live interactions: With some traditional technology giants offering free-to-use video conferencing and group interaction apps for collaborative learning, live instructions from a single point of delivery can be delivered to any number of learners, irrespective of geographies and time zones, while reducing infrastructure and travel costs.

Flexibility to choose online and classroom training: Some skill education providers offer both classroom and online training, so collaboration with ed-tech companies and applications that take into account the low Internet bandwidth and erratic connections can be explored.

Higher demand for certain sectors: Digitisation has led to new-age careers and professions spawned by new technologies. Thus, there has been a demand for professionals in Banking, Finance, AI, machine learning, data science and mobile development, among others. This deficit can be addressed through online courses and training.

However, data penetration is still a major challenge, especially in rural areas. In many training models, physical presence in a closed environment and interactive exchanges are needed, and this is possible only in classroom pedagogy. Only when things are back to normal will we understand if people are ready to adapt to the new norm or if theybprefer classroom training for a wholesome experience.

149,2020/10/19,It was a road trip without a destination: Pankaj Tripathi on working with Anurag Basu in ‘Ludo’,"Meet the cast of the upcoming Netflix film ‘Ludo’, which will première on the platform this Deepavali

Virtual conferences are a lot more cooler than what we are used to. For one, you save time and effort, it is easier to navigate on the Internet and more importantly, you can turn up in shorts without being judged, like how Aditya Roy Kapur did when he, along with the ensemble cast of Ludo, joined together for the trailer launch on Monday. “For every virtual event, I am going to push for this [of costume],” said Aditya, with a laugh.

It is a season for anthologies on streaming platforms. Following the recent announcement of its their Tamil anthology Paava Kathaigal, Netflix has rolled out its plan for the big Deepavali release, with what appears to be a comedy anthology, Ludo, directed by Anurag Basu who returns to direction after the 2017 Jagga Jasoos, which was marred by production issues and ultimately failed at the box office, despite decent reviews. Basu was moderating the live session, giving us an insight into its world and what the characters have to offer.

Shades of life?

A typical game of ludo consists of four colours — Red, Green, Yellow and Blue. Going by the trailer, each colour, in this case, seems to represent the theme or shades that individual story/character is dealing with.

When Basu gave a brief to the sort of man Rajkummar Rao would be playing, what caught the latter’s attention was his “aloo” analogy. “You told me that the character is like aloo...people would like him no matter what. I found that interesting and knew you wouldn’t disappoint,” he said.

Rajkummar recalled the reaction Basu had when he looked like a young Mithun Chakraborty, when he gave the look test for the film. “That is when it hit me, that my character dances for everything, irrespective of the situation he finds himself in. I thought, ‘why not base my character on Mithun Da’.”

The film also stars Dangal girl Fatima Sana Shaikh in the lead. Basu said that he had not written a character like Pinky (Fatima) before and was curious to know what the actor thought of her. “I’ve heard that you don’t write your scripts in the first place,” said Fatima breaking into a chuckle and broaching on something Anurag Basu has often been accused of and received praise for, in equal measure. She added, “Pinky was so raw and this is the first time I am taking up a character like her. You [Basu] were forcing me to explore her and I really enjoyed that experience.”

Aditya Roy Kapur and Sanya Malhotra play a couple in their segment. Sanya’s character might be perceived as a “gold digger” and Basu was keen on knowing if she had any reservations sinking her teeth into it. “I wouldn’t call her that because gold digger has a negative connotation. She has formed a clear picture of her future and is precise of what she wants, whom she was going to marry, and how she would spend her life,” said Sanya.

Aditya, on the other hand, was taken by surprise when he was asked to give his two cents on Mughal architecture — his character is Akash Chauhan, a doctorate in Mongolian art in Mughal architecture. “This is the first time I didn’t come anywhere close to researching for this character,” he said.

The loveable gangster

The one story or character that connects the arc of Ludo is that of Pankaj Tripathi, who plays a gangster. Yet again. “If you give such lovely performances as a gangster, people will start liking them yaar,” quipped Basu. Sharing his experience, Tripathi said, “I always like taking road trips. This film was like that; a road trip but without a destination. We don’t know what will happen next in life’s script, but in cinema we do.”

For Malayalam actor Pearle Maaney, the entire journey was akin to visiting Disneyland. Her portion has shades of blue and she stars alongside Rohit Suresh Saraf. “There are some great and experimental movies coming from Malayalam cinema. But, in your case, I felt like a child that went to Disneyland...it was like a dream,” she said.

Abhishek Bachchan does miss promoting the film with his colleagues, especially the “laughs and food” that come with it. His portion features child actor Inayat Verma and they seem to share a warm relationship. “When you have an actor who is talented and charming, you don’t have to do much. I completely leaned on Basu’s vision,” said Abhishek.

Inayat chipped in to add: “I never saw him as a star since he was down to earth. He took care of me like his daughter [Aradhya]. That is why our bonding was natural.”

“She just cut me to size,” laughed Abhishek.

Retired Sri Lankan cricketing icon Muthiah Muralitharan asked actor Vijay Sethupathi, who was roped into starring in his biopic, 800, to “step away” from the project so as to not encounter problems in his career in future.

Vijay Sethupathi shared Muralitharan’s statement with a message ‘Nandri, Vanakkam’ as if to suggest that he won’t be starring in 800.

Writer of Muralitharan biopic: ‘There are shades of grey in 800'

In a statement from United Arab Emirates, former Sri Lankan legend Muralitharan, who is currently working as a bowling coach for Sunrisers Hyderabad team playing in the Indian Premier League, said that “he doesn’t want to be reason to derail the career of a great artist like Vijay Sethupathi.”

“He should not suffer any unnecessary obstacles in his career as an artist in future. Therefore, I request him to move away,” he said.

Muralitharan said that he has never felt “fatigued because of setbacks and has always won against all odds to reach where I have today.”

“I consented for my biopic to be made because it would provide inspiration and confidence to future generations and young cricketers. But there have been many obstacles. I hope that this film would be made despite these obstacles. I have been given assurances by the production house that they would make an announcement soon and I will stand by them for all their efforts,” he said.

As soon as the official motion poster of 800 was launched, political leaders and many from the Tamil film industry said that the actor should not act in the biopic of a person who had earlier made comments that was perceived to be in support of the war waged by Sri Lankan forces against LTTE, which resulted in deaths of thousands of innocent civilians.

The overwhelming opposition faced by Vijay Sethupathi prompted a clarification from Muralitharan who said that his statements made in the past about the civil war that ended in 2009 were taken out of context. He had said, “I did not support the killings of innocent people and I would not do it.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/69n7nh/article32879350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vijayjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/muthiah-muralitharan-asks-vijay-sethupathi-to-step-away-from-his-biopic/article32892162.ece

153,2020/10/19,‘Preponderance of probabilities enough to punish public servants’,"HC dismisses VAO’s petition against stoppage of increment for three years

Preponderance of probabilities was sufficient to punish public servants under the Discipline and Appeal Rules, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court observed while dismissing the petition filed by a Village Administrative Officer (VAO) who was punished for misconduct.

The court was hearing the petition filed by R. Vasantha from Dindigul district who challenged the punishment of stoppage of increment for three years with cumulative effect awarded to her on a charge of misconduct.

Disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the petitioner after she granted permission to a woman landowner to cut seemai karuvelam trees that had grown on her land. Actually, the Revenue Inspector concerned should have given the permission.

Justice S.M. Subramaniam observed that the punishment imposed by the disciplinary authorities as well as the appellate authorities could be modified in rare circumstances by the High Court in a writ petition.

It could be in the case of punishment not being proportionate to the gravity of the charge. As far as the disciplinary authorities were concerned, the standard of proof required was not akin to that of the standard of proof required in a criminal or a civil case, the court said.

The allegation set out in the charge memo, the materials available on record and consideration by the disciplinary authority as well as the enquiry officers were sufficient to arrive at a conclusion that the punishment was imposed in accordance with law.

In the present case, a charge memo was issued and the petitioner denied the charge. An enquiry officer was appointed and the petitioner was given a reasonable opportunity to defend her case. Thereafter, the finding was arrived at by the officer.

There was no perversity on the part of the disciplinary authority in accepting the finding and imposing the punishment on the petitioner, the court said, and observed that the punishment imposed was in consonance with the rules in force.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/preponderance-of-probabilities-enough-to-punish-public-servants-madurai-high-court/article32894029.ece
154,2020/10/19,Plea to arrest Inspector in man’s murder case,"Wife of the deceased petitions Collector, seeking speedy action, govt. job for her

THOOTHUKUDI

Wife of murdered packaged drinking water trader Selvan, 30, of Chokkankudiyiruppu in the district has appealed to Collector Sandeep Nanduri to ensure early arrest of Thattarmadam Police Inspector Harikrishnan for “his role in the murder” of her husband.

Ms. Jeevitha, wife of Selvan, submitted a petition to the Collector in this connection on Monday. After Selvan was kidnapped and murdered by a gang on September 17, Thattarmadam police arrested AIADMK functionary Thirumanavel of nearby Usarathukudiyiruppu and six of his supporters.

However, the family of the deceased alleged that the murder was orchestrated at the instance of Mr. Harikrishnan, who was also cited as an accused in the case filed by Thisaiyanvilai police as the badly injured Selvan had been abandoned by the assailants near Thisaiyanvilai and was rushed to the Government Hospital there, where doctors declared him ‘brought dead’.

Even as Thisaiyanvilai police were about to commence the investigation, the case was transferred to the CB–CID, which is investigating the murder that triggered widespread outrage here as it happened just 90 days after the custodial deaths of Sattankulam trader Jayaraj and his son Benicks.

Though Harikrishnan was placed under suspension after his name figured in the FIR, he was not arrested as demanded by the aggrieved family.

Ms. Jeevitha said, “The government, as promised by the Collector, should give our family a green house and a government job for me on an early note. The Collector has assured us to look into our demands.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/plea-to-arrest-inspector-in-mans-murder-case-thoothukudi/article32893318.ece

Tamil Film Active Producers Association president Bharathirajaa on Monday urged actors and technicians who have taken a remuneration of more than ₹10 lakh to accept a 30% pay cut and complete the films delayed due to covid-19 pandemic.

In an appeal to actors and technicians, Mr. Bharathirajaa said that most films have found that their revenue streams - satellite rights, OTT and theatrical rights - have dried up due to the pandemic.

""Producers are unable to pay back even the interest payment to the lenders. In this situation, it is the responsibility of all actors and technicians to come forward and help the producers, whose films are under production and are stuck due to this lockdown,"" he said.

He said that the producers can manage this situation only if their total investment reduces by at least 40-50%. Mr. Bharathirajaa cited the examples of Telugu and Malayalam film industries where the artistes and technicians have agreed to take a 30-50% cut in their salaries and urged the Tamil counterparts to do the same as well.

""In Tamil cinema, a few actors have come forward to reduce their salaries by 30%, considering the difficult situation of their producers CCTV. While we appreciate their kind gesture, it is not enough. Only when all the actors, actresses and technicians, who get a remuneration of ₹10 lakh and above come forward and accept a reduction of 30% in their salaries, producers can reduce their overall cost, complete their films and release them without any financial difficulty,"" he said.

Mr. Bharathirajaa said that this request is only for films stuck in production and not for new films that are going to be signed in future.

Addressing a virtual press conference, he also cautioned that the achievement could be undone if people dropped the guard.

He urged the people to continue observing safety norms.

“No death has been reported in the Union Territory today and the number of positive cases has also come down projecting the picture of the pandemic on a declining trend,” Mr. Narayanasamy said.

However, people should continue to observe safety norms, especially given some reports of reinfection of recovered patients, he said.

The Chief Minister said 17 per cent of the 15 lakh population in Puducherry had been tested so far.

He said for over six months, teams of medical personnel, in association with staff of other departments, including police, had been putting in dedicated service to help restore normalcy in a phased manner here.

“We have taken care of manpower requirements, ramped up infrastructure and other facilities in government hospitals entrusted with the task of treating COVID-19 patients,” he added.

164,2020/10/19,Critically endangered Asian king vultures sighted in Sigur plateau,"Experts believe the species may be re-establishing itself in the region

The sighting of a pair of critically endangered Asian king vultures and a juvenile in the Sigur plateau is a cause for optimism that the species may be re-establishing itself in the region, experts say.

The population of the Asian king vulture, like most vulture species in India, has crashed over the last five decades.

The Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), encompassing both the Sigur plateau and the Moyar valley, is believed to be home to 12-14 individuals. Since research began around a decade ago, not a single nesting site of the species has been found in the MTR.

A. Samson, a research biologist from the Bombay Natural History Society who has been studying vultures inhabiting the Sigur plateau and the Moyar valley for the last decade, said the Asian king vulture, also known as the red-headed vulture, used to be seen across Tamil Nadu, right up to Kanniyakumari, till 50 years ago.

“Despite extensive searches over the last decade in the MTR, not a single nesting site of the species has been discovered,” he said.

The images of the three vultures — two adults and a juvenile — were captured on two separate days by lawyer M. Santhanaraman on a visit to the area recently. He told The Hindu that the record hinted at the possibility of a nesting site nearby.

“If nesting sites are identified, any step to ensure the conservation of the area can be taken,” he said.

“One way we can help bolster the population of vultures is by ensuring that the Kedarhalla stream, which, during the drought years, goes bone dry, is maintained as a perennial stream. During the drought that hit the district in 2016, many trees that the vultures depend on for nesting, like the Terminalia arjuna, died. If the streams are made perennial by ensuring a mean flow throughout the year, the vulture nesting sites using the landscape can be protected,” Mr. Santhanaraman said.

B. Ramakrishnan, Assistant Professor at the Department of Zoology and Wildlife Biology at the Government Arts College, Udhagamandalam, said the sighting of a juvenile Asian king vulture was a sign that the population might be increasing.

“This particular species of vulture only feeds on fresh carcasses, and is known for tracking tigers so that it can feed off its kills,” he said.

He added that the increase in the number of tigers in the buffer zone of the reserve could lead to availability of more food for the vultures, thus helping the species re-establish itself in the region.

Bharathidasan, secretary of Arulagam, an NGO working on vulture conservation, feels it is too premature to make any conclusion from this one-off sighting.

Boosting the numbers

“As the population of these vultures is so low, a single poisoning event could wipe out the entire species. Hence, we need to think of establishing captive breeding centres and other means to boost the number of red-headed vultures in the region,” he said.

“Other means to help the species — establishing feeding stations and captive breeding of the vultures and eventual release — could also help,” said T. Murugavel, project coordinator for the Environment Monitoring and Action Initiating.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5etl51/article32888618.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THVULTURES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/critically-endangered-asian-king-vultures-sighted-in-sigur-plateau/article32888619.ece
165,2020/10/19,135 statues fenced to prevent defacement,"Initiative by Ariyalur police aimed at preventing law and order problems

To prevent law and order problems arising out of the defacement of leaders’ statues, the Ariyalur district police and local body officials have fenced 135 statues in their jurisdiction. Stray incidents of defacement of statues in certain parts of the State, including Tiruchi and neighbouring Thanjavur district, have triggered widespread protests in recent weeks.

The Ariyalur district, encompassing Ariyalur and Jayamkondam sub-divisions, has 140 statues in total. Of them, 135 are in public places. Among them are statues of Tamil savant Tiruvalluvar, former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Mahatma Gandhi, B.R. Ambedkar, Periyar, Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, former Chief Ministers C.N. Annadurai, M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa and former Congress-cum-TMC leader G.K. Moopanar. Besides, there are five statues on private premises.

The district police, in association with local body authorities and with the cooperation of political parties, have installed fences around 135 statues, said V.R. Srinivasan, Superintendent of Police, Ariyalur. In some places, those who had installed the statues erected fences themselves, he added.

The Ariyalur police began the exercise in early September and completed it in a month, Mr. Srinivasan said.

In November last, a statue of Thiruvalluvar at Pillaiyarpatti near Thanjavur was defaced by miscreants. A statue of Periyar was defaced in Coimbatore in July this year. A Periyar statue was defaced at Samathuvapuram in Inamkulathur village near Tiruchi last month, sparking protests.

“The statues have a lot of sentiment attached to them and their defacement triggers instant protests, leading to law and order problems. The fencing put up around the statues is a major preventive measure that would thwart miscreants’ attempts to deface them. Further, the fencing acts as a first layer of defence,” Mr. Srinivasan said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/7kb15o/article32888616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THSTATUE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/135-statues-fenced-to-prevent-defacement/article32888617.ece
166,2020/10/19,Inconsistencies in NEET answer sheets alleged,"Candidate takes up the issue with NTA

A medical aspirant from Coimbatore has alleged inconsistencies in the NEET Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) sheet downloaded by him. The candidate, K.S. Manoj from Karumathampatty, said the OMR sheet he downloaded before and after the announcement of NEET results were different.

“I have escalated this to the National Testing Agency through their helpdesk,” he said. A few other students from other parts also said that they encountered similar inconsistencies.

“I downloaded my OMR sheet first on October 11 and matched it with the answer key, based on advice from the coaching centre where I had taken up a NEET crash-course. I found that I had scored 594 and the same score was shown when I downloaded the OMR sheet again on October 15. The score was the same when I matched the OMR sheet with the final answer key around 5 p.m. on October 16. However, my score was 248 when the results were announced,” he said.

Mr. Manoj said that the OMR sheet he downloaded at around 8.30 p.m. on October 16, after the announcement of the results, was different from the ones he had downloaded earlier.

He shared the two OMR sheets with mediapersons.

According to G.B. Ramprakash, founder of Tech4All, who had taken up the case of poor translation of English scientific terms in NEET question papers in 2018, said such errors were reported in other States as well.

He said errors could creep in the reading of bar codes due to glitches.

“At present, it is only an allegation. If the candidate has downloaded the OMR sheets, he can send it as hard copies to the NTA and lodge a complaint. The NTA should take the complaint seriously and provide hard copies of the OMR sheets. This will ensure total transparency,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/inconsistencies-in-neet-answer-sheets-alleged/article32888600.ece
167,2020/10/19,Stalin seeks creation of employment scheme,"‘Panel probing Jaya’s death weakened’

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Sunday said that even though former RBI Governor C. Rangarajan, appointed to assess the economy of the State in the wake of the pandemic, had submitted his report, the government had not taken any efforts to implement it.

In a statement in Chennai, he said the government had not made public the committee’s recommendations, and nor had it bothered to act on them.

Recalling reports that the recommendations include an MGNREGA-type employment scheme for the urban areas, he said the government had not announced any such policy for the urban areas, so far.

“Mr. Rangarajan had recommended the lifting of the lockdown to revive the economy. But the AIADMK government has not created any favourable condition for its [complete] lifting. This has resulted in the stagnation and loss of employment,” he said.

Accusing Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami of diverting people’s attention from the problems, by citing MOUs signed with industrial houses, Mr. Stalin said the Chief Minister should realise there is no magic wand to revive the economy.

“The government should generate employment in rural areas and create a special scheme for urban residents, without any delay,” he said.

Arumughaswamy panel

In a separate statement, Mr. Stalin said the AIADMK government had constituted the Justice (retd.) Arumughaswamy Commission, to probe former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s hospitalisation and death, only as an “eyewash”. He accused the government of having subsequently made the existence of the panel “meaningless”, and said that when the DMK is elected to power, it would unmask those responsible for her death and bring them to justice.

He said Justice (retd.) A. Arumughaswamy had made a strong charge that the Advocate General and the Additional Advocate General were merely watching the litigation, that stalled the panel’s proceedings.

The retired judge, Mr. Stalin said, had openly levelled the allegation that the litigation was being delayed.

“His allegations have exposed that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam have deliberately delayed the case to protect their seats,” the DMK leader said.

He said that Justice (retd.) Arumughaswamy had registered his complaint in a letter written to the State government, and it was clear proof that the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister were not interested in unravelling the conspiracy and completing the case. Recalling Mr. Panneerselvam’s “dharma yutham” at the mausoleum of Jayalalithaa to expose the efforts to destroy the evidence in connection with her death, Mr. Stalin said it was a farcical drama. Subsequently, Mr. Palaniswami had announced the inquiry Commission.

“Even though the Commission was asked to submit its report in three months, it was not able to do it even after 37 months. Mr. Panneerselvam has not appeared before the Commission for the last 22 months and he approached the High Court for a stay,” Mr. Stalin said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/wrpmvo/article32888580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stalin-seeks-creation-of-employment-scheme/article32888581.ece
168,2020/10/19,Efforts on to bring back Chola royal charter,"Preserved in the Netherlands, it was a sasana to a Buddhist vihara

A royal charter or a sasana of the Chola kings, lost 300 years ago from Tamil Nadu, is now being preserved in the Leiden University in the Netherlands. Commonly referred to as the “Leiden plates”, it was issued by the kings to a Buddhist vihara.

With the Netherlands relooking at its colonial collections, and planning to return over 10,000 artefacts to the source nations or former colonies, art enthusiasts say it is time for India to make efforts to get the crowning glory of the Cholas back.

The charter has two sections — one in Sanskrit and another in Tamil — and the 21 copper plates are held together by a massive bronze ring bearing the regal seal of Rajendra Chola. They also deal with the geneology of the Chola dynasty and the reign of king Rajaraja I (985-1012 AD), the father of Rajendra Chola (1012-1042 AD). It proclaims that 26 villages bordering Anaimangalam were donated for a Buddhist shrine (vihara), known as Chulamanivarmavihara, built by the Malay king of Sriwijaya in Nagapattinam, a port town on the Coromandel coast, said S. Vijay Kumar, art enthusiast and co-founder of the India Pride Project.

The provenance states that the copper plates were donated in 1862, by successors, to the estate of professor Hendrik Arent Hamaker. This charter and another one were brought from India by Florentius Camper, minister of faith in Batavia, in 1703-1712. Recently, a colonial repatriation committee in the Netherlands asked Dutch museums to return artefacts stolen by colonists to countries such as Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Some museums have decided to return more than 1,00,000 exhibits, taken by force, during the colonial times.

“The legal case for the restitution of the two Leiden grants are unclear, as the circumstances around how Mr. Camper obtained them from India and brought them to Leiden in 1700 are not available,” said Mr. Kumar. However, India should appeal to the Netherlands for the return of these important plates, especially considering the recent initiative of the select committee, advising the Dutch government to return colonial collections to the erstwhile colonies, since the case of the Leiden plates is no different from the objects returning home, he said. “We hope they are returned, so they can be displayed, rather reunited with Rajendra Chola’s grand edifice in the Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple,” he said.

The charters are seen as testimony to how the Buddhist centre of learning and spirituality flourished, benefiting from the benevolence of king Rajaraja, who built a Brihadeeswara temple in Thanjavur. “The copper plates are an important evidence on the history of the Chola period. They also talk about the conquests, accomplishments and expeditions to the far east,” retired archaeological officer C. Santhalingam said.

Thangam Thennarasu, DMK MLA and former School Education Minister, said, “Since they are returning artefacts to the source nations, it is the right time for the State and the Centre to take steps to retrieve them. We call the charters ‘Anaimangalam’ copper plates.”

“Anbil plates are also very important. They give a lot of information about Chola history. No one knows its present location. The government should find their current location and retrieve them,” said Mr. Thennarasu.

Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture Minister Ma Foi K. Pandiarajan told The Hindu, “We are seized of the matter and have taken steps to retrieve the precious copper plates from the Netherlands. We have requested the Union Ministry of Culture to expedite the process,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/r0gyjf/article32888553.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201011-WA0009,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/efforts-on-to-bring-back-chola-royal-charter/article32888554.ece

173,2020/10/19,Tribals stage protest against LRS in Scheduled Area,"New laws dilute provisions of 1 of 70 Act which protect rights of tribals, say protesters

Assailing the reported move to implement the newly rolled out Layout Regularisation Scheme (LRS) and other provisions of the new Revenue Act in the Scheduled Areas of the district, scores of Adivasis took out a protest march in Bhadrachalam on Monday.

The demonstrators later laid siege to the office of the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) in the temple town to press for protection of the constitutional rights of tribal people as guaranteed under the Fifth Schedule of Constitution.

The demonstration was organised under the aegis of the Adivasi Samkshema Parishath (ASP) and a host of other Adivasi organisations to press for their charter of demands.

Addressing the demonstration, ASP national president D. Nageswara Rao alleged that the LRS and other “detrimental” provisions contained in the new Revenue Act, recently enacted by the State government, posed a threat to the interests of Adivasis inhabiting the Scheduled Areas.

“Any move to thrust these arbitrary measures on Scheduled Areas would dilute the Land Transfer Regulation (LTR) Act (1 of 70) and other legislations governing the Fifth Schedule areas, meant to prevent encroachment of tribals’ lands by non-tribals,” he warned.

Other speakers demanded that the ongoing process of LRS and survey/enumeration of non-agricultural properties for the purpose of updating property data into Dharani portal be stopped forthwith in the Scheduled Areas to avoid contravention of the LTR and other legislations relating to tribal people living in Fifth Schedule areas.

They sought sanction of pattas to all the “podu cultivators” as per the provisions of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006.

Several Adivasi leaders demanded that the Central government should enact an Ordinance to ensure continuation of 100% reservations to the ST candidates for the teacher posts in the Scheduled Areas.

ASP State president Uika Shankar and others spoke.

Leaders of Bhadrachalam Adivasi Samithi, Adivasi Konda Reddi Sangham, Tudum Debba Adivasi organisation and Adivasi Vidyarthi Samkshema Parishat extended their support to the dharna.

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy has asked every Congress worker in the State to work with unity and discipline to create history by winning the bye-election to Dubbak Assembly Constituency and forthcoming elections to GHMC.

Speaking during the 30th Rajiv Sadbhavana Yatra organised by the party here on Monday, he alleged that the ruling party was resorting to exploitation of people at any given opportunity and it was time people taught a fitting lesson to the ruling party by defeating it both in Dubbak and elections to GHMC and other urban local bodies over the next few months.

AICC in-charge of party affairs in Telangana Manickam Tagore expressed sympathies with people of Hyderabad City suffering caused by floods and assured that the Congress party would extend help to such families in whatever measure it could. Stating that Congress party always believed in communal harmony and social justice, he recollected how former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi would always think about future generations when he was in office, while the focus of the present leadership of the country was only on the elections and electronic voting machines.

Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader M. Bhatti Vikramarka alleged that several parties in the country were trying to gain electorally by igniting passions between religions and castes and it was time people taught a lesson to such parties.

175,2020/10/19,Tying up bunches of paddy to save the crop,"Farmers in the district make all out efforts to save standing crop

The recent incessant rains and resultant flood in canals and streams has not only disrupted normal life but also has flooded the fields posing a risk to the standing crop.

Life has turned upside down for almost all farmers. Every farm is in water that is two to three feet deep and crops like cotton is completely damaged with cotton balls getting discoloured. The balls turned black and semi-red. Farmers fer that the yield may not be more than 5% even if they are able to get labour to pick the cotton balls.

Paddy farmers are making all out efforts to save the standing crop. They are trying to keep the plants standing and not allowing it to fall into in the standing water. A farmer in Venkatapur village in Sadashivpet mandal in the district, P. Venkata Reddy, who has sown paddy in two acres found the crop had fallen into the water due to the rains.

In an effort to save his crop he hired labour to tie up with strings bunches of five to 10 plants which would ensure that the plants remain standing and not soak in the water.

“This is the fine variety Telangana Sona rice. I had spent about ₹ 18,000 for two acres to save the crop. The paddy yield per acre is expected to be around 20 quintals which roughly would give me 10 quintals of rice after milling. In the open market the rice should fetch me around ₹4,000 per quintal and I should get a revenue of ₹ 80,000 if I spend this amount. Though this is an additional burden for me there is no other go. What else can we do?” asked Mr. Venkata Reddy.

For the first time in the district in more than a decade, two tanks — Devuni Cheruvu at Kandi and Mallepally tank — breached in the wee hours of Sunday.

According to sources, the bund of the tank breached between Mallepally and Charlagopularam at about 1 a.m. cutting off the road connecting the two villages.

Villagers alleged gross negligence of officials that led to the breach. They had lodged a complaint with the district authorities way back in November 2010 stating that the construction of the culvert at the tank disturbed the full tank level (FTL) and resulted in submergence of standing crops.

This was confirmed by the Irrigation department officials who inspected the tank and submitted a report in December same year suggesting changes to maintain the standard FTL.

“The HP culvert constructed to cross the Pedda Cheruvu at Malkapur village by the R&B department has disturbed the FTL of IB tank and causing damage to it as well as submerging standing crops,” read the report submitted on December 6, 2010, by the officials of the Irrigation department.

“We have made repeated appeals to the officials to address the issue but no action was taken so far in the name of law and order problem as some locals are opposing any alteration to the structure. But now, it has damaged crops and the tank breached,” P. Ravinder Reddy, one of the villagers, told The Hindu.

Meanwhile, MLA T. Jayaprakash Reddy visited the village and assured justice to villagers.

He said there was “a long way to go, a long political battle ahead”.

179,2020/10/19,Panthers Party too opposes amendments to Jammu & Kashmir Panchayati Raj Act,"It seems government wants to make way for outsiders to contest elections for local bodies, says Jammu-based party.

After facing criticism from the Valley-based regional parties, Jammu-based J&K National Panthers Party (NPP) also on Monday opposed the recent amendments made to the Panchayati Raj Act in the Union Territory (UT).

Terming the amendments ‘bizarre’, J&KNPP chairman Harsh Dev Singh said, “The modifications and the newly incorporated provisions in the Act would disempower the entire edifice of the existing panchayati raj and municipal structure in J&K”.

He said the matter could have been left to the J&K legislature for discussion, debate and necessary amendments, if needed. “The babus and clerks can’t be a substitute for duly elected legislature, which alone has the powers and prerogative to legislate in matters of public interest,” Mr. Singh said.

He said the elected chairmen of Block Development Councils (BDCs) and presidents of the municipal bodies “have been divested of their right to elect the chairman concerned of the district board”.

“By announcing to create 14 territorial constituencies in each district to elect new members of the newly proposed District Development Council, the government has sought to denigrate and downplay the role and significance of existing panchayats and BDCs,” he said.

He said the latest amendments have only added to the confusion. “It seems that the only objective of the government in bringing the amendment is to avoid Assembly elections and to further make way for outsiders to contest elections for local bodies in J&K .The doors had already been opened by the government for people from Bihar, U.P., Chhattisgarh, M.P. etc., who had obtained domicile certificates and thereby become eligible,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/panthers-party-too-opposes-amendments-to-jammu-kashmir-panchayati-raj-act/article32894691.ece

Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren on Monday said community transmission of coronavirus (COVID-19) may have taken place in the State.

Mr. Biren, who also holds the Health and Family Welfare portfolio, said, “Since I am not an expert I cannot say that there is now community transmission of COVID-19. However there is a general apprehension that it has already taken place as established by the growing reports of infections and deaths.”

Chief Secretary Rajesh Kumar has written to the Indian Council of Medical Research and other authorities on this issue. Manipur is also thinking about extending a complete lockdown.

The Chief Minister said: “There is a financial angle to the proposed extension of the complete lockdown in Manipur. Testing kits and others have to be bought by the State government now. ICMR has stopped free supply of testing kits to the States.”

He added that people were not following the safety rules and only if they did, the disease could be brought under control.

Mr. Biren said doctors, nurses and other paramedical staff were also getting infected.

Students’ protest

Six students organisations staged a sit-in in Imphal, demanding a state policy to handle the burgeoning threat of the COVID-19.

N. Edison, president of DESAM, a students’ organisation, said, “We had submitted a 12-point memorandum to the Chief Minister during a meeting on Sunday. We are demanding a State policy on how to tackle the COVID-19 infection. Five hundred beds should be set aside in a major hospital for the COVID-19 patients. Another 500-bedded hospital should also be opened.”

The agitating students are also demanding that the order deputing two IAS officers to supervise doctors should be withdrawn immediately.

There is also a growing concern among the people on the contradictory test results. Reports in the local media said that some persons who were certified as COVID-19 negative were later found to be positive.

The gang is allegedly operated by one Jayesh Patel, who is currently abroad since he fled the country in 2018. Out of those 14 persons who have been slapped with the GujCTOC, eight have already been arrested, while one was in jail.

“Five people including Jayesh Patel are at large and yet to be arrested,” said Jamnagar Superintendent of Police Deepan Bhadran, who was recently moved to Jamnagar after Jayesh Patel’s gang members became a major nuisance in the State.

Earlier, Mr. Bhadran was Deputy Commissioner of Police in the Ahmedabad crime branch.

While the kingpin of the gang, Jayesh Patel, is believed to be hiding in Dubai, the police have arrested eight of the 14 persons, including Atul Bhanderi, a sitting Bharatiya Janata Party Municipal Councillor of Jamnagar; Nilesh Toliya, a prominent builder; Vashram Miyatra, former Head Constable of the local crime branch; and Pravin Chovatiya, owner of a local newspaper.

Others arrested and booked were Mukesh Abangi; builder Jigar alias Jimmy Aalatiya; and their associates Anil Parmar and Praful Popat.

Another prime accused, Jaspal Jadeja, who was arrested earlier, was also booked under the GujCTOC.

Bhanderi is also accused in an offence of firing on a Professor of the Mahila College in November 2019, in a case of land grabbing.

In last few years, Jamnagar and its adjoining areas became “hot” places for extortion, land grabbing, encroachment, and forgery of land records and documents.

According to Mr. Bhadran, for the first time in Gujarat, a case has been registered under Section 4 of the GujCTOC, which pertains to possession of accountable property belonging to an organised crime syndicate.

He added that the police have filed half a dozen FIRs against the crime syndicate or gang operated by Jayesh Patel, who also figures in 41 other cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion, land and property grabbing, and cheating in Jamnagar, Ahmedabad and other places.

Now the police would move to trace, evaluate and seize the properties of all accused persons.

In 2018, a leading local lawyer Kirit Joshi was reportedly killed by Jayesh Patel gang members when Mr. Joshi was fighting as a lawyer in a disputed land matter worth ₹100 crore.

“The gang members would identify a parcel of land, create fake records and make bogus sale deeds. After that, the original owner of the land would be contacted for compromise and settle the matter by extracting huge money as extortion,” Rajkot range Deputy Inspector General of Police Sandeep Singh had told media persons on Friday.

Following dozens of complaints about land and property grabbing and extortion from local industrialists, traders and businessmen, a special team under SP Bhadran was formed to crack the whip.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gujarat-police-evoke-state-terror-law-against-gang/article32894286.ece

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president J.P. Nadda said on Monday that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act will be implemented and the process of framing rules is on.

“It is certain that you will get CAA. Because of coronavirus, the implementation of CAA got delayed. But as the situation is slowly improving, work has started and rules are now being framed,” Mr. Nadda said, while addressing party supporters at an event in Siliguri in the north Bengal.

The implementation of CAA has become a prominent political issue in the State with the ruling Trinamool Congress not only opposing it but hitting the streets in protest against the legislation.

The BJP president, who is visiting north Bengal, targeted the Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal, accusing it of indulging in a “divide and rule” policy. Mr. Nadda raised questions on non-implementation of two Central schemes — PM Kisan Samman Nidhi and Ayushman Bharat.

“Didi [Mamata Banerjee] says that these schemes won’t be implemented. I want to assure you that in April these schemes will be implemented,” Mr. Nadda said, referring to the Assembly elections scheduled in West Bengal next year.

The BJP president said that 8.6 lakh farmers had benefited from the PM Kisan scheme in the country, but the benefit could not reach 76 lakh farmers in West Bengal.

Mr. Nadda touched on several issues related to north Bengal, including the demand of for a separate State of Gorkhaland by the people of the Darjeeling hills. He reiterated the commitment to a “permanent political solution” to the people of Darjeeling hills and said that the BJP party manifesto for 2019 Lok Sabha polls also talks about it. He also assured Scheduled Tribe (ST) status to 11 hill communities.

The two States were asked to provide security to trucks and goods vehicles passing through the inter-State border so that supply of essentials was not blocked in Mizoram.

Assam has had a boundary dispute with Mizoram for decades and several rounds of talks have been held since 1994-95 to solve the issue. Till 1972, Mizoram was a part of Assam and acquired full statehood in 1987.

The 164.6 km-long border between the States runs along Cachar, Hailakandi and Karimganj districts in Assam and Kolasib, Mamit and Aizawl districts in Mizoram. There are several border areas where violence have been reported.

Saturday’s clashes were reported near Vairengte village in Kolasib district of Mizoram and Assam’s Lailapur in Cachar district. The Mizoram government claimed that some miscreants pelted stones at a group. A large number of persons gathered and set fire to about 20 temporary bamboo sheds said to be in Assam’s jurisdiction. Section 144 was imposed and a large number of security personnel were deployed in the area. Several persons were injured.

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal tweeted on Monday that he had apprised Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the present “Assam-Mizoram border situation over phone this afternoon.”

“I thank the Hon'ble PM for his support and assurance to solve the issue,” Mr. Sonowal said.

Assam’s Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) G.P Singh said no incident has been reported in the area since Saturday night.

“Situation is under control now. Movement of trucks has started, both States have been asked to provide security to trucks...as of now the road (highway) is open, there is no blockade,” Mr. Singh said.

The office of Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga tweeted, “ Hon'ble Home Minister @AmitShah, DoNER Minister @DrJitendraSingh, Home Secretary & others have telephoned HCM @ZoramthangaCM regarding the situation in Mizoram's border. They expressed support of the CM's wish for peaceful resolve of the situation.”

On Sunday, Mr. Zoramthanga had called an emergency Cabinet meet.

The National Commission for Women (NCW) on Monday sought an explanation from Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath for his “item” jibe against State Minister Imarti Devi.

The NCW has also forwarded the matter to the Election Commission for necessary action. “The Commission strongly condemns this irresponsible and disparaging statement made by the leader. The words used in the video are highly defamatory and shows disrespect towards the dignity of a woman,” the NCW said in a statement.

“At a time when we want more women to enter politics, such disrespectful remarks against a woman leader, that too from a person holding such a responsible position is very unfortunate,” it noted.

Addressing a poll meeting on Sunday in Gwalior’s Dabra town, where the BJP has fielded Imarti Devi, Mr. Nath said the Congress candidate was a “simple person” unlike the opponent who was an “item”.

Imarti Devi and 21 other MLAs loyal to Jyotiraditya Scindia had resigned from the Congress and the State Assembly and joined the BJP in March, in the process bringing down the Nath government.

The Bombay High Court on Monday asked the Mumbai Police to issue summons to Republic TV chief Arnab Goswami, if he is proposed to be added as an accused in the FIR in the TRP (Television Rating Point) manipulation case.

Also read: Fake TRP case | Republic TV, Arnab Goswamy move Bombay High Court to quash FIR

A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and M.S. Karnik was hearing a criminal petition filed by ARG Outlier Media Private Limited and Mr. Goswami, who is the managing director and editor-in-chief of Republic Media Network. The plea seeks to quash the FIR registered by Kandivali Police Station against them on October 6. The charges have been made under Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing on behalf of Mr. Goswami, argued that Mumbai Police had mala fide interest, that they might arrest Mr. Goswami, and sought interim protection from arrest. To which the court said it could not pass that order as Mr. Goswami had not been named as an accused.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing the Maharashtra government and Mumbai Police, said summons would be issued to Mr. Goswami. However, he [Mr. Sibal] could not commit on Mr. Goswami not being arrested.

While perusing the FIR, the court said, “It is not an encyclopedia. We would like to peruse the investigation papers and see what probe has been done from today till the next date of hearing.

The court added, “In case the Investigating Officer proposes to name Mr. Goswami as accused in the case, then, as done with the eight persons, summons shall be issued to him and he shall then cooperate with the police.”

The court also raised questions on whether it was correct on the part of the Commissioner of Police Param Bir Singh to hold press conferences in such matters.

The Bench said, “We don’t know if it is the correct method or procedure to give interviews to the media. We are not talking about just this matter but many sensitive cases...we find police giving information to the media even when investigation is in progress. Police are not supposed to reveal incriminating information pertaining to the case.”

Mr. Sibal agreed to this and said the petitioner channel should assure the court it would not indulge in the vilification of the police and conduct a media trial.

Justice Shinde then said, “Media is considered as the fourth pillar of democracy and, hence, they too need to behave responsibly.”

The court directed the Mumbai Police to produce papers of the investigation in a sealed cover on November 4, and said it would hear the matter on November 5.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a82b0q/article31790525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BMARNAB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/trp-case-issue-summons-to-arnab-goswami-before-arraignment-says-bombay-high-court/article32892651.ece
189,2020/10/19,It’s up to BJP’s Khadse to decide on joining NCP: Pawar,"But any decision to change parties must be his alone, says NCP chief

Commenting on the widespread speculation of estranged senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse defecting to his party, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said that while Mr. Khadse's contribution to establishing the BJP in Maharashtra was immense, it was ultimately up to him to take a decision whether or not to join the NCP or any other party in the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi government.

Mr. Pawar went on to say that Mr. Khadse was regarded as the most influential Opposition leader in the State in the last 25 years.

“Whether as Leader of the Opposition [in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly] or as the former State Revenue Minister, we have seen Mr. Khadse’s accomplishments and his contribution and are well aware of his capabilities. However, any political decision that he wishes to take [possible defection] is ultimately up to him,” said Mr. Pawar in Osmanabad.

While remaining ostensibly non-committal about Mr. Khadse’s entry into the NCP fold, Mr. Pawar nevertheless dropped subtle hints in his pointed remarks.

‘Influential Opposition leader’

“Despite being considered an influential Opposition leader in Maharashtra’s politics for more than two decades, Mr. Khadse has not been given his due. As his contribution has passed unnoticed, he may be considering joining a particular party where his work will be recognized. So, if he believes in our party [NCP], then nothing can be done [stopping him from entering the NCP],” he stated.

A little over a week ago, Shiv Sena leader and Minister Gulabrao Patil claimed that Mr. Khadse would be changing his political colours soon and made the remark that he was not aware of which party the BJP leader would eventually join nor of whom he was in touch with.

Shiv Sena’s attempts

Since the past few days, rumours have been swirling thick and fast that Mr. Khadse would be entering the NCP fold. Shiv Sena leaders like Abdul Sattar, Uday Samant and Mr. Patil have been actively courting Mr. Khadse, a stalwart leader from north Maharashtra, to join their party.

After being denied a ticket in the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly polls and following the defeat of his daughter, Rohini Khadse, in the election, Mr. Khadse has been vocal about his disenchantment with his party.

Since the conclusion of the Assembly polls, a major schism has emerged within the Maharashtra BJP leadership with the top brass fearing a possible intra-party revolt by its notable OBC leaders led by Mr. Khadse, former Ministers Pankaja Munde and Prakash Mehta and other leaders who were either denied ticket or suffered upset defeats in the election.

Upset wit Fadnavis

Mr. Khadse was reportedly upset with the then Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, the BJP’s leader in the State, for the latter’s ‘authoritarian style’ of running the party and eliminating his potential ‘rivals’ in a ‘Machiavellian fashion’.

At the time, the OBC leaders blamed Mr. Fadnavis for engineering their defeats and denying them ticket.

Mr. Khadse has consistently maintained that there had been a ‘conspiracy’ by certain leaders in the State BJP unit to ensure the defeats of Ms. Munde and his daughter, and that the move was aimed at finishing off his political career.

Since then, rumours have been circulating of his potential defection to either the Sena or the NCP.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/its-up-to-bjps-khadse-to-decide-on-joining-ncp-pawar/article32892001.ece

MLA Vijay Mishra of Bhadohi and his son have been charged with raping a Varanasi-based singer, said police.

The four-time MLA, who was elected to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly on a Nishad Party ticket in 2017, was in August arrested for allegedly grabbing a relative's house and extorting money from him. He was then detained from Agar Malwa of Madhya Pradesh a day after he released a video on social media expressing a fear that he “could be murdered” or arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police any day.

In a fresh trouble for him, a case under gang rape, wrongful confinement and criminal intimidation was lodged at the Gopiganj police station in Bhadohi against him, his son Vishnu Mishra and another accused, Vikash Mishra, said police.

In her police complaint, the woman has accused the MLA of sexually exploiting her since 2014.

At gunpoint

Superintendent of Police Bhadohi Ram Badan Singh said the complainant alleged that during the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Mr. Mishra invited her to perform at a programme. When she was changing in the changing room, the MLA barged in, held her hostage at gunpoint and raped her, the SP said referring to the complaint.

The woman also alleged that the MLA’s son and his friend later raped her in a car. From 2014, they continued to sexually exploit her and harass her and even called her to locations in Prayagraj and Varanasi under the pretext of offering her a job, said the SP.

The MLA would also video call her and get nude while doing so, said the SP.

The Supreme Court on Monday asked a gurudwara management to approach the Maharashtra State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) for permission to hold Dusshera procession amid COVID-19 pandemic.

A Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao, which assembled despite the court being on vacation, said the SDMA would have to take a decision about the process based on the ground situation.

The court, however, gave the gurudwara management liberty to move the Bombay High Court in case of grievance caused by the SDMA decision.

The National Conference (NC) on Monday said the BJP had “resorted to employing its agencies for the task, after failing to politically fight party president Dr. Farooq Abdullah”.

“The Enforcement Directorate’s summons to Dr. Abdullah is clearly the result of the unity that Dr. Sahib has been able to forge among mainstream political parties in J&K. This is the price one faces when opposed to BJP’s ideology and divisive politics,“ a NC spokesman said in a statement.

He charged the recent history was witness to how BJP had been employing “coercion and intimidation” through various departments to target the Opposition leaders across the country. “The recent ED summons to Dr. Farooq Abdullah is a case in point. Dr. Abdullah continues to maintain his innocence and will cooperate with the authorities in what is nothing but a witch-hunt,” he added.

The NC spokesman said the timing of ED move was “very clear”.

“His previous summons were just before the Aug. 5 last year and today’s summons comes within days of forming the People’s Alliance for the Gupkar Declaration, of which Dr. Farooq Abdullah has taken a lead,” the spokesman said.

Political vendetta: Omar

NC vice-president Omar Abdullah also tweeted on the issue: “The party will be responding to this ED summons shortly. This is nothing less than political vendetta coming days after the formation of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration. To set the record straight no raids are being conducted at Dr. Sahib’s residence.”

The People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration is an amalgam of around six political parties, which pledged to fight for restoration of J&K’s special status, abrogated by the Centre on August 5 last year.

The CBI had filed a charge sheet against Dr. Abdullah as the then association president, former JKCA general secretary Saleem Khan, treasurer Ahsan Ahmad Mirza and senior J&K Bank executive Bashir Ahmad Misgar.

In September 2019, the ED arrested Mr. Mirza under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act after he could not explain the transaction that were under scrutiny. He was the authorised signatory in the bank accounts of the JKCA from 2004 till March 2012.

It was alleged that between 2002 and 2011, the Board of Control for Cricket in India granted ₹112 crore to the JKCA for infrastructure development and promotion of cricket. However, funds to the tune of ₹43.69 crore were allegedly diverted.

Attachment of assets

Based on the findings, in February last, the ED attached assets worth ₹2.60 crore, including a shopping complex in Srinagar, linked to Mr. Mirza and one Mir Manzoor Gazanffer, who was a member of the finance committee of the JKCA from 2006 and 2009.

The ED alleged that funds from the BCCI were received in three different bank accounts of the association. However, several other accounts were opened in its name and the money was transferred further. Mr. Mirza also allegedly diverted huge amounts to the account of his company, Mirza Sons.

From the laundered funds, ₹1.31 crore was received by Mr. Gazanffer, who was part of the finance committee “arbitrarily constituted” by Dr. Abdullah as the association president, the ED has earlier alleged.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dwlm60/article32478796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FAROOQABDULLAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ed-questions-farooq-abdullah-in-jammu-kashmir-cricket-association-case/article32890966.ece
195,2020/10/19,"Will observe two-hour silence to atone for Kamal Nath’s ‘indecent remarks’ against woman Minister, says Shivraj Singh Chouhan","The former Chief Minister allegedly made the remarks against Women and Child Development Minister Imarti Devi at a public meeting in Gwalior district on Sunday

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday hit out at Congress leader Kamal Nath for making “indecent remarks” against a woman Minister at a public meeting by pointing out he had no regrets.

Stating the remarks were made against the Dalit Minister born in a poor family, Mr. Chouhan told reporters, “Shamelessly, he is trying to justify them. I am upset about it. Whether he atones for it or not, I will atone for it and observe a two-hour silence with the resolve that respect for mothers, sisters and daughters will be kept in Madhya Pradesh and we will work for their welfare dedicatedly.”

At a public meeting in Dabra in Gwalior district on Sunday to canvass for Congressman Suresh Kumar Raje, Mr. Nath said, “Our candidate is of simple nature. He is not like her. What is her name?” When the gathering named Imarti Devi, the former Chief Minister continued: “Why should I take her name? You know her better than I do. You should have warned me before what item she is.”

Appeal to Sonia Gandhi

“In Madhya Pradesh, we talk about women empowerment,” Women and Child Development Minister Imarti Devi, a supporter of Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia who switched over from the Congress in March, told reporters on Sunday night. “Today, he (Mr. Nath) has abused all Lakshmis of Madhya Pradesh. I appeal to Sonia Gandhi to remove him from the party.”

Meanwhile, the BJP has appealed to the State Chief Electoral Officer to act against Mr. Nath for his remarks which reportedly violated the Model Code of Conduct as well as insulted women and Scheduled Castes.

Apologise publicly: Mayawati

Calling upon the Congress to apologise publicly, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati wrote on Twitter, “In order to teach the Congress a lesson for this and stop the disrespect of women, I appeal especially to those belonging to Dalit communities to vote for the BSP in the 28 Assembly seats.”

False complaints: Cong.

Claiming the video clip of Mr. Nath’s remark, which had gone viral on the social media, was pulled out of context, State Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja said, “Mr. Nath didn’t mention anyone’s name. And anyway, ‘item’ can mean different things. The BJP is only filing false complaints before the Election Commission, and trying to defame their own woman leader.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/k2vs2d/article32890658.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/shivraj-singh-chouhanjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/will-observe-two-hour-silence-to-atone-for-kamal-naths-indecent-remarks-against-woman-minister-says-shivraj-singh-chouhan/article32890580.ece
196,2020/10/19,Mizoram revokes prohibitory order from area along Tripura border,"The order was revoked as the proposed construction of a Shiv temple at Thaidawr Tlang has been called off by ’Songrongma’, an organisation of Tripura.

Mizoram on Sunday revoked the prohibitory order imposed in Phuldungsei Zampui and Zomuantlang villages near its border with Tripura after an indigenous organisation from the neighbouring State called off the proposed construction of a temple in the area, officials said.

The Tripura government had also asked Mizoram to revoke it, claiming that the disputed areas are in the North Tripura district, officials of the two States said.

The Mizoram government said that the prohibitory order issued under section 144 of the CrPC on October 16 stands revoked with immediate effect as the proposed construction of a Shiv temple at Thaidawr Tlang has been called off by ’Songrongma’, an organisation of Tripura.

On Friday, Mizorams Mamit district deputy commissioner Lalrozama issued the prohibitory order, restricting assembly of five or more people in the village and surrounding areas of Phuldungsei Zampui and Zomuantlang to prevent any untoward incident.

The order had said that ‘Songrongma’ was “intending” to construct the temple at Thaidawn Tlang, which is located within the Mamit district, on October 19 and 20.

Any activity on the inter-State border is likely to disrupt or adversely affect peace and tranquility in the region, the order had said.

In a letter written to Mizoram deputy secretary of home David H Lalthangliana on Saturday, Tripura governments additional secretary A.K. Bhattacharya said the prohibitory order was “erroneous” and “highly objectionable“.

It said that Mizoram’s Mamit district administration had erroneously mentioned Betlingchhip, also known as Thaidawr Tlang, which is currently in the Tripura government’s jurisdiction.

Bhattacharya urged the Mamit district administration to rectify and immediately withdraw the prohibitory order.

He further said that the Tripura government has constructed a watchtower at the peak of Betlingchhip and the Mamit district administration in the order has erroneously included Phuldungsei para/village under Sabual VC of Jampui Hills RD Block in Kanchanpur sub-division of the North Tripura district.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mizoram-revokes-prohibitory-order-from-area-along-tripura-border/article32890132.ece

198,2020/10/19,Tension at Assam-Mizoram border after clash,"Several people from both States injured in violence, situation under control in the area, say officials

Tension prevailed on the Assam-Mizoram border after a violent clash took place between the people of the two States, injuring several, officials said on Sunday.

The situation is now under control in the area, which is on the border between the Kolasib district of Mizoram and Cachar district of Assam, they said.

A meeting, chaired by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, between the two States will be held on Monday to take stock of the situation, Mizoram Home Minister Lalchamliana said. The Chief Secretaries of the two States will be present in the meeting, he said.

PMO informed

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said he has apprised the Prime Minister’s Office and Union Home Ministry of the prevailing situation in the area. Mr. Sonowal also telephoned Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga and spoke to him on the border incident, stressing on the need to take productive measures and joint efforts to address the border issues.

Mr. Zoramthanga assured Mr. Sonowal of efforts to maintain peace at the inter-State border and cooperation, the Assam government said in a statement.

The two States have deployed security personnel, including those of the Indian Reserve Battalion, in the violence-hit areas near the Vairengte village in Mizoram and Assam’s Lailapur, officials said.

Vairengte in Kolasib district is on the northern fringe of Mizoram through which the National Highway-306 (formerly 54) passes, linking the State to Assam. The nearest village in Assam is Lailapur, which is in Cachar district.

Kolasib Deputy Commissioner H. Lalthlangliana said a large number of Vairengte residents assembled when some people from Assam, armed with sticks and dao, pelted stones at a group near the auto-rickshaw stand on the outskirts of the border village on Saturday evening.

The mob from Vairengte retaliated and set on fire about 20 temporary bamboo huts and stalls built along the National Highway by residents of Lailapur despite a prohibitory order being in place, he said.

One of the injured persons, who suffered a cut in his neck, was admitted to the Kolasib district hospital and his condition was critical. Three people were being treated at a Public Health Centre in Vairengte, he said.

The incident could be the fallout of the demolition of a makeshift hut used by local volunteers who guard the inter-State border near the Saihaipui ‘V’ village, about 3 km from Vairengte, he said.

The volunteers are guarding the border to check the movement of the people in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Defusing tension

Mr. Lalthlangliana said no one died in the clash and one person from Assam was admitted at Silchar Medical College and Hospital. He said that he has spoken to Cachar Deputy Commissioner Keerthi Jalli and asked her to take measures to ensure that the National Highway, which has been blocked by the local people, is cleared at the earliest.

The Assam government also said that the situation is under control and senior officials along with police are in the area to defuse the tension.

State Forest Minister Parimal Shuklabaidya, on the direction of Mr. Sonowal, visited Lailapur during the day and interacted with the people.

The incident was the handiwork of miscreants to create disturbance in the community, a statement issued by the Assam government quoted him as saying.

Mr. Zoramthanga also held a Cabinet meeting during the day. “I sincerely request everyone to maintain peace and to kindly not bypass any administrative proceedings,” he tweeted.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Home Minister Lalchamliana said the Mizoram government has urged Assam to make efforts to defuse the tension and restore peace and tranquillity in the area.

Recent troubles

He alleged that recently troubles were created by Assam at three border points — Thinghlun in Mamit district, and Saihapui ‘V’ and Vairengte, both in Kolasib. “We have approached the Centre over the border dispute. Accordingly, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla will hold a virtual meeting with Chief Secretaries of the two States on Monday,” he said.

At least seven people from Mizoram were injured in the clash on Saturday night, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ud0ywy/article32888309.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE18SONOWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tension-at-assam-mizoram-border-after-clash/article32888313.ece

A 13-year-old boy kidnapped three days ago from Madhya Pradesh’s Jabalpur district for a ransom of ₹2 crore was found dead on Sunday, police said.

The boy was murdered and three persons, who committed the crime despite receiving ₹8 lakh ransom from his family, have been arrested, police said.

The accused possibly killed the minor as the victim had recognised one of them as an acquaintance of his father, they said.

“The body of the boy, who was the son of a local transporter, was found floating in Bargi dam canal near Bichua village, located around 20 km from here,” city Superintendent of Police Alok Sharma said.

A piece of cloth was found wrapped around the boy’s neck, he said.

‘Victim strangulated’

“It is suspected that the boy was strangulated with a piece of cloth before the body was dumped into the canal,” the officer said.

The victim was kidnapped from Dhanvantari Nagar area here on Thursday when he went to buy some items from a shop near his home, he said.

Later, his mother and father got ransom calls for ₹2 crore and the callers warned them not to approach police, he added.

Superintendent of Police Sidharth Bahuguna said Rahul alias Monu Vishwakarma (30), whom the child recognised as his father’s acquaintance, Malay Rai (25) and Karan Jaggi (24) were arrested for the crime.

200,2020/10/19,Amarinder should resign immediately: Akali Dal,"Law of the jungle in Punjab, says party

While the police are yet to make any arrests in the killing of Shaurya Chakra awardee Balwinder Singh Sandhu, the Opposition has hit out at the ruling Congress government, asking Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to take moral responsibility for the breakdown in the law and order situation in the State and resign immediately.

‘Rampant killings’

Former Minister and Shiromani Akali Dal leader Daljit Cheema in a statement, said, “It seems there is a law of the jungle in Punjab. We are witnessing rampant killings and armed dacoities. A Shaurya Chakra awardee — Balwinder Singh Sandhu — was murdered at his native village Bhikhiwind, a few days after his security detail was withdrawn. Not only this, there have been at least three incident of killing in one week in the area under the Bhikhiwind police station alone.”

Call for action

Calling for an immediate course correction, Mr. Cheema said if the law and order situation was not brought under control immediately and peace and communal harmony was not restored there was likelihood of Punjab becoming a disturbed State yet again.

Balwinder Sandhu, who had fought against terrorism in Punjab for years, was shot dead on October 16 by unidentified assailants at his native Bhikhiwind village in Tarn Taran district.

Ahead of the two-day special session of the Punjab Assembly, beginning October 19, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday said views of the MLAs would be taken into account while finalising the strategy to battle the Centre’s farm laws, in consultation with legal and independent experts.

The Opposition parties — Aam Aadmi Party and Shiromani Akali Dal — however, questioned the State government’s alleged “secrecy” surrounding the proposed agenda.

“This fight will go on, we will take the fight to the Supreme Court,” Captain Amarinder said at a meeting of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP). He said the whole world was watching Punjab with a lot of expectation and the views of the MLAs were extremely important for drafting a comprehensive strategy to protect the State’s farmers and agriculture.

‘Clear stand’

He said for the Congress, the fight was not about politics but to save the State’s farmers and decision will be taken in the interest of the farming community. Taking a dig at the Akalis, the Chief Minister said the Congress was not double-faced and had a clear stand on the issue of the farm laws.

Extend session: AAP

AAP has demanded an extension to the proposed one-day special session to at least seven days to discuss and debate threadbare the implications of the farm laws. A delegation of the party, led by Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, met Assembly Speaker Rana K.P. Singh and submitted a memorandum flagging certain core issues of concern.

“Barely a few hours were left for the special session to commence, neither the Punjab government nor the Vidhan Sabha secretariat had informed the principal opposition party about the detailed agenda to be put across in the Vidhan Sabha,” he said.

‘Fool-proof legislation’

The SAD asked the Chief Minister to come out with a fool-proof legislation so that the rights of the farmers were secured in perpetuity.

SAD leaders Sharanjit Singh Dhillon and Bikram Singh Majithia said there were already apprehensions that the Congress was hand-in- glove with the Modi government and had purposely not taken all stakeholders into confidence so that no effective step was taken to stymie the implementation of the Central laws in Punjab.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ivrgvu/article32888130.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE18-AMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fight-will-go-on-against-centres-agriculture-laws-says-punjab-cm/article32888131.ece
202,2020/10/19,NHRC warns Odisha officials in wrong blood transfusion case,"‘Despite directions, no reports provided by Health Secretary’

The National Human Rights Commission has issued a warning to the Odisha Health Secretary for personal appearance as the State government failed to submit its response in the case of transfusion of HIV-infected blood in a government-run hospital.

Human rights activist Radhakanta Tripathy had moved the NHRC highlighting that two elderly patients were transfused with HIV and hepatitis inflected blood in Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Science and Research (VIMSAR), Burla, in 2016.

As the alleged negligence of doctors had put the life of two patients in grave danger, Mr. Tripathy sought an independent probe into both the cases and punitive action. He had also requested the NHRC to award a hefty compensation to both the patients.

A 70-year-old person hailing from Rairakhol was admitted to the surgery ward of VIMSAR on June 9, 2016. He had undergone operation on June 13, 2016. Due to non-availability of blood units, a relative’s blood was transfused. Later, tests revealed that it was HIV infected.

Infected blood

Similarly, a 60-year-old person of Brajarajnagar was admitted to the hospital on June 12, 2016 for a leg surgery. After blood transfusion, it was revealed that the blood was hepatitis-infected.

The NHRC noted that despite its directions, no reports were provided by the Chief Secretary and the Health Secretary, and the government through a lower-rung officers sought additional two months’ time to respond.

The Commission directed its registry to send a copy of the proceedings to the authorities concerned for filing requisite reports within six weeks. “The Chief Secretary has not submitted the requisite reply. Further, the Health Secretary has also not submitted the status of the departmental action taken against the delinquent officers along with the status of condition of the two patients so far,” the apex rights body pointed out.

The Commission has issued a fresh show-cause notice to the Odisha Chief Secretary as to why it should not grant a monetary compensation of ₹1 lakh each to next of kin of the two victims in six weeks positively.

‘Issue reminder’

“Issue reminder to the State Health Secretary to submit the requisite report regarding departmental action taken against the delinquent officers within the said period failing which the Commission may invoke coercive process u/s 13 of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 for personal appearance of the authority concerned,” the NHRC order says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nhrc-warns-odisha-officials-in-wrong-blood-transfusion-case/article32888118.ece

205,2020/10/19,Organisations call for transparency in working conditions in textile mills,"The Tamil Nadu Alliance, a coalition of civil society networks working in the area of textiles in the State, has called upon textile brands and retailers to sign a declaration that will improve the working condition of labourers in textile mills in the State.

The Alliance, which was established in 2017, represents over 100 grassroot organisations.

According to a press release, it called on brands and retailers to do more to abolish exploitative working conditions within textile mills in Tamil Nadu. International brands and retailers that source yarn and fabric from the textile units here should take steps to address “severe exploitation in their textile supply chain.”

With more than 2,000 mills employing approximately 2.8 lakh workers, spinning units in the State are a vital source of jobs. “Yet, for many years, civil society groups have documented exploitative practices occurring within textile spinning mills in Tamil Nadu. Excessive and involuntary overtime, extremely low wages, physical and sexual violence and restriction of freedom of movement – many of which are indicators of forced labour - are known to occur in some parts of the industry,” said a press release from the Alliance.

“To date, there has been limited action by international brands and retailers to identify and address rights violations like these that are taking place beyond tier-one of their supply chain. A widespread lack of transparency and visibility of conditions in textile processing and manufacturing sites has hindered civil society efforts to work with brands to improve the situation of workers in the industry,” it added.

The Tamil Nadu Declaration, developed by the Alliance, highlights the need for sustained action by brands and retailers to address exploitative practices in textile spinning mills.

It urged the retailers and brands to expand supply chain transparency to all textile manufacturing facilities, support the effective implementation of labour laws and protections in Tamil Nadu, adopt sustainable sourcing and purchasing models that promote decent working conditions throughout the supply chain, integrate worker-driven approaches to monitor compliance with labour standards and support the development of a collective grievance mechanism in the State.

As textile production resumes in the wake of COVID-19, workers are more vulnerable to exploitative practices, including forced labour. “Through the Declaration we are calling on brands to work with us as the Tamil Nadu Alliance to build a stronger, more sustainable textile sector. Collaborative action between business and grassroots civil society is essential to support the industry to ensure the effective protection of textile workers’ rights,” the Alliance said in the press release.

Tamil Nadu Alliance in partnership with the Freedom Fund and Fashion Revolution, has reached out to more than 60 international brands and retailers sourcing from textile mills in Tamil Nadu to encourage them to sign up to the Declaration.

As a first step, it asked signatory brands to publicly disclose a list of textile manufacturing sites in the supply chain and support policy implementation efforts to protect mill workers rights. A list of companies that sign the Declaration will be published soon on the Tamil Nadu Declaration website, the Alliance said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/organisations-call-for-transparency-in-working-conditions-in-textile-mills/article32895680.ece

C. Ayyasamy (28), a visually challenged person from Chadivayalpathi, was working as announcer at the Kovai Courtallam, a popular tourism spot in the district. With the eco-tourism centre closed to visitors due to COVID-19 pandemic, he is forced to do other jobs to run his family.

Mr. Ayyasamy is one of the many tribal people from Coimbatore district whose meagre income from working in eco-tourism centres has been affected since March.

“Like many, I was jobless for some months. When the lockdown was eased, people started coming to the Kovai Courtallam. So I was assigned at the Forest Department check post on the way to the tourism spot to give announcements to send back visitors,” he said.

Around 60 people from nearby tribal settlements were involved in various works at Kovai Courtallam before it was closed to visitors. They also ran seven shops that sold eatables to the visitors.

Now only around 20 men, who were jobless, are employed at the Chadivayal elephant camp for maintenance works.

On an average, Kovai Courtallam saw 1,500 to 2,000 visitors on weekends and a crowd varying between 200 and 400 during weekdays.

Kovai Courtallam near Siruvani, Baralikadu near Karamadai, both in Combatore Forest Division, and Top Slip within the limits of Ulandi forest range of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve are the three main eco-tourism centres in the district where tribal people are engaged in various activities, including sales of forest produces.

The situation is not different at Baralikadu where around 50 tribal people were working.

“A total of 35 men were working at the boat house. Remaining were women who were involved in preparing food to visitors. With the tourism spot remaining closed, these people have shifted to other works including farming,” said V. Raman, head of the tribal people at the boat house.

Around 300 people used to visit Baralikadu eco-tourism centre on Saturdays and Sundays.

According to V.S. Paramasivam, Coimbatore district president of Tamil Nadu Tribal Association, around 40 tribal people who were working at Top Slip, mostly women, are now jobless.

“These women used to run their families with the meagre income of ₹ 5,000 to ₹ 6,000 they used to earn a month. Now they are living with the provisions given through ration shops, which are inadequate,” he said.

211,2020/10/19,Four government schools get renovated play areas,"A project by the district administration to renovate the play areas of four government schools in Dharapuram taluk has been completed recently.

Dharapuram Sub-Collector Pavankumar G. Giriyappanavar said on Monday that the four schools were Government Higher Secondary School, Sankarandampalayam; Government Middle School, Thalakkarai; Government Middle School, Nallimadam; and Government Middle School, Dharapuram. The project done in collaboration with Anthill Creations, a Bengaluru-based organisation, focused on building playscapes for children and was funded through the corporate social responsibility (CSR) fund of Power Grid Corporation of India.

Apart from beautification of the play areas of the schools, Mr. Giriyappanavar said that the initiative is also aimed at increasing the enrolment of students in the coming academic years. “We felt that this will be one more reason for the students to come to school,” he told The Hindu.

The works began in January after securing the funding of about ₹10 lakh and getting the approval from District Collector K. Vijayakarthikeyan. Initially scheduled for completion by May, the project was delayed due to the COVID-19 lockdown and was finally completed by the first week of October, according to Mr. Giriyappanavar.

The play areas in the schools have unique playing set-ups such as heaving hoops, four-way seesaws and double-tyre climbers.

According to Mayukh Deb, Business Development Manager of Anthill Creations, the playground equipment were constructed out of recycled materials such as used tyres, which are painted in bright colours to make them more attractive for the students. “Many children do not have a proper play area (in schools),” he said. The organisation, founded by graduates of Indian Institute of Technology – Kharagpur, have so far built over 250 play areas across the country and stresses on children’s “right to play,” Mr. Deb said.

According to Medical Superintendent P.V. Dhanapal, as on Sunday, 293 patients were undergoing treatment for COVID-19 and of those 147 had co-morbid conditions.

Dr. Balajinathan said that the positivity rate has also reduced to 4% at the hospital and among the RT-PCR samples tested within 24 hours on Saturday, only 70 tested positive.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/i4cjqz/article32888026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA19OXYGEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/salem-gh-registers-decline-in-covid-19-deaths/article32888027.ece
229,2020/10/19,"Maharashtra rain: Centre must step in to help farmers, says Pawar","NCP chief along with other MPs from State to meet Modi soon

As heavy showers induced by the retreating monsoon continue to batter Maharashtra, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday said that while the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government would do everything in power to help farmers, the Centre must step in to help as well.

Mr. Pawar, who commenced his two-day tour of the rain-hit districts in the Marathwada region on Sunday, further said that he, along with other MPs from Maharashtra, would be going to Delhi in the next 8-10 days to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and seek financial assistance for the afflicted farmers.

“Croplands have suffered tremendous damage as a result of the excess rain…While sugarcane, paddy, tur, and soybean crops have been destroyed, in some cases, the agricultural soil has been washed away. It is not possible for farmers to recoup losses of such magnitude in a short time. So, while the State is firmly behind the farmers in this grave hour, there are some limitations to the assistance it can give,” the NCP chief said in Osmanabad district.

The solution to this crisis must be jointly sought by the State and the Centre, said Mr. Pawar, former Union Agriculture Minister.

Earlier, Mr. Pawar met farmers in some of the worst-hit villages of Osmanabad’s Lohara tehsil, while surveying the damage to their crops by incessant rain that have been pelting Marathwada for the last one week.

Consoling the farmers, the NCP chief, reminded villagers of the destruction and loss of life suffered during the 1993 earthquake in Marathwada. “We got through that terrible crisis [1993 earthquake] and we will come through this present calamity as well,” Mr. Pawar said.

In the political race to lend succour to Maharashtra’s farmers, the 79-year-old Mr. Pawar has yet again stolen a march over both Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray — his coalition partner in the MVA — as well as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis by beginning his tour ahead of them.

Mr. Thackeray and Mr. Fadnavis will begin their respective tours in Solapur and Baramati (Mr. Pawar’s bastion) on Monday. Mr. Pawar’s visit to Osmanabad on Sunday is also noteworthy for the fact that it marks exactly a year when he delivered a much-publicised, eye-catching pre-election speech in Satara amid rain.

The Maratha strongman’s speech became a visual shorthand for the Opposition’s fight against the BJP in the Maharashtra Assembly polls, and did much to rally public opinion behind the NCP in the final results.

Meanwhile, the BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP, Chhatrapati Sambhajiraje, too visited Osmanabad on Sunday.

Speaking at Tamalwadi in Tuljapur, Mr. Sambhajiraje urged the CM to leave every other work and focus only on alleviating the plight of the farmers.

“Farmers are in dire straits as the rain has destroyed their kharif crops. The rabi sowing season is in great peril as well owing to the condition of their water-logged fields. I urge the State government to declare immediate cash benefits of ₹50,000 per hectare for every afflicted farmer. I will soon be meeting Mr. Thackeray and submit a detailed report,” he said.

Authorities estimate that the retreating monsoon has destroyed more than seven lakh hectares of harvest-ready crops in districts in western Maharashtra and Marathwada, with Solapur, Osmanabad and Latur ranking as the worst-hit.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kudeoe/article32615527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BMPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/maharashtra-rain-centre-must-step-in-to-help-farmers-says-pawar/article32888812.ece

231,2020/10/19,Indian Premier League 2020 | It feels good but it’s just a number: Dhoni,"Match No. 200 for the CSK skipper

Chennai Super Kings’ match against Rajasthan Royals on Monday marked the 200th appearance of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the IPL but, as is his wont, the skipper said he was oblivious to it and played down the milestone.

“You spoke about it and that’s how I got to know,” CSK skipper Dhoni told presenter Danny Morrison at the toss.

“It feels good but at the same time it’s just a number. I feel fortunate to play for such a long time without many injuries.”

Captain since inception

Dhoni has been the captain of three-time champion side since the IPL’s inception in 2008. When the franchise was suspended for two years, the veteran represented Rising Pune Supergiant.

Earlier this month, he had overtaken Suresh Raina (194 games) to become the player with most appearances.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/aaq1z2/article32895156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th20dhoni1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-it-feels-good-but-its-just-a-number-dhoni/article32895157.ece
232,2020/10/19,Indian Premier League 2020 | Missed Bhuvi: Murali,"‘Bowlers did their job, batsmen have to step up’

Sunrisers Hyderabad bowling coach Muttiah Muralitharan said on Sunday, after his team lost to Kolkata Knight Riders in the Super Over, that Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s absence was felt.

But, he didn’t want to find fault with the bowling attack.

“They have been doing a good job restricting teams to below 160,” he said.

“It is in batting that we are lacking. We can click and still have a chance, for it is a matter of winning three or four games to qualify for the play-offs,” Murali said in the post-match briefing.

He said SRH preferred Kane Williamson as opener because of his injury as he was finding it difficult to run twos and threes.

“We wanted Kane to use the PowerPlay and put up a good total. He did his job,” Murali said.

“There is nothing wrong with the pitch. The pressure levels were different, chasing is always difficult,” Murali said. “

Didn’t rebuild

Fergusson bowled well to pick up those wickets and we didn’t rebuild the innings after that,” he said.

“I repeat, it is all about winning one game and getting back the momentum as this time one team with seven wins will make it and our net run-rate should come in handy,” Murali concluded.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/xkky0p/article32895120.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20MURALI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-missed-bhuvi-murali/article32895121.ece
233,2020/10/19,"Indian Premier League 2020: CSK vs RR | Royals trounce Super Kings, rise above bottom-half logjam","Buttler drives 126-run chase after loss of early wickets to lift side to fifth; Dhoni’s men fail to force the pace, especially against the leg-spinners

Jos Buttler slammed an unbeaten 70 off just 48 balls (7x4, 2x6) to guide Rajasthan Royals to a comprehensive seven-wicket win over Chennai Super Kings at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Monday.

Chasing a modest target of 126, RR was struggling at 28 for three before Buttler and Steve Smith (28 n.o., 34b, 2x4) took charge and sealed victory with 2.3 overs to spare.

RR’s fourth win in 10 games keeps its hopes of a playoff spot alive. CSK’s seventh defeat means its chances are remote.

Walking in at five, Buttler slowly but steadily took control of the chase and was able to find the boundary when needed while Smith was happy to play second fiddle in their unbeaten 98-run stand for the third wicket.

The Englishman started with a reverse sweep off Ravindra Jadeja before he attacked the CSK medium-pacers with his powerful shots down the ground as he got his eye in.

In the 12th over, Buttler hit Shardul Thakur for a four over point and followed it with a six over long-off to switch gears.

Facing Buttler’s fury

Piyush Chawla faced the fury of Buttler’s willow in the 15th over, going for three consecutive boundaries, the first of which brought up the batsman’s half-century.

CSK relied more on its pacers than spinners, with Chawla being introduced only in the 13th over.

In contrast, the RR bowling effort was led by its leg-spinners Shreyas Gopal and Rahul Tewatia, who stifled the CSK middle-order on a wicket that was on the slower side.

Electing to bat, CSK lost Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson cheaply.

The team appeared to build some momentum when Sam Curran and Ambati Rayudu got 15 runs off Ben Stokes in the fifth over.

However, Shreyas accounted for Curran with a googly, forcing the batsman to chip it to long-off, while Tewatia found Rayudu’s top-edge off an attempted sweep to have him caught by the keeper.

Boundaries dry up

CSK failed to score a boundary from the seventh to the 13th over.

The spinners conceded only 32 runs in eight overs between them and bowled a whopping 23 dot balls.

Dhoni (28) and Jadeja (35 n.o., 30b, 4x4) added 51 for the fifth-wicket from 46 balls, but struggled to get the boundaries and power the side to a fighting total.

234,2020/10/19,IPL 2020 | Leg-spinner Pravin Dubey joins Delhi Capitals as Amit Mishra’s replacement,"The 27-year-old leg-spinner has played 14 domestic T20 matches for Karnataka, and has 16 wickets to his name with an economy rate of 6.87.

Delhi Capitals on Monday named Karnataka leg-spinner Pravin Dubey as a replacement for veteran spinner Amit Mishra, who was ruled out of the IPL due to a fractured finger.

The 27-year-old leg-spinner has played 14 domestic T20 matches for his State, and has 16 wickets to his name with an economy rate of 6.87.

“Delhi Capitals today announced the signing of 27-year-old leg spinner Pravin Dubey as replacement for Amit Mishra, for the rest of the Dream11 Indian Premier League,” a media release stated.

Mishra was ruled out of the tournament after sustaining an injury to the ring finger of his bowling arm during Delhi Capitals’ match against Kolkata Knight Riders in Sharjah on October 3.

235,2020/10/19,Indian Premier League 2020 | Was a bit angry and upset heading into the Super Over: Chris Gayle,"After defeating Royal Challengers Bangalore off the last ball, KXIP once again found themselves taking the run chase too deep against Mumbai, leading the game to two Super Overs on Oct. 18

The big-hitting Chris Gayle revealed that he felt “angry and upset” going in to the Super Over after Kings XI Punjab were in a comfortable position to win the IPL match against Mumbai Indians in regulation period.

After defeating Royal Challengers Bangalore off the last ball, KXIP once again found themselves taking the run chase too deep against Mumbai, leading the game to two Super Overs on October 18.

Chasing 11 runs in the second Super Over, the “Universe Boss” cracked a six off the first ball before opener Mayank Agarwal smashed successive fours to give KXIP their second consecutive win.

“No, I wasn’t nervous. I was a bit more angry and upset that we got ourselves in this position. But it’s a game of cricket and these things do happen,” Gayle told Agarwal and Mohammad Shami during a post-match show for IPLT20.com.

“Even when we were going out to bat (in the second Super Over) you asked me ‘who is going to face the first ball’ I was like ‘Mayank you really asked that question? It has to be the boss who faces the first ball’,” Gayle added.

For Punjab, Shami bowled a brilliant first Super Over, defending five runs which was followed by Chris Jordan conceding 11 runs in the second.

“Shami is the man of the match for me. To defend six runs against Rohit (Sharma) and (Quinton) de Kock, that’s fantastic. That’s a great job.

“I have faced you in the nets and I know that you can nail those yorkers, and nail them well. Today he came and delivered and brought it home for us,” Gayle added.

Shami, who nailed his yorkers in the Super Over to allow MI to only equal KXIP’s score, said with the margin of error being so less he just focussed on what he knew he could do best.

“It was very difficult. When you get 15-17 runs to defend in the Super Over, it’s a different matter altogether. You believe at the back of your mind that you can do it.

“But when the margin of error is so less, you focus on what you can do best. I believe a lot in myself. When I was going back on the top of my mark every ball, I was saying to myself, ‘This last ball was great. The next ball will be great too’ I repeated that six times,” Shami added.

In their first match of the tournament against Delhi Capitals, KXIP had failed to score the required single run of the last three balls and the game headed to a Super Over which they they lost. Batting in the second Super Over against MI, Agarwal said he came with the intent of hitting boundaries.

“The game against Delhi Capitals came to my mind. However, Gayle told me ‘Mayank, just watch the ball and the rest will be fine’.

“And that was all that I had in my mind that I have to watch the ball and hit it. I didn’t think about taking ones and twos. I was determined to hit a boundary and luckily it did happen,” Agarwal added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/d6y0r/article32891438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GAYLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-was-a-bit-angry-and-upset-heading-into-the-super-over-chris-gayle/article32891322.ece
236,2020/10/19,"IPL 2020 | After two morale-boosting wins, KXIP to face Delhi Capitals","Death bowing and the form of star player Glenn Maxwell in a shaky middle-order remain a concern for a team that needs to win its remaining five games to make the play-offs.

The nail-biting win over defending champions Mumbai Indians was certainly a morale-lifter but the inconsistent Kings XI Punjab has another tough battle at hand when they take on table leaders Delhi Capitals in Dubai on Tuesday.

Having lost two tight games they should have won at the start of the season, KXIP managed to get on the right side of the results in the last couple of games, although it was too close for comfort by their own admission.

Needing seven off the last two overs with nine wickets in hand, they should have wrapped the game against RCB much before the last ball and even in the IPL’s first double Super Over against Mumbai Indians on Sunday night, the K L Rahul-led side could have closed it out in regulation time.

Death bowing and the form of star player Glenn Maxwell in a shaky middle-order remain a concern for a team that needs to win its remaining five games to make the play-offs.

The fact that KXIP have struggled this season despite having tournament’s top two run-getters in openers Rahul (525) and Mayank Agarwal (393) best sums up their erratic run.

On a positive note, the successful return of Chris Gayle has reduced the burden on the shoulders of the star openers, especially allowing Rahul to play more freely.

Nicholas Pooran has shown his lethalness time and again but is yet to play a match-winning knock and the pressure is increasing on Maxwell the batsman, who is proving to be more useful as a spinner operating in the powerplay.

However, the team is likely to stick to him in the game against Delhi Capitals.

Delhi is clearly the team to beat in the tournament and have gained in confidence with a close win against Chennai Super Kings on Saturday night.

While Prithvi Shaw needs to be back among the runs after a couple of ducks, his opening partner Shikhar Dhawan elevating his game bodes well for the team that has won seven out of the nine matches it has played.

Axar Patel has shown his utility not just with the ball but also with the bat. His three sixes off Ravindra Jadeja helped Delhi get over the line in the final over finish against CSK.

With an envious bowling line-up, Delhi has shown they can defend even below-par totals. Playing in the absence of an injured Rishabh Pant, time is running out for Ajinkya Rahane to make an impact.

The match went into a Super Over last time the two teams met and more than Delhi, KXIP will be hoping that it doesn’t come to that again.

KXIP eventually won the match in the second Super Over.

Kings XI Punjab captain KL Rahul lauded his pace spearhead Mohammed Shami for his ability and clarity of thought to bowl six yorkers in the Super Over while defending just five runs in their dramatic IPL match against Mumbai Indians here.

The match on Sunday night ended in a tie in the regulation 20 overs and KXIP could only score five runs in the first Super Over but Shami bowled brilliantly to restrict MI to the same score.

KXIP eventually won the match in the second Super Over.

“You can never prepare for Super Overs. No team does. So you have to trust your bowler’s gut. You trust your bowler, and let them believe their instinct and gut,” Rahul said at the post-match presentation.

“He (Shami) was very clear he wanted to go with six yorkers. He has been phenomenal, and keeps getting better every game. It is important that senior players win the games for the team.”

Rahul, who was named Man of the Match for his 77, expressed happiness at the victory but said his side would not want to make a habit of winning like this. Even in the last game against RCB, KXIP could have finished the job earlier than they eventually did.

“It is not the first time. But we don’t want to make a habit out of it. We will take the two points in the end. It doesn’t always happen the way you plan so you don’t really know how to stay balanced.

“I was just hoping we get over the line because the boys have been working really really hard. In the games that we have lost, even then we have played well and just not been able to get over the line.”

He said the wicket was slightly slower, increasing the significance of scoring quick runs in the Powerplay.

“I knew Chris (Gayle) and (Nicholas) Pooran... I trust them to take down spinners. So Chris coming in has made my job easier as a batter.”

On his side winning two back-to-back close matches, he said, “We still want to take it one game at a time. It is sweet after the kind of matches we have lost but the talk in the dressing room is to focus on the process.

“We know we need to win everything from here, but we can’t forget the processes that lead to a win.”

Mumbai Indians batsman Kieron Pollard said the match showed that every run counted.

“In T20 cricket, 1 run and 2 runs are very very crucial. I am sure it was great for viewership. KXIP got the better of us and deserved the two points. KL again batted beautifully, going down to a Super Over, congratulations to them,” he said.

“Around the 11-12th over, we knew we were a couple of overs behind. Getting 170-odd, that was a good total - above-par on a track that was on the slower side. With the dimensions, we thought we can defend that.”

Despite the loss, Pollard said his side played good cricket.

“It’s a matter of trying to improve each and every time. There are a couple of areas we need to improve on. We have a four-day break, enough time to reflect. The guys are confident in the dressing room.

“I was told that he (Rohit) is not feeling well (after the loss). We’ll see what happens. He’s a fighter,” said the West Indian who remained not out on 34 off just 12 balls.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/fhaixf/article32890484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHAMIKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-shami-was-very-clear-on-bowling-six-yorkers-in-super-over-kings-xi-punjab-captain-rahul/article32890485.ece

Commenting on Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta’s recent interview to The Hindu wherein the veteran leader had said his party would field new candidates for the municipal elections, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday said that Mr. Gupta had accepted that the current BJP councillors are “corrupt”.

AAP leader Durgesh Pathak said the BJP had changed candidates due to corruption in the 2017 civic polls too.

“In the last 14 years, they have only spread corruption. Their councillors have only stolen from Delhi and filled their own pockets. I am not saying this, former BJP chief Manoj Tiwari agreed that corruption is up to the brim in the management that runs the civic bodies,” Mr. Pathak said during a press meet.

“Naye chehre nayi udaan, Dilli maange kamal nishan was the slogan the BJP used to cover up their corruption. They had said members from 2007-2017 have been banned from participating in the elections. With this promise, Delhiites voted for BJP in the majority. However, people who got elected under this campaign are worse than the ones before. They have stolen so much from the municipalities that the civic bodies are unable to pay the salaries of COVID warriors,” Mr. Pathak said, adding: “I appeal to Delhiites to not fall for the false promises made by the BJP.

239,2020/10/19,Court grants bail to four accused in riots case after police fail to produce evidence,"A local court has granted bail to four persons accused of arson and looting shops of minority community during the north-east Delhi riots in Bhajanpura, noting that the police have failed to produce evidence against them.

A total of eight persons: Neeraj, Manish, Amit Goswami, Sunil Sharma, Sonu Kumar, Rakesh, Mukesh, and Shyam Patel were named in 10 different FIRs for rioting, arson and loot .

The court granted bail to Sonu Kumar and Mukesh on furnishing a bond of ₹20,000 and ₹25,000, respectively, with one surety of like amount in each of the 10 cases. The court also asked them to share their mobile numbers with the SHO of Bhajanpura police station upon their release and keep their phones in working condition. It also asked them to get Aarogya Setu App installed on their phones.

Lawyer Saroj Kumar Jha, who is representing several accused in riots cases, said Shyam Patel, Mukesh and Sonu Kumar were granted bail a few days after their arrest but were released after three months as they were unable to deposit surety bonds.

He said the fourth accused, Sunil Sharma, who too got bail is still in jail as he is unable to deposit surety bonds. Mr. Jha said the bails came after the police failed to produce any direct evidence such as mobile video, CCTV footage to prove the presence of the accused persons at the crime spots.

“In all the FIRs, the witness is common. How can it be possible for a single policeman to be present at all crime spots in the area at the same time,” Mr. Jha said, adding that the police framed the men as they are poor.

Mukesh is a rickshaw puller, Shyam a vegetable vendor, Sonu works as a dishwasher at a restaurant and Sunil is a daily wage worker.

The police claim to have recovered women’s undergarments, cosmetics, massage machines and bangles from Amit’s possession on his disclosure that he had looted a shop belonging to one Gulshan Hussain during the riots. The other men sold the looted goods and spent the money on consumable items, an officer said.

A constable, who is the eyewitness in the case, said that on February 24, he was on duty in Bhajanpura when he saw 70-80 people — armed with iron rods, sticks and kerosene oil — chanting Jai Shree Ram slogans.

The crowd broke open a closed laundry shop, which belonged to a Muslim man, and set it on fire.

The crowd targeted more shops in the area, the constable had stated. He later identified eight people who were part of the crowd.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/court-grants-bail-to-four-accused-in-riots-case-after-police-fail-to-produce-evidence/article32895959.ece

A 28-year-old man has been arrested from Gujarat for allegedly harassing a woman by sending her obscene messages on WhatsApp, the police said on Monday.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Thakur said the accused has been identified as Lad Ashish from Tapi in Gujarat, who works as a sales executive in a car firm.

On July 3, a complaint was received at Hauz Khas police station from a woman who alleged that a man was sending her sexually explicit messages on Whatsapp. Based on her complaint, a case was registered under section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 354A (sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment) of the IPC.

During probe, the police obtained the call detail record and customer acquisition form of the mobile number of the accused. After analysing it, police found that the mobile number was switched off since May but WhatsApp was being used on that number, Mr. Thakur said.

“A notice was sent to WhatsApp to obtain the technical details of the number following which many people were examined but it was found that the number was linked to Ashish in Gujarat,” he said.

A team was sent to Gujarat and after sustained interrogation, the accused admitted to the crime. “He previously did not know the complainant but saw her name on Truecaller and later started harassing her,” Mr. Thakur said.

The mobile phone, used to send vulgar messages, was recovered from his possession.

243,2020/10/19,"Police unearths drug syndicate, four arrested","Two of the accused are from Andhra Pradesh

Four persons, including two from Andhra Pradesh, have been arrested after the police unearthed a drug syndicate, said officials on Monday.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Anto Alphonse said the accused have been identified as Sholai Raj (66) and Ramesh (36) — both from Mori Gate —, Poleju Babu Rao (30) and Gudepu Nageshwara Rao (26) — both from Vishakhapatnam.

A complaint was received at Gulabi Bagh police station that Rajiv, a bad character, is a drug peddler who carries illegal firearms and is absconding in an armed robbery case.

Police fired at

During probe, Rajiv was found outside his house on October 9 and when police tried to apprehend him, he pulled out a countrymade pistol and fired at the officials. Rajiv’s family members also attacked the police personnel with chilli powder and smashed police vehicle.

After the incident, patrolling in the area was increased to keep a watch on drug peddlers after which the first arrest was made of Sarika, who was allegedly selling ganja. Subsequently, Seema and Roma were arrested for the same offence over the next few days.

Women’s group — Pinjra Tod — on Monday demanded registration of an FIR into the alleged rape and murder of a 17-year-old Dalit girl, who was found dead at her employer’s house in north Delhi’s Model Town.

The group also sought action against police personnel, who were allegedly involved in custodial violence of the family members, students, activists and a journalist — part of the protest on October 16. They demanded the withdrawal of the FIR registered against 10 persons, who were detained.

246,2020/10/19,‘Will give fresh faces a chance again in 2022 polls’,"BJP’s main strategy for the elections is to expose the AAP government’s failures on the civic front

With a vision to enhance its stature in the 2022 civic body elections, the BJP in Delhi has pressed the reboot button. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta speaks to The Hindu on issues ranging from the recent reorganisation of the party’s State unit and internal discontent to repeating its strategy of fielding fresh faces in the polls.

You took over the reins of BJP’s Delhi unit months after its defeat in the Assembly polls. What is your plan to rejuvenate the party in Delhi?

We have started doing that from the bottom upwards. We began with making a new team and reorganising the party’s organisation from the mandal level. In fact, both the zila and mandal levels have been reorganised to include women, young faces, and those with an impeccable social image. From October 25, we will begin training the new team at identifying and countering the failures of the AAP government and in the merits and the vision of the Modi-led government at the Centre. Over 28,000 party workers will be trained in relation to the vision, ideology and organisational integrity of the party.

How did you choose individuals for various posts?

The main objective was to pump young and energetic individuals into the party. No one was chosen because they are considered close to someone else. We did not impose the choices of the party’s leadership on the cadre. We surveyed and made choices on the basis of the opinions of over 5,000 individuals connected to the party and by considering how they could add to the organisational strength of the State unit.

There seems to be some discontent in the unit after the reorganisation. Some individuals — from MPs to previous office bearers — are apparently unhappy. How do you plan to persuade everyone to come together and work for the same objective?

I would not say there is discontent but, rather, disagreements which are characteristic of any big family. The party’s constitution limits the number of posts but just because someone did not get one doesn’t mean they will not be utilised. We have spoken to each other about the fact that overall we now have a very good team with an average age of 47; the strengths and efforts of every individual will be needed and utilised whether or not they occupy a post.

What are your strategies for the municipal polls in 2022? What do you think are the strengths you will build your campaign on?

Despite being starved for funds, the Municipal Corporations of Delhi have done very good work in public healthcare, education and mitigating pollution, which the people of the city know. Delhi has a peculiar system because of its municipality authorities. Many times, the civic body does the best possible work but it either falls through because of the inaction of another authority. People know this. On one hand, we have undertaken projects such as improvements related to landfills – both the Bhalswa and Ghazipur landfills will see drastic reductions in height within a year – and on the other, we will expose the Delhi government for its failure in not doing what it has the power to, in relation to civic issues for the elections.

Are you likely to field fresh faces in the municipal elections like in 2017? Do you think such a strategy would work again? What is your stance on the reunification of the three civic bodies?

It is too early to say precisely what the party will do but I will say that it believes in the potential of such an approach. It believes in pumping fresh blood into the organisation and giving people with a clean image and reputation a platform to influence social change. So we will surely give such people a chance in 2022 as well. As far as reunification is concerned, that is a long process and there is no proposal for it at the moment though it is clear that they were divided due to political reasons. At the end of the day, whether there are three bodies or one, they will depend on funding from the State government, which is hurting them by delaying funds.

Delhi government is attacking the BJP-run civic bodies on a daily basis, regarding the lack of funds to run hospitals and schools. How do you respond to these charges? Where does the problem related to funding actually lie and why?

In this city, the fact that the civic bodies do 90% of the work and must remain dependent on the Delhi government for 90% of the funds is a tragedy. The Delhi government has surpassed all limits when it comes to starving the corporations for funds which obviously hampers their work. But in spite of it, they have performed exceedingly well on various fronts. On one hand, there are the civic bodies that are doing the best they can despite delayed funding and on the other, is a government which promises to pay the examination fees of economically backward students but refuses to do that at a time when they are struggling due to the COVID-19 crisis. There have been times in the past when there was one party’s government at the Centre and another’s in the city but such politics around funding didn’t exist; it was never this bad.

Speaking of politics, both the Delhi BJP and AAP have more or less gone silent on the Delhi riots. What is your opinion?

The riots were a sponsored conspiracy to aid appeasement politics. It is clear and there are WhatAapp chats to prove that Popular Front of India, AAP and Tukde Tukde gang came together to create the riots. AAP’s Tahir Hussain was not acting alone; he is connected to AAP’s senior leadership. People were called to wreak havoc for the political gain of others.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/7ij1e6/article32888242.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ADESHKUMARGUPTAAPPOINTEDDELHIBJPPRESIDENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/will-give-fresh-faces-a-chance-again-in-2022-polls/article32888243.ece

Mr. Kejriwal welcomed the move and thanked the shopkeepers for taking part and protecting themselves and their customers from dengue.

The seventh week of the programme sought to encourage shopkeepers in national capital to inspect their shops and surroundings for stagnant water every Sunday for 10 minutes and drain it to prevent the breeding of dengue mosquitoes around them.

248,2020/10/19,Workers allege termination without notice,"The women say the garments export company has not paid their legal dues

Eight women workers of a garments export company, Chelsea Mills in Udyog Vihar Phase-IV here, have filed a complaint before the Labour Department against the management for “terminating” them without assigning any reason and also not paying their legal dues.

The women also staged a demonstration outside the company this past week seeking reinstatement.

The workers, in a complaint to the department, alleged that the management “terminated” them when the company, Chelsea Mills, reopened after the COVID-19-induced lockdown, without any reason, notice and charge.

The women claimed that they had been working with the company for the past several years and completed the mandatory 240 days of service over the past 12 months before being terminated. They said that the company had not paid them notice period compensation, retrenchment compensation, bonus and gratuity, thereby causing them serious financial hardship.

Garment and Allied Workers Union general-secretary Amarnath Sharma said the garments companies in the area had been terminating old workers, citing lack of work due to the lockdown, but they are hiring new workers at lower wages.

Deputy Labour Commissioner, Gurugram, Ramesh Ahuja, said the company had been maintaining that the women were not terminated, but were not being called to work as the production had gone down. “Since the company maintained that the workers were not terminated and also not laid off, they are entitled to complete wages. We have written to the Labour Secretary in this connection, saying that the conduct of the company falls under the category of unfair labour practices under the Industrial Disputes Act. The workers have also filed a complaint before the Additional Labour Commissioner, seeking reinstatement and the matter is under consideration,” said Mr. Ahuja.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/workers-allege-termination-without-notice/article32888212.ece
249,2020/10/19,No virus death in Haryana after over four months,"1,640 people have lost their lives so far

After a gap of over four months, no COVID-19 related death was reported in Haryana on Sunday. The last time zero death was reported was on June 6.

“Haryana Health Department is happy to announce that no death has been reported on account of COVID-19 today [Sunday]. While it is heartening, there is no room for complacency and the Haryana Health Department will remain in the highest position of alert till there is a lasting solution to the infection,” said Additional Chief Secretary Health and Home, Rajeev Arora.

Fatality rate

As per latest statistics, 1,640 people, including 1,143 males, have lost their lives due to the infection in the State so far with a fatality rate of 1.09 %.

Those died include 1,448 with co-morbidities. Faridabad at 238 has recorded the highest number of deaths, followed by Gurugram (190), Karnal (115) and Panchkula (106). Charkhi Dadri has reported four deaths, the least in the State.

A total of 1,50,033 people have tested positive for COVID-19 so far and there are 10,042 active cases. On Sunday, 169 people in the State were on oxygen support and 31 on ventilator.

250,2020/10/19,Slight improvement in AQI in Delhi-NCR,"It is predicted to stay in the higher end of ‘poor’ to lower end of ‘very poor’ category

The air quality of Delhi, Gurugram and Noida improved slightly and was in the ‘poor’ category on Sunday, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.

The AQI of Delhi is expected to be in ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’ category as there has been an increase in stubble burning in neighbouring States, said government-run monitoring agency System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).

The AQI of Delhi was 254 and the values for Gurugram and Noida were 273 and 252 respectively, as per CPCB’s 4 p.m. bulletin on Sunday, which is an average of the past 24 hours.

An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.

“The wind speed is forecast to marginally improve for the next two days leading to relatively better dispersion. However, the AQI is predicted to stay in the higher end of ‘poor’ to the lower end of ‘very poor’category for next two days. Though fire emission has increased and transport-level wind direction is also favourable, an increase in transport-level wind speed as well as local Delhi surface winds are likely to maintain the stubble contribution in Delhi PM2.5 around the same level,” SAFAR said.

The stubble burning fire counts around Haryana, Punjab and neighbouring border regions of Delhi were 1,230 on Saturday, as per SAFAR.

The contribution of stubble burning in the neighbouring States to the PM2.5, a chief pollutant, in Delhi is estimated to be around 17% on Sunday. The wind direction is favourable for transport of pollutants due to stubble burning in other States to the city. Also, the local wind speed is less and this leads to pollutants not getting dispersed easily and in turn, negatively affects the air quality of Delhi.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/vu1v5r/article32888206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL19-POLLUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/slight-improvement-in-aqi-in-delhi-ncr/article32888207.ece
251,2020/10/19,Man arrested wrongfully in riots case granted bail,"HC says senior citizen a victim, his house damaged in incident

The Delhi High Court has granted bail to a 65-year-old man, who was arrested in connection with the north-east Delhi riots, noting there was no evidence against him and that rather he was a victim of the incident.

“That petitioner [Mr. Singh] is a victim of the riots. His house was also damaged by an unlawful assembly to which he has also lodged a complaint dated February 28,” the court said.

Justice Suresh Kumar Kait granted bail to Mithan Singh against whom the police have registered a case for rioting at Khajuri Khas police station here.

The Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) had opposed bail plea stating that there are serious allegations against Mr. Singh of him playing “an active role in the riots”. The SPP said Mr. Singh’s name cropped up after different complaints were merged.

‘Complaints merged’

The SPP said the complaints made on March 3 and March 5 did not mention Mr Singh’s name but he and his son’s name cropped up on March 13 when other complaints were merged. The SPP said the bail plea deserves to be dismissed.

Justice Kait, however, pointed out that on perusal of the complaints initially made, it reveals that no role was assigned to Mr. Singh, however, in supplementary statements he and his sons are named.

‘No video or photograph’

“It is also a fact that there is no video clip or photograph on record against the petitioner whereby the petitioner was chargesheeted in the present crime,” Justice Kait said adding, “In view of above, I am of the view that the petitioner deserves bail.” The court ordered that Mr. Singh shall be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of ₹25,000 with one surety in the like amount.

“It is made clear that the trial court shall not get influenced by the observations made by this court while passing the order,” it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/mmfgjy/article32888185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE18RIOTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/man-arrested-wrongfully-in-riots-case-granted-bail/article32888187.ece

There are a total of 2,770 containment zones.

253,2020/10/19,Bypoll an opportunity to wrest Baroda: Dhankar,"Region’s development most important issue in the by-election: Haryana BJP chief

Haryana BJP president Om Prakash Dhankar reckons that that Baroda bypoll is an “opportunity” for the ruling BJP-JJP coalition, but a “litmus test” for the Congress.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Dhankar countered the Congress rhetoric that Baroda bypoll would be a referendum on the government’s work. He said the seat traditionally belonged to the Congress and the BJP had never won it.

“It is a litmus test for the Congress. It is to be seen whether they retain or lose it. For us, it is an opportunity like the Jind bypoll last year. And we are working hard to convert this opportunity into an achievement,” said Mr. Dhankar, who took over the reins of the party in July this year.

Development hurdles

He accused Mr. Hooda of doing “little” for the region’s development in his tenure as Chief Minister, claiming that his party had approved two colleges, a university and an Industrial Model Township for the Assembly segment pledging ₹200-300 crore over the past few months.

Mr. Dhankar said development was the most important issue in the by-election and the key to it was with the BJP in Haryana and Delhi for the next four years.

“The Congress did only lip service. The BJP will do the real service. People of the region are making up their mind for development,” he quipped.

Mr. Dhankar, a former Haryana Agriculture Minister, said the BJP had succeeded in convincing the farmers on the three legislations, adding that he didn’t think there was any resentment among the farming community in Haryana. “Now only those who are in habit of holding agitations are left on the ground protesting. And they are frustrated,” he said.

The 59-year-old leader accused the Congress of playing the politics of “hypothetical fears”, adding that people had now seen through its tactics.

Playing the politics

“They tried to create an atmosphere of fear by saying that crops will not be bought on Minimum Support Price and mandis cease to exist. But the crop is being bought on MSP and the mandis are running. Now they say the government will gradually stop procurement on MSP. Congress has this habit to play politics by showing fear of hypothetical situations. They did so [played politics] on Article 370 and triple talaq. But people have seen through it,” argued Mr. Dhankar.

On the guarantee for MSP, Mr. Dhankar said no one can control the entire market in a country and the demand was not “viable”. He, however, asserted that the government would continue to procure crops on MSP.

On the coalition partners failing to reach a Common Minimum Programme for the governance even a year after they came into power, Mr. Dhankar conceded that though nothing was available in “black and white”, the two parties had reached an agreement on 30-odd points and had a few differences.

“The coalition is running on the common and viable points of the manifestos of the two parties,” said Mr. Dhankar. He said that he aimed to expand the base of the party in the State and change the electoral pattern so that the party remained in power for long. “Though people in Haryana don’t usually repeat the government unlike Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, I hope to change it and make sure that the party get mandate for long,” said Mr. Dhankar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rjbz24/article32888152.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL19-DHANKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bypoll-an-opportunity-to-wrest-baroda-dhankar/article32888153.ece

The accused — Munnalal Mavasi — from Satna district in Madhya Pradesh, is a graduate and holds a diploma in veterinary. He worked as a veterinary doctor in his village and later joined a firm — International Marketing Corporation, they said.

To earn quick money, he started committing the crime along with his accomplices. Two mobile phones, which were used to create fake FB IDs, have been recovered. The matter came to the fore on September 26 after an IPS officer lodged a complaint at Lodhi Colony police station alleging that someone had created his fake account on Facebook. He also said the accused asked for money from his friends on the pretext of an emergency.

255,2020/10/19,Student moves HC after govt. school denies admission,"Petition alleges 18-year-old had applied for enrolment but was not accepted due to age restrictions

A student has approached the Delhi High Court alleging that a government school had denied admission to him on grounds of his age being higher than the requirement.

Shekh Habibul, who is 18-and-a-half-year-old, said he was forced to leave his private school due to financial constraints during the pandemic. He was studying in K.D. Model School at Bawana Road in Barwala since Class II. He passed his Class X CBSE examinations earlier this year.

Habibul said his family suffered a major financial loss after the COVID-19 outbreak and could not pay his school fee.

The petition, filed through advocate Ashok Agarwal, stated that Habibul has been trying to get admission in Government Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, Prahalad Pur in Delhi, under non-plan admission since the first week of September.

Mr. Aggarwal said the student had visited school several times and also applied for admission in Class XI through online mode under non-plan admission for academic session 2020-21, which was not accepted on the website.

Mr. Aggarwal stated that the government has issued a circular laying down age criteria for non-plan admissions in government schools, seeking direct admission, in all classes upto to Class XII for the academic session 2020-21.

The circular provides that only those students will be granted direct admission in Class XI who are over 15 years of age but are less than 17 years.

The circular further provides that the age criteria laid down is not applicable to plan admissions i.e. the existing students of government schools.

The plea contended that there is no justification on part of the government school to deny admission to Habibul on grounds of his age. The plea stated that Habibul has no gap in his studies and him coming from a private school to a government school cannot be a ground for differentiation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/student-moves-hc-after-govt-school-denies-admission/article32888024.ece

257,2020/10/19,Youth ‘beaten to death’ by neighbours,"A 22-year-old man was allegedly beaten to death by a group of men in east Delhi’s New Ashok Nagar on Friday, the police said on Sunday.

The victim, Manish Yadav, was found unconscious in the building where he lives with his family on rent. His family alleged that he was beaten to death. “We have registered an FIR. The post-mortem report is awaited,” said an officer.

However, during probe, the police said the incident happened when Manish came home late at night from work with a friend. Manish worked at an automobile workshop in Noida.

An officer said the duo consumed alcohol in the building. Next, when Manish was leaving the building to drop his friend, he urinated at the toilet inside the premises when one of his neighbour complained against it. “A group of people started beating him.

258,2020/10/19,The permanent wealth,"Vallalar finds Lord Muruga delightful. His mind is filled with joy whenever he thinks of Muruga. He extols Him as the One who is always young. Vallalar sees Him as his wealth. Appar says that all you need to do is to contemplate on Lord Siva’s feet. The moment you do that, it seems as if honey has dropped by your side. In Peria Puranam, Sekkizhar speaks of Sundaramurthy Nayanar’s delight upon seeing Lord Siva’s divine dance. When a devotee’s mind is full of thoughts of his favourite deity, then wherever he looks, he sees his God, said M.A. Manickavelu in a discourse. Whatever he hears, it seems as if that deity’s name is being recited.

Varagunapandian, king of Madurai, was a devotee of Lord Siva. Once, he asked his ministers to build a roof over a neem tree, because of the many lingas in it. The ministers were puzzled, for how could there be any lingas in a tree? Varagunapandian, however, insisted that there were indeed many lingas on the neem tree, and he pointed to the fruits in the neem tree as lingas. So engrossed was he in thinking about Lord Siva, that the fruits of the neem tree appeared as lingas to him. The same king once happened to pass a pond, and he called out to his ministers and told them to cast rice and ragi into the pond. Again, his order seemed bizarre to the ministers. Varagunapandian then explained that there were devotees of Lord Siva inside the pond chanting, “Hara, Hara.” Actually, the only inhabitants of the pond were frogs, and their croaking sounded like the chants of Siva bhaktas to the king. Every sight, every sound reminded him of Siva.

Vallalar says Muruga is his wealth. This wealth is never destroyed. There is always the danger of losing any other wealth, but Lord Muruga is always there for His devotees.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/the-permanent-wealth/article32894995.ece
259,2020/10/19,Check out these eco-friendly corn dolls,"These eco-friendly corn husk dolls, made by a Delhi student, could be an innovative addition to golu

Nineteen-year-old Madhumita Karan from South Delhi is fascinated with the idea of making art from waste. This is how her corn husk doll came to be.

Madhumita then sent this particular doll to Chitra Mukherjee’s residence, where her mother is employed as the domestic help. “These corn husk dolls are amazing. I was impressed by the fact that it was created using waste material. These dolls are part of the culture and tradition in Western countries and are rather expensive,” says Chitra, who then posted the photos of these dolls on social media.

Madhumita used to collect corn husk from roadside vendors in Delhi to make these dolls. But during the pandemic, she began to buy whole corn and use the husk to create dolls. Corn, is a summer crop, which is available only from July to September. She collects husk from wholesale markets, and stocks it for later.

“After seeing photographs of my dolls on social media, more orders are pouring in,” says Madhumita, adding that, “This is the first time I am selling my work of art, and my first order for six dolls came from Chennai.”

City-based architect, S Thirupurasundari, is the first to have placed an order for the dolls as they rekindled fond memories of her childhood. “Twenty-three years ago my grandfather had gifted me a corn husk doll from Italy. It is still in good condition. This shows that these dolls have a long life if preserved well. I was impressed by the detailing Madhumita has given to each of her dolls. Corn husk dolls will be the highlight at our golu this Navratri,” says Thirupurasundari.

After doing extensive research online about corn husk dolls, Madhumita learnt about the different techniques used to make them. “I have made about 23 different types of dolls so far, and I am in the process of creating them in ethnic Indian outfits,” she says.

Dolls by Madhumita, as she calls them, has detailing such as buttons, bow ties, laces, frills, bonnets, baskets, flowers, cap, scarves and hats.

“It takes almost an hour and a half to make one doll, but the processing and preparation take an entire day,” says Madhumita. She carefully removes the husks, washes them in clean water, wipes with a clean cloth and lets them dry in the shade.

Once the husk is pruned and damaged edges are trimmed, it is ready to use. The colour is made by mixing water, salt and and dye and boiling them for 20 minutes. The artist also uses natural leaves, twigs and flowers for embellishments. “Twigs, twine and maida paste are used to design and bind the doll. The toughest part is making the hat,” she says.

Says Chitra, “So many queries began to pour in soon after I posted the images of these dolls. I am glad to see this young girl transform into a young entrepreneur.”

“I am overwhelmed,” says Madhumita, discussing the response. “I wonder how I am going to keep up with the demand.”

260,2020/10/19,"33 dead, ₹679 cr. loss in city due to floods: KTR","80 colonies still inundated, power yet to be restored in the purview of 164 distribution transformers

Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MA&UD) K.T. Rama Rao put the tentative estimate of loss due to floods in the Greater Hyderabad region at ₹679 crore.

The estimate takes into consideration the damage to the city infrastructure and relief and rehabilitation efforts; the figure could rise in the coming days.

A total of 33 deaths have been confirmed while three persons have gone missing due to flooding. Compensation of ₹5 lakh has been paid to the kin of 29 flood victims.

So far, there has not been any response from the Centre for Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s request for financial assistance of ₹1,350 crore, the Minister said while briefing the media about the flood response on Monday. Eighty special officers have been deployed for flood relief operations in GHMC and surrounding municipalities, and together with local officials from other departments, they will be solely on pre-disaster, disaster rescue and relief and rehabilitation tasks for the coming 15 days. All other programmes by GHMC stand suspended.

‘City’s second highest rainfall’

Terming the recent rainfall as the second highest in the history of Hyderabad, Mr.Rama Rao said there is a possibility of the annual rainfall this year in the city setting a new high. Against the average rainfall of 78 cm, the year has so far clocked 120 cm, leading to inundation. As of now, 80 colonies remain under water, including 17 that were flooded during the first spell of rain up to October 14.

Apart from GHMC, several colonies in adjoining municipalities such as Peerzadiguda, Badangpet, Meerpet, Pedda Amberpet, and Turkayamjal too have been affected.

Fifty four apartment complexes remain inundated, and power is yet to be restored in the purview of 164 distribution transformers. A total of 920 transformers have been repaired and restored so far. The damage has been more pronounced in south and east zones of GHMC.

Thousands of people have been rescued by the government through Disaster Response Force, and transferred to relief camps, Mr.Rama Rao said, and urged residents of the affected areas not to stay in the upper storeys of buildings as they may weaken due to flood water seepage, or cause electrocution.

Mr.Rama Rao said a total of 37,000 people have been shifted to relief camps, where about 2,000 remain now. More people will be shifted in the coming days, as there is heavy rain warning for three days from IMD.

GHMC has, so far, spent ₹45 crore on flood relief operations, while the HMWS&SB, and TSSPDCL have spent close to ₹6 crore. A special sanitation drive is being taken up to clear the roads of debris and sludge, and disinfect the localities. For the past one week, 59 dilapidated buildings have been razed, to prevent building collapse fatalities. Ration kits worth ₹2,800 are being distributed to the affected people. The kit contains 11 items, including rice, pulses, sugar, tea powder and a blanket.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/w1t6rc/article32895919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19-3CHADERGHATBRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/33-dead-679-cr-loss-in-city-due-to-floods-ktr/article32895904.ece
261,2020/10/19,Distressed ryots seek govt. intervention,"Acres of paddy fields disappear in flood, crops ready for harvest submerged and harvested heaps soaked

Not far from the Valigonda bridge, where at least a dozen heavy vehicles were washed away in Musi river, farmers of the abutting Mallepally and Nagaram villages who recently harvested their crops crestfallen.

With little hope, they keep busy with a wooden rake to regularly comb the flat beds of soaked paddy in their front yards.

“Profit or loss, this last stage decides,” Hithapu Laxmamma, who reaped three of the five acres harvest, says. “The two-acre crop which was ready for harvest is flat in the fields like a mat spread on the floor,” she adds.

Employing workers

Now, she has employed workers at ₹500 per person, for sun-drying the produce, after which the stock needs to be transported to the local market yard, where a queue token should be collected to sell it.

Officials would test the grain for moisture (not to exceed 17%), and finally if Laxmamma’s paddy ticks all the quality checks, she would get the minimum support price of ₹1,888 per quintal (grade A).

But grain moisture is two types – internal and external.

With a slight change in weather, or while in the ‘tractor queue’ at the yard, if moisture exceeds, the whole cycle should be repeated and the quality is lost, the 60-year-old illiterate farmer explains.

A private trader would buy the stock offering up to ₹1,400 for the same quantity, but it does not work out any profit, others say. Valigonda, one of the mandals with large excess rainfall in the State, has 977 paddy farmers in despair in 1, 911 acres. For cotton, the damage figures are 580 acres and 201 farmers.

The mandal is not exclusive, but representative of the rest of the mandals in undivided Nalgonda, which report similar losses and severe damages in about 1,12,000 acres, as per preliminary reports.

Officials state large acres of fields have disappeared in the flood, crops ready for harvest are inundated and the harvested heaps soaked.

In the much-affected mandals like Pochampally, Choutuppal, Nalgonda and Munugode, farmers say local leaders have extended words of comfort, but procurement did not take off.

Groups of agitated farmers, with sprouted paddy, continue to block highways, or the District Collector’s vehicle, praying for action.

On the other hand, tenant farmers such as M. Yadagiri of Valigonda, who do not appear in official records, wonder about their situation. Having cultivated 10 acres on rented farm, Yadagiri’s crop damage is in six acres.

“No matter what, I have to pay the share or its equivalent cash to the landlord. With two consecutive bad seasons, my present debt is more than ₹4 lakh. I don’t see a future,” he says.

Compensation sought

Sangareddy Special Correspondent adds: Urging the government to come to their rescue, several farmers staged a dharna before the Collectorate on Monday.

Farmers under the banners of Telangana Manjeera Rythu Samakhya and district unit of All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) organised the dharna.

Problem of debts

“We have lost crops like paddy and cotton due to heavy rains, and there is nothing left. We do not know how to clear the debts taken for cultivation. We request the government to come to our rescue and save us,” the farmers urged the government. They were led by Manjeera Rythu Samkhya leader Pruthvi Raj.

AIKS district secretary G. Jayaraj demanded that all the crops are lost and that farmers must be paid compensation immediately.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/zdwyds/article32895889.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20PADDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/distressed-ryots-seek-govt-intervention/article32895890.ece
262,2020/10/19,TN govt. contributes ₹10 cr. to Telangana,"Palaniswami assures all assistance for rain and flood relief operations

The Tamil Nadu government has announced immediate contribution of ₹10 crore to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund of Telangana for taking up relief and rehabilitation measures in the rain/flood-hit areas.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said his government is ready to render any other assistance as may be required by the Telangana government in this hour of crisis. The neighbouring State government has decided to send blankets and mats as relief material to the affected families.

Mr. Palaniswami, in a letter addressed to his Telangana counterpart K. Chandrasekhar Rao, said he has ordered the contribution to CMRF as a token of support and solidarity of the government and people of Tamil Nadu to Telangana’s citizens affected by the calamity. He expressed concern that heavy rains and unprecedented floods in Hyderabad and certain districts of Telangana caused extensive damage to property and loss of lives.

“Your efficient and quick handling of the disaster and the response of your government in providing relief and rescue operations have quickly mitigated the adverse effects of the floods,” he wrote in the letter to Mr Rao and conveyed heartfelt condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the rain and floods.

For his part, Mr. Rao thanked Mr. Palaniswami for the generous gesture and welcomed the latter’s decision to send blankets and mats for relief of the affected families.

Mr. Rao exhorted industrialists, traders, business establishments and others to also come forward and extend help to the people affected due to heavy rain and floods.

264,2020/10/19,Cotton with lower moisture content to be paid more than MSP,"Procurement at 300 ginning mills, 9 market yards

At a time when the farming community’s hopes of getting a bumper harvest of major crops such as cotton and paddy are hit badly by excessive rains this season, the State government has decided to give higher price than minimum support price of ₹5,825 to cotton, provided the moisture content of the fibre crop is less than 8%.

At a meeting held with officials here on Monday on the arrangements being made for procurement of cotton, Minister for Agriculture Singireddy Niranjan Reddy has asked the cotton ginning millers to enter into agreement with the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) at the earliest and instructed the marketing and agriculture department officials to establish a call centre in every district to accept complaints and suggestions from farmers.

Cotton crop has been cultivated in a record extent of over 60.22 lakh acres and paddy in about 52.55 lakh acres this season. However, excessive rains, particularly during the recent spell, have damaged standing crops badly.

The two crops have been damaged in large extents across the State.

“We have been waiting for good sunshine for the last two weeks to commence the first picking of cotton, which gives maximum of the yield out of multiple pickings. However, the rain gods have nailed our hopes of bumper yields as the flowers (cotton) which were ready for plucking have either been damaged/discoloured on the plant itself or have fallen to the ground due to the intensity of rains,” Rachamma, a woman farmer in Sangareddy district said.

With the ground situation being grim, the government has decided to give higher price to the farmers who get cotton with lower moisture content than 8% as prescribed by CCI for getting the MSP. The Minister stated that CCI is ready to open the procurement centres in 300 ginning mills and nine market yards.

The Minister explained that cotton with 8% moisture content would be given a price of ₹5,825 per quintal, ₹5,766.75 per quintal for cotton with 9% moisture, ₹5,708.5 for 10% moisture, ₹5,650.25 for 11% moisture and ₹5,582 for 12% moisture. In case the moisture content is 6%, farmers would be paid ₹5,941.5 per quintal and ₹5,883.25 per quintal if the moisture content is 7%.

The operators of procurement centres have also been instructed to arrange web cameras, finger print scanner, moisture measuring implements and electronic weighing scales before commencement of the procurement operations. The Agriculture Extension Officers and Agriculture Officers have been told to issue token to farmers village-wise to bring their produce to procurement centres in a scheduled/phased manner.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cotton-with-lower-moisture-content-to-be-paid-more-than-msp/article32895863.ece

267,2020/10/19,Over 100 snakes rescued from inundated areas,"Be cautious while moving debris and vegetation, say snake society volunteers

With several parts of Hyderabad and its peripheries inundated, snakes too were forced to crawl out of burrows filled with water. Between October 15 and 17, volunteers of Friends of Snakes Society rescued over 100 snakes. They found the reptiles in car bonnets, staircases and even inside cupboards.

For people returning to their homes where water has receded, the volunteers advise that they must be cautious while clearing debris and vegetation that washed up at their doorstep.

General secretary of the society, Avinash Visvanathan suggests one must poke vegetation or debris with a stick before lifting it up. Volunteer Aditya Srinath says, “During the rescue, people ask if snakes take revenge. That is a misconception. All they need is a warm place to hide.”

Most of the reptiles were rescued from flooded localities in Vanasthalipuram, L.B. Nagar, Balapur, Meerpet, Hayathnagar, Attapur, Tolichowki, Miyapur Ameenpur and Beeramguda. “The most common types rescued were Spectacled Cobra, Rat Snake and Checkered Keelback. Of the three, the Spectacled Cobras are venomous. Their sighting is on the rise,” says Mr Avinash.

He advises people not to panic when they spot a reptile as snakes are cold-blooded and need external source of heat to increase their activity,including biting. “The ambient temperature falls during the rains, thereby reducing their activity and chances of snake bites. However, it is better if people maintain distance from the reptiles,” he says

In case of a snake bite, one can approach any government hospital. Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy said anti-venoms are stocked in all government hospitals, including Primary Health Centres.

270,2020/10/19,"RTCs of TS, A.P. yet to agree on trips","Full-fledged resumption of inter-State buses unlikely by Dasara

With Dasara scheduled to be celebrated in less than a week, the State road transport undertakings of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are yet to agree upon the full-fledged resumption of inter-State buses.

The Telangana State Road Transport Corporation and the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation, thus far, have been unable to come to an agreement either on the number of buses each will ply, nor the number of kilometres. Despite officials of both State transport undertakings meeting, the impasse has been on for nearly a month.

A TSRTC official familiar with the issue said, “So far, no agreement has been reached.” When asked whether a temporary arrangement could be arrived at, he said that the situation does not indicate that this would be the case. Festivals, including Dasara, see a large number of passengers travelling between both States. This, could in turn, generate revenue.

Last year, the TSRTC ran 575 special buses to Andhra Pradesh from the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station from September 29 to October 10.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/x674l0/article32895021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20RTC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rtcs-of-tsap-yet-to-agree-on-trips/article32895022.ece

272,2020/10/19,Rumours of cracks on Hyderabad’s Puranapul bridge keeps GHMC on tenterhooks,"Engineers inspect the spot, dismiss the rumours as unfounded.

Rumours circulating about dangerous cracks in a bridge over Musi River near Purana Pul have kept the GHMC officials on tenterhooks for some time on Monday morning.

Several thought the bridge in question was the age-old Qutub Shah-era bridge, but officials later clarified that this bridge was constructed 35 years ago.

A video circulated on social media showed some cracks in masonry, claimed that the bridge has become dangerous for traffic and might collapse. The slanting position of the pillars too had given rise to apprehensions.

Following this, the bridge was closed for traffic during morning hours.

Officials including Engineer in Chief (Projects) R. Sreedhar and Chief Engineer (Maintenance) Mohd. Ziauddin reached the spot with their teams to inspect the condition of the bridge.

Later, speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Ziauddin dismissed the rumours unfounded. As the bridge was old, the steel frame was exposed at one spot and it can be repaired easily, he said. The slant in the pillars was as per the design and is not due to damage.

The bridge was immediately opened for traffic after the inspection. However, as a precautionary measure, heavy tonnage is advised to be disallowed till the repair is done. The Traffic Police have been told to instead clear encroachments on the Muslim Jung bridge and use it for heavy loads.

The bridge will eventually be taken up for periodic maintenance as is usual with such structures.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/d0f1ja/article32890781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bridge-hyd,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rumours-of-cracks-on-hyderabads-puranapul-bridge-keeps-ghmc-on-tenterhooks/article32890782.ece

275,2020/10/19,Bhatti calls Mahabubnagar bandh on Oct. 21 against pump house mishap,"Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhatti Vikramarka Mallu has called for a bandh of combined Mahabubnagar district on October 21 blaming the government for the submergence of the Kalwakurthy LIP pump house and the undemocratic way of preventing Congress leaders from visiting the site.

Mr. Bhatti along with MLAs Duddila Sreedhar Babu and T. Jagga Reddy and MLC T. Jeevan Reddy were arrested at Veldanda while they were going to inspect the site. Mr. Bhatti argued with the police against their detention but to no avail. Police blocked their vehicles and did not permit them arguing that there was no permission to visit the site.

He argued with the police on how ministers and TRS MLAs were being allowed but not Congress leaders. “Why is the Chief Minister afraid of Congress leaders’ visit?”, he asked and said that the police were busy arresting only the Congress leaders.

“It is time people realise how dangerous this strategy of the government was as more than ₹1,000 crore public money was lost,” he said, adding that this was due to corrupt practices. He alleged that KCR was executing these projects by making retired engineer Muralidhar Rao sign, according to his wishes. Despite several experts objecting to underground pump sets of PRLIS near the KLIS project, the government went ahead to benefit the contractors, he added.

Mr. Jagga Reddy said people have every right to know about the accident and demanded that only a CBI inquiry into the redesigning of projects can reveal the truth. He said once Congress comes back to power it would not leave anyone involved in corruption in the irrigation projects.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/vhfxtd/article32331427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11-BHATTIVIKRAMARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bhatti-calls-mahabubnagar-bandh-on-oct-21-against-pump-house-mishap/article32888401.ece
276,2020/10/19,"Politicians’ photo opportunity, but citizens’ problems are never-ending","Assurances but no implementation

Come natural calamity, one sees ministers and MLAs visiting various localities with officials in tow.

The deluge that hit the State capital and other areas proved yet another occasion for ministers and higher officials to visit various areas and console people. They no doubt announced the government’s commitment to resolve their problems during interaction with the affected residents.

But how far are these assurances materialising remains the moot question. This could be seen from the plight of people who are confronted with a second spell of heavy rain, days after the city witnessed it’s second highest rainfall on a single day in a century.

The bad roads remained the same and water-logging continued while several areas witnessed inundation causing huge loss to residents.

It is time the powers that be wake up to the reality and initiate concrete measures to avoid recurrence of such developments.

CP plunges into action

Cyberabad Commissioner of Police Vishwanath Channappa Sajjanar has walked the talk and plunged into action when Hyderabad was battered by unprecedented rains.

The tough training he got at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy has come in handy once again for this 1996 batch IPS officer.

His readiness to jump into action has been proved time and again while the society is getting better and better. The recent rains showed the sharpness of the officer rescuing marooned citizens reaching them to safety.

An action photograph of Mr. Sajjanar helping the needy caught in swirling waters went viral on social media and it became the talk of the town.

Pouring out

People poured out their woes as politicians neglected their misery. Residents of Uppal constituency lashed out at their MLA Bethi Subhas Reddy for not providing them any relief when he ‘toured’ the inundated areas in a boat.

In a video, which went viral on social media, a woman was seen talking to him from her balcony. She asked Mr. Reddy if they should stay alive or die. “If you don’t do justice, we will write your name and die.” she threatened. The MLA tried to convince the woman and later picked up an argument with her.

Between the devil and deep sea!

TRS politicians, including GHMC corporators and MLAs of constituencies in Hyderabad and its surrounding areas, and ministers are facing a test of their political nerve as people are staring at the worst-ever problem of flooding for decades. Devastated by the unprecedented impact of flooding on their lives, residents of affected localities are venting their emotions (anger) on these elected representatives, particularly those of the ruling party, who are visiting the areas to examine the damage, oversee relief work and console them.

“Forced to a corner by nature’s ire and man-made conditions, the affected people are left with nothing literally and have no option but to question the rulers. On their part, the politicians too have no option but to visit the affected people, although the situation very much resembles like getting caught between the devil and deep sea, ahead of GHMC elections,” a retired bureaucrat lamented.

277,2020/10/19,Sada bainama regularisation till Oct. 31,"Govt. had decided to exempt small/marginal farmers with land up to five acres from payment of stamp duty

The State government has decided to accept applications for regularisation of Sada Bainamas (land transactions on plain paper) till October 31.

The development follows an assurance given by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao during the recent Assembly session that the government was not averse to give one last opportunity for regularisation of these transactions. Accordingly, the district collectors had been asked to personally monitor the submission of claims Form-X for regularisation.

The regularisation process would be taken up under Section 22 (2) of Telangana Rights in Land and Pattadar Passbooks Rules read with Section 5(A) of Telangana Rights in Land and Pattadar Passbooks Act, 1971. Land transactions done till June 2, 2014, would be considered for regularisation.

The regularisation process would be applicable for transactions related to agricultural lands in rural areas. It would not be applicable for lands under the HMDA, Kakatiya Urban Development Authority, municipal corporations and municipalities.

The government had decided to exempt small/marginal farmers with land up to five acres from payment of stamp duty. Regularisation in respect of large farmers with more than five acre land would be done only on payment of stamp duty and registration fee.

Farmers opting for regularisation of their Sada Bainamas should submit a copy of the Aadhaar card, Sada Bainama document scanned and uploaded, pattadar passbook copy of buyer/seller if available and any other documentary proof as required.

Applicants should also collect the acknowledgement from Mee Seva centres as proof of submission of documents.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/sada-bainama-regularisation-till-oct-31/article32888343.ece
278,2020/10/19,"Irrigation engineers told to be on their toes for dam, network safety","With another heavy rain forecast and recent pump house flooding, supervisory officers told to be in their headquarters

With another spell of heavy rain forecast for the catchment areas of Krishna and Godavari rivers and their tributaries at least for five days from Monday, the State government has instructed engineers of irrigation department to step up vigil on the installations and told the supervisory officers/engineers to be in their headquarters.

The instructions assume significance in the wake of flooding of the Kalwakurthy Lift Irrigation Project (LIP) pump house at Yellur in Nagarkurnool district on Friday, making the facility non-functional and forcing farmers and people depending on water pumped from it into uncertainty over their irrigation and drinking water needs.

In the instructions issued to all superintending, executive, deputy executive and assistant executive engineers of irrigation units, the government asked them to be in their headquarters so that they could take all precautionary measures in advance to safeguard the irrigation network in their purview.

“Their responsibility is to see that all the rain water is safely discharged into the downstream network and to report any damage within 24 hours of occurrence indicating nature of the damage, estimating the amount required for temporary repairs and funds needed for permanent restoration,” a senior officer of the department stated. Besides, they are also supposed to make a detailed report to the government on the damage.

In case any officer/engineer was found to be not following the instructions issued by the government, it would be the responsibility of the superior officer to report the same to the government for initiating action against those indulging in dereliction of duties, the source said.

With the prolonged flood season still active, the authorities of Nagarjunasagar dam, one of the two common reservoirs of Telugu states managed by Telangana, has taken up round-the-clock patrolling of the dam and its systems, including posting deputy executive engineers (DEEs) on night duties on turn basis.

“It is being done to ensure proper watch over the dam safety and patrolling during the night until the water level recedes to 570 feet against the full reservoir level of 590 feet being maintained for about a couple of months now,” the officer said, adding that a total of 18 DEEs have been drawn for patrolling duties till the month-end.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/irrigation-engineers-told-to-be-on-their-toes-for-dam-network-safety/article32888333.ece
279,2020/10/19,BJP wants Centre to order CBI probe into irrigation projects,"TRS government accused of swindling funds in the name of design changes’

BJP national vice-president D.K. Aruna on Sunday wrote a letter to the Centre to order a CBI probe into irrigation projects’ irregularities in Telangana and charged the TRS government of “swindling funds in the name of design changes”.

Addressing a press conference, she hit out at the KCR government for ignoring the Palamuru-Ranga Reddy project and attributed the submergence of Vellur pump house under Kalwakurty project followed by a blast to “official negligence”. That the government did not allow the Opposition leaders to visit the site and used the police to thwart their visit showed it had something to hide, she claimed.

The government had disregarded the engineers’ advice and that has led to the submergence of the pump house, she alleged, and expressed the confidence the Central government would allow the CBI to probe into the irrigation projects “to unravel facts behind the omissions and commissions”.

Ms. Aruna alleged that both the Palamuru-Ranga Reddy and Chevella Pranahitha names and designs were changed to “mint money” and accused Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of “confining himself to the farm house when people were facing difficulties due to floods and crops damage”.

The former Minister also ridiculed KCR and KTR of claiming to have spent hundreds of crores of rupees for the twin cities’ development and wondered where the funds went. While the city administration disregarded weather warnings and could not take up repairs of storm water drains or remove encroachments, the government had also failed to come to the rescue of farmers on various counts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/al3jdh/article30259276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10ARUNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bjp-wants-centre-to-order-cbi-probe-into-irrigation-projects/article32888331.ece

About 142 social and 48 tribal welfare residential students fought their way out of poverty and secured top All India ranks in SC/ST categories in NEET 2020 on Saturday.

These are children of beedi workers, small farmers, agricultural labourers, tea sellers, vegetable vendors, mechanics, cooks, masons, auto drivers, housemaids, watchmen and peons.

Dejavath Girija, a tribal girl from ‘Operation Emerald’ coaching programme being run by the Telangana Tribal Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TTWREIS), secured all India 85 rank in ST category. She is likely to get admission into the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

G. Abhilash, who secured 168 All India rank in SC category, said, “My parents are the happiest people to see me as a doctor and I can’t thank Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao more for his approval for free intensive long-term NEET coaching for poor students like me.”

“The success of these students from poverty stricken families means a lot to their families in overcoming generations of deprivation and under development,” says an elated secretary of TSWREI and TTWREI Societies R.S. Praveen Kumar. He congratulated the toppers and said that the entire credit goes to teachers for their hard work and going an extra mile in fulfilling the aspirations of underprivileged students.

Earlier, less than five students used to secure seats in medical colleges every year but the transformation has come about in the last few years as about 108 SC/ST students joined medical colleges last year.

281,2020/10/19,Had warned of Kalwakurthy pump house flooding in 2016 itself: Vamshi Chand,"AICC secretary Challa Vamshi Chand Reddy blamed the TRS government for the submergence of pump house at Kalwakurthy Lift Irrigation Project, saying that he had warned of such an accident in the Assembly in 2016 itself.

He said the accident was due to the redesigning of the Palamuru-Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Scheme (PRLIS) and had cautioned about the impending dangers in 2016 itself on the floor of the Assembly.

However, the government went ahead with the redesigning of the pump house of the PRLIS by considering the report from its departmental committee that included even a contractor as one of its members while three other committees had rejected the redesign.

He said Penta Reddy, who was felicitated as the father of lift irrigation projects by Chief Minister K. Chandrasehkar Rao and then Irrigation Minister Harish Rao, had also cautioned and warned the government not to go ahead with the redesigning.

Even the steering committee had called it a futile approach both technically and economically in June 2016 and warned of the difficulties to be faced in case the project was executed.

The re-design proposal was declined not only by the steering committee but also by a joint steering committee. But with an intention to grab commissions, contractors along with the government had gone ahead with the re-designing disregarding all the committee reports given by several irrigation experts, he alleged.

283,2020/10/19,Nine Bangladeshis chargesheeted,"The accused established prostitution rackets in various parts of the country

The National Investigation Agency on Saturday filed a charge sheet against 12 people, including nine Bangladesh nationals, in an international human trafficking racket operating from Hyderabad, in a special court here.

The case was initially registered on September 21, 2019 at Pahadi Shareef police station of Rachakonda Commissionerate, following the arrest of 10 human traffickers from two brothels at Jalpally village and Mahimood Colony in Balapur on the outskirts of the city.

Four young Bangladeshi girls were rescued from the brothels and several digital devices, fake Indian identity documents and other incriminating material were seized.

Following the cross-border links in the case, the agency registered a fresh case on December 12, 2019 and launched a probe.

The investigators found that the arrested accused were associates of Ruhul Amin Dhali and Abdul Barik Sheikh, who illegally trafficked young girls from Bangladesh to India and vice versa.

Ruhul Amin Dhali was already arrested by NIA on December last in another case. Further, the investigation revealed that there were money transfers between Ruhul Amin Dhali and Abdul Barik Shaik as commission paid to the former for trafficking across the borders.

“Ruhul Amin Dhali and other 10 arrested accused had illegally entered India in 1980s and established a prostitution racket along with Yusuf Khan and Bithi Begum (husband and wife) in various parts of India,” NIA officials said.

They said that the 12 accused hatched a conspiracy along with their associates in Bangladesh to look for young Bangladeshi girls in the age-group of 19 to 25 years and traffic them to India by crossing Sonai river to Kolkata and then shift them to various destinations in the country, including Mumbai and Hyderabad.

“These girls are lured with the promise of lucrative jobs and better quality of life in India. They are also provided fake Indian identity documents and are eventually forced into prostitution,” the officials said.

The rescued young girls are presently in shelter homes in Hyderabad and the arrested accused are in judicial custody.

Those chargesheeted are Abdul Barik Shaik from Bangladesh, who is currently absconding, Ruhul Amin Dhali from West Bengal, Asad Hasan from Maharashtra, Mohd Yousuf Khan, Bithi Begum, Mohd Rana Hussain, Mohammed Al Mamun, Sojib Shaik, Suresh Kumar Das, Mohd Abdulla Munshi, Mohd Ayub Shaik from Bangladesh and from Bangladesh, and Shareeful Shaik of Maharashtra.

284,2020/10/19,Two Maoists killed in Mulugu,"Joint patrolling party comes under fire from squad of armed Maoists leading to an exchange of fire

Two unidentified Maoists were killed in an ‘exchange of fire’ with the police in Mulugu district on Sunday afternoon, police said.

The face-off took place at Musalammagutta forest area under Mangapeta police station limits in the tribal-dominated district. This is the fifth such encounter in recent months. The incident escalated tension in the restive forest region straddling the Telangana-Chhattisgarh border. It comes more than a week after ultras stabbed to death TRS party activist 48-year-old M. Bheemeshwara Rao in Bodhapuram village in the Agency mandal of Venkatapuram in the same district on October 10.

Acting on specific information about the movement of Maoist action teams, a special party police team along with the Greyhounds forces launched a combing operation in Musalammagutta forest area on Sunday, police sources said. The joint patrolling party came under fire from a squad of armed Maoists that led to an exchange of fire, police added. During a search after the exchange of fire, the police found two bodies of unidentified Maoist male cadres at the scene of ‘exchange of fire’.

The CPI (Maoists) suffered a series of setbacks while attempting to gain foothold in Agency areas of Telangana in the recent past. As many as eight of its cadres were killed in four separate “encounters” — six in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district and two in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district — since September first week. The rebels observed a bandh in Bhadrachalam Agency on September 28 in protest against what they termed as “fake encounter killings” of its cadres.

The spurt in Maoist activities in Agency areas prompted the top brass of the State police to hold a high-level coordination meeting on joint anti-Maoist strategy with their counterparts of Chhattisgarh and senior officials of the CRPF in Venkatapuram in the border district of Mulugu on October 4.

The Venkatapuram police on Saturday arrested a Maoist militia member, who was allegedly involved in the recent murder of TRS cadre Bheemeshwara Rao, at Kondapuram village and seized some explosive materials from his possession.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/two-maoists-killed-in-mulugu/article32888001.ece

The girl’s father Mohammed Imran, an autorickshaw driver, was not at home when the incident took place around midnight 12 a.m. on Sunday, Mangalhat inspector G. Ranaveer Reddy said. She was caught in the debris and breathed her last, while her mother and siblings escaped with minor injuries.

“When his wife Feroza alerted him about the incident, Imran rushed to his house and with the help of neighbours they removed the debris and shifted Abida to the Osmania General Hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead,” Mr. Reddy said. The Mangalhat police have registered a case under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

At Jubilee Hills, a four-year-old boy K. Siddhu drowned in a pit filled with rainwater at an open plot near his house. The pit was dug for pillars.

K. Siddhu, a resident of Durga Bhavani Nagar, was playing outside his house when the incident took place, Jubilee Hills inspector K Sattaiah said.

288,2020/10/19,Transport Authority for Kochi this month: Minister,"Cabinet set to decide on board members of KMTA in the coming days

The State government is making all-out efforts to ensure that the Kochi Metropolitan Transportation Authority (KMTA) begins functioning this month itself, while space for its office would be finalised this week, Minister for Transport A.K. Saseendran, has said.

Speaking to The Hindu, he said that the State Cabinet was expected to decide on the board members of the authority in the coming days. The file in this regard had been forwarded to the Chief Minister. Kochi would have the first such full-fledged authority in India, to formulate which a Bill was passed two years ago. Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode were set to follow suit. Other cities too could subsequently opt for similar bodies which would be in charge of the coordination, execution, regulation, and supervision of urban transport systems, he said.

The authority chaired by the Minister for Transport, would have the Transport Secretary as Vice Chairman. The board members would comprise the Mayor, a people’s representative nominated by the government, a couple of traffic experts, and officials representing the departments concerned. It was heartening to note that Kochi was leading the State in initiating changes in public transport, as was evident from the fact that private bus operators here had arrayed under half a dozen companies, while autorickshaw drivers had together formed a cooperative society, Mr. Saseendran said.

The Enforcement RTO of Ernakulam had been appointed the nodal officer to identify a fully furnished office for the KMTA. Among the suggestions that came forth was space in the Revenue Tower on Park Avenue Road. The KMTA would wield considerable powers, aimed at streamlining public transport systems, it is learnt.

The constitution of the Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) had found a place in the 100-day action plan of the State government, announced in August. The government is shortly expected to finalise the body’s rules and notify them. The authority is initially expected to take a call on rationalising bus routes, to ensure optimal fleet efficiency of private and KSRTC buses. It would also have to evolve a parking policy, to encourage opening of pay and park lots and measures to clamp down on haphazard parking, among other issues that are crying for attention.

Mr. Saseendran said the MVD’s Suraksha Mithra software would shortly be linked with Kochi’s Integrated Command and Control Communication Centre (IC-4), whose MVD cell he inaugurated online on Monday. This would enable monitoring of emergency vehicles, public transport and school buses.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/efn5ql/article31159710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Copyof22CTBIG0V75DR0S6jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/transport-authority-for-kochi-this-month-minister/article32895601.ece

295,2020/10/19,Walayar case | High Court to hear appeal in November,"State concedes there were lapses in the investigation of the crime and trial,

Kerala government has informed the High Court that it was willing to reinvestigate the sexual abuse and deaths of two minor sisters of Walayar.

The State made its position clear before the court while seeking an early hearing for the appeal filed against the acquittal of the accused by a trial court. The State also conceded that there were lapses in the investigation of the crime and its trial.

Accepting the submission of the State, the High Court has decided to consider the appeal from November 9. The mother of the deceased children and the State government had filed appeals against the trial court order in November. It was in March this year that the court considered the case last.

The acquittal of the accused had generated a hue and cry in the State with various political parties and organisations coming out against what they termed as the tardy police investigation and inefficient prosecution.

A judicial commission appointed by the State government had found that the prosecutors in the case failed to truly and faithfully utilise proof gathered during probe. The lapses of the two prosecutors during the trial of the sexual abuse and death case of two sisters had swayed the verdict in the sensational case, the commission found out.

P. K. Haneefa, the judicial commission, who probed the lapses in the investigation and prosecution of the cases, also blasted the police for the tardy investigation during the early stage and recommended action against a police Sub- Inspector.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ipri7w/article29916773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvpt-mahilaassn,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/walayar-case-high-court-to-hear-appeal-in-november/article32892424.ece
296,2020/10/19,CM launches Intelligent Traffic Management System in Kochi,"The project will boost seamless mobility in the region which already has the metro rail, private bus companies and an autorickshaw cooperative society.

The ₹27 crore Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) to streamline traffic movement and help enforce traffic rules in the Greater Kochi area is yet another feather on the cap of Kochi's transport system, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said, after inaugurating it online on Monday.

The impending taking effect of Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) and also the expected commissioning of Water Metro (in January 2021) will take forward the cause of seamless mobility in the region which already has the metro rail, private bus companies and an autorickshaw cooperative society to be proud of. That ITMS relies on night-vision cameras will ensure rule enforcement round the clock, he added.

An initiative of Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML), Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation (Keltron) installed the high resolution CCTVs and other equipments needed for the project. Automated enforcement will help identify traffic-dense corridors and vehicles moving in that direction will be given preferance. It will also enable automated rule enforcement, whereby incudents like motorists juming signals will be automatically challaned.

He also unveiled CSML's e-health solutions project, which would store data on health of patients, among a host of other functions. Ernakulam General Hospital is among the eight Government hospitals that will be covered under this.

297,2020/10/19,‘Chiri’ exposes mobile phone addiction of children,"The police initiative aims to ensure emotional well-being of children in pandemic times

Chiri, a helpline-driven initiative of the police for the emotional and psychological well-being of children hit hard by the pandemic, has thrown up mobile phone addiction as one of the major issues among children in the district.

Though predominantly meant for assisting children, anxious parents are increasingly ringing up to share their distress over their wards’ obsession with mobile phones.

“Many parents seek ways to address the problem, while many of them request us to ring back and talk to their children without revealing the fact that they had alerted us. We do that feigning to have received their numbers through some survey being done to make up for the absence of school-level counselling, though some still decline to talk,” said Viju Rajesh, a psychologist engaged as part of the district-level core team of Chiri.

Hyper-aggressive children and girls trapped in affairs through social media are some of the major concerns of parents aired through the facility. Since its inception nearly three months ago, Chiri has received 5,800 calls from across the State, with Ernakulam accounting for 430 calls.

Children do call with diverse demands. One youngster from Vallarpadam rues over his house’s tin roof and absence of power, which were addressed by the local police. Another youngster from Muvattupuzha complained about not having enough books to read, as the school library remained closed, and the police arranged books from a local library.

“Left with their own frustrations, parents these days take it out on children on the slightest of provocations, making their lives difficult. The issue is further exacerbated by the absence of schools, where their problems used to be identified and solved,” said P.S. Shabu, assistant nodal officer for Student Police Cadet (SPC) programme in Ernakulam rural.

Calls to the helpline (94979-00200) are directed to the State facility, which forwards them to the districts concerned, where there are core teams comprising a psychiatrist, psychologist, 15 SPCs, and three teachers associated with SPC.

SPCs fill the role of peers with whom children in distress may open up freely. “Sixty-odd children, seven from Ernakulam rural alone, have died by suicide for the flimsiest of reasons since the lockdown. We want to inspire confidence in children that we are here to help them,” said Mr. Shabu.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/y3426t/article32888890.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mobileaddictki19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/chiri-exposes-mobile-phone-addiction-of-children/article32888891.ece
298,2020/10/19,City gas to be made available in all taluks,"Pipeline to be extended to Angamaly, Perumbavoor, and Kolenchery

The city gas supply will be made available in all taluks of Ernakulam district. A gas pipeline has been laid from Karingachira via Kundannur and Edappally to Aluva.

It has been decided to extend the pipeline to Angamaly, Perumbavoor, and Kolenchery. The groundwork has started in all the six municipalities, said a press release here.

At present, gas is supplied to 2,500 houses in Thrikkakara Municipality. Plumbing work has been completed in 1,500 houses. In addition to nine CNG stations, work is in progress at Willingdon Island, Kalady, Perumbavoor, and Poothotta. Municipalities that have not granted permission for the project have been directed to take a decision within 21 days, the release added.

With the implementation of the scheme, natural gas will be available round-the-clock at every household, without interruption. It will be 30% cheaper than conventional fuel.

In addition to domestic consumers, CNG vehicles as well as commercial and industrial consumers will benefit from the scheme. The use of gas in CNG vehicles reduces air pollution. It is also safer to use natural gas, as its density is much lower than that of other cooking gases.

Bills will have to be paid according to the meter reading. For domestic consumers, the rate is ₹752.92 per MMBTU (Metric Million British Thermal Unit). The rate is ₹850.33 per unit for commercial customers and ₹720.72 per unit for industrial customers. The rate for CNG consumers is ₹57.30 per kg. The average monthly consumption of natural gas for a family of four is estimated at 0.4 units, which translate to a monthly expenditure of ₹300.

Natural gas reaches the GAIL gas pipeline from the Petronet LNG terminal at Puthuvype. GAIL supplies natural gas to the Indian Oil Adani Gas Pvt. Ltd. (IOAGPL) pipeline from the valve station at Kalamassery. IOAGPL then delivers gas to customers through steel pipelines.

IOAGPL has been licensed to supply natural gas in Ernakulam district in the fourth bidding round of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB). Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kannur, Kasaragod, Kozhikode and Wayanad districts have been approved in the ninth bidding round.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/di4qdq/article32888870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19-KI-CITY-GAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/city-gas-to-be-made-available-in-all-taluks/article32888871.ece
299,2020/10/19,Bank rapped for initiating recovery steps after loan repayment,"Ernakulam District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum awards compensation to complainants

Coming down heavily on a public sector bank for initiating recovery proceedings for an education loan that was repaid, the Ernakulam District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum has directed the Kalamassery branch of the State Bank of India to pay a customer ₹10,000 as compensation.

The directive came on a complaint filed by M.A. Janardanan and his daughter. According to them, they had availed an education loan of ₹73,500 from the branch of the erstwhile State Bank of Travancore in 2006. The entire loan was repaid after settling the outstanding amount at an adalat in April 2016. However, one month after fully paying the outstanding amount, they got a legal notice from the bank, asking them to pay the outstanding amount within 10 days, failing which recovery steps would be initiated. The then branch manger had refused to acknowledge the loan repayment receipt and abused them, alleged the complainants. Besides, the bank withdrew a sum of ₹1,500 that remained in the account of the daughter.

The forum led by its President Cherian K. Kuriakose said it was unable to justify the act of the bank, especially when the loan was sanctioned and availed of by the complainants as an educational loan which was a priority project of the Central government. The negligence on the part of the branch manager in refusing to recall the recovery proceedings initiated immediately after the entire payment was tantamount to deficiency in service.

The forum further observed the bank that had substantial infrastructure and was equipped with the latest technology to identify the money flow had not taken care of the payment made to the account and had issued a threatening recovery notice.

The bank manger contended that even as the loan was settled, the loan account had been “procedurally escalated to the recovery cell” of the bank. The allegation that he had abused and threatened the complainants was incorrect. The complaint was a fabricated one to extort money, the bank argued.

The forum also directed the bank manger to pay the complainants ₹5,000 towards litigation cost.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/bank-rapped-for-initiating-recovery-steps-after-loan-repayment/article32888821.ece
300,2020/10/19,"With migrant workers returning, pineapple farmers look forward to better times","40% of migrant workforce back in the fields; prices improve with rise in demand

With about 40% of the estimated 25,000 migrant workers in the sector back in pineapple fields, farmers are looking ahead to better times after what many described as the worst slump in business triggered by the COVID-19 lockdown, a price crash and the flight of thousands of migrant workers from the State.

The crash in prices, lost crop and the near inability of the farmers to recoup their losses forced K.K. Anil, a pineapple farmer at Ayavana near Muvattupuzha, to commit suicide on August 21, leading to a wave of protests.

About 20% of the workers who manned pineapple fields had returned, strengthening the already available 20% who had not gone home in the wake of the pandemic, said Baby John, a veteran farmer and president of the Pineapple Growers’ Association. He said that about 20% of the remaining labour requirement was met by local hands, especially women who were skilled in the work.

The near normalisation of field work coupled with improvement in price has helped pineapple farmers overcome the feeling of gloom triggered by the pandemic. The best quality fruit fetched ₹25 to ₹26 a kg at present, said Mr. John, and pointed out that the demand in north Indian cities in the festive week of Navaratri had resulted in the price moving up.

However, the Vazhakkulam pineapple market is seeing depleted arrival. Fruit arrival has dwindled to about 50%, but the normalisation of the road transport network is helping move the fruit to places such as Mumbai and Delhi.

At the same time, heavy rain in north India has dampened demand to some extent even as continuing rains triggered by the retreating monsoon and frequent development of depression in the Bay of Bengal have impacted the seasonal activities in Kerala’s pineapple fields.

Farmers are, however, not out of the woods yet with an estimated total loan exposure of ₹450 crore for the sector. The State produces around 5.4 lakh tonnes of pineapple a year from about 18,000 hectares. The average turnover is ₹1,250 crore per year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/f847kd/article32890150.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PINEAPPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/with-migrant-workers-returning-pineapple-farmers-look-forward-to-better-times/article32888809.ece

The Kochi Corporation has approached Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran seeking repair of PWD roads in the city.

The move comes in the wake of the Kerala High Court pulling up the civic body for the poor upkeep of roads.

In her letter to the Minister, Mayor Soumini Jain sought his intervention to repair the roads owned by the PWD, including Park Avenue Road and the one that runs next to Indira Gandhi Cooperative Hospital. These important roads, pointed out Ms. Jain, were in a very poor condition.

Incidentally, the High Court had on Friday criticised the civic body for what it termed as its casual attitude towards repairing city roads. Craters and potholes on the roads could cause accidents, leading to loss of lives, the court reminded.

It had also highlighted the condition of the road in front of its main office at Park Avenue. The court noted that despite its order for making the contractors and engineers of the corporation personally responsible for the condition of the road, the corporation remained deaf, blind, and mute.

The court had also directed the Corporation Secretary to personally appear before it on October 21 to explain the condition of the roads and to submit details of the contractors and engineers responsible for its upkeep.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/bad-roads-mayor-writes-to-minister/article32888763.ece
304,2020/10/19,"Bus, auto operators look up to CNG for succour","Pandemic spread results in steep fall in commuter patronage

At a time when e-mobility is gaining traction across the globe, operators of private buses and autorickshaws, already hit hard by the steep fall in commuter patronage due to the pandemic, are looking up to CNG and LNG to cut fuel bills.

Approximately, 5,000 of the total 27,000 autorickshaws that operate in the Greater Kochi area rely on CNG as fuel, a shift from diesel and petrol autos that occurred over a three-year period, said Simon Edappally, board member of Ernakulam Jilla Autorickshaw Drivers Cooperative Society. “The advantage is that it costs ₹55 per kg, cheaper than diesel. CNG-run autos also cause much less air and noise pollution. That the number of CNG refilling stations has increased to seven in Kochi city has resulted in more takers for these autos,” he added.

The roll-out of e-autos in Kochi has been hit by the COVID-induced slowdown and inadequate number of recharging stations. The cooperative society had inked agreements with three manufacturers to procure 1,000 e-autos. Efforts are under way to ink pacts with State-owned Kerala Automobiles Ltd (KAL), Mr. Simon said.

Plan to go for e-buses withheld

Private bus operators have temporarily withheld plans to go for e-buses, considering the huge capital investment — of around ₹1.50 crore per bus. “Most operators are willing to retrofit CNG kits in buses, if the government gives a subsidy or considerably lessens road tax. But each kit costs ₹4 lakh, which operators are unwilling to invest, considering the uncertainty clouding the public transport sector,” said K.M. Navas, secretary, Kerala Bus Transport Association (KBTA).

The prohibitive cost of diesel and low passenger patronage due to the pandemic have resulted in only 200 of the total 1,000 buses that operated in the Greater Kochi area conducting services now. Proactive measures by the government will help in getting idling buses back on track. Retrofitting CNG kits will in itself lessen daily fuel expense by around ₹1,000. This will be in addition to the considerable fall in pollution levels, he said.

A city-based private bus operator installed a CNG kit in his bus earlier this year, while another bus is getting ready for the process, it is learnt.

LNG as fuel

In the long run, bus operators prefer LNG to CNG as a fuel source, considering that it is cheaper than CNG. The main advantage LNG has over CNG is that fuel efficiency increases by more than double. The operators of the LNG terminal at Puthuvype must open retail outlets in the city, so that buses can considerably bring down their fuel bills, Mr. Navas said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cnxdc2/article32890182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-kerala-corona,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/bus-auto-operators-look-up-to-cng-for-succour/article32888741.ece
305,2020/10/19,"ITMS to streamline traffic movement, pull up erring motorists in Kochi","Traffic management system to be commissioned today

The commissioning of the Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) to streamline traffic movement and to aid in rule enforcement in the Greater Kochi area on Monday will see motorists indulging in rule violations being held accountable like never before.

The automated enforcement system would also help detect vehicles that defaulted in appearing for fitness test and paying of vehicle tax and insurance premium, said sources in the Motor Vehicles Department and the traffic police, the two key stakeholders engaged in traffic rule enforcement.

Vahan portal

“Already, the Vahan portal has all relevant and updated data of vehicles, except whether the vehicle has a valid pollution under control certificate. Offences, be it rash driving, not adhering to lane discipline (or zigzagging on the road), riding without helmet or seat belt, driving a car with tinted glasses or one with unauthorised alterations or improper registration number plates, will be tracked from the confines of the control room,” said a senior MVD official.

An initiative of Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML), the Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation (Keltron) installed the high resolution CCTVs and other equipment needed for the project.

The automated system relies on artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled cameras to keep track of rule violators and traffic pattern. This will considerably lessen the need for physical presence of enforcement personnel on roads. Details of vehicles registered in other States too can be kept tab of, by verifying with the Vahan portal. Challans will be generated for different offences and sent to the vehicle owner, who has to remit the fine and do remedial measures on the vehicle if it so warrants. Any non-payment of fine would result in the owner having to pursue the matter before the court, said official sources.

MVD interceptors

Meanwhile, the MVD is gearing up to intensify checking using four interceptor vehicles that it has in the district. The vehicles have modern equipment to scientifically verify offences. They include alcometer to ascertain whether a person is driving under the influence of alcohol, equipment to measure the transparency of windows or windshield, one to measure the intensity of headlights and decibel meter to measure the intensity of horns. The vehicles also have speed radar to nab motorists who exceed the speed limit.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/t3ggs7/article32888727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201018-WA0069,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/itms-to-streamline-traffic-movement-pull-up-erring-motorists-in-kochi/article32888728.ece

Anvar Ibrahim, 43, of Vadakara was part of a gang who befriended the businessman from Kozhikode and took him to a house in a remote area in Mysore in February 2019. The gang members posed as the prospective bride and her family.

They locked him in a room and clicked his pictures in a compromising position with the woman. Meanwhile, the other gang members, posing as police personnel, threatened and robbed him of ₹1 lakh and a watch. He was also made to sign three stamp papers, threatening that they would otherwise make him an accused in sexual assault and narcotics cases. He was later forced to part with ₹2 lakh. The third accused was arrested earlier.

The police are on the lookout for the other members of the gang.

Three persons arrested on charge of cylinder theft

Three persons were arrested in connection with the alleged theft of LPG cylinders from Azad Road, Kaloor, on Sunday.

The Ernakulam North police arrested Shiron Bachu, 37, of Palarivattom; Bennet, 54, Mamangalam, and Abdul Wahid, 41, of Thammanam. They have been charged with making away with gas cylinders kept on the road, which were to be supplied to customers.

An inquiry based on CCTV visuals revealed that Bennet and Shiron were involved in the theft. Abdul Wahid bought the cylinders knowing that they had been stolen, the police said.

308,2020/10/19,Kolkata thumbs nose at COVID-19 safety protocols as crowds throng Puja pandals,"Calcutta High Court directs all pandals be treated as no-entry zones

They say a picture speaks a thousand words, but one particular picture from Sunday, circulating on social media, has nothing left to say. It shows a lane leading to a Durga Puja pandal packed with mask-wearing people, several of them are clicking selfies. In the foreground is a man carrying his child — the boy’s mask is in place but the father’s mask sits way below the nose.

Many such crowd pictures emerged from the ‘City of Joy’ on Sunday, when West Bengal recorded not only the highest number of daily COVID-19 cases — 3,983 — but also the highest number of deaths, 64. Come to think of it, Durga Puja has not even officially begun: it traditionally begins on the sixth of the nine days that precede Dussehra and Sunday was only Day 2.

It was, therefore, not surprising when on Monday, the Calcutta High Court directed that all pandals be treated as no-entry zones. It remains to be seen how effectively the court directive is implemented, considering that pandal-hopping has already been set into motion, and with Assembly elections around the corner, the last thing the State Government would want is restricting the celebrations.

If anyone is worried at the moment, it’s mainly the doctors. Eventually, the responsibility will be theirs to deal with a surge in the number of cases, which appears imminent because that’s exactly what happened in Kerala, where the number of COVD-19 patients rose by 750% after Onam celebrations. And Durga Puja takes place on a far bigger scale than Onam.

“Shock. Horror. Apprehension. Sadness. Deeply worried,” this is how Dr. Arjun Dasgupta — a highly-regarded doctor in the city and a founding member of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum — summed up his reaction to the pictures to The Hindu.

And if there’s anyone that doesn’t seem too worried, it’s the State government. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who first said that she would be inaugurating the Puja in various neighbourhoods virtually, is now busy cutting the ribbon at various prominent pandals. This change in mind has only emboldened the public: if the Chief Minister can visit the pandals, then it must be safe for them, too.

When asked what exactly made people crowd pandals in spite of the high risk of contracting the virus, Prof. Bula Bhadra, a well-known sociologist, said: “It is the same mentality that led to the laying of the foundation of the Ram Temple at Ayodhya at the time of the pandemic. People get the government they deserve. Both, the people and the governments, are not being responsible.”

According to her, the country went for a lockdown when it did not have to, and lifted the lockdown when it should not have. She also added that it was highly insensitive on part of the people to be out celebrating when a large number of people had died due to COVID-19.

Never before has Kolkata been split in this fashion: while the mood in many neighbourhoods is muted this year, the mood in many others is upbeat as ever, as if nothing has happened. COVID-19, however, will not recognise the boundaries between the localities that are being cautious and those that aren’t.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/tt52rt/article32892870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DURGAPUJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/kolkata-thumbs-nose-at-safety-protocols-as-crowds-throng-puja-pandals/article32892775.ece
309,2020/10/19,Coronavirus | No visitors allowed inside Durga Puja pandals across West Bengal: Calcutta High Court,"Only Puja committee organisers can enter, in numbers ranging from 15 to 25

No visitors will be allowed inside Durga Puja pandals across West Bengal, and the Puja mandap will be treated as a “containment zone” this year, the Calcutta High Court said in an order on Monday.

A Division Bench of Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Arijit Banerjee said that only organisers of the Durga Puja committees can enter pandals in numbers ranging from 15 to 25. “No Entry” notices should be put up near the pandals this year, and an awareness drive should be taken up to inform people about the High Court’s order, the Bench said.

Hearing a public interest litigation on the issue of Durga Pujas being allowed in the State during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Court observed that the police does not have enough resources to control the crowd if people descend on the streets.

“The Calcutta High Court said that small Durga Puja pandals of five metres and large puja pandals of 10 metres should be declared a no-entry zone. The distance will have to be measured from the place where the boundary of Durga Puja pandal ends,” Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, advocate appearing for the petitioner, said.

Also read: Kolkata caught between festivities and fear of COVID-19

The Court also directed that the names of Durga Puja organisers allowed inside puja pandal be displayed outside the pandal, and this cannot be changed every day.

The Court also expressed disappointment that the State government had not come up with a plan to implement the guidelines issued earlier. The Court has asked the State government to submit a report on the matter on November 5.

The order assumes huge significance as there are about 37,000 Durga Pujas organised across the State despite warnings issued by doctors that crowding during the Durga Puja can worsen COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past few days, the State is recording a new spike in COVID-19 cases every day and more than 60 deaths.

Last week, the Calcutta High Court, in another significant order, had directed that the money allocated by the State government to Durga Puja can only be spent on distribution of masks, sanitisers and community policing, and not for organising the Durga Puja.

With 64 deaths, the State’s fatality count crossed the 6,000 mark to reach 6,056.

The State has added 1,000 deaths in just 18 days. The number of active cases has now increased to 33,927 while the discharge rate has dropped to 87.55%. The percentage of positive cases out of the samples tested has climbed to 8.04%.

Next week when the Durga Puja festivities will be at peak, experts have suggested that the number of COVID-19 infections might go up. There are about 37,000 community Durga Puja pandals in the State and nearly 3,000 of them are in Kolkata. Only a few pandals had heeded to the advice of doctors and said that they would not allow visitors. During the day, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also inaugurated a few puja pandals in the city.

Meanwhile, an open letter, posted in a public domain by the Joint Platform of Doctors West Bengal, had warned that if the celebrations during the Durga Puja were not controlled then post-festivities, there might be a tremendous rise in new cases.

“We had at first written to the CM and the Chief Secretary, and then to all political parties in this regard. But we have not got any reaction from them,” the letter said.

It pointed out that the rush for shopping and preparations is continuing undeterred, which can spell disaster for the people. “If the situation continues in this fashion then we can gauge how swiftly the number of cases will increase in the State… So many beds will not be available at the same time in the hospitals, nor will there be enough ventilators, doctors and health workers,” the letter said.

The seizure and the arrests were made on the basis of a specific intelligence developed by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB). The joint operation was conducted by the WCCB, the Baguihati police station, and the Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate. A case was registered at the Baguihati police station.

Several instances of seizure of ivory and other wildlife products have come to fore in Kolkata and Siliguri. Multiple agencies like the WCCB, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, wildlife wing of the Forest Department, and police have been involved in these seizures.

Pangolin scales, freshwater turtles, geckos, elephant tusks, rhino horns, tiger and leopard skins, and different species of birds are seized on almost a regular basis. While illegal wildlife trade has emerged as a form of organised trans-national crime in India, there have been seizures of highly threatened species like a lion cub and three white-headed langurs near Kolkata over the past few years raising questions on what role has the State to play in these smuggling activities.

They claimed that holding the exams right now might be risky. It was also pointed out that the guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission some time ago had recommended promoting them based on internal marks.

The district COVID control cell has issued an alert against the uptick in local transmission of the infection, pointing out that 87% of the total cases were through contact with already infected people.

The source of infection of six per cent of the patients was not known. Health Department officials said on Monday that those who ignored the warnings and guidelines related to COVID protocol were contributing to the rise in the number of new cases. The test positivity rate had gone up from 13.5% to 17.6% in a week.

Ninety eight per cent of the infected persons in the past two weeks were from villages. Some people were misusing the concessions given to those who were struggling without jobs and means of survival. This was adding momentum to the spread of the infection. Celebrations without any precautions were one of the many reasons for the rise in local transmission cases.

As many as 128 people, who belong to the Category B patients with mild symptoms, were going under observation every day. People who had primary contact with infected persons were reluctant to go into self-quarantine. This, along with throwing caution to the wind, was among the reasons for local transmission, the officials claimed.

They pointed out that of the 110 people who died in the district, 65% were aged above 75. Eight per cent of people had comorbidities, or other health problems. The rise in number of cases was necessitating a corresponding increase in the number of tests.

The Kozhikode District Wayside Vendors’ Federation has petitioned to the chairman of the wayside vending complaint redressal committee to take immediate steps to allow wayside vending in the district, as it has affected the livelihood of hundreds of people.

“Wayside vendors are generally from poor financial background. This is our only means of livelihood,” said M. Mohammed Basheer, secretary of the Federation, adding that most of them were now living in a state of utter poverty.

“The Kozhikode Corporation had allowed wayside vendors to do business. But the police did not agree and the permission was cancelled,” Mr. Basheer said.

The federation has appealed to the committee to direct the police and other authorities in the district to allow wayside businesses. “We are ready to follow the COVID protocol and any other restrictions.

319,2020/10/19,Reopening of Kozhikode beaches unlikely soon,"Increased number of containment zones along coastal belt a concern

Reopening of the district’s prominent beach tourism destinations is likely to be delayed further with the increased number of micro containment zones and vulnerable locations along the coastal belt. Tourism Department officials say they are finding it hard to propose effective screening measures in such locations to prevent the entry of persons with suspected COVID-19 symptoms.

Though the reopening of smaller destinations like Butt Road and South beach in the first phase with stringent crowd control measures is being considered, the district administration is yet to take a decision on it. Tourism Department officials say they cannot permit the opening of the Kozhikode beach from next month.

“Reopening of the Kozhikode beach can be recommended only if the existing situation improves. There is also practical difficulty in introducing effective screening measures for visitors by covering such a larger area,” says District Tourism Promotion Council Secretary Beena Madusoodanan.

Token system

Meanwhile, token system have been mooted in prime destinations like Kappad for permitting international and domestic tourists. Koyilandy MLA K. Dasan says it is crucial for supporting the ongoing tourism promotion activities.

“Kappad is now a blue-flag certified beach and we have to take advantage of it by adopting the best crowd control strategy,” he adds.

Beach destinations in the district have been remaining closed for over six months, leaving hundreds of pushcart traders and street food vendors in crisis.

Many are now surviving by doing other odd jobs as their entry to the spot has been discouraged as part of COVID-19 control measures.

321,2020/10/19,Poor quality food being served: COVID patients,"Beach hospital authorities accused of turning a blind eye to issue

A section of COVID-19 patients admitted to the Government General Hospital, Kozhikode, has accused the authorities of delaying their food and limiting its quantity. They reportedly went on a strike on Sunday raising these issues and threatened to venture out of the hospital on Monday morning if the person in charge of COVID treatment failed to address their concerns.

One of those patients told The Hindu that they were yet to meet the doctor in charge of COVID treatment. “We are being fed things that are given to animals. That too in such a limited quantity. The plates are being cleaned in unhygienic surroundings. None of the senior doctors have bothered to come here and address these issues,” he alleged.

He claimed that the patients there included senior citizens who are diabetic patients. They were being given breakfast after 9 a.m. and lunch after 2 p.m. “We demand permission to have the food prepared at home. If the issue is not sorted out by Monday morning, some of us will go out of the hospital and have food from places of our choice,” he added.

The hospital authorities, however, claimed that food being supplied is prepared by Kudumbashree units outside the hospital. There could be some delay in its transportation. Also, serving around 200-300 patients spread across different wards from one end to another end of the building was taking some time, they claimed.

Asked about the complaints over quantity and quality, they pointed out that the menu was chosen by the district administration.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/poor-quality-food-being-served-covid-patients/article32888339.ece

They staged a demonstration near the Collectorate in Madurai, urging the State government to provide compensation to the family of the 12-year-old girl, daughter of a hairdresser, who was raped and murdered in Dindigul.

The Dindigul Mahila Court had acquitted a suspect in the case, which sparked outrage among hairdressers across the State.

323,2020/10/19,Give one more opportunity to write exam: HC,"Considering the plea of a student pursuing Diploma in Civil Engineering, who failed to pay his arrear examination fees on time, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has asked the State to provide one more opportunity to not only the petitioner, but also similarly placed students to appear for the examination.

Justice S. Vaidyanathan observed that non-payment of examination fees was not deliberate and the government may provide one more ‘last opportunity’ not only to the petitioner but also to similarly-placed persons like the petitioner to appear for the examination, taking into account the COVID-19 situation.

It should be clearly stated that If they failed to avail the said opportunity, it will be a ‘lost opportunity.’ The grant of one more opportunity to write the examination is definitely better than ‘COVID Pass’ (all pass), the judge said and adjourned the hearing in the case to November 6.

The petitioner, K.R. Devadurai of Paramakudi, Ramanathapuram district, sought a direction to the Directorate of Technical Education to accept his examination fees to the arrear papers and permit him to write the examination. He had failed to pay the examination fees on March 10, which was the deadline.

Devadurai said that he did not pay the fees as he waited for the revaluation results. Since he did not come out successful in the revaluation, he immediately approached the authorities concerned in order to pay the necessary fees and write the examination. However, his request was not considered.

Special Government Pleader K.P. Krishnadoss submitted that it will be difficult to prepare the question paper and conduct examination for one person. If the request of the petitioner was entertained, there will be more such requests for the conduct of examination, he said and sought time to ascertain the possibility to permit the petitioner to write the examination.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/give-one-more-opportunity-to-write-exam-hc/article32894864.ece

Addressing union members, its Madurai divisional secretary J.M. Rafi said bonus for railway employees was first introduced in 1974 after a series of protests. “It is our right and we will not give it up at any cost,” he said.

Stating that the festival advance for Central government employees announced by the Centre was nothing new, he said that till VI central pay commission festival advance was given. Only in the VII CPC, it was removed. “The Centre says the festival advance will be given in the form of Ru Pay card. It wants us to spend the money so that it will get huge returns in the form of GST. Why should the Centre expect every worker to spend? We may like to pay school or college fees or repay loans. We might also save it for our future use,” he said.

326,2020/10/19,Agricultural workers to rise up against ‘injustices’ of the Centre,"‘Incidents of attack on dalits have increased under BJP rule’

All India Agricultural Workers’ Union (AIAWU) will unify agricultural workers, dalits and migrant labourers across the country for a mass movement in November third week condemning the Bharatiya Janata Party government’s attempts to create communal disharmony among people and against the passage of farm bills and labour laws, said its national president A. Vijayaraghavan here on Monday.

Addressing mediapersons, he said the Central government failed to ensure social security and livelihood security for agricultural workers, dalits and migrant labourers during the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown. It passed the Farm Bills without holding discussions with the standing committees.

The government’s procurement of agricultural produce from farmers and the distribution of commodities to the people through public distribution system (PDS) were interlinked. When the government procured agricultural produce from farmers, they were assured a minimum price for their commodities, and the distribution of commodities through PDS helped in addressing the issue of malnutrition in people, especially among children and women. “But, by passing the farm bills, the government is shying away from responsibility. This will severely affect the food security of the nation,” he said.

Incidents of attack on dalits had increased considerably under BJP rule, said Mr. Vijayaraghavan. “In the States ruled by the BJP government, the leaders have failed to protect the dalits and other minorities,” he said.

Employment opportunities of agricultural workers had been severely affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing additional employment through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Act (MGNREGA) was important, he said.

He said 200 days of work must be assured for workers under MGNREGA. “A minimum wage of ₹600 must be given for a day’s work under the job scheme,” he said.

“The Union government supports corporate conglomerates but is harsh on the working class through the labour laws. “So, all workers will unify to fight against these injustices,” he said. The Union would also take part in a nation-wide strike of all trade unions scheduled for November 26, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hiobe8/article32894508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20MACITY-NEW-VIJAYARAGHAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/agricultural-workers-to-rise-up-against-injustices-of-the-centre/article32894509.ece
327,2020/10/19,New Siddha concoction introduced at Aruppukottai GH,"‘Clinical trial has proved the kashayam is effective in controlling, curing coronavirus’

The State Health Department has permitted Aruppukottai Government Hospital to take up trial of a Siddha concoction on COVID-19 positive patients.

Virudhunagar Collector R. Kannan on Monday said clinical trial proved that the concoction – M.V. Kashayam – prepared using several herbs was effective in curing various symptoms of COVID-19.

“The Siddha drug has the power to prevent the spread of the virus in human body and also the power to wipe it out,” the Collector said.

The new drug was found to have the power to cure fever, body pain, allergy, breathing problems, ulcer, dysentery, cancer, and to protect liver and to improve immunity to cure anemia and give rejuvenation, he said in a statement.

Also, the trial had proved that it could prevent clotting of blood. “It is expected that COVID-19 can be cured on consuming M.V. Kashayam for three to six days,” Mr. Kannan said.

Upon taking the drug thrice, the viral load would be controlled and the adverse impact of COVID-19 would start to reduce.

“It is expected to provide relief to fever, headache, body pain, throat pain, cough and breathing trouble in two days,” the Collector said.

Since the drug could stop clotting of blood, it could prevent breathing trouble and heart attack, he added.

Stating that the new treatment was totally on trial basis at no cost, Mr. Kannan said that after treatment, laboratory test would be conducted on patients. Interested persons could avail the treatment on producing a COVID-19 positive certificate. A team of Siddha doctors would clear all doubts regarding the new drug.

The team of Siddha doctors comprised Dharumarajan, Venkateswaran, Vadivel, Chandramouli, Ezhil and others.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/new-siddha-concoction-introduced-at-aruppukottai-gh/article32894485.ece
328,2020/10/19,Congress to hold protests against Farm Act,"The law will cripple the public distribution system: TNCC chief

Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri on Monday said the party would hold demonstrations in all districts condemning the Central and State governments for introduction of the Farm Act.

The TN Youth Congress cadre had planned to hold a tractor rally in the district. However, police denied permission and warned that the tractors would be seized.

Condemning the police for the ‘threat’, Mr. Alagiri said the Congress wanted to express its protest in a democratic way. The denial by the police was not only autocratic but also against democratic norms.

Later, when the cadre assembled at Palanichettipatti and decided to march to Jawaharlal Nehru statue and garland it, police arrested the leaders including Mr. Alagiri, working president Mayura Jayakumar, AICC secretary Jebi Mether, Youth Congress president J.M. Hassan Moulana and Theni district Congress president Murugesan.

The cadre resorted to a road blockade in protest against the arrest. A large posse of police personnel was deployed in the vicinity to ensure that there were no untoward incidents.

Speaking to reporters, Mr. Alagiri said the Congress had implemented numerous programmes for the welfare of farmers in the country. However, the BJP brought in laws to wind up the agriculture sector.

He blamed the AIADMK government for supporting the Farm Act. The AIADMK leaders were interested only in power and did not care for farmers, he said.

Mr. Alagiri said the BJP was keen to support and protect select corporate houses in the country. Over a period of time, the Farm Act would cripple the public distribution system and the prices of essential commodities might go up.

The wrong policies of the Centre had destroyed BSNL, he added.

If the Centre was so keen to protect ryots, why did it not mention the minimum support price (MSP) in the Bill while tabling it in Parliament, he asked. Even when it was hurriedly sent for the President’s assent, the Congress members raised the omission inside and outside Parliament. The Prime Minister’s statement that the MSP was mentioned in the Act was misleading.

Very soon, there would be a change in the governments, he said and appealed to the cadre to be prepared to work towards a new regime.

The arrested leaders were released later in the evening, police said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/5i6x0g/article32894403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA20-TNCCCHIEF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/congress-to-hold-protests-against-farm-act/article32894404.ece
329,2020/10/19,‘Census of denotified tribes will bring about a change’,"Despite a Centre’s directive, it has not been started: forum

The Denotified Tribes Welfare Association has urged the government to complete the State-wide census for denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes (DNT, NT and SNT) before December 31, as the exercise would pave the way for the upliftment of these backward communities.

Its treasurer P. Thavamani Devi said the census was taken across the country based on a directive from the Union government. However, the State Backward Classes Commission was against this census, she charged. “The State government has not started the survey, despite the directive of the Central government. The delay will deeply affect the members of these communities,” she said.

This census was important as it would help identify the number of members of denotified communities present across the State. “It will help in ascertaining the educational, social and economical status of people belonging to the denotified communities. A clear picture will emerge on areas where the government needs to intervene for the upliftment of these people,” she said.

‘Boom boom maatukarargal,’ ‘Saattai Adippavar’ and Narikuravar were some of the nomadic tribes found in smaller numbers across the district. “They don’t have any certificate and don’t have a house to live in. There are very few graduates among them. The first generation graduates in these communities find it extremely difficult to get a job,” she said.

So it was all the more important to identify these communities and work towards their betterment, she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ndvdzm/article32894083.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20MACITY-DENOTIFIEDTRIBES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/census-of-denotified-tribes-will-bring-about-a-change/article32894084.ece

Justice S. Vaidyanathan observed that many officials such as Tahsildars, Surveyors, District Revenue Officers, Revenue Divisional Officers indulge in manipulation of records and amass wealth. Also, many District Registrars, Sub Registrars and their subordinates in the Registration Department indulged in ‘under the table’ dealings, the judge said.

Even though the proceedings were videographed, document writers were playing the role of agents to receive bribe. Officials of other government departments were also giving a stiff competition to the officials of the Revenue and Registration departments in receiving bribes, the judge observed in a strongly-worded order.

The court was hearing a petition filed by M. Senthil of Karur district who sought a direction to the Manmangalam Tahsildar to rectify the survey number in the patta assigned to him.

In the petition, the Sivagnanapuram villagers said farmers and villagers took water from Maruthaanikuttam tank for domestic and farming purposes even as a resolution passed in the gram sabha meeting says that none should take water for commercial purposes using pumps. However, an individual was pumping water from Maruthaanikuttam tank for commercial purposes despite resistance from the villagers.

“Even as the farmers are in need of water to save their standing turmeric crop, the individual, enjoying money and muscle power, takes water for commercial purposes, which should be stopped,” said Balaiah, head of Sivagnanapuram under Servaikaaranmadam village panchayat.

A group of Samaththuva Makkal Katchi cadre submitted a petition seeking early completion of the rail over bridge on Thoothukudi–Madurai Bypass Road. Since delay in construction of the bridge even after several years caused road accidents and claimed several lives, the Collector should take immediate steps.

Similarly, absence of traffic signal at the starting point of the four-way Madurai Highway beyond new bus stand caused frequent accidents. Hence, electronic signal should be installed at the point to regulate traffic and avert road accidents, the petitioners said.

Members of Tamil Nadu Vivasaayigal Sangam submitted a petition seeking immediate action by the Collector against installation of electric poles by windmill firms along cultivable lands in Pananchaalankurichi area without the consent of their owners. When the affected agriculturists raised objections, they were threatened by the companies with the backing of the police, they alleged.

A group of villagers from Chembur in Eral taluk submitted a petition against the move to close down the level-crossing in the village.

The petitioners said the gate was being used by the villagers to reach their places of work and the schools and the colleges. Since Southern Railway proposed to close down the gate permanently, it would force the Chembur villagers to take a circuitous route to reach their destinations.

A resolution passed in an all-party meeting held at the church with Rev. S. Antonysamy, Bishop of Palayamkottai RC Diocese, in chair said the attacks were conducted in an organised manner with the ulterior motive of triggering religious clash among the people.

Since the cemeteries were badly damaged and would require at least ₹30 lakh to repair them, the government should bear the cost, another resolution said.

The district administration and police should initiate the most stringent action against those who were working overtime to create animosity and clash between people of different faiths, the meeting said.

The Collector assured them of appropriate action.

Members of a few fringe outfits were objecting to burial of bodies in the 40-year-old cemetery saying it was situated close to a temple at Manimurtheeswaram.

Besides the granite cross atop the tombs, the polished granite tops on the graves also suffered damage. A portion of the compound wall around the cemetery was broken. The descretion triggered anger among Christians, particularly families who had their kin buried there.

Following Unlock 4.0, model Damodar Hegde moved from Bengaluru to the house of his cousin Ganesh Mulky Nayak, a motivational speaker, in the city, and the two decided to have fitness workout on the Tannirbhavi Beach from September 22 .

“As I was running on the beach, a piece of glass pierced my foot. As I removed it, I saw glass bottles, used syringes and other trash in the vicinity,” Mr. Hegde told The Hindu. And, this, he added, prompted the two to take up clearing debris on the beach. “We took up ‘removing trash’ as a fitness workout. With word of mouth and work featuring on social media, 50 volunteers have joined us,” Mr. Nayak said. A video by vloggers Mohammed Eshaaan and Shafaq, about this work on YouTube made more than 200 people turn up for cleaning activity on the beach on Sunday. Within two hours, trash on about a kilometre-long beach was cleared.

Every day, volunteers, who call themselves as “Beach Rejuvenation Army”, gather at 6.30 a.m. and start the activity by wearing face masks and gloves. They do it till 8 a.m. On the weekend, it goes on till 9 a.m. “Waste clearance is a continuous exercise. The deposit is more on days when it rains heavily,” Mr. Ganesh said.

The volunteers segregate trash at source. The discarded plastic bottles, slippers and other plastic items are filled in plastic bags and kept at the parking area for the waste collecting agencies to take them away. The wooden logs and coconuts are moved to a side of the beach. They have managed to move several heavy waste deposits created after waste material is entwined on discarded long ropes. “This cleaning work on the beach gives enough physical exercise,” said Suraj Prabhu, who recently finished engineering. “The exhaustion is so that I get a sound sleep when I hit the bed,” said Vishbhav, a sales marketing executive.It is a short video of the work posted by Mr. Hegde on his Instagram account that caught the attention of these volunteers who then joined Mr. Hegde and Mr. Nayak for cleaning.

340,2020/10/19,Drugs worth ₹ 73.39 lakh seized in three cases,"In a joint operation, the Udupi Police, in association with Internal Security Division of the State Police, Drugs Controller and Revenue officials, have seized drugs worth ₹ 73.39 lakh in three cases.

Superintendent of Police N. Vishnuvardhana said that four persons have been arrested in this connection. While one accused was from outside the State, the others were local residents.

He did not reveal the names of the arrested persons as further investigation is on.

He told reporters here on Saturday that three specialised teams headed by Additional Superintendent of Police Kumar Chandra carried out the three operations.

The technical, execution and investigation teams operated as per the operational brief and this has yielded the desired result. The police seized 1,019 MDMA tablets weighing 540 grams worth ₹ 30.57 lakh, 1,000 LSD stamps worth ₹ 30 lakh, 30 grams of brown sugar worth ₹ 3 lakh and 131 grams of superior quality hydro weed valued at ₹ 9.82 lakh

The Superintendent of Police said that the police were acting not just against drug peddlers but also against those consuming and transporting it.

The police have so far registered 209 cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act this year, which is highest in the last five years.

341,2020/10/19,‘Hosa adike’ prices shoot up in a fortnight,"With the market for “hosa adike” (fresh arrivals of chali variety of white arecanut) of the 2020-21 crop season opening this month, prices of the produce have shot up considerably during the last fortnight.

According to president, Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative (CAMPCO) Ltd., Mangaluru, S.R. Satishchandra, if the minimum price jumped up by ₹ 75 a kg, the maximum rate shot up by ₹ 55 a kg during the period.

For example, in the Badiyadka market, prices, which hovered between ₹ 225 a kg and ₹ 275 a kg on October 3, touched ₹ 300 a kg-330 a kg on Saturday. Prices in the other procurement centres of the cooperative were almost in the same range with a difference of ₹ 5 a kf or ₹ 10 a kg during the same period, he told The Hindu.

He attributed the jump in prices to various factors, mainly to supply and demand factor.

He said that there is shortage in arrivals due to reduced production.

As imports of arecanut are negligible since the lockdown due to COVID-19 issues, consuming market is entirely depending on domestic production.

Except large growers, small and marginal growers do not have stocks with them.

Mr. Satishchandra said that “kole roga” (fruit rot disease) which hit arecanut plantations on a vast scale in the 2018 and 2019 rainy season resulted in crop loss thus creating scarcity in the supply of old stocks. He said that an upward trend in prices might continue for some more days.

Ramesh Kaintaje, an arecanut grower and a member of G.V. Joshi Committee, which revised the production cost for arecanut, said that the prevalent prices for fresh arrivals are at an all-time high. Never in the past, prices of fresh arrivals jumped by more than ₹ 50 a kg in a fortnight just after the market for the new stocks opened, he said.

He said that even low grade “hosa adike” such as fator, ulli and karigot are commanding good prices now as never before. Their prices too have gone up. It indicated that the market demanded arecanut whatever may be the quality.

Quoting the Badiyadka market as saying, Mr. Kaintaje said that the maximum price for fator (nuts with cracks) jumped by ₹ 30 a kg to ₹ 255 a kg in a fortnight.

If prices of ulli jumped by ₹ 25 a kg, rate for karigot went up by ₹ 20 a kg during the period.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/kdjfeh/article32888605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19MNARECANUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/hosa-adike-prices-shoot-up-in-a-fortnight/article32888606.ece
342,2020/10/19,Video of Arebhashe talamaddale to go online soon,"A talamaddale, a variant of Yakshagana theatre, recorded for the first time in Arebhashe, a Kannada dialect spoken in parts of Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu and Kasaragod (Kerala), will be available on a social media platform shortly.

Arebhashe is spoken by a section of the Gowda community.

Recorded under the auspices of Karnataka Arebhashe Samskriti and Sahitya Academy, the Banada Pala Prasanga video recorded in Arebhashe will be uploaded on YouTube within the next 10 days, according to chairman of the academy Lakshminarayana Kajegadde. The performance lasts about two hours.

Banada Pala is the translated version of Yakshagana script “Sharasetubandhana” written by late Hattiyangady Rama Bhatta. Yakshagana bhagavatha (singer-cum-director) Bhavyashree Kulkunda has translated it into Arebhashe in the prosody suitable to it.

Mr. Kajegadde told The Hindu that Ms. Kulkunda has translated another script “Panchavati” written by Parthi Subba, considered as the father of Yakshagana, to Arebhashe on behalf of the academy. It is also for the talamaddale performance.

Ms. Kulkunda said that she is now fine tuning its script in Arebhashe in consultation with Ganesh Kolekkadi, an expert on prosody and Yakshagana script writer, and Subraya Sampaje, a Yakshagana bhagavatha. The two had guided her in translating the first script.

Mr. Kajegadde said that Ms. Kulkunda is now translating one more Yakshagana script Kamsa Vadhe written by Matti Vasudeva Prabhu to Arebhase suitable for Yakshagana performance. It is also for the academy.

In addition, the academy will get two more Yakshagana scripts translated into Arebhashe. Of them, one will be for talamaddale and the other for a Yakshagana performance.

Tentatively, it has identified Krishnarjuna Kalaga or Karnavasana scripts suitable for talamaddale and Indrajitu Kalaga as suitable for the Yakshagana performance. The scripts are yet to be finalised.

Thus, Mr. Kajegdde said that the academy will ensure that it had three scripts translated for talamaddale performance and two scripts suitable for performing Yakshagana. It will preserve those scripts and make them available to performers.

Ms. Kulkunda said that finding an appropriate word while translating Kannada Yakshagana songs into Arebhashe is a challenging task. The translation should also match with the Yakshagana prosody. She translated the first script during the lockdown.

The first video production has Kolthige Narayana Gowda, Jabbar Samo Sampaje and Jayananda Sampaje as “arthadaris”. Ms. Kulkunda, Murari Kadambalithaya and Akshay Rao Vitla are the background artistes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/7hdz84/article32888592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19MNYAKSHAGANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/video-of-arebhashe-talamaddale-to-go-online-soon/article32888593.ece

345,2020/10/19,China GDP growth accelerates to 4.9%,"Industrial output undergirds recovery.

China’s economic growth continued to gain momentum in the third quarter, with the GDP expanding 4.9% from a year earlier in the July-September period, according to official Chinese data released on Monday.

The pace of expansion was faster than the preceding quarter’s 3.2% and underlined the rebound in the world’s second-largest economy at a time when other major economies are struggling to recover from contractions triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns to combat it. Growth was, however, slower than the 5.2% pace forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.

The IMF has forecast China’s economy will expand by 1.9% in 2020, making it the only major economy to register growth in a pandemic-hit year.

The economic rebound follows China’s broad return to normalcy this summer, following sweeping COVID-19 curbs including stringent lockdowns, extensive contact tracing, and restrictions on international travel through the first half of the year, which allowed the authorities to almost entirely stop transmission of the virus within China, with the exception of a few clusters that were contained locally.

Travel rebounds

The country’s week-long October national holiday saw 630 million domestic trips and a surge in local tourism that generated $70 billion in revenue, with travel reported at 80% of last year’s numbers, according to Chinese financial magazine Caixin.

The recovery was driven by a 5.8% growth in industrial production and a revival of exports. A surge in investments in infrastructure projects, enabled by measures to boost liquidity, had been sanctioned by the government, which had to grapple with millions of job losses at the start of the year as a result of the pandemic’s first outbreak in Wuhan in December.

Consumption lags

Consumption, however, is yet to regain its normal vigour with retail sales in the January-September period still down 7.2% from a year earlier, even though growth rebounded in September to 3.3%, from August’s 0.5% pace.

“Whether you look at the most recent month, the quarter, or the year-to-date, it is obvious that the recovery in production vastly exceeds the recovery in consumption,” Michael Pettis, Finance Professor at Peking University in Beijing, said on Twitter, adding this would inflate an already ballooning debt burden.

“While private-sector business investment, which is driven mostly by growth in consumption and exports, was down 1.5% year-to-date, total fixed asset investment was up 0.8% for the year,” Mr. Pettis said. “As a result, China’s debt-to-GDP ratio rose dramatically, from roughly 252 last September to roughly 275 last month,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/s2q3c8/article32895757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THBUCHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/china-gdp-growth-accelerates-to-49/article32895758.ece
346,2020/10/19,"Assessing hit on economy, will share GDP estimate in time: FM","‘Policy soon to identify sectors where PSEs are needed’

The government has just begun its own assessment of India’s growth prospects for this year that would be shared in due course of time, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday evening.

The Minister also said that the government’s new policy for public sector enterprises, which will notify strategic sectors where at least one public unit needs to operate, is being finalised and will be put up for the Union Cabinet’s approval soon.

“We have only now started doing some kind of an assessment,” the Minister said. “We waited for the commencement of the second half of the year, which has just started. We have got a lot of inputs that are fairly different from what we had got in July, as ideally it should be,” she said, adding that a statement would be made in public or in Parliament once the exercise is complete.

She was responding to a query on whether India will come up with its own official estimates as part of a mid-year review, following estimates from the RBI and the International Monetary Fund that expect the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to contract by 9.5% and 10.4% in 2020-21, respectively.

347,2020/10/19,"Public Sector Enterprises clear dues worth ₹13,400 cr. to MSMEs","Corporates asked to follow suit.

The government on Monday said Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE) have cleared payments to the tune of ₹13,400 crore owed to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) in the last five months and ₹3,700 crore was paid to the units in September alone.

The MSME Ministry has now written to top management of over 2,800 corporates by name to make payment of pending dues of MSMEs in this month itself, an official statement said.

Last month, the ministry had written to the top 500 corporates of India about the pending dues.

In its latest communication to large corporates, the MSME Ministry underscored the importance of making such payments now and said that it will facilitate the small enterprises to avail business opportunities in the coming festival season.

The ministry said that if the cash flows of MSMEs improve, they can make use of the festival season when there is opportunity to earn by supplying goods and services.

“In fact, some of the MSMEs look for such a period for their sustenance of the whole year. Thus, timely payment of their receivables at this time will not only support the MSMEs and their dependents in this festive season but will also sustain many of them for a full year,” the statement said.

Therefore, the ministry has requested the corporates to see and make payment as soon as possible, preferably in the present month.

In addition, the ministry has also drawn attention of Corporate India towards important administrative, legal and Fintech-based provisions with regard to MSME payments.

The provisions state that it is ideal that payments are made in stipulated time. However, to solve the cash flow problems of MSMEs in absence of that, a bill discounting mechanism has been started by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the name of TReDS.

It is mandatory for all CPSEs and the companies with turnover of more than ₹500 crore to join this platform. However, many companies are yet to join or transact on it. Corporates have been requested to check whether their group/ company has joined the TReDS platform and is doing transactions.

The ministry also reminded the corporates of the legal provision under the MSME Development Act, 2006 which mandates to make the payment to MSMEs within 45 days.

“As per related regulations, the corporate entities are also supposed to file half-yearly returns with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs about the dues of MSMEs. In many cases, this too is not being done. The Ministry has requested the corporates for their attention and needful action on this also,” the statement said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/5s2cqv/article29269567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UNION-MINISTER-NITIN-GADKARI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/public-sector-enterprises-clear-dues-to-msmes/article32891793.ece
348,2020/10/19,Hatsun gets nod for 1:3 bonus shares,"The board also approved a proposal for raising funds through private placement of equity shares by way of Qualified Institutional Placement, it said in a regulatory filing.

Dairy products maker Hatsun Agro Product Ltd. has approved the issue of bonus shares in the ratio of one new equity share for every three shares held by shareholders. The record date is December 3, 2020, subject to necessary approvals.

The board also approved a proposal for raising funds through private placement of equity shares by way of Qualified Institutional Placement, it said in a regulatory filing.

On Monday, the Hatsun Agro board announced top level changes, with the current managing director R.G. Chandramogan appointed as chairman (non-executive director), following the relinquishment of the post by K.S. Thanarajan, who was redesignated as non-executive, non-independent director. Executive director C. Sathyan was elevated as managing director.

The company announced its results for the quarter ended September, reporting a 161% rise in standalone net profit to ₹66 crore. Total income rose to ₹1,329 crore from ₹1,280 crore.

For the current fiscal, Hatsun has decided to invest ₹245 crore in setting up an ice cream plant in Telangana. Construction activities are on and the plant is expected to be on stream during the fourth quarter of FY21.

The company said it aimed to complete the installation of a milk products manufacturing facility in Dharapuram, Tamil Nadu, in December and a milk processing unit with a capacity of 1.5 LLPD by March.

Full-fledged commercial production of milk and milk products at its plant in Solapur, with a capacity of 4 LLPD, is expected to be ready by November, it said.

349,2020/10/19,"Sugar production to rise 13%, even as industry grapples with surplus opening balance stock","Sugar production is likely to rise 13% to 310 lakh tonnes this year, even as 106 lakh tonnes are still available from the previous year, according to the industry estimates.

A significant increase in exports and ethanol diversion is needed to stave off a renewed liquidity crisis, which could jeopardise payment of dues to cane farmers.

The sugar season runs from October to September. In its first advance estimates for the 2020-21 season released on Monday, the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) said it expected 330 lakh tonnes of sugar production based on total cane expected to be crushed by mills this season. However, it also expects that the diversion of cane juice and B-molasses to ethanol production will result in the loss of 20 lakh tonnes of sugar, ending up with 310 lakh tonnes.

This is 13% higher than last year’s production of 274 lakh tonnes, driven largely by a 48% increase in Maharashtra’s net cane plantation area. Among other major sugarcane-growing States, Karnataka and Gujarat have also seen some increase in crop area, although Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu saw marginal decreases. Monsoon rainfall has been good in most States, and reservoirs are full, leading to high production expectations.

However, the remaining sugar stock from the previous year is at 106 lakh tonnes, which is 55 lakh tonnes more than the domestic requirement for the next few months before the new season’s sugar production becomes fully available in the market. “Since we expect much higher production in 2020-21 SS, India will need to continue to export about 60 lakh tonnes of the surplus sugar out of the country during 2020-21 SS,” said ISMA.

High production and surplus stocks tend to drive down prices, resulting in mill owners delaying payment of dues to cane farmers. In Uttar Pradesh alone, arrears to farmers had crossed ₹8,000 crore even before the beginning of the new season. Over the last few years, the Centre has taken steps to incentivise exports and ethanol diversion in a bid to reduce stocks and improve liquidity.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/pst1zv/article32895598.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CaptureJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sugar-production-to-rise-13-even-as-industry-grapples-with-surplus-opening-balance-stock/article32895539.ece

351,2020/10/19,"Air India bid deadline may be extended till December 15, govt to ease asset valuation norm","The source said bids will be sought on an enterprise value basis - a popular valuation methodology for takeover deals.

To attract potential suitors, the government will ease asset valuation norms for Air India by allowing bidders to put in offers on an enterprise value basis, a source said on Monday.

Also read: Govt. may reduce Air India’s debt and delay disinvestment to woo buyers

To begin with, the government is likely to further extend the deadline for putting in a preliminary expression of interest for the loss-making national carrier to December 15.

The source said bids will be sought on an enterprise value basis - a popular valuation methodology for takeover deals.

Enterprise value (EV) is a measure of a company’s total value, often used as a more comprehensive alternative to equity market capitalization. EV includes in its calculation the market capitalization of a company but also short-term and long-term debt as well as any cash on the company’s balance sheet.

The source said the government would remove from the Preliminary Information Memorandum (PIM) the quantum of debt to be assumed by the bidder.

The bidders would also be asked to place offers for the entire company, 85% of which would be considered to go towards debt repayment and the balance would accrue to the government, the source said.

“Changes are being made to the valuation method. CGD (Core Group on Disinvestment) has approved it and it would be placed before AISAM (Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism). The deadline for Air India bid is proposed to be extended till December 15, the source told PTI.

This would be the fifth extension to the Air India bid deadline with the current one ending on October 30.

After its unsuccessful bid to sell Air India in 2018, the government in January 2020 restarted the divestment process and invited bids for selling 100% of its equity in the State-owned airline, including Air India’s 100% shareholding in AI Express Ltd and 50% in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd.

In 2018, the government had offered to sell its 76% stake in the airline.

Of the airline’s total debt of ₹60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019, the buyer would be required to absorb ₹23,286.5 crore, while the rest would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), a special purpose vehicle.

The source further said that the government would be giving a “merit list” of Air India debts to the interested bidders at the due diligence stage based on which the bidders can decide on which debt to repay.

The change in valuation methodology for Air India was necessary as the aircraft fleet is idle during COVID time and valuation based on flight operating capacity would not be possible at present.

The government would be giving time to potential bidders to raise queries on the change in valuation methodology, the source added.

For the current fiscal, the budget has pegged disinvestment proceeds at ₹2.10 lakh crore. This includes ₹1.20 lakh crore from CPSE share sale and ₹90,000 crore from share sale in public sector banks and financial institutions, including listing of insurance behemoth LIC.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r0o94b/article32359058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIRINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/air-india-bid-deadline-may-be-extended-till-dec-15-govt-to-ease-asset-valuation-norm/article32892462.ece
352,2020/10/19,"IOC to offer differentiated fuels, hydrogen-spiked CNG","The company has already set up EV-charging points at 76 petrol pumps and battery-swapping facilities at 11 outlets.

India’s top oil firm IOC is remodelling business with an increased focus on petrochemicals to hedge volatility in the fuel business, while at the same time turning petrol pumps into energy outlets that offer EV charging points and battery swapping options besides conventional fuels as it looks to make itself future-ready.

In an interview with PTI, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) Chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said the intention is to become the energy company of the country and not just be restricted to selling petroleum products.

IOC, which controls over 40% of India’s diesel-dominated petroleum product market, recently introduced differentiated LPG for industrial users that gives flame temperature that is 80% higher than conventional cooking gas, thereby cutting down cooking time and saving 5-8% on fuel.

Also, the company has introduced hydrogen-spiked CNG that will give BS-VI (equivalent to Euro-VI) emissions from BS-IV vehicles, he said.

“Eventually we intend to become the energy company of India and not just be restricted to selling petroleum products,” he said. “The world is changing. We intend to set up EV charging points and battery swapping stations at our petrol pumps alongside offering auto-LPG and conventional fuels. So it will be a bouquet of offering.”

IOC has already set up EV-charging points at 76 petrol pumps and battery-swapping facilities at 11 outlets. It is also evaluating different advanced battery technologies and intends to set up a metal-air battery-manufacturing facility for EVs as well as for stationary applications.

Mr. Vaidya said being the biggest retailer, IOC faces the threat of losing market share to any new entrant.

“We understand that and so we are now focusing on the way we do retail,” he said.

All the 29,800 petrol pumps of the company have been fully automated and their look and feel enhanced to match private-sector competition.

“Now, we are damn sure of giving Q&Q, that is quality and quantity,” he said. “With automation done, we can guarantee that. And we now have the look and feel to match anybody,” he said.

Public sector firms dominate India’s fuel market but new entrants such as Nayara Energy have been chipping at their market share. Also, Reliance Industries has renewed its interest in fuel retailing through a joint venture with UK supermajor BP Plc. Adani Group too is eyeing the segment through a tie-up with TOTAL of France.

Mr. Vaidya said IOC has strong research and development (R&D) that is bringing to market differentiated fuels. The company has got encouraging response for its recently launched differentiated LPG and will now go for expanding its reach, he said.

“We have launched a differentiated LPG with the brand name Indane ‘Xtra Tej’ last month for non-domestic customers. It will yield approx 5-8% savings in fuel consumption over normal LPG,” he said.

Also, the company has introduced CNG spiked with 18% hydrogen that eliminates the need for replacing the old BS-IV fleet of vehicles as it gives emissions compliant with superior BS-VI grade, he said adding H-CNG is being dispensed from one outlet in the national capital and would soon be extended to others.

IOC has also established itself as the second-largest player in natural gas in India with a licence to retail CNG and piped cooking gas in 40 Geographical Areas. “We are also aggressively promoting the use of compressed biogas, 2-G ethanol, and biodiesel produced from used cooking oil, besides integrating our refinery processes with biofuels production,” he said.

But the fuel business is prone to volatilities that squeeze margins. To de-risk the business, IOC plans to add petrochemical plants at all of its nine oil refineries, he said.

“This would de-risk the fuel business. We realise that the volatility of the market can be easily controlled by having a good footprint in the petrochemical sector,” he said. “Petroleum fuels continue to be my main business as far as turnover is concerned, but profitability I intend to get from petrochemicals.”

The petrochemical intensity - the percentage of crude oil converted into chemicals- is low at 5-6% currently. “We intend to take it up to 10-12%,” he said.

The firm’s newer refineries at Panipat in Haryana and Paradip in Odisha have the petrochemical intensity of 15-20% which would be raised to 25%, he said adding all-India average being targeted is 10-12%.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/qlyj0w/article31513414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PETROLANDDIESEL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ioc-to-offer-differentiated-fuels-hydrogen-spiked-cng/article32892088.ece
353,2020/10/19,Bank of Baroda completes technology integration with erstwhile Vijaya Bank,"This is part of the post-merger integration of the first three-way merger of public sector banks in India

Accenture and Bank of Baroda have announced the successful completion of technology integration of the former Vijaya Bank’s branches with Bank of Baroda which has now enabled 21 million Vijaya Bank customers to have access to Bank of Baroda’s banking services.

This is part of the post-merger integration of the first three-way merger of public sector banks in India.

Accenture is now helping align former Dena Bank’s IT systems with Bank of Baroda.

The merger of Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with Bank of Baroda in 2019 created the country's third largest public sector bank.

Upon completion, the combined technology architecture will help the merged entity seamlessly integrate its India-wide customer service and business operations network of nearly 9,000 bank branches and more than 12,000 ATMs.

In its role as lead technology partner, Accenture developed the blueprint for consolidating the IT systems of the three banks and is overseeing the execution of the technology integration strategy, which includes data migration, application and data center consolidation, as well as business continuity management, Accenture said in a statement.

“With the completion of the Vijaya Bank migration, around 21 million customers from across 1,900 Vijaya Bank branches have been seamlessly migrated to Bank of Baroda. The migration was executed remotely during the ongoing pandemic with no impact on business continuity,” the statement added.

Sharad Saxena, Chief Technology Officer, Bank of Baroda said, “Our technology integration goal is to offer uninterrupted customer services while paving the way for the next-generation banking experience across the merged entity.”

“Accenture’s role in the consolidation of the technology infrastructure of former Vijaya Bank with that of Bank of Baroda has helped us offer a smooth, hassle-free experience to our customers during the migration. The integrated technology architecture gives former Vijaya Bank customers the ability to opt for Bank of Baroda’s entire suite of offerings, while continuing to use their existing payment instruments until further notice,” he added.

Stating that technically plays a pivotal role in successful post-merger integration and unlocking value for all stakeholders, Sonali Kulkarni, lead financial services, Accenture in India said “With this collaboration, our objective has been to minimize disruption to the employees and customers across the three banks, while enabling business continuity”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/8tsvip/article31204213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30BANK-OF-BARODA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/bank-of-baroda-completes-technology-integration-with-erstwhile-vijaya-bank/article32891948.ece

361,2020/10/19,Still awaiting police reform,"It is time for the judiciary to step in and enforce the diktats it had passed in 2006

Police brutality in recent months has turned quotidian. The thrashing of a Dalit Ahirwar couple by the police in Guna district of Madhya Pradesh on July 14 was very distressing. But for the media coverage, the incident would have gone unnoticed. The District Collector and the Superintendent of Police have been transferred and six police personnel have been suspended since the incident. The matter will soon be forgotten.

The public outcry following the brutal torture of J. Benicks and his father P. Jayaraj in Sattankulam town in Thoothkudi district of Tamil Nadu resulting in their death had still not died when news came that a gangster, Vikas Dubey, was killed by the Uttar Pradesh police in Kanpur when he allegedly tried to flee from custody. The police version of the incident was quite unbelievable. It looked like the law had been subverted.

Comment | Police reform and the crucial judicial actor

These incidents and several others show that we need immediate remedial measures lest the country witnesses an upheaval of the kind that the U.S. saw following the death of George Floyd. Should such a situation arise, it will be the political class that will squarely be held responsible, for it is they who have proved to be the stumbling block in the implementation of various apex court directives aimed at improving the functioning of the police.

Solutions that remain on paper

Commissions and committees are set up every time there are demands for police reforms after a major incident. Then the recommendations of such commissions and committees are simply consigned to the archives. But they are not forgotten as some senior police officials vociferously demand implementation of their recommendations from time to time.

The first serious attempt to overhaul the policing machinery was made when the National Police Commission (NPC) was set up in 1977. The NPC submitted eight reports to the Ministry of Home Affairs between 1979 and 1981. Seven of these reports were circulated to the States in 1983 with an annotation that “the Commission has been unduly critical of the political system or the functioning of the police force in general”. In a subtle manner, a signal had been sent. The report was put in cold storage until Prakash Singh, a retired IPS officer, filed a PIL in the apex court in 1996 demanding the implementation of the NPC’s recommendations.

Comment | The mystery of police reform

In 2006, the Supreme Court issued a slew of directives on police reform. These would have had a far-reaching impact had the States and the Centre paid any serious attention to them. But that would have upset the applecart of our politicians and even the bureaucrats, some of whom are known to be corrupt and mired in crime. According to a report by the Association for Democratic Reforms (2018), there were 1,580 MPs and MLAs facing criminal charges. Therein lies the crux of the matter.

Turning a blind eye

The one diktat that would hurt the most is the setting up of a State Security Commission (SSC) in each State which would divest the political leaders of the unbridled power that they wield at present. Of the States that constituted an SSC, only Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have made SSC recommendations binding on the State government, according to the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative. Only six States provided a minimum tenure of two years to the Director General of Police (DGP). In Tamil Nadu, T.K. Rajendran, who was made DGP (Intelligence) and given full additional charge as DGP in September 2016, was formally appointed DGP on the day he attained the age of superannuation. Many States have not implemented a single directive of the Supreme Court.

Comment | Awaiting police reforms

Since expecting political will to implement police reforms is a far cry, it is for the judiciary to step in and enforce the diktats it had passed. Fourteen years is too long a period for any further relaxation. The Court has to come down heavily on the States and the Centre to ensure that its directives are not dismissed lightly. A bold step towards bringing down crimes is possible only when the politicians-criminals-police nexus is strangled.

362,2020/10/19,Probing judicial impropriety and corruption,"Only retired judges of high credibility would be able to conduct a robust inquiry into Jagan Reddy’s complaint.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy dropped a bomb last week when he wrote to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) accusing a sitting judge of the Supreme Court of judicial impropriety and corruption and State High Court judges of bias.

Contents of the letter

The letter refers to the purchase of agricultural land, in the area to be declared as the capital city of Andhra Pradesh, between the time when Chandrababu Naidu became Chief Minister in 2014 and the time when he announced the demarcation of the new capital at Amaravati. The charge is that the land was purchased by persons, including the Supreme Court judge’s daughters and in-laws (named subsequently in an FIR), after declaration of the capital area limits, at the same low price for the lands which existed before the demarcation, when in fact the market prices had skyrocketed, thereby causing huge pecuniary gain to them. In this connection, in March, the Principal Secretary (Home), Andhra Pradesh Government, wrote to the Secretary of the Union Ministry of Public Grievances and Pensions seeking a CBI inquiry into the findings of a Cabinet sub-committee, set up to investigate charges of corrupt dealings in land purchases. The sub-committee had “opined that public servants at the helm of affairs in the erstwhile government misused and abused their official position to pre-determine the location of the new capital and subsequently purchased lands to unjustly and illegally benefit their associates and their companies and businesses, family members and political party members…”

The Hindu Explains | What can CJI Bobde do about charges levelled against judges by the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister?

Mr. Reddy accused the Supreme Court judge of influencing the allocation of benches at the State High Court (his parent High Court) to hear politically sensitive cases. This, he wrote, led to the passing of a string of orders staying a number of investigations of corruption against the Naidu government. One of the cases the letter cites to show that the High Court is favouring Mr. Naidu is an extraordinary order passed late one evening by the Chief Justice of the High Court staying all investigations into the FIR involving this land scam, which mentions the relatives of the Supreme Court judge as well as a former Advocate General as beneficiaries. The Chief Justice also issued an unprecedented gag order on the media from reporting the contents of the FIR.

The letter also mentions the High Court’s recent order of an inquiry into a private conversation between a retired judge of the High Court and a district judge (under suspension). In the conversation, the retired judge is heard mentioning his knowledge about the corruption of this Supreme Court judge and asking the district judge if he has more information in this regard. The district judge then surprisingly files an application in a pending writ (seeking an investigation into the death of a backward class registrar of the High Court due to alleged violations of COVID-19 guidelines at the High Court) bringing on record this telephone conversation which he had secretly recorded. This unrelated conversation, filed in an intervention which was not even allowed, and which has nothing to do with the prayers in the main writ, is then made the basis for ordering an inquiry into what the High Court terms “designing a plot against The Hon’ble Chief Justice of High Court of Andhra Pradesh and another sitting Judge of the Supreme Court”. This is a rather extraordinary order, especially considering that much of the conversation contained information on the Supreme Court judge already in the public domain and does not make out any plot or conspiracy against a judge or the judiciary to warrant such an inquiry.

With these developments, two questions have arisen: one, whether such a letter/complaint against the Supreme Court judge should have been put out in the public domain; and two, what the CJI’s response should be. In 1997, judges adopted an in-house procedure for inquiring into such charges. In case of a complaint against a Supreme Court judge, the CJI is expected to order an inquiry by three sitting judges of the Supreme Court. Though in C. Ravichandran Iyer v. Justice A.M. Bhattacharjee (1995), the court held that such complaints should be kept confidential, the unfortunate reality is that the judiciary tends to try and brush complaints of corruption against judges under the carpet. Sometimes, if the public becomes aware of such complaints, the CJI is compelled to order an inquiry. But we have often seen that even credible complaints against judges, made confidentially to the CJI, are ignored.

Jagan vs. judges | Andhra Pradesh CM’s letter an affront to judiciary, says ex-Supreme Court judge

The same is seen in attempts to impeach a judge. I have found that at least two conditions must be satisfied before a sufficient number of MPs are willing to sign an impeachment motion against a judge: there should be solid documentary evidence of corruption and it should have become a public scandal. In the absence of the second condition, MPs are reluctant to sign an impeachment motion even if there is documentary evidence of corruption. The Ravichandran Iyer decision, that the complaint should be kept confidential, is only likely to lead to more serious complaints being shelved. In any case, as the court has held, sunlight is the best disinfectant and there is no reason why such complaints, even if made against senior sitting judges, should not be put out in the public domain. The view that this would scandalise the court is archaic and has been discarded in most progressive democracies.

Editorial | Unpleasant spectacle

Now, petitions have been moved seeking action against Mr. Reddy for releasing the letter to the media. Contempt proceedings against him would be counterproductive, since he is unlikely to be cowed down. The issue will probably escalate, further denting the image of the judiciary. Some say Mr. Reddy’s charges against the judge should not be taken seriously since he is himself facing several corruption cases. In fact, a Bench headed by the same Supreme Court judge ordered fast-tracking of such criminal cases against MPs and MLAs. However, the fact that the complainant may be corrupt should not cloud the view about the charges made by him; if those charges are serious and backed by evidence, they must be investigated. Charges of corruption can also be a ground for initiating impeachment. Such charges therefore cannot remain secret.

Jagan vs. judges | It is premature to pass resolution, says Supreme Court Bar Association chief Dushyant Dave

What should the CJI do?

The purpose of the in-house procedure is that all credible complaints of misconduct against judges of the High Court and Supreme Court should be looked into by a committee of judges. The charges made in Mr. Reddy’s complaint are serious and appear to warrant an in-house inquiry. The code of conduct requires an inquiry by three sitting judges of the Supreme Court. But in a complaint involving the senior-most puisne judge, it is unlikely that junior judges will conduct a robust and credible inquiry. In the case of the sexual harassment complaint against the previous CJI, Ranjan Gogoi, by a woman employee of the Supreme Court, the in-house committee did not allow the complainant to be accompanied by her lawyer, nor did it allow recording of the proceedings. The final report, which purportedly exonerated Mr. Gogoi, has not yet seen the light of day. Strangely, the woman whose allegations were found to be unsubstantiated by this committee was later reinstated by the Court. This casts serious doubts on the credibility of the report.

Comment | A constitutional pickle of the Andhra kind

Only retired judges of high credibility will be able to conduct a robust inquiry into Mr. Reddy’s complaint. The Chief Justice should set up a credible inquiry committee. This will enhance the reputation of the judiciary, dispel mistruths, and redeem the image of the judge concerned.

India’s poor progress on nutritional indices must dispel the hubris surrounding strong economic growth for years, and turn national focus on persisting hunger, wasting and stunting among children. This year’s Global Hunger Index (GHI) places India in the company of Sudan — rank 94 among 107 countries — with the unedifying assessment of the national situation as “serious”. The country’s score of 27.2 is the worst among BRICS countries, and inferior to Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal. The GHI is developed around wasting and stunting (under five), the share of the population with insufficient caloric intake, and child mortality. Index scores by international agencies have been critiqued as flawed for choosing the wrong weights in scoring, and also for not including genetics and social determinants, but that would be a narrow view. The evidence from the NFHS-4 of 2015-16 is not very different. The reality is that national policy has no appetite for a radical transformation in the delivery of adequate nutrition especially to women and children, and has paid inadequate attention to achieving diet diversity through the PDS. On the other hand, the country is widely seen as falsely equating energy calories with a diverse diet. The existing deprivation has been aggravated by the pandemic, with food inflation putting pressure on depleted incomes or meagre pensions and savings.

The NFHS-4 found that under-five stunting from chronic undernourishment stood at 38%, and wasting, a result of acute lack of nutrition, at 21%. These data represent some progress, at a drop of about 10 percentage points in both categories compared to a decade earlier, although steady economic prosperity should have yielded a far bigger social dividend. The latest GHI measure is a reminder that much work is necessary to bring the true benefits of the National Food Security Act to the unreached, not merely as hunger mitigation through cereals, but as nourishment through a diverse diet that includes fat, protein and micronutrients. But there are worrying indications that the Centre has chosen the wrong course. In its pursuit of fraud within the PDS, it is inclined to take hard measures that would deprive the disabled and the elderly of even cereals, by insisting on biometric verification to get supplies. Strengthening the PDS, with a focus on women’s health, would lead to healthier pregnancies, and stronger supplemental nutrition under the ICDS scheme would give children a better chance at all-round development. The importance of sustained, immediate intervention is further underscored by recent findings of International Food Policy Research Institute scholars that three out of four rural Indians cannot afford a balanced, nutritious diet. The right to food would be meaningless if it leaves a large section of Indians hungry, stunted and wasted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-great-escape-the-hindu-editorial-on-indias-low-rank-on-nutritional-indices/article32887692.ece
364,2020/10/19,An incomplete solution: On Centre borrowing for States,"The Centre must assure States on the timeline for payment of the GST compensation due

The past week witnessed some forward, albeit inexplicably delayed, movement towards breaking the deadlock between the Centre and States on bridging this year’s shortfall in cess collections to recompense States for adopting the GST. Following a lack of consensus at a third meeting of the GST Council on the issue last Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said States that had agreed to the Centre’s proposal could begin borrowing from the market. To recap — the Centre had argued that just ₹1.1-lakh crore of the estimated ₹2.35-lakh crore shortfall in GST cess inflows was due to GST implementation; the rest was due to COVID-19. States could borrow ₹1.1-lakh crore with interest and principal payments to come from future cess collections; or borrow the ₹2.35-lakh crore, but bear the interest from their coffers. By Wednesday, 21 States had agreed to the Centre’s first option and were permitted to raise about ₹79,000 crore (0.5% of their gross State domestic product) as additional borrowing linked to their acceptance of the option. On Thursday, however, the Centre changed tack and said it was now willing to borrow the ₹1.1-lakh crore and lend it onward. Calling this an administratively easier measure to ensure States do not end up borrowing at different interest rates, the Ministry asserted this would neither increase the fiscal deficit nor the general government debt.

States and economists have welcomed this change of heart, especially as it helps bring in much needed cash for States to fight the pandemic. However, it is odd that the ‘administrative ease’ of the Centre borrowing and lending to States, had not struck North Block mandarins earlier — given that the cess collection worries surfaced soon after the lockdown was imposed. Over the course of the negotiations, States had urged the Centre to borrow and pay them, but the Finance Ministry had repeatedly stressed that this would push up interest rates and upset its fiscal math. Precious time could have been saved had the Centre made this offer earlier — seven months into a year that has seen economic activity and revenue sources dry up, and States have only received ₹20,000 crore from the GST cess. Kerala, which was considering a petition in the Supreme Court with other Opposition-ruled States, has cooled off on the legal route, but sought full payment of the ₹2.35-lakh crore shortfall this fiscal. On Friday, Ms. Sitharaman wrote to Chief Ministers suggesting that the ₹1.1-lakh crore, in addition to the 0.5% of GSDP borrowing, would give them ₹2.16-lakh crore, or almost 90% of the compensation shortfall. Cash flow assurances aside, the Centre must now talk to States to ensure greater clarity on the unanswered questions — including when the States will get the balance GST compensation. That is imperative to sustain the fragile peace attained for now.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-incomplete-solution-the-hindu-editorial-on-centre-borrowing-for-states-to-meet-gst-shortfall/article32887686.ece

The State government has suspended Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) former Chief Accounts Officer R. Govindaraj. Earlier this month, the BBMP had repatriated the official for alleged dereliction of duty and violation of rules in paying bills to contractors.

BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad told reporters here on Monday that the official had illegally diverted funds under the 14th Finance Commission and State Finance Commission earmarked for approved projects for ward level works. Around ₹400 crore funds under the 14th Finance Commission, ₹125 crore under State Finance Commission, and ₹13 crore earmarked for special infrastructure projects had allegedly been diverted. A wrong opinion given by the official had also resulted in financial loss to the civic body.

“Totally, funds amounting to nearly ₹680 crore have been found to be diverted. A detailed report was submitted to the State government, following which the government decided to suspend the official,” he said.

He said that during the investigation, it was found that ₹89 crore payments had been made offline. “This is serious, as there is no guarantee that double payments have not been made.”

However, he said the enquiry was still on and bank reconciliation was under way. He said the investigating team, headed by Special Commissioner, would submit an interim and final report.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmps-former-cao-suspended/article32895412.ece

He returned the next day to find the lock of the room open and many equipment missing. He enquired with the staff who claimed not to know anything.

Ironically, the building houses senior officials of the prison department and their staff and has security personnel in place. Despite this, thieves venturing into the building and carrying away the equipment is strange, a police officer said.

372,2020/10/19,Semi-wholesalers withdraw hunger strike in Koyambedu market,"Officials assured them that the dates for reopening shops would be announced within a few days.

A section of vegetables and fruits semi-wholesalers staged a hunger strike on Monday seeking shops to be reopened in the Koyambedu market in Chennai.

However, the indefinite hunger strike announced by the semi-wholesale traders was withdrawn by afternoon after officials of the Koyambedu Market Management Committee and police held talks with them.

Semi-wholesalers, who protested in the market, noted that owners of licensed wholesale shops at Koyambedu were provided alternate space in Thirumazhisai, Madhavaram and Vanagaram after the market was closed in May.

However, nearly 2,300 semi-wholesale shops remain closed for several months now and merchants who were functioning in 150 sq.ft and 300 sq.ft. shops were out of business since May. These traders deal with smaller quantities and sell even in a few kilograms to retailers.

S.S.Muthukumar, a vegetable semi-wholesaler, said “We had earlier given petitions to various government authorities on the issue. We were not provided alternate sites to operate or given any compensation. The government had announced that semi-wholesale shops too will be opened in phases. We had to protest to attract the government’s attention.”

By Monday afternoon, the semi-wholesalers withdrew the protest as officials had assured them that the dates for reopening shops would be announced within a few days.

373,2020/10/19,How families and communities are celebrating Navarathri against the backdrop of a pandemic,"Children sell thambulam packs for a cause

Navarathri is always a grand affair at RMT, MRC Nagar, with the entire community getting together every day for a community golu, themed games, Lalitha Sahasranamam chanting and bhajan sessions at the club house. This year, we have refused to let the pandemic defeat our community spirit and we have come up with themes that would still enable us to celebrate together while ensuring everyone’s safety.

The key events being conducted include daily Zoom sessions for Sahasranaman chanting, Navarathri-themed storytelling and quiz sessions for the children, bhajans performed by children, a fashion show and daily interactive learning sessions conducted by the resident-volunteers on simple skills like garland-weaving, rangoli-making, festive decorations and prasad making.

We have also planned a Dandia and Garbha flash mob on Saraswathi Pooja as the finale, this too from the safety of our homes via Zoom.

RMT’s cultural team has also provided basic guidelines on the safety precautions to be kept in mind keep in mind when visiting homes/inviting people for thambulam. These include avoiding congregation of large numbers at a home and limiting the number of guests to three or four at any time, keeping separate days for visitors from outside the community and ensuring basic precautions within homes like availability of sanitisers on arrival, wearing masks and maintaining distance.

One of the highlights this year is the initiative by the children who are making and selling thambulam packages to the residents and nearby communities, the proceeds from the sales of which will be used to bring cheer to the residents of an old age home that has been hit hard due to the pandemic.

Kolu with frontline workers

Navaratri celebrations at Sakambari Women’s Group is not complete without offering some assistance to the underprivileged. Last year, 25 women, mostly domestic workers, flower and vegetable vendors and cleaners participated in the celebration. This year, it will be a low-key event that we will be hosting on October 25 at our centre in RA Puram (we also have one at Indira Nagar), for women, including women conservancy workers who keep our roads clean.

The number of participants will be limited and the celebration will adhere to social distancing norms. With a mini kolu, the function will be marked by chanting of songs and music.

At the spacious premises of our centre on Third Main Road, R.A. Puram, around 50 persons can be accommodated, but this year we have invited less than 20 people. Ten to twelve chairs will be arranged leaving more than three feet between chairs. If a guest turns up without a mask, we will provide them with one.

We have decided not to serve any food; instead, take-away packs will be given away. The gift kit will contain provisions and ₹100 each — the cost of this kit is covered by contributions from members.

Raji Rao, president, Sakambari Women’s Group

Masks and sanitiser as return gifts

I am among the few families at our 50-flat apartment complex in Vadapalani that is displaying the kolu this year. I did not want to miss out on this tradition but at the same time I wanted to ensure sarve janah sukhino bhavanthu (a Vedic mantra that translates into “May all be happy and free from all illness”) so I have taken all safety precautions before inviting people home to witness my kolu alangarams.

Unlike in the previous years where guests were welcome all through the nine days, this time I invite only five families a day. Masks are compulsory for those entering the house.

To minimise any physical interaction whatsoever while distributing return gifts, I have placed them in a table near the entrance of my house. The traditional thambulam is packed with a hand sanitiser and masks as part of the return gift.

This is the first time I am celebrating Navaratri without distributing prasadams, but I am thankful that I am able to celebrate it in these testing times.

Rani Sairam, Vadapalani

Distribution at temple

We usually keep nine steps for the golu, but due to the pandemic I plan to reduce the number of steps and also limit the number of visitors invited to view our arrangement at home. Alternatively, I plan to visit the nearby Ponniamman temple, two days, and give thambulam to women. This way, I would also be limiting the number of guests coming home.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/c82e62/article32889970.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18dcadyrRMT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/how-families-and-communities-are-celebrating-navarathri-against-the-backdrop-of-a-pandemic/article32889971.ece
374,2020/10/19,Chennai wakes up to overcast skies,"North Tamil Nadu will continue to experience rainfall till Tuesday, says IMD

Residents of the city woke up to an overcast sky and rain on Sunday. The same weather pattern may continue till Tuesday over north Tamil Nadu, according to the Meteorological Department.

Rainfall in several areas brought down the day temperature by several notches in the city. On Sunday, the weather stations in Nungambakkam and Meenamabakkam recorded a maximum temperature of 26.6 degree Celsius and 26.5 degree Celsius, which is nearly 6 degree Celsius lower than the average for the day. Some localities in the city will experience thunderstorms till Tuesday.

The maximum temperature will be around 30 degree Celsius.

S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology, Chennai, said a low pressure area was expected to form over the east-central Bay of Bengal on Monday and aid in rainfall over parts of the State, particularly the coastal region, till Tuesday. Some interior areas will also have chances of thunderstorms. Weather systems brewing in the Bay of Bengal would keep the southwest monsoon active over Tamil Nadu.

During the past 24 hours, ending 8.30 a.m. on Sunday, many places recorded moderate to heavy rainfall. Perungalur in Pudukottai district and Vallam in Thanjavur district registered the highest amount of rainfall for the day at 13 cm.

Officials of the Meteorological Department said convective activity and upper air circulation over the west-central Bay of Bengal off the south Andhra Pradesh coast had triggered rainfall over the region.

Scattered downpour

The Meteorological Department said one or two places in 15 districts, including Karur, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Cuddalore, Ranipet and Theni, would receive heavy to very heavy rain on Monday. Downpours would be fairly widespread and of light to moderate intensity in other districts, it added.

A similar issue was faced by a person who runs a child welfare home at Kilpauk. He rued that he was having to wait for more than two months after applying on the GCC portal. In the absence of the sanitary, fire safety and building certificates, the child welfare home faced the risk of being shut by the Social Defence Directorate.

A senior official of the GCC, however, said more than nine services, including renewal of sanitary certificates, trade licences and building plan approvals, had been computerised.

The aim of the system, launched in February, was to bring about more transparency and avoid human interface, he said.

The official said the delay could be because of health officials being involved in COVID-19 prevention work, and the problems would be sorted out in a month.

Those operating hostels, child-care centres and government-aided private schools urged the government to issue all mandatory certificates with validity for three years rather than one year.

381,2020/10/19,Coronavirus | Micro management plan proves a game changer in Chennai’s fight against COVID-19,"It has helped in door-to-door surveillance, conduct of fever clinics, supervision through home quarantine, monitoring system application and intensification of testing

The micro management plan, rolled out by the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) in June, to combat COVID-19 has proved to be a game changer. The civic agency has since been able to effectively coordinate and supervise the prevention work in the 200 wards.

According to GCC Commissioner G. Prakash, the plan has helped in door-to-door surveillance, conduct of fever clinics, supervision through the home quarantine and monitoring system (HQIMS) application, intensification of testing and creation of computerised reports for effective pandemic management. The spatial and temporal analysis of the fever camps has been obtained on a daily basis in over 39,000 streets.

Haphazard response

Before the strategy was formulated, there was little coordination between civic and health officials.

GCC zonal officers said sanitary officers/inspectors took much of the prevention work, including shifting of COVID-19 patients, contact-tracing, supervision of survey workers (sector health) and barricading of streets. The Assistant Executive Engineers (AEEs) and the Assistant Engineers (AEs) were not much involved in the containment work.

A senior GCC official of the Kodambakkam zone said that once the pandemic control work was unified and division-level response teams were formed, the containment operation became more professional, with daily gate meetings organised with sector health workers and plans for strategies finalised.

The feedback on unfinished tasks from the previous evening was also obtained.

The response teams, headed by the respective AEs/JEs, consisted of the divisional health officer, the medical officer of the Urban Primary Health Centre, the sanitary inspector, the tax collector, the licence inspector and the conservancy inspector.

They switched from a top-down management approach — senior officials giving orders and local officials taking steps — to the one that gives more freedom to local officials to manage workers and update containment works on a dedicated WhatsApp group.

Aggressive testing

The testing rate also gathered pace from June through the thousands of fever camps conducted in residential areas. As on Sunday, the GCC conducted nearly 61,000 fever camps that covered 30 lakh persons, with more than 1.75 lakh swabs taken, a senior official said.

Mr. Prakash said more than 20% of the population of the city had been covered through the fever camps.

While Chennai is still reporting more than 1,000 cases daily, civic officials, citing the peak of over 13,500 cases in the first week of September, say they have been able to prevent cluster formations.

A GCC official of the Adyar zone said the coordinated work system helped in strict surveillance of vegetable markets, which had been one of the biggest pandemic spreaders, with the testing of those working there every fortnight.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/8xb4qt/article32824941.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Oct10UpdateTHG067RJVS43jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/micro-management-plan-proves-a-game-changer-in-chennais-fight-against-covid-19/article32888666.ece

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder Thol. Thirumavalavan on Sunday urged the Tamil Nadu Government to stick to its stance that it would not allow Anna University to be recognised as ‘Institute of Eminence’ status if it meant loss of reservation and denying admission to poor students. In a social media post, Mr. Thirumavalavan said, “We welcome Higher Education Minister K.P. Anbalagan’s comments that Anna University doesn’t need a higher status and it wouldn’t just watch the Vice Chancellor’s actions.”

Mr. Thirumavalavan said that the State government should continue to reiterate its position till the end. Mr. Thirumavalavan also said that NEET has created a situation where only those with money can dream of medical education.

Clearing NEET

“I congratulate government school student Jeevithkumar for standing first among all government schools in India in NEET this year. However, his success also shows that one has to wait for one more year and spend lakhs [for NEET coaching] to succeed. Last year, he had only scored 193 out of 720 and had taken NEET coaching for a year by spending lakhs. It is only after that he has been able to score 664,” he said.

He added, “Jeevithkumar’s success proves that only those who can spend money can get a medical seat. Though the Tamil Nadu government has opposed NEET, it has not taken any effort to get the assent for the laws passed regarding the exam in the Assembly. The Chief Minister should explain to the people the government stance on NEET.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/thirumavalavan-urges-govt-to-stand-firm-on-anna-varsity-issue/article32888534.ece
383,2020/10/19,The hues in the green tribunal’s resilient journey,"Over 10 years, the NGT has made a difference to environmental protection, helped by a new tribe of legal practitioners.

Yesterday (October 18) was a significant day, as it marked the 10th anniversary of the National Green Tribunal, or NGT. Few ministries can boast of as varied, diverse, and challenging a mandate as the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The downside to this vast and all-encompassing scope, which covers forests, wildlife, environment, climate change and coastal protection, is that it gives rise to an equally diverse volume of litigation.

Complexities from day one

This was one of the very first things I realised upon assuming office as the Minister for Environment and Forests in the year 2009. The sheer number and complexity of cases, with several more being added every week, led the Supreme Court of India to designate a special Bench to handle these matters. This Bench, which met every Friday to deliberate on these and many other matters, came to be known fittingly as the ‘Forest Bench’. And this was to say nothing of the numerous matters that were filed and pending hearings in the various High Courts.

Given the time constraints of the top court and the High Courts, some cases had been pending for decades and in turn, spawning other linked matters which further delayed the process. I also realised that despite the efforts of the capable officers and experts assisting the Supreme Court, this was at best an ad hoc solution.

Stages in an evolution

Several years prior to my tenure, Parliament had passed laws related to the establishment of a National Environment Tribunal (1995) and a National Environment Appellate Authority (1997). The Authority was intended to act primarily as a forum for challenges to environmental clearances while the Tribunal could award limited amounts of compensation in cases of environmental damage to life or property. In my opinion, these did not go far enough in terms of jurisdiction, authority, impact, or autonomy.

It was clear that the enforcement, protection, and adjudication of environmental laws required a specialised and dedicated body. A tribunal, staffed with judges and environmental experts, would need to be empowered to hear these issues so that the burden on the High Courts and the Supreme Court could be reduced. The quality of time spent on these issues could also be increased as, unlike the Supreme Court, the tribunal could have benches in various States, thereby increasing access to all citizens. Thus, the idea for the ‘NGT’ was born.

This was not the first time that the idea had been mooted. In judgments such as M.C. Mehta & Anr. Etc vs Union Of India & Ors. Etc (1986), the then Chief Justice of India, Justice P.N. Bhagwati, had suggested “to the Government of India that since cases involving issues of environmental pollution, ecological destructions and conflicts over national resources are increasingly coming up for adjudication and these cases involve assessment and evolution of scientific and technical data, it might be desirable to set up Environmental Courts on the regional basis with one professional Judge and two experts drawn from the Ecological Sciences Research Group keeping in view the nature of the case and the expertise required for its adjudication. There would of course be a right of appeal to this Court from the decision of the Environment Court”.

These observations were recalled in 1999 by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of A.P. Pollution Control Board vs Prof. M.V. Nayudu (Retd.) which added its own emphasis on the need for a court that was “a combination of a Judge and Technical Experts” with an appeal to the Supreme Court from the Environmental Court.

The NGT’s first year was a turbulent one. Unlike the opaque legislative process followed today, the first draft of the NGT Bill was circulated as part of a pre-legislative consultation process and inspired widespread debate. Concerns ranged from the genuine to the absurd. In the first category, one of my senior colleagues argued that it would contribute to the trend of ‘tribunalisation’ (a debate that would achieve some closure a year later with the Supreme Court’s judgment in R. Gandhi’s case in 2010). In the last category, an environmental non-governmental organisation took issue with the name and argued that the word ‘Green’ could act as a green signal to potential polluters. Following its passage, the Madras High Court even issued notice on a petition which had challenged the Act as unconstitutional and stayed appointments to the body (an order vacated by the Supreme Court on appeal).

Incidentally, I had intended for the parent bench of the NGT to be in Bhopal, as a tribute and homage to the memory of the victims of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy of 1984. However, many of the jurists and retired judges I consulted suggested that for administrative considerations, it would be better for the Chair to be at Delhi.

The track record

Since its inception, the NGT has, apart from creating a new breed of legal practitioners, protected vast acres of forest land, halted polluting construction activities in metros and smaller towns. It has penalised errant officials who have turned a blind eye towards enforcing the laws, and held large corporate entities to account. It has protected the rights of tribal communities and ensured the enforcement of the “polluter pays” principle in letter and spirit. In this endeavour it has been assisted by brilliant practitioners, many of whom are young counsels, passionate and dedicated towards protecting the environment.

A change in attitude

Perhaps the biggest testament to the NGT’s success has been the attitude of the ruling government towards it. Three years ago, in a fashion similar to what has been done with the Right to Information Act, the Central Government attempted to dilute the criteria for appointments to the NGT and other tribunals. I challenged this dilution before the Supreme Court and my counsel, the renowned senior advocate, Mohan Parasaran, was called upon to assist the Bench as an amicus curiae in the case.

The rules (though not the Rule making power) were ultimately suspended by the Supreme Court. But key challenges remain: the NGT must focus less on governance issues and more on adjudication. Benches have to expand manifold. Vacancies have to be filled quickly.

In its next decade, the NGT must continue to remain a proactive ‘inconvenience’ to all those who, while pontificating grandiloquently on the need for environmental protection, take actions that make economic growth ecologically unsustainable.

384,2020/10/19,The Raj Bhavan’s new role — taking centre stage,"The political design behind increasing gubernatorial over-reach is simple — to crowd in on certain State governments

When in 2007 at the height of the agitation in Nandigram in West Bengal, Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi had allowed himself to express his “cold horror” at the ugly violence, Raisina Hill overseers were not pleased and their displeasure was conveyed to the Raj Bhavan in no uncertain terms. There was a definite clarity in New Delhi that a Governor need not get involved in the fracas among the political parties and leaders. That was “old India” and there was a commitment to the federal principle.

In the “new India”, a new role is being scripted for the Raj Bhavan, as is for all other constitutional institutions. The Governors in the non-Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled States have been given a licence to convert Raj Bhavans into a rival centre of political activism — even intrigue — against the elected governments.

The letter in Maharashtra

Hon’ble Jagdeep Dhankhar at the Kolkata Raj Bhavan, so far, had the distinction of being the most active licentiate — till his counterpart in the Mumbai Raj Bhavan decided last week to cross all limits of gubernatorial propriety. Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s by-now famous letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, demanding re-opening of the places of worship to the devotees across Maharashtra, is a brilliant but thoroughly unnerving innovation in a Governor’s bag of tricks of over-reach.

Various Raj Bhavans, of course, have become embroiled in extremely unsavoury controversies over the decade, partly because the Constitution of India does allow a certain discretion to the Governor. And a discretion invariably does get abused. The framers of the Constitution had definitely disfavoured the idea of an elected Governor because they were unambiguously clear that political power would only be vested with the Council of Ministers, headed by a Chief Minister; yet, they were not inclined to put in a formal Instrument of Instructions for the Governors and were content to believe that political decencies and correctness would be observed both by the Governor and the Chief Minister.

As the distinguished constitutional expert, Nani A. Palkhivala, saw it, “the Constitution intended that the Governor should be the instrument to maintain the fundamental equilibrium of the people of the State and to ensure that the mandates of the Constitution are respected in the State”. The assumption, of course, was that those appointed to a Raj Bhavan would be endowed with “a buddhi [wisdom] which sets apart a statesman from a politician”.

A twist to discretion

In the post-Nehruvian era, as our politics became rough and our politicians rougher, that buddhi eluded most Governors. As an appointee of the Union Government, the Governors have, predictably enough, been all too prone to do the bidding of the ruling party at the Centre.

Inevitably the “discretion” — be it choosing a Chief Minister, or requiring a Chief Minister to prove his/her majority, or dismissing a Chief Minister, dissolving the legislature, recommending President’s Rule — came to be tainted with partisan political considerations. More often than not, the gubernatorial discretion was abused, sometimes absurdly, even whimsically.

Editorial | On the loose: On West Bengal Governor Jaideep Dhankar

The Supreme Court did try, through its judgment in the S.R. Bommai case, to restore some kind of order on the rampant proclivities of Raj Bhavans. That, of course, did not prevent a Governor from becoming difficult. For example, a Governor has been known for, once, withholding his assent to the Budget because the Chief Minister was not inclined to accede to the Raj Bhavan’s demand for a fourth imported luxury car for “ His Excellency”.

But now, the BJP has accelerated the process of institutional lumpenisation. A new role for the Governors in the non-BJP ruled States has been devised. Without seeming to abuse his ‘discretion’, a Governor, like the gentleman in the Kolkata Raj Bhavan, can blatantly put the licence of ‘gubernatorial activism’ in the service of his bosses’ party interests. There is probably nothing in the Constitution that forbids a Governor from making a political nuisance of himself. The Twitter handle comes in handy. Or, no one can fault a Governor for granting an audience to delegations hostile to the Chief Minister. The Maharashtra Governor was all too willing to get himself photographed with a film actress, who was demonstratively brawling with Chief Minister Thackeray.

Also read | What is the Governor’s role if elections produce fractured verdicts?

Or, take the case of the West Bengal Governor openly suggesting that the police officials and the bureaucrats should perform their duties as “public servants are not political workers”. Almost, a hit-and-run strategy. And, then, leave it to the media to whip up a political cloud over such loaded utterances.

New low

Article 167 of the Constitution does allow a Governor to call for any information “relating to the administration of the affairs of the State”; but, with a wink from the bosses in the Union Home Ministry, a Governor like Mr. Dhankhar or Mr. Koshyari can become a total partisan. But, it was a new low when the Maharashtra Governor mockingly asked the Chief Minister if he had suddenly turned ‘secular’.

In the “old India”, the President of India would have mostly probably found a way of communicating the Rashtrapati Bhavan’s displeasure to the Maharashtra Governor for this ‘secular’ taunt. After all, secularism is very much a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, the very sacred book that a Governor takes oath to “preserve, protect and defend”.

Comment | Do we need the office of the Governor?

“Secularism” is not a dispensable part of the Constitution, nor is it a dirty word, as Governor Koshyari’s letter implied. After all, it has been pointed out by jurists and constitutional scholars that in the Kesavananda Bharati case, the Supreme Court had declared secularism as a basic feature of the Constitution, even before the Forty-Second Amendment had introduced the word ‘secular’ in the Preamble to the Constitution. The political design behind an over-active Raj Bhavan is simple: poke, prod, pinprick and provoke the elected government to waste its political energies and capital in an unwanted war of attrition; the BJP can be the only beneficiary from the resulting skirmishes.

Reflecting an arrogance

However, there is a certain method to this gubernatorial madness. Governors like Mr. Koshyari and Mr. Dhankhar are too insignificant as political players to have crafted on their own this new gubernatorial meddlesomeness; their overreach is only a reflection of a new arrogant mindset at work.

The Hindu explains | The powers of Governors and Lt. Governors

The Narendra Modi-Amit Shah leadership subscribes to a maximalist approach to the obligation of institutionalised sharing of power within our federal framework. Over and above the primacy of the Union, the BJP is allergic to the idea of having to share power and space with other political parties and players. The non-BJP governments, an unafraid Mamta Banerjee and unintimidated Uddhav Thackeray, are seen as eyesores which need to be removed. To that end, wherever possible, the Raj Bhavans would become the State BJP’s extension counters. No one should be surprised if the BJP were to use the contrived Koshyari-Thackeray dust-up in the Bihar election campaign later this month.

This itch for political intolerance is a recurring nightmare for the Indian Union. After she returned to power in 1980, Indira Gandhi was determined to use the Raj Bhavans to get rid of unhelpful non-Congress governments. Remember Governor Ram Lal in Andhra Pradesh or Governor Jagmohan in Jammu and Kashmir. But, now, a new righteous of the “new India” is being deployed to beautify an old-fashioned power lust. An over-bearing Centre appeals enormously to wannabe emperors.

Toy story

The quadruple whammy, in the form of cheap Chinese imports and the pandemic, demonetisation and introduction of GST, is squeezing the life out of domestic toy manufacturers (‘Ground Zero’ page, “Far from a happy toy story”, October 17). As an important first step, the Centre needs to impose a ban on Chinese toy imports. Additionally, a reduction in the Goods and Services Tax to the lowest slab needs to be implemented, by considering toys to be educational aids.

In terms of marketability, the G.I. tag of the toys can be leveraged and these toys presented to visiting Heads of State or Governments as a souvenir. These toys should also be handed out to the Padma, Arjuna, other sports and film awardees as a memento along with the respective awards. The government can also consider purchasing these toys in bulk and giving them to its schools for gifting to students below a certain age. “Play or Display” should be the slogan these toys should be marketed under.

Lastly, the Centre should also carry out an educational blitzkrieg, targeting the major importing countries, about wooden toys being safer.

Biometric ration supply

It is great that India, at almost all levels, is improving after the introduction of many changes. One such step is having electronic authentication for ration supply. However, there is a spoke in the wheel. With poor connectivity, the machine does not work and there are frequent scenes of people being made to wait long hours and then asked to return home to try their luck another day.

I have observed that not all provisions are supplied on the same day. It could be rice one day, dal another, and oil some other day. Each time, the individual concerned has to come in person and affix his thumb impression — that is if the machine is working. It is sad that it is an uncertain situation for the elderly, the disabled and the poor. Till now, in Tamil Nadu, the poor did not have to worry about their basic needs as a result of the Public Distribution System. But with an ‘insistence’ on electronic authentication, I fear that many an elderly or disabled person will face hunger. There should be an alternative way to supply provisions when the machine does not work .

386,2020/10/19,The global pandemic and its impact on journalism,"While the impact has been mostly negative, there is some good news too

The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on every sector. Its impact on journalism is immense. Economists have given us sufficient warnings about how the lack of reliable data in India hurts the most vulnerable. Just as we do not have data on migrant labourers, we do not have any data on COVID-19’s impact on Indian journalism. But a global survey gives us an indication of the cost extracted by the pandemic from the world of journalism.

The International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) and Columbia’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism started the ‘Journalism and the Pandemic’ survey to understand how members of the media are faring in these trying times. The authors of this project are Julie Posetti, an award-winning journalist and academic who leads the ICFJ’s global research programme; Emily Bell, Founding Director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School; and Peter Brown, Research Director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism. They surveyed 1,406 English-speaking journalists and news workers from 125 countries with the aim of providing a meaningful and actionable snapshot of the challenges faced by journalists in the first few months after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.

Many threats

Thirty per cent of the respondents who were reporting in the field during the first wave of the outbreak said their news organisations did not supply them with a single piece of recommended protective equipment. Forty-five per cent said they did not receive a face mask; 49% said they were not given hand sanitisers; and 85% said they did not receive appropriate technical equipment such as extendable boom microphones and telescopic lenses that would have enabled them to conduct interviews at a safe distance.

The survey found other threats too. Seventy per cent of the respondents rated the psychological and emotional impacts of dealing with the COVID-19 crisis as the most difficult aspect of their work, and 82% reported having at least one negative emotional or psychological reaction as a result of the pandemic. Two-thirds of the respondents reported multiple negative mental health impacts. Twenty per cent said their experience of online abuse, harassment, threats or attacks was “much worse than usual”.

The question of false balance comes out in a critical manner in the survey. In their report, ‘How are we feeling?’, the authors write: “Readers have been outraged at the commissioning of dangerously inflammatory opinion columns under the justification that it’s important to expose readers to a range of views.” Reliance on platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook saw a sharp increase as reporters depended on remote sourcing rather than being a witness. Many questions emerge from this development: “Are they more like public meetings or private conversations? How secure are they? And what are the ethical implications of dependence on tech platforms for building communities?”

The survey also said that “politicians and elected officials were identified by 46% of the respondents as a top source of disinformation, along with government agencies and their representatives (25%), and State-linked troll networks (23%), highlighting a serious lack of trust in political and governmental actors as the pandemic took hold.” It identified Facebook as a “prolific disinformation vector” (66%). Over one-third (35%) also found the Facebook-owned closed-messaging app WhatsApp as a top spreader; 11% of the respondents identified Instagram, also Facebook-owned, as a top enabler; 9% cited Facebook Messenger; and 42% cited Twitter as a “prolific disinformation spreader”.

Some positive findings

Amidst this generally depressing news, there were some positive findings too. Forty-three per cent of the respondents reported that audience trust in their journalism had increased during the first wave of the pandemic and 38% said they had experienced increased audience engagement (which was also largely positive) during the period. And 61% expressed an increased commitment to journalism as a result of the pandemic.

Most respondents want to alter the publishing environment in favour of high-quality reporting, and governments and civil society organisations to reaffirm a belief in the value of critical, independent journalism.

387,2020/10/19,Coronavirus | Lawyers may travel on local trains in Mumbai for work,"Maharashtra government responds to High Court

The Maharashtra government on Monday told the Bombay High Court that it has decided to increase the number of local trains and all lawyers may use them but only for professional reasons, to prevent crowding during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Comment | Making public transport safe during COVID-19

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a couple of public interest litigations stating that services rendered by advocates were essential services. Hence, lawyers should be included in the list of essential staff permitted to travel on special suburban/local trains.

Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said the State is in favour of allowing all lawyers to travel in local trains but only for professional purposes. He also said that currently all women were being allowed to use the trains during non-peak hours.

He said a meeting was scheduled with the Bar council of Maharashtra later this week to look into the request made by the lawyers.

The court then said the State must also think of allowing people from all sectors and walks of life to use the trains while ensuring all COVID-19 safeguards were followed.

The Bench said, “The opening up of services and offices has to correspond with the transport services. Someone whose sector has opened up must be allowed to travel.”

State Helpline numbers for COVID-19

On October 9, Mr. Kumbhakoni had said the State did not have any objection to increase the frequency of local trains and that even the general public could use the services provided they wore masks and followed social distancing norms.

On September 15, the A-G had said advocates who need to be present in court could obtain a certificate from the Registrar concerned and get railway travel passes from September 18 till October 7 on an experimental basis.",,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/99fdhz/article32893904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-MUMBAI-TRAIN-VBj,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/lawyers-may-travel-on-local-trains-in-mumbai-for-work/article32893871.ece

Calling upon the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to desist from playing politics over the devastation wrought by the retreating monsoon, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday assured farmers that the “Maha Vikas Aghadi” government would not leave them in the lurch.

Also read: Maharashtra rain: Centre must step in to help farmers, says Pawar

Speaking after visiting parts of rain-wracked Solapur district, Mr. Thackeray said the State government had not announced details of an assistance package yet simply because the crisis was not yet over.

“I have not yet made any announcement as the crisis is not yet over. We are collecting information regarding the extent of crop and property damage, the process of panchanamas [assessing damages] is already under way. We have already started providing immediate financial assistance to the families of those who have died in rain-related incidents,” he said. It was pointless announcing something in a hurry as the Meteorological department had forecast more rains till October 24, he said.

Stating that the priority for the administration now is to avoid any further loss of life, Mr. Thackeray appealed to farmers not to despair of their situation while remarking that the State government would approach the Centre for any help needed.

“The State government will leave no stone unturned in helping farmers. If needed, only then we will be approaching the Centre for financial assistance. I have had a phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday who has assured me of every possible help,” he said, exhorting the Opposition not to transform the crisis into a “Centre versus State” scenario.

The politics over excess rain was in full force with former Chief Minister and BJP’s Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis pointedly commencing his tour of rain-hit areas from Baramati — the bastion of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Sharad Pawar.

Mr. Fadnavis criticised the Thackeray government for allegedly waiting for the Centre to step in without declaring financial assistance of its own accord.

“The Centre will help. It has done so in the past and will continue to do so in the future as well. Prime Minister Modi, too, has assured Maharashtra of all help. But why isn’t the State declaring its own assistance package? Last year, we had announced a ₹10,000-crore package at the time of the Sangli-Kolhapur floods without waiting for the Centre to declare aid,” said Mr. Fadnavis.

Mr. Thackeray, without naming Mr. Fadnavis, said in Solapur instead of canvassing for the Bihar polls (where Mr. Fadnavis had been appointed incharge), all of us together should be seeking relief for Maharashtra’s farmers to the Centre.

“We have started giving immediate relief to the rain-afflicted... The Centre is not a ‘foreign’ government. It is the Centre’s duty to come to the aid of any State suffering from a natural calamity. And I think after my phone call with Mr. Modi, I am convinced that if we request the Prime Minister for aid, he will never refuse us,” said the Chief Minister, urging the Opposition not to indulge in political mud-slinging.

Mr. Thackeray sought to dispel the perception, being reinforced by the State BJP leadership, of his not being on the field to monitor the situation.

“I have been continuously monitoring this situation and have been in constant communication with authorities. It isn’t as if I have come to be aware of it just today,” he said, assuring farmers that he would be visiting afflicted regions on Tuesday and Wednesday as well.

Earlier, Mr. Pawar, too, had attempted to defend the Chief Minister by saying the MVA leadership had decided that Mr. Thackeray should remain at a central place to monitor the situation.

“We had advised him [Mr. Thackeray] to remain at one place while the other leaders would be touring the afflicted regions…after all, the person who holds all the administrative threads must stay at one place to make decisions,” Mr. Pawar said in Tuljapur.

Stressing that there was no administrative failure, Mr. Thackeray also said the showers, not seen by farmers in decades, were falling with a peculiar intensity.

In response, Mr. Fadnavis hit out at the Chief Minister and the MVA government remarking that it was unfortunate that it was left to a senior leader like Mr. Pawar to defend the shortcomings of the MVA government.

He claimed that it was only after the BJP leaders had declared their tours that the guardian Ministers of the ruling MVA government had belatedly announced their visits.

Visiting Maladgaon in Baramati, Mr. Fadnavis said: “This is a deplorable situation. In the last eight days, no one from the district administration has made contact with the villagers. There is no aid for them. There is no electricity here as the pole has been washed away in the flood. If this village, right under the nose of the State government, is in this awful state, then one can only imagine the condition of rain-hit villages in the Marathwada.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/o3r5zs/article32743013.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/will-help-flood-hit-people-in-whatever-way-possible-uddhav-thackeray/article32892249.ece
389,2020/10/19,"Monsoon havoc | Maharashtra must borrow to cope with ‘unprecedented economic crisis’, says Pawar","The NCP chief said the losses were considerably higher in some districts such as Osmanabad, Latur, Nanded, Solapur and Pune.

The agricultural devastation wrought by the retreating monsoon had thrust Maharashtra in the grip of an unprecedented economic crisis, said Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Monday while urging the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to take loans in order to pull out farmers of the present financial mire.

“I will be making an earnest request to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in this regard. The State government will have to borrow and secure maximum loans to compensate for loss of agricultural land. I see no other alternative to ameliorate the present situation,” said Mr. Pawar, observing that the excess rains had not only ravaged croplands but had also wrecked village infrastructure besides killing innumerable livestock.

The NCP chief was speaking in Tuljapur in rain-wracked Osmanabad district on the second day of his tour of the afflicted areas in the State’s Marathwada region.

He said while many districts in the State had been hit hard by heavy showers, the losses were considerably higher in some districts such as Osmanabad, Latur, Nanded, Solapur and Pune.

‘Soybean, sugarcane drop damaged’

“In certain tehsils in these acutely-afflicted districts, the destruction wrought is unimaginable…while crops like soybean and sugarcane have rotted or been damaged, the swollen rivers and streams have destroyed pipelines while washing away fertile agricultural soil and destroying village roads. Had only the crops been damaged, the effect may have been limited to the next sowing season, but this time, the entire agricultural system has been smashed by the excess rains,” Mr. Pawar said, expressing concern that farmers would be facing grave challenges in the near future.

He said that the State government would have to make heavy investments to revive the rural infrastructure rendered decrepit by the retreating monsoon showers. It was imperative for the Centre to step in and help the State government in this critical hour.

“This is an economic crisis of historic proportions that has befallen Maharashtra. While the State government is doing whatever it can, can it cope single-handedly? The Centre will have to help the State’s farmers,” said the former Union Agriculture Minister.

‘Everyone must unite’

Mr. Pawar said that he had heard that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a phone conversation with Mr. Thackeray, had assured of help to Maharashtra’s farmers.

“Everyone must come together to help Maharashtra…During elections, we politicians may hurl barbs at each other, but we have to unite in moments of crises. At the time of the 2001 earthquake in Bhuj in Gujarat, the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had handed over the responsibility of organising relief to me. Despite being the leader of the BJP, which was in power at the Centre, he [Mr. Vajpayee] never discriminated politicians along party lines,” he said.

Responding to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis’ tour of rain-hit Baramati (the bastion of the Pawar clan), Mr. Pawar said that the former Chief Minister was welcome to visit.

“If anyone is doing something to help farmers, it is welcome. They need all the help they can get.”

At the same time, in a pointed remark directed at the Opposition’s criticism of the ruling MVA government, Mr. Pawar said that the BJP in the State seemed to believe they had a magic wand to resolve this crisis immediately.

“If that is the case, then we request that they [Opposition BJP] also teach us a little magic in private to enable us to help afflicted farmers,” said the NCP chief.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/2ncpdg/article32673722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Copyofth22-alGON7PKQDJ3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/monsoon-havoc-maharashtra-must-borrow-to-cope-with-unprecedented-economic-crisis-says-pawar/article32891022.ece

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the fight against the novel coronavirus outbreak was at a decisive stage and people must adhere to all social distancing norms strictly, including wearing masks.

Mr. Thackeray was speaking while inaugurating a plasma treatment centre in Ratnagiri at an e-function on Sunday. He asked officials to ensure that the State government’s ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign creates awareness of following COVID-19 norms. “We have to ensure that there is no second COVID-19 wave,” he said at the gathering.

With Mr. Thackeray scheduled to visit rain-affected areas in Solapur district on Monday, State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil on Sunday took a dig at the Chief Minister, saying that he is now venturing out of his house as he is continuously being criticised by the Opposition party for not going out due to the pandemic. “A government can be run only by being on the field as it helps in quick decision-making. Not all decisions can be taken through video-conferencing,” Mr. Patil said.

He said the Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, Devendra Fadnavis, will undertake a 800-km tour of the flood-hit parts of the State starting Monday. “We expect financial assistance to be provided expeditiously.

Over 6,000 patients in Maharashtra have so far benefited from the government’s recently introduced online medical consultation portal, eSanjeevaniOPD, by availing themselves of free online medical check-ups and expert advice.

The digital platform, developed by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing in Mohali, enables patient-to-doctor teleconsultation.

The State government has now added a fresh time slot for eSanjeevaniOPD and made the service available twice a day. Now, residents of Maharashtra can avail of online medical check-ups, and seek advice between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. in addition to the existing 9:30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. slot.

The mobile application was pressed into service four months ago and has been catering to patients across the State.

Using a desktop computer, laptop or smartphone, people residing in any district can connect with medical experts and seek advice on any illness.

Medical experts have been able to provide instant help and recommend treatment to 6,072 patients in the State so far.

The Union Ministry for Health and Family Welfare rolled out the eSanjeevaniOPD service in April following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and made it a full-fledged service within a month through the website: www.esanjeevaniopd.in

Patients can download the eSanjeevani mobile app from the Google Play Store and fill up the online registration form.

After entering the mobile number and uploading documents and medical reports related to the ailment, patients will receive a one time password to complete the registration. They will then receive a token number through SMS to log in for the e-appointment.

Soon, they will receive a video call from the doctor available. After the consultation, patients will receive an e-prescription on the app.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jvh814/article32888108.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BMDoctor-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/over-6000-patients-benefit-from-esanjeevaniopd/article32888109.ece
392,2020/10/19,Gokul enters UHT treated Tetra Pak milk segment,"Product priced at ₹64 a litre in Mumbai

Gokul, a packed milk and its derivative brand, has forayed into the Ultra High Temperature treated Tetra Pak milk segment under the brand ‘Gokul Select’ to capitalise on the demand for the product since the outbreak of COVID-19 in India.

With an annual turnover of ₹2,500 crore and presence in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Goa, Gokul has introduced the new product with a six months’ shelf life in Mumbai at ₹64 a litre.

It has lined up plans to enter Pune, Delhi NCR, Himachal Pradesh, Northeast India, Goa and the rest of Maharashtra, where fresh milk supply is a challenge.

“Mumbai has a huge cosmopolitan population with buying behaviour shifting towards Tetra Pak milk due to high shelf life. It is easy to use and gives customers the opportunity to stock the product for monthly supply,” said Ravindra Apte, chairman, Kolhapur Zilla Sahakari Dudh Utpadak Sangh Ltd, the producer of Gokul brand Tetra Pak milk. “This pattern has seen a huge jump during COVID-19 and lockdown while following social distancing norms.”

Gokul will use its existing dealers and retailers for distribution of Tetra Pak milk. It plans to boost sales through online and modern trade channels, he said.

“In U.S. and Europe, the use of fresh milk is low and Tetra Pak milk consumption is very high. India is moving in the same direction steadily. During the nationwide lockdown, consumption of Tetra Pak milk has gone up significantly in India and we are sure that Gokul Select will do well,” Mr. Apte said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gokul-enters-uht-treated-tetra-pak-milk-segment/article32888091.ece
393,2020/10/19,2 held for stealing TV sets from hotel under renovation,"They loaded the stolen items in an autorickshaw and fled the scene

Navi Mumbai Crime Branch’s Central unit has arrested two men for allegedly stealing 10 smart television sets from a hotel last month.

The accused have been identified as Salman Khan (45), a resident of Mankhurd, and Satyam Harijan, (22), a resident of Nallasopara. The duo broke into The Hill View Residency in Nerul on the intervening night of September 9 and 10.

The hotel was undergoing renovation and the duo stole 10 TVs, a computer desktop and bathroom fittings such as towel racks and jet sprays from 15 rooms.

Workers renovating the hotel found the items missing the next day and alerted the owner. The CBD Belapur police registered a case and the Crime Branch initiated a parallel investigation.

Duo nabbed in Lonavala

“With the help of CCTV footage, we identified the accused, who were history-sheeters. We alerted our informers and nabbed the duo in Lonavala based on a tip-off,” said senior police inspector Nivrutti Kolhatkar. The police said the accused broke windows to enter the hotel. They then loaded the stolen items into an autorickshaw and fled the scene. “The auto driver is wanted in the case,” assistant police inspector Rajesh Gajjal said.

The police said the accused were planning to sell the TVs, but hid them at Mr. Harijan’s house in Nallasopara when they learnt that the police were on the lookout for them. They then fled to Lonavala and took up odd jobs there. The police are yet to recover the stolen items.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2-held-for-stealing-tv-sets-from-hotel-under-renovation/article32888069.ece

395,2020/10/19,Told or said?,"Both mean the same thing, but something makes them different.

Sometimes, we use the word, ‘said’ and sometimes ‘told’.

“My mother told me to eat up the pudding.”

Can you also say, “My mother said me to eat up the pudding?”

Doesn’t sound quite right, does it?

So when do we use ‘said’ and when ‘told’?

When the sentence mentions who the listener is, we use the word, ‘told.’ In the sentence we just read, we know who the listener is. The listener is ‘me.’

My mother told my brother, “You can’t have any more pudding.”

Here the listener is ‘my brother,’ So you can’t say, “My mother said my brother…”

The teacher told Kumar, “Stop looking out of the window.”

Here the listener is Kumar. So ‘told’ is used.

On the other hand

Then, when do we use ‘said’? When the sentence does not mention who the listener is.

The rat said, “Oh, dear! The cat is out of the bag.”

This sentence does not tell us who the rat is talking to. We only know that the rat has said something.

So we use ‘said’, and not ‘told’.

The speaker said, “Please don’t sleep.”

Here again, the sentence does not mention who the listener or listeners are. So we go with ‘said.’ If the listener is included in the sentence, then it would read something like this: The speaker told his audience, “Please don’t sleep.”

But if you really want to use the word ‘said’ when the name of the listener is included in the sentence, you can say, ‘said to’. Then the sentence would read: The speaker said to his audience, “Please don’t sleep”.

Like most rules, this one too has exceptions. When talking about jokes, lies, the truth and stories, ‘told’ is used even though the listeners are not mentioned:

She told jokes.

He told a lie.

He told the truth.

She told a story.

Thankfully, not too many exceptions!",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/told-or-said/article32891168.ece
396,2020/10/19,Dispelling darkness,"Mihir is upset that there are no Dussehra festivities this year, but his parents suggest an alternate plan instead.

Mihir, who was lost in his thoughts, was suddenly jolted by his mom’s voice, “What happened? Why do you look so sad?”

“I was thinking that this year, we will not be able to attend the Dussehra festivities like the previous years. No carnival, no Ravan. All the fun will be missing.” Mihir sounded despondent.

“Yes, but adherence to social distancing is more important, in view of the pandemic,” Mom tried to be reasonable. Mihir looked at her; he could not disagree, but was not convinced.

Mom did not say anything more, but understood Mihir’s disappointment. The Dussehra carnival was a fun event, and all the kids used to wait with great anticipation every year.

Together with friends

When Dad noticed Mihir looking sad, he offered, “Why don’t you call a few of your friends for lunch? We can also have few rounds of carrom and ludo.”

Mihir jumped with joy and hugged his dad.

He immediately rang five of his close friends who were more than eager to join him for lunch and games.

“So, what would you like for your lunch?” Mom asked Mihir.

“Anything you prepare is simply superb. You seem to have a magic wand in your hand. I know you will prepare some mouthwatering delicacies,” Mihir.

“I will prepare fried rice and manchurian,” Mom proposed.

“Oh yes! That will be fantastic. My friends will love it,” said an excited Mihir.

As the doorbell rang, Mihir rushed to open the door and found his friends waiting.

Soon, the entire household was echoing with their uninhibited laughter. Everyone was excited and happy to meet each other after a long time.

“I hope all of you were wearing your masks while leaving the house,” Mihir’s father enquired.

“Of course, uncle! We must ensure others’ safety as well,” Amul displayed his mask.

Amit was next to add, “And now, regular hand wash has also become a habit.”

Ranjan smiled, “And it is so surprising that he never used to wash his hands even before lunch at school.”

Soon, Mom entered the room with a large plate full of hot samosas. The enchanting smell was tempting, and all the boys pounced on the plate.

Dad interjected, “Have your samosas in peace and then we can have a round or two of carrom.”

Mihir once again raised his sore point: the Dussehra festival. “We will not be able to see the effigy of Ravan being burnt this year.”

Ankit agreed with him, “I always wait for the event for months but, sadly, we will not be able to enjoy Dussehra.”

All his friends were silent.

Mihir’s dad intervened, “Can anyone explain why we celebrate Dussehra and burn an effigy of Ravan?”

Nitin replied, “Ravan is considered a symbol of evil, and burning of his effigy denotes the end of all evils.”

“So, what is the biggest evil we are witnessing right now?” Dad asked again.

“CORONA!” the children yelled in unison.

“Yes. It has brought our lives to a grinding halt,” Dad continued.

Overcoming the evil

“Why don’t we resolve to overcome this evil?” Mihir was quite excited.

“Those who do not wear masks can be convinced about the utility and importance of using them. Once the pandemic is controlled, we can have a great Dussehra next year,” Nitin proposed.

“And we can definitely enjoy the festival while following norms of social distancing and safety on Dussehra as well,” Mom offered her advice.

“Of course, and we can have a grand Dussehra party at my home,” Amul smiled.

“Let us plan for a Dussehra party then, over fried rice and manchurian,” Mom replied

“Oh yes!” Mihir clapped his hands.

“And my Dussehra party will not be as enjoyable without these delicacies too, ” Amul said and the room filled up with loud laughter and giggles.",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/xopywt/article32891145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23YTTALESPINLead,https://www.thehindu.com/children/dispelling-darkness/article32891147.ece

398,2020/10/19,"e-Dussehra, anyone?","Do you think, like everything else, Navaratri will go online too? Well, that doesn’t sound too bad.

It’s the festive season, folks! Well, that’s what the ads in the newspapers say. It doesn’t feel like there’s much to celebrate right now though, does it? Plus, even if I was in the mood to celebrate, exactly how am I supposed to? I’m not sure it’s a great idea to go pandal hopping or visit friends just yet. So does that mean, like everything else in life right now, Dussehra will go online too? While that sounds kind of awful, if you think about it, it might not be all bad.

The bright side

Let’s look at the pros! Every year, Dussehra means nine days of wearing kurta pyjamas in the evening. Now, I have nothing against kurta pyjamas but it would be great if they were made of dry-fit. Plus, since I hardly wear kurtas, apart from festivals and Independence Day at school, all my sets are either two sizes too large — so I can wear them for a while — or three sizes too small because we haven’t gotten around to buying me a new one yet! Either way, not comfortable.

The reason I have to wear the kurta pyjama every day is that I have to go with Amma to all neighbourhood homes that have kept ‘golu’ or are doing special something for Navratri. Now, I didn’t mind seeing golus when I was a baby, but I’m in middle school now. Miniature cricket pitches made from sprouting coriander seeds aren’t really my thing any more. Plus, all the Aunties pinch your cheeks and say ‘You’ve grown so tall!’, ‘You’ve become so thin!’, ‘You have become so dark!’. UUUUUGH! NOT COOL, AUNTIES! Please keep your hands and opinions to yourself!

After they’ve told you exactly what they think of how you look, they’ll give you a guided tour of their golu, and you have to have a bunch of handy adjectives ready. Mumbling ‘wow’ and ‘cool’ just won’t cut it. ‘Amazing!’, ‘outstanding’, ‘mind-blowing’ are the need of the hour. Makes you wish you’d paid more attention to literary devices in English class.

Once you’ve gotten the grand tour, you’ll be asked to sing. It doesn’t matter if you can or can’t, want to or don’t. And they don’t mean Imagine Dragons or Camilla Cabello or Shawn Mendes; they mean classical music. How do I know? Because last year I sang ‘Señorita’, and the look on Amma and all the aunties’ faces made it very clear that that was not the correct song to sing. Try Lizzo at your own peril.

If we’re celebrating e-Navratri or e-Golu or e-Dussehra, you can just say there was a network issue, or that your camera isn’t working, or that the Mahishasura e-virus corrupted your laptop. The possibilities are endless.

The only con of e-Navratri? How am I going to enjoy all that amazing prasad? Do you think I can ask the Aunties to Dunzo it over?",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/9cxx7m/article32888805.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23ytbug-boy,https://www.thehindu.com/children/e-dussehra-anyone/article32888806.ece
399,2020/10/19,A strange feeling,"Why does Mummy keep Nana’s bedroom locked if no one is there? Does Nana’s ghost still live there?

The story so far:When Nana can’t fulfil Konica’s request of getting Ranbir Kapoor’s number, she invites him for a meeting to prove that he’s really a ghost.

They hadn’t bargained for this. The colour faded from their faces.

“You little creeps! This was your stupid idea!” exploded Konica. “I’m out of this.”

“You can’t go!” shouted Maya angrily. “Why blame us? It was you, Konica Di! You invited him here. Now, even if you go away, he’s going to find you.”

So the meeting was fixed for Sunday evening, but the place Nana suggested made even Maya’s stomach flip.

“Your Nana’s bedroom?!” said Konica. “Couldn’t we meet him anywhere else?”

“Like?” Rocky shrugged.

“The children’s park.”

“But everyone would come to know. And they might just frighten Nana away,” said Maya worriedly and continued, “I haven’t been into that room ever since Nana went away. It feels strange.”

Suspicious activity

“What sort of strange, Maya?” asked Konica.

“But why would a room feel different?” asked Rocky.

Maya’s response made both Konica and Rocky’s hair stand on end.

“Nana’s bedsheet. Mummy complains it always gets dirty.”

“Like someone might have slept on it?” asked Konica. “Did you notice anything suspicious?”

“How, Konica Di? Mummy keeps the room locked.”

“Nobody puts a lock on a door inside a house unless they don’t want anyone to enter,” said Konica.

“Mummy sometimes puts flowers on Nana’s picture. Now that you mention it,” Maya’s eyes became round. “Yesterday, I saw her go into the room with a big glass of milk and close the door behind her.”

“Aunty takes milk for Nana’s ghost,” frowned Konica.

By then, Maya had begun to feel squeamish. No doubt Nana was a ghost but the prospect of him living in his own bedroom, right next to hers, made her very uncomfortable.

The next day, the children decided to meet at Maya’s house. It was decided that Maya would get the key and unlock the door to Nana’s bedroom while her mother was having her afternoon siesta so they could enter the room.

“So what’s this new game all about?” Maya’s mother asked Rocky, as he stepped inside on Sunday evening.

400,2020/10/19,Coronavirus | 21.5% of Puducherry region’s population exposed to COVID-19,"Number of persons infected increased only by 1.5% last month, sero-survey shows

A sero-survey by the Health Department has found that around 21.5% of people residing in Puducherry region have been exposed to the novel coronavirus till September end.

The survey shows the number of people infected has increased by only around 1.5% last month as sero-surveys by Jawaharlal Institute of Postgradudate Medical Education and Research showed a rise in percentage of those infected from 5% in July to 20.7% by end of August.

“Our latest survey showed that around 21.5% of the people residing in the Union Territory got infected by COVID-19 by the end of September. In other words, one in five persons in Puducherry district showed evidence of COVID-19 infection by the end of September. It means the spread of the virus has been contained for the time,” a senior Health Department official told The Hindu.

The Department collected blood samples of 2,232 persons from across the district for SARS-CoV-2 virus antibodies. Of the total surveyed, 910 were men and 1,322 were women. A total of 482 persons were positive for the antibodies, of which 311 were women and 171 men, said an internal note prepared by the Department.

Sharing the findings of the survey, the official said unlike the study by Jipmer, the sero-survey by the Department included persons below the age group of 18 years. The positivity rate for antibodies among people up to 18 years was 24%, the official said.

The positivity in persons from 18 to 30 years was 17%, 31 to 45 years was 18%, 46 to 60 years was 24% and above 60 years was 30%. More women seemed to be infected than men. Extremes of ages were infected more and there was not much difference in the spread of the virus in urban and rural areas, the note said.

The Department was conducting a sero-survey in Karaikal, Yanam and Mahe regions. “It is an interim report and the findings will be released once the survey was completed in other regions,” said a senior official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/1awuqn/article32888598.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THSEROSURVEY-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/215-of-puducherry-regions-population-exposed-to-covid-19/article32888599.ece
401,2020/10/19,Pondicherry University rolls out MBA in financial technology,"‘India is improving its position in the global innovation ranking’

Pondicherry University has rolled out an MBA programme in Financial Technology from the academic year 2020-21.

Gurmeet Singh, Vice Chancellor of the University launched the new course of the Department of Banking Technology during the 36th Foundation Day celebrations recently.

He also opened a State-of-the-art conference hall in the Department in the presence of K. Chandrasekhara Rao, Dean, School of Management, S. Sudalaimuthu, Professor & Head, Department of Banking Technology and senior faculty.

The event was followed by a special online session on the ‘Need for industrial/ international academic collaboration under New Education Policy 2020’.

Joining the session live were Soodamani Ramalingam, School of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Hertfordshire, London and Ganapathi Subramaniam of UPS Ltd, London, UK.

Students, scholars and faculty interacted with the resource persons through the new video conferencing facility, which was set up as per the general guidelines issued by the UGC to develop virtual classroom and video conferencing facility. According to the University, teaching staff would be trained to use the technology. The video conferencing facility will dramatically improve the quality of students’ learning experience and enable them to interact with guest lecturers across the world.

402,2020/10/19,"Coronavirus | Decline in mortalities, new cases in Puducherry","High testing volume, early detection, hospitalisation of symptomatic patients reasons for turnaround

The Union Territory has recorded a dramatic decline in COVID-19 deaths over the last month with high testing volume, early detection and hospitalisation of symptomatic patients being the key reasons for the turnaround.

The ramping up of testing volumes to about 5,000 a day that helped early spotting of coronavirus infections has been one of the main reasons for the success on the morbidity and mortality counts as it has helped quicker referrals to a COVID facility while immediate isolation of the symptomatic patients cut off further transmission to others, officials said.

The Union Territory, which had carried out 2,63,481 tests to date, has covered over 17 per cent of the population so far.

For the first time in months, the Union Territory did not record any COVID-19 death on Sunday, while 177 new cases emerged from 4,072 tests. The test positivity rate was 4.34%, case fatality rate 1.73% and recovery rate 85.36%.

The infection rate of under 5% is the lowest recorded yet, said J. Ramesh, Nodal Officer for COVID-19, Health Department.

So far, July 8 was the only day that the Union Territory went without a single COVID-19 death. That the toll at that time was 14, illustrates the sharp spike in mortalities that characterised the spread of pandemic in the Union Territory since. A random time series comparison shows that deaths crossed 100 (aggregating 102) on August 14, aggregated 211 by August 30, 365 by September 12, 405 by September 15 and stood at 521 by September 30.

As of Sunday, the toll in the Union Territory stood at 574 while the cumulative total was 33,141 cases and 28,290 patients got recovered. Over 550 deaths were reported in July, August and September with the highest single-day toll of 20 deaths registered on September 5.

“The lowering of deaths and new infections is due to a combination of factors, ranging from implementation of recommendations of ICMR experts, ramping up of oxygen beds in IGMCRI and private hospitals, launching of fever clinics and the door-to-door testing by health teams to spot symptomatic patients,” said S. Mohan Kumar, Health Director.

The launch of 21 COVID-19 focus centres that screened fever patients, household outreach and clinical audit of each death to plug shortcomings within hospital setting or externally such as ambulance support for timely transportation of patients are among other reasons attributed for the success in bringing down deaths and new cases. Through August, the case fatality rate was as high as 1.98% while the test positivity rate was about 38%.

“An important aspect of bringing the pandemic under some measure of control is that even in August when there was a natural peak following abolition of e-pass, the administration did not resort to a harsh lockdown and ensured that vital sectors of the economy were up and running,” said T. Arun, Health Secretary and District Collector.

Meanwhile, an assessment of the COVID status in the Union Territory as of October 13 by the Health Department showed that almost 40% of the deaths occurred when the patient admission was between 24 hours and 48 hours.

However, what should concern the health authorities is that almost 33% of deaths were occurring during hospitalisation ranging from two to seven days and 25.57% of deaths happened even when the period of hospitalisation exceeded a week.

An interesting phenomenon of COVID-19 mortality has been that substantially more women than men were falling victim to the infection. The status check showed that 68.77% of the victims were women against 31.22% men.

Age-wise stratification of deaths showed that 57.19% of the victims were above 60 years of age, 24.56% in the 51-60 years age range and 17.19% in the age bracket of 31-50 years.

In terms of co-morbidities, diabetes mellitus emerged the most dangerous co-existing condition for COVID-19 patients accounting for over half of all deaths in the Union Territory.

Diabetes was an underlying condition in 52.28% of victims followed by hypertension (37.36%). Curiously, COVID-19 was fatal for only 5.61% of patients with respiratory illness, the data showed.

“The challenge now is to sustain the good work of the past weeks,” Mr. Arun added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vzw6hx/article32888842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THRAPIDANTIGENTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/decline-in-mortalities-new-cases-in-ut/article32888413.ece

404,2020/10/19,Euro Leagues | Barkley’s strike ensures Villa’s unbeaten run continues,"Real Sociedad tops LaLiga after blanking Real Betis after unpredictable start to the season

Aston Villa claimed a fourth straight win to open the Premier League season as Ross Barkley scored in stoppage time to secure a 1-0 victory over Leicester.

Having scored seven goals against Liverpool before the international break, Villa just needed one to maintain its 100% start and move a point behind first-place Everton with a game in hand.

Barkley collected a pass from John McGinn, drove forward and sent in a shot from 25 yards that found the bottom corner in the first minute of added-on time at the King Power Stadium.

Touch and go

“It was touch and go whether he started today,” Villa manager Dean Smith said. “He had a knock to the knee but (it was) a great goal and a real battling performance by the whole team.”

The England midfielder has scored in both of his games since joining on loan from Chelsea.

It was a game of few clear-cut chances, with fourth-place Leicester lacking a cutting edge without injured striker Jamie Vardy.

Its best opportunity fell to Timothy Castagne, whose shot from an acute angle was smothered by Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez in the first half.

Real Sociedad continued La Liga’s unpredictable start to the season by going top of the table on Sunday, after a 3-0 win away at Real Betis.

Villarreal had temporarily claimed first place earlier in the day by beating Valencia 2-1 at la Ceramica but Real Sociedad’s impressive victory put it ahead on goal difference.

Real Sociedad took advantage as Cristian Portu and Adnan Januzaj scored goals either side of Mikel Oyarzabal converting a penalty to consign Betis to a third defeat in four games under new coach Manuel Pellegrini. It drops to sixth.

Portu put Sociedad ahead shortly before halftime and Betis thought it had levelled early in the second period through Antonio Sanabria but the goal was ruled out for a marginal offside following a video review. Sanabria was then denied a penalty following another VAR review after grappling with Sociedad’s Robin Le Normand in the area and having his shirt torn by the French defender.

Betis’s disbelief deepened when Sociedad was awarded a penalty for a challenge by Marc Bartra on Alexander Isak and Oyarzabal converted from the spot.

Januzaj put an extra shine on the win with a superb late strike into the roof of the net from a tight angle after latching on to a pass from Isak.

The results: Premier League: Leicester 0 lost to Aston Villa 1 (Barkley 90).

LaLiga: Alaves 0 lost to Elche 2 (Milla Pena 39, Morente 86); SD Huesca 2 (Mir 52, Ramirez 56) drew with Valladolid 2 (Gonzalez 35, Rubio 51-pen); Real Betis 0 lost to Real Sociedad 3 (Portu 44, Oyarzabal 73-pen, Januzaj 88).

Serie A: Udinese 3 (Samir 28, Iacopini 52-og, Pussetto 89) bt Parma 2 (Hernani 26, Karamoh 70); Roma 5 (Pedro 31, Dzeko 35, 77, Veretout 69-pen, Perez 89) bt Benevento 2 (Caprari 5, Lapadula 55).

405,2020/10/19,Champions League | ‘Maestro’ Pirlo faces mentor Lucescu in opener,"Barca not among favourites, says Koeman; PSG to tackle United’s counter-attacks

Andrea Pirlo takes his first managerial steps in the Champions League at Dynamo Kiev on Tuesday, a game which pits the fledgling Juventus coach against his vastly experienced former mentor Mircea Lucescu.

Lucescu, 75, with four decades of coaching experience, and 41-year-old Pirlo have both taken over their respective clubs this season.

It was the former Romanian international who gave a 16-year-old Pirlo his first Serie A start in the Italian’s hometown club Brescia 25 years ago.

Juventus is chasing a third Champions League title after 1985 and 1996, with seven runner-up finishing including in 2015 and 2017.

But for Pirlo, his Juventus is “under construction, a young team who need to gain experience”.

To complicate the task, Cristiano Ronaldo is quarantined because of coronavirus, and will miss the Kiev trip and possibly the game against Barcelona in Turin.

Meanwhile, Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman believes his side is not among the favourites to win this season’s title.

Speaking ahead of Tuesday’s visit of Hungarians Ferencvaros in their Champions league Group G opener, Koeman played down media talk that the Catalans could be European champion.

“When you’re at Barcelona you always want to be there fighting for trophies, be it in LaLiga or Europe. We aren’t the favourites, but we can go far,” he told a news conference.

The Ferencvaros game comes four days before the first Clasico of the season at home to Real Madrid but Koeman said his side is only focusing on the Champions League for now.

No ter Stegen

Koeman will be without goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Jordi Alba plus long-term injury absentee Samuel Umtiti.

Paris St. Germain will concentrate on combating Manchester United’s counter-attacks in its opener, 18 months after a heart-breaking elimination by the English side in Europe’s premier club competition.

Coach Thomas Tuchel warned that previous achievements would mean nothing on Tuesday at the Parc des Princes, where PSG’s all-time top scorer Edinson Cavani could debut for the visitor.

PSG will not have it easy as it is without injured mid-fielders Marco Verratti and Argentine Leandro Paredes, with the Italian out of action for three weeks with a thigh problem.

In addition, Argentina striker Mauro Icardi is absent with a knee problem, while the defensive pair of Thilo Kehrer and Juan Bernat is also on the sidelines.

Chelsea manager Frank Lampard believes reigning European champion Bayern Munich is a benchmark for his young players as it targets improvements on all fronts ahead of its opener against Sevilla.

Chelsea has added Champions League experience to the squad in the close season with the arrival of defender Thiago Silva and forwards Kai Havertz, Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech.

Sevilla visits Stamford Bridge for Chelsea’s first match in Group E.

Fans for Leipzig

Meanwhile, RB Leipzig will be allowed to welcome fans to the Red Bull Arena for its opener against Istanbul Basaksehir.

Despite rising numbers of coronavirus cases across Germany, the local health authority in Leipzig has granted permission for up to 999 spectators to attend, down from the usual number of 8,500 fans allowed for home Bundesliga games.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/ib5q23/article32895216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20CHAMP,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/champions-league-maestro-pirlo-faces-mentor-lucescu-in-opener/article32895217.ece
406,2020/10/19,Tottenham collapses on Bale's return to draw 3-3 vs West Ham,"It was the second straight league game at home where Tottenham had thrown away a winning position after being held 1-1 by Newcastle three weeks ago after conceding a penalty.

Tottenham was transformed by Gareth Bale’s homecoming, just not in the way that Jose Mourinho had imagined.

Cruising 3-0 when Bale came off the bench in the 72nd minute against West Ham, Tottenham incredibly collapsed in a game it had been in control of to draw 3-3 in the Premier League on Sunday.

It was with almost the last kick of the game that Manuel Lanzini blasted a shot from distance into the roof of the net to snatch a point that seemed extremely unlikely when Son Heung-min scored in the first minute and Harry Kane netted twice by the 16th minute.

“It’s difficult to believe — we lost two points, threw them away,” Mourinho said.

Agonizingly for Bale, after Fabiŕn Balbuena’s header in the 82nd and Davinson Sŕnchez’s own-goal three minutes later, the on-loan forward from Real Madrid had a golden chance to score Tottenham’s fourth.

Released by Kane, Bale sent Angelo Ogbonna sliding to the turf as he drilled into the penalty area but managed to drag a shot wide.

“It’s a pity he couldn’t score the fourth goal that could kill the game,” Mourinho said. “The decision not to start him I think was a good decision, a decision to show that he doesn’t have a beautiful chair waiting for him in the team and he sits there the first time he can. It was a message to the team that in this team everybody has to fight for positions.”

Rather than any joy for Bale on his return to Tottenham after seven years, it was a player brought on even later than the Welshman who ended up celebrating. It seemed unimaginable in the first half that the game would end with Lanzini ripping off his shirt and the visiting players piling on top of each other with West Ham manager David Moyes charging onto the pitch deliriously.

“For some reason they didn’t push on in the second half, try to kill off the game,” West Ham midfielder Declan Rice said. “Once we got one we had to believe we could come back to draw or win.”

It was the second straight league game at home where Tottenham had thrown away a winning position after being held 1-1 by Newcastle three weeks ago after conceding a penalty. But that was followed by a League Cup win over Chelsea, a 7-2 rout of Maccabi Haifa in the Europa League and 6-1 dismantling of Manchester United before the international break.

Spurs were as ruthless as they were at Old Trafford, initially, in this London derby.

Just 48 seconds had elapsed when Kane released Son to curl in the opener. The pair combined for an eighth time this season before Kane nutmegged Rice and struck low into the net. It was Sergio Reguilūn’s cross that Kane headed in for the third.

The game was under control until Mourinho disrupted it with a trio of changes, including Bale’s arrival. Never before has a team had a 3-0 lead after 82 minutes in the Premier League and surrendered it.

“My guys were not strong enough to cope with it psychologically,” Mourinho said. “The last few seconds, we lost two points.”

Tottenham has eight points from five games to sit in sixth place as it chases a return to the Champions League with a top-four finish. West Ham is a point further back.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/vywlbz/article32889422.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKBRITAINSOCCERPREMIERLEAGUE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/tottenham-collapses-on-bales-return-to-draw-3-3-vs-west-ham/article32889423.ece

The victory parade following the handing over of I-League trophy to Mohun Bagan on Sunday witnessed gross violation of COVID-19 safety guidelines as more than 50,000 frenzied fans were seen celebrating on the city streets without any visible sign of social distancing norms.

It all began when the victory parade took off from a five-star hotel where the ceremony was held with I-League CEO Sunando Dhar handing over the trophy to some of the players and officials in the presence of club President Swapan Sadhan Bose and West Bengal Sports Minister Aroop Biswas.

The video of the parade was also uploaded on the club’s Twitter handle with caption: “Mad scenes from the Streets of #Kolkata #TrophyTour #JoyMohunBagan #Champion5“.

Incidentally, Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju tweeted on the video: “This is that famous festive football frenzy of Kolkata I like the most about! Heartiest congratulations to @Mohun_Bagan for becoming @ILeagueOfficial Champions. My best wishes for the upcoming @IndSuperLeague season as @atkmohunbaganfc“.

Mohun Bagan general secretary Srinjoy Bose said he was “concerned” but to stop the passionate fans from thronging the parade “was not in his hands”.

“I cannot stop the sentiments of hundreds of thousands of supporters. It was about the passion that came out after finally waiting to see the trophy for seven months. I’m concerned but it is not in my hands,” Bose told PTI.

“Can you stop the Durga Puja? Why has the Central Government eased the lockdown restrictions, allowed public transport? Have you seen the crowded buses? Let them stop everything, we will also abide by it. We are helpless.”

“We did not provide them anything to assemble for this procession. It was not in our hands. Fans came on their own and showed their passion,” he added.

The original plan was to hold the ceremony at their club but Mohun Bagan shifted the event to a hotel to adhere to COVID-19 guidelines.

The Mariners had clinched the I-League title on March 10 with four rounds to spare but the celebrations had to wait because of the COVID-19 pandemic that ended the season abruptly.

Two government school students who cleared the Joint Entrance Examinations (Main) with the help of students from the National Institute of Technology- Tiruchi (NIT-T), have secured seats in the same institution.

S. Pughazharasi a student from the Government Girls' Higher Secondary School in Manachanallur and P. Sethupathi, of Government Higher Secondary School, Lalgudi, were trained by a team of volunteers from IGNITTE, a teaching club comprising students of NIT-T. The students are provided with free access to resources and coaching to crack the entrance examinations.

Daughter of a single mother, who works as a teacher at an Anganwadi in Manachanallur, Ms. Pughazharasi said she was unaware about the career opportunities available after Plus Two. “I qualified for the coaching camp through an entrance examination conducted across the district. A total of 70 students were chosen and we would spend weekends and any long holidays at NIT-T preparing for the examinations,” she said.

While the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted their face-to-face training, the students were able to adjust to online classes quickly, said V. Sanjeev, one of the founders of IGNITTE. “They spent 13 to 14 hours a day preparing. They would also approach us with doubts and clarifications regularly,” he said. The students' dedication and focus led them to perform well in the examinations.

Ms. Pughazharasi said that the district administration undertook their travel, food and other miscellaneous costs to ensure that the children could prepare well for the examinations. “If not for them, I would not have qualified and I would not have been eligible to study at such a prestigious college,” she said. Her two brothers, who are also studying and her mother are ecstatic, she added. “I hope to study well and make them proud,” she added.

Both the students have secured seats in civil engineering in NIT-T after the first round of counselling. A private company in Chennai has come forward to sponsor the college fees for both the students, Mr. Sanjeev said.

“Their tuition fees, boarding and other needs would be met by the sponsors,” he added.

411,2020/10/19,Onions turn dearer; shallots touch ₹100 a kg,"Tiruchi

Prices of both the big and small varieties of onions, which started rising by mid-September, continue to head north at the wholesale market in Tiruchi.

The price of top quality shallots touched ₹100 a kg on Monday, while the Bellary variety was being sold at ₹80 a kg. Retail prices are normally ₹5 -10 a kg more than the wholesale rates.

Wholesale traders report that the prices of both the varieties have gone up by ₹25-30 a kg over the past week. With the festival season ahead, the prices are expected to go up further by another ₹20 a kg.

Traders say that arrivals of shallots have dwindled drastically over the past few days and old stocks from a few parts of the State are coming in. “We are hardly getting about 60 tonnes of shallots a day against the daily demand of about 250 tonnes,” said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders’ Association, said.

Arrivals from Perambalur and Thuraiyur belt in Tiruchi district, a major onion growing belt in the State, have come down to a trickle. Farmers in Perambalur and Thuraiyur had complained of a strange disease attack in the crop affecting the yield last season.

“We are getting about 25-30 tonnes from Perambalur and Thuraiyur and another 30 tonnes from Udumalpet and Pollachi region as some farmers and traders are clearing their old stocks,” Mr.Thangaraj said.

Arrival of Bellary variety onions have been on the decline since September due to rains in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Prior to that, the price of the variety had ruled steady at about ₹20 a kg for about three months at the Tiruchi market.

“We are getting about 200 tonnes of Bellary onions, about 100 tonnes each from Karnataka and Maharashtra, against the normal demand of about 300 tonnes. While the arrivals from Karnataka is fresh crop, those from Maharashtra largely constitute old stocks. The damage caused by the rain in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka continue to impact arrivals to Tamil Nadu,” said Mr.Thangaraj.

Traders here expect the price of the onion varieties to stabilise only after the festival season. Fresh arrivals of small onions, also known as sambar onions, from Perambalur and Thuraiyur are expected only in January.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/onions-turn-dearer-shallots-touch-100-a-kg/article32893342.ece
412,2020/10/19,Procedural hindrance delays laying of road,"The non-existence of an elected local body is said to be the stumbling block for residents of Railway Line East Street, Peravurani, in getting their long-pending demand of converting the existing mud road serving as a vital link to the town converted as a black-topped carriageway.

The mud road passing through the Railway land was being used by the residents of Railway line East Street for decades to reach Nattanikottai Road, Neelakanda Pillaiyar Kovil Weekly Shandy, Aranthangi, Sethubhavachatram and the Peravurani town for several decades.

The Railway authorities have reportedly conveyed their decision to the civic body that the mud road could be taken on lease for a decade by remitting ₹15 lakh and renew the same thereafter, sources said.

Though their plea elicited favourable response from the Peravurani Town Panchayat and the Railway officials, the ‘ineligibility’ on the part of civic body officials in taking a final call on projects/proposals involving a ‘huge amount’ has effectively stalled the proposal.

Meanwhile, the Peravurani MLA, M.Govindarasu has claimed that the plight of Railway line residents had been brought to the notice of the State government and the District Administration to get the issue sorted out at the earliest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/goyi1k/article32893169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY20ROADTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/procedural-hindrance-delays-laying-of-road/article32893170.ece
413,2020/10/19,"How to keep Plus One students engaged, teachers wonder","Having completed the process of admission of students for Class XI, teachers of government schools say they are clueless about how to keep them engaged in academics.

As per the official instructions, the admission of Plus One students was completed by the end of August. The classes are yet to officially commence for them.

Unlike in the case of Plus Two students for whom the teachers had uploaded study contents in the laptops given as freebies, the Plus One students find themselves left in the cold.

According to a senior higher secondary teacher, there has not been even telephonic interaction with students as yet. At present, the students are entirely dependent on the content delivered through the government-owned Kalvi Television channel.

Active engagement of Plus One students hinges on the early distribution of the laptops. But, that does not seem probable in the current circumstances, a headmaster observed.

Self-financing and aided institutions, on the other hand, are seemingly having a smooth sail as the subject content is being delivered for the Plus One students either in the school itself, in small batches, or through online platform, sources said.

There is a requirement of 200 working days in a year, in consonance with the quantum of content. Since a number of working days have been lost, the teachers are reconciled to the eventuality of having truncated portions. The government had, earlier this year, announced that 40% of the content will be reduced in consideration of the loss of working days. What the teachers look for from the government is early announcement of the finalised portions for the academic year.

“Teachers are in a apprehensive since the festival season ahead is bound to cause immense distraction for students. After that, teachers will be left with only a few months to complete the theory as well as practicals, besides conducting a series of revision tests in the place of quarterly and half-yearly exams. Therefore, the government must not delay announcing the truncated syllabi any longer,” another headmaster emphasised.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/how-to-keep-plus-one-students-engaged-teachers-wonder/article32893005.ece

415,2020/10/19,‘Right decision at the right time is characteristic of a leader’,"Taking the right decision at the right time is the distinctive quality of those who emerge as leaders, according to Sanjeev Sanyal, Principal Economic Advisor, Union Finance Ministry.

He made this remark while delivering the 15th City Union Bank V. Narayanan Memorial Lecture on ‘World economic history and India’s future,’ organised online by the SASTRA Deemed to be University on Sunday.

Mr. Sanyal traced the oceanic trade and economic routes that were dominated by the Mongols and Chinese and the role of the Chola empire. He cited examples of Chola temples and Puri Jagannath as places of significant religious and financial capital.

The history of economics was full of unpredictable twists and turns. “It is only those who took the right decisions at the right time emerge as leaders”, he said. Citing India’s flexible and resilient response mechanisms, Mr. Sanyal said the Indian society deserved credit for keeping COVID-19 pandemic under control and thereby ensuring economic recovery which had started “showing signs of positivism.”

Further, the Atmanirbhar policy reflects India’s flexibility towards looking at indigenously driven self-reliance in the modern sense and not in the regimental and outdated sense of the past, he added.

S.Vaidhyasubramanim, Vice-Chancellor, SASTRA Deemed University, in his welcome address recalled the efforts of V.

A large quantity of paddy harvested from fields in Marungulam and nearby villages were brought to the Marungulam DPC and stocked in the open by the farmers.

“As this area experiences showers every day, the moisture content increases automatically and some quantity of grains sprout due to water seepage despite the produce being covered with tarpaulins,” said T.Vaithiyalingam, secretary, Manavari Cultivators Association.

Hence, the DPC staff were unable to procure more than 500 bags of paddy by following the moisture content norms laid down for the procurement, he lamented.

Further, delay in the movement of procured paddy from the DPC to stockyards had also made the staff refrain from stepping up the procurement since if the paddy bags get drenched in the rain they had to face departmental action, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/tz9ntz/article32892924.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY20PADDYTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/paddy-piles-up-at-marungulam/article32892925.ece
417,2020/10/19,Kolu in the time of pandemic,"The year-end festive season got off to a start last week with Navaratri being observed from October 17 to 25. Some families in Tiruchi have arranged the traditional ‘kolu’ doll display for the auspicious nine days, despite the pandemic. But many others have decided to do away with the display this year.

“Kolu displays are the best ways to make children understand about our culture. The figurines help them to remember the legends and stories from our scriptures,” B. Vishnupriya, a homemaker from Srirangam, told The Hindu. “This year, we spent over a month preparing for the kolu display in our apartment with over 500 idols and dolls. I am expecting friends and neighbours to drop in through the week. Of course, we will be keeping the entire area sanitised and guests will be requested to wear masks and maintain a safe distance,” she added.

For homemaker Krithika Sundaraman, the five-step ‘kolu’ at her home in Srirangam will focus on religious idols and deities. “I have 30-35 big dolls in my collection; those are part of my display. A statuette of ‘Ardhanarishvara’ is a rare piece that I bought in Tiruchi,” said Ms. Sundaraman. “Though the lockdown reduced the number of stalls selling ‘kolu’ dolls, we were able to find good selections in the few shops that were open,” she added.

Poompuhar, the State-run handicrafts emporium, has been hosting a sales-cum-exhibition of ‘Kolu’ dolls at its West Boulevard showroom from September 7. “We started a little early so that shoppers could avoid crowding the store in the run-up to Navaratri,” said manager R. Gangadevi.

Sales of its terracotta, papier mache, marble, wood and leather dolls has been a little dull this year due to the lockdown at the showroom, she said. Approximately ₹8 lakh worth of dolls have been sold this year, compared to ₹20 lakh in 2019.

“Despite this, it is heartening to see people are keen on observing traditions with precautions during the lockdown,” Ms. Gangadevi said.

Many people have decided to forego the displays this year due to the pandemic alert, while keeping in touch through technology. “For the first time in 67 years, we will not be having ‘kolu’ at home, because of the safety regulations,” said Jambaga Ramakrishnan, former district chairman of the women’s voluntary organisation Inner Wheel.

While she rued the cancellation of kolu, Ms. Ramakrishnan said it was important to be socially responsible in a pandemic. “Our Inner Wheel members have decided to meet virtually on October 22, with a small video presentation of pictures from kolu displays and a song by children. This is the closest we can come to the spirit of Navaratri,” she said.

Online gatherings have helped people to commune over prayers and spiritual programmes, said dance exponent Vrindha Ramanan. “This year Navaratri will be confined to our homes, and we have cancelled the kolu display at our dance academy. But we have decided to meet virtually through the festive week. Everybody will render a dance recital from their homes,” said Ms. Ramanan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/6uze5/article32892847.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY20KOLUTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/kolu-in-the-time-of-pandemic/article32892848.ece
418,2020/10/19,Unhygienic conditions raise a stink at new fish market,"At Kasivilangi, even drainage channels have not been constructed properly

Unhygienic conditions prevail at the newly constructed Kasivilangi fish market as retail vendors sell outside the shops. With the facility inaugurated only a week ago, officials say vendors will take time to settle.

The Kasivilangi market, located three kilometres away from the Puthur Fish Market looks not too different from the old one. The parking area is inundated with slush and mud, inconveniencing customers visiting the market to purchase fish. Drainage channels have not been constructed well and large vehicles that are parked haphazardly add to the problem. Retail vendors too, have crowded the parking area with their stalls as they have not been allotted shops.

Except for the building, the market itself does not look new at all, said P. Bharathi, a resident of Woraiyur. “We may slip and fall in the slush and mud,” she said. Not stopping with shifting the market to the new place, the civic body should ensure it proper maintenance and cleanliness, she added. The market was shifted to the new location after residents and commercial establishments in Puthur raised complaints of unhygienic conditions.

Such issues could give rise to health concerns, said N. Jamaluddin, former member, State Consumer Protection Council. “At a time when the spread the novel coronavirus is yet to be contained, unhygienic areas such as the market could cause spread of infections. Why did the civic body rush to shift the vendors even without completing the construction of a shed for them?” he asked.

Unwanted parts of the fish removed by cleaners seated on the far end of the market also gave out an unbearable stench. “In the Puthur market, we had a shelter to sit under and clean. We are unable to bear the heat and the fish starts to rot giving out a bad stench,” a cleaner woman said.

Meanwhile, speaking to The Hindu, V. Rajendran, president of the Retail Fish Vendors Association said - “The wholesale merchants are not allowing us to sell fish at any of the shops. They have occupied them and are using them as office rooms and storage areas. We are left to trade in the hot sun,” he said.

“Because of the heat, vendors are losing as much as ₹50,000 each day,” he said. “Because of the direct sun, the fish begins to rot and customers do not buy them. We have sent requests to the civic body to construct a shelter but we are yet to receive a response,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/467gfa/article32892763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY20FISHTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/unhygienic-conditions-raise-a-stink-at-new-fish-market/article32892764.ece

421,2020/10/19,Auto-rickshaw drivers give social distancing norms the go-by in city,"Several auto-rickshaws are seen carrying eight to 10 passengers in various routes on a sharing basis.

Social distancing has gone for a toss in auto-rickshaws in the city. Most of the auto-rickshaws are seen overloaded with passengers for a greater part of the day and on many occasions, not just passengers, even drivers were seen without a face mask, which is mandatory.

Though RTC city buses have resumed in the city, many prefer to travel in auto-rickshaws. Lack of adequate number of RTC buses and confirmed seating are what they say as a reason for choosing the three-wheelers.

Several auto-rickshaws are seen carrying eight to 10 passengers in various routes on a sharing basis. Especially daily-wage labourers, construction workers and college students are being ferried in huge number on a share basis during peak hours. “Ninety per cent of people prefer only share journey. In case of share journeys, we cannot run the show with just two or three persons. We will eventually end up in losses,” said N. Raju, an auto-rickshaw driver from the city.

Another auto-rickshaw driver S. Murali said that COVID-19 lockdown has affected them a lot and they need to clear the debts. “We clean our vehicles before coming onto the roads in the morning. We have to maintain a sanitiser and ask people to wear mask without fail while boarding the vehicle. But during peak hours, we cannot turn them away,” he said.

K. Satyaprasad, who works at a supermarket in the city, boards an auto-rickshaw at Madhavadhara every day in the morning to Dwaraka Nagar and back home in the evening.

“I prefer to travel in auto-rickshaws because we can have a seat first. However these days it seems to be risky with passengers not wearing masks and the vehicle being overcrowded sometimes. I had a heated argument with the driver once on the issue. He asked me to get down if I had problem,” he added.

A senior police officer said that they have informed the auto-rickshaw drivers to adhere to COVID-19 norms for collective good. Drives were also conducted to ensure that all the drivers wear masks, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/cdv5kr/article32888168.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19-VZ-AUTOS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/auto-rickshaw-drivers-give-social-distancing-norms-the-go-by-in-city/article32888169.ece

423,2020/10/19,These short stories are an exploration of mortality during the pandemic,"A collection of short stories around the coronavirus pandemic, ‘Essential Items and Other Tales From a Land in Lockdown,’ by Udayan Mukherjee is a call to action for people to be kind to one another

“I shudder to think how those four months of lockdown would have passed had I not immersed myself in this project,” laughs Udayan Mukherjee, over phone from Mumbai.

The author and journalist talks about how lockdown had taken over people’s consciousness to the point where most could not even concentrate, and many experienced frustration, anxiety and anger.

Udayan, instead of caving in to these emotions opted to channel them and pen a book: Essential Items and Other Tales From a Land in Lockdown, which launched on October 18. The book is a collection of 10 fictional short stories about different people’s lives during the pandemic: in the mountains, Kolkata, Mumbai, etcetera.

“A novel did not make sense and would have been more limiting, because when you write a novel for many months you basically dip down into creating a fabric which will hold true for the telling of the story over a long period of time,” he says, adding, “In Essential Items..., each story is different from the other. Also, this was my first time writing short stories, so I was intensely getting into the heads of people for 10 or 12 days and weaning myself off, then getting into a completely different socio-economic setup for the next story. And for the reader, they may have to re-invest some emotional energy.”

Mini-chronicles

Being a market analyst in the media space, addressing how the lockdown affects different groups of people — the elderly, migrants, millennials — was central to Udayan as a writer, and ultimately these stories offer perspective to readers who may not see much of the personal traumas incited by the pandemic.

The string upon which the short stories are based on is the theme of mortality, particularly prominent in stories such as ‘A Life Or Death Situation’, ‘Border Town’, ‘Essential Items’, ‘Old Friend’ and ‘The Stroll’. “The notion of mortality creeps into different stories in different ways,” he says. One such story ‘The Stroll’ follows an elderly man on a walk through a park after many months of lockdown. He comes across his favourite jamun tree and looks around for the fruit, then realises he may not have as many jamun seasons ahead of him.

In ‘Essential Items’, an elderly woman with an ailing husband tries to make friends with a delivery girl, but the younger girl has no time to indulge the woman.

The stories also get political. ‘A Life Or Death Situation’ is about daily wage workers in Varanasi, and is also “a commentary on the caste system”, adds Udayan, as many people felt trapped in the lockdown because “such is the rigidity of casteist India that economic mobility is not very fluid”. One of the characters comments how a jolt like the pandemic can shake a person out of their rock, and it falls on the ingenuity, entrepreneurship and resourcefulness of educated people and how they make do in such a situation.

‘The Party’, meanwhile, is an observation of upper-middle class people at a party with ‘first world problems’, a much-needed wild card in the mix of deeply disconcerting narratives.

Udayan remarks he was mindful of the order of stories within Essential Items. The flow of one story into the next does take the reader on an emotional rollercoaster, but not one that is too jarring or confusing.

“I was conscious of how they surprise the reader to an extent, and that they are not lulled into thinking ‘these stories are all the same, with just changed characters’. I wanted to experiment with a little bit of shock value, which drives home the point that people are intrinsically different and the challenges that arise during this time are of a different scale and nature of difficulty but not lesser,” he adds.

Ultimately, Udayan wants people to come out of this lockdown, having read Essential Items, feeling more aware of the outer-world and to “just get out of the selfish cocoon in which we have trapped ourselves”.

King Lear by William Shakespeare

Obviously there is more drama in this; there is betrayal, hope, fury, dejection, an interesting cocktail. There is a challenge hurled at the skies, and just when nice people in the audience prepare to clap at a happy ending, why, in walks King Lear with the dead body of his innocent daughter. Had Shakespeare not placed his play in the pagan past, he might have had to answer to the Church for insinuating that God may not exist.

Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë

I love to move by a few centuries and pick up this story about a dark unknown child brought into a genteel house. He grows up on the margins of power and also whipped by power. He is driven away by all that does not belong to him. When he comes back, he uses the instruments of power that had marginalised him to empower himself. But he loses, in the process, what was most precious to him.

Dead Souls by Nikolai Gogol

If you don’t have the patience for long reads, pick up this small classic by Nikolai Gogol. We Indians would instantly identify with his Dead Souls. It is a moving story about how the dead are cultivated for profit. You will understand the global economy; and you will also understand the TRP game. Everything is conveyed indirectly in this book because the best understanding comes when it is slanted.

The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCuller

The author was 23-years-old when she wrote this brilliant novel about a deaf man’s encounters in a mill town in the US state of Georgia. You will recognise the wasted hope with just a bit of effort. Maybe less effort than you need to put into the great short stories of Mahasweta Devi, because she often wrote about aborigines and the Indian middle class dreams only of America.

425,2020/10/19,"Friendship and strength: Review of Charlie Mackesy’s ‘The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse’","Filled with nuggets of philosophy, heartwarming conversations and gorgeous calligraphic illustrations, Mackesy’s book is a work of art

Early in March, before the world as we knew it changed, my friends and I had a ritual of sorts. Every evening, we’d gather together and stroll to the nearby chai spot, skirting puddles and people, as the conversation flitted from one topic to another. Someone would be stressed, another worried, yet another scared. As we gathered around steaming cups of chai, grievances were poured out and wisdom shared — earnest, clichéd and a tad saccharine , but also heartwarming and kind. It was this feeling that I revisited as I thumbed through Charlie Mackesy’s The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, book excerpts, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

The book, in Mackesy’s words, is a “small graphic novel of images and conversations over a landscape.” Think the nostalgia of A.A. Milne’s Winnie-the-Pooh married to the earnestness of Michael Bond’s Paddington Bear, complete with gorgeous calligraphic illustrations. Much like Pooh, it follows the journey of the titular characters, set off by a chance meeting of the young boy and the mole. The two strike up an unlikely friendship as they wander through the wilderness, swapping pieces of insight and encouragement. Midway through their journey, the duo meet a fox caught in a snare. Despite the danger, the mole takes a leap of faith to rescue the fox, before embracing a horse as yet another member of their motley crew.

Bites of wisdom

The story is deceptively simple and fragmented, filled with nuggets of philosophy and conversations designed to make you feel warm and happy. While the clean layout and short blocks of text scream “children’s book,” some of the themes may be out of reach for the little ones. For instance, on finding two stately swans gliding peacefully across a lake, the boy asks, “How do they look so together and perfect?”

“There is a lot of frantic paddling going on beneath,” replies the horse.

Succinct quotes aside, The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse is primarily a work of art. Mackesy’s experience as a cartoonist (for Britain’s The Spectator) and book illustrator shines through the pages. The book features over 100 drawings, colour and black-and-white. Sketched with his signature thick-nibbed dip pen and ink, the curvy lines and cursive writing lend an air of intimacy, much like a letter from a long-lost friend. “The greatest illusion is that life should be perfect,” reads one illustration, smudged by tiny paw prints. Point taken, Mackesy’s dog.

The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse is a book that invites the reader’s engagement. Like the story, the physical copy too has a lot of spaces for you to interact with, jot notes, scribble, and maybe add a sketch of your own. At 128 pages, it is a quick read, though to treat it as a check mark on a reading list is bound to be disappointing. This tale of friendship and strength lives in a corner of your heart, waiting for you to summon when the going gets tough.

Specialised drones are being tested in a programme to boost koala numbers on Australia's east coast, dropping seeds of gum trees as part of a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) scheme to regenerate bushland torched in the country's historic bushfires.

Gum tree leaves are koala's main food source, and restoring bushland and forest habitat razed in the 2019-2020 fires is key to their long-term survival in New South Wales state.

The fires killed or displaced 3 billion mammals, birds and reptiles, the WWF estimates, and destroyed or damaged up to 7 billion trees across 37 million acres of Australia's southeast, equal to half the area of the United Kingdom.

WWF's Australia unit is seeking to raise A$300 million ($210 million) over five years to fund the initiative to try the seed drones and other methods to revive forest habitat, aiming to double koala numbers on the east coast.

“The magnitude of the bushfire crisis requires us to respond at a scale that's never been done before,” said WWF-Australia CEO Dermot OGorman. “One of the new ways we're doing this is using drones that can put large amounts of seed across landscapes and ... reach inaccessible areas much easier.”

Some of the WWF drones can plant 40,000 seeds a day and will help create corridors so that koalas and other wildlife can move across a landscape fragmented by fire and land clearing, OGorman said in a statement.

In June, a parliamentary inquiry found that koalas in New South Wales state could become extinct by 2050 unless immediate action is taken to protect them and their habitat.

Australia's most recent bushfire season was one of its worst ever, killing 34 people and destroying nearly 3,000 homes, after years of drought left bushlands unusually dry.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/l1wf4b/article32891662.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIAKOALAHABITAT,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/wwf-australia-drones-to-drop-seeds-for-koala-gum-trees/article32891664.ece
427,2020/10/19,"Celebrating skinks, Zoological Survey of India lists 62 species","The harmless, insectivorous lizards are found across the country in every bio-geographic zone

With long bodies, relatively small or no legs, no pronounced neck and glossy scales, skinks are common reptiles around homes, garages, and open spaces such as sparks and school playgrounds, and around lakes. Although they are common reptiles and have a prominent role in maintaining ecosystems, not much is known about their breeding habits, and ecology because identification of the species can be confusing.

A recent publication by the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) reveals that India is home to 62 species of skinks and says about 57% of all the skinks found in India (33 species) are endemic.

The publication, Skinks of India, was released earlier this month by Union Minister of State, Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change Babul Supriyo.

“It is the first monograph on this group of lizards, which are found in all kinds of habitats in the country, from the Himalayas to the coasts and from dense forests to the deserts,” Kaushik Deuti, scientist of ZSI and one of the authors of the publication, said.

Director ZSI Kailash Chandra, said while a lot of work is done on other groups of reptiles like snakes or geckos, skinks are an ignored species.

Skinks are highly alert, agile and fast moving and actively forage for a variety of insects and small invertebrates. The reduced limbs of certain skink species or the complete lack of them make their slithering movements resemble those of snakes, leading people to have incorrect notion that they are venomous. This results in several of these harmless creatures being killed.

Wide collaboration

“The publication is a result of four years of work and study of over 4,000 specimens in all 16 regional centres of ZSI and also at the Bombay Natural History Society, Indian Institute of Science, Wildlife Institute of India, and the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology & Natural History. It also makes an attempt to ‘redescribe’ all the 62 species with their taxonomic identification keys, distributional maps, habits, habitat and breeding biology,” Dr. Chandra said.

The book also gives a phylogenetic and bio-geographical analysis of distribution of these species in all the 11 bio-geographic zones of India and a detailed account on the historical studies on this group of lizards from the British era to the present.

The Western Ghats are home to 24 species of which 18 are endemic to the region. The Deccan Peninsular region is home to 19 species of which 13 are endemic. There are records of 14 skink species from the northeast of which two species are endemic.

Dr Deuti, however, pointed out that with 1,602 species of skinks across the world, making it the largest family of lizards, their occurrence in India is less than 4 % of the global diversity.

Of the 16 genera of skinks found in India, four genera are endemic. Sepsophis (with one species)and Barkudia (with two species) are limbless skinks found in the hills and coastal plains of the eastern coast. Barkudia insularisis believed to be found only in the Barkud Island in Chilka lake in Odisha. Barkudia melanosticta is endemic to Visakhapatnam. Sepsophis punctatus is endemic to the northern part of Eastern Ghats. Five species of Kaestlea (blue-tailed ground skinks) are endemic to the Western Ghats and four species of Ristella (Cat skinks) also endemic to the southern part of Western Ghats.

Other authors of the publication, Achyuthan Srikanthan from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, and three other ZSI researchers — Sujoy Raha, Probhat Bag and Sudipta Debnath — said that alongside its taxonomic significance, the book will generate interest among nature enthusiasts and lay people about skinks.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/5jb01/article32887201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/skinks,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/celebrating-skinks-zsi-lists-62-species-in-india/article32886528.ece
428,2020/10/19,Coronavirus | Need to continue extreme caution against COVID-19: WHO,"Co-circulation of seasonal influenza and COVID-19 in winters may present challenges for health systems and facilities, as both diseases present many similar symptoms.

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday cautioned against any relaxation of response actions following the recent slight decline in COVID-19 cases in South-East Asia Region, saying the pandemic continues unabated and “our response only needs to be strengthened further to curtail virus transmission”.

Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director WHO South-East Asia Region, said, “There should be no complacency in view of the declining numbers in recent weeks. The Region still reports large numbers of COVID-19 cases. We need to continue to do our very best to curtail the pandemic”.

Caution in festival season

She said the upcoming festival season and the approaching winter/cold season threatened to aggravate the situation “if we let our guards down”.

“This festive season we must continue to take responsibility as individuals need to maintain physical distance, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and wear a mask when and where needed. People must remember the three Cs - avoid crowded places, avoid closed settings and avoid confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation,’’ she observed.

In its release, the group said the co-circulation of seasonal influenza and COVID-19 in the winters may present challenges for health systems and health facilities, since both diseases present many similar symptoms. “Many of the same measures that are effective in preventing COVID-19 are also effective for preventing influenza, including physical distancing, hand hygiene, covering coughs, ventilation and masks’’.

Positivity rate

India’s national cumulative COVID-19 positivity rate has fallen under 8% and this trend has been sustained without a break for four days. “The positivity rate now stood at 7.94%,’’a release issued by the Union Health Ministry on Monday said.

The total tests have crossed 9.5 crore and the average daily positivity rate is 6.13% for October third week. India's active caseload stood at 7,72,055 on Monday and presently the active cases comprised 10.23% of the total positive cases of the country. The total recovered cases were more than 66 lakh. Patients, numbering 66,399, have recovered and discharged in the last 24 hours, said the Ministry.

Seventy-nine per cent of the new recovered cases were observed to be concentrated in 10 States/UTs viz., Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Maharashtra alone had contributed the maximum, with more than 11,000 single day recovery, followed by Kerala and Karnataka, with more than 8,000 recoveries each.

The country has reported 579 case fatalities in the past 24 hours. “After 90 days, the daily deaths recorded are below 600. Of these, nearly 83% are concentrated in ten State/UTs. More than 25% of new fatalities reported are from Maharashtra (150),’’ said the Ministry.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/azjmbn/article32895124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POONAMKHETRAPALSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/need-to-continue-extreme-caution-against-covid-19-who/article32895125.ece
429,2020/10/19,Meet the people who quit their addictions during the pandemic,"Despite news of alcohol flying off the shelves after the lockdown, many used the past six months to pause, and set themselves free from their addictions

“Every time someone compliments me on my health, I break into a big smile. Not because I crave validation but because these are the results of putting my past behind me. It was a past defined by alcoholism and the time I had spent regretting, but not acting on it,” says Robin*, a 27-year-old corporate employee.

Support and courage

Two years ago, Robin moved to Bengaluru from Dharwad for a new job. “Initially it was great but in a few months the work environment started turning toxic and I was stressed all the time. This led to a fallout with my long-term partner. Rather than handling it in a healthy way and working on my mental health, I turned to alcohol just to numb the pain. In a few months’ time I had gone from an occasional drinker to an alcoholic,” he says.

Here are a few apps that you can turn to if you are planning to quit your addictions Smoke Free: Based on the data you enter it provides you the health and financial benefits you’ll enjoy if you resist a cigarette. On Android and iOS

Sobriety counter: With a colourful interface this app has a health tracker that gives details about your cell regeneration, withdrawal symptoms, blood alcohol levels, when you’re in the process of quitting alcohol. It also has a game to distract until the urge to drink passes, and a tab that shows your savings by giving up drinking. There are badges for every time you say no. On Android

I Am Sober: The app helps you choose from options that include alcohol, marijuana, smoking, and drugs. It keeps a track of the number of days, minutes, and seconds spent sober and the money saved. It also connects you to a wide network of people in the recovery stage and those who have recovered. On Android and iOS

This continued for over one and a half years. Then the lockdown was announced. “I was at my parents’ place when the restrictions were imposed. Both of them are teetotallers so there was no alcohol at home. With my previous experiences, I couldn’t go more than a week without drinking. I did manage to sneak in a whisky bottle which I downed in two days but after that there was no way to procure alcohol. I struggled to get a grip over myself as the withdrawal symptoms started showing,” he adds.

Robin recalls those weeks of nausea, fever and heavy sweating. “My parents, initially, did not understand what was happening to me, but they helped me deal with it and that was my wake up call. I knew I had to give up drinking so I started reading a lot about it online and learnt about withdrawal symptoms and how to deal with them,” he says. He has been sober for over three months now.

Locking up temptations

Several people used the lockdown to tackle their dependence on alcohol or drugs. “Having friends and family who are supportive is extremely important when one tries to get over addictions. After the lockdown, I have noticed a positive trend where parents are willing to come forward and help their kids rather than judging and humiliating them,” says Leonora R Mohan, consultant psychologist who runs Sparsh Counselling Centre in Visakhapatnam.

Leonora says that her clinic saw a 25% increase in the number of people who sought help for de-addiction. Most are young adults and teenagers for weed addiction. “Lockdown gave people the time and space to rethink their decisions. It also crippled easy access to the addictive substance,” she says, adding that being away from a group or situation that may have earlier supported the addiction, also helped.

The lockdown was a busy time for the staff of Green Valley Foundation, a de-addiction centre in Visakhapatnam. Earlier, they would get one or two calls for help in a week. “During the lockdown we had six to 10 calls every day from families. Our team turned to online counselling,” says Uma Raj, caretaker at Green Valley Foundation. The staff guided families through the deaddiction process and counselled members about talking to loved ones. They also chalked out diets and exercises to help the person regain health.

Uma believes that the true test for people who curtailed their dependency on drugs and alcohol during lockdown would be now, when we have easy access to everything. “I would advise people to seek professional help, as counsellors are trained to identify behavioural patterns, and avoid the chances of a relapse,” she says.

Amrita*, 29, who quit smoking during the lockdown agrees that a relapse can happen any time. “I went 61 days without a cigarette and then after a tough day at work, I decided to light just one. Over the next few days, I smoked an entire pack. The relapse hurt a lot. I felt terrible, like a failure.” But she has now gone without one for 85 days.

What worked for Amrita was setting smaller goals and support from her partner and her friends. “I announced it on social media. Once you put something out on social media and get some validation, it’s helpful,” she says, of turning a negative of online platforms, into a positive.

430,2020/10/19,Touch-and-go: NASA's Osiris-Rex set to collect samples from asteroid Bennu,"If the first attempt doesn’t work, Osiris-Rex can try again. Any collected samples won’t reach Earth until 2023.

After almost two years circling an ancient asteroid hundreds of millions of miles away, a NASA spacecraft this week will attempt to descend to the treacherous, boulder-packed surface and snatch a handful of rubble.

The drama unfolds Tuesday as the U.S. takes its first crack at collecting asteroid samples for return to Earth, a feat accomplished so far only by Japan.

Brimming with names inspired by Egyptian mythology, the Osiris-Rex mission is looking to bring back at least 60 grams worth of asteroid Bennu, the biggest otherworldly haul from beyond the moon.

The van-sized spacecraft is aiming for the relatively flat middle of a tennis court-sized crater named Nightingale - a spot comparable to a few parking places here on Earth. Boulders as big as buildings loom over the targeted touchdown zone.

What’s everyone up to this weekend? I’m getting ready for my boop with Bennu!

“So for some perspective, the next time you park your car in front of your house or in front of a coffee shop and walk inside, think about the challenge of navigating Osiris-Rex into one of these spots from 200 million miles away,” said NASA’s deputy project manager Mike Moreau.

Once it drops out of its 0.75 kilometer-high orbit around Bennu, the spacecraft will take a deliberate four hours to make it all the way down, to just above the surface.

Then the action cranks up when Osiris-Rex’s 3.4-meter arm reaches out and touches Bennu. Contact should last five to 10 seconds, just long enough to shoot out pressurized nitrogen gas and suck up the churned dirt and gravel. Programmed in advance, the spacecraft will operate autonomously during the unprecedented touch-and-go maneuver.

With an 18-minute lag in radio communication each way, ground controllers for spacecraft builder Lockheed Martin near Denver can’t intervene.

If the first attempt doesn’t work, Osiris-Rex can try again. Any collected samples won’t reach Earth until 2023.

While NASA has brought back comet dust and solar wind particles, it’s never attempted to sample one of the nearly 1 million known asteroids lurking in our solar system until now. Japan, meanwhile, expects to get samples from asteroid Ryugu in December — in the milligrams at most — 10 years after bringing back specks from asteroid Itokawa.

Bennu is an asteroid picker’s paradise. The big, black, roundish, carbon-rich space rock — taller than New York’s Empire State Building — was around when our solar system was forming 4.5 billion years ago. Scientists consider it a time capsule full of pristine building blocks that could help explain how life formed on Earth and possibly elsewhere.

“This is all about understanding our origins,” said the mission’s principal scientist, Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona.

When Osiris-Rex blasted off in 2016 on the more than $800 million mission, scientists envisioned sandy stretches at Bennu. So the spacecraft was designed to ingest small pebbles less than an inch (2 centimeters) across.

Scientists were stunned to find massive rocks and chunky gravel all over the place when the spacecraft arrived in 2018. And pebbles were occasionally seen shooting off the asteroid, falling back and sometimes ricocheting off again in a cosmic game of ping-pong.

With so much rough terrain, engineers scrambled to aim for a tighter spot than originally anticipated. Nightingale Crater, the prime target, appears to have the biggest abundance of fine grains, but boulders still abound, including one dubbed Mount Doom. Then COVID-19 struck.

The team fell behind and bumped the second and final touch-and-go dress rehearsal for the spacecraft to August. That pushed the sample grab to October.

“Returning a sample is hard,” said NASA’s science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen. “The COVID made it even harder.”

Osiris-Rex has three bottles of nitrogen gas, which means it can touch down three times - no more.

The spacecraft automatically will back away if it encounters unexpected hazards like big rocks that could cause it to tip over. And there’s a chance it will touch down safely, but fail to collect enough rubble.

In either case, the spacecraft would return to orbit around Bennu and try again in January at another location.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/fq0kiy/article32891264.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bennu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/touch-and-go-nasas-osiris-rex-set-to-collect-samples-from-asteroid-bennu/article32891265.ece
431,2020/10/19,"Antibodies fade quickly in recovering COVID-19 patients, study finds","Understanding how the levels of antibodies change over time is critical not only for optimising the use of convalescent plasma but also for understanding vaccine efficacy.

Antibody levels in the blood of COVID-19 patients drop rapidly during the weeks after their bodies have cleared the novel coronavirus, and symptoms have subsided, according to a study.

In the absence of approved, effective treatments for COVID-19, some hospitals have been treating patients with severe symptoms with blood plasma from recovering patients.

If convalescent plasma is ultimately shown to have a clear benefit, the new study published in the journal mBio concluded that it needs to be collected during a specific window of time after recovery.

However, recovering patients can’t donate blood until at least 14 days after symptoms have subsided, to give the body time to clear viral particles.

“We don’t want to transfuse the virus, just transfuse the antibodies,” said Andres Finzi at the University of Montreal in Canada. “But at the same time, our work shows that the capacity of the plasma to neutralise viral particles is going down during those first weeks.”

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 plays a crucial role in helping the virus grab and invade host cells. Antibodies produced by the body’s immune system bind to a part of this protein and block the capacity of this “key” to engage with the host’s cellular “lock”, preventing the viral particle from infecting a cell host, said Finzi.

Previous studies suggest that antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein peak 2 or 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Findings from an earlier cross-sectional study by Finzi’s group, involving more than 100 patients, suggested that the ability of plasma to neutralise the virus decreased significantly between 3 and 6 weeks after symptom onset.

In the new longitudinal study, Finzi and his colleagues analysed blood samples collected at one-month intervals from 31 individuals recovering from COVID-19.

They measured levels of immunoglobulins that act against the coronavirus S protein and tested the ability of the antibodies to neutralise the virus. The researchers observed variation on the level of individual patients but identified a consistent overall signal.

The levels of immunoglobulins G, A, and M that target the binding site decreased between 6 and 10 weeks after symptoms began, they found. During the same time period, the ability of the antibodies to neutralise the virus similarly fell, according to the researchers.

Understanding how the levels of antibodies change over time is critical not only for optimising the use of convalescent plasma but also for understanding vaccine efficacy and whether or not previously infected people are at risk of re-infection, they added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/gzlc33/article32890493.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKINDONESIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/antibodies-fade-quickly-in-recovering-covid-19-patients-study-finds/article32890494.ece
