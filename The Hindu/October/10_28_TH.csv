0,2020/10/28,Para-badminton World champion feted by Time magazine,"Eight years ago, she was a 23-year-old software engineer riding her scooter to work in Mumbai when a truck smashed into her, crushing her left leg and breaking both arms.

Manasi Joshi lost her leg in a horrific road accident, but found her calling — and international recognition — on the badminton court.

Now the inspirational World champion, who has featured on the cover of Time magazine and has had a Barbie doll created in her image, is targeting Paralympic gold when the sport debuts in Tokyo next year.

Eight years ago, she was a 23-year-old software engineer riding her scooter to work in Mumbai when a truck smashed into her, crushing her left leg and breaking both arms.

Joshi’s severely injured leg was amputated by doctors and she faced months of rehabilitation to learn to walk again.

But the accident could not damage her spirit and the young woman was determined to build her strength by playing her favourite sport, badminton.

Learning experience

“It has been a journey about learning and accepting different things,” said Joshi from Ahmedabad.

“Working hard on things that looked hard but are a new normal now. So I have come a long way.”

Five months after putting on the artificial limb, Joshi won her first gold in an office tournament against able-bodied players.

“I used more of my mind. Made people run, made sure that wherever I put the shuttle they end up giving it to my hand so that I could finish the point,” she said.

“It was a turning point after my injury and the win certainly boosted my confidence.”

Emboldened, she trained harder with the support of her family and eventually quit software engineering to play badminton full-time in 2016. Two years later, she joined P. Gopi Chand’s academy in Hyderabad, and became a member of India’s National para-badminton squad.

Last year, Joshi won singles gold at the para-badminton World Championships.

Time featured Joshi on the cover of their Asia edition this month as one of eight global “next generation” leaders.

The makers of America’s famous Barbie doll celebrated the achievements of Joshi on the International Day of Girl Child on October 11 with a Barbie modelled on her.

Inspirational

“I feel honoured to be a part of all this.

“And I think this will inspire people and they will believe that everything is possible,” Joshi said, adding that there was growing acknowledgement of the achievements of differently-abled athletes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/efe7uz/article32965741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29MANSI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/manasi-triumphing-over-adversity/article32965742.ece
1,2020/10/28,Delighted to have the ball rolling again: Sharath,"All set for 42-day National TT camp

After a seven-month layoff forced by the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the country’s leading table tennis players arrived at Sonepat on Wednesday for a 42-day National camp aimed at the Olympic qualification next year.

Nine-time National champion Sharath Kamal, and Anusha Kutumbale, both part of the 11-player group, will reach on Thursday.

All the campers were required to clear a COVID-19 test three days prior to their travel to Sonepat. After six days of mandatory quarantine, the players will start training.

Sharath, instrumental in pushing for this camp since August in keeping with Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI)’s plan and the requirements laid down by the Sports Authority of India (SAI), was “delighted to have the ball rolling again”.

“I am looking forward to getting back the focus and concentration which is not possible to experience when you are training at home. There will be some young, quality players in the camp, like Manav Thakkar and Sudhanshu Grover, and we all can gain from each other’s presence,” Sharath told The Hindu on Wedesday.

From those missing from the camp, G. Sathiyan is training in Germany and currently playing in France. On his return, Sathiyan is due to play in Japan.

Harmeet Desai is training in Poland while A. Amalraj is recovering from COVID-19.

Satisfied

Manika Batra and Madhurika Patkar have expressed satisfaction with their training routine in Pune and Thane, respectively.

In contrast to the initial apprehension expressed by several players, the news of Sharath’s presence at Sonepat has prompted many of them to enquire about joining the camp later.

The TTFI is not in favour of such staggered arrivals of the players that could raise the risk of COVID-19 for the campers. The camp ends on December 9.

TTFI secretary M.P. Singh said “the camp will help them come into good shape, kind of match-ready fitness, before the Olympic qualifiers next year.”

The campers: Men: A. Sharath Kamal, Manav Thakkar, Manush Shah, Sudhanshu Grover and Jubin Kumar. Women: Sutirtha Mukherjee, Archana Kamath, Anusha Kutumbale, Takeme Sarkar, Kaushani Nath and Diya Chitale. Coaches: Arup Basak, Sunil Babras and Sachin Shetty.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/6tcx7k/article32965718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29KAMAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/delighted-to-have-the-ball-rolling-again-sharath/article32965720.ece
2,2020/10/28,NADA’s panel exonerates junior judoka,"The National Anti-Doping Agency’s Disciplinary Panel (ADDP) has exonerated junior judoka Jitesh Dagar of the charge that he evaded a dope test during a selection trial last year after NADA’s Dope Control Officer failed to produce any clinching evidence against him.

The event in question was the open selection trial for the Asia Oceanic and Junior Judo Championship held in Bhopal on June 13, 2019.

Dagar was provisionally suspended on charges that he left the venue without providing his urine sample for mandatory dope testing after finishing third in the +100 kg category following a semi-final loss.

However, NADA’s ADDP comprising chairman Sunny Choudhary, Col (Dr) RK Chengappa and Kuldeep Handoo ruled that there is no conclusive evidence that the Dope Control Officers in question had informed the judoka that he needs to provide his sample.

“The DCO’s report failed to satisfy the panel that they had approached the athlete after the event and that the athlete evaded after being approached,” Dagar’s lawyer Parth Goswami told PTI on Wednesday.

“Athlete was never approached or notified for the test and therefore there was no question of evading the dope test,” he said in his client’s defence.

NADA had charged the athlete under ADRV (Anti Doping Rules Violations) clause 2.3 which can lead up to four years of suspension for evading dope tests.

However, the panel, in its conclusion report, pointed that NADA’s DCO was “casual” in his approach and asked the anti-doping body to keep official documentation of the date and timing of intimation to athletes.

“In the facts and circumstances of this case, where it is clear and not proved from the report of the DCO or any other evidence that any announcement was made that the athletes who have alleged to have secured particular positions in their weight category will have to submit themselves for dope testing,” the panel observed.

The report categorically stated, “NADA has failed to prove that violations under clause 2.3 of Anti-Doping Rules has taken place. .... the athlete is exonerated from charges levelled against him for intentionally evading submitting the urine sample for testing.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/nadas-panel-exonerates-junior-judoka/article32962315.ece

4,2020/10/28,Djokovic wins Vienna opener to close on Sampras record,"Djokovic beat compatriot Krajinovic 7-6 (8/6), 6-3 and needs to win his next match in Austria against Borna Coric to ensure he equals the achievement of his childhood idol.

Novak Djokovic defeated Filip Krajinovic in the first round in Vienna on Tuesday to edge closer to Pete Sampras's all-time record of ending the year as world number one on six occasions.

Djokovic beat compatriot Krajinovic 7-6 (8/6), 6-3 and needs to win his next match in Austria against Borna Coric to ensure he equals the achievement of his childhood idol.

The 33-year-old Serb has been the top-ranked player at the end of a season five times: in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2018.

He shares that mark with career rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

Sampras achieved the feat six years in succession between 1993 and 1998.

Djokovic was playing in Vienna for the first time since he won the title there in 2007, and dropped serve twice in a tricky opening set.

Krajinovic served for the first set at 5-4 and then held a set point in the tie-break but couldn't take advantage.

A couple of breaks in the second set allowed Djokovic to clinch victory -- his 38th in 40 matches this year.

“First set, I think he was the better player. He was serving for the first set and I was lucky. He missed a smash at 6/6 in the tie-break,” said Djokovic.

“A few points here and there can change the momentum of the match. In the second set, I stepped it up, I played better and I am just pleased with the way I finished the match.”

The 17-time Grand Slam title winner is appearing at his first tournament since his heavy loss to Nadal in the Roland Garros final two weeks ago.

Djokovic is also attempting to beat Federer's all-time best of 310 weeks spent on top of the rankings.

On Monday, Djokovic began his 292nd week in total as world number one.

Djokovic and US Open winner Dominic Thiem are two of six top 10 players in the draw in the Austrian capital.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/ikq0pu/article32958385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DJOKOVIC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/djokovic-wins-vienna-opener-to-close-on-sampras-record/article32958386.ece

6,2020/10/28,Govt gets notice after saying it has no information on Aarogya Setu creator,"The show-cause notices were issued to Central Public Information Officers of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), National Informatics Centre (NIC) and National E-Governance Division (NeGD).

The Central Information Commission (CIC) on Wednesday issued a notice to the government for providing an evasive response to an RTI application related to Aarogya Setu, the contact tracing app that has crores of users' data.

The show-cause notices were issued to Central Public Information Officers of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), National Informatics Centre (NIC) and National E-Governance Division (NeGD) after the agencies failed to give information on the process of creating the Aarogya Setu app, files relating to the creation, and audit measures to check for misuse of personal data of users.

The complaint filed by Saurav Das said that the CPIO, NeGD, and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology did not provide any information. The complaint further noted that the information was not provided by NIC and stated that it ‘does not hold the information’ relating to the app’s creation. However, it is mentioned as the app’s creator.

“The CPIO NIC also should explain that when in the website it is mentioned that Aarogya Setu Platform is designed, developed and hosted by National Informatics Centre, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India, then how is it that they do not have any information about creation of the app,” CIC said.

It added that the failure to explain anything regarding the creation of the app, and where are the files is extremely preposterous.

The commission has directed the CPIOs of the agencies to appear before the bench on November 24.

8,2020/10/28,Large tech firms urge EU for protection to tackle illegal content online,"Edima, the association that represents the firms, said stronger protection would allow companies to take proactive actions to remove illegal content and activity from their services.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Google, Microsoft and others have urged the European Union to introduce legal safeguards to help them tackle illegal content online.

Edima, the association that represents the firms, said stronger protection would allow companies to take proactive actions to remove illegal content and activity from their services, without the risk of additional liability for those attempts to tackle illegal content.

It added that such safeguards will ensure better quality content moderation by companies of content generated by users.

“The EU approach to the freedom of expression is different to that of the US so our approach to moderating content online must be different also. Our proposal is based on European values and laws and sets clear limits to the legal safeguard for service providers in order to protect the freedom of expression and to prevent overaction by service providers,” El Ramly, EDiMA’s Director General, said.

Under existing rules, online service providers are obliged to remove illegal content when they have ‘actual knowledge’ of its presence. This ensures that companies are not obliged to police all content uploaded by users, which would inevitably infringe on the fundamental rights to speech and privacy.

However, if a service provider is deemed to have ‘actual knowledge’ of illegal activity/content on their service that they fail to remove, they cannot benefit from the limited liability provisions of the e-Commerce Directive.

If a service provider has put in place an algorithm to detect infringements, it is not entirely clear if these measures confer ‘actual knowledge’ on the service provider.

In the US, protection has been provided through Good Samaritan Principle, under Section 230(c) of the Communications Decency Act. It states that actions taken by a service provider to reduce illegal activity online do not impact on the limited liability of the service provider.

However, it gives online service providers greater control on removing not only illegal content but also “not-illegal-but-harmful” content. The principle has received criticism as it is framed in manner of freedom of speech to service providers than as a tool to protect them from liability for illegal content.

“This has raised concerns that the US Good Samaritan Principle potentially creates a difficult hurdle to overcome when someone wishes to question a service provider’s moderation decision on content that is not illegal. For these reasons and others, Europe needs to take a different approach,” Edima said.

In a paper published as part of its Online Responsibility Framework Series, the association recommends new measures for service providers including minimum information levels in notices of illegal content and the requirement of a human review of appeals of removal of content. It also acknowledges the need for an appropriate governance structure to manage these provisions and called this to be a part of Digital Services Act.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/7cto35/article32962596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/big-tech-eujpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/large-tech-firms-urge-eu-for-protection-to-tackle-illegal-content-online/article32962570.ece

Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed their second instalment of autonomous boat. The new Roboat II can ferry passengers.

It weighs over 50 kg and is two metres long, a metre longer than its predecessor, and can carry two passengers.

“Roboat II navigates autonomously using algorithms similar to those used by self-driving cars, but now adapted for water,” MIT Professor Daniela Rus said in a release.

The MIT team worked with Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions to create navigation and control algorithms to update the communication and collaboration among the boats. They are working on building the world's first fleet of autonomous boats for the City of Amsterdam, a MIT noted.

“We’re developing fleets of Roboats that can deliver people and goods, and connect with other Roboats to form a range of autonomous platforms to enable water activities,” Rus added.

After picking up a passenger, Roboat II uses its algorithm and data from sensors including GPS to track its location and speed, and plots a path based on current traffic conditions to the passenger’s destination. The system’s automatic controller also updates the path to avoid obstacles.

11,2020/10/28,Mercedes bets on evolution as Tesla touts revolution in automated driving,"Advanced driver assistance systems can provide steering, braking and acceleration support under limited circumstances, generally on highways. Carmakers have refrained from relying on their technology to let cars navigate urban inner-city traffic.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

As Tesla touts the cutting-edge nature of its new Full Self Driving software, rival Mercedes-Benz says it has developed a similar system but stops short of allowing members of the public to take it on urban roads. The Germans, pioneers in developing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), are taking a step-by-step approach to releasing new technology, waiting for their own engineers, rather than the general public, to validate their system.

Both approaches — one conservative and one radical in nature — are designed to push highly automated driving on to public roads, a step that could massively reduce accidents, since computers have faster accident-avoidance reflexes than humans.

Advanced driver assistance systems can provide steering, braking and acceleration support under limited circumstances, generally on highways. Carmakers have refrained from relying on their technology to let cars navigate urban inner-city traffic. Tesla broke this tradition last week when it released its FSD software which allows its computer-powered cars to practise their reflexes in inner-city traffic situations, with a warning that its cars “May Do the Wrong Thing at the Worst Time.”

Mercedes does not allow members of the public to test still-experimental systems. Its engineers need to pass an eligibility exam to become test drivers, and another one for testing automated driving systems, the carmaker said.

Rather than force their customers to put their trust in processors, software and the ability of machines to learn over time, the Germans want their cars to be validated by engineers so that they remain predictable for owners.

“We do not want blind trust. We want informed trust in the car. The customer needs to know exactly what the car can and cannot do,” a Mercedes spokesman told Reuters on the sidelines of the carmaker's test track in Immendingen, Germany.

“The worst thing would be if the car gets into a complex situation and there was ambiguity over whether the car is in control or not,” he said.

This is why the Stuttgart-based carmaker, owned by Daimler AG, is emphasising its decades-old experience of automated driver assistance systems as it seeks to gain global regulatory approval for its own Drive Pilot system which boasts level 3 automation.

Level 3 means the driver can legally take their eyes off the wheel and the company, Daimler in this case, would have to assume insurance liability, depending on the jurisdiction.

The new Tesla system forces customers to take responsibility for any crash.

'LOGICAL NEXT STEP'

Mercedes-Benz started using camera-based systems in 2009, offering traffic-light recognition and lane-keeping assistance systems, switching to stereo cameras in 2013, to add depth of field and pedestrian recognition for emergency braking functions.

It was on a joint development project between the Tesla Model S and the Mercedes-Benz electric B-Class that Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, learned about camera and radar-based assistance systems, senior engineers familiar with the project told Reuters.

Mercedes plans to launch Drive Pilot next year and is pitching it as an evolution of its Distronic system, launched in 2013, which uses cameras and radar to keep cars in lane and at a distance to the car in front.

Drive Pilot will add a new sensor: Lidar, to cross-reference data gathered by radar, ultrasonic sensors, high-definition mapping, radar and cameras.

“It is a paradigm change from Distronic, but it is a strategic evolution. For us this is the logical next step and it is not shooting for the moon,” said Michael Decker, manager of automated driving at Mercedes-Benz Cars, while standing on the sidelines of the company's testing campus in Immendingen, where the Mercedes hones autonomous driving systems.

Decker, behind the wheel of the new S-Class, drives the car on to a stretch of road mocked up to replicate an autobahn and selects Drive Pilot. The car glides seamlessly, providing gentle braking and steering inputs to keep its place in moving traffic.

“I spend most of my time dealing with edge cases, those special situations that we need to have under control,” he said. The Mercedes Drive Pilot will only work at up to 60 kilometers an hour, and reach higher speeds once the legal framework allows.

It will function only on highways in Germany from mid-next year onward, if a new law is passed.

“If the car crosses the border into France, it will disengage, because we use high-definition mapping as one of our validation systems, and France has not created the legal framework for allowing this system to operate,” Decker said.

Although Mercedes engineers are aware of Tesla's more aggressive approach to marketing their systems, they appear unruffled.

“Yes. We always followed this path. And we now see that we have the right strategy,” Decker said.

“What is paramount here is safety. This is about having a mature system. Mercedes safety standards stand over and above everything, including speed.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/qsfa95/article32960639.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mercedes,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/mercedes-bets-on-evolution-as-tesla-touts-revolution-in-automated-driving/article32960760.ece
12,2020/10/28,"Waymo, Daimler to partner in developing self-driving semi trucks","The partnership accelerates a race to put automated heavy-duty trucks on the road, with a handful of powerful teams chasing commercial customers seeking to reduce dependence on human drivers.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Daimler AG's commercial truck unit and Alphabet Inc's Waymo on Tuesday said they will collaborate on development of self-driving Class 8 semi trucks, applying Waymo's automated system to Daimler's Freightliner Cascadia.

Class 8 trucks are semi trucks and other large commercial vehicles with a carrying capacity exceeding 33,000 lb (14969 kg).

The partnership accelerates a race to put automated heavy-duty trucks on the road, with a handful of powerful teams chasing commercial customers seeking to reduce dependence on human drivers.

Waymo Chief Executive John Krafcik said during a conference call that it will take time for major suppliers of Class 8 truck hardware to develop the braking, steering and other technology required to bring a fully automated semi to market in high volume.

“These are super-long timelines,” he said.

The agreement is another win for Waymo as it tries to bring aboard more established vehicle makers. Waymo has also worked with U.S. truck maker PACCAR Inc, whose brands include Peterbilt and Kenworth, but said it does not have a formal development agreement with the Bellevue, Washington company.

Daimler Trucks North America, whose brands include Freightliner and Western Star, and rival PACCAR together control more than 70 percent of the U.S. Class 8 heavy truck sector, according to John Stark, editor of Stark's Truck & Off-Highway Ledger.

Martin Daum, head of Daimler Trucks, said the agreement with Waymo does not change the German company's previously announced plan to spend 500 million euros on automated truck development. Daum and Roger Nielsen, head of Daimler Trucks North America, said Daimler's in-house efforts to develop a robotic truck driver will continue.

“Having a dual strategy approach, working with Waymo and another company, gives our customers a choice,” Nielsen said.

Waymo has been working on self-driving vehicles for more than a decade, going back to when it was part of Alphabet's Google unit. The group initially focused on robo-taxis but in 2017 set up Waymo Via to build a goods delivery service using automated commercial vehicles, including heavy trucks.

Daimler and PACCAR will square off against Tesla, which has said it plans to begin building its automated electric Semi truck next year at a new plant in Austin, Texas.

Other heavy truck makers planning to put automated vehicles into commercial service include Volkswagen AG's Traton, which is working with Pittsburgh-based Argo, and is negotiating the acquisition of Illinois-based Navistar International Corp.

Swedish truck maker Volvo AB is collaborating with Silicon Valley chip maker Nvidia Corp in its autonomous truck efforts.

15,2020/10/28,China slams U.S. Senators for ‘genocide’ resolution,"They are telling all kinds of lies: Beijing

China on Wednesday accused U.S. Senators of telling “all kind of lies” after a group of lawmakers put forward a resolution accusing Beijing of genocide against Muslim minority groups in the far northwestern region of Xinjiang.

Relations between Washington and Beijing are at their worst in years over a series of flashpoints including trade, technology and human rights.

The text put forward by the Senators from across Washington’s political divide alleged China was guilty of a campaign “against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and members of other Muslim minority groups” that “constitutes genocide”.

Further fuelling the criticism, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Indian news site The Print on Tuesday that China’s actions in Xinjiang “remind us of what happened in the 1930s in Germany”.

Beijing angrily hit back on Wednesday, saying the “so-called genocide in Xinjiang is a rumour deliberately concocted by some anti-China forces”.

The sensitive region is tightly controlled by Chinese authorities, and rights groups say more than one million Uighurs have been detained in camps.

“The U.S. Senators you mentioned have always been anti-China and are keen to concoct all kinds of lies to discredit China and use them to seek their own political gains,” Foreign Spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters.

Mr. Wang also turned the tables on China’s critics, attacking the U.S. for the “assimilation and massacres of Native Americans in history to greatly reduce their population.”

“We urge certain US politicians to respect the facts, stop fabricating lies, and stop using Xinjiang-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fn2x2g/article32966579.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THRDWENG1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-slams-us-senators-for-genocide-resolution/article32966580.ece

17,2020/10/28,"Suu Kyi, old guard frustrate young Myanmar politicians","They have been accused of censorship

Once celebrated as democracy champions, a tight elite of elderly former political prisoners at the helm of Myanmar’s ruling party now stand accused of oppression, discrimination and censorship.

The National League for Democracy (NLD) is widely expected to win next week’s election —five years after it swept to power in a landslide victory.

Throngs of young people signed up to the party when the Southeast Asian nation emerged from outright military rule, eager to play their role in cementing democracy.

But critics now say the top echelons of the NLD remain closed to anyone who did not serve time behind bars in the fight against the former junta — effectively sidelining the youth.

“We thought, proudly, we’d be future political leaders,” current NLD MP and former youth leader Aung Hlaing Win, now 37, told AFP. “But, unfortunately, it went the wrong way.”

The average age for the 12 members of the NLD’s top decision-making body, including party boss and civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, is more than 70. All of them were jailed or placed under house arrest for opposing the military regime.

Younger members of the party were largely reduced to supporting acts for their seniors, required to ask permission to speak to anyone outside the party and submit speeches for “censorship”, said Aung Hlaing Win.

‘No different’

“It turned out to be an oppressive system — no different from the system of military rule,” he added. “Just because they’d been political prisoners didn’t mean they knew how to run a country.” The hopes for change were dashed for many young democracy activists, who accuse the NLD of operating no better than other parties.

Political parties still ask new members about the role they played in the 1988 protests, complained 28-year-old Thinzar Shunlei Li, even though a majority of people in Myanmar were born in or after the 1980s. “This is not the right way to judge a person,” she said. “Our issues, concerns and struggles are different.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8nkdy1/article30280588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Suu-Kyi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/suu-kyi-old-guard-frustrate-young-myanmar-politicians/article32966474.ece

Azerbaijan said on Wednesday an Armenian missile strike on its Barda district near the Nagorno-Karabakh front line killed 19 civilians, but Yerevan denied carrying out an attack.

It would be the deadliest reported attack on civilians since new fighting over the disputed region broke out a month ago.

Azerbaijani presidential aide Hikmet Hajiyev said Armenian forces had fired Smerch missiles at Barda and the Prosecutor General’s office said 19 civilians had been killed and 60 wounded.

It earlier put the number of deaths at 14.

Armenian Defence Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan denied the claim.

“The statement of the ministry of defence of Azerbaijan that the Armed Forces of Armenia allegedly hit the town of Barda with Smerch is groundless and false,” she said on Facebook. On Tuesday, four civilians, including a toddler, were reported dead in an Armenian missile strike on a village in Barda, but Yerevan denied carrying out that attack as well.

19,2020/10/28,U.S. Presidential election | Campaign heats up in the final week,"Biden focuses on expanding his electoral map, Trump defends administration’s response to COVID-19

With Election Day less than a week away and close to 65 million Americans having already cast their ballots, the presidential candidates and their star campaigners are criss-crossing the country taking chances on how best to spend their final days in order to win on Tuesday next.

On Monday and Tuesday this week, U.S. President Donald Trump, focused on defending his gains in 2016, campaigned in the Upper Midwestern States of Michigan and Wisconsin as well as Nebraska after spending Monday intensely focused on Pennsylvania, where he made multiple stops. Mr. Trump won all four of these States in 2016 with wafer thin majorities (except for Nebraska).

First Lady Melania Trump held her first (and possibly, only) campaign rally in Chester County, Pennsylvania, which her husband narrowly won in 2016.

Democratic candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden is leading in the polls in Pennsylvania (+3.8 points), Michigan (+8.7 points) and Wisconsin (+7.6 points), according to an average of recent polls from polling aggregator Real Clear Politics.

Mr. Trump’s path to victory — 270 seats in the Electoral College — is narrow but still within reach.

Mr. Biden’s strategy this week appears to be different: what’s been described by analysts as an effort to ‘expand his electoral map’ — forcing Mr. Trump to defend States such as Florida and Georgia, which he won in 2016. Mr. Biden will travel to Iowa on Friday — a State Mr. Trump won comfortably in 2016.

‘Heal the nation’

However, it’s not just about the presidential race. In Georgia, Mr. Biden also campaigned with Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, fighting competitive Senate races. In Iowa too, Republican incumbent Jonie Ernst and her Democratic challenger Theresa Greenfield are battling it out in the country’s second most expensive Senate race as per the Des Moines Register.

Speaking in Warm Springs, Georgia, at a retreat of former U.S. President F.D. Roosevelt (“FDR”), Mr. Biden brought up the theme of “healing” the nation. “A few weeks ago, I spoke at Gettysburg about the need to unite our nation, and today I’m here at Warm Springs because I want to talk about how we’re going to heal our nation,” he said.

His speech included references to Civil Rights icon Martin Luther King, Pope Francis and the Bible.

“I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American President. I’ll work with Democrats and Republicans,” Mr. Biden said, repeating one of his core campaign messages. The former Vice-President has also dwelt at length on the need to control the pandemic before rebuilding the economy.

Mr. Biden’s star campaigner — former President Barack Obama — held a drive-in rally in Orlando on Tuesday, having already made stops in Pennsylvania last week and in Miami over the weekend. Mr. Biden lost Florida in 2016 and is currently running neck and neck with Mr. Trump, falling behind the President by an average of 0.4 percentage points in recent polls, according to Real Clear Politics. “You’ve got the chance to set two things right. You can bring a World Series championship [a baseball tournament] to the Sunshine State and you can send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House,” Mr. Obama told the audience.

While on the campaign trail, Mr. Obama has focused on contrasting Mr. Trump’s character and Mr. Biden’s, saying the former treats the presidency as a reality show. He has also taken to mocking Mr. Trump. “He’s jealous of COVID’s media coverage,” Mr. Obama said. “If he had been focused on COVID from the beginning, cases wouldn’t be reaching new record highs across the country this week.”

Mr. Obama also talked about his and Mr. Biden’s record on African American unemployment — which had taken a hit in the 2008 financial crisis. He said the only people better off under a Trump administration were those who got tax cuts — cuts, that Mr. Biden would roll back to finance clean energy jobs, Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Obama also said that the Trump administration has sought to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, but has not come up with an alternative for it: a theme Vice-Presidential candidate Kamala Harris also focused on while campaigning in Reno, Nevada, on Tuesday.

CNN reported that Mr. Obama is expected to join Mr. Biden in a battleground State this week — possibly Michigan, where Mr Biden is expected on Saturday. Mr. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 0.3 percentage points in 2016.

Mr. Trump’s messaging has been that the country is “rounding the turn” [turning the corner] on the pandemic — a hypothesis that runs counter to scientists’ expectations based on rising infection numbers and dropping temperatures. He has also linked the pandemic to an economic message — that the election is a choice between a “Trump super recovery” and a “Biden depression”.

Mr. Trump has also included a new segment to his campaign repertoire: playing clips featuring Mr. Biden and other top Democrats.

While at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, last week, Mr. Trump played a clip with Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris’s comments on regulating fracking and fossil fuels. Mr. Trump’s messaging also consists of questioning Mr. Biden’s cognitive state and suggesting that he is a hostage to the “radical left” which will lead the country to anarchy if Mr. Biden is elected. The President has also promoted his record of being tough on China and renegotiating trade agreements such as NAFTA, which was replaced by the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement.

Mr. Trump’s next stops are Arizona (where Democrats have not won in a presidential election since 1993) and then Florida.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rctxtz/article32966142.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THRDTRUMP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-election-campaign-heats-up-in-the-final-week/article32966143.ece
20,2020/10/28,Coronavirus | U.S. signs deal with Lilly for supply of potential antibody drug,"Lilly will start delivering the treatment within two months of receiving an emergency use authorization from the U.S. health regulator, the company said

The U.S. Government has awarded an initial $375 million contract to drugmaker Eli Lilly and Co to secure 300,000 doses of its potential experimental COVID-19 antibody treatment, a drug that has been touted by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Lilly will start delivering the treatment within two months of receiving an emergency use authorization from the U.S. health regulator, the company said.

The U.S. government also has the option to purchase up to an additional 650,000 vials for $812.5 million, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.

While vaccines are seen critical to ending the pandemic, governments are increasingly looking at effective treatment options to slow the spread of the disease and kick-start economic activity.

The company submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration earlier this month for emergency use authorization of the drug to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 patients.

The U.S. government has committed that patients will have no out-of-pocket costs for the medicine, although healthcare facilities may charge a fee for the product's administration, Lilly said.

The antibody therapy is similar to a drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals that was given to Trump during his bout with COVID-19.

The treatments belong to a class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies that are manufactured copies of antibodies created by the body to fight against an infection. Lilly's antibody was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from COVID-19.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1iojyg/article32963550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/x0mEGajw400x400,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-us-signs-deal-with-lilly-for-supply-of-potential-antibody-drug/article32963551.ece
21,2020/10/28,Macron announces new virus lockdown for France,"Bars, restaurants and non-essential businesses will be forced to close, but unlike during the two-month lockdown imposed last spring, students will continue to go to school, Macron said during a televised address.

French President Emmanuel Macron announced Wednesday a new lockdown aimed at halting an alarming acceleration of Covid-19 cases, to take effect from Thursday night until “at least December 1.”

Bars, restaurants and non-essential businesses will be forced to close, but unlike during the two-month lockdown imposed last spring, students will continue to go to school, Macron said during a televised address.

Factories and farms will also be allowed to operate, Macron said, and some public services will function, to limit the economic damage that would come from shutting down the country completely.

“The virus is being transmitted across France at a speed that even the most pessimistic did not predict,” he said.

“Like last spring, you will be able to leave your home only for work, for a doctor's visit, to help a relative, do essential shopping or go out shortly for air,” Macron said.

Written statements justifying being outside will be required, he said, suggesting that fines will again be issued for offenders.

“If in two weeks, we have the situation under better control, we will be able to re-evaluate things and hopefully open some businesses, in particular for the Christmas holiday,” he said.

“I hope we'll be able to celebrate Christmas and the New Year with family,” he said.

Like other European countries, France has seen a surge in coronavirus cases that could soon overwhelm the country's hospitals.

More than 3,000 intensive care beds now hold Covid-19 patients, a number that Macron said is poised to reach around 9,000 in November.

22,2020/10/28,Nationwide strike in Poland over abortion ruling,"In actions unthinkable before, women entered churches on Sunday to disrupt Masses, confronted priests with obscenities and spray-painted church buildings

People across Poland are vowing to stay off their jobs on Wednesday as part of a nationwide strike to protest a top court ruling that bans abortions in cases of congenitally damaged fetuses.

The nationwide strike comes amid a deepening standoff between angry crowds who have been taking to the streets over the ruling and Poland’s deeply conservative government, which has vowed not to back down.

The constitutional court ruling last Thursday has triggered daily mass protests across this central European nation of 38 million that are exposing deep divisions in a country long a bastion of conservative Catholicism that is now undergoing rapid social transformation.

Rage over the ruling, which would deny legal abortions to women even in cases where a child is sure to die upon birth, has been directed at the Roman Catholic church and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the ruling party leader and most powerful politician in the country.

In actions unthinkable before, women entered churches on Sunday to disrupt Masses, confronted priests with obscenities and spray-painted church buildings.

Mr. Kaczynski accused protesters of seeking to destroy Poland late Tuesday and called on his party’s supporters to defend churches at any cost.

He spoke to a camera backed by Polish flags in an announcement that some critics compared to a notorious announcement of martial law in 1981 by communist leader Wojciech Jaruzelski.

Some saw his words as an incitement to violence, since the 71-year-old holds the job of deputy prime minister in charge of police and security services.

Bartosz Weglarczyk, the editor of the new portal Onet, argued that Mr. Kaczynski was in effect giving permission to soccer hooligans and far-right extremists to beat people in the streets.

These words are shocking. These words can foreshadow anything, including the introduction of a state of emergency, censorship, arrests and God knows what else, Mr. Weglarczyk wrote.

The Women’s Strike, the key organisers of the protests over the past week, called the strike under the slogan: We are not going to work.

23,2020/10/28,"Turkey to take legal, diplomatic steps against French caricature of Erdogan","State media also reported that Turkish prosecutors had launched an investigation into Charlie Hebdo's executives.

Turkey said on Wednesday it will take legal and diplomatic steps in response to a caricature of President Tayyip Erdogan in the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, which officials called a “disgusting effort” to ”spread its cultural racism and hatred”.

Turkish anger at the caricature added fuel to a row between Turkey and France about cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, which flared after a teacher who had shown pupils the cartoons in a lesson on freedom of speech was beheaded in France this month.

The cartoon on the cover of Charlie Hebdo showed Mr. Erdogan sitting in a white T-shirt and underpants, holding a canned drink along with a woman wearing an Islamic hijab.

“Our people should have no doubt that all necessary legal and diplomatic steps will be taken against the caricature in question,” Turkey's Communications Directorate said.

“Our battle against these rude, ill-intentioned and insulting steps will continue until the end with reason but determination,” it said in a statement.

Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul told reporters in Ankara that Turkish authorities had taken all necessary initiatives with the relevant authorities. State media also reported that Turkish prosecutors had launched an investigation into Charlie Hebdo's executives.

Top Turkish officials had condemned the caricature, with presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin saying it had no respect for “any belief, sacredness and values” and showed “their own vulgarity and immorality.” He said the caricature could not be considered freedom of expression.

Turkish presidential communications director Fahrettin Altun said “Macrons anti-Muslim agenda is bearing fruit!”

“We condemn this most disgusting effort by this publication to spread its cultural racism and hatred,” Mr. Altun wrote on Twitter.

Mr. Erdogan sharply criticised Mr. Macron at the weekend, saying the French leader needed a mental health check, prompting France to recall its ambassador from Ankara. On Monday, Mr. Erdogan urged a boycott of French products.

24,2020/10/28,"China is a predator, Pompeo tells Sri Lanka","Addressing a joint press conference with his Sri Lankan counterpart Dinesh Gunawardena after bilateral talks, the top US diplomat said that the US and Sri Lanka shared a democratic vision

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday slammed China for operating as a “predator” in Sri Lanka, while the U.S. came as a “friend”. He made the remark during his visit to Colombo, amid a heightening geopolitical contest playing out in the island nation.

“We see from bad deals, violations of sovereignty and lawlessness on land and sea that the Chinese Communist Party is a predator, and the United States comes in a different way, we come as a friend, and as a partner,” Mr. Pompeo told a media conference in Colombo, winding up his 12-hour trip, the second stop on his four-nation tour spanning India, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Indonesia.

The Chinese Embassy in Colombo was quick to respond to Mr. Pompeo’s attack. “Sorry Mr. Secretary @SecPompeo, we’re busy promoting #China-#SriLanka friendship and cooperation, not interested in your #AlienVsPredator game invitation. The US can play two roles at the same time as always,” the Embassy said in a tweet from its handle.

The U.S.’s growing concern over China in the region — which dominated the Quadrilateral dialogue, or ‘Quad’ Foreign Ministers’ meet in Tokyo early October — appears to have figured prominently in Mr. Pompeo’s meeting with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was also a U.S. citizen earlier, until he gave it up last year to contest polls in Sri Lanka. An official media release from the President’s office said Mr. Rajapaksa, in his meeting with Secretary Pompeo, underscored Beijing’s crucial assistance to Colombo in the post-war years and reiterated that Sri Lanka is “not caught in a debt trap”, in addition to welcoming more American investment.

Chinese delegation

It was in line with his message a top Chinese delegation visiting Colombo earlier this month. Pledging to pursue a China-style development model, Mr. Rajapaksa told the delegation from Beijing that he wished to disprove the prevalent “debt trap” analysis of Sri Lanka’s borrowings — totalling over $5 billion — from the Asian giant.

Further, President Rajapaksa in his meeting with Secretary Pompeo “stressed that he is not ready to compromise the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation in maintaining foreign relations whatever the circumstances may be,” his office said in the statement.

While India and China’s competing strategic interests in Sri Lanka are well known, the tension between the U.S. and China escalated around Mr. Pompeo’s visit, even before the open diplomatic clash on Wednesday. Responding to U.S. Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Dean Thompson’s remarks ahead of Mr. Pompeo’s visit, the Chinese Embassy in Colombo issued a statement, saying the U.S. was using the visit to “interfere in China-Sri Lanka relations, and to coerce and bully Sri Lanka”.

Reliance on Beijing

Even as government critics flag the Rajapaksa administration's growing reliance on China for economic help — a $500 million Chinese loan was sanctioned in March and Colombo is negotiating another $700 million loan — the Sri Lankan President told Mr. Pompeo that Colombo’s foreign policy was “based on neutrality”. Sri Lanka, over the last decade, has borrowed heavily from bilateral partners and multilateral agencies, and is due to repay $4.5 billion next year.

While Chinese loans account for 10% of Sri Lanka’s foreign debt, international sovereign bonds — in which U.S. is a key investor — account for nearly 40%. Although Sri Lanka, particularly the Rajapaksa camp, has resisted the U.S.’s position on its human rights record, the U.S. remains Sri Lanka’s single largest export market.

In his remarks to the press, Mr. Pompeo said the State Department has offered “substantial counter-terrorism assistance” to help Sri Lankans bring those behind the Easter terror bombings to justice. “These Easter Sunday attacks represent the kind of sectarianism that Sri Lankans are ready to leave behind forever.”

Further, referring to President Rajapaksa’s “victory speech” following his big election win last year, stating he is President of all citizens, not of only those who voted for him, Mr. Pompeo said the U.S. was “counting on” those words to hold true. “We fully expect that Sri Lanka will fulfil its pledges to take meaningful, concrete steps to promote accountability, justice, and reconciliation,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/27wwn9/article32962206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POMPEOSRILANKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-vision-of-sri-lanka-very-different-from-predator-china-pompeo/article32962148.ece

China has accused United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of “repeating old lies” and “violating the norms of international relations”, and told Washington “the boundary question is a bilateral matter between China and India” and “there is no space for a third party to intervene.”

Two strong statements from the Foreign Ministry in Beijing and the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi followed Mr. Pompeo’s remarks at Tuesday’s 2+2 ministerial dialogue, which he attended along with Secretary of Defence Mark Esper, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.

Mr. Pompeo said the U.S. “will stand with the people of India as they face threats to their sovereignty and their liberty.” He also hit out at the Communist Party of China (CPC), saying it was “no friend to democracy, the rule of law, transparency, nor to freedom of navigation, the foundation of a free and open and prosperous Indo-Pacific.”

‘Preaching confrontation’

The Chinese Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. of “preaching an outdated Cold War mentality and preaching confrontation and geopolitical games”, and told Washington to not involve itself in the boundary dispute.

“I want to say that the border affairs between China and India are things between the two countries,” its spokesperson Wang Wenbin said. “Now the situation across the border is generally stable and the two sides are in resolving relevant issues through consultations and negotiations”.

In a statement, the Chinese Embassy said the U.S. was looking to “stir up confrontation among different groups and blocs and to stoke geopolitical competition.”

“China has been advocating that the development of bilateral relations between countries should be conducive to regional peace, stability and development, and not infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of a third party. The boundary question is a bilateral matter between China and India. The two sides have been discussing disengagement and de-escalation in the border areas through diplomatic and military channels. China and India have the wisdom and ability to handle their differences properly. There’s no space for a third party to intervene,” it stated.

India and the U.S. discussed the situation in Ladakh at the dialogue, with the eighth round of Corps Commander-level talks expected to take place soon, with little progress towards disengagement and a return to the status quo in the wake of China’s mobilisation of troops and transgressions across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) starting early May.

On Mr. Pompeo’s remarks on the CPC, the embassy statement said he “repeated old lies, attacked and made allegations against China, violated the norms of international relations and basic principles of diplomacy, instigated China’s relations with other countries in the region, which once again exposed their Cold War mentality and ideological bias,” adding that China “expresses its firm opposition to it”.

U.S.’ COVID-19 response

The statement also hit out at the U.S. government for its response to the COVID-19 pandemic and accused it of “trying to shift the blame”.

It said: “This year, under the leadership of the CPC, the Chinese people have achieved strategic victory in fighting the virus. The U.S. side once again tries to shift the blame onto China on COVID-19, which is indeed distorting facts to mislead the public. What China has done and achieved in our fight against the virus are open for all to see. We hope U.S. politicians could focus on their own epidemic response and saving lives instead of shifting the blame on others.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mgqfdk/article32957300.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJNATH-POMPEO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/boundary-issue-with-india-is-bilateral-china-tells-mike-pompeo/article32961137.ece
26,2020/10/28,"Qatar apologises, investigates forced airport examinations of female passengers","Qatar offered no immediate explanation of how officials decided to perform invasive vaginal examinations on the women.

Qatar apologised on October 28 after authorities forcibly examined female passengers from a Qatar Airways flight to Australia to try to identify who might have given birth to a newborn baby found abandoned at the airport earlier this month.

Under pressure after Australia condemned the searches, Qatar’s government said it had begun an investigation into the treatment of the women who were taking Qatar Airways Flight 908 to Sydney on October 2.

Qatar offered no immediate explanation of how officials decided to perform invasive vaginal examinations on the women. Human rights activists describe such examinations conducted under duress as equivalent to sexual assault.

The small, energy-rich country on the Arabian Peninsula is a major hub for East-West travel and host nation for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Hamad International Airport is the main hub for state-owned long-haul carrier Qatar Airways.

In Qatar, like much of the Middle East, sex outside of marriage is a criminal act. Migrant workers in the past have hidden pregnancies and tried to travel abroad to give birth, and others have abandoned their babies anonymously to avoid prison.

Qatar’s Government Communications Office issued a statement early Wednesday that “authorities discovered the newborn concealed in a plastic bag and buried under garbage” at the airport.

It called the discovery an egregious and life-threatening violation of the law. The statement said officials searched for the baby’s parents, including on flights in the vicinity of where the newborn was found.

“While the aim of the urgently decided search was to prevent the perpetrators of the horrible crime from escaping, the state of Qatar regrets any distress or infringement on the personal freedoms of any traveler caused by this action,” the government said in a statement.

Qatar said its investigation would be shared internationally. Australia on October 27 had described the situation as inappropriate and beyond circumstances in which the women could give free and informed consent. Australian Federal Police also are examining the matter.

Australia’s Seven Network News reported the women were examined in an ambulance on the tarmac. A male passenger said the women were taken from the plane regardless of their age and no explanation was given afterward.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/i0utut/article32960706.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/QATARAUSTRALIAEXAMINATIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qatar-apologises-investigates-forced-airport-examinations-of-female-passengers/article32960668.ece
27,2020/10/28,"Iran building at underground nuclear facility, confirms UN atomic watchdog","Iran also continues to stockpile greater amounts of low-enriched uranium, but does not appear to possess enough to produce a weapon, according to the agency head.

Inspectors from the UN’s atomic watchdog have confirmed Iran has started building an underground centrifuge assembly plant after its previous one exploded in what Tehran called a sabotage attack over the summer, the agency’s head told The Associated Press.

Iran also continues to stockpile greater amounts of low-enriched uranium, but does not appear to possess enough to produce a weapon, Rafael Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the AP in an interview in Berlin on Tuesday.

Following the July explosion at the Natanz nuclear site, Tehran said it would build a new, more secure, structure in the mountains around the area. Satellite pictures of Natanz analysed by experts have yet to show any obvious signs of excavation at the site in Iran’s central Isfahan province.

They have started, but it’s not completed, Mr. Grossi said. It’s a long process. He would not give further details, saying it’s confidential information. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran’s nuclear department, last month told state television the destroyed above-ground facility was being replaced with one in the heart of the mountains around Natanz. Natanz hosts the country’s main uranium enrichment facility. In its long underground halls, centrifuges rapidly spin uranium hexafluoride gas to enrich uranium.

Natanz, again

Natanz became a flashpoint for Western fears about Iran’s nuclear program in 2002, when satellite photos showed Iran building an underground facility at the site, some 200 kilometers south of the capital, Tehran. In 2003, the IAEA visited Natanz, which Iran said would house centrifuges for its nuclear program, buried under some 7.6 meters of concrete. That offers protection from potential airstrikes on the site, which also is guarded by anti-aircraft positions.

Natanz had been targeted by the Stuxnet computer virus previously, which was believed to be a creation of the U.S. and Israel. Iran has yet to say who it suspects of carrying out the sabotage in the July incident. Suspicion has fallen on Israel as well, despite a claim of responsibility by a previously unheard-of group at the time.

Under the provisions of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran is allowed to produce a certain amount of enriched uranium for non-military purposes.

In return, Iran was offered economic incentives by the countries involved.

Since President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. unilaterally out of the deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions, however, the other signatories — Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China — have been struggling to keep the deal alive.

Also read | Explained: The current state of the Iran nuclear deal

Not enough uranium

Meanwhile, Iran has been steadily exceeding the deal’s limits on how much uranium it can stockpile, the purity to which it can enrich uranium and other restrictions to pressure those countries to come up with a plan to offset U.S. sanctions.

Still though, Iran has continued to allow IAEA inspectors full access to its nuclear facilities, including Natanz, Mr. Grossi said.

In the latest IAEA quarterly report, the agency reported Iran as of August 25 had stockpiled 2,105.4 kilograms of low-enriched uranium, well above the 202.8 kilograms allowed under the JCPOA. It was also enriching uranium to a purity of 4.5%, higher than the 3.67% allowed under the deal.

In the next report, due in coming weeks, Mr. Grossi said: We continue to see the same trend that we have seen so far. According to a widely cited analysis by the Washington-based Arms Control Association, Iran would need roughly 1,050 kilograms of low-enriched uranium — under 5% purity — in gas form and would then need to enrich it further to weapons-grade, or more than 90% purity, to make a nuclear weapon.

The IAEA’s current assessment is, however, that Iran does not at the moment possess a significant quantity of uranium — defined by the agency as enough to produce a bomb — according to Mr. Grossi.

At the moment, I’m not in contact with my inspectors, but by memory, I wouldn’t say so, he said.

“All of these are projections and the IAEA is not into speculation” he added. “What may happen? What could happen? We are inspectors, we say the amounts that we see. Iran insists it has no interest in producing a bomb,” and Grossi noted that before the JCPOA, Iran had enriched its uranium up to 20% purity, which is just a short technical step away from the weapons-grade level of 90%. And in 2013, Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium was already more than 7,000 kilograms with higher enrichment, but it didn’t pursue a bomb.

The idea of a ‘significant quantity’ is a technical parameter... that applies in the context of the safeguards agreement to indicate amounts which could be theoretically used for the development of a nuclear weapon,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/j1skkm/article32960501.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKPERSIANGULFTENSIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-building-at-underground-nuclear-facility-confirms-un-atomic-watchdog/article32960502.ece
28,2020/10/28,Biden vows to back Belarus opposition in removing Lukashenko,"Mr. Biden, who leads President Donald Trump in polls ahead of next week's election, promised if he wins to “significantly expand” sanctions alongside European allies against “Lukashenko's henchmen.”

U.S. presidential hopeful Joe Biden voiced support Tuesday for the Belarus opposition in its general strike against President Alexander Lukashenko, saying the strongman was illegitimate.

Mr. Biden, who leads President Donald Trump in polls ahead of next week's election, promised if he wins to “significantly expand” sanctions alongside European allies against “Lukashenko's henchmen.”

“Although President Trump refuses to speak out on their behalf, I continue to stand with the people of Belarus and support their democratic aspirations,” Mr. Biden said in a statement.

“I also condemn the appalling human rights abuses committed by the Lukashenko regime,” Mr. Biden said.

“No leader who tortures his own people can ever claim legitimacy.”

Workers at factories on Monday started a strike after a deadline for Mr. Lukashenko to resign set by Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who contested him in August elections.

Ms. Tikhanovskaya claims to have won the election but Mr. Lukashenko insists he was the victor and has deployed deadly force against nationwide protests.

Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun in August visited Ms. Tikhanovskaya in Lithuania, where she has fled, and the United States and European Union have joined in sanctions against Mr. Lukashenko associates.

On Saturday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on Ms. Lukashenko to seek the release of a U.S. citizen and voice support for “the democratic aspirations of the people of Belarus,” according to the State Department.

But Mr. Trump has also sparked controversy by praising autocratic leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr. Lukashenko's primary international ally.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/exj8w4/article32958951.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020BIDEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/biden-vows-to-back-belarus-opposition-in-removing-lukashenko/article32958952.ece
29,2020/10/28,EU tells U.K. to say how long it will align with EU financial rules,"Britain has left the EU and access under transition arrangements ends on Dec. 31.

Britain must spell out how far it wants to diverge from European Union rules if it wants access to the bloc's financial market from January, a top European Commission official said on Tuesday.

Britain has left the EU and access under transition arrangements ends on Dec. 31. Future access for the City of London hinges on U.K. financial rules staying aligned or ”equivalent” to regulation in the bloc.

John Berrigan, head of the European Commission's financial services unit, said Brussels has asked London for more clarification on Britain's intentions to work out what is an ”acceptable level” of divergence.

“We are almost ready,” Mr. Berrigan told the European Parliament.

“There will be divergence... but we have to get some mutual understanding of how much divergence is likely to happen, and is that going to be sufficient to allow us to maintain an equivalence arrangement.”

Brussels has granted temporary access for U.K. clearing houses, but chunks of stock and derivatives trading would move from London to the bloc without equivalence.

Separately, Britain and the EU are discussing a trade deal which would contain only limited references to financial services to avoid tying the bloc's hands, Mr. Berrigan said.

“We see our regulatory cooperation in the financial services field outside the agreement,” he said.

It would consist of a “forum” similar to what the bloc has with the United States to assess potential divergence in rules ahead of time, he said.

“What we don't want is an equivalence regime that is constantly under threat,” he said.

“We will need at the outset the direction of travel the U.K. want to go... so we don't have to keep talking in emergencies about whether equivalence can be maintained or not.”

Britain has said that while it won't weaken its high regulatory standards, it won't be a “rule taker” or copy every EU regulation word-for-word to obtain market access.

Mr. Berrigan said market participants are generally ready for the “unavoidably fragmenting event” that full Brexit will be in January.

No trade deal would make future cooperation in financial services far more challenging, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/t29xto/article32958879.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BREXIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eu-tells-uk-to-say-how-long-it-will-align-with-eu-financial-rules/article32958880.ece
30,2020/10/28,"U.S. Presidential Elections | Melania Trump slams Biden, Democrats in first solo campaign stop","Mrs. Trump also denounced what she called Mr. Biden’s “socialist agenda” and criticized media coverage of “idle gossip and palace intrigue” in the White House.

Melania Trump lined up squarely with her husband Tuesday on her first solo trip of the 2020 campaign, slamming Joe Biden, Democrats and the media as she pushed the president’s re-election message in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.

The first lady defended Donald Trump’s record on COVID-19 even as he continues to play down the threat of a virus that has killed more than 226,000 Americans. She sought to shift the blame to Democrats, who she said tried to “put their own agendas ahead of the American people’s well-being” and focused on a “sham impeachment” instead of the coronavirus.

Mrs. Trump also denounced what she called Mr. Biden’s “socialist agenda” and criticized media coverage of “idle gossip and palace intrigue” in the White House.

Mr. Biden’s “policies and socialist agenda will only serve to destroy America and all that has been built in the past four years,” she said. “We must keep Donald in the White House so he can finish what he’s started and our country can continue to flourish.”

The first lady, who recently recovered from what she has described as a mild case of COVID-19, appeared on a day when Pennsylvania health authorities reported a recording-shattering 2,751 new virus infections state-wide. COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations in Pennsylvania have more than doubled since the beginning of October.

Mrs. Trump also struck an empathetic tone on the virus, calling herself a “worried mother and wife” who knows “there are many people who have lost loved ones or know people who have been forever impacted by this silent enemy.”

But she defended her husband’s handling of the virus and said his administration “chooses to keep moving forward during this pandemic, not backward,” insisting that schools, restaurants and businesses have learned to operate safely during the pandemic.

""We don’t close down and hide in fear. We get to work to find real and lasting solutions,” she said.

The first lady’s event 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Philadelphia drew a couple of hundred supporters who piled into a converted barn typically used for wedding receptions. Two large doors at the rear were opened to allow fresh air into the building. The overwhelming majority of those in attendance wore masks, but there was little social distancing.

Pennsylvania Democratic Chairwoman Nancy Patton Mills ridiculed Mrs. Trump’s campaign stop, saying the first lady would not have an answer for Pennsylvania’s soaring unemployment rate or why her husband’s administration has “stopped trying to combat a virus that’s killed 8,700 Pennsylvanians and counting.”

Mrs. Trump spoke one day after the president held three rallies in Pennsylvania, a state that helped deliver him the White House in 2016 and one that is key to his reelection bid. Polls show a tight race in the state between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, who also visited the state Monday to boost get-out-the-vote efforts.

President Trump and the first lady flew together on Marine One from the White House to Joint Base Andrews before boarding planes for separate campaign trips.

""I’d like to go with her and be with her,” Mr. Trump said. “She’s going to make a speech in Pennsylvania. That’s great. She does very well, very popular.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5uaoeh/article32958871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MELANIATRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-elections-melania-trump-slams-biden-democrats-in-first-solo-campaign-stop/article32958872.ece
31,2020/10/28,Philadelphia police to boost response after shooting death of Black man sparks unrest,"The violence is the latest in months of anti-racism protests across the United States since the May 25 death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American, after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

Philadelphia will deploy additional police officers and has asked surrounding regions for law enforcement support as it braces for further unrest on Tuesday sparked by the police killing of a Black man, the police commissioner said.

Protests erupted on Monday following the death of 27-year-old Walter Wallace, who was shot multiple times by two police officers who were instructing him to back off and to put down a knife, a bystander's video shared on social media shows.

While the demonstrations began peacefully on Monday at Malcolm X Park on the west side of the city, they later turned violent, causing significant damage to businesses and leading to 91 arrests, commissioner Danielle Outlaw told a briefing.

“For today and this evening we anticipate the chance of additional incidents of civil unrest and as such we will be taking additional steps to ensure order,” Outlaw said, adding that she had asked surrounding counties for help.

“Roving and static officer details that are part of the looting response team will also be deployed to commercial districts and other key locations throughout the city.”

The violence is the latest in months of anti-racism protests across the United States since the May 25 death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American, after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said the video of the shooting presented “difficult questions” about the actions of the officers. “Last night we saw further evidence of the anguish of Black and Brown residents of our city who have struggled their entire lives under systemic racism,” he told the briefing.

But he also expressed sympathy for the officers injured in the protests and for the business owners whose shops were damaged, much of it along the bustling 52nd Street on the city's west side. He stressed that the law would be enforced.

“Vandalism and looting is not an acceptable form of First Amendment expression,” Kenney said, referring to the constitutional amendment guaranteeing freedom of speech.

Outlaw said a total of 91 arrests have been made, including 11 for assaulting officers and 76 for burglaries. Of the 30 officers injured, 29 were in stable condition after mainly being hit by bricks and other projectiles. One officer who was run over by a truck was being treated in a hospital, Outlaw said.

Video taken by a bystander and shared widely on social media showed Wallace approaching two police officers who drew their guns after warning him to put down the knife. The video shows the officers backing up, then cuts briefly from view as gunfire erupts and Wallace is shown slumping to the pavement.

Chief Inspector Frank Vanore said the police had responded to a call about a man screaming who was armed with a knife, and that each officer fired about seven rounds. But he declined to go into further detail, citing the ongoing investigation.

John McNesby, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #5, defended the officers in a statement.

“Our police officers are being vilified for doing their job and keeping the community safe, after being confronted by a man with a knife. We support and defend these officers, as they too are traumatized by being involved in a fatal shooting.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ur6o5e/article32958869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PHILADELPHIAPOLICESHOOTING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/philadelphia-police-to-boost-response-after-shooting-death-of-black-man-sparks-unrest/article32958870.ece
32,2020/10/28,Abortion protests are attempt to 'destroy Poland': ruling party,"Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is also the deputy prime minister in charge of security and is widely seen as the country's real powerbroker, criticised the “nihilism” and “vulgarity” of the protests.

The influential leader of Poland's ruling party on Tuesday criticised protests against a near-total ban on abortion as an attempt to “destroy” the nation and rallied party members to defend Catholic churches.

Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is also the deputy prime minister in charge of security and is widely seen as the country's real powerbroker, criticised the “nihilism” and “vulgarity” of the protests.

“I call on all members of PiS (Law and Justice) and all those who support us to defend Polish churches at any cost,” Mr. Kaczynski said in a televised address.

He said the protests “aim to destroy Poland”.

Poland has seen six consecutive days of demonstrations against a ruling by the constitutional court which, when published, will rule out abortions in all cases except rape and when the life of the mother is at risk.

Poland, a country of 38 million people, already has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe and fewer than 2,000 abortions are carried out per year.

It is estimated that some 200,000 Polish women travel abroad for terminations, including to neighbouring Ukraine and Germany, or have illegal abortions.

Poland is a predominantly Catholic country but the influence of the Catholic Church is waning among younger generations and some of the protests have focused on churches across the country.

Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki earlier on Tuesday said that “acts of aggression, barbarism and vandalism are absolutely unacceptable,” and warned protesters that any violence could lead to an “escalation”.

One of the protests on Tuesday was in the parliament.

Centrist and left-wing lawmakers held up placards and shouted pro-choice slogans at Kaczynski, after the conservative speaker of parliament compared the protest symbol of a red lightning bolt to Nazi imagery.

The session was suspended amid angry scenes.

The protests began on Thursday when the constitutional court on Thursday, after being petitioned by PiS lawmakers, ruled that an existing law allowing the abortion of damaged foetuses was “incompatible” with the constitution.

Opponents of the ruling party say it puts women's lives at risk by forcing them to carry unviable pregnancies but supporters insist it will only stop the abortion of foetuses diagnosed with Down Syndrome.

The ruling cannot be appealed but only comes into force if it is published in the journal of laws.

It is unclear when this will happen and more protests are planned in the coming days.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pe4ofn/article32958836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POLANDABORTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/abortion-protests-are-attempt-to-destroy-poland-ruling-party/article32958837.ece
33,2020/10/28,France warns citizens to be cautious as protests build in several countries over Prophet cartoons,"In a sign that some countries want to limit the fallout, Saudi Arabia, while condemning the cartoons, held back from echoing calls in other countries for a boycott of French products.

France warned its citizens in several Muslim-majority countries to take extra security precautions on Tuesday as anger surged over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, and the head of Russia’s Chechnya region said Paris was pushing people towards terrorism.

In Bangladesh, thousands of protesters marched through the capital, with some stamping on a poster of French President Emmanuel Macron, and Iran summoned the French charge d’affaires to register a protest over the cartoons.

But in a sign that some countries want to limit the fallout, Saudi Arabia — while condemning the cartoons — held back from echoing calls in other parts of the Muslim world for a boycott of French products.

The row has its roots in a knife attack outside a French school on October 16 in which a man of Chechen origin beheaded Samuel Paty, a teacher who had shown pupils cartoons of Prophet Mohammad in a civics lesson. The caricatures are considered blasphemous by Muslims.

Also read: French teacher’s killer had ‘contact’ with jihadist in Syria

The French government, backed by many citizens, saw the beheading as an attack on freedom of speech, and said they would defend the right to display the cartoons.

Mr. Macron called the teacher a hero, and he pledged to fight “Islamist separatism”, saying it was threatening to take over some Muslim communities in France.

France’s foreign ministry on Tuesday issued safety advice to French citizens in Indonesia, Turkey, Bangladesh, Iraq and Mauritania, advising them to exercise caution. They should stay away from any protests over the cartoons and avoid any public gatherings.

“It is recommended to exercise the greatest vigilance, especially while travelling, and in places that are frequented by tourists or expatriate communities,” it said.

Instagram warning

Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia’s majority-Muslim region of Chechnya, addressed Mr. Macron in a post on Instagram.

“You are forcing people into terrorism, pushing people towards it, not leaving them any choice, creating the conditions for the growth of extremism in young people’s heads. You can boldly call yourself the leader and inspiration of terrorism in your country,” Mr. Kadyrov wrote.

Asked by Reuters to comment, an official in the French presidential administration said: “We won’t be intimidated and we put on notice those who sow hatred, which in Kadyrov’s case, is unacceptable.”

The images of the Prophet were first published years ago by a French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, whose editorial offices were attacked in 2015 by gunmen who killed 12 people.

Since Paty’s killing, French people protesting in solidarity have displayed the cartoons in the street, and they were projected on to a building in one city. French officials have closed a Paris mosque they said was fanning anger over the cartoons.

Calls for a boycott of French goods were trending over the weekend on social media in Saudi Arabia, but officials have not backed them, favouring a measured approach.

A Saudi foreign ministry official said on Tuesday the Gulf state condemns all acts of terrorism, an apparent reference to Paty’s killing.

“Freedom of expression and culture should be a beacon of respect, tolerance and peace that rejects practices and acts which generate hatred, violence and extremism and are contrary to coexistence,” the official said in a statement.

The daily Arab News on Tuesday cited the head of the Saudi-based Muslim World League, Mohammed al-Issa, as cautioning that an over-reaction “that is negative and goes beyond what is acceptable” would only benefit “haters”.

Turkish unity

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Monday asked his compatriots to stop buying French goods and accused France of pursuing an anti-Islam agenda.

Previous Turkish calls for boycotts of foreign goods have fizzled out, but Industry and Technology Minister Mustafa Varank on Tuesday urged business-people to enforce the boycott. “We must show a strong stance,” he said.

In a rare show of unity, four Turkish parties, including the main opposition group, issued a joint declaration saying Mr. Macron was being “reckless” in pushing freedom of expression, and his stance could trigger harmful conflict.

In Jordan, around 50 protesters gathered outside the heavily guarded French embassy in the capital, Amman.

“This is not freedom of speech — when other people’s religions are infringed upon,” said former member of parliament, Dima Tahboub, referring to the stance taken by Paris on the cartoons. “This is an obvious attack.”

France has been on high alert following the beheading and areas around the Arc de Triomphe and Eiffel Tower in central Paris were evacuated briefly on Tuesday in security alerts. There was no evidence the alerts were linked to the cartoons row.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y4lw93/article32958827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FRANCE-SECURITYBOYCOTT-JORDAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/france-warns-citizens-to-be-cautious-as-anger-seethes-in-muslim-world-over-cartoons/article32958828.ece

There is still no effective COVID-19 vaccine, but the first shots could be available at the beginning of next year, the Commission said earlier in October.

Given a likely limited supply, the Commission has for months urged E.U. governments to devise vaccination plans that would prioritise vulnerable and essential groups, such as healthcare workers, the elderly or people with chronic diseases .

But apart from a consensus on inoculating doctors and nurses, “there is no common line on other groups,” the Commission official said at the internal meeting this week.

In July a paper agreed by the Commission and E.U. governments said at least 40% of the E.U. population should be vaccinated in the first phase.

Some E.U. countries want to book doses for their entire population with the aim of rolling them out already by mid-2021.

A third E.U. official said this bold goal could be achieved if the E.U. reached supply deals with at least seven vaccine candidates.

35,2020/10/28,Azerbaijan accuses Armenia of deadly missile strike on civilians,"With clashes over the disputed Caucasus region entering a second month, international mediators are pushing to bring a stop to frontline clashes and shelling of civilian areas that have left hundreds dead.

Azerbaijan accused Armenia of a missile attack that killed four civilians Tuesday, as Washington urged the two sides to abide by a ceasefire aimed at halting weeks of fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh.

With clashes over the disputed Caucasus region entering a second month, international mediators are pushing to bring a stop to frontline clashes and shelling of civilian areas that have left hundreds dead.

A U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreed at the weekend -- the third attempt at a truce -- unravelled within minutes on Monday with the two countries trading accusations of new attacks.

Azerbaijani presidential aide Hikmet Hajiyev said Tuesday that Armenian forces had fired missiles on a village in the country’s Barda region near the frontline, killing four civilians, including a two-year-old girl, and wounding 13 others.

He claimed cluster bombs had been used and accused Armenia of an “indiscriminate and targeted attack against civilians”.

“In violation of humanitarian ceasefire and in order to compensate their sustained military losses, Armenia resorts to war crimes of killing civilians,” Hajiyev said in English on Twitter.

Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan denied the claim as “an absolute lie and a dirty provocation”.

Karabakh’s rights ombudsman Artak Beglaryan accused Azerbaijani forces of “deliberately targeting civilians” by firing rockets carrying cluster munitions Tuesday into a village in the region’s Martuni district, wounding three women.

‘No military solution’

Azerbaijan and Armenia have been locked in a bitter conflict over Karabakh since Armenian separatists backed by Yerevan seized control of the mountainous province in a 1990s war that left 30,000 people dead.

Karabakh’s self-declared independence has not been recognised internationally, even by Armenia, and it remains a part of Azerbaijan under international law.

The current fighting broke out on September 27. Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of having targeted civilians and of breaking the previous truces.

In separate phone calls with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged them to stand by the ceasefire agreed on Sunday.

Pompeo “pressed the leaders to abide by their commitments to cease hostilities and pursue a diplomatic solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,” the State Department said in a statement.

Pompeo told the two leaders that “there is no military solution to this conflict,” the State Department said.

Russia, France and the United States are leaders of the “Minsk Group” which has failed since the 1990s to bring about a negotiated settlement to the conflict.

Fresh frontline fighting

This year’s fighting is the heaviest since a 1994 ceasefire, raising fears that both Russia, which has a military alliance with Armenia, and Azerbaijan’s ally Turkey could be further drawn into the conflict.

Azerbaijan has claimed to be making significant gains since the fighting began by retaking areas it lost in the 1990s war, in particular in a buffer zone outside Karabakh seized by the Armenians.

Armenia has admitted to suffering losses and called on volunteers to join the fighting at the front.

The two countries’ defence ministries said fighting was continuing along the frontline on Tuesday.

More than 1,000 people have been reported dead in the fighting, mainly Armenian separatist fighters but also dozens of civilians on both sides.

Azerbaijan has not released any figures on its military casualties and the death toll is believed to be substantially higher, with Russian President Vladimir Putin saying last week that close to 5,000 people had been killed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/agafbl/article32957855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AZERBAIJAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/azerbaijan-accuses-armenia-of-deadly-missile-strike-on-civilians/article32957856.ece
36,2020/10/28,Bihar Assembly election | All SOPs were followed in phase 1: EC,"Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora on Wednesday said polling in phase one of Bihar Assembly election, the first general elections to be held during the COVID-19 pandemic, had been carried out with all COVID-19-safety standard operating procedures (SOPs) in place and that voters cast their ballots in a disciplined manner.

Speaking at the Election Commission’s (EC) post-polling briefing, Mr. Arora said despite the pandemic, the turnout till 5 p.m. had been 52.24%. He thanked the voters, political parties and administration in Bihar for their participation. From entering the polling station till casting votes, all SOPs — thermal scanning at the gate, hand sanitisers being made available and wearing gloves while casting the vote — were followed, he said. “For the EC, it was a leap of faith and not a leap in the dark.”

The EC had extended the timing of polling by one hour and increased the number of polling stations to limit electors per station to 1,000. Mr. Arora said 0.22% of ballot units, 0.25% of control units and 1.28% of VVPATs had to be replaced during phase 1. He said he hoped that Bihar electors would beat previous records of turnout in phase two and phase three of polling next month. Deputy Election Commissioner (DEC) in-charge of Bihar Chandra Bhushan said 89 cases under the IPC and NDMA had been lodged for violating COVID-19 norms. He added that senior citizens over 80 years of age and persons with disabilities had been extended the option of postal ballots.

37,2020/10/28,Bihar Assembly elections | Owaisi banks on his anti-CAA stand,"The AIMIM’s expansion may come at the cost of Mahagathbandhan

The venue is Janta Haat, in Kochadhaman, in Kishanganj district of north Bihar, a crowded market, selling all kinds of wares, from luridly coloured sweetmeats, to masalas, to dried fish. Men, women, children, young men on motorcycles impatiently blowing the horn, some on cycles, some others pushing their carts, all trying to inch towards the ground where under a green canopy, AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi is speaking.

Also read: Bihar Assembly elections | In poll rallies, Modi invokes Ram temple construction

Mr. Owaisi’s poll pitch is clear — AIMIM is the only party that hit the roads against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and he is the only one who had the ‘guts’ to tore the legislation in Parliament. The remaining others are betraying the electorate and stealing their votes, he said. He points fingers at JD(U) president Nitish Kumar for garnering votes with the promise of “sangh mukt” bharat and later as Mr. Owaisi says “sipping milk in PM Modi’s lap.” “Yeh aapki ladai hai, aapke bachchon ke mustakabil ki ladai hai [This is your fight, this is the fight for your children’s future],” Mr. Owaisi said.

He appeals to the crowd to gain “zehani” or mental and “siyasi” or political freedom from these parties. He promises schools, colleges, hospital, an airport at Purnia among a long list of promises.

Patient wait

The crowd listens to him patiently, claps and roars at his words. It waits patiently till Mr Owaisi wraps up his speech, boards his helicopter and it stands around till his helicopter is no longer visible.

In a close contest, as Bihar Assembly elections 2020 are turning out to be, one of the key questions is: Will the AIMIM play a bigger role than just being a spoiler? He first came to Bihar five years ago contesting in the 2015 Assembly elections. He has managed to gain more trust since then but there are also many who reject what they call his “fundamentalist” ideas.

Also read: Bihar Assembly elections | Can’t compete with the PM Modi in lying, says Rahul Gandhi

In this election, the AIMIM is contesting in 20 seats, out of which 12 are against the RJD or the Congress. The AIMIM’s expansion will come at Mahagathbandhan’s cost.

NRC issue

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) issue may have faded out of the national debate but is very real here. There are many wild tales about what is in the offing for Muslims if the NRC is brought and how the Muslims were treated in Assam.

“They want to weed out Muslims, where should we go? Why don’t they shoot us here itself, on our land. Better to die here rather than in an alien country,” Ramzan Ali Sheikh said. He is a farmer from Butah Shadipur in the Baisi Assembly constituency. Mr. Sheikh said he was well aware that the AIMIM did not have a shot at forming a government. “I don’t want my government, I only want a leader who will raise my issues,” he said. He has been voting for the Congress, but he says, this time it is going to be ‘patang chaap’ (kite is the AIMIM’s symbol). His anger against the Congress is more because of the incumbent legislator Abdus Subhan who has been around for two decades. In Baisi, there are others who talk about Mr. Owaisi’s rescue work during recent floods.

Anger at Cong.

Miles away at a tea shop in Simalbari in the Kishanganj constituency, 23-year-old Khurshid Alam expresses dissatisfaction with the Congress’s ‘lukewarm’ response to legislation on the CAA and triple talaq. There are a few, who point out that the Congress being a national party, could not have taken a more belligerent stand. Zia-ur-Rehman, a farmer, concurs with Mr. Alam. “The lockdown was imposed to clamp down on CAA and NRC protests. Where did COVID go now. Is COVID only for the common man, not for netas who hold big rallies,” he questioned. He derisively added, “Woh bolte hai Seemanchal mini Pakistan hai, toh phir thik hai [they call Seemanchal mini Pakistan, it’s okay then],” only to be stopped by others mid sentence. All though, agree that the AIMIM is a far more powerful counter to the BJP than the Congress or the RJD. In the 2019 bypolls, the AIMIM won the Kishanganj Assembly constituency, giving it its first berth in the Bihar Assembly.

Young, old divide

The AIMIM is also courting the Dalit community with Jai Bheem and Jai Meem narrative. His supporters claim that Mr. Owaisi is the only one who talks on constitutional lines. There is a young and old divide too, with the younger lot seeing the AIMIM as the fresh alternative to the RJD and the Congress. The older voters are worried about the party’s strident line. “We do not need fundamentalist discourse here,” Naushad Alam, from the Palsa panchayat in the Amour Assembly constituency, said. Pointing to his neighbour, Mr. Alam added, “He is a Yadav, when he and I do not have a problem eating together or mingling together why should any one else have. This is my India and his. It is ours.”

There are others like Mr. Alam who are repulsed by the AIMIM. At Manchata, in Amour constituency, Mohammed Salim criticised Mr. Owaisi for holding a rally in the area on Navmi, which, he said, is sacred for both Hindu and Muslims. “He makes inflammatory speeches. What is the point of raising Akhlaq issue on Navmi here, where we sacrifice goats for Ma Durga,” Mr. Salim said.

The AIMIM’s Bihar president Akhtarul Iman is contesting here.

Regardless of the critics, the AIMIM’s presence has visibly grown. There are more AIMIM posters than that of the Congress or RJD and more campaign vehicles blaring out loud pleas to vote on “patang chap”. It is still not clear whether he has the critical mass of support to play more than a spoiler’s role in this election, regardless, the AIMIM has made it a close contest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6hga2q/article32965763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG4262-2,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/in-bihar-owaisi-banks-on-his-anti-caa-stand/article32965764.ece
38,2020/10/28,Bihar Assembly Elections | Phase 1 sees 54% turnout,"Polling largely peaceful amid reports of clashes and EVM malfunctioning in a few places.

The first of the three-phase Bihar Assembly election in 71 constituencies across 16 districts ended peacefully on Wednesday, amid reports of clashes between supporters of two parties in Shahpur, Kaimur and Gaya, and electronic voting machines (EVM) not working properly in some places.

According to the Election Commission’s (EC) Voter Turnout App, the provisional polling was 54.26% that was updated till 10 p.m. Nearly 2.15 crore eligible voters exercised their franchise, marginally lower than in 2015.

The second phase of polling for 94 seats will be held on November 3, while the third one will be on November 7 for 78 seats. Counting of votes will be done on November 10.

Bihar Assembly elections, phase 1 | Updates

FIR lodged

An FIR was lodged at the Kotwali police station in Gaya against Prem Kumar, BJP candidate and Agriculture Minister in the Nitish Kumar Cabinet, for wearing a mask with the party logo while casting his vote at a polling booth. However, Mr. Kumar later told mediapersons that “it was unintentional and he couldn’t throw attention to it as he was busy”.

Amid the polling, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi addressed three and two public meetings respectively in the State for the second phase of polls.

Young voters in queues

Young voters between the ages of 18 and 35 and women were mostly seen in queues to exercise their franchise at many places. There were reports of EVMs not working at some booths in the Suryagarha constituency of Lakhisarai, Paliganj and other places as polling began in the morning, but the problem was eventually rectified by poll officials.

Clashes between supporters of two candidates were witnessed in the Shahpur constituency of Buxar and Kaimur, while a candidate’s vehicle was damaged by some people in the Tekari constituency of Gaya district. Due to the pandemic guidelines, polling took place till 6 p.m.

“Good turnout of voters even during the COVID-19 pandemic is not a good sign for the ruling NDA as people usually turn out in large numbers to vote against the present government”, said political analyst Ajay Kumar.

As many as 1,066 candidates were in the fray for Wednesday’s polls, which took place in a total of 31,371 polling booths. The total number of electorate in this phase was 2,14,84,787. Unemployment, corruption at lower level of bureaucracy, prohibition and migration have been the main issues for voters.

COVID-19 guidelines

At some polling booths, people were seen exercising their franchise without wearing masks and without following social distancing, though at some places some of the voters and poll officials were seen following the ECI guidelines.

Out of the 71 seats in the first phase, the RJD won 27 in 2015, while the JD(U) got 18, the BJP 13, the Congress nine and others four. Principal Opposition party RJD has nominated its 25 sitting legislators, while the JD(U) and the BJP did so for 23 and 13 seats respectively. The Congress has repeated its eight MLAs, while the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) one each.

What is the reason behind it?” asked Mr. Gandhi, and added, “It’s a big and sad thing happening with the Prime Minister of India. Congress gave direction to the country…we gave MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act), waived farmers’ loan…we stood with farmers and generated employment.”

When polling for 71 seats was on in Bihar on Wednesday, at three public meetings for the second phase of elections on November 3, Prime Minister Narendra Modi invoked Ram temple construction in Ayodhya and attacked Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and chief minister face of the ‘mahagathbandan’ Tejashwi Yadav by calling him indirectly “jungle raj ka yuvraj [crown prince of of the rule of lawlessness]”.

At a public meeting in Darbhanga, Mr. Modi said, “This is the land of maa Janki [mother Sita] and after decades of struggle, Ram temple construction has started in Ayodhya now… those political people who were earlier asking for dates [of temple construction] too are now applauding the construction”, he said. “BJP ki pehchan hai..jo kehte hai, karte hain [BJP is known to fulfil what it says]”.

At public meetings in Muzaffarpur and Patna, Mr. Modi said, “Beware of this ‘jungle raj ka yuvraj’ as they [RJD] have the copyright of kidnappings. Can anything be expected from the ‘yuvraj’ of ‘jungle raj’?… their track record is there to be evaluated and people of Bihar know about it better than me.”

The RJD’s rule in the State from 1990-2005 has often been dubbed as “jungle raj”.

“People of Bihar are aware about their activities and if they return to power it would be a double whammy for the State during COVID-19 pandemic”, he claimed and asked people to “vote for NDA [National Democratic Alliance] that had brought development to the State and “pulled it out from darkness”.

“Forget about jobs… even private companies providing jobs here will flee from Bihar… extortion calls will be made by those patronised by them if they [RJD] come to power”, Mr. Modi said in an indirect reference to Mr. Tejashwi Yadav’s announcement of giving 10 lakh jobs to youths with his first signature at first Cabinet meeting, if he comes to power.

“They have the habit of commission khori [taking cut money] in every projects. Please take in mind their track record... those who made people’s life hell with crime and corruption. Their motto was paisa hajam, pariyojna khatam [money gobbled, projects end]. People of Bihar have decided to defeat them and vote for the NDA that wants to make Bihar a self-reliant State… to make Bihar free from being a bimaru [sick] State”, he stated.

Steps for farmers, poor

The Prime Minister also listed out the steps taken by the NDA government for farmers and the poor. “₹1 lakh crore has been transferred directly into farmers’ accounts, 40 lakh crore bank accounts were opened for the poor, free LPG gas connection provided and every poor man is getting medical facility up to ₹5 lakh. Even as the pandemic is on, we have ensured free ration for the poor for eight months. Very soon, Bihar too will be among those States where tap water will be available in every household”, he said.

“Developments in Darbhanga district like the opening of the All India Institute of Social Sciences [AIIMS] and the construction of an airport, software park and Ramayan circuit would help people in making connectivity”, he stated He recalled how the Kosi mahasetu project was constructed by the NDA government after a long delay. “Now, through the Kosi mahasetu, a distance of 300 km has been reduced to just 20-22 km and an eight-hour journey cut to just half-an-hour… connectivity will prove beneficial for the State as a whole”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rzyzwm/article32961879.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DARBHANGAMODI,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-elections-modi-highlights-construction-of-ram-temple/article32961880.ece
41,2020/10/28,First day of Facebook moratorium on new U.S. political ads marked by glitches,"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s digital director Rob Flaherty slammed the social media giant, saying on Twitter its systems broke “within seconds of launching the silly, performative pre-election hoop-jumping exercise”

The first day of Facebook Inc's effort to stop new political advertising being introduced in the final stretch of U.S. election campaigning was marked by complaints that the planned moratorium was beset by glitches.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's digital director Rob Flaherty slammed the social media giant on Tuesday, saying on Twitter its systems broke “within seconds of launching the silly, performative pre-election hoop-jumping exercise.”

A Biden spokesman said an undisclosed number of his campaign's ads were affected.

Under pressure to crack down on misinformation and other abuses, Facebook said last month it would impose a moratorium — or temporary ban — on new political ads in the week before November 3 in an attempt to tamp down on misinformation on social media as Election Day approached.

The company stopped accepting new political or issue ads on Tuesday. Facebook said it would allow pre-existing ads to run during that period but would block any adjustments to the ads' content or design.

A Facebook spokeswoman declined to answer Reuters questions, but Facebook's director of product management Rob Leathern said on Twitter: “We're investigating the issues of some ads being paused incorrectly, and some advertisers having trouble making changes to their campaigns.”

A message circulated by Facebook to political digital strategists said a “subset of ads may show as paused” and blamed “data lags.”

Republican and Democratic digital strategists complained that the glitches were hurting campaigns at a critical moment.

Eric Frenchman, chief marketing officer at Republican digital firm Campaign Solutions, said that several campaigns he was working with were hit by the pauses.

“Votes are being cast every day,” said Mark Jablonowski, managing partner at DSPolitical, a digital firm that works with Democratic causes. “So any time that you're not able to communicate with voters in this crucial window is time lost.”

He said that most of the Facebook ads of his roughly two dozen clients had been paused early this morning.

Ryan Morgan, the founder of Democratic digital advertising firm Veracity Media, said he'd heard of problems from several colleagues.

Campaigns rushed to submit any ads they might need for the election period ahead of the moratorium, strategists have told Reuters in recent days.

President Donald Trump's re-election campaign started running pre-prepared ads touting GDP numbers that will not be released until Thursday.

Facebook Inc said on Tuesday it had rejected a pre-prepared Trump campaign ad that told users to “vote today,” because it did not have “the proper context or clarity” — a violation of its policies.

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to Reuters questions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/cwrhmg/article32960778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28NETFACEBOOK,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/first-day-of-facebook-moratorium-on-new-us-political-ads-marked-by-glitches/article32960779.ece

The United Kingdom has entered into a strategic partnership to develop India’s fledgling international financial services centre GIFT City, and agreed to set up a new Fund of Funds to be managed by the State Bank of India group in order to route U.K.’s future capital investments into India.

India and U.K. also signed off on a new infrastructure finance and policy partnership to help India execute its National Infrastructure Pipeline that envisages investments worth $1.4 trillion, at the tenth Economic and Financial Dialogue (EFD) between the two countries steered by U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday.

“As we seek to recover from the profound impact of COVID-19, we can only do so in partnership and co-operation,” Mr. Sunak said. “Our two countries can work together to be a force for good, building back better, tackling climate change and creating jobs and prosperity. That’s been our focus today,” he added said soon after the conclusion of the dialogue, which was launched in 2007 and last held in 2017.

Stressing that a bilateral partnership driven by ‘U.K.’s deep capital markets and India’s extraordinary economic dynamism’ can help show the way ahead for a global recovery, Mr. Sunak said: “We have been able to announce a series of ambitious initiatives across trade, infrastructure, sustainable finance and research. This includes a new strategic partnership to develop the GIFT city, a tremendous opportunity to drive international capital flow from the city of London to India.”

Bilateral trade between India and the U.K. stood at £24 billion in 2019 and India is now the second-largest project investment source for the U.K.

“We establish a new U.K.-India strategic collaboration to accelerate the development of GIFT City (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City), India’s first International Financial Services Centre, and promote greater links between GIFT City and the U.K. financial services ecosystem by bringing together both governments, regulators and business to share experiences and expertise,” said the joint statement signed by both the leaders.

Under the infrastructure partnership, the UK will support India’s infrastructure pipeline by sharing experience, knowledge exchange and technical assistance to support India’s National Infrastructure Pipeline, including setting up a Project Preparation Support Facility-cum-Centre of Excellence for PPP Projects.

To mobilise private capital for green investment, a new U.K.-India Sustainable Finance Forum is also being established.

Welcoming India’s move to allow 100% tax exemptions for sovereign wealth funds investing in infrastructure, the U.K. Chancellor termed it a positive for their government’s development capital investments in India and the CDC Group, which has £1.23 billion invested in more than 300 Indian companies.

“We are pleased to note the establishment of the U.K. India Development Cooperation Fund (UKIDCF) — a Fund of Funds to be managed by the State Bank of India Group and serve as the financial and accounting platform for the U.K. Government’s future development capital investments in India,” the statement said.

COVID-19 battle

To help combat the pandemic, U.K. and India announced a joint investment of £8 million for research to understand and address the factors leading to the severity of the coronavirus in South Asian populations in U.K. and in India.

45,2020/10/28,U.S. investors want more reforms in IPO rules: SEBI,"‘Are keen to take part in sandbox set-up’

Investors from the U.S. have emphasised the need for early finalisation of direct listing proposals, development of the corporate bond market and reforms in IPO regulations, said SEBI.

In an interaction with top Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) officials, they have also shown interest in taking part in innovative ideas under the regulatory sandbox framework, the regulator said.

Ajay Tyagi, Chairman, SEBI, along with other officials, held an e-interaction with stakeholders from the U.S. on Tuesday which was organised by the U.S. India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF).

“We briefed them about key developments in the Indian economy as well as recent trends in the securities market, especially in this COVID era,” he said.

“The achievements of the Indian primary markets, secondary markets and specific products such REITs and InvITs were brought out during the interactions. The attractiveness of the Indian markets, despite the COVID1-9 impact and the recent surge in foreign investment into India through the FPI route was also emphasised,” he said.

“The increasing number of registrations of FPIs every year and increasing inflows of FPI investment in the Indian equity market signify the sustained interest of the foreign investors in the Indian capital markets,” he added.

As the largest number of FPIs and about a third of the total assets under FPIs’ custody are from the U.S., the importance of U.S. investments into India was emphasised, especially taking into account the growing partnership between the two countries, Mr. Tyagi added.

The participants appreciated the various initiatives taken by SEBI, especially with respect to direct listing proposal and creation of new products such as REITs and InvITs which have the potential to attract more foreign investment while benefiting the domestic economy given its multiplier effect.

“The initiatives taken by SEBI towards ease of participation by FPIs such as simplified registration process, common application form, onboarding during COVID1-9 through digital scanning of KYC documents were also appreciated,” SEBI said.

The SEBI team also clarified various queries raised during the meetings on multiple issues.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/pre6ar/article32966489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29BUAJAYTYAGI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/us-investors-want-more-reforms-in-ipo-rules-sebi/article32966490.ece

Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (L&T) on Wednesday reported second-quarter consolidated net profit more than doubled to ₹5,520 crore, from ₹2,527 crore in the year-earlier period. The 118% jump in profit was on account of exceptional gains from the disinvestment of the electrical and automation business during the quarter.

Excluding the exceptional item, profit was ₹1,410 crore, a 45% decline from ₹2,552 crore in the year-earlier quarter.

“PAT was impacted mainly due to the lower revenue, higher credit provisions in the financial services business and disruption of the Metro services,” L&T said in a regulatory filing.

Consolidated revenue slid 12% to ₹31,035 crore.

The company has declared a special dividend of ₹18 per equity share “to mark the successful completion of the divestment”.

International revenues during the quarter at ₹12,148 crore constituted 39% of the total revenue, it said.

The company bagged orders worth ₹ 28,039 crore at the Group level during the quarter, down 42%, on account of deferment of award decisions largely caused by the pandemic, it said.

International orders during the quarter constituted 36% of the total order inflow.

The consolidated order book of the Group stood at ₹ 298,856 crore with international order book constituting 24% of the total order book

Exceptional items during the quarter comprises of impairment of funded exposure in the heavy forgings facility joint venture and impairment of assets in the power development business, it said.

Commenting on the result, R. Shankar Raman, Group Chief Financial Officer, L&T said, “The turnaround is still in progress and order book has been stable. As compared to the previous quarter we have seen some recovery and most of the new orders came from the infrastructure sector, mostly from the government.”

He said the government was active in placing orders in the areas of water supply, power transmission, metros, railways, roads and express ways. However the company’s power generation and hydrocarbon businesses remained impacted.

During the quarter, the company achieved the completion of divestment of its Electrical & Automation business to Schneider Electric (SE), France, and transferred the business to Schneider on receipt of consideration on August 31, 2020.

Net profit after tax from discontinued operations for the quarter comprised profits of Electrical & Automation (E&A) business till the date of divestment to Schneider Electric (SE) on August 31, 2020 amounting to ₹ 45 crore and gain of ₹ 8,101 crore (net of tax) on conclusion of divestment of the business.

“The gain has been computed based on consideration accrued as per the terms of the respective agreements and is subject to post transaction closing adjustments in subsequent quarters,” the company said.

On the outlook, the company said strong emphasis by the government on infrastructure spending would augur well for the company. “If the current moderation in new COVID-19 cases is sustained, and with increased efforts for launch of effective vaccines, recovery could gather pace and yield a possible GDP upgrade over the next year or two,” it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/kybqd2/article32966398.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29BULampT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lt-q2-net-jumps-118-to-5520-cr-on-divestment/article32966399.ece
50,2020/10/28,‘Financial conditions better now’,"Ratings agency credits RBI for mitigation

India’s financial situation has improved from the lows of COVID-19 in April, as per Crisil’s Financial Conditions Index (FCI).

“[The] credit for this is due to the Reserve Bank of India, whose overtures to maintain easier financial conditions — in lockstep with central banks elsewhere — have helped mitigate the large and broad-based economic damage caused by the pandemic,” Crisil said in a report.

“While easy global monetary policies have helped, the RBI’s accommodative stance has helped contain short-run pressures no less,” it said.

However it said, pockets of stress remained as evident in weak bank credit growth, wider spreads on lower-rated corporate bonds, and fundamental pressures due to high government borrowing.

On the necessity to construct the new index, Crisil said CRISIL said, “We believe the financial markets are an economy’s critical plumbing system, through which funds flow to those in need. They become all the more important during economic crises, when incomes and cash flows are disrupted for businesses and households.”

“Today, with the pandemic sparking off one of the biggest recessions, the functioning of the financial sector becomes critical – not only for its role of supporting borrowers, but also for policy implementation,” it added.

To arrive at India’s financial condition the Crisil team looked at movements in key parameters across various financial markets in India, including equity, debt, money and forex markets.

They also took into account financing conditions for the broader economy by including variables such as bank credit growth, lending rates, and money supply.

“Then, we aggregated these variables into an index – the FCI – that can be used to track the state of financial conditions over time. We believe this summary variable can be used to track the state of financial conditions over time,” Crisil said.

This can be used as an input in understanding the state of the economy, the impact of policy and, eventually, for assessing the future path of the economy, it added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/financial-conditions-better-now/article32965358.ece

57,2020/10/28,"Nearly 20% of rural school children had no textbooks due to COVID-19 impact, finds ASER survey","In the week of the survey in September, about one in three rural children had done no learning activity at all.

About 20% of rural children have no textbooks at home, according to the Annual State of Education Report (ASER) survey conducted in September, the sixth month of school closures due to COVID-19 across the country. In Andhra Pradesh, less than 35% of children had textbooks, and only 60% had textbooks in Rajasthan. More than 98% had textbooks in West Bengal, Nagaland and Assam.

In the week of the survey, about one in three rural children had done no learning activity at all. About two in three had no learning materials or activity given by their school that week, and only one in ten had access to live online classes. It’s not always about technology; in fact, levels of smartphone ownership have almost doubled from 2018, but a third of children with smartphone access still did not receive any learning materials.

Although the Centre has now permitted States to start reopening schools if they can follow COVID-19 safety protocols, the vast majority of the country’s 25 crore students are still at home after seven straight months. The ASER survey provides a glimpse into the levels of learning loss that students in rural India are suffering, with varying levels of access to technology, school and family resources resulting in a digital divide in education.

ASER is a nationwide survey of rural education and learning outcomes in terms of reading and arithmetic skills that has been conducted by the NGO Pratham for the last 15 years. This year, the survey was conducted via phone calls, reaching 52,227 rural households with school age children in 30 States and Union Territories.

It found that 5.3% of rural children aged 6-10 years had not yet enrolled in school this year, in comparison to just 1.8% in 2018. This seems to indicate that due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic, families are waiting for the physical opening of schools to enrol their youngest children, with about 10% of six-year-olds not in school. Among 15-16-year-olds, however, enrolment levels are actually slightly higher than in 2018. Enrolment patterns also show a slight shift toward government schools, with private schools seeing a drop in enrolment in all age groups.

In 2018, ASER surveyors found that about 36% of rural households with school-going children had smartphones. By 2020, that figure had spiked to 62%. About 11% of families bought a new phone after the lockdown, of which 80% were smartphones.

Also Read | Online learning out of reach for many

This may indicate why WhatsApp was by far the most popular mode of transmitting learning materials to students, with 75% of students who got some input receiving it via the messaging app. About a quarter of those who got input had personal contact with a teacher.

However, two thirds of rural children nationwide reported that they had not received any learning materials or activities at all. In Bihar, less than 8% got such materials from their schools, along with 20% in West Bengal, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. On the other hand, more than 80% of rural children in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Kerala and Gujarat received such input.

Many children did learning activities on their own, with or without regular input. Of the 70% who did some activities, 11% had access to live online classes, and 21% had videos or recorded classes, with much higher levels in private schools. About 60% studied from their textbooks, and 20% watched classes broadcast on TV. In Andhra Pradesh, half of all children did no learning activity at all, while in Kerala, only 5% of children were left out.

Parental levels of education and resources played a key role in whether children studied at home. About 20% of children whose parents had less than five years of education got learning materials, compared to 46% among parents who had studied beyond Class IX themselves. Almost 40% in low education households got no materials and did no learning, compared to 17% of high education families. However, almost 40% of low education families persevered and did some learning activities even without receiving any learning materials at all, the survey found.

“When schools re-open, it will be important to continue to monitor who goes back to school, and very importantly to understand whether there is learning loss as compared to previous years,” said ASER. Noting that 80% of families provided learning support to children, whether from parents or elder siblings, ASER recommended that schools find ways to build on that home support going forward.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hclxxn/article32966298.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RURALCHILDRENTEXTBOOK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-20-of-rural-school-children-had-no-textbooks-due-to-covid-19-impact-finds-aser-survey/article32966299.ece

“The interlocking of the communications and electronic systems are going to adversely affect the integrity and independent decision making of the Indian defence structure.

They dismissed the justification that the emerging alliance with the U.S. is needed in the light of the recent tensions with China at the Ladakh border, pointing out that the agreements were in the pipeline even before the stand-off.

“The emerging military alliance with the U.S. will have long term consequences for independent foreign policy and strategic autonomy.

“We strongly deplore the personal attacks in unacceptable language on President Emmanuel Macron in violation of the most basic standards of international discourse. We also condemn the brutal terrorist attack that took the life of a French school teacher in a gruesome manner that has shocked the world. We offer our condolences to his family and the people of France,” said the Ministry of External Affairs.

The French government has come under intense criticism in the Arab world and in Pakistan after the development. This has been accompanied by strong social media reaction against President Macron in various Muslim-majority societies.

Prime Minister Imran Khan repeatedly raised the issue in his public speeches in the last few days. On Wednesday, he wrote to leaders of Muslim states to “act collectively to counter the growing Islamophobia in non-Muslim states”.

60,2020/10/28,Aarogya Setu app | IT Ministry says taking steps to comply with CIC orders,"Central Information Commission serves show cause notice to Centre.

Following a show cause notice issued over the government’s “preposterous” response to an RTI (Right to Information) query related to the Aarogya Setu application, the IT Ministry said it was taking steps to comply with the CIC’s orders, while adding that the app had been developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) in collaboration with volunteers from industry and academia.

“As per the orders of the CIC, Central Public Information Officers (CPIOs) of Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY), National E-Governance Division (NeGD) and NIC have been directed to appear on November 24, 2020. MeitY is taking necessary steps to comply with the orders of the CIC,” the IT Ministry said in a statement.

The statement comes after the Ministry and NIC were slammed by the CIC over their reply to an RTI stating that they do not have any information about the “creation” of the Aarogya Setu application promoted by the government to contain the spread of COVID-19. The CIC termed the response as “preposterous” and issued a show cause notice to the NIC to explain why a penalty under the RTI Act should not be slapped on it for “prima facie obstruction of information and providing an evasive reply”.

In the order, Information Commissioner Vanaja N. Sarna pointed out that the website of the application mentions that the content on it is “owned, updated and maintained” by MyGov and MeitY, and directed the CPIO of the Ministry to explain why they did not have the requisite information.

“With regard to the above, it is clarified that there should be no doubt with regard to the Aarogya Setu App and its role in helping contain COVID19 Pandemic in India,” MeitY said in a release, adding that, as was announced on April 2, 2020, the Aarogya Setu App had been launched by the Government of India in a public private partnership mode to bring the people of India together in its fight against COVID-19.

“The names of all those associated with the development of the App and management of the App ecosystem at various stages was shared when the code was released in Open/Public Domain and the same was shared widely in media also...On all such occasions, it has been clearly mentioned that the Aarogya Setu App has been developed by NIC in collaboration with volunteers from Industry and Academia,” it added.

It said that the app had been developed in the most transparent manner, and all details and documents, including the “Privacy Policy” and the “Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocols” issued on May 11, 2020 had been uploaded on the Aarogya Setu portal.

The App, as per the government, has been downloaded by more than 16.23 crore users, has helped identify Bluetooth contacts of COVID-19 positive users, and in issuing alerts for helping people to stay safe. “Among those who have been advised testing, almost 25% have tested positive. This is much higher compared to the overall positivity rate of 7-8%. Thus, the efficiency of testing has gone up with Aarogya Setu. In addition, Aarogya Setu ITIHAS interface with location data has helped identify emerging hotspots where proactive steps have been taken by Health authorities and administration in order to contain the spread of the Virus,” it added.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday against the Nainital High Court order for CBI probe into the allegations of corruption levelled against him by a journalist.

The high court verdict came on two separate petitions filed by two journalists - Umesh Sharma and Shiv Prasad Semwal -- seeking quashing of FIR lodged against them in July this year under various provisions of the IPC.

While quashing the FIR, the high court ordered CBI probe into the allegations levelled against the Chief Minister Rawat.

64,2020/10/28,"Onions: Constant price fluctuation matter of grave concern, says Sharad Pawar","Centre’s decision to halt exports while continuing with its imports is ‘illogical’, says ex-Union Agriculture Minister.

Dubbing the Centre’s decision to halt onion exports while continuing with its imports ‘illogical’, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday urged the Narendra Modi government to pay more attention to the onion problem. The constant fluctuation in the prices, which had acutely hit the farmers in Nashik and elsewhere, was a matter of grave concern, he said.

Mr. Pawar was speaking in Nashik where he held an important meeting with onion cultivators and traders to mediate in the crisis that has arisen after auctions were suspended at the agriculture market produce committees (APMCs) earlier this week in protest against the Centre’s imposition of a stock limit.

As a result, traders in Nashik have been refusing to buy onions from farmers, with 15 APMCs and four sub-committees in the district, which is one of India’s most important onion-producing hubs, remaining shut on Monday.

The former Union Agriculture Minister told farmers that one must not expect too much from the State government as all decisions relating to import and export of onions were taken at the national level.

“Do not expect too much from the State government as the Centre takes all decisions regarding the import and export of onions. The State government has nothing to do with the action taken against the traders,” Mr. Pawar said.

Stating that Nashik ranked first in the country in terms of the quantity and quality of its onions, Mr. Pawar assured farmers and traders that he, along with two farmer and trader representatives, would soon be holding talks with the Central government on stock limits.

“Frequent fluctuations are a matter of grave concern which the Centre needs to pay urgent attention to…I appeal to all traders to start onion auctions instead of keeping the market shut in protest,” he said.

To check the soaring prices and provide relief to consumers, the Centre had last week imposed a stock holding limit on retail and wholesale traders till December 31.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/99r3po/article32963609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHARADPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/onions-constant-price-fluctuation-matter-of-grave-concern-says-sharad-pawar/article32963610.ece

Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) president Ghulam Ahmad Mir on October 28 said his party rejects the new land laws notified by the Centre for the Union Territory.

“The new land law is another gift of BJP to people of J&K. The Congress party rejects the new land laws and vows to fight for protection of rights,” Mr. Mir said addressing a public gathering in Gurez area of Bandipora district.

The Centre had on October 27 cleared the decks for people from across the country to buy land in Jammu and Kashmir by amending several laws.

In a gazette notification, the Ministry of Home Affairs made several changes to the land laws, including one that allows use of agricultural land for setting up facilities of public purpose.

The most important amendment has been made in the Jammu and Kashmir Development Act that deals with disposal of land with the Centre omitting the phrase “permanent resident of the State” from Section 17 of the law.

Reacting to the notification, Mr. Mir said betrayal and politics of deceit was the hallmark of BJP, which was hell-bent upon snatching everything from the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh by amending and bringing in different laws.

The party leader said the Central government was least bothered about the aspirations of the people and “takes decisions, which were one sided, politically motivated and against the wishes of the people“.

He termed the new land laws as an assault on the rights of people saying Congress party would not accept such “anti-J&K decisions” by the Centre.

66,2020/10/28,"Munger firing: Is it a crime to worship Maa Durga, asks Congress","Party denies it is trying to politicise the issue in the midst of Bihar election

The Congress on Wednesday asked if it is a ‘crime’ to worship Maa Durga, referring to Monday night’s police firing in Munger that killed a 22-year-old youth and injured several others while they were on their way to immerse an idol of Goddess Durga.

The party, however, denied that it was trying to politicise the issue in the midst of the Bihar election and asserted that it would speak up for any community, caste or religion if they were ‘brutally’ targeted like the devotees of Maa Durga.

Since Tuesday, the Congress — which is part of the grand alliance in Bihar and kept its campaign focussed on issues like unemployment — has held three press conferences on the firing and dared Prime Minister Narendra Modi to dismiss the Nitish Kumar government for targeting the bhakts [devotees] of Maa Durga’.

“Prime Minister Modiji, if you have any wisdom left, then you should dismiss this government that fired upon the devotees of Maa Durga in such a cruel manner...If you don’t do so, then it will be proven that sanskar [tradition] and sanskriti [culture] are only a means to achieve power and not a matter of faith for the BJP, Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala told reporters at a joint press conference in Patna with Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Tejashwi Yadav on Wednesday.

While Mr. Yadav asked for a court-monitored probe and asked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, also State’s Home Minister, who allowed the Bihar police to be General Dyer [Reginald Dyer of Jallianwala Bagh notoriety], the Congress asked the BJP to explain its ‘silence’.

“Is it now a crime to do Durga Puja?” asked Rajya Sabha MP and senior spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi at another press briefing. “The devotees were being ‘chased like animals and treated like worms’,” he said.

Mr. Singhvi, however, vehemently denied that the party was trying to polarise by playing the ‘Hindu card’, something it often accuses its rival, the BJP, of resorting to during elections.

“Where is the politicisation in this? Maa Durga is a deity that unites us all. Was there a terrorist there [among the devotees] that you behave in such a barbaric manner? And when we question this, then we are asked about the ‘Hindu’ card. Yes sir, we are playing the humanity card,” Mr. Singhvi responded.

“It is the most cruel and despicable act and we will continue to raise our voice. And we will continue to raise the same voice if any other community, caste or religion has been attacked in this brutal fashion for worshipping the deity.”

The Congress spokesperson also sought to contrast how the Nitish Kumar government was “mercilessly beating up devotees” while the crime graph has soared 150% in his 15-year rule. Citing data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), he said crimes in Bihar had gone up from 1.07 lakh cases in 2005 to 2.69 lakh cases in 2019 and riots had increased by 40% during Mr. Kumar’s rule.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/ikuuk1/article32827256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CONGRESSPC-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/munger-firing-is-it-a-crime-to-worship-maa-durga-asks-congress/article32963511.ece
67,2020/10/28,Hong Kong bars Air India flights for fourth time,"Hong Kong has banned Air India flights from Mumbai till November 10 after a few passengers on its flight earlier this week tested positive for COVID-19 post arrival, a senior government official said on Wednesday.

This is the fourth time that Air India flights from India have been banned by the Hong Kong government for bringing passengers who tested positive for the infection after arrival.

Previous bans were on the airline’s Delhi-Hong Kong flights during September 20-October 3 and August 18-August 31 and October 17-October 30.

Passengers from India can arrive in Hong Kong only if they have a COVID-19 negative certificate from a test done within 72 hours prior to the journey, according to rules issued by the Hong Kong government in July.

Moreover, all international passengers are required to undergo a post-flight COVID-19 test at the Hong Kong airport.

Besides India, a pre-flight COVID-19 negative certificate is mandatory for all passengers from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, France, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa, the UK and the US, according to the Hong Kong government’s rules.

An airline operating a flight to Hong Kong from these countries has to submit a form before departure, stating that all passengers onboard have COVID-19 negative certificates.

“A few passengers who travelled on Air India’s Mumbai-Hong Kong flight earlier this week tested positive for COVID-19 post arrival at Hong Kong,” the senior government official said.

“Subsequently, the Mumbai-Hong Kong flights have been barred from October 28 to November 10 by the Hong Kong government,” the official added.

Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 due to the pandemic.

However, the Indian airlines have been permitted to operate special international flights under the Vande Bharat Mission since May this year and under the bilateral air bubble pacts since July this year.

Under a bilateral air bubble pact, the airlines of both countries can operate international flights with certain restrictions.

With several rounds of military and diplomatic talks failing to make any headway for disengagement and de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control (LoC), both sides have prepared to be deployed in the high altitudes though the harsh winter.

Mr. Singh said the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) and the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) was a “momentous decision”.

69,2020/10/28,"Sunni Waqf Board seeks implementation of Place of Worship Act amid calls to reclaim Kashi, Mathura","“We are working on war footing to kick start the construction of the mosque and other facilities in Ayodhya.”

Expressing concern over Kashi and Mathura temples being dragged into legal dispute a year after the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict, the Sunni Central Waqf Board has sought strict implementation of the Places of Worship Act.

The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 provides for maintaining the “religious character” of holy structures as it existed on August 15, 1947.

A plea filed by a Hindu organisation in June had challenged Section 4 of the law in a bid to open the litigation route to reclaim disputed religious sites other than the Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya.

The Vishwa Bhadra Pujari Purohit Mahasangh’s plea assumes significance in the case of Kashi and Mathura where two disputed mosques stand.

Talking to PTI, chairman of Sunni Central Waqf Board, Zufar Farooqui, said, “The Places of Worship Act clearly prohibits the conversion of any place of worship and maintain its religious character as it existed on 15 August, 1947.”

“The Supreme Court’s verdict which had cleared the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya where the demolished Babri Masjid once stood has also reiterated the places of worship act,” he added.

Also read: Not for 'liberation' of Kashi, Mathura temples: RSS

“The board will be dealing with the court cases but since the places of worship act in place, it must be implemented to stop such attacks on mosques in India,” he said. After a protracted legal tussle, the Supreme Court, on November 9 last year, ruled in favour of the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh. Farooqui, who is also the president of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), a trust, for the construction of the mosque in Ayodhya, said the new structure will be bigger than the Babri masjid.

A museum, hospital and research centre which will also be built inside the complex.

“We are working on war footing to kick start the construction of the mosque and other facilities in Ayodhya. We are taking the advice of International experts to construct a world-class facility,” he said.

“The hospital of course will hold centre stage as it will serve humanity in the true spirit of Islam as taught by the prophet. It will be in sync with the architecture of the mosque, replete with calligraphy and Islamic symbols. It will house a 300-bed speciality unit, where doctors will work with missionary zeal to provide free treatment to the ailing,” he added.

The master plan will be designed to house an archive, museum and community kitchen in the mosque complex.

The archive and museum will exhibit contribution of Muslims to nation building, Indian culture and freedom struggle and of course Sufi saints who spread love and harmony, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ivkfna/article32962261.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MATHURATEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sunni-waqf-board-seeks-implementation-of-place-of-worship-act-amid-calls-to-reclaim-kashi-mathura/article32962262.ece
70,2020/10/28,Parliamentary panel asks Twitter for affidavit on geo-tagging glitch,"Representatives of Amazon too appeared before the Joint Parliamentary Committee.

The Joint Committee of Parliament on the Data Protection Bill sought an affidavit from Twitter Inc, the U.S.-based parent company of the social media platform, asking them to explain why it had shown Ladakh as a part of China, a senior member of the panel said on Wednesday.

The decision to seek an affidavit from the parent company was taken after the panel found the explanations offered by Twitter India representatives, who appeared before the Committee on Wednesday, to be “unsatisfactory and inadequate”.

Representatives of the e-commerce giant, Amazon, too appeared before the Committee on Wednesday, after the Parliamentary panel had mulled action against them last week for refusing to do so.

Appearing before the panel headed by Bharatiya Janata Party MP Meenakshi Lekhi, representatives of Twitter India “apologised” and claimed it to be a “mistake” as the app’s geo-tagging had suffered a technical glitch.

“The Committee was of the unanimous opinion that Twitter’s explanation on showing Ladakh as a part of China was inadequate,” Ms. Lekhi told PTI after the meeting.

Also read | India warns Twitter over map misrepresentation

She said Twitter representatives told the panel that the social media company “respects the sensitivities of India”.

“But it is not only a question of the sensitivity of India or Indians. It is a question about national integrity and sovereignty of the country, and not respecting that is a criminal offence. And displaying Indian map improperly and incorrectly is an offence of treason and attracts imprisonment of seven years,” Ms. Lekhi said.

The panel that questioned Twitter India’s executives for over two hours on the issue of Ladakh, also asked about its “banning policy”.

“Shadow banning, banning policy — there is no clarity about it. Such actions are very subjective... Twitter is becoming a law unto itself and, under these circumstances, they are violating Article 19 of the Constitution about the freedom of expression,” Ms. Lekhi said.

Some members also asked the social media company about its policy regarding fake news, paid news, its transparency policy, and the social media platform’s actions during elections, especially vis-a-vis their policies in other countries.

“The recent geo-tagging issue was swiftly resolved by our teams. We are committed to openness, transparency around our work and will remain in regular touch with the Government to share timely updates,” a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement.

Twitter faced a backlash from social media users after its geo-tagging feature recently displayed “Jammu & Kashmir, the People’s Republic of China” in a live broadcast from a war memorial in Leh, Ladakh.

A senior member told The Hindu that Twitter India was seen as a “marketing arm” of the parent company and, therefore, a written explanation has been sought from Twitter Inc. Some members noted that Twitter Asia, based in Singapore, mainly deals with advertisement revenues and takes all major decisions related to the region.

The Twitter India team that deposed before the panel included Shagufta Kamran, senior manager, public policy; Ayushi Kapoor, legal counsel; Pallavi Walia for policy communications, and Manvinder Bali, corporate security.

Officials from the Law Ministry as well as the Ministry of Electronics, Information and Technology (MeitY) also appeared before the panel.

On October 22, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Ajay Sawhney, had written to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to respect the country’s sensitivities, and is learnt to have made it clear that “any disrespect to sovereignty and territorial integrity is unacceptable”.

Separately, the panel also questioned India officials of e-commerce giant Amazon, and Amazon web services on different aspects of data security, and is learnt to have asked for written submissions.

Last week, the panel mulled over action against the e-commerce giant after Amazon expressed its inability to depose before the panel, as “domain experts” were based in the U.S. and they could not travel during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Next week, the Committee has summoned telecom operators Reliance Jio and Airtel, and cab aggregators Ola and Uber to depose before it on the issue of data security.

71,2020/10/28,ED attaches 21 immovable assets in bank fraud case,"They are located in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached 21 immovable properties in connection with a bank fraud case involving PBR Poultry Tech and others.

The properties worth ₹7.57 crore on paper were held in the name of accused Polepalli Venkata Prasand and his family members. The attachment order also includes deposits of ₹50 lakh with the Meliora Asset Reconstruction Company.

The attached immovable assets are located in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh.

The ED initiated the money laundering probe based on an FIR registered by the CBI against Mr. Prasad, then managing partner of PBR Poultry Tech, and other partners. It is alleged that they cheated Indian Overseas Bank of ₹ 7.34 crore.

PBR Poultry Tech had taken a term loan of ₹5.60 crore from the bank by grossly inflating the value of the mortgaged properties in collusion with panel advocates, as alleged.

The ED alleges that Mr. Prasad also got ₹1.74 crore in Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro & Small Enterprises loans, in the name of his associates.

The loan amounts were diverted by the accused persons and not repaid to the bank.

When the accused could not get more loan, they set up another shell entity, PBR Agritech Private Limited, for the purpose. They secured a term loan of ₹6.73 crore and cash credit of ₹3.2 crore in the shell company’s name from Andhra Bank.

Value of assets again inflated

According to the ED, the value of the mortgaged assets were again inflated.

“These loans were taken on the pretext of construction of a poultry shed, but instead the money was siphoned off and diverted to the main accused, who used it to introduce share capital and machinery in PBR Poultry Tech”, said an official.

The Andhra Bank loan has also become a non-performing asset.

The accused are trying to use the concealed proceeds of crime to buy back their mortgaged properties at lower rates by doing private deals with the asset reconstruction firm, said the ED.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nbqt5n/article32962157.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDEXNEWCURRENCY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-attaches-21-immovable-assets-in-bank-fraud-case/article32962146.ece
72,2020/10/28,DGCA extends suspension of scheduled international passenger flights till Nov 30,"India has formed air bubble pacts with around 18 countries.

The suspension of scheduled international passenger flights has been extended till November 30 amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said on Wednesday.

“However, the international scheduled flights may be allowed on selected routes by the competent authority on a case-to-case basis,” the Indian aviation regulator said in a circular.

The scheduled international passenger services have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic. But special international flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission since May and under the bilateral ‘air bubble’ arrangements with selected countries since July.

India has formed air bubble pacts with around 18 countries, including the US, the UK, the UAE, Kenya, Bhutan and France. Under an air bubble pact between two countries, special international flights can be operated by their airlines between their territories.

73,2020/10/28,SC rejects Delhi government’s plea against bail to Pinjra Tod activist,"Court rejects contention that Kalita will influence witnesses

The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected an appeal by the Delhi government against the grant of bail to Pinjra Tod activist Devangana Kalita in a case connected to the riots that rocked north-east Delhi in February.

A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan dismissed the government’s plea that Ms. Kalita was an “influential person”. The court said bail could not be denied merely because a person had influence. The court questioned the apprehensions raised by the government that Ms. Kalita would tamper with the witnesses.

The High Court had granted her bail saying the witnesses in the case were mostly police officers. The court, in its bail order on September 1, concluded that the police had shown no evidence to back their claim that Ms. Kalita instigated communal violence or hate speech. It said she was engaged in a peaceful protest, which was her fundamental right.

Ms. Kalita and her colleague, Natasha Narwal, were arrested in May and booked for rioting, unlawful assembly and attempt to murder. They were charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for allegedly being part of a “premeditated conspiracy.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/but1ck/article32922040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THSC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-dismisses-aap-govts-plea-against-bail-granted-to-pinjra-tod-activist-in-ne-delhi-violence-case/article32961999.ece

An NIA spokesman said the 10 searches took place in Srinagar and Bandipora, and at Thanisandra in Bengaluru.

“These searches were made in connection with a case pertaining to certain so-called non-governmental organisations [NGOs] and Trusts raising funds in India and abroad in the name of charitable activities and then using those funds for carrying out secessionist and separatist activities in J&K”, the spokesman said.

Fresh case

On October 8, the NIA registered a fresh case under Section 120B, 124 A of the IPC and Sections 17, 18, 22A, 22C, 38, 39 and 40 of the UA(P)A, 1967 “on receipt of credible information that certain NGOs and Trusts are collecting funds through so-called donations and business contributions etc. and are utilizing these funds for secessionist and terrorist activities in J&K”.

Mehbooba condemns searches

Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president and ex-Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti condemned the searches. “The NIA raids on human rights activist Parvez and the Greater Kashmir office in Srinagar is yet another example of the Government of India’s vicious crackdown on freedom of expression and dissent. Sadly, the NIA has become BJP’s pet agency to intimidate and browbeat those who refuse to fall in line,” she tweeted.

The Kashmir Editors Guild (KEG) has expressed concern over the pre-dawn NIA searches at the Greater Kashmir premises.

The Congress on Tuesday welcomed the Supreme Court decision to ask the Allahabad High Court to monitor the probe in the Hathras murder and alleged gang rape case.

Taking to Twitter, party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is the Congress in-charge for Uttar Pradesh, said the victim’s family had wanted court monitoring from day one, and the top court’s order had strengthened hopes for justice.

“The Supreme Court’s decision strengthens the hopes of justice. The victim’s family had been demanding a court monitored [case] from day one,” Ms. Vadra tweeted.

The Congress leader, who along with former party chief Rahul Gandhi, made a high profile visit to meet the Hathras victim’s family earlier this month, slammed the Uttar Pradesh government for the “atrocious” treatment of the victim’s family.

“Hathras’ victim, her family were meted out atrocious behaviour. There was character assassination. Decisions were taken with malice and prejudice,” she posted.

Stepping up its attack on the Yogi Adityanath government, the Congress has been demanding a judicial inquiry into the entire Hathras case, including the role of government authorities in dealing with the case.

77,2020/10/28,Supreme Court rejects plea to enforce new farm laws,"Plea wanted ban on protests, processions against the laws

The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea to enforce the controversial new agriculture laws.

The plea wanted a ban on protests and processions against the laws. It sought the framing of rules and guidelines to bar agitations in this regard. It even asked for a blanket bar on the dissemination of “propaganda” on social media against the parliamentary legislation.

The petitioner said the laws were enacted to serve the farmers' needs through an agrarian crisis.

“You cannot ask for a general direction to implement the Act... You have to bring forth specific cases,” Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, heading a three-judge Bench, addressed lawyers representing petitioner, Hindu Dharma Parishad.

On October 12, the court had sought the government’s response on several other petitions challenging the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Agriculture and Promotion) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act of 2020. These petitions had translated the enactment of the new laws as a means to usher in an “anti-farmer exploitative regime”.

78,2020/10/28,Tense situation continues in Kuppam,"YSRCP, TDP cadres still on collision course in the Assembly segment

The four mandals of Kuppam, Ramakuppam, Gudupalle, and Shantipuram in the Kuppam Assembly constituency, represented by Telugu Desam Party national president N. Chandrababu Naidu, continues to be tense for the third consecutive day, following promulgation of Section-144 after the TDP and YSR Congress Party cadres resorted to ‘maha padayatras’ and courter agitations over local issues.

The TDP cadres earlier planned a five-day ‘maha padayatra’ from Ramakuppam to Kuppam on October 26, demanding completion of the Handri Neeva Sujala Sravanti (HNSS) Kuppam branch canal works. As a counter, the YSRCP cadres planned counter walkathon from the same venue and at the same time, alleging that the TDP leadership had scuttled the housing scheme programme of the State government by taking the matter to the court.

A police officer said that in order to prevent clashes between the two sides, the promulgation of Section 144 was necessitated in the constituency. He said that the cadres of the ruling party were also asked to withdraw their move of counter agitations. “At present, both sides are not ready to give up their proposed protests. We are all prepared to protect law and order here,” he said.

Demoralised cadre

It was observed that after the TDP chief won the Kuppam Assembly seat with a highly reduced majority at 30,000 votes, about 40% less than the 2014 election, it had demoralised cadres. A senior TDP leader in Kuppam said that the HNSS Kuppam branch canal should have been completed during the five-year regime of the TDP post bifurcation.

Meanwhile, YSRCP strongman and Panchayat Raj Minister Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy is said to be keen on strengthening the party cadres in Mr. Naidu’s bastion and to further weaken by the next elections. The prolonged absence of Mr. Naidu in Kuppam during the last one year also came as a setback to the party.

79,2020/10/28,Gang creating fake Aadhaar cards busted,"Printers, cell phones, computers and other electronic gadgets recovered

A 30-member gang creating fake Aadhaar cards was busted by the Kurnool district police on Wednesday. The members, taking advantage of the data changing provisions in UIDAI, allegedly registered thousands of people under various government welfare schemes like Jagananna Cheyutha, YSR Pension Scheme, Nethanna Nestam and Aasara, earning easy money.

Superintendent of Police Fakkeerappa Kaginelli said at a press conference here the modus operandi followed by the gang was to create a fake PAN card for a person first by photoshopping data in it and use the fake card as a genuine document for altering the data in the Aadhaar card. Aadhaar card is the basis for sanctioning benefits under various welfare schemes.

Following complaints about fraudulent withdrawal of money through such dubious means of obtaining fake proofs, the police raided four places in the district and busted the gang. Cell phones, printers, computers, and other electronic gadgets were recovered from the gang members.

The gang used to collect ₹5,000 to ₹6,000 per fake document and get customers through agents. A similar fraud had come to light in other districts too.

Raids conducted

Raids were conducted on 10 Village Secretariats and 200 applications were found to be from fraudulent beneficiaries. Some persons, aged 45 years, got Aadhar cards showing the age of 60 years and had applied for pension. The investigation was in the preliminary stage, said the SP.

In Pathikonda, 14 persons were arrested. Eight persons were arrested in the past in a similar case. Two persons were taken into custody in Nandavaram, 10 from Adoni, six from Banaganapalli.

Representatives of 11 political parties expressed their views on the conduct of local body elections in an all - party meeting organised by the State Election Commission (SEC) here on Wednesday.

The meeting was presided by commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar, who said in a press release that he desired to maintain a close and regular interface with the Health Department to keep track of the dynamics of COVID-19 scenario.

While the TDP, BJP and Congress conveyed their stand on the elections through K. Atchannaidu (TDP State president), Paka Satyanarayana and Shaik. Masthanvali respectively, YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) stayed away from the deliberations on the pretext that the SEC embarked on the opinion gathering exercise without first consulting the government.

The BJP's ally Jana Sena Party (JSP) communicated it's opinion in writing.

It may be recalled that Mr. Ramesh Kumar had postponed the elections in March this year due to the prevalence of COVID-19, which had since snowballed into a major controversy as the government removed from the post of commissioner through an ordinance and subsequently reinstated him following a bitter legal battle that went up to the Supreme Court.

About Wednesday's meeting, Mr. Ramesh Kumar stated that invitations were sent to 19 parties, of which 11 sent their leaders and two conveyed their views in writing. Six parties have neither deputed their leaders nor let their opinions known.

Deliberations were held with principal secretary (health, medical and family welfare) A.K. Singhal and commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar on October 27.

Mr. Ramesh Kumar further said that the commission attached great sanctity to the process of consultations as per the practices of the Election Commission of India.

Accordingly, invitations to take part in the discussions were sent to 19 parties including six recognised national parties, three recognised state parties in AP, nine recognised state parties in other States registered with the SEC and one recognised party with reserved symbol.

“The SEC is a Constitutional body and casting aspersions on it is best avoided as per the best democratic traditions.

81,2020/10/28,Kidnapped Hyderabad dentist rescued by Anantapur police,"A ransom of ₹10 crore was demanded in bitcoins.

Anantapur police on Wednesday morning rescued Hyderabad-based dentist Dr. Behjath Hussain, after he was kidnapped from his yet-to-be inaugurated clinic on Tuesday afternoon.

He was being shifted to Udupi in an inhuman condition in an SUV. The police could nab only one kidnapper, Sanjay (25) while three others fled in the cover of darkness.

The dentist, who is also a realtor, was kidnapped for a ransom of Rs. 10 crore in bitcoins. When rescued, Dr. Hussain’s nails were cut and injuries were found on his face and head, the Rapthadu police told The Hindu.

Also Read Mastermind in dentist kidnap was bankrupt in Australia

He was given first-aid and handed over to a team of Cyberabad police, which reached Anantapur by noon. Anantapur police informed their counterparts in Cyberabad at 6.30 a.m. about the doctor’s rescue. Totally 13 persons were involved in the kidnap and they used a vehicle of Maharashtra registration - MH 40 A 7128 to shift him from Hyderabad to Udupi.

Rapthadu Sub-Inspector P.T. Anjaneyulu along with his team checked all vehicles at Marur Toll Plaza since 2 a.m. and the kidnappers on coming to know about the presence of police turned towards Kanaganapalli at Dolphin Dhaba on National Highway no 44. After a hot chase for an hour from two different directions and taking assistance from the mobile location tracking system, the vehicle was intercepted at Bukkacherla village. Out of the four, three kidnappers fled under the cover of darkness, said the sub-inspector.

Wrapped in clothes, the kidnapper stuffed Dr. Hussain in the legroom. According to the victim, who is also a real-estate operator having Prestige Royal Woods Villas in Kismatpur, he was kidnapped by four unknown persons clad in burqas from his clinic and confined him to a room in an undisclosed place in Hyderabad.

The Marathi speaking kidnappers handed over the doctor to four others, who asked them to go either to Bengaluru or Shimoga in Karnataka. They started from Hyderabad past midnight. The Cyberabad police had alerted the Anantapur SP B. Satya Yesu Babu about the possible movement of the kidnappers on the National Highway based on their cell phone locations.

Later in the evening, Cyberabad Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar said that Dr. Hussain was abducted by his ‘close relative’ Mustafa, who is into the hospitality industry in Hyderabad and Pune.

He said that seven people in connection with the case were arrested, while five others including kingpins Mustafa and Mubashir Ahmed alias Khaled are still at large.

The arrested are Sumit Chandrakanth Bhosale (28), Akshay Balu Vairekar (24), Vicky Datta Shinde (20) from Pune, Mohd. Raheem (18) from Chandrayanagutta, Mohd. Imran (21), Mohd. Irfan (25) from Kukatpally and Sanjay (19) of Udupi.

“Mustafa became close to the victim’s family with a plea of getting a flat on rent for Mubhashir in the newly constructed building. Without anticipating the danger from the accused, Dr. Hussain gave a flat on rent to Mubashir at Bandlaguda,” Mr. Sajjanar said, adding that since then they were keeping a close on the movements of the dentist and were waiting for a ‘right time’ to execute their plan.

On Tuesday afternoon, four people clad in burqas barged into the clinic and hit the victim with a toy pistol. His assistant was locked in the washroom with hands tied and mouth gagged.

“They took him to Yellammabanda and sent a voice message to the family members demanding Rs. 10 crore in bitcoin,” the Commissioner said.

He said that 12 teams consisting over 100 police personnel were pressed into action to trace and rescue Dr. Hussain.

83,2020/10/28,Trimex company employees urge govt. to revive factory,"‘Govt. should run the unit to protect livelihood of people dependent on it’

As many as 550 employees and 2,000 daily wage workers who have lost their livelihood with the closure of Trimex Sands Private Limited have been urging the Union and State governments to take steps for its revival either in private or public sector.

The company engaged in exploration of heavy beach sand minerals stopped its operations following the countrywide ban on beach sand mining by private companies clamped in February 2019. The Union government issued orders saying that mining of heavy minerals such as ilmenite, rutile, garnet, monazite and zircon should be done by government agencies only.

The government’s order had come as a big jolt for the company, its staff and the 2500 village dwellers and others who depended on the economic activity generated by the company in and around Vatsavalasa village of Gara mandal in the district.

Welfare activities

As part of its CSR activity, the company reportedly spent nearly ₹20 crore for the establishment of an English medium school, a medical centre and water plants. Except the school, the other service activities have been stopped due to lack of funds.

“The government has ignored the fate of employees while banning mining by private companies. Either Union or State governments can take up the responsibility to ensure livelihood for the employees and others,” said N. Kumar, an employee of the company.

“AP Mineral Development Corporation can be given the responsibility since the Union government had clearly stated that the factories can by operated by government agencies,” said K. Raju, another employee.

People of Vatsavalasa, Tulugu, Tonangi, Srikurmam and other villages are eagerly waiting for the revival of the factory. “Trimex Sands Private Limited is a major industry in the Srikakulam constituency. Its closure led to denial of jobs to many youngsters of Gara and Srikakulam mandals. The government should take immediate steps for reopening of the factory,” said T.

87,2020/10/28,‘Village Protection Force’ launched in Guntur,"Youths will assist police in law and order and traffic duties

The Guntur Urban Police, in a novel initiative, have roped in local youths to form a Village Protection Force that will assist the police in maintaining law and order in villages.

The force comprises able-bodied youths who will voluntarily serve in the villages under the supervision of police officers. They will be trained in manning village borders, gathering information on newcomers and assist the police in traffic duties.

“The concept of a Village Protection Force has been initiated as we feel that a lot of issues can be solved amicably. We have selected youngsters after going through their credentials, and the service is purely voluntary. The ITC-ABD has provided T-shirts and caps to the volunteers as part of their CSR activity. Each team consists of 10 members who are trained to perform their duties,” said Superintendent of Police (Guntur Urban) R.N. Ammireddy.

The Village Protection Force (VPF) is expected to usher in better law and order in faction-ridden villages like Mutluru in Vatticherukuru mandal, which has witnessed sporadic clashes between the two dominant communities.

The concept of a village force itself has been in vogue since the times of the British and an informal system used to be in place to keep a check on criminal tribesmen and anti-social elements, the SP said.

In 1983, the village witnessed a series of murders which later escalated into a full-blown factional violence which was exploited by political parties.

“We have started this initiative as part of the Police Commemoration Week and we want it to extend to other mandals also. The VPF will be monitored by the local SHOs and the services are purely voluntary,” Mr. Ammireddy said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lm2kob/article32958592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28-VJ-GUNTURSP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/village-protection-force-launched-in-guntur/article32958593.ece

L.K.V. Ranga Rao, DIG, Visakhapatnam Range, explained the side effects of power and how power could corrupt and how corruption was systematically ingrained in government offices.

He said that the best way to combat corruption was to strengthen the system. He emphasised the importance of value system and inculcating the values of integrity in all spheres of life which would certainly help in reducing corruption.

92,2020/10/28,Union Minister responds positively to MP’s plea on ESI hospital,"Non-availability of land delays the project

Lavu Srikrishnadevaraylu , MP of Narasaraopet, on Tuesday urged Union Minister for Labour Santosh Gangwar to clear the construction of ESI Hospital in Chilakaluripet in Guntur district.

The MP said that a 100-bed ESI hospital was sanctioned for Guntur district, but the project did not take off because of non-availability of land. ESI beneficiaries and their dependent family members were suffering without adequate healthcare facilities. “This is now going to change as suitable land parcels have been identified in Chilakaluripet for the ESI hospital to come up.”

Apprising the Labour Ministry of newly identified land in Thimmapuram and Ganapavaram which was close to NH 5, the MP requested him for fast construction of the hospital. The Labour Minister took note of the land parcels identified and assured his complete support in the speedy construction of the hospital in Chilakaluripet for the benefit of Guntur district.

Subsidy for rice exporters

Earlier, the MP called on Railway Board Chairman regarding subsidies for rice exporters and sought for smooth transport of rice from interior regions of the State.

“Indian rice exporters have worked hard over the years to provide an international market for India's paddy farmers. Our farmers grow quality non-basmati rice which fetches more than ₹30,000 crore in exports annually,” said the MP.

Putting forward proposals to classify rice meant for exports at par with rice procured by FCI for fast movement and extending station to station facility to rice exporters, the MP said that exports would fetch good revenues for traders.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/union-minister-responds-positively-to-mps-plea-on-esi-hospital/article32958472.ece

94,2020/10/28,Drip irrigation: Anantapur likely to lose its distinction,"The district receives no funds yet under the project this year

Anantapur district, which used to be in the forefront in utilising the funds for drip irrigation and covering the large extent of land every year for the past three consecutive years in the country, might lose that distinction as the State government has not yet released funds for the purpose.

Even countrywide, Andhra Pradesh (7.17 lakh ha), which currently holds the second position after Karnataka (8.16 lakh ha) in covering largest area under micro irrigation, utilising the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) funds might go further down with Gujarat (7 lakh hectares) following A.P. For the 2020-21 financial year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare has provisioned ₹400 crore under the scheme for Andhra Pradesh.

No decision has been taken yet on the modalities of providing subsidy through the A.P. Micro Irrigation Project (APMIP) to 4,250 farmers, who have registered themselves to avail of the facility in 6,345 hectares. Close to ₹140 crore, last year’s due, is yet to be released to 37 companies, who had supplied the material. The APMIP Anantapur on its part has completed the field verification also for 1,345 applicants.

While making the tentative allocation under the ‘Per Drop More Crop Component’ of the PMKSY for the year 2020-21 (₹3,645.00 crore for the entire country), ₹400 crore has been apportioned for Andhra Pradesh and a decision has been taken to revalidate the unutilised funds of the previous year by providing the utilisation certificates.

Area covered under project

Andhra Pradesh had taken a loan of ₹616.14 crore through the NABARD against expenditure made during 2019-20. The area covered under the projects is 1.021 lakh ha in the State. Anantapur district APMIP covered 35,885 ha in the 2017-18 fiscal benefiting 30,535 farmers; 34,105 ha in 2018-19 (27,576 farmers) and 29,065 ha in 2019-20 (22,697 farmers), Project Director B. Subba Rayudu told The Hindu.

Through drip irrigation and sprinklers, currently in Anantapur district, 65,000 hectares of vegetable crops are irrigated followed by 52,000 ha of sweet lime, 28,000 ha of papaya, 22,200 ha of banana, 16,000 ha of melons, and another 16,000 ha of mango.

100,2020/10/28,Marked decline in COVID-19 deaths in Karnataka during October,"This is being attributed to high testing, early detection, and early treatment; massive tests carried out between September 1 and October 27

As the number of daily new positive cases and Test Positivity Rate (TPR) witnessed a marked dip in the State, a perceptible decline has also been noticed in the number of COVID-19 deaths during October in comparison to August and September.

While 3,388 and 3,162 people died of COVID-19 during August and September, respectively, the number had come down substantially during October. Till October 27, the total number of deaths during the month in the State was 2,127.

“We are almost towards the end of October and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 suggests that they are a good one-third less than the numbers recorded during the preceding months of August and September,” said Mysore Sanjeev, convener of Jeevan Raksha, an initiative by Proxima, a management consulting firm, with technical support and guidance of Public Health Foundation of India, which is studying COVID-19 trends in the country.

The steep decline in rate of mortality, however, had been preceded by weeks of increased testing and high case load, he pointed out. The period between September 1 and October 27 witnessed Karnataka carrying out a massive 46,18,387 tests or about 61% of its total 75,14,194 tests.

This also led to the State adding 57.5% of its total positive cases which went up by 4,67,215 from 3,42,423 cases on August 31 to 8,09,638 cases on October 27.

The number of deaths due to COVID-19 in Karnataka, which stood at 2,314 on July 31, went up to 10,991 on October 27. Out of the 8,677 deaths since August 1, August and September accounted for 3,388 and 3,162 deaths, respectively, while the October (till 27) saw 2,083 deaths.

Mr. Sanjeev said the substantial decline in number of deaths can be attributed to high testing, early detection, and early treatment. “This seems to be the result of ramping up testing from average 41,000 tests per day in September to 76,000 per day in October. This also reflects the improved quality of containment management,” he said.

However, he cautioned against allowing the Moving Growth Rate (MGR) of testing to drop. Instead, it should propel the testing in November to at least an average 1.5 lakh tests per day, he suggested.

“This will enable the State to identify the infected patients when the spread of virus is still mild, which will result in further reduction in monthly average number of deaths in coming months,” he said.

The decline in mortality in the State comes as the number of daily new COVID-19 cases in India falls from a high of 97,860 on September 16 to 36,838 on October 26 while in Karnataka, which was recording about 10,000 to 11,000 cases per day earlier this month, reported only 3,691 on October 27.

Munish Moudgil, who heads the State COVID-19 War Room, said that the number of new COVID-19 cases in Karnataka had come down due to high testing. He attributed the reduction in daily new cases and rate of positivity to be a natural consequence of high daily testing.

High daily testing, particularly RT-PCR testing, holds the key to identify, control and reduce COVID-19, he said in a statement while contending that the approach towards high daily testing should continue even when the daily new cases and the rate of positivity fall to prevent a second wave.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bzftkq/article32966724.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGCOVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/marked-decline-in-covid-19-deaths-in-state-during-oct/article32966731.ece

103,2020/10/28,Council polls: Pandemic doesn’t deter voters,"Average turnout of all four constituencies spread across 18 districts in the State stood at 72.3%

The first elections in the State amid COVID-19 pandemic, to four Legislative Council seats on Wednesday, recorded a turnout that was better than the previous elections, belying expectations. The average turnout of all four constituencies put together was 72.3%.

While average turnout in two graduates’ constituencies was 72.9%, teachers’ constituencies reported average polling of 70.26%. The four constituencies are spread across 18 districts in the State.

Elections were held to Karnataka West Graduates’ (KWG), Karnataka South East Graduates’ (KSEG), Karnataka North East Teachers’ (KNET), and Bangalore Teachers’ in which 40 contestants, including four members who had retired earlier, were in fray. The elections were necessitated after S.V. Sankanur, R. Chowda Reddy Thoppalli, Sharanappa Mattur, and Puttanna had retired on June 30 after finishing their term.

Highest and lowest

KSEG constituency recorded the highest turnout with 74.84% of the total 1.09 lakh voters turning up amidst several precautionary measures owing to the pandemic. In 2014, of the total 98,337 voters, 52.25% had voted.

The Bangalore Teachers’ constituency, which has the lowest number of voters in the polling list at 21,963, also reported the lowest among the four constituencies with 66.2% turnout. This in comparison to 2014 when 44.91% of the total 36,916 voters had participated in polling.

The KNET constituency reported 73.32%, of the total 29,236 voters exercising their franchise. In 2014, 60.3% of the 31,809 registered voters had polled in KNET. KWG, which had a total of 74,278 eligible voters, recorded polling of 70.11% as against 49.48% of 94,352 eligible persons voting in 2014.

Muted response

Earlier in the day, as the polling commenced at 8 a.m., the first two hours saw a muted response from the voters, but picked up after 10 a.m. By 2 p.m., the voting percentage had crossed 50% in both teachers’ constituency, while the graduates’ constituencies were inching closer to 50 %.

Patients vote

Owing to the pandemic, elaborate arrangements had been made at the polling stations, including setting up of isolation facilities for COVID-19 positive patients. In Dharwad district, two COVID-19 positive patients cast their votes wearing PPE kits at booth no. 50 in Annigeri. The administration had arranged transportation for them and the polling station was sanitised after they cast their votes. Besides Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi and former Minister Basavaraj Horatti were among the prominent voters.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ihcwq9/article32966537.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGCOUNCILPOLLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/council-polls-pandemic-doesnt-deter-voters/article32966538.ece
104,2020/10/28,Dasara brought no cheer to the Mysuru zoo,"Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, it attracted only 20,000 visitors in a span of 10 days this year compared to 1.65 lakh last year

The COVID-19 pandemic has left a lasting damage on the tourism industry and the footfall at the Mysuru zoo, the city’s most populardestination, during this year’s Dasara and during the festivities last year clearly illustrate it.

In 10 Dasara days last year, the zoo had managed to attract a whopping 1.65 lakh visitors. This year, the number stood at just 20,000, reckoned to be lowest in its recent history. This number is less than what the zoo had drawn on Vijayadashami last year which was 28,386.

Dasara is one of the biggest tourism seasons as far as Mysuru is concerned and the footfall continues even after the entire festive season is over. The tourists’ inflow continues almost till the end of the year after Dasara season, bringing revenue to lakhs of people dependent on the industry.

This year, the tourist sites are struggling to get visitors after the lockdown curbs were unlocked, threatening their survival, including that of Mysuru zoo whose revenue at one point of time turned zero.

If the statistics of the last four years were noticed, the number of visitors during 10 days of Dasara had been on the rise every year, increasing the income. Footfall is key for the zoo’s maintenance since it does not get any grant from the government. The gate collection is the only source of income for looking after the well-being of animals, feeding costs and staff salaries.

In 2017 Dasara, the zoo attracted 1.23 lakh visitors which increased to 1.53 lakh and further rose to 1.65 lakh in 2019 Dasara.

Last year, ₹1.59 crore revenue was earned in a span of 10 days. It was ₹1.05 crore in 2018 and ₹69.17 lakh in 2017. But this year, the revenue earned was only ₹19.56 lakh in 10 days, considered the lowest in recent history.

Post-COVID-19, the zoo had managed to get between 2,000 and 3000 visitors on weekends and around 1,500 visitors on weekdays since last month. The highest single-day visitors to the zoo since the pandemic this year was 7,264 which was achieved on Vijayadashami. On the day of Ayudha Puja this year, 3,534 people visited the zoo. The single-day revenue on Vijayadashami Day this year was ₹7.33 lakh and ₹3.05 lakh on the day of Ayudha Puja, said Zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni.

There were times when the zoo could earn ₹30 lakh in a single day in the form of gate collection. But, the pandemic devastated the tourism sector and the stakeholders continue to suffer losses, hoping for revival, if not this year, at least from next year, assuming the vaccine arrives early next year.

The number of visitors on Ayudha Puja day in the last four years is: 15,499 in 2017; 22,398 in 2018; 30,273 in 2019; and 3,534 in 2020. On Vijayadashami day, the footfall was 31,722 in 2017, 32,301 in 2018, 28,386 in 2019 and 7,264 in 2020. Last year, the zoo earned ₹29.77 lakh from gate collection on the day of Ayudha Puja and ₹28.28 lakh on the day of Vijayadashami.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/49hi9f/article32966431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28MYSZOO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dasara-brought-no-cheer-to-the-mysuru-zoo/article32966358.ece
105,2020/10/28,Elephant Abhimanyu and team head back to jungle camps,"The 5 elephants including Abhimanyu that took part in Mysuru Dasara were accorded a warm send-off from the city to their respective jungle camps on Wednesday.

Though 12 elephants take part in Dasara every year, their numbers were reduced as the festival itself was curtailed in view of the pandemic this year.

A priest performed the customary puja for the collective welfare of the elephants and their safe return next year after which Abhimanyu and team were fed with sugarcane and jaggery. After the customary farewell, the elephants were herded to their designated truck which transported them to the jungle camps in Nagarahole.

For Abhimanyu this was a special occasion as he carried the golden howdah with the idol of Goddess Chamundeshwari for the first time, the mantle having passed on to him from his predecessor Arjuna. The four elephants that accompanied Abhimanyu included Vikrama, Gopi, Vijaya and Kaveri.

However, the usual crowd of tourists and the local people who would congregate to see off the elephants every year, was missing this year. The imperatives of maintaining social distancing, the restriction on entry to the palace – where the elephants had camped for nearly a fortnight in the run up to Dasara – and the fear of the coronavirus, ensured that people stayed away from the event.

The elephants were brought from Veeranahosahalli on the outskirts of Nagarahole to Mysuru on October 2. Senior Forest Department officials were present on the occasion. On Tuesday, the mahouts and their assistants were given a reception by the local authorities for their role in Dasara and presented with a cheque in appreciation of their services.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cjb8r7/article32966389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28MYSJUMBOS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/elephant-abhimanyu-and-team-head-back-to-jungle-camps/article32966351.ece

108,2020/10/28,Seer fasts for revised Panchamsali reservation,"Basava Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swami, seer of the Panchamasali Peetha, held a one-day symbolic fast in front of the Suvarna Soudha in Belagavi district on Wednesday, seeking inclusion of Panchamsali community among the most backward classes under 2A category.

The seer came in a car with a solar roof, waving a saffron flag. He garlanded the statues of Basaveshwara, Rani Channamma, Ambedkar and Sangolli Rayanna before moving to the Suvarna Soudha.

He said a statue of Rani Channamma, who belonged to the Panchamsali community, should be erected in front of the Suvarna Soudha.

District in-charge Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, Rajya Sabha member Eeranna Kadadi, former Minister Vinay Kulkarni, and former MLA and district BJP president Sanjay Patil met the seer to express solidarity with him.

The seer told journalists that the Panchamsali community, the largest sub-caste of Lingayats in terms of numbers, had been deprived socially and economically. It was presently in the 3B category of Other Backward Classes. This category covers 85 caste groups with only five per cent reservation. “We want to be shifted to 2A that has fewer caste groups, but has 15 per cent reservation. This means that the chances of our youth getting education and employment benefits is increased three times.”

He defended his demand by saying that Panchamsalis were as backward as the other caste groups in 2A category. Over 90 per cent of the community members are either farmers or farm labourers. They have suffered losses since the 90s when agriculture became less remunerative. They have not been able to send their children to good schools or colleges. There is a generation of talented Panchamsali youth who have not got the opportunities they deserve, he claimed.

He said he would appeal to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to recall the support given to him by the community since his initial days in politics. “We have been making this demand before every government till now, but it was not accepted. Now that we have a Lingayat Chief Minister, we are hopeful of getting our demands met.”

He said that his demand for a separate Lingayat religion was not in contravention of the demand for reservation for Lingayat sub-sects. “They are two different things and the demands are made before two different platforms. While the Central government has to grant us the minority tag, it is the State government that has to readjust our reservation categories. I am actively involved in both the agitations.’’",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/svbbyh/article32963645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28belagavi-fast-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/seer-fasts-for-revised-panchamsali-reservation/article32963622.ece

111,2020/10/28,Voting begins for four legislative council seats in Karnataka,"The MLC polls are taking place for four seats that fell vacant due to retirement of leaders.

Polling for four legislative council seats got underway in Karnataka on Wednesday amid the COVID-19 pandemic situation.

The MLC polls are taking place for Karnataka South-East Graduates, Karnataka West Graduates’, Karnataka North-East Teachers’ and Bangalore Teachers’ constituencies, which fell vacant due to the retirement of R. Chowda Reddy Thoopalli, S.V. Sankanur, Sharanappa Mattur and Puttanna respectively.

The polling began at 8 a.m. and would conclude at 5 p.m. The counting of votes will be held on November 2.

Forty candidates are trying their luck in the elections. Among them are the four whose retirement on June 30 warranted the elections. There are 2.35 lakh voters in these four constituencies.

Security has been beefed up at the polling stations. Prohibitory orders under section 144 of the CrPC have been imposed in and around the booths.

The Election Commission has directed the returning officers to ensure that face masks and social distancing should be maintained by the staff as well as the voters. Following the guidelines, arrangements have been made for hand sanitisers and thermal screening at all the booths. There are medical teams deployed around the polling centres as well.

The election is crucial for the BJP as it lacks a majority in the state Legislative Council to pass the crucial bills.

The BJP government could not pass the farm bills and labour reforms amendment bills in the recently held legislature session as it could not get through the upper house despite getting passed in the assembly.

115,2020/10/28,Some MSMEs in Karnataka show signs of recovery,"Auto sector rings in slight recovery, bringing positivity to ancillary units

The auto ancillary and supply chain industries in Karnataka have started showing signs of recovery with the sales numbers of passenger cars, commercial vehicles, two wheelers and bicycles picking up in the last two months.

The State has over six lakh medium, small and micro enterprises, and the entire MSME sector has been reeling from the slowdown triggered the pandemic.

T.R. Parasuraman, president, BCIC, and president and all-time director of Toyota Industries Engine India, said, “The worst is getting over, especially for the automotive segment. Volumes are picking up and there is demand in local markets, while exports are also slowly happening.”

Most automobile firms are back on track and the supply chain also got a boost to a great extent as the demand for parts and spares started coming in. Some companies are working in multiple shifts to deliver their orders, he said. “Pockets of worries and minor aberrations are there, such as the U.S. elections and a second wave of COVID-19 in Europe. However, the overall panic has settled down, and the fear psychosis is over in India,” he said.

D.R. Subramanyam, CII Karnataka State Council Member and MD of SLN Technologies, said the military side of defence and aerospace have not been impacted much by COVID-19. However, civil aerospace has been affected badly and it will take two years to recover. “In fact, aircraft manufacturers have cut production by 40% and recovery may happen only by 2024 depending on how many people will resume travel,” he added.

Many trade bodies are in the process of studying the impact of the pandemic on their member companies, and no proper quantification has been arrived at yet.

“While a definite financial loss figure is difficult to quantify, it can still be safely assumed that the loss in industrial output may run into tens of thousands of crores in the State keeping in mind the MSMEs (manufacturing) account for nearly 10% of GDP,” said K.B. Arasappa, president, Kassia. “Assuming manufacturing SMEs employ about three million workers in Karnataka, a 10% attrition due to COVID-19 means a loss of 3 lakh jobs attributable to the pandemic.”

It has been conservatively estimated that only 60-70% of normal production has been restored after six months in the badly affected segments. About 15% industries in the most vulnerable micro enterprises segment may have permanently shut shop unable to recover from the shock. The output loss, year on year, for the period, could be as high as 30% in those badly affected segments of MSMEs, as per data provided by Kassia.

M.C. Dinesh, former president, FKCCI, and entrepreneur, said the government has to make all efforts to generate demand in the market. It has to announce infrastructure projects and spend on infrastructure to stimulate the economy. “The government also has to effectively address the needs of the MSMEs and kiranas that are an integral part of daily life,” he added.

According to FKCCI president Perikal Sundar, the pandemic has triggered some start-up activities in the State. “Sheep and goat-rearing has increased 25-30% compared to pre-COVID-19 period. Our youth deserve commendation for initiating new start-ups by taking the pandemic as an opportunity. Many youngsters have also started business ventures around farming and agriculture.''

Most trade bodies felt, the first-time MSME borrowers in the state could not benefit from the government’s ₹3 lakh crore relief package that came under COVID-19 Emergency COVID Loan, as loans up to ₹20 lakh were given only to the existing borrowers and not to new borrowers and because of this, small companies suffered huge working capital shortage.

The labour disruption caused by the departure of migrants is yet to normalise even after six months with 15-20% workers either permanently moving out or yet to return, hurting the labour intensive industries like garments the most, said trade bodies.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a2js0m/article32958846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGVEHICLESFORMSMES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/some-msmes-in-karnataka-show-signs-of-recovery/article32958847.ece
116,2020/10/28,COVID-19 | Testing drops over two days in Karnataka,"Doctors say this may have been on account of festivals

For the second consecutive day, the number of COVID-19 tests conducted in the State declined.

On Monday (reflected in Tuesday’s health bulletin), as many as 66,701 tests were conducted in the State. As many as 3,691 new COVID-19 cases were reported on Tuesday. On Sunday, the total tests stood at 65,862. This is in contrast to previous days when the tests crossed the one lakh mark.

Bengaluru Urban

Of the 3,691 cases that were reported in the State in Tuesday’s bulletin by the Health and Family Welfare Department, as many as 1,874 new COVID-19 positive cases were reported in Bengaluru Urban. However, the positivity rate for the day remained at 5.53%. The total number of COVID-19 cases in the State stands at 8.09 lakh.

C.N. Manjunath, nodal officer, labs and testing, COVID-19 task force, said that the number of tests may have declined due to the holiday and the festive season. He however argued that the positivity rate was still around 5%. “We will ensure that our testing is robust and rigorous in the coming days,” he said.

Responding to the decrease in number of cases over the last few days, Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said that government was not hiding or providing wrong information regarding the statistics pertaining to COVID 19. He also said that the cases had declined due to the efforts of the corona warriors. The number of cases have decreased and deaths have come down, he added.

44 deaths

Meanwhile, the number of deaths reported on Tuesday stood at 44, taking the total number to 10,991. Besides this, as many as 19 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 died to other reasons. The case fatality rate for the day stood at 1.19 %.

Tuesday saw as many as 7,740 patients being discharged, taking the total number of discharges to 7.27 lakh. With this, the recovery rate in Karnataka stands at 89.83%.

117,2020/10/28,COVID-19: Panel to chalk out modalities of vaccination in Karnataka,"State could have access to vaccine early in 2021: Minister

The State government will within a week form a committee to look into the modalities of distribution of COVID-19 vaccine, said Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar. The State could have access to the vaccine early in 2021, he said.

He was speaking at a press conference after a meeting with the officials of AstraZeneca, one of the firms involved in research and trial of COVID-19 vaccine. The Minister said that the company, in collaboration with Serum Institute, Pune, has been conducting vaccine trials in the country and has also been conducting trials in collaboration with Oxford University.

When asked if the vaccine would be provided to people in the State free of cost, Dr. Sudhakar said no decision had been made in this regard. “The vaccine is still in the trial stage. Once it is out, our State government would take a decision,” he said. Earlier, Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan had announced free vaccination for all.

Dr. Sudhakar also said that a technical committee will be formed in collaboration with the Union Health Ministry and the distribution of vaccine will be discussed in the committee.

First phase

He said that frontline health workers, senior citizens, persons with comorbidities, and pregnant and lactating mothers would be vaccinated in the first phase. He said that although the trials were on and those who were administered the vaccine found to have neutralising antibodies, they had evidence only for 56 days. The Minister also said that AstraZeneca was producing the vaccine on a no-profit-no-loss basis.

He said that the State government was also in touch with Bharat Biotech International Ltd., which is conducting trials for Covaxin.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/epv2am/article32736489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGSUDHAKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-panel-to-chalk-out-modalities-of-vaccination/article32958816.ece
118,2020/10/28,"Tourism, hospitality sector continues to bleed","It is yet to recoup from the lockdown; hotel bookings did not exceed 25% during this Dasara

The tourism and hospitality sector in Mysuru continues to bleed and register low growth, and the stakeholders are pessimistic of a turnaround despite the unlocking and the dawn of the festival season.

The sector is yet to recoup from the lockdown imposed due to the pandemic and the tourist footfall was also insignificant during the just-concluded Dasara which is a fulcrum to promote tourism during normal times.

The famed Jamboo Savari was confined to the palace premises and only around 300 people were allowed, and even the people of Mysuru were not present thanks to the imperatives of ensuring social distancing to fight COVID-19.

Narayana Gowda of the Mysuru Hotel Owners’ Association said the bookings did not exceed 25% at any point of time during Dasara as against cent per cent occupancy during the pre-pandemic years. There are nearly 8,000 rooms catering to various category of tourists of which only 25% were booked while many hotels have even stopped accepting bookings as they intend to sell the property. “Though a section of the media was projecting a huge turnout especially during nights, they were locals out to view the city illumination and did not make any impact on the tourism sector,” said Mr. Gowda.

Meanwhile, the number of visitors to the Mysuru palace which has a ticketed entry, remains low. In all, 1,920 people – mainly locals – visited the palace on October 25 while 1,360 tickets were sold the previous day. The highest daily turnout in October so far was on October 2 when the palace attracted 3,258 people. This is against the normal footfall in excess of 15,000 that used to be registered during the same period in the past years.

The Mysuru zoo used to be open the visitors even on Tuesdays – which otherwise is closed – during the peak holiday season commencing from October. This was to ensure that the visiting tourists did not return disappointed. But not so this year and the authorities closed the zoo for Tuesdays in view of the poor footfalls.

Mysuru palace normally receives around 3.5 million tourists every year but not so this year. The palace was closed during lockdown and it received 1250 tourists in June and 725 tourists in July and 10539 in August. There was a slight surge in September when 30,425 people visited the palace. However, it is not enough to neutralize the setback afflicting the tourism sector which generates nearly 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh jobs in Mysuru alone.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/e1wnm/article32958806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGPALACE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tourism-hospitality-sector-continues-to-bleed/article32958807.ece
119,2020/10/28,Inauguration of new safari zone put on hold,"Decision not to open Nugu sanctuary for tourists came hours after invitation for inauguration emerged on social media

The Forest Department has put on hold the inauguration of a tourism zone with facilities for safari, which was slated in the Nugu Wildlife Sanctuary for Friday. Nugu Wildlife Sanctuary is part of notified buffer zone of the Bandipur Tiger Reserve since 2010 and an eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) since 2012.

The decision against opening Nugu sanctuary for tourists came within hours after the invitation for the inauguration emerged on social media and elicited criticism.

R. Balachandra, director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, said a proposal for the new safari zone was pending before the government for long and was yet to get clearance. He said they have sought fresh assessment of its feasibility, besides other clarifications, and any decision on the Nugu safari and tourism zone has been put on hold.

When asked about the invitation, Mr. Balachandra said it was released without his knowledge and reiterated that there was no opening of a new safari zone at Nugu.

Sources said that there should not be another tourism zone in Bandipur which is already saturated.

They added that if there is an additional zone, it would result in proliferation of related commercial activities over time which would encourage human intrusion.

“There could be additional hotels and resorts, which are prohibited as per an ESZ notification and even the Supreme Court issued directives against it in 2012,” said an activist. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) also has to approve the proposal before any swathe of forest can be opened up for tourists.

Bandipur was the first national park to get ESZ notified and in the consultative meetings, elected representatives and the locals were unanimous against expanding tourism activities in the forests.

At present, only ‘Zone A’, around Mangala village, is open to tourism and increasing it will violate ESZ guidelines, said activists.

There are also speculations that the department – which has a history of cracking down on illegal homestays since 2012 – could be under pressure from the political lobby. Sources said influential leaders were holding large swathes of land in the region and officials could be under pressure to open up Nugu as it could be commercially beneficial to them.

Activists pointed out that Nugu is a vulnerable area as far as human-elephant conflicts are concerned, and that the msot elephant depredation cases are from there and introducing the safari would escalate conflicts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/enl64h/article32958778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGSAFARIZONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/inauguration-of-new-safari-zone-put-on-hold/article32958781.ece

122,2020/10/28,Fire breaks out in industry partly owned by Pralhad Joshi,"Raw material reportedly worth lakhs of rupees were gutted in a phenyl and broomsticks manufacturing industry at Sherewad near Hubballi on Monday night.

Union Minister Pralhad Joshi and H.N. Nandakumar, brother of the former Union Minister late Ananthkumar, have a partnership in Vibhav Industries where the fire broke out.

On being alerted, the Hubballi Rural Police and Fire and Emergency Services personnel immediately rushed to the spot and extinguished the fire, sources said.

The CEO of Vibhav Industries [Mr. Nandakumar] said that as there was more demand post lockdown, they had stored more raw material.

As a holiday had been declared on account of festivals, there were no workers in the factory when the fire broke out.

124,2020/10/28,People in big positions should sacrifice smaller posts: Minister,"Ramesh Jarkiholi hints that Laxman Savadi should drop plans to contest bank polls

With the battle for the District Central Cooperative Bank heating up, district in-charge Minister and BJP leader Ramesh Jarkiholi hinted in Belagavi on Tuesday that his political rival and Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi should drop his plans of contesting for the bank polls. Those in big positions of power should sacrifice the smaller posts and ensure that their followers win elections to local bodies and cooperative institutions, Mr. Jarkiholi said, while referring to the DCC Bank polls scheduled for November 6. But when asked if he was referring to Mr. Savadi, he denied it and said that he was making a general statement. “RSS leaders are guiding us to see that the DCC Bank elections are held in a harmonious manner, without any strife. Senior RSS leader Arvind Rao Deshpande has asked us to see that the elections are conducted peacefully in a cordial manner. However, such advise can be followed properly only when people in big positions of power make sacrifices. They should give up plans for contesting for smaller positions and should nominate their followers instead,” he clarified.

“For example, with the clout that I enjoy in Gokak, I can easily make my son a DCC Bank director from Gokak. But I will not do that. I am planning to field one of my party workers and see that he wins,” Mr. Jarkiholi explained.

He reiterated that he considered the DCC Bank polls to be non-political and that he had decided to go by the decision of the former Ministers Umesh Katti and Balachandra Jarkiholi in this matter.

Mr. Savadi, however, did not react to Mr. Jarkiholi’s statement. He only said that the BJP was set to grow stronger in the State with some Congress MLAs expressing their desire to cross over to the party.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6842x8/article32958698.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGRAMESHJARKIHOLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/people-in-big-positions-should-sacrifice-smaller-posts-minister/article32958699.ece
125,2020/10/28,Savadi seeks financial aid to help RTCs overcome loss,"The KSRTC and the other three State-run transport undertakings have sought around ₹3,000 crore financial support from the State government to help tide over the loss suffered due to the extended lockdown. Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Transport Laxman Savadi asked the government to absorb the cost of issuing bus passes to students.

Speaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony for a bus stand at Saundatti in Belagavi district on Tuesday, the Minister said all the corporations were facing losses and that BMTC alone was losing around ₹1.17 crore per day.

“We have not dismissed any employee and have paid all staff for six months since our operations were shut down in March. However, we are seeking help from the State government to pay salaries for another six months, till our finances improve,” he said.

He said the government could also relieve the burden of the corporations by absorbing the social security benefits of providing subsidised bus passes to students. The corporations were facing loss of around ₹2,960 crore. We are asking the government to absorb that cost and transfer the money to us so that our loss is reduced, he said.

He said the rising cost of diesel and other material was hitting the corporations hard since 2010. He said NWKRTC would provide four old buses remodelled as mobile toilets to the devotees in the Saundatti Yallamma temple. He said four training centres would be set up in Mudhol, Athani, Koppal, and Saundatti to train drivers. The Transport Department would spend ₹60 crore on the project.

Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, along with Congress candidate H. Kusuma, were addressing the roadshow highlighting the failure of the Narendra Modi-led Central government when a group of BJP Yuva Morcha members started shouting the slogans.

The police dispersed the group. Late on Tuesday, Yeshwantpur police registered an FIR against BJP workers who allegedly assaulted Congress workers twice during Mr. Siddaramaiah’s rally.

This was the second such incident where rival party members clashed.

128,2020/10/28,Video of women voters being wooed in Sira stirs hornets’ nest,"Congress seeks EC intervention; JD(S) complains to DC

A day after a video clip surfaced, purportedly showing the BJP workers offering money to women voters in Sira for arishina-kumkuma to entice them, the Congress has complained to the Election Commission on malpractices, while the JD(S) has approached the Deputy Commissioner and the police.

In the video, a man is seen telling a group of women that they have been ignored in elections always and they need to change the trend in this polls. He goes on to say that women will be paid ₹200 for arishina-kumkuma immediately, which will be followed by another ₹200 and money on election day.

The Congress on Tuesday petitioned the Election Commission over use of money in the elections by the BJP candidate and sought his disqualification. In a complaint to the EC through the CEO of Karnataka, KPCC working president Saleem Ahmed among others said distribution of money, liquor and other gifts by the BJP was in violation of the provisions under the election code and Indian Penal Code.

The BJP leaders have indulged in corrupt electoral malpractices by distributing money to more than one lakh voters, particularly women, they said. Money amounting to ₹2 crore had been distributed, they said. The agents of the BJP candidate have been giving money to voters at the behest of Pritham Gowda, Hassan city MLA. Tumakuru BJP president Suresh Gowda too has been luring voters through valuable gifts and influencing the results, the Congress alleged.

Meanwhile, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, referring to the video clip, drew attention to the fact that some women in the group had shouted that they would vote for the JD(S). He accused the BJP of distributing money using “outsiders”. The JD(S) social media in charge also tweeted asking what the Election Commission was doing about the video.

These developments are also being read as an indicator of the election mood, where women are being seen as holding the key. “Though women come in large numbers to vote, it is men who are mostly approached during canvassing. This time, the JD(S) has fielded a woman, the wife of the late legislator B. Sathyanarayana, and women could have sympathy towards her,” said a leader involved in campaigning in Sira. In the times of COVID-19 pandemic, women are also reluctant to step out for canvassing, the source said, adding that their turnout for voting remains crucial.

According to Mr. Kumaraswamy, women are being approached by people from outside the district, and women members of SHGs are being targeted. In several instances, women who have been approached for money, have chased away such persons from villages, and there have been instances of skirmishes, he alleged.

‘Desperate attempt’

However, the BJP has distanced itself from the video clip. “It’s a desperate attempt by the Congress and the JD(S) to find a reason. We have been preparing ourselves in the constituency for nearly two months now. The two parties have raised the money issue to find a reason for their defeat,” said N. Ravikumar, BJP spokesperson.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/video-of-women-voters-being-wooed-in-sira-stirs-hornets-nest/article32958493.ece

Mr. Gowda had said at a bypoll-related event in the city on Monday: “When the entire country was indoors taking precautions to stem the spread of COVID-19, D.K. Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah forcibly brought farmers and others to Bengaluru in the name of protests against farm Bills. Senior leader Maruti Manpade had also participated in this protest, contracted COVID-19, and unfortunately, died.”

Aikya Horata, a coalition of farmers, Dalits and labourers, that led the agitation against the farm Bills, on Tuesday came down heavily on Mr. Gowda. “It is the BJP governments at the Centre and the State that are responsible for the death of Maruti Manpade. It is they who misused a public health crisis and brought in sweeping changes through ordinances undemocratically, forcing people to take to the streets,” the samiti said in a release.

‘Shameless accusation’

Karnataka Pranta Raita Sangha (KPRS), of which Manpade was a senior leader, also criticised the Minister for what they called “shameless accusation”.

In a statement, they have stated that they are “shocked and concerned” that the government has not been providing the legally mandated midday meal or even dry rations since June to children enrolled in government-run and government-aided schools, which is a gross violation of their right to food and nutrition guaranteed under the National Food Security Act 2013. They have also said that the milk powder under the Ksheera Bhagya programme should also be supplied to the students.

The Hindu last week reported that after schools closed because of COVID-19 in March, midday meals were stopped and the State government had provided ration kits that included rice and toor dal for three months till May.

As many as 48 lakh children from classes 1 to 10 in government and aided schools depend on the midday meals. Many parents had also pointed out that as their livelihoods were affected owing to the pandemic, the nutrition levels of the children were also affected. Majority of the children in these schools come from lower socio-economic backgrounds and marginalised communities.

Officials of the Department of Public Instruction stated that the dry rations would soon be supplied to the children in government and aided schools as soon as a government order was issued.

“We are hoping to provide rations forJune and July as soon as possible. The rations for the subsequent months will also be provided,” the official added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pwk22w/article32958337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGMID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/doctors-activists-lawyers-petition-govt-to-provide-ration-in-schools/article32958338.ece
134,2020/10/28,State’s first mussel and sea fish hatchery to come up at Puthiyangadi,"The facility aims to produce 50 lakh mussel seeds a year

Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma has said construction work on the fish landing centre at Puthiyangadi will begin by December.

The Minister was inaugurating the construction of Kerala’s first mussel and sea fish hatchery at Puthiyangadi through videoconferencing. She said that with the help of technology, a direct hatchery for production of mussel and seafood was becoming a reality in Kannur.

Ms. Mercykutty Amma said the government was giving due consideration to the Malabar region when it came to coastal development activities. The opening of the hatchery in the Malabar region where mussel farming is most prevalent will be a great leap in the sector.

She said quality seeds were being produced through research with the help of the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI). The hatchery aims to produce 50 lakh sea fish and 50 lakh mussel seeds a year, the Minister said, adding that it would be raised to one crore.

In view of the declining availability of fish in the State, several schemes are being implemented under the Department of Fisheries to enhance fish production. A major issue facing fish farmers is poor availability of quality fish seed. It is mostly supplied to farmers from other States or drawn directly from waterbodies, she observed.

The marine fish seed production centre will be set up at Puthiyangadi to ensure availability of quality fish seed to farmers. The construction of the centre will be carried out by the Kerala Coastal Development Corporation. The aim is to make the project a reality within 10 months. The fish seed centre will be set up at a cost of ₹5 crore.

The hatchery covers an area of ​​1208.6 square metres for seed production and rearing, 133-metre-long drainage system, an FRP tank with a capacity of 30 tonnes, and other modern facilities.

T.V. Rajesh, MLA, laid the foundation stone for the hatchery. Rajmohan Unnithan, MP, was the chief guest. District Panchayat President K.V. Sumesh and Kalyassery block panchayat president V.V. Preetha were also present.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/states-first-mussel-and-sea-fish-hatchery-to-come-up-at-puthiyangadi/article32966659.ece
135,2020/10/28,Walayar case: CBI probe sought,"Yuva Morcha stages march to Minister A. K. Balan’s house in Palakkad

The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) staged a march to Minister for SC, ST and Backward Classes Welfare A.K. Balan’s house here on Wednesday, demanding a CBI investigation into the Walayar case involving the alleged rape and death of two minor sisters.

The protesters also demanded punitive action against the police officers responsible for scuttling the case. A POCSO court here had exonerated all the accused in the case in October last year after the prosecution failed to prove that the accused were guilty.

BJYM State president C.R. Praful Krishnan inaugurated the march. District president Prasanth Sivan presided.

Mr. Krishnan alleged that Minister A.K. Balan was responsible for scuttling the case. He said Punnala Sreekumar was introduced in the case “with the objective of saving the CPI(M) leaders responsible for the rape and murder of the minor girls.”

“Mr. Balan, who denounced the agitation by the victims’ parents, has no moral right to continue in the Minister’s chair. Police and Punnala Sreekumar acted in accordance with the script prepared by Mr. Balan,” he said. The BJYM criticized the CPI(M) for promoting Dy.SP. M.J. Sojan and Sub Inspector P.C. Chacko, who allegedly scuttled the case by building it weak and thin.

LDF criticised

Meanwhile, Kodikkunnil Suresh, MP, who visited the protesting parents of the Walayar victims at their house on Tuesday, said that the LDF government was behaving like the Sangh Parivar in their attitude to the Dalits.

“The tears flowing from the eyes of the Walayar victims’ parents will not be good for Kerala,” he said.

137,2020/10/28,State’s case graph plateauing,"8,790 new cases when 66,980 samples tested in the 24 hours

The State’s COVID-19 case graph, which had dipped following a slump in testing during the long weekend, assumed its normal course on Wednesday registering 8,790 new cases when 66,980 samples were tested in the past 24 hours.

If the official figures released by the Health Department are reliable, the graph is indeed plateauing now, even though the possibility of it taking on another trajectory and spiking cannot be ruled out.

Epidemiologists pointed out that the State’s weekly growth rate, which used to be 10-15% two weeks ago, has come down to less than 5% in the week from October 18- 25 and the active case pool has also stabilised at around 95,000.

While the cumulative case burden reached 4,11,464, the active cases is 93,264. The test positivity rate was 13.12%.

138,2020/10/28,"Amidst speculations of arrest, ED interrogates Sivasankar","Probe agency takes him away from a private Ayurveda hospital

The questioning of M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) stretched into Wednesday night amidst speculations about his possible arrest in connection with the money laundering angle of the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case.

The interrogation, which began around 3.30 p.m., was progressing at the agency's office here at the time of filing this report. Customs officials questioned Mr. Sivasankar at the ED office in connection with the department's probe into the case.

The day's drama unfolded after the Kerala High Court rejected his anticipatory bail in the morning. Two ED officials arrived at a private Ayurveda hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, where Mr. Sivasankar was undergoing treatment for back pain and served him a summons for further interrogation.

The embattled bureaucrat appeared stoic and refused to answer questions from journalists as he emerged from the hospital flanked by plain clothes officers. The investigating team soon whisked him away in their official car to their office in Kochi.

The agency suspected that Mr. Sivasankar helped gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh conceal the vast proceeds from the crime in bank lockers and accounts. Swapna had allegedly spirited away a part of the booty to Dubai in foreign currency, and Mr. Sivasankar had accompanied her on some of the trips.

The ED believed that the illegal profits were ploughed back into the gold smuggling operation headed by persons with suspicious links to radical organisations in the country and abroad.

Hence, the agency wanted to question him under Sections 16, 17 and 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The provisions relate to raising funds, directly or indirectly, for anti-national activities and include offences that imperil the economic security of the country. The illegal acts under the UAPA are also ""scheduled"" offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).

The Customs officials quizzed Mr. Sivasankar on his links with Swapna. It is learnt that the interrogation was based on the call data records of Swapna and their joint trips to the UAE, especially in 2018 and 2019. The details of certain calls made from Swapna's mobile number to an unknown number after the gold consignment was seized on July 5 were also inquired by the investigating team.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/amidst-speculations-of-arrest-ed-interrogates-sivasankar/article32965725.ece

The party's political affairs committee met briefly via video link to discuss the matter given the move on the part of the IUML to mobilise other backward class social organisations to thwart the policy.

The Congress appeared keen not to provoke influential social organisations such as the SNDP Yogam and Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha (KPMS) that have reacted favourably to the IUML's overture.

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran said the Congress had backed the amendment to increase reservation quota to 60% in Parliament. The party was not against extending reservation to the poor among forward castes. However, the party was opposed to the bungling manner in which the LDF government had implemented the policy in Kerala.

140,2020/10/28,Private bus operators demand package,"The private bus operators in the State has demanded a special package on the lines of the revival package announced by the government for the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC).

“The private bus operators operate three times more services than the KSRTC. But 80% of the buses are off roads due to poor patronage. We were given only six months concession in road tax from April due to COVID-19. This benefited only 20% of the stage carriers and the tax concession amounted to ₹7 crore,” president of Kerala State Private Bus Operators Federation M.B. Satyan and general secretary Lawerence Babu said.

At the same time, the KSRTC was being provided funds from the exchequer to pay the monthly salary of employees and pension. The government announced that it would write off ₹961 crore from the KSRTC and decided to convert ₹3,194 crore loan as equity.

In addition, the KSRTC would get ₹255 crore for medical reimbursement and for repaying the amount collected from the monthly salary of the employees. The permanent employees were to be given ₹1,500 as monthly interim relief when private bus operators were finding it difficult to fund their fuel needs, they added.

The government should understand that the private sector was also part and parcel of the public transport sector of the State and hence it should not be discriminated against. The government should intervene and come up with a special package for the survival of the private bus industry, Mr. Babu added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/private-bus-operators-demand-package/article32965326.ece
141,2020/10/28,Survivor of actor rape case moves HC for court change,"State’s plea for transfer of court to come up tomorrow

Aggrieved by the ""biased and hostile attitude"" of the court considering the female actor rape case, the survivor has moved the Kerala High Court for transferring the trial to another court.

The State has also moved the High Court for the transfer of court in the case, which is likely to come up for hearing on Friday.

In her petition, the actor submitted that the Special Judge of the Additional Special Sessions Judge (SPE/CBI)-3, Ernakulam, ""sat like a mute spectator"" when she was examined and harassed by the counsel of actor Dileep, the 8th accused.

The court failed to record certain portions of the testimonies deliberately and without any lawful justification and the repeated prayers of the Special Public Prosecutor to record them fell on deaf ears, she submitted.

She complained that the court failed to restrict the number of lawyers of the accused in the court hall during her examination and thus failed to uphold the spirit of the in-camera trial. The application of the prosecution to cancel the bail granted to Dileep was kept pending. A witness in the case complained to the survivor that she was harassed by the court for one of her Facebook posts, the actor submitted.

Responding to the developments, legal sources maintained that neither the victim nor any witness raised the complaints of bias or hostility during the days of of their examination or the preceding days. A balance was always struck regarding the number of lawyers and other officials who would be present in the court hall from both the prosecution and defence benches in the true spirit of the in-camera proceedings, sources said.

On the complaint of the court remaining a mute spectator, legal sources indicated that the court could interfere in the cross-examination only when some scandalous references are made against the victim or attempts to degrade her character are made in the court. In no other circumstances, the court can intervene in the cross-examination of witnesses, which is part of the fair trial.

Other than the legally permissible interactions, no derogatory and scandalous remarks or allegations were made in the court and the decorum of the judicial proceedings was always maintained, sources said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/survivor-of-actor-rape-case-moves-hc-for-court-change/article32965211.ece

The Kudumbashree mission is launching Utsav, an online shopping campaign, from November 4 to 19 to make the most of the accelerated shift to online shopping in recent times.

Timed to coincide with the Deepavali festivities, the Kudumbashree Utsav aims at promotion of the Kudumbashree’s online portal www.kudumbashreebazaar.com and increasing its visibility.

The festival, on the lines of those launched by e-commerce firms, will help Kudumbashree products reach maximum number of people, on the strength of attractive discounts.

Shipment across the country will be free during the festival, courtesy a tie-up with India Post. The entire shipment cost will be borne by the Kudumbashree. So, there will be no increase in product cost to adjust the shipment expenses, nor will consumers have to bear any shipment cost, say Kudumbashree officials.

There will be 20% reduction on 600 products on sale as part of the campaign, though the Kudumbashree’s product line-up extends to 1,020, from 350 producers.

Additional 10% discount will be offered through promotional codes to attract more customers. Some entrepreneurs are offering additional discounts too. This will bring the discount on products to up to 50%, officials point out.

The festival is also an attempt by the Kudumbashree to go local, that is spur local product purchase.

There will be specific festivals as part of Utsav such as pickle festival, ethnic snacks, homemade handicrafts, household kitchen equipment such as ‘tawas’ and ‘chattis,’ besides promotion of Kudumbashree’s branded products from Attapady and Kasaragod.

Minister for Transport A.K. Saseendran has said that a comprehensive action plan for the revival and modernisation of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) will be implemented within six months.

At a news conference here on Wednesday, Mr. Saseendran said that the action plan which would be implemented under the recently announced financial package of the State government would focus on the recommendations of the Sushil Khanna committee for reducing expenses and enhancing non-ticket revenue. KSRTC Chairman and Managing Director Biju Prabhakar was also present at the news conference.

New buses

The Minister said that the KSRTC had chalked out plans to lease its land on a long-term basis so as to generate revenue. Also, it would purchase 100 new buses using the ₹50-crore plan grant.

The new buses, including eight sleeper buses, 20 semi-sleeper buses and 72 express buses, are expected to begin services by January 2021.

Mr. Saseendran said that the KSRTC had also plans to purchase 310 CNG buses with funds sourced from the KIIFB. A new subsidiary company KSRTC-SWIFT would be formed for operating buses funded by the KIIFB by January 1.

Besides, the KSRTC will undertake conversion of existing buses from diesel to CNG and LNG in a phased manner. Discussions to procure loans from KIIFB and other agencies for converting all the existing ordinary buses of KSRTC into LNG were in process.

The conversion of buses to CNG and LNG would reduce the operating expenses by ₹25 crore, he said.

Computerisation

Mr. Saseendran said that the computerisation of the KSRTC for ₹16.98 crore would be implemented this fiscal. Also the vehicle tracking system, passenger information system and electronic ticketing facility will be launched on March next.

145,2020/10/28,Rankles among groups over Kerala’s EWS reservation move,"Speculations rife on how upcoming Assembly polls might turn out in the light of the developments over the proposal

The proposal of the Cabinet to implement 10% reservation for economically weaker sections (EWS) in the State has triggered political and communal debates with Muslim organisations, irrespective of their ideological moorings, opposing the new quota policy.

Almost all Muslim denominations, including the two rivals Sunni groups led by Syed Jifri Muthukoya Thangal and Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobaker Musliyar, are on the same page. Incidentally, the organisations are traditionally either backed or favoured by the Congress-led United Democratic Front and the CPI (M)-led Left Democratic Front.

Also the Welfare Party of India affiliated to the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Social Democratic Party of India, the political outfit of the Popular Front of India, are fiercely opposed to earmarking reservation for the EWS belonging to the forward Hindu and the Christian communities.

Assembly elections

How the political developments over the reservation proposal echo in the Assembly polls next year is now in the realm of speculation. Interestingly, even partners within the two coalitions have different opinions on the issue.

At the same time, the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam says it will move the Supreme Court against the 10% reservation in education and employment for the EWS among forward communities.

Its general secretary Vellappally Natesan, while terming the proposal as a move with an eye on the Assembly elections, however, declared that his organisation will not join hands with the Muslim organisations for any protest for their communal stances on various issues.

However, the Nair Service Society (NSS) called for rectifying the anomalies in the new reservation policy of the State government.

The reservation norms for the EWS candidates should be at par with the norms provided for other backward classes and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and also implement them with retrospective effect from January 2019, it said.

At the Centre

Interestingly, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre, which introduced 10% reservation for EWS, did not make such reservations mandatory in State-run educational institutions or government jobs. But some States have decided to implement the decision.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nthteh/article32969277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27-10-20-tvmp-muslim-nethakkalude-yogam-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ews-reservation-rankles-kerala-polity/article32965082.ece

Earlier, mills decided to keep away from procurement after they failed to reach an agreement with the government over compensation for the procured paddy, which got destroyed in the 2018 floods.

Following this, the government decided to rope in cooperative societies to procure paddy directly from farmers. However, a lack of storage, among other facilities for cooperative societies in the district, resulted in a delay in the procurement.

The Left Democratic Front (LDF) on Wednesday seemed to scramble to prevent a mustering of backward class organisations under the aegis of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) against the government on the issue of providing 10% reservation in government jobs for economically disadvantaged persons from forward caste communities.

The CPI(M) State secretariat pointed out the IUML had backed the policy in its 2011 Assembly election manifesto. However, the party had backtracked on its stance to foment communal polarisation ahead of the elections in 2021.

The CPI(M) said the IUML premise that the government had stacked the decks in favour of forward caste communities in admission to professional colleges and employment in administration and public sector units was built on a set of tottering lies.

Bill passed in LS

The Lok Sabha had passed the Constitution (124th Amendment) Bill, 2019, with an overwhelming majority to succour the poor among forward castes without diminishing the existing 50% quota for SC/ST and backward class communities.

It had enhanced reservation from 50% to 60% to ensure that the allocation for historically marginalised sections of society remained intact.

The LDF government would ensure that nobody misused the new reservation policy to rob the backward classes and SC/ST communities of their due.

LDF manifesto

The LDF manifesto had promised social justice for all. The CPI(M) had recognised poverty as a marker of backwardness much earlier than other parties. It had ensured that the creamy layer ineligibility criteria did not deprive backward castes of their allocation.

CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran said backward caste, and SC/ST communities would abandon the IUML when they realised that the 10% reservation for economically weaker sections among forward castes did not infringe on their 50% quota.

The State government had implemented the reservation policy carefully and under the supervision of a retired judge. It had taken special care that the amended norms did not harm the interests of backward sections of society, he said.

Support for LDF

The LDF appeared to have found support from unexpected quarters. The Syro-Malabar Church has criticised the IUML for opposing the economic reservation for the poor among forward castes. However, Latin Catholic social organisations have opposed the move.

The front was reportedly apprehensive that the “false campaign” on the reservation issue would render its traditional base among the numerously superior backward class voters hostile to the government ahead of the local body and Assembly elections.

Cong. cautious

The Congress seemed to have tread carefully on the issue so as not to provoke the influential backward class social organisations that appeared to be on the same page as the IUML.

KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said the Congress had backed the amendment in Parliament.

However, the party was opposed to the bungling manner in which the LDF government had implemented the policy in Kerala. The political affairs committee of the KPCC would deliberate the issue, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qbh1rb/article32964392.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27-10-20-tvmp-muslim-nethakkalude-yogam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ldf-takes-on-iuml-over-quota-issue/article32964393.ece
149,2020/10/28,Syro-Malabar church lashes out at UDF,"It says the front’s stand isn’t clear on the proposed reservation for EWS among forward communities

As debates continue over the State government’s move to implement reservation for economically weaker sections (EWS) among the forward communities, the Syro-Malabar church on Wednesday launched a scathing attack on the United Democratic Front (UDF) for its ambiguous position on the issue.

In an article titled ‘Why intolerance over economic reservation’, published in Deepika, the official mouth-piece of the church, Metropolitan Archbishop Mar Joseph Perumthottam sought to know whether the UDF system had become so anaemic to even register its opinion on the matter. It further accused the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) of being communal in opposing the economic reservation.

“About 27% of the population in the State belong to the non-reservation categories who have never enjoyed any benefit of this scheme till now. The move to ensure equal justice to this category of people has not come too soon and it is so unfortunate to see that a few community organisations are still opposing this. There are no reasons whatsoever to think that they have adopted a principled stance on the matter,” it read.

Accusing the UDF of losing control over its legislators, the Metropolitan sharply criticised the coalition’s proposed association with the Welfare Party. “It seems this alliance will not be even able to come out with an election manifesto,” he said.

The article further elaborated on the need to uphold secularism in a plural society and warned against the tendency among some political organisations of taking particular communities for granted. “This land embraces a cross-section of people and the alliances should be able to consider all reasonable demands by different sections. However, the attempts by the coalitions to align with communal forces for votes will only help raise concerns among the other sections,” it noted.

Meanwhile, the article lauded the Left parties as well as the Bharatiya Janata Party for coming clean on the issue.

Incidentally, the article came out with only a few hours left for the Congress-led coalition convene a meeting of its political affairs committee to decide its position on the EWS reservation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wqmv77/article32969245.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29tv-Perumthottam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/syro-malabar-church-lashes-out-at-udf/article32964309.ece
150,2020/10/28,A bid to keep Wagamon’s verdant beauty intact,"Green check-posts collect plastic waste from visitors

As you pass through the hill station of Wagamon, you are stopped at a green check-post and women clad in green collect plastic from your vehicle. There are five such green check-posts manned by

members of the green army (Haritha Karma Sena) under the Elappara grama panchayat with the aim of making Wagamon plastic-free. Dumping plastic in the area is banned and those violating it is fined.

Sindhu, a member of the green army manning the check-post on the main road connecting Upputhara and Wagamon, said that the check-post was

manned 24-hours and 30 members took turns for it. “The green check-posts were erected two months ago as part of the efforts launched over a year ago to make Wagamon free of plastic waste,” she said.

According to Haritha Keralam Mission district coordinator G.S. Madhu, the project was being implemented in Wagamon in view of its importance as a hill station and the need for protecting its ecological sensitivity.

“A campaign was launched against plastic littering initially and then waste bins were set up at main junctions. Finally, the green check-posts were set up,” he said adding that this could be emulated in other tourism destinations in the State.

The user fee charged from the travellers is used for maintaining the check-posts and providing salary to the green army members. Sindhu said that since the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a considerable drop in the number of travellers. However, for the past few days, it was picking up.

Five in all

The five green-check posts are at Elappara town, Vattappathal, Pullikkanam, Vazhikkadavu and Chemmannu.

Mr. Madhu said the project, named ‘Vazhikatan Wagamon’ aimed at making the hill destination a green corridor.

During a visit, Haritha Keralam Mission executive vice-chairperson T.N. Seema and team found

that most parts of Wagamon were littered with waste, including plastic. Then a meeting was convened with the support of the District Collector and it was decided to erect green check-posts there.

Bottle booths

In addition, there were bottle booths at Upputhara, Elappara, Wagamon town, Wagamon Tea Junction, Pullikkanam, Mottakkunnu, Parking Ground

and Kochu Karuntharuvi. Tourists could deposit their plastic waste in these bottle booths, he added.

It was now a new experience for those visiting Wagamon as the verdant hills are retaining their beauty. The famous Pine Valley and Mottakunnu are literally litter-free.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-bid-to-keep-wagamons-verdant-beauty-intact/article32964269.ece

Suffragan Metropolitan Geevarghese Mar Theodosius will take charge as the 22nd Mar Thoma Metropolitan of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church on November 14.

A decision to install the Suffragan Metropolitan, who currently holds charge of the church, as the Mar Thoma Metropolitan was made during a meeting of the episcopal synod on Tuesday evening. The meeting also decided to conduct the installation ceremony at the church headquarters in Thiruvalla during a service at 8 a.m on November 14.

It will be followed by a meeting to felicitate the newly appointed Metropolitan, to be attended by eminent personalities including community and political leaders. An official statement said the entire programme would be organised in strict adherence to the COVID-19 guidelines of the government.

152,2020/10/28,RO plant inaugurated at Vayambachira,"Corporation to set up RO plants in waterbodies near areas experiencing high water scarcity

With an aim at making available drinking water at nominal rates to residents, the city Corporation has set up a reverse osmosis (RO) plant at the Vayambachira pond in Mannanthala.

The plant has been set up under the poverty alleviation mission programmes of the Kudumbashree, funded by the civic body.

The plant, set up at a cost of ₹75 lakh, has a capacity to purify 5,000 litres of water per hour. According to Corporation officials, they have been planning such RO plants in waterbodies located near areas experiencing high water scarcity.

Rates yet to be fixed

“But the plant cannot be set up in ponds or other waterbodies that go dry or in which the water level falls drastically during summers. The Mannanthala pond was thought to be ideal as it has ample capacity all through the year. Some of the areas near here also face water scarcity. So, this will become a step towards addressing that too. Ideally, anyone can buy water from here. The rates are yet to be fixed, which will be done by the Corporation council,” said an official of the Corporation’s engineering wing.

The project is also aimed at generating revenue for the local Kudumbashree unit, which has the responsibility of running the plant. The water extraction will be regulated in such a way as to not to affect the health of the waterbody.

The Vayambachira pond, spread over 1.55 acres, was under the Ulloor grama panchayat until the local body’s merger with the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation in 2000. In addition to natural replenishment by groundwater, small streams from nearby flows into it. But with houses coming up in recent decades, some of these streams were blocked.

The pond, which had fallen into disuse some years ago, was revived in recent years under various projects of the Corporation. Desilting was carried out and boundary walls were constructed to prevent encroachment.

City Corporation Mayor K. Sreekumar inaugurated the RO plant on Wednesday. C. Sudarshanan, chairman of the Corporation’s education standing committee, presided over the function.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ro-plant-inaugurated-at-vayambachira/article32964207.ece

154,2020/10/28,Northeast monsoon sets in over Kerala,"Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning are likely till November 1

The northeast monsoon has commenced over Kerala, said the India Meteorological Department’s centre here on Wednesday.

The southwest monsoon has fully withdrawn from the country and the northeast monsoon has officially arrived over the southern peninsula. Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning are likely at one or two places in Kerala till November 1, the IMD said in a weather update.

Meanwhile, the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has urged the public to be on guard against lightning strikes during the monsoon season.

In an advisory, the KSDMA asked the people to avoid open spaces, including rooftops and grounds and high locations, during lightning. The chances of lightning strikes are higher between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m. The warning especially applies to hilly regions where they can prove more dangerous.

KSDMA directive

In preparation for the northeast monsoon season, the KSDMA had directed local bodies and government departments to follow the guidelines given in the ‘Monsoon preparedness and emergency response plan’ for the State.

The State had recorded 27% excess rainfall during the 2019 northeast monsoon season. All districts except Idukki, Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram had reported either excess or large excess in rainfall during the 2019 season. The three districts had recorded normal rainfall. The 2020 southwest monsoon rainfall was normal for Kerala.

The Lakshadweep islands had recorded 164% excess rainfall during the 2019 northeast monsoon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/northeast-monsoon-sets-in-over-kerala/article32963530.ece
155,2020/10/28,"CJM grants bail to Jaleel, Jayarajan","Ministers ordered to post ₹ 35,000 each as bail amount.

Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram, R. Jayakrishnan on Wednesday granted bail to two Ministers alleged to be among the six Left Democratic Front (LDF) legislators responsible for the vandalism in the Legislative Assembly on March 13, 2015.

The police had arraigned Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan and Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel as accused in the offence which had occurred when they were in the opposition.

The LDF legislators had disrupted the Assembly to prevent the then Finance Minister K.M. Mani from delivering his budget speech on the ground that he had accepted a bribe from the Kerala Bar Hotel Association (KBHA) to revoke cancelled liquor permits.

Mr. Jayakrishnan ordered the Ministers, who presented themselves in his court, to post ₹ 35,000 each as bail amount.

The CJM had in September turned down a plea by the government to withdraw the case against the leaders. He had ruled that ""public interest"" and ""unity of the Legislature"" were not sufficient grounds to arbitrarily set aside a case that involved the wanton destruction of public property and unruly behaviour,

The CJM also saw no merit in the State's argument that any further prosecution of the accused would tantamount to double jeopardy. The Speaker had punished the legislators by expelling them from the House temporarily. Moreover, the protest was a political act to highlight corruption. The accused had no criminal intent; the government had argued.

The High Court had later upheld Mr. Jayakrishnan's order. It was now hearing a plea by the government to quash the case.

The case has its provenance in a report by the then legislature secretary P.D. Sarangadharan. He said the actions of the LDF members had destroyed public property worth ₹ 2 lakh.

The police case was that the six LDF MLAs had destroyed microphones, computers, grappled with the watch and ward and toppled the chair of the Speaker in their effort to prevent K.M. Mani from addressing the House.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4mo5bl/article32962785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KTJALEEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cjm-grants-bail-to-jaleel-jayarajan/article32962786.ece
156,2020/10/28,Kerala gold smuggling case | ED arrests suspended IAS officer Sivasankar soon after High Court rejects anticipatory bail plea,"He was taken into custody from Thiruvananthapuram and taken to Ernakulam by car.

The Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday detained former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, M. Sivasankar, for questioning in connection with the money laundering angle of the UAE consulate-linked gold smuggling case.

His arrest was recorded by around 10.15 p.m. after nearly seven hours of questioning by the investigating team at the agency’s office here. Mr. Sivasankar will be produced before the Principal Sessions Court, Ernakulam. on Thursday.

Anticipatory bail

The day’s drama unfolded after the Kerala High Court rejected his anticipatory bail in the morning. Two ED officials arrived at the private Ayurveda hospital where Mr. Sivasankar was undergoing treatment for chronic back pain and served him a summons for further interrogation at the agency's office in Kochi.

Theatrical ""arrest""

The agency accosted Mr. Sivasankar immediately after news broke that the Kerala High Court had rejected his plea for anticipatory bail.

A phalanx of news reporters and television camera persons had staked out in front of the hospital anticipating Mr. Sivasankar's imminent arrest.

The embattled bureaucrat appeared stoic and refused to answer questions from journalists as he emerged from the hospital flanked by plainclothes officers. The ED agents soon whisked him away in their official car to their office in Kochi.

NIA role

The decision of the National Investigation Agency in July to investigate the gold smuggling case under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, had set in motion a chain of events that rocked the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government.

Mr Sivasankar was reckoned widely as the face of the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) and Mr Vijayan's close confidant. The recurrently televised optics of the ED taking him into custody appeared not to have augured well for the public image of the government. They also seemed to have catalysed the demand of the Congress and the Bharathiya Janata Party (BJP) for the resignation of Mr Vijayan.

PMLA and UAPA angles

The ED suspected that Mr. Sivasankar had helped gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh conceal the vast proceeds from the crime in bank lockers and accounts. Swapna had allegedly spirited away a part of the booty to Dubai in foreign currency, and Mr Sivasankar had accompanied her on some of the trips.

The ED believed that the illegal profits were ploughed back into the gold smuggling operation headed by persons with suspicious links to radical organisations in the country and abroad.

Hence, the agency wanted to question him under sections 16, 17 and 18 of the UAPA. The provisions relate to raising funds, directly or indirectly, for anti-national activities and include offences that imperil the economic security of the country.

The illegal acts under the UAPA are also ""scheduled"" offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The official said ED would examine whether Mr. Sivasankar's ""level of culpability"", if at all, in the matter. So far, neither the ED nor the Customs has registered a case against Mr. Sivasankar. He continued to be a person of interest.

The NIA has evinced interest in examining Mr. Sivasankar's interrogation report to find out whether it revealed any cognisable offence under the provisions of the UAPA.

Demand for CM's resignation

Mr. Sivasankar's detention seemed to have further catalysed the demand of the Congress and the Bharathiya Janata Party (BJP) for Mr Vijayan's resignation. Both parties have sworn to revive aggressive street protests if Mr. Vijayan refused to stepdown.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that Mr. Sivasankar had merely done Mr. Vijayan's bidding. The CM could not absolve himself of the crime. Mr. Vijayan had allowed Mr Sivasankar to use the heft of his office to aid economic offenders and anti-nationals. He had lost the moral right to continue in office.

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullapally Ramachandran and P. K. Krishnadas, national general secretary of the BJP, demanded that Mr. Vijayan resign immediately. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) was yet to react to the development.

Govt rejects demand

Law Minister A. K. Balan said there was no ground or precedent for the Chief Minister to resign because a former bureaucrat attached to his office was under a cloud of suspicion. The government had requested the NIA to probe the case. It had extended full support to the Central agencies. Congress and BJP were attempting to politicise the issue ahead of the local body elections by laying down a smokescreen of lies to cast the government under a cloud of suspicion. The opposition wanted to eclipse the achievements of the LDF government, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wl7vzh/article32962706.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sivasankar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gold-smuggling-case-suspended-ias-officer-m-sivasankar-taken-into-ed-custody/article32961380.ece
157,2020/10/28,Money laundering case: ED questions IUML leader,"Ebrahim Kunju is accused of depositing unaccounted money into two bank accounts of party mouthpiece Chandrika in Kochi on November 15, 2016

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday began quizzing V.K. Ebrahim Kunju, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader and MLA representing Kalamassery constituency, over allegations of money laundering against him.

Mr. Kunju, former Minister for Public Works in the United Democratic Front government during 2011-16, is accused of depositing about ₹10 crore into the bank account of his party’s mouthpiece Chandrika daily when high-value currency notes of ₹500 and ₹1,000 were banned by the Centre in November, 2016. The questioning of the MLA is being held at the ED’s office here.

The Kerala High Court had asked the agency to probe the case in response to a public interest litigation petition filed by Kalamassery-native Girish Babu seeking an investigation against Mr. Kunju for alleged money laundering. The petitioner had alleged that unaccounted money was transferred into two bank accounts of Chandrika in Kochi on November 15, 2016.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Customs had vehemently opposed the former bureaucrat’s application in the UAE Consulate-linked gold smuggling case.

During the argument of the case earlier, the ED had submitted that Mr. Sivasankar was the kingpin in the case and “all the strings were in his hands”.

160,2020/10/28,State gears up to tackle post-COVID syndrome,"Measures being explored by Health dept. include telemedicine to self-monitoring and reporting

The Health Department is in the process of drawing up a protocol for following up an ever increasing pool – which has already crossed three lakh now – of persons who have recovered from COVID-19 but who might be experiencing “long COVID” or the post-COVID syndrome, which could in some cases be life-threatening or just debilitating.

“It is a long road to recovery after COVID-19 and even those who had asymptomatic or mild disease could be experiencing a range of multisystemic manifestations such as chronic fatigue, sleep disorders, short-term memory loss or brain fog. We have been following up a cohort of some 400 health-care workers who had contracted the infection. Our estimation is that while about 10% of the patients experience “long COVID”, which lasts typically for about three weeks, about 2% will go on to experience chronic post-COVID syndrome lasting over three months,” R. Aravind, Head of Infectious Diseases, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, says.

However, screening and management of the unmanageable number of recovered patients is posing a major challenge for the Health Department . It is exploring all possibilities from telemedicine to self-monitoring and reporting, so that the focus remains on picking up those patients who might experience life-threatening or chronic post-COVID syndrome. “Most of the extra-pulmonary complications of COVID manifest after day 10, when the patient would have been discharged. Clinicians should ensure that a patient has been clinically stable for the past two days and not just antigen negative when he is discharged,’’ Dr. Aravind says.

The priority of post-COVID clinics should be in the early identification of patients who experience palpitation or dyspnoea, and getting them into pulmonary rehabilitation, with anti-fibrotic drugs if needed.

“The last thing we want is for those with mild post-COVID issues to crowd at these clinics, which could then turn out to be another hub of virus transmission,” a senior health official says.

Algorithmic approach

The Health Department is drawing up an algorithmic approach to manage these issues in primary care clinics, from where patients can be screened and referred to specialists.

“All patients at the time of discharge itself should be educated about post-COVID syndrome and taught self-monitoring and report back to doctors. They should be trained in breathing exercise to increase the efficiency of respiratory muscles which have been weakened by COVID-19,” Dr. Aravind says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/n24ofl/article32958649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tval3--backwater,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-gears-up-to-tackle-post-covid-syndrome/article32958650.ece
161,2020/10/28,Bridging the language gap,"The use of blended learning and technology could help build a robust population of English speakers

English has become imperative for anyone wanting to enter the knowledge-driven global job economy. Not only can better communication skills provide better job opportunities, it can also help existing employees grow and climb the corporate ladder.

A simple online search reveals just one online job portal lists almost 250,000 jobs available that require English skills. Sectors such as technology, education, KPO, hospitality, advertising, and others want to hire employees who can articulate well in English, making English proficiency a critical 21st century skill. A recent report by Michael & Susan Dell Foundation and consulting firm, Sattva, found that English proficiency was a non-negotiable for 73% of job roles; 20% job roles categorised English as a ‘good to have’; while only 7% roles did not need fluency in English.

Learning gap

While privileged urban dwellers might argue that English is widely spoken in the country, the numbers tell a completely different story. The last census in India revealed that only 3% of rural citizens and 12% of urban citizens have the ability to speak in English.

The good news is that Indian families are realising the gamut of opportunities that spoken English skills present. This is evident in the trend of more students in urban cities moving to English-medium private schools. This essentially means there is a willingness among the underprivileged to pay to get access to English learning. Today, almost 40% students enrol in affordable private schools, and this is expected to increase to 60% by 2022.

However, while such affordable private schools provide educational prospects for children the standard of English education is not at par with premium private schools. Students at low-cost private schools are typically 2-3 levels behind appropriate grade competencies in English, leading to unequal access and missed opportunities.

Technology can be a catalyst

Can technology be a key enabler in providing access to quality English education? The answer is a resounding ‘yes’. With traditional learning facing challenges such as dearth of good teachers, lack of infrastructure, and fragmentation, technology can help level the playing field. In addition to providing access, online tools can make learning more engaging, efficient and effective.

There are quite a few technology-enabled solutions available in the market but they fail to deliver the desired impact at scale. This is because most offer a one-size-fits-all product without focussing on individual needs. Some focus only on self-learning and lack conversational practice, which is fundamental to English learning. Additionally, not being linked to employment outcomes hinder their effectiveness.

Blended learning

The results of the Sattva study on “Evaluating effectiveness of technology in improving spoken English” showed that blended learning can overcome the hurdles most traditional schools and online learning platforms face. Blended learning refers to a combination of tech-led self-learning combined with a high quality instructor led training. It brings the benefits of both online learning materials, as well as an interactive classroom.

The current pandemic has reshaped the job economy. With employees across the world working remotely, businesses will soon widen their reach and tap into the global talent pool. Good communication skills in the workplace will become even more crucial.

Netflix is collaborating with gaming company Ubisoft for a live-action series on popular video game “Assassin’s Creed.”

In a statement, Netflix and Ubisoft announced that they will develop a slate of properties based on the best-selling game.

The first series has been described as an “epic, genre-bending live-action adaptation” and the two companies are currently searching for a showrunner.

The “Assassin’s Creed” franchise launched in 2007 and has since sold more than 155 million games worldwide.

It depicts an ancient world struggle between the Assassins and their power-hunger rivals the Templars, and weave its drama through historical events and figures.

163,2020/10/28,An app to celebrate the writings of P Lankesh launched,"Director Indrajit Lankesh is on a mission to convert the works of his father into audio podcasts

The late P Lankesh needs no introduction . In fact, he took the world of Kannada writing by storm in the ‘70s and ‘80s, not to forget the famed tabloid Lankesh Patrike, which was a household name. He has also left his mark in the Kannada film industry with the National Award-winning film, Pallavi.

Now, his son, Indrajit Lankesh has come up with an app to celebrate his father’s writings. Simply called Lankesh, the app will be officially launched on November 1. The app will feature all the works of Lankesh in an audio format.

Indrajit’s mission is to make his father’s literary works reach the present generation. “The digital format is to get the younger generation to know his works. I believe my father’s writings are contemporary. Till date, the sales show that his books are one of the highest selling books in Kannada literature. And, he wrote intensely for almost three decades!” says Indrajit.

Then he explains the reason for launching this app with, “Youngsters today are into the audio and visual medium. I also believe that the habit of reading books has almost disintegrated. The Lankesh App is aimed to make the works of my father known to those who want to know more about Kannada literature, but do not have the inclination to read books.”

Lankesh’s writings include novels, plays and poetry. Some of his popular works are Kallu Karaguva Samaya Mattu Ithara Kathegalu, Hulimavina Mara and Sankranti to name a few.

Till date around 10 books of his have been translated to audio books and has voice overs by actors like Suchendra Prasad. “I am a huge fan of his voice and Suchendra is not just a part of the audio pod cast, but I make it a point that he be a part of every film that I make,” shares Indrajit, who then adds that apart from the voices of celebrities, the podcasts also include voices of dubbing artistes.

Besides the works of Lankesh, Indrajit also reveals that the app will soon bring the works of other Kannada writers too. “The plan is to include biographies of Dr Vishnuvardhan, Ravichandran , Shankar Nag — some of which were published by Lankesh Patrike. Later works of writers like Siddalingaiah, Poornachandra Tejasvi also are in the pipeline,” adds Indrajit, who is a film director too. His Bollywood film, Shakeela, featuring Richa Chadda and Pankaj Tripathi is almost set for a release. “The Hindi film is also dubbed in all the four south Indian languages and we plan to release it in theatres soon.”

Coming back to the Lankesh app, he states that the app is free and will be available on Google Play.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ft3dld/article32963349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGMLANKESH2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/an-app-to-celebrate-the-writings-of-p-lankesh-launched/article32963350.ece
164,2020/10/28,‘It is tough to convince producers and actors to be a part of the stories I want to say’: Bejoy Nambiar,"Filmmaker Bejoy Nambiar discusses his new film ‘Taish’, which is set to make a simultaneous release as a film and a web series

Try asking a creative mind to shoehorn his work of art in a style that suits the audience’s perception of his idea, chances are that you will be met with a response similar to Bejoy Nambiar’s. “If I had to distill [the film], then yeah... Taish is a revenge drama,” the 41-year-old filmmaker says, when asked to classify his upcoming film’s genre.

“I’m a big fan of the drama genre. I’m also a fan of human [centric] stories. I tend to gravitate towards these ideas when I write. Taish is an example. It has action, it is set in the format of a thriller, but at the core of it, the film is a human [centric] story and tackles serious issues (sic),” he adds, over phone from his Mumbai residence.

Cut from the same cloth

Starring Pulkit Samrat, Kriti Kharbanda, Jim Sarbh, Harshvardhan Rane and Abhimanyu Singh among others, Taish is set to make a simultaneous release as a film and a six-episode web series on ZEE5 on October 29. It follows the story of two warring families and a past incident that comes to haunt them. “A cycle of violence and revenge starts and there is seemingly no tangible end,” Bejoy notes.

While he shot Taish as a feature film, the idea to make a separate cut and package it as a web series became possible after lockdown. Bejoy had screened a rough cut to a test audience prior. Feedback indicated a preference to watch the content as web series, but the filmmaker only acted on it after the pandemic outbreak. “The lockdown really helped because the film’s editor [Priyank Prem Kumar] and I were able to revisit the material. We first did a three-episode version and then cut it down further to six episodes,” he says.

Netflix début Bejoy, who has assisted Mani Ratnam in the past, returned to work in that capacity for his mentor’s magnum opus directorial, Ponniyin Selvan. Production on the film, which features an ensemble cast, had to be put on hold due to the pandemic outbreak, but it is now speculated that filming is likely to resume in November or December 2020.

While Bejoy is expected to rejoin Ponniyin Selvan crew, the filmmaker remarks that he, meanwhile, is likely to finish work on a Netflix project starring Madhuri Dixit, which is bankrolled by Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions. “I’m about to direct four episodes,” he says.



Bejoy points out that the web series is not a chopped down version of the film. “It is a different kind of edit, and in terms of viewing experience, both the film and the web series would be different,” he says, adding, “In a way, this empowers the audience to choose the format in which they want to watch Taish, which is a novel way of presenting the content.”

Known for his unique stories in David, Shaitan and the Dulquer Salmaan-starrer Solo, Bejoy has, in the past, been vocal of ‘his struggles’ to bring his vision to reality. “I find it a challenge to convince producers and actors to come on board the kind of stories I want to say. I want to work with people who let me realise my film the way I want it,” he says.

Ensemble trouble

His track record also indicates a penchant for making multi-starrer films, although, suffice to say, it is not easy.

“[Multi-starrers] have become an alien concept. Even a two hero subject is so difficult to cast. The idea I get from producers and directors is that it is almost a crime to write an ensemble subject. You have two or three multi-starrers in the comedy genre every year but in thrillers and drama, none at all,” says Bejoy, adding, “I think insecurity of the artiste is one main reason, but also there isn’t enough conviction shown by artistes on the story and the maker.”

But for someone who is not always dealt the hand he desires, Bejoy is not short on optimism. For instance, his desire to make a feature film with Mohanlal and Mammootty — “both together in the same film if possible”, he says — has not faded. Bejoy’s début short film, Reflections, featured Mohanlal. “Mammootty and Mohanlal are the heroes that I grew up watching. It is their cinema that inspired people like me to join films. I did go to Lal sir with a Malayalam subject but it didn’t work out. I ended up making it as a one hour short film later on, but there still is time,” he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tjuejq/article32963317.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bejoy-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/it-is-tough-to-convince-producers-and-actors-to-be-a-part-of-the-stories-i-want-to-say-bejoy-nambiar/article32963322.ece
165,2020/10/28,‘This is a love story’: Makers of Netflix documentary 'Rooting for Roona',"How Pavitra Chalam and Akshay Shankar conceived a documentary that narrates the story of a baby battling hydrocephalus

Seven years ago, when Pavitra Chalam was researching for a project, she stumbled upon a photograph that was arresting, almost unreal. It was of a baby girl with a 36-inch head (double the usual size). Pavitra, a documentary filmmaker who tells stories of children with complex needs, felt compelled to know more about this baby, Roona Begum, from a little village, Jirania Khala, in Tripura. Pavitra and her co-filmmaker, Akshay Shankar, decided that it would be their next. With their team they left from Bengaluru to a hospital in Delhi, where Roona was awaiting surgery with her parents.

This was how the documentary short Rooting for Roona, now streaming on Netflix, began. It was screened at the International Documentary and Short Film Festival of Kerala, Tryon Film Festival in North Carolina and South Asian Film Festival of Orlando. It was also one of six films chosen by the Women in Film Finishing Film grant in 2019.

The baby’s photograph had captured the attention of national and international media. Roona and hydrocephalus (a condition, wherein cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in brain cavities, enlarging the head) were a hot topic. The toddler had a successful surgery. With that, the media frenzy ended. But Pavitra, Akshay and their team decided to be with Roona and her family. An assistant director, Ananya Roy, spoke their dialect and acted as a liaison between the family and doctors, media among others. Roona’s battle with hydrocephalus was not over. No one knew if or when it would.

Sudden heartbreak

“Usually, for a documentary, you can pre-empt certain things and make a plan. But in this case, right from day one, we had to tell ourselves anything can happen,” says Akshay.

“The end we had in mind was seeing her walk. That was everyone’s dream,” adds Pavitra.

However, it was not a fairytale. Roona passed away in 2017 when she was five and a half. “It was devastating. She was a month away from one more surgery that might have cured her,” says Pavitra.

Rooting for Roona, however, is neither a sob-story nor a documentary about hydrocephalus itself. “Every living day was a hard-won victory for Roona and her young parents [Fatima Khatun and Abdul Rahman]. She was living on impossibility,” says Pavitra. The documentary, hence, is a tale of inspiration, she adds.

A love story

The makers say that Rooting for Roona, without doubt, is their toughest project. It was, in many ways, also their most memorable.

“We are a small production house. So, it was difficult to get funding, assemble a team. But we got a lot of support from within the team and outside,” says Akshay, “We had to beg, borrow, steal to stay in the dingiest of places so that we could spend another day with the family.”

For Pavitra, the documentary is more personal. She was pregnant during the post-production phase, a few months after Roona’s death. “In a way, Roona was my first child. The nine months of pregnancy coincided with the film’s post-production,” she says, “I also spent a lot of time with Fatima. I could understand deeply her feelings for Roona. This documentary… it is a love story between a mother and daughter; a love story between us and this little girl.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/1mwh1c/article32962943.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Roona3JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/this-is-a-love-story-makers-of-netflix-documentary-rooting-for-roona/article32962944.ece
166,2020/10/28,Not lost in translation: Why the Hindi dubbed versions of South Indian films are in demand,"There is a growing interest for Hindi dubbed versions of Tamil and Telugu, prompting film distributors to satiate an audience deprived of ‘masala content’

The lockdown might have allowed film buffs to discover regional films on digital platforms, but interest in dubbed cinema from the South, particularly Telugu and Tamil films, too, has been mushrooming in parallel.

This is not a recent phenomena. The 2018-19 report published by Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), India, about the viewership percentage for films from the South on television, states that Hindi channels relied on dubbed films for “at least 11% of the viewership”. The report adds that films in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam languages “clocked at least 135 billion hours” of viewership.

Love for the masala

What explains the growing audience for dubbed content up North? Umesh Gupta, managing director of Aditya Movies, goes back 14 years to recollect how dubbed content only had a “small theatrical market” then. Today, his company uploads dubbed Hindi movies to its YouTube channel. “We now have the advantage of satellite, television and digital platforms,” he says.

There was a time in the ‘90s and early noughties when Bollywood churned out ‘masala films’ starring the likes of Sunny Deol and Sanjay Dutt. These films, which occupied prime time slots, gradually diminished in numbers with the emergence of content deemed ‘multiplex-friendly’.

It is this dearth of commercial potboilers that prompted distributors like Aneesh Dev, managing director, WAM India (a pioneer in film distribution) to venture into the dubbing business. He bought the rights of sought-after Telugu and Tamil films, dubbed and presented them to non-native speakers. That was until Rajinikanth’s 2005 film, Chandramukhi, whose dubbed version was lapped up by the Hindi speaking audience, woke Aneesh up to the untapped potential of ‘masala films’.

Numbers game The 2017 Telugu film Ninnu Kori starring Nani, Aadhi Pinisetty and Nivetha Thomas, has been uploaded to YouTube by Aditya Movies as Aaj Ka Khiladi. It has gained 18 million views in less than a month.

The Hindi-dubbed version of Tamil film Action starring Vishal and Tamannaah Bhatia — a film which underperformed critically and commercially upon release — has 74 million views on YouTube in under three weeks of its upload.

Vijay’s Jilla dubbed as Policewala Gunda 2 and Bairavaa have 123 million and 100 million each, Dhanush’s Maari 2 and Vada Chennai garnered 93 and 30 million, while Karthi’s Dev and Sivakarthikeyan’s Remo have 79 and 77 million views.

The Hindi version of Telugu film iSmart Shankar has 138 million views, Majili has 73 million views and the 2018 film Srinivasa Kalyanam has 136 million views on YouTube.

“Television channels used to screen old movies of Chiranjeevi and Nagarjuna in the 2000s. But the major shift happened with Chandramukhi, whose Hindi rights we had bought. Thereafter, we started looking at Telugu and Tamil films more,” says Aneesh, over phone from Mumbai. He observes that the popularity of dubbed movies from the South has grown at such an exponential rate that when presented with an opportunity, he launched an exclusive streaming platform for such films. Called Dollywood Play, which went live in July this year.

Plus or minus

According to Aneesh, dubbed movies are categorised in two verticals: A plus and A minus. The former includes star vehicles while the latter category features films headlined by mid-tier actors.

“We don’t opt for A plus because it is difficult to recover the money. A minus is a safer zone and the price will not fluctuate,” he adds. In most cases, distributors acquire the Hindi dubbing rights from a producer and dub on their own, as opposed to buying the rights of an already dubbed film. They have a team of writers — who work on the script and dialogues — and dubbing artists, which has become a separate industry altogether.

“We prefer it this way because we are able to supervise quality. Dubbing into vernacular languages is a market that is emerging,” says Aneesh.

One of the contributing factors to this preference for ‘masala films’ among the audience is the way action sequences are choreographed in South films, says SR Prabhu, partner, Dream Warrior Pictures production firm. “Action scenes in our movies are superior to the ones you would find in Bollywood. In fact, when a distributor approaches us for the Hindi rights, the first question he asks is: ‘how many action blocks does the film have?’,”he says.

Umesh Gupta shares a similar train of thought. “The Hindi-speaking audience love the one-liners that we call ‘punch dialogues’, the comedy and action sequences,” he says, adding that recent years have witnessed a demand for non-action films as well, such as Telugu director Trivikram Srinivas’ A… Aa, starring Nithiin and Samantha Akkineni. “The dubbed version of A... Aa got 200 million views,” he adds.

Same with the Tamil social-drama, Raatchasi, which was dubbed and released as Madam Geeta Rani by Goldmines Telefilms on their YouTube channel. In under a month, it had amassed 100 million views. Prabhu, who is Raatchasi’s producer, says that the film performed better on digital platforms than during its theatrical run. Its dubbing rights fetched his company nearly the same revenue as satellite and digital streaming rights.

Aneesh explains that there are two types of market; original and the other language market. A critically-acclaimed film that has done decent business in the original market does not necessarily mean it would do well in the dubbed market and vice versa.

Take the Telugu film Srinivasa Kalyanam, for instance. The film elicited a lukewarm response in theatres, but found more takers online. Director Satish Vegesna admits that he was pleasantly surprised when the film crossed 135 million views: “During the lockdown, families were homebound; people looked for content without cuss words and vulgarity. When we released in Telugu, the younger audience didn’t like the film; some said that it looked like a wedding video,” he reasons, “However, going through the comments on YouTube I learnt that those in the northern states were looking for movies that reflected Indian culture.”

Thriving business

What is the demography of the audience watching dubbed movies online? Aneesh brings in a Bharat–India analogy to explain this phenomenon, “In marketing lingo, we have something called Bharat and India. The latter is for the urban audience, which has an upward mobility and which can shell out ₹600/700 for an OTT subscription,” he says, adding, “Bharat is where the majority of population is and that is our audiences, who are primarily from tier-2 or 3 cities.”

The class difference should also be taken into consideration. Prabhu says that dubbed films resonate more with people from economically-backward sections, who prefer watching movies in their vernacular languages.

“There is a whole section of the audience that does not watch movies with subtitles. When someone from an underprivileged background watches a dubbed film, (s)he is able to relate to the emotions, even if they don’t know understand the film’s original language,” he says.

Localisation is also one of the reasons why streaming players have started to dub their content now. Netflix dubbed the Spanish show Money Heist into English for those who did not want to read subtitles; the South Korean Academy Award-winning film Parasite is now available in Hindi on Amazon Prime whilst a host of Marvel movies on Disney+ Hotstar is available in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam.

Lately, YouTube has opened a new source of revenue for producers and distributors, whereby the latter monetises the viewership numbers based on the ads generated for the content. Prabhu, however, feels that this revenue is meagre. “If your movie crosses 100 million views, you might end up making ₹1 crore on YouTube; it is a small model,” he says, and adds: “That is why producers prefer selling the Hindi remake rights because it fetches more money.”

Vishal’s ‘Action’ has gained over 75 million views on YouTube | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Aneesh, however, believes the dubbing industry is here to thrive. “In our country, 80% of the audience likes masala and the remaining watch all kinds of content. It is not a question of what is sensible, but what works. So, when it comes to business, I am only concerned about what the majority likes because that is only bringing money.”

167,2020/10/28,‘Rebecca’ review: An underwhelming reboot of the classic gothic romance,"The reasons for this dull remake seem remarkably well-hidden behind the gorgeous production values and great-looking cast

There must have been some logic for this remake. Someone must have thought it a good idea to remake Alfred Hitchcock’s 1940 adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier’s Rebecca (1938), which incidentally won the Best Picture at the 13th Academy Awards. The reasons for this dull reboot seem remarkably well-hidden behind the gorgeous production values and great-looking cast.

The novel tells the story of a naïve young girl who is swept off her feet by an older man, Maxim De Winter. She marries and comes to live with him in Manderley, the grand family house by the windswept sea in Cornwall. In Manderley, the girl quickly realises the shadow of Rebecca, the first Mrs De Winter, lies over everything. Rebecca seems to have been perfect — beloved, beautiful, witty and sophisticated.

The second Mrs De Winter (the protagonist is not named) feels more and more inadequate and matters are not helped by the housekeeper, the sinister Mrs Danvers, who does not lose any opportunity to show how inept she is compared to the accomplished Rebecca. Matters come to a head when Rebecca’s boat is found at the bottom of the ocean and the mystery of her death is solved.

Rebecca Director: Ben Wheatley

Cast: Lily James, Armie Hammer, Kristin Scott Thomas, Tom Goodman-Hill, Keeley Hawes, Sam Riley, Ann Dowd

Story line: A young newlywed arrives at her husband’s family estate, and finds herself battling the shadow of his first wife Rebecca, whose legacy lives on in the house long after her death

Run time: 121 minutes

The 1940 version had Sir Laurence Olivier as De Winter, Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs De Winter and Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers. There was also a mini-series in 1997 with Charles Dance as De Winter and Bond girl Diana Rigg (she played Teresa, Bond’s wife for a few hours in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service) as Mrs. Danvers.

Ben Wheatley’s Rebecca starts like every other version with “Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.” Wonder if the iambic pentameter made any effect on breathy Ms Lily James who plays the unnamed protagonist. The movie then goes back to the golden days in Monte Carlo where the young girl meets the aristocratic widower, De Winter (Armie Hammer). They marry and come to Manderley only to be met by chilly Mrs Danvers —Kristin Scott Thomas gnashing her teeth and glowering in vain. It would have been easier to stop Golitsyn from stealing the NOC list in Mission Impossible than salvage anything from this movie.

The 2020 version does nothing new — it does not explore Danvers’ obsession with Rebecca, nor does it throw any light on Rebecca herself, who tragically seems to have been a millennial before her time. It doesn’t even try to give the second Mrs De Winter a first name! The only change from the earlier versions is reverting to the novel’s version of events for Rebecca’s death, which does not add anything to the movie.

Beautifully shot and handsomely produced, this 2020 iteration of the Gothic classic would struggle long and hard in vain to free itself of Rebecca’s shadow.

The plot revolves around a woman who, to ease the pain after tragically losing her fiance, starts to send romantic texts to his old cell. It turns out that the phone number has been reassigned to a man across town suffering from similar heartbreak.

The two meet and feel an undeniable connection, but can’t seem to leave the past behind.

In the remake, the music and influence of Dion, known for her Oscar winning love ballad “My Heart Will Go On” from “Titanic” and other inspirational songs like “The Power of Love”, gives them the courage to take a chance on love again.

Basil Iwanyk, Erica Lee, and Esther Hornstein are producing the film for Thunder Road, the banner behind films like “A Star is Born” and “John Wick”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/hlczc/article32961740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AP9112019000006B,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/priyanka-chopra-to-star-alongside-celine-dion-in-romantic-drama/article32961741.ece
172,2020/10/28,Director Seenu Ramasamy claims threat to life over ‘800’ biopic fallout,"The director, known for his films starring Vijay Sethupathi, who walked out of the biopic following opposition, alleged attempts were being made to drive a wedge between him and the actor

In what seems to be a fallout of the controversy over Sri Lankan cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan’s biopic ‘800’, Tamil cinema director Seenu Ramasamy on Wednesday alleged that he was receiving threats and appealed to Chief Minister K Palaniswami for help.

The director, known for critically acclaimed films starring Vijay Sethupathi, who walked out of the biopic following opposition, alleged attempts were being made to drive a wedge between him and the actor.

The duo have dished out well-received films ‘Thenmerku Paruvakatru’ and ‘Dharmadurai’ and is currently engaged in their next project, ‘Maamanithan.’

Ramasamy was among the Tamil celebrities who voiced concern against Sethupathi reprising the record breaking cricketer’s silver screen role.

On Wednesday, Ramasamy took to Twitter and said “I feel I have a threat to my life.”

“CM sir should help. Urgent,” he said in the short Tamil tweet.

Later, speaking to reporters, he said during the height of the controversy, Sethupathi had told him the production house behind the biopic itself had volunteered to withdraw.

The “issue was over,” Ramasamy said, adding, he later also met Sethupathi.

He had earlier expressed his “anguish” to Sethupathi over the matter privately as well as publicly in the interest of the actor but “an image is created that I am against him.”

“Vijay Sethupathi is loved by Tamils all over the world, including Elam Tamils (in Sri Lanka). But (an impression is being created) as if I gave a statement (against the actor). I am receiving whatsapp calls in the night, besides SMSes,” he said.

“They (the callers) are intimidating me... im receiving threats,” he said, adding, abusive language was also being used by “unknown elements.”

He said many Tamils, including creative artistes, “only requested” Sethupathi not to feature in the movie and that nobody was harsh on him.

“Some are trying to create a wedge between me and Vijay Sethupathi,” he said and denied the callers could have been the actor’s fans, saying they were like his “younger brothers.”

To a question, he said Sethupathi was aware of the issue and asked him not to worry about it.

Ramasamy said he would prefer a police complaint over the matter.

Sethupathi had pulled out of the biopic ‘800’ on October 19 in the wake of stiff opposition to his essaying Muralitharan’s role in the film, even as the cricketer himself requested the star to walk out of the project.

The ruling AIADMK had wanted the actor to reconsider his decision to act in the movie, even as political parties, including the MDMK and PMK and veteran director Bharathirajaa were among those who had urged Sethupathi to dissociate from the biopic.

They had alleged that Muralitharan was a ‘betrayer’ of the Tamil people and supported the then Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa during the 2009 civil war.

The cricketer had responded saying he never supported the killings of innocent people and would never do that.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/5dpxje/article32961706.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/seenu,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/director-seenu-ramasamy-claims-threat-to-life-over-800-biopic-fallout/article32961707.ece
173,2020/10/28,Kazakhstan taps new ‘Borat’ movie to woo tourists,"Authorities in the country have adopted Borat’s catchphrase “Very Nice!” to try to promote tourism in the vast Central Asian country

Ridiculed once again in a film featuring fictional Kazakh journalist Borat Sagdiyev, the ex-Soviet state of Kazakhstan has embraced the joke this time round and adopted Borat’s catch phrase to try to attract tourists.

“Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,” a follow-up to a 2006 film featuring the same sexist and racist character, was released on Amazon Prime last week.

Like the first film, the movie has Borat on the rampage in the United States where he tries to trick U.S. politicians and others into letting their guard down and compromising themselves.

Borat’s first outing caused anger in Kazakhstan where authorities discouraged its screening and threatened legal action over what they saw as an insult to their national character.

This time round, they have taken a different approach and adopted Borat’s catchphrase “Very Nice!” to try to promote tourism in the vast Central Asian country.

In a slick video released by the tourism board featuring spectacular mountains and lakes, an exotic food market, and futuristic-looking cityscapes, a series of foreign tourists use the catch phrase to signal their appreciation for what they are seeing.

The idea to use Borat’s catch phrase belongs to Dennis Keen, a U.S. citizen living in Kazakhstan, who is married to a Kazakh woman and has a business running walking tours.

“It was something I’d been thinking about for years as everyone who comes here is aware of the Borat thing being attached to the country’s brand,” Keen told Reuters.

Borat’s “Very Nice!” catch phase could be put to good use instead, he said.

“It’s actually the perfect description of the country in the most sincere way. The people and the food are very nice.”

COVID-19 means tourism in Kazakhstan has been hard hit by travel restrictions and border closures like many other countries.

But Kairat Sadvakassov, Deputy Chairman of Kazakh Tourism, said he hoped the campaign would help people see that Borat’s jokes about the country were off target when the situation improved.

“We would like everyone to come experience Kazakhstan for themselves by visiting our country in 2021 and beyond, so that they can see that Borat’s homeland is nicer than they may have heard, Sadvakassov said in a news release.

Still, Kazakh authorities remain unimpressed with the film.

In a statement issued by the foreign ministry on Saturday, officials said the new movie was racist and xenophobic, but that an official protest was pointless because it would only generate more publicity and profits for the film’s makers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/k3m54m/article32961589.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/borat,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kazakhstan-taps-new-borat-movie-to-woo-tourists/article32961590.ece
174,2020/10/28,Cannes rolls out red carpet for short film showcase,"Organisers of its famed cinema festival, cancelled earlier this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, kicked off a more low-key three-day event

Movie-lovers got a turn on the red carpet at Cannes on Tuesday night as the organisers of its famed cinema festival, cancelled earlier this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, kicked off a more low-key three-day event showcasing a range of short films.

Usually awash with Hollywood stars who flock to the French city’s “Croisette” promenade for the two-week extravaganza in May, Cannes was a much quieter version of its glamorous self, with even some major hotels deciding to shut up shop.

But organisers said they had wanted to hold an event all the same, despite enduring travel restrictions, to shine a light on some films and give a boost to the cinema industry, hit hard by coronavirus lockdowns.

“It’s a reunion of friends,” said Cannes Film Festival President Pierre Lescure. The event on France’s southern coast is the world’s biggest cinema showcase, and also a major market for the industry.

Members of the public were invited to register for tickets. Four films that would have been part of the official main competition in May will be shown, while several short movies will compete for a prize.

Wearing face masks, and long gowns in some cases, guests wound their way up a red carpet to one of the auditoriums.

“We need to live in Cannes,” said attendee and local resident Arlette Destouches. “We’re here for that, to live, not to fall asleep.”

Lescure said Cannes’ organisers were already thinking of options to move the festival dates next year if it could not take place as usual in May.

“We have already planned one or two possible dates that have been pushed back to June or July. But Cannes 2021 will happen,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3nrct9/article32961624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1282546717,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cannes-rolls-out-red-carpet-for-short-film-showcase/article32961547.ece
175,2020/10/28,Comedian Jon Stewart to return to TV on Apple TV Plus,"The former ‘Daily Show’ host will host and produce a new current affairs series for Apple Inc’s streaming television service

Former “Daily Show” host Jon Stewart will host and produce a new current affairs series for Apple Inc’s streaming television service, the company announced on Tuesday.

The multi-season series on Apple TV+ will bring the comedian back to TV on a regular basis for the first time since he ended his Emmy-winning run as host of “The Daily Show” in 2015.

No debut date for the untitled series was announced. Apple said in a statement that each one-hour episode would address a single issue and explore topics related to current events and Stewart’s advocacy work.

The issues also will be discussed in a companion podcast, the company said.

Stewarts irreverent brand of political and media satire made him a beloved figure on television with influence far beyond the 2 to 3 million nightly audience of “The Daily Show” on Comedy Central.

Since leaving the “Daily Show,” Stewart has appeared occasionally on talk shows and this year released a political comedy film called “Irresistible” that he wrote and directed.

He also has advocated for wounded veterans and for healthcare benefits for first responders who became ill after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He and his wife, Tracey, opened a farm sanctuary in New Jersey.

Stewart’s new series is part of a multi-year agreement with Apple to develop and produce projects for Apple TV+, a $5-a-month competitor to subscription video services from companies such as Netflix Inc and Walt Disney Co .

In 2015, Stewart had signed a deal with AT&T Inc’s HBO network for a short-form animated series for digital platforms, but that project was scrapped.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/cu15sb/article32961535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TVJONSTEWART,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/comedian-jon-stewart-to-return-to-tv-on-apple-tv-plus/article32961536.ece
176,2020/10/28,"‘Navarasa’: Mani Ratnam, Suriya headline host of talent part of new Netflix anthology","The nine-film anthology has been conceptualised as an initiative that will raise funds to support those in the cinema industry who have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis

Netflix on Tuesday announced its next Tamil anthology, Navarasa. The nine-film anthology is based on the nine rasas (emotions) of anger, compassion, courage, disgust, fear, laughter, love, peace and wonder.

The anthology of short films was conceived by directors Mani Ratnam and Jayendra Panchapakesan (co-founder, Qube Cinema) as an initiative that will raise funds to support those in the cinema industry who have been acutely affected by the COVID-19 crisis.

Navarasa brings together the finest talent of the Tamil film industry. In this anthology, nine filmmakers Arvind Swami (in his directorial debut), Bejoy Nambiar, Gautham Vasudev Menon, Karthik Subbaraj, Karthick Naren, KV Anand, Ponram, Rathindran Prasad and Halitha Shameem lend their incredible talent to bring their distinctive perspective on each rasa.

The nine short films feature a stellar line up of over 40 cast members and several hundred creative and film technicians.

The anthology will star a host of top-line talent such as Suriya, Arvind Swami, Vijay Sethupathi, Revathy, Nithya Menen, Parvathy, Aishwarya Rajessh, Poorna, Rythvika, Prakash Raj, Siddharth, Gautham Karthik, Ashok Selvan and many others.

The creative community of Tamil cinema has united to send a strong message of solidarity and resilience and graciously offer their services pro-bono. They will contribute the proceeds from the films towards the well-being of film workers in Tamil cinema impacted by the pandemic.

Speaking on this collaboration, Mani Ratnam and Jayendra Panchapakesan said, “We have always loved to brainstorm and come up with unique ideas to raise money for deserving causes. This time the brainstorming was for the cause of our own industry, to soothe and try and alleviate to some extent the agony of our people who had no work for months. The idea of making short films and raising money through them for this cause was born on one such brainstorming evening. We were thrilled when the idea resonated well instantly with leading directors, actors and technicians of the industry that we approached.”

The directors part of ‘Navarasa’

They added, “The idea of Navarasa was a spark when we discussed it and the industry has come together to make it glow, give it soul and make it count for its people. We are happy that Netflix has come forward to take this confluence of emotion, talent, people and the cause to the world.”

Srishti Arya, Director, International Original Film, Netflix India said, “We’re thrilled to be the home to these nine extraordinary films. We admire how this wonderful ensemble of filmmakers and talent have joined hands to support the creative community. Navarasa is a celebration of the craft of filmmaking and the magic of Tamil cinema that we can’t wait to take to the world.”

The project is being produced under the banner of Justickets, in association with AP International and Wide Angle Creations as executive producers. All the talent and companies involved in the project have offered their services pro bono, with the sole objective of supporting the industry at large.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mtp9a0/article32961173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mani-RatnamNAVARASANETFLIX,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/navarasa-mani-ratnam-suriya-headline-host-of-talent-part-of-new-netflix-anthology/article32961176.ece
177,2020/10/28,Grace Antony steals the show as Suhara in ‘Halal Love Story’,"Grace’s portrayal of the reluctant actor in the new Malayalam film showcases her acting chops

As the graceful Suhara with a mind of her own, Grace Antony is undoubtedly the scene-stealer of Halal Love Story. Even when paired with an actor like Indrajith Sukumaran who effortlessly steps into the skin of his characters, Grace held her own comfortably.

“I was more than a little nervous when I was offered the role. I was going to be in the company of actors like Indrajith, Parvathy [Thiruvothu], Joju [George] and so on. It was a challenge to bring Suhara alive on screen as she was a completely new character, one that I was not familiar with,” says Grace.

She was worried about the dialect and wondered if she would be able to pull it off without sounding clichéd and put on. As the director and many members of the crew were from Malappuram, they helped her in getting the accent and intonation of the dialogues right.

“The shooting was in Vazhakkad in Malappuram. During breaks, I used to spend time in a chechi’s house that was next to our location. I observed the way she would adjust her thattam (head dress used by Muslim women to cover their head), the way she spoke and interacted with her family and visitors…. That made a difference,” points out Grace.

She adds that as an avid people-watcher, she was able to quickly get the nuances of her character by observing the residents around the location.

Since the story involves the shooting of a film, Grace also wondered if the mise en scenes would fall in place without looking artificial and put on. But Grace’s Suhara proved equal to the challenge. With some pithy lines to deliver, Suhara is easily one of the strongest characters in the film. “There are two Suharas in the film and I had to ensure that one did not become the other. Until viewers started appreciating the film, I was apprehensive whether I had been able to get my act together,” says Grace.

Model and actor Grace came into her own as Simi, an unforgettable character in Kumbalangi Nights. Working with powerful actors like Fahadh Faasil and Soubin Shahir did not overawe her. Following the resounding success of Kumbalangi Nights, Grace was just about finding her niche in Malayalam cinema when the pandemic brought things to a standstill in tinsel town.

“The entire world has been affected. So it would sound selfish if I were to say how disappointed I was when all shooting was stopped and theatres closed just when my career was beginning to take off,” says Grace, speaking on phone from Kochi.

The lockdown also had Grace directing a short film, K-nowledge, about a young girl dealing with the onset of menstruation. Nevertheless, Grace says that while she will be writing scripts as and when time permits, she wants to focus on her time in front of the camera. “There is Simply Soumya in which I play the lead with Sreenath Bhasi. There are a couple of other projects that I am a part of. I am also eagerly awaiting the release of Saajan Bakery Since 1962 where I will be playing the wife of the character enacted by Aju Varghese,” she says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/awse7a/article32960848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27tvmgrace,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/grace-antonys-suhara-is-the-scene-stealer-in-halal-love-story/article32960849.ece
178,2020/10/28,Northeast monsoon arrives over Tamil Nadu,"The State receives an average of 44 cm of rainfall during the NE monsoon between October and December.

Northeast monsoon arrived over the south peninsular region, including Tamil Nadu and Kerala, on Wednesday. While the monsoon made a weak onset over the State, it is expected to pick up pace in a few days, according to the Meteorological Department.

Northeasterly winds and a cyclonic circulation over southwest Bay of Bengal off north Tamil Nadu coast aided the commencement of NE monsoon. After an extended stay, Southwest monsoon retreated from the country on Wednesday and paved the way for the onset of NE monsoon.

Tamil Nadu receives an average of 44 cm of rainfall during the NE monsoon between October and December.

S.Balachandran, deputy director of meteorology, Chennai said NE monsoon commenced with sporadic rainfall over south Tamil Nadu and coastal areas and did not cover the entire region. Melur in Madurai district received 6 cm of rainfall, the highest amount received during the past 24 hours ending at 8.30 a.m. on Wednesday. In Chennai district, Nungambakkkam and Sholinganalllur received 1 cm of rainfall.

“There was no significant weather system to bring heavy rainfall. Cyclone over Pacific Ocean too was drawing moisture away. The influence of the global weather pattern, La Nina, could also be a reason for the weak start of the monsoon,” he said. Though the average onset date is around October 20, a deviation of seven or eight days is still considered normal.

For the next two or three days, the Meteorological Department has forecast light to moderate rainfall over few places of south TN and one or two places of northern parts of the State and Puducherry. There may be heavy rains over one or two areas in Tirunelveli, Tenkasi and Virudhunagar districts.

In Chennai too, light to moderate rains or thundershowers are likely to occur in some areas till Friday. It may experience a day temperature of 30 degree Celsius for two days.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/a62hw3/article32962979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vedu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/northeast-monsoon-arrives-over-tamil-nadu/article32962980.ece
179,2020/10/28,"TN MPs flay appointment of controversial ABVP leader as member of AIIMS, Madurai","Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan, Virudhunagar MP B. Manickam Tagore and Villupuram MP Ravikumar condemned the appointment of Dr. Subbiah

Members of Parliament belonging to different political parties in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday criticised the appointment of controversial oncologist and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) president Shanmugam Subbiah as a member of the proposed All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Madurai.

Dr Subbiah, Professor and Head, Department of Surgical Oncology, Government Kilpauk Medical College, Chennai, was in the news a few months ago when he was accused of urinating outside the apartment of an elderly woman following a row over parking of his car. The complainant had circulated CCTV footage of the incident. However Dr Subbiah had denied the charges. The complaint was eventually withdrawn following a compromise.

In a notification, dated October 15, Sunil Sharma, joint secretary, Pradhan Mantri Swasthya Suraksha Yojana in Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has mentioned him as one of the members of AIIMS, Madurai.

Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan (CPI-M), Virudhunagar MP B. Manickam Tagore (Congress) and Villupuram MP Ravikumar (VCK leader), were among those who flayed the appointment.

Recalling the woman's complaint, Mr Tagore charged that Dr.Subbiah, has been given the post only because of his association with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. He wondered whether it was the rule of Manusmrithi. “Union Health Minister, Harshvardan, should immediately cancel Dr. Shamugam Subbiah’s appointment as he has insulted the women,” Mr. Tagore said.

Making the same charges, Mr. Venkatesan, questioned whether the new post was given to Dr. Subbiah for his “lowly act”. He said that he would continue to work without any break to realize the 25-year dream of setting up AIIMS at Madurai, in his social media post. Mr Ravikumar questioned if his appointment was not an insult to women.

Among other members are Dr. Sudha Seshayyan, Vice, Chancellor, The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University, Director General of Health Services, Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the Director of the Institute, Additional Secretary and Financial Advisor, Ministry of Health ad Family Welfare, Scretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Tamil Nadu State Chief Secretary.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-mps-flay-appointment-of-controversial-abvp-leader-as-member-of-aiims-madurai/article32962544.ece

181,2020/10/28,"Male leopard found dead, suspected to have been shot with a projectile","This is the third major wildlife crime reported in the Nilgiris in the last few months

A 5-year-old male leopard was found dead with an improvised projectile lodged in one of its hind limbs near Pandalur on Tuesday.

The leopard was found dead inside a tea field belonging to a major tea estate in Pandalur, and a post mortem was conducted. Apart from a few bite marks sustained possibly as a result of a fight with another animal, the postmortem revealed that the animal had been shot with a projectile which had lodged itself in one of its hind limbs, which forest officials believe had led to its death.

The animal was found dead just a few kilometers away from the area where a male elephant was found dead with a similar projectile lodged in one of its legs last month. On Wednesday, District Forest Officer, Gudalur Division, Sumesh Soman, admitted that there were “similarities” between the two incidents, but added that it was too early to come to a conclusion as to whether the killings of both the animals were connected.

“Three forest teams, a tracking team and a sniffer dog have been pressed into service to find the persons responsible,” said Mr. Soman, who added that the leopard had been shot just a few days prior to being found dead inside the estate.

This is the third major wildlife crime reported in the Nilgiris in the last few months. In September of this year, five wild dogs were killed in a suspected mass poisoning incident in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve.

183,2020/10/28,Child-friendly zones set up in six police stations in Cuddalore,"A number of women who approached the AWPS for lodging complaints including domestic abuse were invariably accompanied by their children.

The Cuddalore district police have created child-friendly spaces in all the six All Women Police Stations (AWPS) - Cuddalore, Panruti, Chidambaram, Sethiyathope, Neyveli and Virudhachalam with the aim to ensure an unintimidating and friendly environment to children.

A number of women who approached the AWPS for lodging complaints including domestic abuse were invariably accompanied by their children. The mothers bring their children as they cannot leave them alone at home.

“We wanted to have a safe and playful environment for the children and created child-friendly spaces. An enquiry will obviously take time. While the parents are meeting the police officers over their cases, the children will be taken to the spaces within the premises and kept there till the process is over,” says Superintendent of Police M. Sree Abhinav.

Cartoon characters have been painted on the walls while the spaces are also equipped with colouring books and toys to keep the children engaged. The facility is similar to a crèche and has mats for kids to sleep and toilets, Mr. Abhinav added.

According to Sethiyathope AWPS Inspector Agnesh Mary, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 mandates provisioning of child-friendly atmosphere. It also mandates guidelines to safeguard the victim at every stage of the judicial process by having child-friendly mechanisms for reporting and investigation.

“When victims of POCSO cases are brought to the AWPS, they initially refuse to talk as the incident has a tremendous effect on the mental health of the child. Now, we have tried to make the children comfortable by setting up child-friendly centres. The facility will also help provide an atmosphere of security to them”, she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gc7rj/article32961112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CUDD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/child-friendly-zones-set-up-in-six-police-stations-in-cuddalore/article32961113.ece
184,2020/10/28,"In a first, Debt Recovery Tribunal in Chennai admits insolvency plea against personal guarantor","Experts are of the view that the personal insolvency process under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 is likely to have strict timelines to be followed, unlike earlier regimes.

In a first of its kind in Tamil Nadu, Debt Recovery Tribunal – II, Chennai has admitted an insolvency petition against a personal guarantor Rohit Nath in a case filed by KEB Hana Bank.

Mr. Nath had given personal guarantee on loans availed by Alectrona Energy Private Limited.

The law on initiating insolvency proceedings against personal guarantors was notified on December 1, 2019 and according to experts the current development should come as a wakeup call for promoters and personal guarantors.

“Conventionally, in India, promoters and their family members, relatives, associates act as “Personal Guarantors” for debts borrowed by the Company from lenders/financial institutions. This is even more common in small and mid-sized Companies which were already in the red and now burdened with the pandemic effect,” Anant Merathia, a Chennai-based corporate lawyer said.

“With changing times and legal frameworks, this is a serious aspect that Indian promoters/guarantors must factor in both for the ongoing personal guarantees issued vis-à-vis defaults and performance of their companies and ones they propose to give for further funding. They should think twice before involving family members as personal guarantors,” Mr Merathia pointed out.

Experts are of the view that the personal insolvency process under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 is likely to have strict timelines to be followed, unlike earlier regimes.

Another interesting aspect to wait and watch is the outcome of the litigation challenging the constitutional validity of Provisions of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 with respect to personal guarantors.

185,2020/10/28,Doctors stress need for timely treatment of stroke,"They say a patient must be able to access a stroke centre

Ahead of World Stroke Day to be observed on October 29, senior neurologists have called for low-cost rehabilitation efforts. A person who suffers a stroke must be able to access a stroke centre for treatment. Strokes could lead to the death of neurons in the brain, resulting in paralysis. However, if treatment is provided as quickly as possible, the patient can be rehabilitated, doctors say.

Senior neurophysicians from across the country participated in a discussion on stroke on Tuesday. There are less than 100 stroke centres in the country and even these centres have a physiotherapist and a speech therapist, whereas one in four persons could experience stroke in their lifetime, the experts said. With most hospitals designated for COVID-19 treatment, such a health emergency as stroke should not be neglected, they said. A patient who has suffered stroke can be rehabilitated if he is immediately brought to a stroke centre. However, in India, people often go to traditional medical practitioners, causing a delay in treatment. Compliance with medication and appropriate treatment and advice could help patients recover, doctors say.

Jeyaraj Pandian, head, Department of Neurology, Christian Medical College, Ludhiana; senior neurologist S. Kumaravelu; P.N. Sylaja, Department of Neurology, Comprehensive Stroke Care Programme, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology; Vikram Huded, Head of Neurology, NH Institute of Neurosciences, Bengaluru; and Nirmal Surya, founder trustee and chairman, Epilepsy Foundation India, participated in the event.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/doctors-stress-need-for-timely-treatment-of-stroke/article32958868.ece
186,2020/10/28,Dull Deepavali for Madurai weavers,"They receive very few warps to weave saris; wages cut due to lack of demand

Deepavali is usually peak season for handloom weavers as more people go shopping for saris during this period. However, the festival season this year has been disappointing for the handloom weavers of Madurai district, mainly because of COVID-19.

The weavers say they have received very few ‘paavu’ (warps) to weave saris and have suffered a wage cut as sales have not picked up.

K.R. Kishore Babu, manager, Dhakshinamoorthy Weavers Cooperative Society, says many families of weavers are residing at Nilaiyur, Sakkimangalam, Thirunagar, Vandiyur, Krishnapuram Colony and Thiruvalluvar Colony. They receive orders from private agents and Co-optex for saris that are sold across the country.

K.M. Umadevi, a weaver from Nilaiyur, says the weavers used to receive four warps during Deepavali. “However, this year the private agents have given the weavers only one warp to weave saris.”

Mr. Babu says Co-optex has reduced the number of cotton saris procured from weavers. “Due to the financial distress caused by the pandemic, sari sales have been very poor and stocks have been piling up,” he adds.

Citing the poor sari sales, the private agents have reduced the wages for weaving a warp by 10%-15%, says N.T. Mani Baba, a weaver from Nilaiyur. “Usually, many members of a family work together, weaving a sari. With the wages cut, it has become extremely difficult to run our families,” he says.

J.D. Banumathi, a weaver from Vandiyur, says the wages are paid in instalments. “The private agents have not assured us of festival bonus this year. This will worsen our financial crisis as we earned a pittance during the lockdown period,” she says. “As we earn less, it is becoming difficult to pay the house rent and meet family expenses.”

This crisis will force many weavers to shift to other jobs, says A.S. Jayaprakash, a weaver from Vandiyur. He urges the government to fix minimum wages for weavers to avoid exploitation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/1r9mfj/article32958863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28HANDLOOMWEAVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dull-deepavali-for-madurai-weavers/article32958864.ece
187,2020/10/28,Octogenarian undergoes implant surgery 10 days after heart attack,"Doctors decided to operate to relieve her of pain from major fracture

An 87-year-old woman was recently operated upon for a fall at home, unusually, just as she was recovering from a heart attack.

Kamalabai, a resident of Thoraipakkam, was recovering from acute myocardial infarction for which she was treated at a private hospital earlier. Soon after she returned home, she had a fall, which broke her femur. Her family sought treatment at a private hospital at Nanganallur.

“The patient was recovering from myocardial infarction. Usually we don’t do surgery for at least three weeks after an attack of myocardial infarction. But in her case, as she had sustained a major fracture she had severe pain, which could lead to another attack. We decided to operate to relieve her of her pain and avoid further complications,” said V. Sivakumar, orthopaedic surgeon, Sivam Hospital.

The hypertensive octogenarian is also obese, the doctor said. Her heart was functioning at 30% of its capacity. But postponing the surgery would cause further complications, he said. The patient was given epidural anaesthesia and an implant was provided surgically. She is undergoing physiotherapy at the hospital. Post-surgery, her ejection fraction had improved to 40% as the woman was able to move. She now walks with a walker.

“The unique factor is that the patient had not recovered from myocardial infarction. Only 10 days prior to the fracture she had suffered a heart attack. Because of this, her heart ejection fraction is low. Without aggravating her heart condition, proximal femoral nailing was done under epidural anaesthesia [which is safer for the heart condition], instead of the general anaesthesia,” Dr. Sivakumar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/octogenarian-undergoes-implant-surgery-10-days-after-heart-attack/article32958861.ece

190,2020/10/28,"Sattankulam custodial deaths | Police tortured Jayaraj and Benicks knowing it will result in death, says CBI charge sheet","Charge sheet says injuries were caused at station.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), in its charge sheet against the nine policemen accused in the Sattankulam custodial death case, said trader P. Jayaraj and his son J. Benicks were subjected to brutal torture by the policemen, knowing well that it was sufficient to cause their death.

The expert opinion received from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), New Delhi, established that bleeding injuries were caused to the duo on the premises of the Sattankulam police station. The DNA profile generated from the exhibits lifted from the walls of the station were found to be consistent with the DNA profile generated from the blood-stained clothes of the deceased.

Sattankulam custodial deaths | When protectors turn perpetrators

All the material exhibits seized by the Kovilpatti Judicial Magistrate during the judicial inquiry and the exhibits obtained during the investigation were sent to the CFSL.

The exhibits included blood stains collected from the walls, lock-up, toilet, the room of the Station House Officer and other areas of the police station.

The services of a multi-disciplinary team of CFSL experts were requisitioned for inspection/reconstruction of the scene of crime. The team from New Delhi inspected the scene of crime at Sattankulam and materials were collected. The report of the team was awaited, and it would be produced before the court when received, the CBI said.

Editorial | Senseless deaths

Further, the CBI said there were inconsistencies in different reports/documents relating to the initial medical examination reports of the two deceased at the government hospital at Sattankulam. The reports, including inquest and post-mortem reports, have been referred to a multi-institutional medical board of forensic medicine experts, and the board’s report was awaited.

The investigation revealed that in pursuance of a criminal conspiracy hatched by the accused policemen, Jayaraj was picked up from his shop near the Kamaraj statue on June 19 at 7.30 p.m. and lodged at the police station. On information, Benicks rushed to the station to enquire about the arrest of his father. He objected to his father being beaten up. Following an altercation, the two were wrongfully confined at the police station and beaten up in order to teach them a lesson on how to behave with the police. The torture continued for several hours throughout the night, the CBI said.

Jayaraj and Benicks, with only their vests on, were made to bow down on a wooden table and subjected to a severe beating with batons. The police caught their hands so that they could not defend themselves. Jayaraj told the police about his blood pressure and diabetic condition, but they did not pay heed to his pleas, the CBI said.

The two were made to clean the blood that had oozed from their wounds and pooled on the floor with their own vest. The next morning the sweeper of the police station was made to clean the blood on the floor so as to destroy the evidence. A false case was registered against the two by the policemen, the CBI said.

During the investigation it was revealed that the traders had not violated the COVID-19 lockdown rules, the CBI said. A ‘fit for remand’ certificate was obtained despite severe injuries. The blood-stained clothes were dumped in the dustbin of the Sattankulam government hospital.

The father and the son were limping and unable to sit properly when they were produced before the Medical Officer. They were subsequently produced before the Sattankulam Judicial Magistrate for remand. It was at the Kovilpatti Sub-Jail that the two developed health complications and succumbed to injuries at the Kovilpatti government hospital.

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has disposed of a public interest litigation petition that had sought a direction to the State to remove the condition to fill the caste, religion and Aadhaar columns from the Educational Management Information System online registration after it was submitted that the disclosure in these columns was not mandatory.

Otherwise, the disclosure was not mandatory, she submitted.

192,2020/10/28,"VCK hits back, announces protest against Centre, BJP","It will also seek withdrawal of case against Thirumavalavan

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) founder Thol. Thirumavalavan on Tuesday announced that his party will launch protests against the Central government and the State BJP from October 28 onwards. The party will also seek the withdrawal of the case registered against Mr. Thirumavalavan for his remarks on women, based on his interpretation of the Manusmriti.

Protest today

In a statement, he said that the party would stage protests on October 28, urging the Centre to implement 50% reservation for OBCs in the All India Quota medical seats this year. The party would also stage protests against the State unit of the BJP “for spreading lies against the VCK” on October 31. The party would also distribute pamphlets explaining the basic tenets of the Manusmriti, the Hindu religious text, in villages from November 3 to November 5.

“The Centre implemented 10% reservation for the ‘economically weaker sections’ among the open competition category in just nine days. But why has it taken six years to implement reservation for OBCs in medical courses despite it being guaranteed in the Indian Constitution?” he asked. The Centre did not even intend to implement the 27% reservation for OBCs, he added.

Mr. Thirumavalavan accused the BJP and various Hindu groups of “spreading lies” about him to destabilise the DMK alliance, of which the VCK is a part of.

“The BJP and Sangh Parivar groups are trying to systematically work to gain a political foothold in Tamil Nadu. As a part of this effort, they have taken a 40-second edited video clip from my speech in an online event organised by the European Union Periyar Ambedkar Comrades Federation and are spreading lies against me. More than just attack me personally, they want to smear and create a crisis in the DMK alliance,” he said.

“They want to weaken the alliance by removing the VCK from the alliance,” he added.

He urged his cadres not to react to provocations by the BJP and said that they would expose themselves in front of the people with their own words.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8t0trp/article32958794.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28THOLTHIRUMAVALAVANVCK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vck-hits-back-announces-protest-against-centre-bjp/article32958795.ece
193,2020/10/28,DMK MPs request Amit Shah to direct Tamil Nadu Governor to clear reservation Bill,"Delay in giving assent will be detrimental to the future of students, they say

DMK MPs on Tuesday sought a direction from Union Home Minister Amit Shah to Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit to grant assent without delay to the Bill providing 7.5% reservation for the NEET-qualified government school students in the undergraduate medical courses.

In separate letters to Mr. Shah, the MPs pointed out that the Governor had been holding the Bill which was passed in the Tamil Nadu Assembly 43 days ago.

“The DMK has been demanding the scrapping of NEET, which acts as a hindrance to the rural and urban poor students to pursue medical studies and to realise their dream of becoming future doctors,” the MPs said. They said party president M.K. Stalin had already written a letter to the Governor, urging him to give assent to the Bill immediately so that the government school students could avail themselves of the benefit of reservation in this academic year itself.

“But, surprisingly the Governor had replied that he would need another 3 to 4 weeks to decide on the Bill – after holding back this very important Bill for about 40 days,” they pointed out.

The MPs said that since the counselling dates for medical admission (by Medical Counselling Committee) had been announced any further delay in giving consent to the Bill would be detrimental to the future of government school students.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmk-mps-request-amit-shah-to-direct-tamil-nadu-governor-to-clear-reservation-bill/article32958791.ece

Palaniswami would apologise to the people of Tamil Nadu for “having suppressed the murders of trader Jayaraj and his son, J. Benicks, in the Sathankulam police station and denigrating the Police Department” in his attempt to safeguard a few corrupt uniformed personnel.

Recalling the chargesheet of the CBI that said that Jeyaraj and his son, Benicks, died of police torture inside the station, Mr. Stalin said the Chief Minister first claimed that they died after having breathing troubles.

Later, he sought to cover up the incident through a statement from Law Minister C.V. Shanmugam, he added. “Since the DMK did not have faith in the Chief Minister, it demanded a CBI inquiry. The reputation of the police has hit rock-bottom under the corrupt government of Mr. Palaniswami,” he said.

Another case

Mr. Stalin alleged that in another case, Dr. Sivaramaperumal, the DMK’s medical wing deputy organiser in Kanniyakumari district, died by suicide after the local DSP used filthy language in front of his wife during an inquiry. “The action of a few police officers has earned a bad name for the entire Police Department,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cm-should-apologise-for-sattankulam-deaths-stalin/article32958790.ece
195,2020/10/28,Six detained for vandalising a church cemetery in Udaiyaarpatti,"They were booked under the National Security Act

Six of the eight accused who have been arrested in connection with vandalising 86 tombs in a cemetery under the Sacred Heart Church at Udaiyaarpatti here on October 16, have been detained under the National Security Act (NSA).

S. Udaiyaar, 53, Tirunelveli district president of the Hindu Makkal Katchi from Vannarpet here; K. Muruganantham, 48, of Veeravanallur; T. Sankar, 52, of Veeravanallur; R. Sabarirajan, alias, Ayyappan, 50, of Murappanaadu in Thoothukudi district; Senthamarai, 42, of Palayamkottai; and A. Kanthan, 38, of Tirunelveli, have been detained under the Act.

The Bishop of Palayamkottai RC Diocese, S. Antonysamy, accompanied by the office-bearers of various political parties, including the ruling AIADMK, had submitted a petition to Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish on October 18, seeking stringent action against the culprits involved in the desecration of the tombs with the objective of triggering clashes between different religious groups.

Subsequently, the six persons were detained. The group of men, armed with crowbars, hammers and other weapons, entered the cemetery at Manimurtheeswaram on the night of October 16, and smashed the granite crosses on 86 tombs and crushed the polished granite slabs on the tombs.

The matter triggered tension in the Udaiyaarpatti area when it came to light on Sunday morning. Parishioners of the Sacred Heart Church blocked vehicular traffic on the North Bypass Road near the church.

Based on a complaint by Joseph Michael Selvaraj, the parish priest of the Church, the Thatchanallur police commenced an investigation. The investigation reportedly revealed that it was the handiwork of Udaiyaar and seven others.

The police registered case against them under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 297 (trespassing on burial places), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 294 B (sings, recites or utters any obscene songs or words in public places), 353 A (assaults or uses criminal force to deter public servant) and 506 (2) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code against Udaiyaar, K.

197,2020/10/28,Assembly Secretary moves Madras High Court to vacate stay in privilege case,"It relates to Stalin and 17 MLAs displaying gutkha sachets in Assembly in 2017

Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Secretary K. Srinivasan has moved the Madras High Court to vacate the stay imposed on September 24 on breach of privilege proceedings initiated against DMK president M.K. Stalin and 17 MLAs for displaying gutkha sachets in the House on July 19, 2017.

The applications are expected to be listed before Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana on Wednesday. They have been filed before the single judge in accordance with liberty granted to the Assembly Secretary as well as the Committee of Privileges by Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy on October 13.

In an affidavit filed in support of the applications to vacate the stay, Mr. Srinivasan pointed out that Speaker P. Dhanapal had, suo motu, referred the issue of display of gutkha sachets in the Assembly to the Committee of Privileges. Accordingly, show cause notices were issued to them on August 28, 2017. The MLAs moved individual writ petitions before the High Court immediately thereafter and obtained interim orders against the proceedings. After a gap of three years, their writ petitions were taken up for final hearing by the first Division Bench led by the Chief Justice in August this year and the judgment was delivered soon thereafter.

Foundational error

The Bench, on August 25, held that the show cause notices suffered from a foundational error of assuming that the MLAs’ conduct of displaying gutkha sachets in the Assembly was prohibited under the law. It was pointed out that only manufacture, sale and transportation of gutkha had been banned in the State and the MLAs had attempted to prove that the ban was not being implemented effectively.

The Division Bench, however, left it open to the Privileges Committee to take a re-look into the issue and decide whether any breach of the privileges of the House had been committed otherwise by the MLAs.

Subsequently, the Committee deliberated on the matter and issued fresh show cause notices to the MLAs on September 7. The new notices accused the MLAs of not only displaying gutkha sachets without prior permission of the Speaker but also of having caused disturbance to the Assembly proceedings and setting a bad precedent.

Mr. Stalin and other MLAs of his party challenged the new show cause notices too and obtained an order of interim stay from Justice Sathyanarayana on September 24. When the stay order was taken on appeal by the Assembly Secretary and the Privileges Committee, the Bench led by the Chief Justice refused to suspend the operation of the single judge’s order.

It, nevertheless, granted liberty to the appellants to move a vacate stay application before the single judge and hence the present plea.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/a3yp8n/article32958752.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28MADRASHIGHCOURTVG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/assembly-secretary-moves-madras-high-court-to-vacate-stay-in-privilege-case/article32958753.ece

The Tiruvannamalai police have arrested seven persons, who smuggled 100 kg of ganja from Andhra Pradesh by concealing it in cement sacks on Monday night.

The police received information about ganja being smuggled into Tiruvannamalai from Andhra Pradesh. A special team was formed by Superintendent of Police S. Aravind comprising ASP T. Ashok Kumar, inspectors R. Sasi Kumar and D. VInayakamoorthy.

During vehicles were checked at Kannamangalam police station limits, the team intercepted a lorry and found 40 bags of ganja, weighing 100 kg, amidst the cement sacks.

200,2020/10/28,"Centre allocates Home posts between TS, AP","Nine non-cadre SPs, 49 additional SPs and 192 DSPs allotted to Telangana

The allocation of officials of the Home department in some categories pending between the two Telugu States has finally been completed.

The Central government released orders on Wednesday allocating officials of the cadre of non-cadre Superintendents of Police, Additional Superintendents of Police (Civil) and Deputy Superintendents of Police (Civil) between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Accordingly, nine non-cadre SPs, 49 additional SPs and 192 DSPs are allotted to Telangana while 16 non-cadre SPs, 64 additional SPs and 302 DSPs were allotted to Andhra Pradesh under Section 77 (2) of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014.

The Centre, according to officials, intervened in the issue as the two States could not resolve the differences that arose in the allocation of the officials notwithstanding several rounds of deliberations between senior officials representing the two sides. The order would, however, be not effective for employees who obtained stay against their allocation to any of the successor States. Orders in respect of such officials would become effective only on vacation of the stay.

The Union government said persons who were yet to be allocated between the two States would continue to work in their respective places till the allocation is made by the Central government based on the recommendations made by the advisory committee.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/centre-allocates-home-posts-between-ts-ap/article32966867.ece
201,2020/10/28,Chief Minister to launch ‘Dharani’ land records portal today,"Staff entrusted with task express concerns over speed, network connectivity

The stage is all set for launch of the ambitious Dharani portal, the one-of-its-kind integrated land record management system, on Thursday.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao will formally launch the portal at Muduchintala village in the neighbouring Medchal-Malkajgiri district on Thursday afternoon. The launch will also witness resumption of registration services that had been abruptly stopped since September 7 consequent to the passage of bills ushering in major reforms in the Revenue Administration.

Though the launch of the portal was programmed on October 25, coinciding with auspicious Vijaya Dasami, it had to be deferred by a few days as inclement weather conditions had impacted the progress of putting in place online network for the smooth functioning of Dharani. Problems on account of the network were visible during the trial run of the portal in the last few days when the Revenue officials faced technical glitches due to slow broadband services.

Concerns were expressed by the staff, who attended the training courses, over the speed and network connectivity related issues. While there were complaints that the tahsildars could not log on to the network despite repeated attempts from some places, those who managed to login complained that they could not upload any documents.

Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar has assured that he would take the responsibility of ensuring the required speed and bandwidth of the network so that there is no scope for complaints in that direction. On the technological front, the government has taken steps to ensure that data uploaded on the portal is protected.

Servers are, accordingly, being set up at multiple locations like New Delhi or Bhubaneswar as part of effective disaster management practices and they would also act as backup mechanism to ensure that data is stored in a fool-proof manner. There are disaster recovery sites that would be part of the Dharani application combining data of registration and mutation of immovable properties in the State.

The government has initiated steps to see that experienced players were made part of supply installation and commissioning of the high speed SAN (storage area network) with capacity of 200 TB connecting different data storage devices to seven servers that would be exclusively functioning for Dharani. The portal was conceived as a one-stop solution for all land related transactions across the State and decided to make all the transactions online. This on the one hand would reduce human intervention to the maximum extent and pave the way for hassle-free, simple and transparent process for the people on the other.

Intensive hands-on training has been given to the employees at different levels on the operation of the new system. Booklets on operational guidelines have been circulated at all levels and officials concerned were given hands-on training on conducting registrations, mutations and other processes through Dharani. Concerns are also being expressed over the sudden shift to the new system without rectifying the problems encountered in the data entered in the Re-Settlement Register and other issues.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/n25xoj/article32966832.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy29dharnicol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/chief-minister-to-launch-dharani-land-records-portal-today/article32966833.ece
202,2020/10/28,Bhadrachalam temple to tap solar energy,"The historic Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy complex aims to reduce its annual power bill of around ₹ 1 crore

Dwindling income and rising electricity costs have prompted the authorities of the historic Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy temple in Bhadrachalam to chart out a plan to tap solar energy to meet the electricity needs of the temple in a cost-effective and eco-friendly way.

With the COVID-19 crisis continuing to take its toll on the temple revenues with sharp drop in footfall of devotees, the cost-cutting measures have gained renewed focus in recent weeks. Prior to the crisis, the annual revenue of the temple from all sources including hundi offerings, donations and sale of prasadams ranged between ₹ 35 crore to ₹ 40 crore. The temple witnessed a drastic fall in income ever since the crisis triggered by the pandemic broke out.

In this backdrop, the temple authorities have mooted a proposal to set up a solar power plant at the temple to offshoot the whopping power bill costs. The move is aimed at reducing the huge expenditure of around ₹ 1 crore being incurred by the temple towards electricity bills for consumption of power by the whole temple complex, around 18 cottages, and 140 rooms in choultries, annually, sources said.

The temple authorities have already initiated the process of entering into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a Hyderabad-based solar energy systems company for setting up a rooftop solar power plant as per the guidelines of the Telangana State Renewable Energy Development Corporation (TSREDCO) in the Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) mode. In this zero-investment model, the agency concerned will take up the responsibility of installation, maintenance and repairs of the plant for 25 years and the temple has to pay for the solar power consumed, sources added.

When contacted, the Divisional Engineer of the temple Ravindranath told The Hindu that an agreement to set up a solar power plant at the temple in the RESCO mode is in the advanced stage of finalisation. The proposed plant is expected to generate 400 MW energy from the solar panels to be mounted on the rooftops at the temple complex, he said. The move is expected to offer multiple advantages such as significantly reducing the expenditure on power bills by harnessing the green energy and environmental benefits, he remarked. It will help cut down electricity bills by at least 30% (₹ 30 lakh) per annum.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/4rvae4/article32966749.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29BCHALAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bhadrachalam-temple-to-tap-solar-energy/article32966751.ece
203,2020/10/28,TN IPS official observer for Dubbak poll,"In a rare move, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has appointed Saroj Kumar Thakur, an IPS officer of Tamil Nadu cadre, as police observer for Dubbak by-election. “In exercise of powers conferred on it by Article 324 of the Constitution of India and Section 208 of the Representation of People Act, 1961, the Election Commission hereby appoint Saroj Kumar Thakur, IPS, TN, 2010, as police observer for the by-elections to the 41- Dubbak Assembly constituency, Siddipet district,” read a press release issued by the ECI on Wednesday.

On October 26, a high drama took place at Siddipet where police seized ₹18.67 lakh from the house of Surabhi Anjan Rao, a relative of BJP candidate M. Raghunandan Rao. However, BJP workers who reached there in large numbers along with the candidate alleged that the police had tried to put the cash in the house of S. Ramgopal Rao, father-in-law of Raghunandan Rao. From there the BJP workers allegedly snatched ₹12.8 lakh from the police and a case was registered against 27 persons in the matter and three of them were arrested and sent in remand. An amount of ₹27,500 was recovered from them.

Initially, police said that raids were held at eight places and money was seized from two places. Later, the number of raids conducted was put at four.

BJP Sate president Bandi Sanjay, who was not allowed to enter Siddipet on the night of October 26, stated his party would lodge a complaint against Joyal Davis, Commissioner of Police, Siddipet, alleging that police were favoring the ruling party.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tn-ips-official-observer-for-dubbak-poll/article32966559.ece
204,2020/10/28,"Every family benefited from our schemes, says Finance Minister","Contest is between Congress and BJP for deposits and second place, says Harish

One of the key figures in the Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the government, Finance Minister T. Harish Rao is no stranger to elections, be it his own polls or for the party. The same is the case now as he spearheads the campaign in Dubbak Assembly constituency, which is going to bypolls next week ,following the death of sitting member Solipeta Ramalinga Reddy. In his inimitable style, Mr. Rao has been attracting voters, addressing large gatherings, meeting voters and earning the goodwill of people. Taking time off his busy campaign schedule, the Finance Minister spoke to The Hindu at length on the prospects of the party in the by-elections and explains how the opposition Congress and the BJP are way behind the ruling party and exuded the confidence that the party would retain the Dubbak seat. Question: On what basis you are seeking votes in the byelections?

Answer: During the past six years we have taken up various development activities and at least one from every family benefited from our schemes - be it Aasara pensions, Kalyana Lakshmi, KCR kit, Rythu Bandhu or Rythu Bima. Dubbak, with 1.98 lakh voters, is an agriculture-dominated constituency with 78,000 farmers benefiting with ₹5,000 per acre each season. There are about 20,000 beedi farmers and 60,000 Aasara pensioners. Our schemes are self-explanatory of our performance.

Is the ‘sympathy wave’ working in the party’s favour?

We have won three byelections – Narayankhed (Sangareddy dt.), Palair (Khammam dt.) and Huzurnagar (Nalgonda dt). We won Narayankhed and Palair, where the deceased Congress MLAs’ families contested. We won at the height of sympathy wave and in Dubbak the sympathy is for our candidate. It will be a smooth sail and our candidate has already covered 130 villages out of the 148 in addition to the wards in the constituency headquarters.

How is the competition from Congress and BJP?

We are exposing the misdeeds of both parties. For instance we have been offering ₹2,016 pension for beedi workers whereas Congress introduced skull symbol on the beedi packet while BJP gifted them GST. The BJP has promised one crore jobs per annum and what happened to six crore jobs in the past six years? The competition is between Congress and BJP to get deposits and for second place, not for first place. They can continue their politics and retain party workers in the State only if they secure the second position. We are telling people that the demonetisation introduced by BJP had shattered the economy.

Are the voters convinced of the government programmes, performance and deliverables?

The public response is overwhelming. We are telling people what we are offering and exposing both national parties. For instance, when BJP leaders are claiming that Centre’s share is ₹1,600 in beedi workers pension. Likewise, in the case of KCR kit. They do not know even the complete details of the scheme and each leader is telling something different. So far they have not responded. BJP is resorting to false campaign and banking heavily on social media. I have challenged them to an open debate but they have not responded.

In the case of power, BJP wants to establish meters for borewell motors while during Congress regime it was motors which burnt due to erratic power supply. We are offering round-the-clock power with quality. We are asking farmers to chose their choice among the three.

What will be the impact of late Cheruku Muthyam Reddy on the elections? Will it be advantage Congress?

Actually it was advantage TRS! This constituency has severe drought and power problem. We have brought Kaleshwaram water here from 300 km and addressed the water problem. Similarly, we have addressed the power problem by establishing a number of transformers and substations. Muthyam Reddy had failed to address these problems while in power. Congress candidate Srinivas Reddy, while in TRS, said that his father’s soul would weep if he contested elections on Congress ticket. Now how is he contesting?

What your reaction on the recent episode at Siddipet where money was seized from BJP candidate’s relative’s house?

BJP leaders are acting out of frustration. The videos released by the police have exposed how the BJP leaders behave like goondas and snatched money from police. If the money did not belong to him, why did BJP candidate Raghunandan Rao rush to Siddipet, abandoning the campaign?",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trhfw4/article32966287.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29HYCAMPAIG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/every-family-gained-from-our-schemes/article32966288.ece
205,2020/10/28,New house a dream come true for homeless couple,"Winners Foundation builds house for an elderly couple

For elderly couple Pyaram Chandraiah and Lakshmi of Chandapur village in Chinnashankarampet mandal, it was a dream come true. They got a new house and even the house warming ceremony was performed on Wednesday, thanks to Winners Foundation, BDL Bhanur employees’ social arm, which got a house constructed for them within 50 days.

On the night of August 16, their old house collapsed due to heavy rains and they were left on the road with whatever they had, literally. Every material in the house got damaged. They had even lost their small jobs well before the incident due to coronavirus. Since then, they started living under a tree.

After knowing about their plight through the media, Arikapudi Raghu, president of Winners Foundation, decided to set up a house for the old couple.

“We started constructing the house on September 11 with the help of Burugupally Chandra Shekhar, Sridevi and some other persons and completed it with about ₹4 lakh. Some NRIs also stepped in to help them.

206,2020/10/28,Panel to assess structures of Hussainsagar,"Govt. sets up 10-member committee

The State government has constituted a 10-member committee of officials and experts to take up comprehensive assessment of the structures of Hussainsagar in Hyderabad.

According to the orders issued on Wednesday, the committee will be headed by Engineer-in-Chief (Irrigation) C. Muralidhar and ENC of Roads and Buildings I.

Satyanarayana and Joint Secretary in the Irrigation Department S. Bheem Prasad will be the member-convenor.

The government has decided to get the assessment done due to the recent unprecedented rains and floods in and around GHMC area. A majority of the 185 lakes located in the city limits have exceeded full tank level (FTL), straining their bunds and regulatory infrastructure.

Following the directions of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, 15 teams have been formed by the Irrigation department for monitoring the flood situation in respect of these lakes. The committee constituted now would take stock of the current scenario and challenges in the future, particularly in terms of the tanks’ structural stability, hydrological aspects, flood routing and improvements needed to structures.

207,2020/10/28,BJP pushed economy from slowdown to lockdown; KTR,"Mr. KTR’s strong reaction on BJP came in the backdrop of the money seizure controversy.

The TRS working president and IT Minister, K.T. Rama Rao attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the centre stating it has successfully brought down the Indian economy from slowdown to lockdown mode.

In an informal interaction with reporters here, he said the projected 0% growth rate was entirely due to the BJP’s failure to manage the economy. “For the last eight quarters Indian economy saw the slowdown and this was much before Coronavirus came into the picture. You have hit the growing economy of India with your inability and also let down the people of India,” Mr. KTR said.

Taking a dig at the Finance Minister, Nirmala Seetharaman’s statement on Corona as an “Act of God”, he said BJP makes promises, mismanages and then shifts the blame onto others through their ‘WhatsApp’ university. Mr. KTR asked where are the 2 crore jobs promised by the Prime Minister and the ₹15 lakhs to be deposited in each account and the assurance of Houses to all by 2020.

Referring to the claims of BJP state unit that Centre’s contribution to all schemes of the State was huge, he said the party would give even Goebbels a run for his money through fake narratives and propaganda. “They are seen more in social media than in the society,” he said challenging the BJP to release a white paper on Central government’s contribution to Telangana.

Mr. KTR’s strong reaction on BJP came in the backdrop of the money seizure controversy in Dubbaka constituency where police confiscated more than ₹18 lakhs from the BJP candidate Raghunandan Rao’s relative and the subsequent allegations and counter-allegations by both the parties. “BJP believes in creating confusion when it cannot convince.” The BJP leaders had alleged that police was caught while placing the cash in the BJP supporter’s residence to blame them.

Will attack PM

The Minister took strong objection to the abusive language used by the BJP cadre on the Chief Minister, K. Chandrashekar Rao and said TRS was losing patience and it would be forced to use similar language against Prime Minister, Narendra Modi or the Union Ministers. “We can use abusive language as well,” he said reminding how the Chief Minister prevented people ridiculing the Prime Minister during the lockdown. “We respect institutions.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bl1jlp/article32962915.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KTRAMARAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bjp-pushed-economy-from-slowdown-to-lockdown-ktr/article32962916.ece
208,2020/10/28,Death sentence for Warangal mass murderer,"Police say he killed nine migrants in May to cover up another murder

A local court in Warangal on Wednesday awarded death sentence to Sanjay Kumar Yadav of Bihar, after convicting him of killing nine persons, including a three-year-old boy, five months ago.

The 24-year-old convict, who was brought to the First Additional District and Sessions Judge court hall amidst tight security, appeared unfazed as Judge K. Jaya Kumar pronounced the verdict. The death sentence was conveyed to him in Hindi through a translator.

The victims, all of them members of migrant workers’ families, were killed on the intervening night of May 20 and 21 this year in Gorrekunta village of Geesukonda mandal in Warangal district.

Mamnoor Assistant Commissioner of Police G. Shyam Sunder, who investigated the case, filed the chargesheet within a month. Police accused Sanjay of killing the nine persons to cover up the murder of a woman Rafika, who he threw out of a running train near Tadepallygudem after giving her sleeping pills.

“A separate murder case was registered by the Government Railway Police of A.P. against Sanjay for this. The chargesheet is yet to be filed in this case,” Public Prosecutor (PP) Mokila Satyanarayana Goud said.

Sanjay is also facing another criminal case registered by the Warangal police under Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 5 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

This case was filed after investigators found evidence that he had sexually assaulted Rafika’s minor daughter and impregnated her. A chargesheet was filed and trial in the case is likely to begin soon.

Mr. Satyanarayana Goud said Rafika was a close relative of Nisha Alam, one of the nine victims. Nisha knew that Rafika, who had three children, was in a live-in relationship with Sanjay.

Sanjay decided to eliminate Rafika when she began to pressure him to marry her, Mr. Goud said.

After throwing her from a running train in March at Tadepallygudem, he returned to Warangal. Nisha Alam became suspicious as he evaded answers to queries about Rafika. When she threatened to approach the police, Sanjay decided to eliminate her and her family members, the PP said.

Sleeping pills in food

He mixed sleeping pills in the food prepared for the birthday party of Nisha Alam’s son.

After consuming it, Nisha Alam, five of her family members and three other migrant workers fell unconscious. Sanjay dumped them in a nearby well, killing all of them, the PP said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/telangana-assembly-elections-2018/m3b992/article32969083.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Massmurderer,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/death-sentence-for-man-convicted-for-killing-9-migrants-in-warangal/article32962897.ece
209,2020/10/28,Bangladesh team gets ready to welcome Shakib as his ban ends on October 29,"The 33-year-old all-rounder is currently in the United States with his family and is expected to return to Bangladesh early next month.

Bangladesh’s cricket establishment is waiting eagerly to welcome Shakib Al Hasan with open arms as he completes his one-year anti-corruption rule violation ban on October 29.

Shakib was handed a two-year ban, with a one-year suspended sentence, by ICC’s Anti-Corruption Unit on October 29 last year, for failing to report multiple corrupt approaches by an Indian bookmaker.

Shakin during numerous interactions later has confessed that it was a mistake on his part to have not notified the authorities. And Mahmudullah said Bangladesh cricket team is waiting with bated breath to welcome back Shakib into the dressing room.

“Our boy is coming back home,” said an elated Bangladesh T20 captain Mahmudullah, which is the collective mood of country’s cricketing fraternity. We know that Shakib has been the best player for so many years, for the Bangladesh cricket team. We are all eagerly waiting for his return to the dressing room,” Mahmudullah was quoted as saying by ESPN Cricinfo.

“It feels good to know that we can see him, talk to him and spend time with him,” he added.

The 33-year-old all-rounder is currently in the United States with his family and is expected to return to Bangladesh early next month.

“Shakib is a champion player. I think it won’t take him long to get back to rhythm. I believe that he will get it back as soon as he enters the cricket field,” said Mahmudullah, who has been playing international cricket along side Shakib for the last 13 years.

“The biggest thing is that we can fill up the gap that his absence had created. He always makes important contributions with the bat and ball.”

Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) chief selector Minhajul Abedin said Shakib will be eased into the international scene through the domestic route.

“Our best player is coming back to the field. He now has to prepare himself for domestic tournaments since we don’t have any international series for the time being,” Abedin said. “We have to monitor his physical condition. Let him start in domestic cricket. We should give him time but he is a very experienced player. He won’t take long to get back into rhythm,” he said.

Abedin admitted that Bangladesh badly missed Shakib during the last one year. “We definitely missed him. He is one of the best all-rounders in the world and there are so few of them these days. We are lucky to have a batting all-rounder like him, which gives us a lot of advantage.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/yhbnx3/article29829619.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THLTFILES-CRICKET-BAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/bangladesh-team-gets-ready-to-welcome-shakib-as-his-ban-ends-on-october-29/article32963287.ece
210,2020/10/28,"Very genesis of FIR against Sushant’s sisters is flawed, says CBI","Allegations levelled in it are mostly presumptive and speculative in nature, it says.

The CBI, in its reply to a plea filed by the sisters of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput to quash the FIR against them filed by actor Rhea Chakraborty has said, “The very genesis of the FIR is flawed.”

The Central agency filed its reply after a division bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and M.S. Karnik on Tuesday directed it to reply to the petition filed by Priyanka and Meetu Singh.

No info leaked to media on Sushant case, probe agencies tell HC

Referring to the FIR filed by Ms. Chakraborty on September 7, the CBI said: “The very genesis of the FIR registered at police station Bandra is flawed. The allegations levelled in FIR are mostly presumptive and speculative in nature.”

Anil Kumar Yadav, Addl. SP, said, “It is settled law that two FIRs cannot be registered on the same cause of action. It is a fact that the CBI is already investigating the causes relating to death of Sushant Singh Rajput on the basis of a complaint filed by K.K. Singh, father of the deceased. The CBI is meticulously investigating all the aspects related to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput. In view of the present situation and order passed by Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, it was expected from the Mumbai police to forward the complaint received from Ms. Rhea Chakraborty to the CBI for necessary action, instead of registering an FIR itself.”

The reply mentioned, “Registration of another FIR on the same facts and cause of action was neither warranted nor allowed under law. Thus the FIR is vitiated and bad in law.

It is submitted that it is correct that if the allegations mentioned in the FIR, prima facie, do not constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused, the FIR can be quashed by Constitutional Courts.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fgd901/article30635400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-CBI-headquarters,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/very-genesis-of-fir-against-sushants-sisters-is-flawed-says-cbi/article32964486.ece
211,2020/10/28,Samajwadi Party nominee for Madhya Pradesh bypoll joins BJP,"The SP had fielded Bansilal Jatav from Ambah Assembly seat in Morena for the by-election.

Ahead of the November 3 bypolls to 28 Assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh, a Samajwadi Party candidate from a seat in Morena district has joined the BJP.

The SP had fielded Bansilal Jatav from Ambah Assembly seat in Morena for the by-election.

“He joined the BJP on Tuesday night in the presence of Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar,” BJP district president Yogeshpal Gupta said on Wednesday.

He has extended support to BJP’s Ambah seat candidate Kamlesh Jatav and is now campaigning for the party, Mr Gupta said.

Bansilal Jatav was earlier elected three times from Ambah seat on BJP’s ticket, but joined the SP recently after the saffron party denied him ticket for the by-election.

The BJP candidate from Ambah, Kamlesh Jatav, is one of the 22 Congress MLAs who resigned from the party and their Assembly membership in March this year.

The resignation of the 22 Congress MLAs, most of them loyalists of Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia, led to the collapse of the Kamal Nath-led State government and cleared the way for the BJP to again come to power.

Mr Scindia and his loyalists later joined the BJP, with some of the rebel MLAs becoming ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led State government.

212,2020/10/28,Civil judge dismissed for torturing minor girl in Uttarakhand,"An order to dismiss Deepali Sharma from service was issued by Additional Chief Secretary.

A civil judge in Uttarakhand has been dismissed from service for allegedly torturing a minor girl who worked as a domestic help at her residence, official sources here said on Wednesday.

An order to dismiss Haridwar Civil Judge (Senior Division) Deepali Sharma from service for torturing a minor girl was issued by Additional Chief Secretary Radha Raturi following the Governor’s consent, the sources said.

Her dismissal is in keeping with a resolution to this effect passed by a full bench of the Uttarakhand High Court and the recommendation of the state government. The 13-year-old girl worked at Sharma’s residence in Haridwar as a domestic help from 2015 to 2018.

Ms. Sharma was under suspension in connection with the case since February 2018. Her suspension had followed a police raid at her Haridwar residence in January 2018 in compliance with an order of the Uttarakhand High Court. Police found during the raid that the girl had several injury marks on her body.

The girl was rescued and a charge sheet filed against Ms. Sharma which led to her suspension about a month later.

A 24-year-old man was shot dead in Aligarh old city area allegedly after a dispute over Indian Premier League (IPL) betting led to a clash between rival factions, police said on Wednesday.

Shakit (24), a Valmiki youth, was shot dead allegedly by two youths belonging to the Kori caste on Tuesday night. According to the report filed by the victim’s family, a minor argument over a motorcycle accident sparked the clash, police said.

The locals have however alleged that the area has become a hub of betting with the ongoing IPL season and there is a traditional rivalry between the two sub-castes in that area which led to the incident, police said. A probe is on to ascertain the claims, they added.

Shakit was rushed to the Malkhan Singh district hospital on Tuesday night but succumbed to his injuries shortly after being admitted. As news of the shooting spread, incidents of arson were reported from the area as rival groups belonging to the Kori caste clashed with those belonging to the Valmikis.

SSP Muniraj G told mediapersons that heavy police deployment has been put in place since late Tuesday night and the situation is under control.

He said one person has been arrested from the spot and the police are searching for another person who has been named in the killing. In reply to a question, the SSP said the motive behind the killing is being probed and “if it is found to be connected with betting then that charge will be investigated”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/youth-shot-dead-in-clash-over-ipl-betting-in-uttar-pradeshs-aligarh/article32963133.ece

215,2020/10/28,Coronavirus | COVID-19 fatality catches up with Mizoram,"It became the last State to report a death due to the novel coronavirus after a 62-year-old man succumbed to the disease

Mizoram on Wednesday became the last of the States in the country to report a COVID-19 fatality.

Health officials in Mizoram said a 62-year-old man died at the Zoram Medical College in State capital Aizawl after undergoing treatment for more than 10 days.

“The first COVID-19 related mortality in Mizoram comes as a huge shock to the entire State. We are pained and will continue putting up our guards against this pandemic,” said Chief Minister Zoramthanga, adding that the man had co-morbidities.

The State reported its first COVID-19 death 223 days after a 76-year-old man in Karnataka had become India’s first victim of the novel coronavirus on March 12.

According to an update by Mizoram’s Directorate of Information and Public Relations at 7 a.m. on Wednesday, the State had a total of 2,607 COVID-19 positive patients with 2,233 of them having been discharged.

Data uploaded by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said that COVID-19 had claimed 1,20,010 lives — the eight north-eastern States accounting for 1,627 of them — across the country prior to the death of the Mizoram man.

216,2020/10/28,"Six BSP MLAs rebel in U.P., may leave party","Mayawati aide blames SP for the dramatic development

In a jolt to the BSP on Wednesday, four of the 10 MLAs who had proposed the name of the party’s lone candidate in next month’s Rajya Sabha polls withdrew support amid hints that they may switch sides.

The four MLAs were reportedly accompanied by two others when they met the Returning Officer, submitting in writing that their signatures on senior party leader Ramji Gautam’s nomination papers were forged.

One of the rebels admitted that she met Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, while some others in the group of six — a third of BSP’s strength in the Assembly — expressed dissatisfaction over the way their own party treated them.

They, however, did not specifically target Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati.

Without taking names, a BSP leader indirectly laid the blame for the dramatic development on the SP, with which Ms. Mayawati’s party was in alliance during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

The RO is yet to take a decision but if the forgery claim by four of Mr. Gautam’s 10 proposers is accepted, it could lead to his disqualification.

The BSP had on Monday fielded Mr. Gautam, its national coordinator and Bihar in-charge for the November 9 biennial elections for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats.

The BSP doesn’t have the numbers in the Assembly to win an RS seat on its own but party leaders had indicated that it may get the support of other non-BJP parties.

The four MLAs who submitted an affidavit saying their signatures were forged are Aslam Raini, Aslam Chaudhary, Mujtaba Siddiqui and Hakim Lal Bind. Hargovind Bhargava and Sushma Patel also met the Returning Officer, Mr. Raini told reporters.

The scrutiny of nominations is being undertaken on Wednesday, according to the election schedule.

Mr. Raini and Mr. Siddiqui told reporters that they were unhappy with the interference of the BSP coordinators. “There is no respect in the party for us. I complained about a personal problem recently to our leader Lalji Verma, but to no avail.”

Allahabad MLA Siddiqui made clear that he had no complaints against Ms. Mayawati, Mr. Mujtaba said he has been with the party for 25 years and is a three-term MLA.

Shravasti MLA Aslam Raini said when he recently contracted COVID-19 and posted a video clip from the hospital, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath came to his help and this was disliked by his own party men.

“I was in hospital and the BSP coordinators were moving about in my constituency telling people not to meet their MLA,” he claimed.

“It’s the same problem with all six of us. Behenji [Ms. Mayawati] is not to be blamed but the coordinators have acted in a manner which has depressed us and we thought what is the use of remaining with such a party,” the MLA said.

When asked about the future course of action, Mr. Raini said there is a general impression that SP chief Akhilesh Yadav gives respect to his party men.

There were also reports that after meeting the Returning Officer, the BSP MLAs drove to the Samajwadi Party office to meet Mr. Yadav. Later, two of them told reporters that there was no such meeting.

Ms. Sushma Patel, however, admitted meeting the SP chief who she claimed had called them. But she refused to elaborate.

Senior BSP leader and MLA Uma Shankar Singh indirectly blamed the SP for Wednesday’s developments.

Mr. Singh claimed that nomination of industrialist Prakash Bajaj for the Rajya Sabha, filled just two minutes before the deadline Tuesday, was part of a conspiracy .

Mr. Bajaj is contesting as an independent.

They are out to buy MLAs and felt why not get the nomination of the BSP candidate rejected, Mr. Singh said.

He said the rebels were with party workers till the morning and wondered what could have happened in a short while for them to change their minds.

They were with us all through the nomination process. We have sent the pictures of the nomination to the Returning Officer, he said, asserting that the MLAs were present when Mr. Gautam’s papers were filed.

If they had any objection, they should have given it to the RO by yesterday. Why now? Mr. Singh asked.

Everyone knows how this has happened. They cannot take such a big step without any allurement. They should tell how much they got, Mr. Singh added, insinuating horse-trading of the MLAs.

Altogether, 11 candidates, including eight from the BJP, have filed their papers for the 10 Rajya Sabha seats.

Given the overwhelming strength of the BJP in the UP Assembly, all eight candidates including Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri are expected to be elected.

Of the 10 seats, three were earlier held by the BJP, four by the SP, two by the BSP and one by the Congress.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5-bsp-mlas-withdraw-support-to-partys-rajya-sabha-nominee/article32962147.ece
217,2020/10/28,"Will not allow ‘Miya Museum’ in Assam, says BJP","Congress MLA Sherman Ali Ahmed had proposed the museum reflecting the culture and heritage of people living on sandbars with reference to a recommendation by a panel of legislators

The Bharatiya Janata Party in poll-bound Assam has said it will not allow any museum on culture and heritage of the people living on ‘char-chaporis’ to be set up at the Srimanta Sankaradeva Kalakshetra, the showcase of Assamese culture in Guwahati named after a 15th-16th century Vaishnavite saint-reformer.

‘Char’ in Assamese means sandbar while ‘chapori’ is flood-prone riverbank.

“Why should a ‘char-chapori’ museum be established at the Kalakshetra? No community barring the minorities live on the ‘chars’ and all of us know where most of them are from,” State BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass told journalists on Tuesday.

“Under no circumstances will the BJP allow such a museum that may hurt the self-esteem of the Assamese people,” he added while accusing Congress MLA Sherman Ali Ahmed of triggering the controversy for polarising the people on religious lines.

Mr. Dass defended the BJP legislators who were part of the 16 members of the Departmentally Related Standing Committee (DRSC) that had recommended the museum in its report to the Assembly on March 24. The committee headed by AGP lawmaker Utpal Dutta had six MLAs of the BJP.

“Only five of the MLAs were present at the DRSC meeting, which anyway can only make recommendations that are not binding on the government,” Mr. Dass pointed out.

He also said the DRSC did not mention any ‘Miya Museum’ that Mr. Ahmed referred to in his posts and interviews.

“The Congress MLA used the term because his party wants to create a controversy,” Mr. Dass said.

But the newly-formed Asom Jatiya Parishad slammed the BJP for stoking a controversy over the museum after its own MLAs had been part of the panel that had recommended it. “This is damage control to save face,” said former BJP leader and AJP coordinator Jagadish Bhuyan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rrngna/article32961718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ASSAMRIVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/will-not-allow-miya-museum-in-assam-says-bjp/article32961719.ece
218,2020/10/28,Chirag Paswan’s video shoot after father’s death triggers row,"A purported video of LJP president Chirag Paswan rehearsing for a video message a day after the death of his father Ram Vilas Paswan has gone viral

He jokes, talks about ‘cuts and edits’ in Bollywood parlance, and even the ‘texture’ of hair, as he stands in front of the smiling portrait of his father Ram Vilas Paswan.

A purported video of LJP president Chirag Paswan rehearsing for a video message a day after the death of his father, one of the foremost Dalit leaders Bihar produced after Jagjivan Ram, has gone viral.

The 37 years old LJP chief, embarrassed over the development that came less than 24 hours before Bihar votes in the first phase of assembly polls, reacted with indignation and accused Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of “stooping so low”, suggesting that he suspected the JD(U) president’s hand in the damaging video.

In the nearly two-minute clip, shot before he got his head tonsured as a sign of bereavement, the Jamui MP can be seen standing in front of a garlanded portrait of his late father, donning white clothes worn as part of mourning.

Chirag, who has pulled out of the NDA in Bihar vowing to oust Nitish Kumar from power while, paradoxically, helping his junior ally BJP in the state to form the next government, can be heard bantering with his associates about people having .

“different textures of hair“.

“You people will do the cut and edit part. I will include a line about our candidates (in the video),” Chirag Paswan is purportedly seen as telling the camera crew while asking if a single or a double camera was being used.

Senior JD(U) leader Neeraj Kumar, who is also the state’s Information and Public Relations Department Minister, came out with a statement dripping with sarcasm.

“It has been our parampara (tradition), our sanskaar (value system) to serve our fathers. But look at actors of the new generation who get busy with shooting immediately after their father’s death,” Kumar said, without naming anybody, but obviously taking a swipe at Chirag’s unsuccessful attempt to make it in Bollywood before joining politics.

He also said the video presented “a shameful facet of dynasty politics where one’s own father becomes a tool for setting political agenda“.

“Take to serving the people, mister. Politics is about hard reality, not the make-believe world of acting,” Kumar added, twisting the knife.

The LJP chief came out with a flurry of tweets alleging that the controversy had been triggered at the behest of the Bihar chief minister to “divert public attention“.

“I had to release the first list of my party candidates within six hours of my father’s death. I had to fulfil all my duties in capacity of the party president without stepping out of my home for 10 days. So I had no choice but to shoot the video for digital campaign,” he tweeted.

“Do I have to prove to Nitish Kumar how much grief the death of Papa has caused me,” Paswan asked indignantly in another tweet and added “I had been shooting videos on a daily basis. What other option did I have, at a time when campaign for elections was picking up“.

“I had never imagined that the Chief Minister can stoop so low. I am appalled. This attempt at diverting public attention from the incident at Munger would not be successful,” said the LJP chief referring to the violence that rocked the Bihar district Monday night during immersion of Durga idols, killing one person and injuring many.

Bihar BJP chief Sanjay Jaiswal, whose party was said to be tacitly approving of Paswan’s rebellion before deciding to drop him like a hot potato, reacted with bemusement.

“I can only say Chirag Paswan is a fine actor. A reason why movies were his first choice,” Jaiswal said with a smirk when asked about the video.

“The people of the state will never forgive this,” asserted Paswan, ending his tweet with the hashtag .

220,2020/10/28,Four die after consuming adulterated liquor in Odisha,"Four persons died after allegedly consuming adulterated liquor in Odisha’s Angul district.

The Angul police have arrested the main accused. While one of the two accomplices of the accused fell victim to contaminated liquor, the other accused was undergoing treatment in a hospital.

The incident took place at Pathargarh village under the Purunakote police station limit of Angul district.

“As per preliminary investigation, the contractor tried to extract additional work from labourers by providing liquor. He had perhaps added some spurious substance to make liquor more intoxicant. All four victims are labourers,” Anjan Kumar Manik, State Excise Commissioner, told The Hindu on phone.

“As per the complaint, Kalia Dehury is a building contractor. He took a contract of construction of a house in Pathargarh village. He had engaged about 15-20 labourers for the work. In addition to payment, he used to give labourers liquor made by him,” said the Angul police.

“Kalia Dehury manufactured distilled liquor illicitly in the forest of Pathargarh. He was assisted by Basant Dehury and Sashikant Dehury in making liquor,” the police said.

Basant and Sashikant, who were also engaged in the construction work as labourers, had also consumed liquor after day’s work.

“We have received information that four persons have died including one accused Sashikant Dehury,” said the Angul police. Basant Dehury is admitted to hospital.

A post-mortem of two bodies has been conducted and viscera preserved. Blood samples of the victims have been collected.

The three other victims were identified as Kaira Pradhan, Tukuna Pradhan and Pramod Sahu.

222,2020/10/28,Bimal Gurung’s return from exile stirs political pot in Darjeeling hills,"TMC has to maintain a delicate balance as Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) founder extends support to it

The political temperature of Darjeeling is soaring this autumn with rallies and posters making a comeback to the picturesque hills. The return of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) founder Bimal Gurung from exile and his political U-turn has changed the three-year status quo prevailing in the hills. After three years, Mr. Gurung made an appearance in Kolkata on October 21 and announced severing ties with the BJP. He said he wants to see Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee return to power again in 2021.

Over the past few days, the supporters of GJM leader Bimal Tamang have held rallies saying they do not want Mr. Gurung to return to the hills. The Binay Tamang faction of the GJM holds sway over the hills by the control over the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) — the regional autonomous body of the hills. Anit Thapa, chairman of the GTA and close aide of Mr. Tamang said the people of the hill want peace and Mr. Gurung is not welcome.

“The people want peace. They don’t want him to return as it would mean the beginning of strike and violence again,” Mr. Thapa said. While the faction will try to build public opinion against Mr. Gurung’s return, there are supporters of the GJM founder who are enthused with his return.

“Bimal Gurung is the face of the Gorkhaland movement. His return is very much desired in the hills,” a leader close to him said. The hills have occasionally seen violent movements of separate statehood since the mid 1980s. In 2017, the region witnessed a 100-day shutdown and over a dozen of lives were lost in the violent stir.

Along with Mr. Tamang, the return of Mr. Gurung will pose a challenge to the BJP which has made significant electoral gains in the region. In 2019, its Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat nominee Raju Bista won the seat with a margin of over 4.10 lakh votes, highest for any candidate in the State.

Neeraj Zimba, MLA of Darjeeling who won with the BJP support in the 2019 bypolls, also expressed his reservation over the developments involving Mr. Gurung. “The man who was so loved and trusted by the people of the hills has betrayed his people,” he said.

With both Mr. Gurung and Mr. Tamang now supporting the Trinamool Congress, the BJP is looking for newer allies before the 2021 Lok Sabha polls.

While Mr. Gurung’s support to Ms. Banerjee may be a welcome development for the Trinamool Congress, the ruling party will have to do a delicate balancing act.

On one hand the TMC hopes to reap political dividends in the 2021 Assembly polls with the support of Mr. Gurung. On the other, it cannot appear to be conceding the demand of separate state of Gorkhaland, a demand which Mr. Gurung reiterated on October 21. If the TMC is seen going soft on the demand of Gorkhaland, it can be counterproductive to the party’s electoral fortunes in the rest of the State. It has maintained that it will not allow bifurcation of West Bengal on any condition.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wbaevz/article32958556.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIMALGURUNG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bimal-gurungs-return-from-exile-stirs-political-pot-in-darjeeling-hills/article32958557.ece

225,2020/10/28,Tough fight likely in Baroda bypoll,"The seat is considered a Cong. stronghold, but the BJP wants to make inroads

As the Baroda Assembly seat in Haryana’s Sonipat district goes to the poll on November 3, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, backed by its alliance partner the Jannayak Janta Party, seem to be poised for a tough battle even as the former looks placed a tad comfortable than its rivals.

As campaigning for the bypoll is at its peak in the constituency, considered to be a stronghold of the Congress, the BJP would want to make inroads into the Jat-dominated constituency. On the other hand, for the Congress, retaining its traditional seat would be self-assurance about its hold in State politics.

The death of Congress’s sitting MLA Krishan Hooda in April this year had necessitated the bypoll.

‘In Jat belt’

“The Baroda constituency is in the predominantly Jat belt and the ‘Hoodas’ command a good hold across this region. The Congress definitely has an edge as the seat is its stronghold. Besides, Independent candidates’ — Kapoor Narwal’s and Joginder Mor’s — withdrawal in support of the Congress candidate is an added advantage,” said Kushal Pal, head of the Department of Political Science with Dyal Singh College in Karnal.

“The BJP has once against fielded Yogeshwar Dutt, who does not have any baggage, besides Chief Minister Manohar Lal has a clean image, which goes in the party’s favour. The BJP has fielded a non-Jat candidate, which indicates their strategy to play around consolidation of the non-Jat voters. The consolidation would have benefited the BJP, however, given the ongoing resentment among farmers against the Centre’s recent farm laws, the consolidation looks unlikely,” he said.

Vijay Chauhan, assistant professor and head of the Department of Political Science, Maharana Pratap National College, Mullana, said the Baroda by-election is a litmus test for the ruling BJP-JJP while for the Congress, it’s a matter of pride. “The result would be a reflection on performance of the BJP-JJP alliance. For the Congress, there is a pressure of retaining the seat.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tough-fight-likely-in-baroda-bypoll/article32958476.ece

229,2020/10/28,"Pakistan, Zimbabwe begin 2023 WC qualification bid","Face off in Rawalpindi in their opening Super League series

Former world champion Pakistan hosts Zimbabwe in the ICC men’s World Cup Super League series in Rawalpindi from Friday as the teams begin their qualification campaign for the 2023 World Cup, scheduled to be held in India.

A record of losing just one out of 19 ODIs over six previous home series against Zimbabwe would give new captain Babar Azam confidence ahead of their opening series of the Super League, introduced to bring context to ODI cricket and to confirm the top seven teams with direct spots for the World Cup along with host India.

Featuring 13 teams, the 12 ICC full members and the Netherlands, who qualified by winning the ICC World Cricket League Championship 2015-17, the Super League will see sides play eight three-match series each, four at home and four away.

Second chance

The sides failing to qualify directly will get a second shot through a Qualifier.

Each team gets 10 points for a win, five for a tie / no result / abandonment and none for a loss. Teams will be ranked according to total points earned across the eight series.

England on top

England, which on the ICC men’s World Cup as host last year, leads the points table with 30 points after featuring in both series played so far. It beat Ireland 2-1 before losing to Australia by the same margin last month.

230,2020/10/28,IPL 2020 | ‘We have to change things quickly’: Ricky Ponting,"Delhi Capitals coach Ponting says the team has got some work to do on its all-round game

Delhi Capitals coach Ricky Ponting conceded that chasing is an area of concern for his team and it needs to hit the “reset” button to seal an IPL playoff spot in the remaining two league games after enduring a third straight loss, this time to Sunrisers Hyderabad, on Tuesday.

“It’s been a concern. When we decide to bowl first, we’ve given away big totals. We have to get better at that, we need to be better at bowling first and at chasing totals because so far, it hasn’t worked for us,” said Ponting during the post-match press conference.

Do a reset

“We had a rough idea from the start of the game on how many points one might need to qualify. We got to seven wins quite quickly, and now lost three in a row. We have to reset right now,” Ponting said.

“We play MI next and RCB in the last match and if we keep playing the way we are, we will find it hard to win those games. So we have to change things and change them quickly,” said Ponting.

“We’ve got some work to do on our all-round game. Out-fielding has been a bit sloppy and our batsmen have struggled to find any sort of rhythm.”

Chasing a big target, DC had promoted Marcus Stoinis and Shimron Hetmyer up the order ahead of skipper Shreyas Iyer and Rishabh Pant.

Rationale

“Chasing 220, with Rahane and Shikhar at the top, we thought if we lost an early wicket, we would have to match them (SRH) in the PowerPlay and get to 65 or 70,” the former Australian captain said.

“Stoinis has been in sensational form so far, he was dying for an opportunity at the top-order. It didn’t come off today but it was all circumstantial because we were chasing such a big total. It was a bit of experimentation.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/as8w6r/article32965892.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29CAPITALS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/we-have-to-change-things-quickly/article32965893.ece
231,2020/10/28,"IPL 2020 | Bumrah and Suryakumar dominate RCB, put MI in the clear","Quick’s fantastic spell and No. 3 batsman’s imperious 79 n.o. fetch defending champion its eighth win; Padikkal’s sparkling 74 goes in vain

Suryakumar Yadav showed what the Indian side may miss in Australia, coming up with a superlative batting effort (79 n.o., 43b, 10x4, 3x6) to lead Mumbai Indians to a five-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bangalore at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.

MI is now up to 16 points and has two games left. No team with as many points has missed out on a top-four spot in an eight-team IPL.

Jasprit Bumrah (4-1-14-3) played no less a part than Suryakumar, bowling a superb 2-1-5-2 spell at the death to restrict RCB to just 164 after the latter was 129 for two after 15 overs.

Taking charge

During the chase, MI, sans Rohit Sharma, was lumbering, scoring at a rate of just over six in the first nine overs. It was then that the prolific Suryakumar took over, sweeping Yuzvendra Chahal for a six and a four in the 10th. Saurabh Tiwary fell to a stunning catch by Devdutt Padikkal at mid-off, but Suryakumar was unaffected, hitting Chahal over cover for six and then smashing three fours off Dale Steyn.

With 48 required from five overs, Suryakumar slammed three more boundaries, this time off Mohammed Siraj, with a flick, a drive and an upper-cut.

Perhaps bored at the other end, Hardik Pandya hit a six, engaged in a verbal duel with Chris Morris and was dismissed before Suryakumar finished things off by lifting Siraj over the infield.

Earlier, after being put in to bat, RCB rode on Padikkal’s fine half-century (74, 45b, 12x4, 1x6). Josh Philippe (33, 24b, 4x4, 1x6) joined Padikkal at the top after Aaron Finch was dropped, and the two scored at nine an over in the PowerPlay.

However, the cheap dismissals of Kohli and A.B. de Villiers hurt RCB. The skipper tried to pull a short ball from Bumrah, but connected with it too high on the bat. Tiwary completed a fine running catch from short mid-wicket for the speedster’s 100th IPL wicket. de Villiers, after warming up with a scooped six, fell to a wobbly full toss from Kieron Pollard.

Bumrah pinned RCB down with a double-wicket maiden (17th over) that included the prized scalp of Padikkal. RCB barely raised its head thereafter.

MI 99 for three

MI was 99/3 in 13 overs, with Suryakumar (40) and Krunal (7) at the crease.

de Kock (18), Ishan (25) and Tiwary (5) were dismissed

Bumrah’s 1 & 100

Kohli, who was Bumrah’s first IPL wicket, also became his 100th during their match on Wednesday

232,2020/10/28,IPL 2020 | Desperate KKR eye victory against CSK to stay in playoffs race,"If the top-order fires, KKR will be better served as inconsistency has hurt the team in the course of the season, as has the constant chopping and changing.

Already out of the play-offs reckoning, a relaxed Chennai Super Kings are ready to play party-poopers with an aim to foil Kolkata Knight Riders’ desperate bid for a victory in an Indian Premier League game on Thursday.

KKR with 12 points from 12 games would like to win the next two encounters to ensure a smooth passage while CSK, currently at the bottom of the eight-team table, are only playing for pride.

A possibility remains that multiple teams will end up on either 16 or 14 points and a comprehensive victory at this stage of the tournament, will bring the superior net run-rate into equation when the play-off spots are decided.

It won’t get too easy for KKR against CSK, who handed an eight-wicket thrashing to Royal Challengers Bangalore in their previous outing.

KKR’s unsettled batting order is a point of concern for Eoin Morgan, who would hope that former skipper Dinesh Karthik produces his A game when it matters most.

Nitish Rana, who shone in the win over Delhi Capitals, came a cropper in the subsequent loss to Kings XI Punjab.

If the top-order fires, KKR will be better served as inconsistency has hurt the team in the course of the season, as has the constant chopping and changing.

The bowlers have done a good job so far, with Tamil Nadu’s mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy being impressive and earning a spot in the Indian T20 team.

They need to be at the top of their game against the CSK batting unit that has been frustratingly inconsistent but is more than capable of being destructive on its day.

Paceman Pat Cummins, the Knight Riders’ costliest buy, has not been able to make the desired impact with the ball save for one game and would need to put his hand up in this crucial match.

Against CSK, which is missing out on the play-offs for the first time ever, Kolkata’s batting faces a varied attack which was boosted with the inclusion of Mitchell Santner in the last game and needs to step up.

CSK, on its part, will be aiming to build on the win over RCB and end the season on a high, apart from hurting the chances of play-off hopefuls.

The batting showed some spark with the young Ruturaj Gaikwad coming up with an enterprising knock and skipper Dhoni will be hoping he keeps the good form going.

The CSK bowlers choked a strong RCB batting unit with a performance that reminded CSK of yore and that should be a worry for the KKR batsmen short on consistency.

For CSK, any win would be welcome as they endured a forgettable season which is just about to wind down.

England’s World Cup-winning captain Morgan will hope to lead from the front but that would call for a collective performance.

There is a lot at stake for the Knights and they would settle for nothing less than a big win.

Chennai Super Kings: MS Dhoni (C), M Vijay, Ambati Rayudu, Faf du Plessis, Shane Watson, Kedar Jadhav, Ravindra Jadeja, Lungi Ngidi, Deepak Chahar, Piyush Chawla, Imran Tahir, Mitchell Santner, Josh Hazlewood, Shardul Thakur, Sam Curran, N Jagadeesan, KM Asif, Monu Kumar, R Sai Kishore, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Karn Sharma.

233,2020/10/28,IPL 2020 | Wriddhiman Saha’s groin injury ‘not serious’,"Saha had picked up the niggle during his match-winning innings of 87 off 45 balls against Delhi Capitals on Tuesday

Wriddhiman Saha’s groin injury is “not serious” but his IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad is expected to adopt a cautious approach after consultation with the BCCI’s medical team as the senior wicketkeeper-batsman is Australia-bound after the tournament.

Saha had picked up the niggle during his match-winning knock of 87 off 45 balls against Delhi Capitals on Tuesday and didn’t keep wickets with substitute Shreevats Goswami replacing him. “Unfortunately, he’s got a little groin niggle but hopefully it isn’t too bad,” SRH skipper Warner said.

A senior BCCI source said that all the franchises have been told to be a bit cautious with regards to fitness of national team players.

“It doesn’t look very serious at the moment but there is a three-day gap before Sunrisers’ next game. Let’s keep our fingers crossed,” the official said.

There is a possibility that Saha may be advised to skip the next two games and in case Sunrisers makes it to play-offs, he would be fully fit.

Praise from Tendulkar and Shastri

Sachin Tendulkar lauded Saha’s “under-rated” shot-making while the Indian team’s head coach Ravi Shastri felt his 45-ball 87 was simply “outstanding”.

Saha smashed 12 fours and two sixes for SRH in its 88-run victory over Delhi Capitals, showing his batting skills which have largely gone unnoticed over the years.

“Very smart batting,” Tendulkar tweeted. “I also feel that @Wriddhipops quick scoring ability is invariably underrated,” he also said.

He loved the manner in which Saha was able to improvise his shots. “There was no slogging at all. Played a fantastic innings which I thoroughly enjoyed watching.”

Shastri once again termed him as the world’s best wicketkeeper and praised his batting effort. “To the best Glove Man in the world. Outstanding performance tonight,” Shastri said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/fql6t7/article32957953.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAHAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/srh-likely-to-wait-and-watch-on-wriddhiman-sahas-groin-niggle/article32963168.ece

In Krishnagiri, over 200 party members took part in the protest held as part of the State-wide protests called by VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan to condemn the Centre’s stand on refusing reservations for OBC students in medical admission.

‘Withdraw cases’

The VCK had also called for a protest against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for “malicious” propaganda against Mr. Thirumavalavan for his take on the Manusmriti on the status of women.

The protesters demanded that the cases against Mr. Thirumavalavan be withdrawn. The Cyber Crime Branch of the State police had registered an FIR against him for his remarks on Manusmriti.

In Salem, the party members staged a road roko near the District Collectorate. They alleged that the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test denied opportunity to students from downtrodden communities.

The Supreme Court’s recent order declining reservation for students this year was a setback to the students. The delay in providing reservation would shatter the dreams of thousands of students who aspired to become doctors. The protesters were removed by the police and lodged in a marriage hall.

242,2020/10/28,"More MSMEs to be involved in defence, aerospace sectors","They should look at exploring export opportunities, says Defence Secretary

The Union Government is looking at doubling the number of Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs) in the defence and aerospace sectors in the next four to five years, Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar said here on Wednesday.

Launching defence activities through the Codissia Defence Innovation and Atal Incubation Centre (CDIIC) at a virtual meet, he said the industrial eco-system and Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Coimbatore should now get into the defence and aerospace sectors, which are at a watershed moment in the country.

With several initiatives of the government to indigenise and encourage innovation in the sectors, there were huge opportunities for MSMEs. The units should look at not just producing for the Indian needs but also explore export opportunities. Global OEMs are open to sourcing from India, he said.

Mr. Ajay Kumar exhorted the MSMEs to ensure that the products that they made were of high quality and cost-effective. Further, testing and certification procedures need to be bench-marked against the best in the world. “This is an area we need to start doing some work. The cost should come down for testing and certification and there can be tremendous use of technology for it. The Codissia (Coimbatore District Small Industries Association) and CDIIC should partner with the government to identify other areas that can be taken up under indigenisation and innovation,” he said.

Mission Director of Atal Innovation Mission Ramanan Ramanathan said the mission had selected 100 centres, including the one set up in Coimbatore. The aim was to create world class start-ups and provide facilities for them to develop the best products.

K. Gopal, MSME Secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu, said the State government was taking a lot of efforts to push Defence-related activities in the Defence corridor in the State.

V. Sundaram, director of CDIIC, said 10 incubatees would be selected for incubation this year and four of them had been identified. Another six would be finalised soon. The CDIIC would look at having testing and prototyping facilities too. He urged the government to come out with a single tender process for MSMEs.

R. Ramamurthy, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association, said the plan was to make Coimbatore a Defence hub in another 10 years.

The CDIIC signed agreements with 5 Base Repair Depot, Air Force and Naval Ship Repair Yard, Kochi, for indigenisation of their components and products. Rear Admiral Deepak Bansal, Admiral Superintendent of Yard, Naval Ship Repair Yard, Indian Navy, and Air Commodore P.K. Sreekumar, Air Officer, Commanding, 5 Base Repair Depot, Indian Air Force, were present at the launch event.

A press release from NSRY said, the MoU allowed it to use world class facilities of MSMEs based in Coimbatore for hardware development, material testing and analysis and obsolescence mitigation programmes in respect of legacy equipment.

People living in the hill areas of Guthiyalathur and Koothampalayam panchayats in Sathyamangalam block will soon be able to cross the two forest streams along Kadambur – Makkampalayam Road without any difficulty, as a tender is expected to be floated for the construction of two high-level bridges at an outlay of ₹ 6.39 crore.

As many as 21,750 people live in the revenue hamlets in the two panchayats located inside the Guthiyalathur reserve forest and about 20.90 km from the Kadambur bus stand.

During rainy season, flash floods in Guthiyalathur Pallam and Sakkarai Pallam suspends movement of people between Makkampalayam and Kadambur. Construction of bridges across the streams has been a long-pending demand of the residents.

The Block Development Office, with the due permission from the District Forest Officer, Sathyamangalam, has submitted a proposal to the State government for technical sanction. Administrative sanction has been obtained for the project.

While the bridge at Sakkarai Pallam is to be constructed at ₹ 335.50 lakh, the bridge at Guthiyalathur Pallam will come up at ₹ 303.50 lakh with funding under NABARD scheme 2019-20.

District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) sources said that sanction order was expected in the coming weeks after which tender will be floated for the construction work.

Under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, the BDO office had sought approval from the Central government for formation of a 7-km road for which six hectare forest land is to be utilised and compensatory revenue land had also been identified at Arigiyam hamlet. Officials said that the application would be submitted for approval of the Standing Committee of the National Board for the Wildlife.

248,2020/10/28,MSMEs seek direct interest subvention benefit,"Association requests RBI to consider overdraft loan as fresh loan

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should allow Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs) to claim 2 % interest subvention directly for loans availed between February 2, 2018 and March 31, 2020 from banks, said the Coimbatore Compressor Industries’ Association.

In a memoradum to the RBI, the Association president M. Raveendran said the Central Government announced the scheme for MSMEs two years ago and the RBI issued a circular last February outlining guidelines to the banks for the scheme. Recently, the RBI issued another circular saying that co-operative banks will also implement the scheme and said the validity of the scheme has been extended till March 31 next year.

In a reply to the Association, the Small Industries Development Bank of India said that ₹825 crore was disbursed so far under the scheme in the country. But, no MSME entrepreneur in Coimbatore has benefited, claimed Mr. Raveendran. “It is the duty of the bankers concerned to claim the 2 % interest amount through SIDBI and disburse it to the eligible MSMEs,” he said.

Bankers here should take steps to pass on the benefits of the schemes to the MSMEs.

Mr. Raveendran urged the RBI to clarify whether the scheme would be implemented by all scheduled commercial banks and eligible MSMEs till the end of March next year, to look at disbursing the benefits directly to the MSMEs, and also clarify on fresh loans. Bankers said that interest subvention was eligible only for fresh loans obtained after November 2. The overdraft facility was subjected to renewal by the banker every year.

“We request the RBI to consider the overdraft loan as a fresh loan and extend interest subvention from the renewal date,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/msmes-seek-direct-interest-subvention-benefit/article32958613.ece

Farmers’ Association has appealed to the uzhavar sandhai authorities to have more transparency in the price list announced for agricultural produce that are sold at the markets.

State secretary of the Association P. Kandasamy said in a press release that the uzhavar sandhais were started to help the farmers and the consumers and guidelines were issued on how prices should be fixed. It is usually 20 % more than the wholesale price and 20 % less than then retail price prevailing in a day in a city. The price list should be for top quality.

But, over the years, traders also started selling at the sandhais, he said. Mr. Kandasamy alleged that not many farmers sell directly now at the uzhavar sandhais. Quality is not given a priority now and there are several irregularities in how the prices are fixed, he claimed. For instance, the price list issued recently at the RS Puram Uzhavar Sandhai said the price of a kg of coconut was ₹42. But, the rate board displayed the rate as ₹45. Consumers do not get the produce at the right price and some retail traders are buying at lower prices, thus affecting the farmers.

After talks were held between the conservancy workers and the municipality, a compromise was reached, officials said, with the contractor agreeing to release a third of the salary due to the staff by the end of the week.

263,2020/10/28,"ED files chargesheet against ex-Indian Nursing Council Member, 12 others","It requests the court for confiscation of the attached assets worth ₹12.60 crore.

The Enforcement Directorate has filed a chargesheet against Mahesh Chand Sharma, a former Member of the Indian Nursing Council, and 12 others in connection with a disproportionate assets case.

Among those arraigned are Mr. Sharma’s wife Meena Devi, sons Mohit and Ankit, family owned companies and trusts.

The entities have been identified as Swastik Seva Sansthan, Safe Infracon Private Limited, Saket Health Education Centre Private Limited and RAG Memorial Trust.

The ED has also requested the court for confiscation of the attached assets worth ₹12.60 crore.

The agency initiated the money-laundering investigation on the basis of an FIR and chargesheet filed by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in Jaipur.

Mr. Sharma earlier worked with the Health and Medical department of the Rajasthan government as nursing tutor in the College of Nursing of SMS Medical College. He was also a Member of the India Nursing Council.

He along with his associate was trapped by ACB officers while allegedly accepting a bribe of ₹5 lakh from a nursing institute for adding its name on the Council’s website.

The police probe revealed that the accused amassed ₹10.60 crore disproportionate to his income from known sources.

The ED found that the ill-gotten money was invested in agricultural land, a residential flat and plots, held in the name of the accused, his family members, company and trust.

It is alleged that Lal Chand Morani, Rajendra Prasad Saini, Kishan Lal Saini and Saket Health Education Centre helped Mr. Sharma in the money laundering.

264,2020/10/28,Coronavirus | Delhi schools to remain closed till further orders: Manish Sisodia,"The Delhi government had earlier announced that schools will remain closed till October 31

All schools in Delhi will continue to be closed till further orders in view of the COVID-19 situation, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced on Wednesday.

Parents are not in favour of reopening schools either, Sisodia said at an online press conference.

The Delhi government had earlier announced that schools will remain closed till October 31.

“We keep getting feedback from parents that they are really concerned about whether it is safe to reopen schools. It is not. Wherever schools have reopened, COVID-19 cases among children have risen. So we have decided that as of now schools in the national capital will not reopen. They will continue to be closed till further orders,” Sisodia said.

Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.

A nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25.

While several restrictions have been eased in different ‘unlock’ phases, educational institutions continue to remain closed. According to ‘Unlock 5’ guidelines, states can take a call on reopening schools in phases. Several states have also begun the process of reopening schools.

Earlier, schools were allowed to call students from Class 9 to 12 to school on voluntary basis from September 21.

265,2020/10/28,Shameful that civic bodies not releasing doctors’ salaries: CM,"Kejriwal says Centre should give ₹12,000 crore to Delhi municipal corporations

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal launched an all-out attack on BJP-run civic bodies on Tuesday stating that the protest by municipal doctors who have allegedly not been paid their salaries for several months was “shameful”.

The move comes a day after the Mayors of the three civic bodies staged a protest outside Mr. Kejriwal’s official residence demanding dues worth ₹13,000 crore.

Mr. Kejriwal said that the Centre should grant funds to the civic bodies so that salaries of doctors and other workers can be released.

According to Delhi government sources, ₹1,965.91 crore was due to the municipalities between April 1 and October 26, out of which ₹1,752.61 crore had already been paid, and the remainder had already been disbursed and was in the process of being credited to the municipal corporations as per records of the Urban Development Department.

‘Civic bodies owe govt’

“The civic doctors are on strike due to non-payment of salaries for many months now. This is utterly shameful. The doctors who risked their lives to protect, treat, and serve us and our families, this is not right. This is a very sensitive matter, and there should be no politics on the issue,” the CM said.

“The civic bodies owe us ₹3,800 crore, which were given in the form of loans by the Delhi government. They also owe ₹3,000 crore in bills to the Delhi Jal Board. The Centre gives grants to all municipal corporations across the country, based on ₹485 per person. However, the Centre is not paying grants to the three Delhi civic bodies for the last few years,” said Mr. Kejriwal.

Since the population of Delhi is 2.25 crore, the per year calculation comes to ₹1,100-₹1,200 crore (according to ₹485 per person) which amounts to ₹12,000 crore for 10 years, Mr. Kejriwal said, adding that the Centre should give the money to the civic bodies “how else will they function”.

Out of the ₹12,000 crore, ₹6,000 crore is for salaries.

Mr. Kejriwal further said the Delhi government was also suffering from an economic loss because of the coronavirus pandemic and no tax collection.

“But still, we are managing the situation. We have not stopped salaries of our workers, including teachers,” he said, adding: “I want to appeal to the Centre, the doctors are suffering as they have not gotten salaries for many months now. In time of pandemic, when we should be rewarding them with medals for being on duty, they are not getting their salaries.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/g9pz8/article32959863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE27LEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shameful-that-civic-bodies-not-releasing-doctors-salaries-cm/article32959864.ece
266,2020/10/28,Group demands probe into gang-rape case,"Team seeks medical attention for girls

Bekhauf Azaadi, Chandigarh-based women collective, has demanded a judicial probe on the allegations of gangrape of a Dalit girl and sexual harassment of her cousin in police custody in Sonipat’s Butana earlier this year.

A five-member fact-finding team from the collective, in its report, also sought immediate medical attention for the two girls and an independent probe by different commissions for human rights, women and minorities. The girls were arrested in connection with the murder of two policemen on June 30 in Butana village. The two were allegedly part of a gang of six persons — accused of murdering the two policemen. The prime accused, Amit, was later shot in an encounter.

The two girls surrendered, as per the fact-finding team report, and one of them was then allegedly raped by a dozen policemen. Her cousin was also stripped and assaulted. The victim’s mother registered a case in this connection at Sonipat Women police station. The girls are now in judicial custody.

The fact-finding team said the murders should not be confused with the custodial gangrape of the victim. “At a time when we are witnessing erosion of long fought rights of survivors in matters of sexual violence whether it is in Hathras incident or Gurmandi case in Delhi, it is all the more important to recognise that patriarchy creates conditions that makes it more difficult to believe survivors in such matters,” the report concluded.

“The custodial and caste violence, actions of the police officers, continued harassment of the family members, cannot be ignored and need to be condemned. At each step, these police officers belonging to dominant caste have tried to intimidate the family by making assertions that they will never be able to prove anything against the police officers,” the report further said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/group-demands-probe-into-gang-rape-case/article32959860.ece

Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Tuesday alleged that the Capital’s farmers were unhappy over the non-payment of their crop in mandis in accordance with the minimum support price (MSP) set by the Centre.

Mr. Bidhuri said the farmers had decided to launch a movement against the Arvind Kejriwal-led government a week later according to a decision to this effect at the Kisan Khat Mahapanchayat organised in Narela earlier during the day.

“There is a lot of resentment among the farmers that millet is being purchased in the mandis of Delhi at ₹1,000/quintal while its fixed MSP is ₹2,200/quintal. Similarly, farmers are being given a price of ₹1,500/quintal for paddy while the fixed MSP is ₹1,880/quintal,” he alleged.

Mr. Bidhuri said the biggest reason for the resentment against the Kejriwal government among the farmers was that the Chief Minister himself had announced that his government would pay ₹897/quintal more than the MSP fixed on paddy to the farmers of Delhi but they were not even being given the fixed MSP.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/farmers-unhappy-over-crop-prices/article32959859.ece

Education Minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday visited a government school — Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidhyalaya — in Paschim Vihar after five of its students secured admissions in the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology. Also, 22 students from the school managed to clear the NEET examinations.

Mr. Sisodia, also the Deputy Chief Minister, congratulated the school principal and teachers and also discussed how the success of the school can be replicated in other Delhi government schools.

“The best practices from this school should be adopted by other schools so that we can repeat and multiply this success. It is the dream of the Chief Minister that every child of Delhi should get such exciting and valuable opportunities to enhance their talent and make the country proud,” Mr. Sisodia said.

Mr. Sisodia added that five years ago the Delhi government dreamt of providing quality education and now, with the 98% result in the Class XII board examination results, and the scale of success in JEE and NEET, that “dream was coming true”.

‘Quality of govt. schools’

“This also shows that the quality of government schools in Delhi has become very high. We have to learn from these successes to make Delhi’s education revolution so effective that it will not only inspire our country but the entire world,” Mr. Sisodia said.

Teachers at the school told the Minister that they had to make a conscious effort to change the perception among children that to succeed in JEE, NEET, one needs to enrol in expensive coaching centres.

A day after the Mayors of the three civic bodies sat on a dharna outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s official residence, the Opposition BJP on Tuesday accused the CM of troubling the “poor citizens of Delhi” by “harassing the municipalities.”

Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta requested the Delhi government to “not do politics” and “not harass” ‘corona warriors’ such as doctors, nurses and sweepers who are “serving Delhiites without caring for their lives during the ongoing pandemic”.

“If the Delhi government does not release the dues of the civic bodies within the next 10 days, then on the 11th day, the Mayors of all the three corporations will sit on a dharna outside the CM’s residence,” North Corporation Mayor Jai Prakash said.

“The Kejriwal-led government may have political differences with the civic bodies, but what have the civic employees done to the government?” Mr. Jain said.

272,2020/10/28,Waste-to-power plant unveiled in Ghazipur,"It will generate 1,500 units of power

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday inaugurated a 15 tonnes per day waste-to-power plant at Ghazipur poultry market, which will produce electricity through bio-gasification of bio-degradable waste generated from the market.

With the establishment of more such waste-to-power plants, waste will not be disposed of in a landfill and will be recycled and used to generate electricity. It is only through this “judicious recycling” that Delhi can prosper, he said.

“I am glad that the waste-to-power plant is starting today [Tuesday]. The waste generated from the mandi will be used to create electricity,” he said.

“This is a small plant that will combust only 15 tonnes of waste to produce 1,500 units of electricity, however, many such small plants should be established across Delhi. With an existing big waste-to-power plant and the establishment of hundreds of such small plants, the waste should no longer be dumped on these garbage mountains,” he also said.

Mr. Kejriwal said waste should be recycled and turned into compost, used to generate electricity or in brick kilns. It was only through this judicious recycling that Delhi can prosper or these “mountains” of garbage will keep on increasing.

Deputy CM Manish Sisodia took the opportunity to attack the corporations stating that the responsibility of waste management lies with civic bodies but the effectiveness of their management system is questionable.

“The responsibility of the mandi waste management was of the civic body.

273,2020/10/28,Voluntary agency to relocate trees on old secretariat premises,"May take 2 weeks to dig trees, trim and transport to private land in Shamshabad

After having spent a good part of Wednesday in trimming and replanting four 15-year old trees on the roadside which had fallen during the recent rains at the Malaysian Township in Kukatpally, a satisfied Uday Krishna Peddireddi wipes the sweat off his brow as he heads home.

While these were planted at the same location, a bigger task awaits him and the Vata Foundation of which he’s a founder-trustee. The government has decided to allow the voluntary body to relocate 80 fully grown trees from inside the secretariat complex bowing to vociferous demands from green activists. “We have received permission from the Tree Protection Committee (TPC). We will be starting work in the next few days. I reckon it could take about two weeks to dig the trees, trim them and transport them to a private land in Shamshabad. We will need a 80-tonne crane and make at least 60 trips including by a trailer for the 40-km journey,” says 50-year-old Mr. Uday Krishna.

Interestingly, the foundation (vatafoundation@gmail.com) is doing the work free of cost and has only sought government help in uprooting and loading them onto the trucks while the rest of the expenditure like cost of transport and re-plantation will be borne by the private party which is taking them.

“Many people are interested in sponsoring translocation of trees and are even ready to plant them in their own respective plots/properties. We have been repeatedly requesting GHMC, R&B and other departments to permit us to relocate fallen trees or trees likely to be cut down for road widening. Hundreds of trees fell during the recent rain in the twin cities,” he points out.

In fact, he and fellow volunteers of the foundation are keen to ‘save’ trees reportedly permitted to be felled by the TPC inside the secretariat. “Every tree can be saved, irrespective of its age and species. We are trying to get details on the precise number of trees,” says Mr. Uday Krishna.

The foundation has also come to know of many fully grown trees that are likely to be axed on the Gandipet main road for widening and are offering to relocate those too.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/syc4vc/article32966945.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY28-OLDSECRETARIATCOMPLEX,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/voluntary-agency-to-relocate-trees-on-old-secretariat-premises/article32966938.ece
274,2020/10/28,Helping the flood-hit restart their lives,"10 NGOs, social organisations team up to provide daily-need relief material to 6,000 affected families

There is an infectious energy as dozens of young men and women stand, sit, sort and bag relief material to be despatched to the flood-affected areas of Hyderabad. The relief material includes clothes, inner wear, bedsheets, mattresses, dry rations, hygiene kits, toiletries, citronella incense sticks and almost everything else that a family may need.

“We did a survey and found that nearly 6,000 families have lost everything. The current requirement is clothes, bedsheets, mattresses and other things of daily use,” says Sara, one of the coordinators at the relief centre, where 10 NGOs and social organisations have teamed up.

Power of social media

Social media and word-of-mouth publicity played a key role in getting relief material and volunteers. The stock of relief material was enough to damage the glass pane of the re-purposed car showroom.

The relief material is brought from dozens of collection centres set up across the city. “We managed to bring in many NGOs to work with us. We have created a system where the material that is brought in is sorted, catalogued and despatched to different areas,” says Azam Khan, who has helped put together the relief war-room. The most affected areas are pinned to a map on the wall.

While initially food was the major requirement, now the demand is more for bedsheets, mattresses and utensils.

In a different part of the city, Khaleeda Parveen has created a different model for distributing relief material. “The flood-affected people come here, show their identity and locality where they are from and then they pick up clothes of their choice and leave. We also give each family a blanket, bedsheets, a bucket and a mug,” says Ms Parveen of Amoomat Society.

People from Talabkatta, Falaknuma and other areas are travelling to the houses near Salar Jung Colony to collect relief material.

Another NGO is focussing on the flood-affected in Saroornagar, Uppal and Nagaram areas. “We distributed food packets in those areas in the initial days. But now the needs have changed. One of our partnering NGOs has brought in relief material from other cities and we are distributing kits now,” says a volunteer associated with the relief effort.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/k8xfjt/article32966916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy29relief,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/helping-the-flood-hit-restart-their-lives/article32966917.ece
275,2020/10/28,HSIL to invest ₹ 320 crore on facilities in TS,"Sanitaryware firm and leading glass packaging producer HSIL on Wednesday said it will invest ₹ 220 crore on a greenfield specialty glass manufacturing facility in Bhongir and ₹100 crore to augment capacity of its plastic pipes and fittings plant in Sangareddy.

Announcing ₹220 crore investment in AGI Glaspac, part of its packaging products division, HSIL said the proposed facility will be operational by the end of September 2022. It will have a manufacturing capacity of 150 tonnes per day and will include one new furnace with five manufacturing lines spread across 15 acres.

The specialty glass products will cater to industries such as pharmaceuticals, including for vials, and other products such as perfumery, cosmetics and high-end liquor. The facility will be equipped with cutting-edge technology rooted in the principles of digital manufacturing. It will also create job opportunities in the region.

AGI Glaspac has two manufacturing plants in Telangana, one in Sanathnagar here and another in Bhongir with an overall capacity to manufacture 1,600 tonnes container glass per day. Its clients are into alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, fast-moving consumer goods, retail, pharmaceuticals and edible oil space.

HSIL vice-chairman and MD Sandip Somany said the foray into production of specialty glass will further strengthen the company’s footprint in the glass packaging segment. “This segment is set to gain momentum from the increasing marketing strategies and advertisements implemented by high-end perfumery, liquor and cosmetics companies besides. The rising trend of online shopping would also propel the growth,” he said in a statement.

Another release from HSIL said the company will invest ₹100 crore in the plastic pipes and fittings solution business to increase the production capacity at the Sangareddy plant. The aim is to augment the production from 30,000 tonnes to 48,000 tonnes by September, 2022. “The investment of ₹100 crore is a strategic decision to make our production facility more robust and manage the demands in the new normal,” Mr. Somany said.

Despite the ongoing pandemic, there has been a significant increase in the demand of CPVC and UPVC pipes and fittings. The strategic investment will help the company cater to the requirements from the customer base, optimise the lead-time and consistently meet the future demands from various markets, the release said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hsil-to-invest-320-crore-on-facilities-in-ts/article32966887.ece

278,2020/10/28,CSIR cautions against letting guard down,"There’s still far more to uncover: DG

“The only proven way to control the pandemic across the world is following some simple precautions of wearing face masks, personal hygiene and social distancing particularly during these festival times. A lot of ground has been covered in the last 10 months and understanding has begun to emerge leading to new therapies, diagnostics and vaccines about COVID-19 yet, there is still far more to uncover,” said Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) Director General Shekhar C. Mande on Wednesday.

In a communication to all CISR labs across the country, the DG cautioned against people congregating in one place and ensure the homes are as ventilated as possible. “During these festive times we usually witness large gatherings, family reunions, and celebrations. However, this virus has continued to ravage the world, spread wilder than wild fire, and has disrupted every sphere of human activity. With ‘unlock’ and more activities resuming, it is easy to forget the virus and jump into the festivities and celebrate which we all love to do,” he said.

Burden on medical staff

However, people should consider the workload on doctors and healthcare workers working relentlessly to ensure that affected individuals get the best care. “Festival is the time to pay respect to them by making sure that we don’t enhance the burden on them by overlooking the safety measures of containing the spread of the virus,” said Dr. Mande.

Indian scientists have been involved in “exciting developments” like the new diagnostic kit FELUDA developed at CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology; launch of Favipiravir by Cipla with CSIR technology; while findings about treating diseases from the age-old traditional knowledge of the Indian system are expected soon as also in vaccine development.

New lessons every day

“But, there is a still more to learn as there are many perplexing observations about the pandemic,” said the DG. “Why are some asymptomatic and recover on their own? It is not that people below 65 are not affected and people without diabetes are safe as even those without co-morbidities have the possibility of developing severe form of the disease. It clearly establishes the fact that we know little about the virus and the severity that it will hit with any one who comes in contact with the virus,” he warned.

Thus, “it will only be befitting tribute to countless COVID Warriors if we truly observe discipline during the festival season and not lead to explosion of the pandemic because of our complacence,” added the DG.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/csir-cautions-against-letting-guard-down/article32966865.ece
279,2020/10/28,"Govt. plans to increase cultivation of onion, tomato","Officials aked to take steps to prevent repeat of crisis

The State government has asked the Horticulture and Marketing departments to stabilise the extent of cultivation of onion and tomato crops in the State in tune with the demand for the two perishable crops in the State and also keeping in mind the crisis faced every year due to demand-supply variation.

Minister for Agriculture Singireddy Niranjan Reddy, at a review meeting held here on Wednesday with the officials of Agriculture, Marketing and Horticulture departments as also officials of Seed Corporation of Markfed, Warehousing corporation and Agros, wanted the officials to submit a report on the demand-supply-cultivation position of onion and tomato crops.

He asked the officials to examine what kind of incentives and subsidies could be extended to farmers to cultivate the two crops in extents proportionate to the demand within the State after looking into the reasons leading to spiralling of price of the two vegetable crops two-three times every year. He also instructed the officials of the Horticulture department to examine the possibilities of increasing onion cultivation extent and production during the Yasangi season.

The Minister told the marketing department officials to continue the sale of onion at subsidised rate of ₹35 per kg in Rythu Bazaars till the retail sale prices in the market came down. According to officials, both onion and tomato are consumed about 5 lakh tonnes each every year in the State.

On the cultivation of oilpalm, the minister asked the horticulture officials to prepare an action plan on procurement of plants and coverage of planned extent next year. For the current year, plantation of the crop should be completed by November 15.

On the vegetable waste generated in Rythu Bazaars and other vegetable markets, the minister wanted the officials to prepare plans on making it into compost.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/govt-plans-to-increase-cultivation-of-onion-tomato/article32966516.ece
280,2020/10/28,‘People determined to vote Cong.’,"The Telangana Congress has alleged that though the BJP and TRS are trying to put up a show of competing with each other, people believe that they are two faces of the same coin, and they are determined to vote for Congress.

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee Treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy said in a statement that voters of Dubbak were ready to teach a lesson to the ruling party by electing Congress candidate Cheruku Srinivas Reddy given his credentials.

He said people were clear on their resentment against the TRS government and realised the development done by late MLA Cheruku Muthyam Reddy.

Mr. Reddy said the party was rejuvenated under the leadership of Telangana Congress incharge Manickam Tagore and TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy and their efforts would not go in vain.

He reminded how Mr. T. Jeevan Reddy won the Graduate Constituency elections in 2019 just after TRS came to power.

It showed people were fed up with the ruling party and it reflected in the Lok Sabha elections as well.

Narayana Reddy said that the government had failed in providing the infrastructure to face the situation arising out of frontline warriors contracting COVID-19.

The disease was not brought under Arogya Sri Scheme and due to this lakhs of people had faced financial problems.

Moreover, farmers were angry that the government also did not provide any help to those who suffered losses due to the recent incessant rains.

281,2020/10/28,‘TS tops in ryots’ loan waiver’,"KR says BJP, Congress will lose badly in Dubbak

Waiving crop loans to the tune of ₹27,718 crore apart from ₹28,000 crore extended to farmers under Rythu Bandhu scheme, Telangana is the numero uno in the country in serving the interests of farmers, TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao said.

These are the figures revealed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its report and its a great honour for the youngest state in the country, KTR said, adding it was a befitting answer to those who criticised the government with false accusations.

He said the RBI report had clearly stated that the Telangana government was on the top in waiving crop loans in the country. Apart from this, the Rythu Bandhu scheme had put an additional ₹28,000 crore so far in the farmers’ hands. These were above the money spent on Rythu Bheema and free power supply to the agriculture sector.

KTR said the RBI report also made it clear that the beneficiaries under Rythu Bandhu were 95% small and marginal farmers, thus negating the claim that the scheme was benefiting rich farmers. Overall, six lakh farmers’ families had benefited scheme and this was an extraordinary achievement.

Stating that Telangana was the most progressive state in the country, he said contribution of agriculture had increased by 300% in the State’s Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) and it meant agriculture policies of Telangana government had paid off. Moreover, the per capita income in Telangana had more than doubled, the Minister said.

Dubbak poll

KTR claimed that it would be a cake walk for the TRS in Dubbak bypoll and Congress and BJP would struggle to retain their deposits. TRS would better its majority this time, he said stating Congress was nowhere in the picture.

Taking a dig at the BJP leaders and the money confiscated from them by the police, he said BJP leaders claim all the money spent on welfare schemes was theirs but the money caught by the police was not theirs.

282,2020/10/28,BJP pushed economy from slowdown to lockdown: KTR,"‘They are seen more in social media than in society’

TRS working president and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre, stating that it had successfully brought down the Indian economy from slowdown to lockdown mode.

In an informal interaction with reporters here, he said the projected zero percent growth rate was entirely due to the BJP’s failure to manage the economy. For the last eight quarters Indian economy had seen the slowdown and this was much before coronavirus came into the picture. “You have hit the growing economy of India with your inability and also let down people of India,” KTR said.

Taking a dig at the Finance Minister Nirmala Seetharaman’s statement on coronavirus as an “act of God”, he said BJP maked promises, mismanaged and then shifted the blame to others through their “WhatsApp’ university. KTR asked where the two crore jobs promised by the Prime Minister, the ₹15 lakh to be deposited in each account and the assurance of houses to all by 2020 were .

Referring to the claims of BJP State unit that Centre’s contribution to all schemes of the State was huge, he said the party would give even Goebbels a run for his money through fake narratives and propaganda. “They are seen more in social media than in society,” he said challenging the BJP to release a white paper on Central government’s contribution to Telangana.

Mr Rama Rao’s strong reaction came in the backdrop of the money seizure controversy in Dubbak constituency where police confiscated more than ₹18 lakh from the BJP candidate Raghunandan Rao’s relative and the subsequent allegations and counter-allegations by both parties. “BJP believes in creating confusion when it cannot convince.” The BJP leaders had alleged that police was caught while placing the cash in the BJP supporter’s residence to blame them.

‘Will attack PM’

The Minister strong objection to the abusive language used by the BJP cadre on Chief Minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao and said TRS was losing patience and it would be forced to use similar language against Prime Minister Narendra Modi or the Union Ministers.

“We can use abusive language as well,” he said reminding how the Chief Minister prevented people ridiculing the Prime Minister during the lockdown. “We respect institutions.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bjp-pushed-economy-from-slowdown-to-lockdown-ktr/article32966273.ece
283,2020/10/28,Manhunt launched in forest firing case,"We will arrest the accused in a day or two: SP

Vikarabad police have launched a manhunt for the suspect who opened fire in the Dammagudem reserve forest on Friday night, which resulted in the death of a calf.

The offence came to light only after the owner of the cattle found the calf dead and reported the offence at Chengomul police station.

Vikarabad Superintendent of Police M. Narayana said that when the cattle did not return at night after grazing in the forest, owner Ganga Naik went in search of them and found the calf dead. “Both the animals were tied to one halter rope,” he said. The bullet stuck in the calf’s neck was recovered after the carcass was sent for a post-mortem.

The fired round has been sent for ballistic opinion to know more about the weapon from which it was fired. However, Mr. Narayana was tight-lipped about the rumours doing rounds on social media on involvement of family members of a famous sports personality. “We will arrest the accused in a day or two,” he said.

Dentist abducted

A dentist was reportedly kidnapped from his yet-to-be inaugurated clinic at Bandlaguda near Himayatsagar here on Tuesday afternoon.

Rajendra Nagar police said that four persons clad in burqas barged into the premises and took away Dr. Behzad Hassan (55) in a car around 1.45 p.m.

Following a complaint lodged by the doctor’s family member, a case was registered and special teams were formed to identify the suspects and rescue the victim. Sources said that Dr. Hassan’s family received a communication from the kidnappers who demanded ransom.

“We suspect financial disputes to be the reason behind this. However, we cannot comment at this hour. Our teams are making efforts to trace and rescue him,” police said.

285,2020/10/28,"Sluice gates shut for more than 3,000 lakes in RR district","Officials struggled in vain to open them at every lake that brimmed dangerously

An expedient decision two decades ago pertaining to lakes in erstwhile Ranga Reddy district proved costly during recent floods that drowned several localities in GHMC limits and surrounding municipalities.

Orders passed by the district administration over 20 years ago to shut down the sluice gates of several lakes in the district for good, has had repercussions much later, as the officials struggled in vain to open them at every lake that brimmed dangerously owing to the recent spate of excessive rainfall.

Sluice gates of thousands of lakes in the district were shut between 1998 and 2002, a good number with concrete, in order to conserve water during the trying drought conditions prevalent back then.

According to Irrigation department officials, the sluices of more than 3,000 lakes in the district were closed for good, with a view to save the precious resource for essential purposes.

As per the orders, all lakes with less than 100 acres of irrigated extent were to be shut down, and no water there of should be exploited for irrigation. All such lakes were brought under the Panchayat Raj department, and only 250 plus lakes under which the ayacut was over 100 acres, were left with the Irrigation department.

“It was a well meaning decision back then, considering the severe scarcity of drinking water and cattle fodder. Farmers lifted the gates for their requirement, and left them open with no regard for water wastage. The district authorities intended to conserve the water so that ground reserves got recharged in the surrounding localities, solving the drinking water and fodder issues,” shared an official.

During recent floods, scores of lakes in the district overflowed, and with their weirs and surplus channels blocked or encroached upon by colonies and bastis during the intervening years, the only hope left was the sluices.

“Weirs and not the sluices are designed to drain the excess water. Sluices are designed to release controlled flows for irrigation purpose, and their outflow capacity is very low compared with that of the weir. But everywhere, weirs were blocked and surplus courses were heavily constructed, leaving us no choice,” another official said.

While even the sluice courses were thickly occupied by colonies, opening them would not have resulted in devastation as the outflows were meagre. It was a desperate measure looked upon by the officials as the last recourse to save the lakes from breaching. It was, however, not to be so simple.

At Fox Sagar lake, they had to camp for over a week before they could work the sluice open. And in cases such as Gurram Cheruvu lake, which had breached the bund creating midnight mayhem, the sluice was buried under tonnes of debris and soil dumped by land grabbers, and levelled using heavy machinery. While the officials struggled in vain with the weir, the lake surged forth.

At Burhan Khan lake upstream of Gurram Cheruvu, officials were under pressure to drain the lake, but could not work the sluice open.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/f67pz0/article32958533.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-SLUICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/sluice-gates-shut-for-more-than-3000-lakes-in-rr-district/article32958532.ece

Pharma companies Granules India and Laurus Labs will be investing ₹400 crore and ₹300 crore respectively to set up manufacturing facilities in Genome Valley, Hyderabad.

The leadership of the companies met Industries and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao on Tuesday and made the announcement. Their decision is a resounding endorsement of Brand Hyderabad, a release from the Minister’s office said.

Granules will invest ₹400 crore to set up a facility with a capacity to manufacture 10 billion units of Finished Dosages (FDs). The proposed unit will generate employment for about 1,600 persons. The Hyderabad-based company had manufacturing facilities in eight locations and presence in 75 countries. It operates the world’s largest commercial Pharmaceutical Formulation Intermediates (PFI) facility at Gagillapur near here.

The release said Chairman and Managing Director Krishna Prasad Chigurupati met the Minister at Pragathi Bhavan.

Laurus Labs CEO Satyanarayana Chava also met Mr. Rao and announced that the company will be setting up a formulation facility with a capacity of 5 billion units. The company plans to invest ₹300 crore in two phases of ₹150 crore each. In the first phase the plant is expected to provide employment to about 150 persons.

It operates six manufacturing facilities in Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.

Thanking the leadership of the two companies for choosing to invest in Telangana, Mr. Rao said that the State government will provide all possible support to the firms. He said the proactive policies of the State government under the leadership of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao are attracting global leaders in IT, pharma, textiles, aerospace and defence and other sectors to Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana.

288,2020/10/28,Indian Ocean salutes Covid-19 warriors with new song,"The nation’s oldest fusion rock band Indian Ocean, that has recently composed an anthem for ‘Bharat ke Mahaveer’, discusses its upcoming collaborations

When Himanshu Joshi and his family caught COVID-19, he was overwhelmed by how kind humanity can be. “Every meal, groceries we needed... everything came from our neighbours,” recalls the vocalist of one of India’s oldest and pioneer rock bands, Indian Ocean.

The 32-year-old band behind songs such as ‘Desert Rain’, ‘Bandeh’ and ‘Mann Kasturi’, recently paid its tribute to other such selfless COVID-19 heroes with an anthem to the show, Bharat Ke Mahaveer, airing in November on Discovery India. Starring Dia Mirza and Sonu Sood as hosts, it will showcase 12 stories about India’s spirit of solidarity through the pandemic.

While the anthem video honours those who have shown kindness during these troubled times, over a Zoom call, Indian Ocean members Himanshu, Rahul Ram and Amit Kilam recall the people they have personally witnessed in the act of building a more empathetic India.

“I have seen Amit Kilam and his wife go around distributing food packets to migrant workers when the great migration started in April. My wife, who is part of an organisation that works with street dogs, saw how people spontaneously came forward to help,” says Rahul Ram.

Acknowledging that there was an initial stigma against people who tested positive, Amit says, “The same housing society group chat where I could see rash unreasonable behaviour, has now evolved to be more kind. As we see how inevitable it is, people are learning to be less scared.”

Incidentally, Amit, who plays the drums and has also lent his vocals for the anthem, “crossed the Covid speed bump” (as the band members call it), right before they recorded the song. “I didn’t notice it then, but looking back, I do get out of breath while singing longer sections. There are some long-term side effects that need to be monitored, but breathing exercises should help,” he shrugs.

“So the two members who live the healthiest lifestyles caught Covid, whereas Nikhil [Rao] and I did not. Looks like our vices have paid off,” jokes Ram, lightening the mood.

Apart from recording this song in August, the band has not been able to meet very often, despite all of them living in Delhi. “Maybe we will when Himanshu-ji gets better and I come back from Manali,” says Ram, who has temporarily taken to the hills. “Oh yes, right before you called, he was showing us the valleys outside his window. You could call that a random act of unkindness,” Amit says, side-eying his long-time collaborator.

What’s next for the ocean

The inside jokes point to almost half a lifetime of performing together. Known for giving fusion rock a voice, the band stood out for its strong vocals and the incorporation of Indian musical instruments in a formerly westernised genre. In the past few years, however, their live concerts were proving more popular.

They are now doing the same online, something that they think will continue even after live performances return. “We can reach fans in cities we have never played at,” says Ram, explaining the advantages of online concerts with this analogy: “It is like watching cricket on your TV — you get to watch the spin and the strike closely. You are watching better cricket but you miss the energy of 30,0000 people cheering with you. So both are valid experiences and will continue.”

Before the pandemic hit, the band had composed and recorded five songs, ready to be released. Two of them are collaborations — one with ghatam maestro Vikku Vinayakram and the other, with American saxophonist George Brooks.

“But then we realised that nowadays people watch music, rather than listen to it. Half of them watch on their phones, so the bass player wants to kill himself,” laughs Ram, who is the bassist for the band. The band was halfway through recording the videos, when the country went into lockdown.

“And then there are eight more songs, which are imploring, banao mujhko, banao! The batter is ready, it just hasn’t been fried yet,” says Ram. As of now, the band has not decided when the new originals will be released. Prod Amit for a tentative date and he says, “Whenever the vaccine is made.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/8i85gz/article32963067.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Indian-Ocean-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/indian-ocean-bharat-ke-mahaveer-interview-upcoming-collaborations/article32963068.ece

“People here have been requesting rehabilitation in the area around Thevara, and are anxious about a rehabilitation project in Kakkanad, far from their sources of livelihood,” he said. “As per a High Court order, the river is to be restored to its original width of 48 m, which will displace about 129 families in the area. Rehabilitation in Kakkanad will not be feasible considering most residents work in the area around the Thevara market,” said Mr. Siju. In March, COVID-19-related restrictions had put an abrupt stop to the protest of the people in the area against eviction without proper rehabilitation.

While inaugurating the Champakkara bridge, the Chief Minister had said that the Konthuruthy river would also be restored by KMRL, in addition to the other five canals that were initially part of their project, said MLA T. J. Vinod. At a meeting held last week with the Sub Collector, local councillors, the tahsildar, the Mayor, Survey Department officials and Ernakulam MP, it was suggested that rehabilitation should be sought nearby, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/no-clarity-yet-on-rehabilitation-of-konthuruthy-residents/article32964718.ece
293,2020/10/28,Police await permission to conduct polygraph test on murder suspects,"Case relates to finding of a decomposed body in Perumbavoor plywood firm in May

More than five months after a highly decomposed body was found in the chimney of a plywood company at Pattimattom near Perumbavoor, the Ernakulam Rural police have zeroed in on two suspects.

The body was found on May 23 when workers mounted the chimney to clean it, prior to reopening the firm after the lockdown. As soon as they opened the chimney, a hand protruded out, startling the workers, who informed the supervisor, who, in turn, alerted the Kunnathunadu police.

Going by the state of decomposition, the police suspected that the body had been up there for more than a month. Since then, the police have reached the conclusion that the victim was probably a 22-year-old man from Assam who was employed at the plywood company. Two of his colleagues have been identified as suspects.

“We are awaiting court permission for conducting a polygraph test on the suspects. We had also summoned the victim’s brother from Assam and collected his DNA samples to confirm the identity conclusively,” said Inspector V.T. Shajan.

The police have since changed the case from unnatural death to murder, considering circumstantial evidences. About 80 migrant workers of the firm were stopped from returning home, and the suspects were identified based on the contradictions in their statements.

The victim had joined the firm only three months before his death. The body was cremated after collecting samples, which were sent to the forensic lab in Thiruvananthapuram for DNA profiling.

The police had been groping in the dark for prolonged periods with no conclusive leads in the case. There was no CCTV at the plywood company and no man missing complaints matching the profile of the victim were reported from the rural police limits before or after the body was found.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/police-await-permission-to-conduct-polygraph-test-on-murder-suspects/article32964410.ece

The arrested was identified as Amal, 25, of Vengoor. He was arrested on a report by District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik.

The arrested was accused in cases related to murder, attempt to murder, assault, trespass, unlawful assembly, and illegal possession of arms in Kuruppampady, Kothamangalam and Angamaly police stations.

He was kept in preventive arrest for six months in 2017 on account of his proclivity to engage in criminal acts. The police have now invoked KAAPA against the accused who is already behind the bars for having attacked the police and obstructing their duty while arresting one of his accomplices. His arrest was recorded by Kuruppampady Station House Officer K.R. Manoj.

This was the fifth arrest to be made this month under Operation Dark Hunt aimed at cleansing the Ernakulam Rural limits of miscreants.

298,2020/10/28,‘Digital form of business helps bring down corruption’,"Insurance sector urged to encourage more people to use it

With the advent of more and more public institutions offering digital form of transactions, allegations such as corruption were declining, said Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry president N. Jagatheesan here on Wednesday.

Speaking at the Vigilance Awareness Week programme organised by the United India Insurance Company Limited at its divisional office, he stressed the need for creating awareness of digital form of transactions. For reservation of tickets in train, bus and air, hotel accommodation, payment of taxes and remittance of premiums to insurance companies the digital form was swift, and it also played a pivotal role in minimising corruption.

He urged the insurance industry to encourage more people to use the digital form as it saved time and facilitated in saving documents for future claims, Mr. Jagatheesan said. The COVID-19 pandemic had, in a way, encouraged more people to adapt to the online mode through their work from home (WFH) culture.

J. Selvam, secretary of the Chamber, said the digital form of doing business helped various stakeholders in the transport industry to a phenomenal extent. The usefulness of VAHAN used in road transport sector had, in fact, given a new meaning to the digital form as the users could check the details through the App and avoid visiting the RTO.

Earlier, United India Insurance senior divisional manager P. Rajendran, in his welcome address, said regular campaigns about evils of corruption and the role of vigilance officers had benefited the consumers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/l2cvvw/article32968728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Insurance,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/digital-form-of-business-helps-bring-down-corruption-madurai-chamber/article32966813.ece
299,2020/10/28,PIL plea wants inclusion of OBC category in census details,"HC issues notice to Centre on petition filed by AIOCC

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday ordered notice to the Centre on a public interest litigation petition that sought a direction to the government to include Other Backward Class (OBC) category in the House Listing Operation (HLO) and Population Enumeration (PE) before commencement of Census 2021.

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and B. Pugalendhi ordered notice to the Centre on the PIL petition filed by R. Thavamanidevi from Madurai, coordinator of All India OBC Coordination Committee (AIOCC), who sought a direction to the government to consider the representation sent by the committee to include the OBC category.

The petitioner said that after independence, the Census Act 1948 was passed and the census was carried out in two phases – House Listing Operation and Population Enumeration, using separate schedules for collection of information. The Central government decided to delete caste particulars from both the HLO and the PE, except for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

Recommendations were made by various commissions, including Kaka Kalelkar Commission and Mandal Commission, to conduct caste census, but the authorities did not take into account the recommendations. Despite the constitutional mandate to provide adequate representation to the backward class, no efforts had been made to conduct OBC census.

The Registrar General and Census Commissioner had notified under the Census Act that the HLO of Census 2021 would take place from April 1 to September 30, 2020, and the Census Officers were instructed to collect information on 31 questions. However, due to COVID-19, the census operation was postponed sine die before the commencement.

She pointed out that while seeking information about the head of the household in question number 10, only SC/ST/others had been elicited and OBC had been omitted. The representation made by the AIOCC to include the OBC category before the commencement of the Census 2021 should be considered, she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rk76xh/article32872654.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16OCTTH--MADURAIBENCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/pil-plea-wants-inclusion-of-obc-category-in-census-details-madurai/article32965878.ece

305,2020/10/28,A bathroom is built here with plastic bottles,"It has been created at Perumalpuram micro compost centre in Thoothukudi district

The Thoothukudi Corporation has used discarded plastic drinking water and soft drink bottles for constructing a bathroom as part of its solid waste management programme.

The discarded one litre-bottles have been used like bricks for constructing bathrooms after filling the bottles with beach sand.

Though the plastic bottles are collected separately from residents as non-degradable waste, collection of these plastic vessels from public places is still a challenge for the corporation’s workforce. The plastic bottles discarded in drainage channels often clog the underground channels to cause overflow of sewage through manholes which is another challenge being faced by the urban civic body.

When COVID-19 pandemic was in its peak in the district, those who came to the district from other districts or States were isolated in ‘quarantine camps’, where food and drinking water were served. Since the water was served in bottles, empty plastic bottles were collected and used for creating bathrooms.

The bottles have been closed tightly using adhesives so that they would get desired strength and ready to be used like bricks.

“We’ve used discarded plastic bottles in a novel fashion for useful purpose and a bathroom has been created at Perumalpuram micro compost centre.

The bathroom is useful to workers deployed there as they can leave this premises after taking bath in this bathroom,” said V.P.

307,2020/10/28,NHAI begins road laying work on New Natham Road in Madurai,"Work on the city’s first elevated highway resumes

The long wait seems to have come to an end for motorists using New Natham Road as National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has begun re-laying the road that had been dug up to construct the city’s first elevated highway.

After carrying out groundwork for the last two weeks, the work of laying of dense bituminous macadam (DBM), the course layer, has begun on those stretches of road between IOC junction at Tallakulam to Oomachikulam where the launching of concrete girders have been completed.

The girders have been launched in 78 out of 188 spans under the project to construct elevated highway for 7.3-km. “We have completed girder launching in around 45% of the total stretch and have planned to lay the road for around 3.2 km in the first phase,” a senior official from NHAI said.

NHAI had originally planned to lay the road to make it smooth and motorable on the stretch between IOC junction and near Athikulam junction to facilitate procession of Lord Kallalazhagar during Chithirai festival in summer of 2020. However, COVID-19 brought the work to a standstill and normal celebrations of Chithirai festival were also cancelled.

The dug up road and the loose top soil were putting road users to lot of inconvenience though the stretch of road between IOC junction and Bharathi Ula Road has remained closed ever since the work began in November 2019. “We have planned to complete the road laying work along with the pedestrian pathway with railings by December,” the official added.

While the project was originally planned to be completed by November 2020, following the disruption due to lockdown, the officials have now planned to complete good portion of the project by May 2021.

The final layer of road would be laid later. The elevated corridor is part of four-laning of Madurai-Natham highway to provide a shorter four-laned road route to Tiruchi.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/pdhpsx/article32969029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA29MDUNEWNATHAMROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/nhai-begins-road-laying-work-on-new-natham-road-in-madurai/article32961637.ece

The Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, Karnataka, has opposed the release of Hindi film, Laxmmi Bomb, on the OTT platform on the ground that it hurts the sentiments of Hindus.

Talking to reporters, State spokesperson of the mahasabha Jagan Kumar said that this film was in continuation of the trend of films defaming Hindus that are being screened on the digital platform. “We cannot allow screening of films that hurt our sentiments,” Mr. Kumar said. The film, which is a remake of Tamil film, Muni 2: Kanchana, is set for release on Disney Hotsar on November 9. Secretary of the mahasabha Dharmendra said that the film showed the lead actor with big kumkum on his forehead, dancing while holding a Trishul. This, he said, was showing Goddess Lakshmi in poor light. People from the third gender were also being defamed.

As the film will promote superstition, the State government should invoke the provisions of the Karnataka Prevention and Eradication of Inhuman Evil Practices and Black Magic Act 2017 and stop the screening. The mahasabha was considering legal options to get the screening of the film stopped, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/hindu-mahasabha-opposes-release-of-hindi-film/article32958748.ece

313,2020/10/28,DRL net slides 30% even as sales rise,"‘Sputnik-V trials may end by March’

Pharma major Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories has reported a 30.3% decline in consolidated net profit to ₹771.8 crore for quarter ended September compared with ₹1,106.8 crore a year earlier when it received a boost from recognition of deferred tax assets.

A close to 20% rise in net sales to ₹4,776.6 crore (₹3,998.2 crore) — which CFO Saumen Chakraborty said was highest ever in a single quarter — thus proved insufficient.

Like the MAT credit recognition for net profit, a one off licencing fee gain a year earlier meant total revenue from operations grew a subdued 2% to ₹4,962.1 crore (₹4,866.8 crore), according to the results prepared as per Ind AS norms

In a statement, co-chairman and MD G.V. Prasad said, “We are pleased to report continued growth across all the markets and improved productivity”.

Mr. Chakraborty, who briefed the media virtually alongwith CEO Erez Israeli, said the decline in net profit was expected as last year there “were huge out licensing income, [of] more than ₹700 crore and we [also] had MAT credit recognition.”

Vaccine trials

On the timeline of clinical trials for Russia’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine candidate, for which Dr. Reddy’s had got approval recently from India’s health regulator, Mr. Israeli said while Phase II will begin with about 100 participants soon and get over by December, Phase III trials, with 1,500 participants, could be completed as early as March. Depending on compilation of data from Phase-II and regulatory approvals, it could even stretch into April or May, he added.

Dr. Reddy’s and Russian sovereign wealth fund RDIF had recently announced a partnership to conduct clinical trials for Sputnik V and its distribution in India. On whether Dr. Reddy’s will manufacture the vaccine, he said “it will be produced in India by someone else.”

Ransomware attack

On the cyberattack on the company last week, Mr. Chakraborty said it was ransomware attack.

“We experienced an information security incident and consequently isolated the impacted IT services. This incident involved a ransomware attack,” he said. The company engaged outside cybersecurity experts, launched a comprehensive containment and remediation effort and investigation to address the incident.

“We are still investigating in terms of where it has originated from,” he said, parrying questions on whether any ransom was paid.

A release said “as of date, our investigation has not ascertained if any data breaches in the incident pertain to personally identifiable information stored in the company's systems. Recovery and restoration of all applications and data is underway.

314,2020/10/28,"Bharti won’t bid at 5G auction, reserve price too high: Vittal","‘Will examine need for 1,800 Mhz as usage is coming down’

Bharti Airtel on Wednesday indicated that it would refrain from bidding for 5G spectrum at the auctions, which were likely to be held early next year, given the current reserve prices.

The company may look at radio frequencies below 1,000 megahertz (Mhz) to improve network availability inside buildings and in rural areas, Gopal Vittal, MD and CEO, India & South Asia, said in a post-earnings call.

“We are hearing from the department that there may be an auction early next year… any time between January and March,” Mr. Vittal said. “Given that the reserve price of 5G is as high as it is, we will not buy it because we won’t be able to afford it. I can’t comment on what others will do, but from our perspective, it will not make sense,” he added.

Bharti would also consider whether it needs to bid for spectrum in the 1,800 Mhz band as the amount of spectrum being used for 2G was decreasing every quarter.

Asked if there were any plans to introduce affordable low-cost smartphones, similar to what Jio was working on, Mr. Vittal said Bharti was studying the space.

On tariffs, Mr. Vittal reiterated that there was a need to raise prices. “We have signaled that we want tariffs to go up. We’re at a premium already, and we’ll be happy to follow the same day if tariffs sort of go up.”

The current tariff levels were not sustainable in the long term for the industry, Mr. Vittal added.

317,2020/10/28,Industry campaign to give sugar an image makeover,"Lot of myths going around about danger of its consumption without scientific basis: Food Secretary.

Messages downplaying the health impact of sugar could soon start making their way into your social media feeds as the sugar industry has launched a mass awareness campaign “to counter the myths and misconceptions” swirling around their product.

Launching the Indian Sugar Mills Association’s new consumer website meetha.org on Wednesday, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey noted that domestic sugar consumption has remained stagnant over the last few years at 19 kg, lower than the global average of 23.5 kg. With production continuing to grow, stagnant consumption has led to a glut in surplus stock, resulting in sugar mills unable to pay cane farmers their full dues.

“There are a lot of myths going around about the danger of sugar consumption without scientific basis. This misinformation multiplies faster than the truth. It is important to present scientific information so that people can make informed decisions,” said Mr. Pandey, suggesting that the industry explore new products like packaged sugarcane juice.

At a policy level, the industry lobby has already been successful in pressuring the Food Safety and Standards Authority to drop its proposal for “traffic light labelling” to warn consumers about foods with high sugar, salt and fat content.

“The FSSAI wanted to use red labelling when more than 10% of calories in a food item came from sugar. We urged them to print nutrition data rather than use this kind of traffic light labelling. We believe the FSSAI has given up that project,” said ISMA director general Abinash Verma.

FSSAI spokesperson Ruchika Sharma confirmed that the agency was no longer considering the colour coded system. “We had a lot of negative feedback from the industry. So now we are considering using symbols or icons instead of the traffic light system. The new labelling system is likely to be rolled out next year,” she told The Hindu.

Apart from the new website, the campaign has already targeted Facebook and Linkedin, and will soon spread to WhatsApp as well, said Mr. Verma. “There is absolutely no scientific evidence or any research paper which establishes that consumption of sugar in itself leads to any particular disease, even like diabetes or dental cavities,” he said. “Did you know that one teaspoon of sugar contains just 15 calories? Of course, like any food item, sugar must be eaten in moderation.”

The campaign has roped in a panel of doctors and chefs to give sugar an image makeover, highlighting its importance in traditional cuisine, playing up the dangers of artificial sweeteners, emphasising the purity of refined sugar and blaming a lack of exercise as the main cause for obesity rather than sugar.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/7q1awd/article32965135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-sugar-diabetes,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/industry-campaign-to-give-sugar-an-image-makeover/article32965065.ece

320,2020/10/28,TikTok leans into e-commerce with Shopify deal,"Canadian e-commerce platform Shopify said on Tuesday it’s made a deal with TikTok enabling merchants to create shoppable video ads that drive customers to online stores

The popular short-form video app TikTok, still under US government scrutiny for its Chinese ownership, is moving closer to becoming a marketplace for buying stuff.

Canadian e-commerce platform Shopify said on Tuesday it’s made a deal with TikTok enabling merchants to create shoppable video ads that drive customers to online stores.

Also read | U.S. insists on need to ban TikTok

The partnership was announced Tuesday amid stalled negotiations for Walmart to buy a 7.5% stake in the video app. Walmart’s planned investment is part of a government-forced deal that would rescue TikTok from a threatened ban by President Donald Trump and advance Walmart’s ambitions for the world of social commerce.

If you’re watching a TikTok video and somebody’s got a piece of apparel or an item on it that you really like, what if you could just quickly purchase that item? Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told CNBC earlier this month. That’s what we’re seeing happen in countries around the world. And it’s intriguing to us, and we would like to be part of it.

ByteDance, the Beijing-based company that owns TikTok, already runs a thriving social media marketplace on Douyin, its twin video app for the Chinese market. Buying products through social media websites isn’t yet as common in the US, though Pinterest and Facebook-owned Instagram have made some inroads and TikTok last year began making it easier for businesses to link to themselves from the app.

Shopify said its merchants will be able to select which product they would like to promote. Then, video ads will be automatically generated that could show up in a TikTok user’s video feed and drive customers to Shopify for checkout.

TikTok said in a prepared statement on Tuesday that Ottawa-based Shopify will be a perfect partner to help us grow and expand our commerce capabilities globally.

It’s not clear what the partnership means for TikTok’s negotiations with Walmart. Walmart and Shopify are on good terms, having teamed up against Amazon in June on a deal that enables Shopify’s small businesses to get listed on Walmart.com.

Trump said over the summer he would shut down TikTok unless ByteDance sold its US assets to an American company, citing concerns about the potential for the Chinese government to spy on users’ data.

ByteDance in September proposed to US authorities a partnership with Walmart, California tech company Oracle and other American investors designed to relieve national security concerns about the app. Trump expressed support for the idea but officials haven’t formally approved it.

Trump’s attempt to ban TikTok was also delayed until after next week’s US presidential election after the company sued in federal court to halt the order.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/k6v20d/article32009710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THCACHETIKTOK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/tiktok-leans-into-e-commerce-with-shopify-deal/article32961065.ece
321,2020/10/28,Flipkart-Aditya Birla Fashion proposed deal violates FDI policy: CAIT,"CAIT said the present FDI policy clearly prohibits a foreign company to venture in any form of multi-brand retail trading including through e-commerce by having any equity interests in the sellers.

Traders’ body CAIT on October 27 raised objections over Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail’s plans to raise ₹1,500 crore by issuing 7.8% stake to Walmart-owned Flipkart Group, alleging that the proposed deal violates the government’s FDI policy.

The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) wrote to Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal in this regard urging him to prohibit Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd. (ABFRL) from directly or indirectly selling its inventory on the marketplace platforms owned/controlled by the Flipkart Group.

It also requested the Minister “to not allow the proposed FDI unless they undertake that ABFRL will not be selling its inventory through any of the marketplace platforms owned/controlled by Walmart-owned Flipkart Group”.

ABFRL did not immediately offer any comment.

Last week, ABFRL said its board approved the proposed stake sale. ABFRL said it plans to use this capital to strengthen its balance sheet and accelerate its growth trajectory.

The company said it has also entered into a commercial agreement in relation to the sale and distribution of its various brands. The transaction is subject to regulatory and other customary approvals.

“In its filing to the stock exchange, a clear intent to make ABFRL a preferred seller on the marketplaces owned and operated by Flipkart Group is shown which strictly violates the policy of the government,” CAIT said in the letter to Goyal.

The traders’ body stated that the present FDI policy clearly prohibits a foreign company to venture in any form of multi-brand retail trading (MBRT) including through e-commerce by having any equity interests in the sellers on the market-platform, or directly/indirectly controlling their inventory through side agreements, or under the garb of B2B e-commerce.

It said the “restrictive provisions in FDI policy, through press note 2 of 2018, were made to protect the small traders/kirana shopkeepers and Indian industry from the onslaught of capital duping by foreign multinational companies and any violation of such provision must be strictly dealt with”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lpt8ep/article32960893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th06-BIZ-CAIT-WG923UENVH3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/flipkart-aditya-birla-fashion-proposed-deal-violates-fdi-policy-cait/article32960879.ece

SEBI chairman Ajay Tyagi, along with other officials of the capital markets regulator, had an e-interaction on Tuesday with various stakeholders including industry and investor associations from the U.S. The interaction was organised by the U.S. India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF).

“We interacted with various stakeholders including the investors in the Indian capital markets from the USA. We briefed them about the key developments of the Indian economy as well as the recent trends in the securities market, especially in this COVID-19 era,” Mr. Tyagi said in a statement.

He further said the achievements of Indian primary markets, secondary markets and specific products such as REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) and InvITs (Infrastructure investment trusts) were highlighted in the interaction.

The participants appreciated various initiatives taken by SEBI, especially with respect to direct listing proposal and creation of new products such as REITs and InvITs which have the potential to attract more foreign investment while benefiting domestic economy given its multiplier effect.

“The participants emphasised the need for early finalisation of direct listing proposal; development of the corporate bond market; reforms in the IPO regulations; digitisation of processes; and showed interest in participating in innovative ideas under SEBI’s regulatory sandbox framework,” the regulator said.

In addition, attractiveness of the Indian markets despite the COVID-19 impact and the recent surge in foreign investment into India through the FPI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) route was also emphasised in the interaction.

Considering that the largest number of FPIs and about one-third of the total assets under custody of FPIs are from the U.S., SEBI said the importance of U.S. investments into India was emphasised especially taking into account the growing partnership between the two countries.

The increasing number of registrations of FPIs every year and rising inflows of FPI investment in the Indian equity market signify the sustained interest of foreign investors in the Indian capital markets.

The initiatives taken by SEBI towards ease of participation by FPIs such as simplified registration process, common application form, onboarding during COVID-19 through digital scanning of KYC documents, were also appreciated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/ozpho0/article30169560.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05BUAJAYTYAGI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/reforms-in-ipo-rules-development-of-corporoate-bond-market-discussed-with-us-investors-sebi/article32963561.ece

M&M, Maruti, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, NTPC, Axis Bank and Infosys were also among the gainers.

On the other hand, Kotak Bank fell around 2%, followed by HDFC, HUL, ICICI Bank and Titan.

In the previous session, Sensex surged 376.60 points or 0.94% to finish at 40,522.10, while Nifty climbed 121.65 points or 1.03% to 11,889.40.

Exchange data showed that foreign institutional investors purchased equities worth ₹3,514.89 crore on a net basis on October 27.

According to Arjun Yash Mahajan Head Institutional Business at Reliance Securities, Indian equities are expected to be volatile ahead of monthly derivatives expiry and U.S. presidential election.

However, news pertaining to a fiscal stimulus before Diwali, MSCI rebalancing next month and healthy 2Q corporate earnings are likely to aid the domestic market, he said.

Hey there, and welcome back to Clued In!

You don’t have to worry that you don’t know how to make head or tail of a cryptic clue. We have to start somewhere (broadly speaking, this blog is a good place to start). In terms of the clue, a good place to start looking for the answer is at either end of the clue. Look at the word or words in the beginning of the clue and then those at the end. Swirl them around in your mind.

Look at the word length of the answer, and think of which word could possibly have a syonym that is a good fit.

The Hindu Cryptic #13,078 | Arden | 13 Across CLUE: Bird lime — I’m going for ownership (5) Clue types : deletion Definition : ownership Answer : TITLE Clue explained: Here, we need a 5-letter word. Let’s assume that ‘ownership’ is the definition. Another word for a small ‘bird’ is TIT. Then, we see ‘lime I’m going’ (the punctuation mark is ignored on purpose, because it rarely matters in cryptic crosswords). This just means that we remove (as indicated by ‘going’) the letters ‘i’ and ‘m’ from ‘lime’, to get L and E. Now, add the L and E to TIT, and get TITLE, our 5-letter word that means ‘ownership’.

Was that fun to solve? Did you get a kick out of understanding how to work out the answer to a cryptic crossword clue? Did you enjoy being given a random sentence that ultimately leads to a completely unexpected but totally decipherable answer?

The definition is ‘time of the week’. ‘I would’ is to be taken as a unit, and converted into its commonly abbreviated form I’D (never mind the apostrophe, or any sort of punctuation mark, in cryptic crosswords). Another word for ‘race’ is FRAY. So, if ID ‘enters’ FRAY, we have to insert the former into the latter, to get FRIDAY, which is a ‘time of the week’, so to speak!

330,2020/10/28,It is judgment time for Donald Trump,"If poetic justice is of any consequence, the U.S. should get a new leader

In the U.S., opinion polls can be grossly misleading, the electoral system throws up leaders who do not have popular support, unreadable ballot papers may lead to unexpected results, and absentee and advanced balloting may open a Pandora’s box. An intense battle in the Supreme Court may well bring out a result which goes against the majority public opinion. Like it happened in 2016, psephologists, journalists, strategists, thinkers and astrologers may fail to predict the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. But if poetic justice is of any consequence, the U.S. should get a new leader.

Volumes have been written on the good and the bad about the incumbent President. Donald Trump’s claim for a Nobel Prize is not as far-fetched as it appears. His campaign will make a case by arguing: Who made the effort to tame the “rocket man” of North Korea? Who sought cooperation and friendship with China and Russia? Who volunteered to mediate India’s problems with Pakistan and China? Who downgraded NATO, a relic of the Cold War? Who brought about changes in West Asia, including normalisation of Israel’s relations with the UAE and Bahrain? Who ended the American war in Afghanistan? And who has refrained from despatching American troops to different corners of the globe?

The Hindu Explains | How does America elect its President, and why is winning the popular vote not enough?

The question is a moral one

Within the U.S., many identified with slogans such as ‘Make America Great Again’ and ‘America First’. Mr. Trump’s conservative political, social and cultural policies and protectionist trade politics have a huge following. As a result, many may vote for him. But the question is a moral one. Is the U.S. today more prosperous, secure and liberal than in 2016? Has the U.S. increased its allies around the world? Does it inspire confidence among its friends? Does the U.S. government provide security, well-being, justice, inclusiveness, diversity, transparency and personal freedom to all its people? Has its handling of the pandemic saved more lives and livelihoods? Were the people given the right advice on health and prevention of infections? Did the President show by example how a responsible citizen should behave during the triple crisis facing the U.S. — the pandemic, the economic meltdown and racial strife?

Weakening institutions

In the international arena, the Trump administration’s biggest disservice was the undermining of the post-war architecture of peace, which was built brick by brick by the U.S. and its allies. The UN, which is at the centre of multilateralism, has been weakened to the extent of being paralysed. When China used its status as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to block even a meeting of the Council to consider a multilateral effort to fight the pandemic, the U.S. threw the baby out with the bathwater when it withdrew support from the World Health Organization (WHO). This left China as the champion of the WHO. The U.S., with its economic and scientific prowess, should have led an international effort in fighting the pandemic. Multilateralism reached its lowest ebb when the UN failed to tackle the biggest challenge to international peace and security. This would not have happened if Mr. Trump had not called the UN a “club” and made absolute sovereignty the fulcrum of his foreign policy.

International treaties constitute another pillar of the international framework. Nations voluntarily sign these treaties after careful consideration and open debate. These treaties are ratified by the respective legislatures, where necessary. Occasions do arise for member nations to leave the treaties in their supreme national interest. But Mr. Trump walked out of treaties, agreements and arrangements on the environment, nuclear non-proliferation, arms limitation and trade with the abandon of someone leaving a distasteful stage show.

Also read | Trump, Biden discuss contrasting realities and plans in final debate

Unpredictability and inconsistency are the stuff that bad foreign policy is made of. As David Nakamura wrote, Mr. Trump’s promise that “he could tame China’s rise through a mix of personal charisma and deal making prowess has faltered… giving way to the most hostile period of bilateral relations in decades.” Mr. Trump bewildered friends and foes alike, not to speak of his own advisers, by his foreign policy pronouncements and announcements on Twitter. Some of his advisers, whom he himself had chosen, marched out of the White House one after the other, while some others stayed on, pledging to safeguard the interests of the nation anonymously by violating the spirit, but not the word of the law.

The handling of COVID-19 was the unkindest cut of all. Mr. Trump genuinely believes that COVID-19 is like the common flu, which would take its course with a few deaths here and there. He has defied science and ignored the experience of many countries. It is incredible that he sent out confused signals to the people, some of whom still seem to believe him more than they believe the health officials as his methods are oversimplified, though often contradictory and self-destructive. He could have saved many of the more than 2,25,000 lives, and thousands of livelihoods, lost in the bargain. Optimism and self-confidence are virtues for leaders, but not for the kind of leaders who fiddled as the nation burned.

Data | Biden significantly ahead in opinion polls

On India, calculated moves

Indian Americans are of marginal significance in this election, but they have occupied centre stage because of the impression that Mr. Trump has been good to India and that many Indian Americans have moved from their traditional Democratic moorings to vote for him. Mr. Trump was no more friendly to India than his predecessors, except when he calculated that he could derive economic or political benefits for the U.S. and himself. It was an opportunistic posture, liable to be abandoned in the next tweet. He had no problem threatening his “good friend” Prime Minister Narendra Modi on matters of trade, immigration, or even on the issue of India supplying medication. ‘Howdy Modi’ and ‘Namaste Trump’ were sheer exhibitionism. On Pakistan and China, he preferred to mediate rather than support India. India has nothing to fear in a change of leadership as India-U.S. relations enjoy bipartisan support. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, whatever their past record, would see the logic of friendship and cooperation with the world’s largest democracy. George Bush and Barack Obama were not great friends of India till they became Presidents. Indian Americans will vote in their own best interests; surveys indicate that many will remain loyal to the Democratic Party.

The disastrous first presidential debate, which marked a new low in democratic traditions; Mr. Trump testing positive for COVID-19, his brief hospitalisation and his immediate recovery; his statements relating to white supremacy; his ambivalent position about peaceful transfer of power; and his resumption of the campaign have confused the world. None of it seems to have changed the situation on the ground. In the meantime, the White House has become a “super spreader” of COVID-19.

The election process has started, with more than 65 million voters having cast their votes. When the final results are known, we will know whether poetic justice played a role in the U.S. presidential election.

331,2020/10/28,The Gilgit-Baltistan game plan,"If Islamabad integrates the region into Pakistan, that would serve its own interests as well as China’s

Reports indicate that the Pakistan government is on the verge of declaring Gilgit-Baltistan a province of Pakistan. The most authoritative declaration came last month from Pakistan’s Minister of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan who stated that Prime Minister Imran Khan would soon make an announcement to this effect.

Technically speaking Gilgit-Baltistan was a part of the State of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) at the time of Partition although Dogra rule sat very lightly on this region. Much of it, particularly Gilgit, because of its strategic importance in the context of the Great Game in Central Asia, had been leased to the British by the Maharaja and was under the direct control of the British government until the lapse of suzerainty. Gilgit had its own British-officered local army, the Gilgit Scouts, which switched allegiance to Pakistan within a week of the Maharaja’s accession to India.

Gilgit-Baltistan | The land of peaks, streams and disputes

From the beginning Gilgit-Baltistan was governed as a separate entity by Pakistan and not as a part of Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK). Islamabad had hesitated to declare it a province of Pakistan because of its claim that J&K is disputed territory and its future must be decided by a plebiscite among all its inhabitants.

Why change status now?

There are several reasons why Islamabad has now decided to formally integrate Gilgit-Baltistan into Pakistan. First, the revocation of Article 370 by India and the bifurcation of the State into two Union Territories have sent a clear message that the Kashmir dispute is not only dead but also buried as far as New Delhi is concerned. Pakistan’s imminent move, transforming Gilgit-Baltistan’s de facto status into a de jure one, is a clear riposte to the Indian decision.

Second, public opinion in Gilgit-Baltistan has long been in favour of full integration into Pakistan as a province as the predominantly Shia and ethnically distinct population of the region has very little in common with PoK. Islamabad feels that by declaring it a province will assuage domestic dissatisfaction on this score.

Third, China has been encouraging Islamabad to turn Gilgit-Baltistan into a province. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) runs through Gilgit-Baltistan and China has invested heavily in the region. In view of India’s continuing claim to the area, Beijing is interested in delinking Gilgit-Baltistan formally from Kashmir so that its investment does not remain hostage to the possibility of another round of India-Pakistan hostilities over Kashmir.

China also wants to repay India in its own coin following New Delhi’s decision to separate Ladakh from J&K. Beijing views the Indian move as the first step towards India attempting to enforce its claim on Aksai Chin, currently under Chinese occupation.

In addition to CPEC, China considers Gilgit-Baltistan very important because of its strategic location. It is contiguous to Ladakh as well as Xinjiang and could act as a staging post against India if a major conflict erupts in Ladakh. Beijing possibly presumes that Pakistan will agree to a Chinese military presence in Gilgit-Baltistan because Islamabad would like to see India embroiled simultaneously in a two-front war — in Ladakh and Gilgit — with China.

There is already substantial Chinese civilian presence in Gilgit-Baltistan related to CPEC projects. China is interested in stationing military personnel as well. Delinking the region from the Kashmir dispute would make it easier for the international community to accept Chinese presence in Gilgit-Baltistan. It would also serve Pakistan’s purpose of getting back at India for abrogating Article 370 as well as complicating India’s strategic environment by the implicit threat of turning it into a Chinese staging ground.

India must calibrate its response carefully because merely by turning up the rhetorical heat, it may play into Chinese and Pakistani hands and escalate the situation. Rhetoric must always be determined by a meticulous assessment of capability.

332,2020/10/28,India’s outreach to Myanmar,"The recent announcement of initiatives establishes India’s presence in sectors where it ought to be more pronounced

The recent visit of Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Chief of the Army Staff Gen. Manoj Naravane to Myanmar reflected India’s multidimensional interests in the country and the deepening of ties between Delhi and Naypyidaw. Coming a few weeks before Myanmar’s general election, the visit underscored two lines of thinking that drive India’s Myanmar policy: engagement with key political actors and balancing neighbours. For Myanmar, the visit would be viewed as India’s support for its efforts in strengthening democratisation amidst criticisms by rights groups over the credibility of its upcoming election. The Indian delegation met State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and Myanmar’s military Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.

Non-interference in internal politics

The political logic that has shaped India’s Myanmar policy since the 1990s has been to support democratisation driven from within the country. This has allowed Delhi to engage with the military that played a key role in Myanmar’s political transition and is still an important political actor. It has also enabled Delhi to work with the party in power, whether the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party that won the 2010 polls or the pro-democracy National League for Democracy, which is in power now.

Also read | India has an ‘abiding interest’ in resolving crisis in Rakhine State

India is cognisant of the geopolitical dimension of Myanmar’s democratisation. Myanmar’s political transition created challenges for Naypyidaw and limited its ties with the West. India and a few Asian countries have engaged Myanmar keeping in mind the need to reintegrate it with the region and world. This has been a strategic imperative for Naypyidaw as part of its policy of diversifying its foreign engagements.

A key factor behind the military regime’s decision to open the country when it initiated reforms was, in part, to reduce dependence on China. By engaging Myanmar, Delhi provides alternative options to Naypyidaw. This driver in India’s Myanmar policy has perhaps gained greater salience in the rapidly changing regional geopolitics.

Recent initiatives

Like in other neighbouring countries, India suffers from an image of being unable get its act together in making its presence felt on the ground. Some initiatives announced during the joint visit suggest Delhi is taking steps to leverage its political, diplomatic, and security ties with Myanmar to address some of these issues. The inauguration of the liaison office of the Embassy of India in Naypyidaw may seem a routine diplomatic activity. However, establishing a permanent presence in the capital where only a few countries have set up such offices does matter. Interestingly, China was the first country to establish a liaison office in Naypyidaw in 2017.

India has also proposed to build a petroleum refinery in Myanmar that would involve an investment of $6 billion. This is another indication of Myanmar’s growing significance in India’s strategic calculus, particularly in energy security. It also shows India’s evolving competitive dynamic with China in the sector at a time when tensions between the two have intensified.

Another area of cooperation that has expanded involves the border areas. The joint visit reiterated the “mutual commitment not to allow respective territories to be used for activities inimical to each other.” Both Delhi and Naypyidaw have been collaborating in the development of border areas with the understanding that it is the best guarantee to secure their borders. And this is an area where the fruits of bilateral cooperation are already evident on the ground. Furthermore, the recent announcement that India was transferring a Kilo-class submarine to Myanmar demonstrates the depth of their cooperation in the maritime domain.

Also read | India, Myanmar review ties

Last, for Delhi, the balancing act between Bangladesh and Myanmar remains one of the keys to its overall approach to the Rohingya issue. Delhi has reiterated its support for “ensuring safe, sustainable and speedy return of displaced persons” to Myanmar. The choices before Delhi are limited on the issue. By positioning as playing an active role in facilitating the return of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, India has made it clear that it supports Myanmar’s efforts and also understands Bangladesh’s burden. For Delhi, engaging rather than criticising is the most practical approach to finding a solution.

Delhi’s political engagement and diplomatic balancing seems to have worked so far in its ties with Myanmar. Whether it has leveraged these advantages on the ground to the full is open to debate. The aforementioned initiatives could be the beginning of change on the ground by establishing India’s presence in sectors where it ought to be more pronounced. For India, Myanmar is key in linking South Asia to Southeast Asia and the eastern periphery becomes the focal point for New Delhi’s regional outreach.

333,2020/10/28,Dead letter: On Chile referendum,"Chileans have given themselves a chance to chart out an inclusive Constitution

Last year, when Chile was shaken by mass protests, the conservative President, Sebastián Piñera, agreed to hold a referendum on rewriting the country’s Constitution, introduced during the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, in a bid for calm. On Sunday, 78% of Chileans voted in favour of replacing the charter, which the protesters say was the main hurdle in introducing social and economic reforms, with a new document. Since its transition to democracy in 1990, Chile has amended the Constitution — principally written by the Pinochet-aide, Jaime Guzmán, and approved in a fraudulent plebiscite in 1980 — to take away many of its anti-democratic features. But the document, which has enshrined the conservative free-market philosophies of the Milton Friedman school, stayed on. It allowed the private sector to thrive and helped the economy expand. But it also led to the concentration of wealth in a minuscule minority, triggering social tensions. Protests erupted last year over a small rise in metro fares but it soon snowballed into a public agitation demanding reforms — an abolition of the private pension fund system, implemented by Gen. Pinochet, an increase in investments in education and health care, and a strengthening of the rights of the indigenous communities. The protesters also demanded an overhaul of the Constitution as it was impossible to introduce far-reaching reforms with the current charter. With Sunday’s plebiscite results, they have won the first stage.

Replacing the Constitution is going to be a two-year process. Next year, Chileans will elect a 155-member Assembly to draft the new document, which will then be put to a plebiscite in 2022. Half the delegates will be women. Political factions are still debating whether seats in the Assembly should be reserved for the indigenous groups. It may not be a smooth process given that different political factions represent different ideas and interests. The new Constitution is also expected to be a heated political issue, with the general elections next year. But despite the political and procedural challenges, it offers a fresh opportunity for Chile to say goodbye to a dark era. Gen. Pinochet came to power in 1973 after a U.S.-backed coup against Chile’s elected President, Salvador Allende. In the 17 years he was in power, Pinochet, who died in 2006, unleashed a reign of terror, resulting in the executions of thousands and the detention and torture of many more. The biggest problem with the present Constitution has been its origins. Now, through a democratic process, Chileans can bury the document and introduce a legitimate charter, which is an imperative for any modern democracy. It also offers them an opportunity to right the systemic wrongs of the past and chart out a more inclusive economic and social system that works not just for the government elites and the business classes but also for all Chileans.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dead-letter-the-hindu-editorial-on-chile-referendum/article32957592.ece
334,2020/10/28,Compound conundrum: On interest waiver,"While the waiver of the interest on interest is welcome, MSMEs need more help

The Centre’s scheme to bear the difference between the compound interest and simple interest on retail and MSME loans availed by borrowers whose aggregate outstanding borrowings were less than ₹2 crore between March 1 and August 31, has come not a day too soon. In spelling out the norms for lenders to identify eligible beneficiaries and then ensure that the extra ‘interest on interest’ be refunded by November 5, the government has clearly been spurred by the Supreme Court’s admonition to expedite relief to small borrowers. With the top court having pointedly referenced the approaching festival of lights when it said “the common man’s Deepavali” was in the government’s hands, the Centre has ended up setting a really tight deadline of less than two weeks for banks and NBFCs to credit the differential amount to the borrowers’ accounts. The lenders have their task cut out to make sure that they pick out all the eligible loans — education, housing, consumer durables, automobiles, consumption, credit card borrowings, as well as credit provided to MSMEs — and that the borrowings had not turned into non-performing assets as on February 29. They will then have to refund the difference between the compound interest charged for the six-month period and the simple interest. In making all the specified borrowers eligible for the ‘ex-gratia’, the government has sought to ensure equity between those who may have availed of the repayment moratorium and others who had opted to continue to service their borrowings.

The move, however, has understandably evoked both relief and some disquiet. Retail borrowers, especially those who continued to meet their EMI commitments notwithstanding the disruptions caused by the pandemic and lockdowns, stand to marginally benefit from the government’s payment and will be a relieved lot. On the other hand, MSMEs may find the assistance far too small to make a material difference, given the scale of economic hardship they have had to endure — from demand destruction, to material and labour shortages and regulatory woes. Given that these businesses provide substantial direct and indirect employment and also generate valuable tax revenue, it would have made far greater economic sense for the government to have categorised them separately. The additional fiscal impact should be seen against the benefit that would accrue were even a reasonable number of these enterprises to remain viable and resume their contribution to the national economy. Also, the ₹2-crore limit for retail loans provides succour to not just ‘vulnerable’ borrowers but creates a moral hazard by benefiting the well-heeled too. All eyes will now be on the Court when it resumes hearing the matter next month.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/compound-conundrum-the-hindu-editorial-on-interest-waiver/article32957577.ece

336,2020/10/28,BDA to cancel allotment letters of flats if full amount is not paid by the end of the year,"This comes close on the heels of the BDA increasing the application and registration fees

The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) has decided to cancel the allotment letter of BDA flats of beneficiaries who do not pay the whole amount by December 31 this year.

“BDA has built 1,2, and 3 BHK flats in various parts of the city, and has already allotted them to the beneficiaries after receiving the advance amount. However, over a hundred beneficiaries are yet to pay the full amount even after issuing multiple notices. Hence, we have decided to cancel their allotment letters if they do not pay the remaining amount by the end of this year,” a senior BDA official said.

The official said the beneficiaries were expected to pay the amount in four instalments. The official added that interest amount was to be paid if the beneficiaries do not pay the whole amount on time.

“However, in a meeting held in August this year, it was decided not to impose the interest amount. Hence, only the prescribed final amount is to be paid now,” he said.

This comes close on the heels of the BDA increasing the application and registration fees of flat and site purchase, and penalties.

However, this decision of the BDA has not gone down well with the public as they argue that such flats were specifically meant to benefit the low and middle income groups, and cancelling the allotment letter amidst the pandemic would be grave injustice.

Suryakiran A.S. of Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout Open-Forum said that more time should be given as people were under deep financial stress due to the pandemic.

“Such flats are generally bought by low income group and middle income group. They will not be able to arrange funds now. With job loss and pay cuts, getting loans is also not an option,” he said. He said that as the RBI and the banks had introduced moratorium on home loans, BDA could provide a moratorium for the payment of fees.

B.M. Shivakumar, president, Jayaprakash Narayan Vichara Vedike and an RTI activist, said that the BDA had not given basic facilities, including water, sewage and proper road and transport connection, to various such flats, and even that could be the reason people might not have paid the full amount.

“Instead of troubling the common people, the BDA should first provide proper facilities. In many places, the projects are incomplete. Let them finish them first,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/on60ks/article32957710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGBDAP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bda-to-cancel-allotment-letters-of-flats-if-full-amount-is-not-paid-by-the-end-of-the-year/article32957711.ece
337,2020/10/28,BBMP Commissioner orders survey of structures used for advertising,"The High Court of Karnataka has time and again directed the civic body to remove all illegal hoardings, flexes and banners

Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad has issued an order to zonal joint commissioners and zonal engineers to conduct a survey of iron structures that are used for advertisements, including the ones that do not have advertisements on them.

The High Court of Karnataka has time and again directed the civic body to remove all such illegal hoardings, flexes and banners.

The Commissioner has directed the officials concerned to prepare a list of such commercial hoardings at sub-division and ward levels along with tax and penalties imposed and paid, and FIRs registered, and submit it as soon as possible.

Sources in the BBMP said that there were a few cases regarding some commercial hoardings that were in the court. A senior BBMP official said that most of the illegal commercial structures have been removed by the civic body, and it was a “continuous process”.

“However, even after removing those huge hoardings and advertisements, iron structures and skeleton structures have remained. Now a survey of such structures will be conducted, identified and action will be taken as per law,” the official said. He added that identifying such structures was a continuous process and it was being done with the assistance of the police.

“Section 138 (removal of unauthorised advertisements) of the KMC Act is used for removal of illegal advertisements after issuing show-cause notice to the persons or agencies concerned. Action can also be taken based on the Karnataka Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act, 1981, against illegal advertisements, flexes, banners, hoardings,” the official added.

The official said that removal of such large hoardings was also aimed at minimising distractions and to promote traffic safety and prohibit the use of materials harmful to the environment.

In November 2019, the Karnataka High Court had directed the State government to issue necessary instructions empowering city corporations to take action against illegal advertisements, flexes, hoardings. It had also directed the government to issue instructions to the police department to register FIRs under relevant sections based on complaints by officers of city corporations and municipalities.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/a3hk5c/article32957678.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGSTRUCTUREP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-commissioner-orders-survey-of-structures-used-for-advertising/article32957375.ece
338,2020/10/28,"At workplaces, de-densification hacks take centrestage","With technology and common sense, manufacturing companies are making it safe for their workers

At the Bengaluru plant of Continental Automotive India, shop-floor workers change into electrostatic discharge (ESD) clothing before commencing work. With a minimum of 500 workers turning up for every shift, ensuring social distancing in the ‘change room’ was going to take some doing. With technology, the challenge was tackled more easily than expected.

Developed in-house, a sensor-based monitoring system installed at the entrance of the ‘change room’ now allows only a pre-set number of people. If anyone overstays their welcome, it would squeal. The overstayer is reported via the RFID tag embedded in the ID. The Raspberry Pi based application interfaces with an RFID scanner using MQTT for communication over a wireless LAN network.

“Previously, we had more than 50 employees accessing this room at any point in time; it has now been scaled down to 12,” said Phanindra Karody, head of the Bengaluru plant of Continental Automotive India.

Space decisions

A Colliers’ India survey says most companies are now evaluating lowering workplace density by up to 20%. It also says that until the pandemic subsides, de-densification of workplaces will push companies to scout for more space.

A majority of them have adopted cost-effective solutions, such as staggered timings, reduced shifts or alternate duty-rosters.

Thirumal Govindraj, managing director, RMZ Corp, said, “From a corporate standpoint, companies have 15-20% of their workforce working remotely. By staggering work timings, de-densification is already being achieved. So companies will wait till the end of the year to take a call on infrastructure requirements.”

All the tech parks of RMZ have been upgraded or retrofitted with a whole host of features, including touchless elevators and doors. “Whatever we have implemented is good enough for the next three to four months. Technology is changing and infrastructure is also evolving. So we would wait to bring any more drastic changes,” said Mr. Govindraj.

Demarcated work spaces

At the R&D labs of Texas Instruments India, a simple innovation does the trick. Karthik Dhanabal, Global Development Labs - India Leader, Texas Instruments, says that to check the possibility of crowding, its lab has now been divided into four zones, with each supporting a specific function, and access to it by a card. Inside, one-person-only benches and testing spaces ensure social distancing among workers.

“Engineers may come into the lab only in case of critical manual testing, measurements or if debugs are required. Such visits are low in frequency and ensure there are only limited employees in the workspace at any point in time. Moreover, we encourage that all debugging and testing process be run over Webex to reduce contact,” says Mr. Dhanabal, adding that employees are invited to offer suggestions on how to make the shop floor safer still.

‘Shift’ in focus

Bengaluru-headquartered Duroflex Mattresses has over 1,200 employees working across its three factories. To prevent crowding on the shop floor, the company has introduced two shifts where there were none earlier.

“If there are six machines on a floor, four would run in one shift and the balance two in the other shift. In pre-COVID-19 days, we had 100 % of the workforce coming in at a time and all the machines would be running simultaneously,” said Mohanraj J., president and Business Unit Head, Duroflex.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/u1r2jc/article32956559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGTEXASP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/at-workplaces-de-densification-hacks-take-centrestage/article32956560.ece
339,2020/10/28,"Decentralised committees to enforce rules on masks, social distancing","The BBMP has provided handheld devices to police stations, marshals and health inspectors to levy fines

With an aim of putting in place more stringent measures to ensure people wear masks covering their mouth and nose, and maintain social distancing in public, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has formed four committees, at the ward, division, zonal levels, and BBMP head office level.

Ward level committees have been set up in all the 198 wards with the assistant engineer, senior health inspector, ward marshal and a police officer in the committee. The committee will go around in the wards and ensure that citizens are following the precautionary measures.

The divisional level committee, formed in all the 27 divisions, will comprise the executive engineer, medical health officer and a senior police officer. This committee will review the functioning and effective enforcement by the ward level committee every week.

The zonal level committee, formed in all the eight zones, that will consist of joint commissioner, chief engineer, health officer, zonal marshal supervisor and a senior police officer, will review the reports received by the divisional committee.

The BBMP head office committee, which has eight senior officials, will monitor enforcement in the entire city.

According to an order issued by the BBMP Commissioner: “It is observed that in spite of large IEC activities and appeal to citizens to wear masks and maintain social distancing in all public places, it is found that some citizens are blatantly violating the COVID-19 directives and, accordingly, a penalty of ₹250 is being imposed for every such wilful violation.”

The BBMP has provided handheld devices to all police stations, 220 marshals, and health inspectors to levy fines. A fine of ₹250 is being levied for not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing in public places.

1,61,204 violations

From June 9 till October 27, the BBMP has recorded 1,61,204 cases of not wearing a mask in public places. A total of ₹3,57,79,819 has been collected from mask related violations.

On the other hand, around 18,470 violations have been booked in relation to maintaining social distancing in public places with the fines amounting to ₹39,77,666.

340,2020/10/28,Raid on gambling leads policemen to their own colleagues in Bengaluru,"When the Puttenahalli police were conducting a raid on a hotel after being informed about gambling, little did they know that they would be arresting some of their own.

A birthday party involving nine men at a hotel in J.P. Nagar recently had surprise visitors when the Puttenahalli police, who raided the room based on a tip-off, caught them gambling, along with ₹54,540 in cash.

It was only later that they discovered that of the nine arrested, seven were their own colleagues, working in different police stations across the city. The incident has been taken up seriously by the higher-ups in the police force.

Inspector R.S. Choudhari, who carried out the raid, reported the matter to Harish Pande, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South), who directed him to register an FIR against the accused, charging them under various sections of the Karnataka Police Act.

Inquiries revealed that the accused policemen were attending the birthday party of one of their friends. On Tuesday, they decided to get together at a hotel in J.P. Nagar after duty and started gambling after the usual cutting of cake. However, the jurisdictional police got a tip-off that a group of people had taken up a room in the hotel for gambling.

Taking serious note of the issue, Mr. Pande has initiated an inquiry into the matter, based on which disciplinary action will be taken. “This incident amounts to indiscipline and dereliction of duty,” a senior police officer probing the incident said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/raid-on-gambling-leads-policemen-to-their-own-colleagues-in-bengaluru/article32958641.ece
341,2020/10/28,Chennai Traffic police test pop-up lane for cycles on Kamarajar Salai,"Cyclists want similar lanes for those who do the daily commute, especially on arterial roads

The Greater Chennai Traffic police has tested a temporary pop-up cycle lane on the arterial Kamarajar Salai on Wednesday morning. Cyclists have welcomed the move, but point out that they need similar measures for cyclists In other areas too.

The Hindu had published an article - Lockdown brings spotlight back on bicyles - on Wednesday that highlighted the need for more infrastructure for cyclists in the city. N. Kannan, Additional Commissioner of police, traffic, had assured that they would set up a temporary pop-up lane for cyclists on Kamarajar Salai. ""We tried it out from 6 am to 8 a.m on Wednesday. I also inspected the same. Cyclists were happy to use the lane,"" he said.

Siddharth Dhawan, a cyclist, commented that it was a pleasant experience. ""For the first time there was space for cyclists. But a few motorcycles kept coming into the lane,"" he said. However, many cyclists failed to notice it.

Divagaran T., founding member, ‘We are Chennai Cycling Group’ (WCCG), said that it was a welcome move. ""But we would need similar steps for those who do the daily commute too, especially on arterial roads,"" he said.

Urban design specialists said that the Chandigarh police through social media has been informing motor vehicles not to encroach the dedicated cycle lanes. ""Signages should be used to inform the riders that the lane is for cyclists. A similar measure can be implemented in Chennai. Fining those who park in these lanes and effective parking management will also help,"" said A.V. Venugopal, senior research associate, Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP)

Ashwathy Dilip, senior programme manager, ITDP, said - ""A cycle may be the only vehicle they own due to their financial condition and they would be cycling long distance for work. There should be sufficient infrastructure through the entire city as a network to help them ride safely too. The pilot is a great step in this direction but it should soon expand into a city-wide network.""",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/n3n3vm/article32962327.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/cycle,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-traffic-police-test-pop-up-lane-for-cycles-on-kamarajar-salai/article32962328.ece
342,2020/10/28,Lockdown brings spotlight back on bicycles,"Lack of infrastructure remains a major deterrent, say those interested in using the pedal power for their daily commute

The COVID-19 pandemic has made many pick up cycling to boost their fitness level and some have even started cycling to work. However, many cyclists complain of lack of safety and stress the need to have adequate infrastructure to encourage cycling.

The Greater Chennai Corporation has set up bicycle lanes of 17 km on two stretches in the city. However, these lanes are mostly occupied by cars and other vehicles, forcing the cyclists to fight for space on the main road. “I used to cycle from Royapuram to my office on Anna Salai till September. However, after traffic increased, I stopped. Drivers of big vehicles do not respect cyclists and since there is no dedicated lane on main roads, it feels risky,” said S.K. Prabhu, who now commutes by a motor vehicle to work.

The fear lingering in the minds of cyclists like him are not unfounded as 45 cyclists were killed and 143 were injured in the city in road accidents in 2019. However, despite the risks, many people continue to cycle.

Divagaran T., founding member of the We Are Chennai Cycling Group (WCCG), said that cycling increased during lockdown as public transport was not available and people wanted to become fitter.

“Post lockdown traffic is coming back to normal. There should be a dedicated lane, so that more people take to cycling. The police should ensure that other vehicles do not use this and cyclists should use it effectively. Cities like Bengaluru have made a lot of arrangements, including setting up pop-up lanes on arterial roads,” he said.

The WCCG and Felix John, who has been chosen “bicycle mayor” of Chennai, has written to Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami several times requesting him to demarcate neighbourhood shopping streets as walking/cycling tracks, create temporary pop-up lanes using cones and expand the city’s bicycle-sharing system with regular sanitising strategies.

“Congestion, over-speeding vehicles and lack of illumination on roads pose dangers for cyclists in the city. After lockdown was lifted, the danger has become more as many are driving their cars and bike in a rash manner as they are taking out the vehicle after a long time,” said Mr. John, who was made the bicycle mayor of Chennai by BYCS Amsterdam, a social enterprise, to promote cycling in Chennai. “However, more and more people are taking to cycling despite all these problems,” he added.

T. Radhakrishnan, who runs Cyclogen, a bicycle shop, said the sale of performance bikes increased in the city after lockdown. “Now many policemen and fire service personnel are purchasing bikes as they have started cycling for fitness. Though the demand has increased, now the supply is affected. The waiting period for even small parts runs to months,” he said.

Safety for women

While many women say that cycling gives them a sense of freedom, they complain of being targeted for harassment by men while riding.

“My friend from Purasawalkam was harassed while she was riding,” said Aparna Shankar, an engineer, who cycles to work daily.

N. Kannan, Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic), said that the traffic police would try using pop up lanes during the early morning hours for those who cycle as a form of exercise. “If there is demand, then we will introduce the system during other hours too. The problem is if we dedicate a lane, it should be utilised or it will be like eating into the space for other vehicles,” he said.

Mr. Kannan said the department valued non-polluting commuters.

“Sadly, pedestrians and cyclists are the common victims of road accidents. Now, as part of the road adoption project, we are removing encroachments from pavements so that pedestrians can use it. We will make roads safe for cyclists and have informed my men to ensure that cyclists do not face any problems on the road,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/zifeb4/article32959601.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THCYCLING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lockdown-brings-spotlight-back-on-bicycles/article32959602.ece
343,2020/10/28,Damaged check dam across Cooum set to be reconstructed,"The structure in Korattur was partially washed away in 2015

The Korattur check dam, with a regulator structure in Tiruvallur district across the unpolluted stretch of the Cooum, that was damaged during the 2015 floods, is set to be reconstructed.

Built in 1879, one of the oldest storage structures in Jamin Korattur is vital in regulating excess flood water to the Chembarambakkam lake which is a drinking water source to the city. The Water Resources Department (WRD) is set to float bids for the ₹32.45-crore project shortly and begin work in two months. Officials said a 50-metre portion of the checkdam was washed away in floods when the river carried 30,000 cusecs of water then. Another 50 to 60 metres of the structure was damaged during the floods.

At present, a temporary embankment has been created in the river near Tiruninravur to divert surplus water to Chembarambakkam lake. Several problems, including funding, had delayed the project.

The reconstructed structure would be 2.5-metre tall across the 140-metre-wide river.

Moreover, the river banks would be strengthened and flood prevention walls built. This would prevent inundation of the neighbouring villages, including Puduchatiram.

Minor repair would be taken up in head sluice that is used to divert water from the river to Chembarambakkam through the 7-km-long new Bangaru channel.

This is the fourth storage structure in the 72-km-long Cooum river.

Besides augmenting drinking water supply to Chennai, the structure that can store up to 10 million cubic feet of water would serve as a groundwater recharge source to surrounding seven or eight villages such as Gudapakkam and Tiruninravur, said an official.

“We expect the watertable to rise by 15 feet once the structure is built. Residents are demanding another storage structure in Sorancheri, 4.5 km downstream of the check dam, in Jamin Korattur,” the official added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/13r0lw/article32958757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THKORATTUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/damaged-check-dam-across-cooum-set-to-be-reconstructed/article32958758.ece
344,2020/10/28,Rainwater harvesting plan for Kovalam basin,"ISWD project to prevent flooding and save rainwater

The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), through the Integrated Stormwater Drain (ISWD) project of the Kovalam Basin, plans to prevent flooding and save rainwater which would go waste into the sea.

In a press meeting organised at the Ripon Building on Tuesday, Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash said as per a study done by the civic body for executing the ISWD project in the Kovalam Basin (divided into three packages of M1, M2 and M3), more than 86% portion of the M3 package located on the East Coast Road (ECR) side are occupied by concrete buildings and vacant lands. Areas such as Kottivakkam, Palavakkam, Neelankarai, Injambakkam, Sholinganallur, Kanathur and Uthandi have seen rapid housing development.

He said: “Of the total rainwater harvesting capacity calculated in the M3 package in the areas being 1,137 hectares, it has been found out that houses and plots occupy 980 hectares. Although these localities are located in sandy terrain, in the December 2015 floods several localities suffered severe flooding.” The flooding in 2015 showed that more than 60% of the rainwater of 470 million litres flowed into the sea with only 305 million litres percolating into the ground, out of total 775 million litres of rainwater realised.

However, the M3 package of the Kovalam basin would be using German technology of installing eco blocks and percolation pits for harvesting rainwater by which more than 325 million litres of rainwater would be harvested.

The Kovalam basin ISWD project involving 360 km is proposed to be executed at a cost of ₹1,243.15 crore. While the M1 and M2 packages would see ISWD being constructed in Perungudi, Pallikaranai, Injambakkam, and Madipakkam, under the M3 package ISWD would be built for 52 km at a cost of ₹270 crore. The civic body would very soon appoint a project management consultant for monitoring and executing the work.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hz3d5n/article32958713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THISWD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rainwater-harvesting-plan-for-kovalam-basin/article32958714.ece
345,2020/10/28,World Bank likely to fund a slew of civic projects in city,"Corporation officials meet bank’s team

The World Bank is expected to fund a number of civic projects, including hospitals under the Chennai City Partnership after March 2021.

At a meeting with World Bank officials on Tuesday, Greater Chennai Corporation officials explained the proposals pertaining to public health, solid waste management and road infrastructure.

“We need better hospital infrastructure post COVID-19. World Bank is expected to fund hospital infrastructure development by the Corporation. World Bank has focused on indicators that point to aspects such as human resources for better delivery of public health services,” said an official.

The Corporation has sought ₹2,400 crore for development of mega street infrastructure in various parts of the city. The World Bank is unlikely to fund the entire project of mega streets covering 116 km. But the first phase of the project is expected at six locations. The officials are likely to fund projects that aim to decongest the city, recognising that reducing vehicle movement was the key to urban mobility. The Corporation officials said their focus would be on public transport-driven mobility supported by safe, comfortable, and connected networks of walking and cycling infrastructure.

Civic officials at a series of meetings with the World Bank have accepted that old school solutions such as flyovers, wider roads, and elevated expressways would make matters worse by attracting more traffic, increasing pollution, and reducing resilience to face future pandemics.

“A final decision is likely to be made by the State government regarding World Bank-funded projects in two weeks,” said a senior civic official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ebczrd/article32235321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WorldBank,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/world-bank-likely-to-fund-a-slew-of-civic-projects-in-city/article32958691.ece

348,2020/10/28,Fines for road traffic violations to be deducted from FASTag accounts,"Corporation and the police will rely on camera footage to identify the violators

Camera footage is likely to be used to identify motorists who violate traffic rules by automating the system of fine collection in the city.

Officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation are planning to automate traffic fine collection using FASTag and the system of cameras fitted across the city by the Corporation and the police.

For instance, a motorist who parks a vehicle in a no-parking zone will be identified by the camera and the fine amount deducted from the FASTag account.

Similarly, in the case of traffic violations at signals, the fine amount would be deducted from the account of the owner of the vehicle. “At least 90% of the vehicles have FASTag in Chennai. The system will deduct the fine amount from the account of violators once the cameras capture violations on road,” said an official.

The Corporation has installed 500 cameras at important junctions of 471 bus route roads.

More cameras will be installed along the roads. The police and other line agencies had installed cameras using funding under smart cities mission.

Meanwhile, work on recruiting parking attendants has started to strengthen parking management in the city.

“COVID-19 has led to reduced collection of parking charges in areas such as T. Nagar and Anna Nagar. We have started recruiting parking attendants to improve services. The parking attendants will carry a hand-held machine to collect charges and regulate parking of vehicles,” said an official.

After relaxation of restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the civic officials planned to strengthen parking management system to prevent unauthorised parking along roads.

The Corporation has planned to create 12,000 parking slots and the system would be expanded to more areas shortly.

Similar to parking violations, the Corporation has also started using analytics for regulating waste management.

It has installed cameras at 50 locations to identify overflowing bins. “We receive two to three alerts every day about overflowing bins. The system facilitates clearance of bins at frequent intervals. More cameras will be fitted to monitor garbage clearance issues,” said an official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/afxdn4/article32958647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THTRAFFICVIOLATIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fines-for-road-traffic-violations-to-be-deducted-from-fastag-accounts/article32958648.ece
349,2020/10/28,GST and the complexity of political negotiations,"With the Centre’s actions in the COVID-19 phase affecting the federal architecture, the danger lies in States following suit

Over the last couple of months, the Centre and States have not been on the same page over issues connected with the Goods and Services Tax (GST). As a result, Centre-State relations have plumbed the depths. This tussle, between the Centre and the States is, however, not uncommon and all federations witness bargaining in some form or other. A diversity of interests is the badge of federalism, and there will be constant negotiation and renegotiation. It is this tension that keeps a federation ticking.

Called one of the most significant fiscal reforms since Independence, the GST replaced numerous central and State taxes with a one single destination-based tax. The Constitutional Amendment overhauled Centre-State relations, with States giving up almost all their powers to tax. In exchange for this bargain, the Centre assured them full compensation, for five years, for all losses arising due to the transition to the GST. A GST Council, made up of the Central and State Finance Ministers, was established and empowered to make recommendations about various issues related to the GST.

This grand federal bargain was severely tested this year following the general economic slowdown and the COVID-19 pandemic induced disruption. Tax collections plummeted which in turn have led to a massive revenue shortfall. In turn, this has also reduced the available resources in the compensation fund. With the GST in place, the Centre held the whip hand and with limited abilities to raise revenues. The States in turn were left staring at a bad deal. The crisis and the unequal relationship created an incentive for the Centre to blur the lines. The Centre it appeared was no longer committed to the agreement and wanted to overturn parts of the deal that were “unfavourable” to it, creating an immense strain on the fragile consensus.

The GST Council strategy

The Centre was averse to providing succour, and when it did, it came with strings attached. For instance, in May 2020, it linked the increase in the fiscal deficit of States from 2% to 3% to reforms in four areas including universalisation of a ‘One Nation-One Ration Card’, electricity distribution, ease of doing business, and urban local body revenues. Similarly, on compensation, the initial noises were that it was not obligated to make good the compensation losses. Most States preferred that the Centre should borrow the entire shortfall and then lend it to States, while the Centre wanted the States to borrow the money directly. The GST Council meetings during this period did not help reduce the trust deficit and break the deadlock but only added fuel to the fire. States had no clue of what the Centre was thinking as there were no statements of intent at the Council meetings. For example, the Finance Minister of Kerala complained that decisions were not being made in the Council but announced subsequently in press meetings.

The disinclination to use the Council was deliberate and intended to prevent “unionised bargaining” by the States. At the same time, by working outside the Council, the Centre was able to exploit asymmetries and divisions between States. In August 2020, States were offered two options to borrow money to meet the shortfall. When a sufficient number of States accepted one of them, the Centre argued that this was the favoured solution. The States, especially those ruled by the Opposition parties, were reluctant to accept this offer and stuck to their preferred position until the Centre finally relented in October. The friction not only shook the foundations of the GST, with at least one State threatening to go to court over the issue, but also exposed the hollowness of the Centre’s hype around cooperative federalism.

Comment | GST reform needs a new grand bargain

The puzzle is why the States agreed to move authority in determining Budget spending (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act earlier) and setting tax rates (value-added tax, or VAT, first and GST now) and in the process shrink their discretionary space to manage their financial affairs. The shift is counter-intuitive, especially since we expect States to protect their autonomy vigorously, and in fact attempt to enlarge their scope. Economic and fiscal federalism scholarship offers us reasonably sound economic and normative reasons for this shift, which include efficiency, equity, stabilisation, economic growth, and balanced development, among others. However, this logic does not make political sense and does not help understand the current new low in the relations between the Centre and States.

Political linkages matter

I argue that the nature of the party system and party linkages matters in Centre-State relations. In the period of Congress dominance, States had few issues when economic management was centralised in the name of development. Their concerns and grievances, if any, were taken up through intra-party channels. The Congress-ruled States went along with the central government given that the locus of power in the party was not at the State level but the Centre. Dissent against centralisation appeared only when non-Congress parties consolidated their position.

The period towards the end of the one-party dominance was especially fractious, and government-Opposition relations increasingly coloured Centre-State relations. To check its competitors, the Congress used (and misused) every available means, including, the use of Article 356, the institution of the Governor and discretionary central grants among others to continue its dominance.

Comment | Making up for shortfalls in GST collection

In sharp contrast to the one-party dominant phase, the coalition era inaugurated a seemingly more cordial period of Centre-State relations based on a recognition of mutual interests. In federal coalitions, States and their interests were made to feel that they were being represented. Ironically, it was during this period, when State-based parties called the shots that much of the authority migration began.

Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha in his memoirs underlines how the Centre chose to remain out of the limelight, and an empowered group of State Finance Ministers helped bring about VAT, the precursor to GST. The GST reforms also followed the same pattern.

This decision-making process gave States both the confidence and ownership of reforms and the new institutions being put in place. State-based parties probably assumed that they would continue to influence national-level decision-making through the new institutions or through coalitions. It follows that authority migration towards the Centre might not make a difference to States/parties if their interests appear to be taken care of by the Centre/party. Party linkages between levels give State-level politicians greater space. In a polity-wide disciplined party, acceding to the central government’s demands may secure the career prospects of State-level leaders. Similarly, for State-based parties, there is access to resources and the possibility of influencing national-level decisions through federal coalitions.

Editorial | An incomplete solution: On Centre borrowing for States

The greater the degree of party centralisation, the higher the possibility of federal centralisation. This explains why the Congress-ruled States did not make a noise during the one-party dominant phase, and the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled States do not do so today. Party linkages between different levels of government are crucial to both the making and the maintenance of federal compacts.

Uphold the player rules

The GST agreement also illustrates the complexity of political negotiations. The bargain quite naturally could not have foreseen 2020. More importantly, the nature of the relationship between the actors involved has changed. From a period in which State-based parties had heft, we now have a one-party formation calling the shots. All institutional arrangements we know have winners and losers; while the winners attempt to maintain status quo, the losers will attempt to overhaul the existing state of affairs. While the States are negotiating within the agreed framework, the Centre’s actions undermine the federal architecture. If this happens consistently over time, there is nothing to stop the States also from doing so.

350,2020/10/28,India’s DisCom stress is more than the sum of its past,"There must be an overhaul of the regulation of electricity firms and their deliverables using common sense metrics

Distribution Companies (DisComs) have been called the lynchpin but also the weakest link in the electricity chain. For all of India’s global leadership for growth of renewable energy, or ambitions of smart energy, the buck stops with the DisComs, the utilities that typically buy power from generators and retail these to consumers. Long gone are the days of scarcity of power; while the physical supply situation has mostly improved, the financial picture has not brightened much — and this was before COVID-19.

More loan than stimulus

The Indian government responded to COVID-19’s economic shock with a stimulus package of ₹20-lakh crore, out of which ₹90,000 crore was earmarked for DisComs (later upgraded to ₹1,25,000 crore). While it was called a stimulus, it is really a loan, meant to be used by DisComs to pay off generators. Our recent study on DisComs shows a much graver picture than one that can be solved by a fill-up, even though such a liquidity injection is required (but probably insufficient).

Also read | A reformative and fiscal package

Newspaper reports abound with stories of how DisComs owe one lakh crore rupees to generators, and without such an infusion the chain will collapse. Unfortunately, the dues to generators are several times higher than this number, and, worse, the total short-term dues of DisComs are multiple times higher, which excludes long-term debt.

Data on liabilities

How did this magic figure of one-lakh crore capture popular imagination? This figure is roughly what the government’s PRAAPTI (or Payment Ratification And Analysis in Power procurement for bringing Transparency in Invoicing of generators) portal shows for DisCom dues to generators. However, what is not widely appreciated is that the portal is a voluntary compilation of dues, and is not comprehensive. The Power Finance Corporation (PFC)’s Report on Utility Workings for 2018-19 showed dues to generators were ₹2,27,000 crore, and this is well before COVID-19. It also showed similar Other Current Liabilities. Our analysis shows that what has happened over the years is that DisComs have delayed their payments upstream (not just to generators but others as well) — in essence, treating payables like an informal loan. But why do DisComs not pay on time? Conventional wisdom blames the utilities for inefficiency, including high losses, called Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses, a term that spans everything from theft to lack of collection from consumers. However, this is only an incomplete explanation.

To understand what is going on, we have to dig into all the accounts of DisComs. Ideally, they should not incur losses as they enjoy a regulated rate of return. While AT&C losses can explain part of any gap, the first problem starts at the regulatory level where even if DisComs performed as targeted, across India, they would face a non-trivial cash flow gap, which was ₹60,000-plus crore in FY18-19 compared to their then annual cost structure of ₹7.23-lakh crore.

Also read | ‘Power backup’ will help ease liquidity pressure on discoms

Then, we have the severe challenge of payables to DisComs. These dues are of three types. First, regulators themselves have failed to fix cost-reflective tariffs thus creating Regulatory Assets, which are effectively IOUs, which are to be recovered through future tariff hikes. Second, about a seventh of DisCom cost structures is meant to be covered through explicit subsidies by State governments. Third, consumers owed DisComs over ₹1.8 lakh crore in FY 2018-19, booked as trade receivables.

States as defaulters

State governments are the biggest defaulters, responsible for an estimated a third of trade receivables, besides not paying subsidies in full or on time. On an annual cash flow basis, the shortfall in subsidy payments appears very low — only about 1% — but cumulative unpaid subsidies, with modest carrying costs, make DisComs poorer by over ₹70,000 crore just over the last 10 years.

Also read | Centre relaxes norms for PFC, REC to lend to discoms

This earlier equilibrium of increasing the dues as well as relying on continued subsidies (not to mention extensive cross subsidies between consumer categories) all worked as long as there was steady growth. However, such muddling along cannot suffice. To begin with, COVID-19 has completely shattered incoming cash flows to utilities. While there was a multi-month dip in demand, the revenue implications were far worse since the lockdown disproportionately impacted revenues from so-termed paying customers, commercial and industrial segments. On the flip side, reduced demand for electricity did not save as much because a large fraction of DisCom cost structures are locked in through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) that obligate capital cost payments, leaving only fuel savings with lower offtake.

We will probably need a much larger liquidity infusion than has been announced thus far, but it also must go hand-in-hand with credible plans to pay down growing debt. Stimulus loans are near market term and not soft loans. If there is a haircut to be taken, all the risk and future obligations should not be placed on DisComs alone. Generators, transmission companies, and lending institutions must all chip in. Else, we risk kicking the can down the road until we may require another future support package if not bailout.

Comment | Amendments to the Electricity Bill will erode concurrent status given to electricity

Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of time to put the house in order.

Renewable energy beckons

The rise of renewable energy means that premium customers will leave the system partly first by reducing their daytime usage. And as battery technologies mature, their dependence on DisComs may wane entirely. Even without batteries, regulations permitting, they may want to find third party suppliers under competitive models.

So what is the solution other than simply throwing money at the problem? Improving AT&C losses is important, but will not be sufficient. We need a complete overhaul of the regulation of electricity companies and their deliverables. Much of inefficiency is tolerated in the name of the poor but they do not get quality supply. We need to apply common sense metrics of lifeline electricity supply instead of the political doleout of free electricity even for those who may not deserve such support. For the rest, regulators must allow cost-covering tariffs. The financial problems of DisComs have been brewing for many years, and it is unlikely that a silver bullet, even privatisation, can solve the problems overnight. However, if business as usual was not even good enough before COVID-19, it will not be workable for the current national needs of quality, affordable, and sustainable power.

Amid the new surge in cases in Europe and the U.S., and the still high numbers in India and South America, the situation as far as COVID-19 is concerned looks desperate. There is a need for a fresh approach. If China tests 4.5 million in four days in a city against a dozen reported cases, there is no need for the world to be in awe and struggle to chase its method. Perhaps the focus now should be on those reporting sick and those getting hospitalised. The numbers do not make any sense any more. Also, finding a cure is the action, with the medicines easy to handle, affordable, effective at all levels and free from any commercial encumbrances.

Pacts with America

It is more than apparent that the U.S. views India as a potential counterweight to the growing clout of cash-rich China and curb its ruthless debt-trap diplomacy and military-muscle-flexing. The high-profile U.S. visits just days before the American elections is also a pointer to an obvious bid of the Trump administration to woo the sizeable Indian diaspora. The defence pacts with the U.S. is wont to ruffle Russia’s feathers. Nonetheless, India must tread cautiously and ensure that there is reciprocity in the bilateral deals. It must make sure that its military’s autonomy is in no way compromised.

Mumbai Police have traced the man who allegedly stabbed TV actress Malvi Malhotra with a knife, but he is yet to be arrested as he is hospitalised, a police official said on Wednesday.

The accused, Yogesh Mahipal Singh, was on Tuesday night traced to a hospital at Vasai in neighbouring Palghar district, located about 50 km from here, he said.

According to the actress, Singh allegedly stabbed her in the abdomen and both hands in Versova area of Mumbai on Monday night as she had refused his marriage proposal.

After attacking her, the accused fled in his car.

The actress is currently undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Mumbai, the police said.

On Tuesday, the accused was found at a Vasai-based hospital where a Versova police team went and enquired with him about the incident, the official said.

“He has not yet been arrested as he his hospitalised for some treatment,” the official said.

Another police team is likely to go the hospital in Vasai on Wednesday for further inquiry into the case, he said.

The actress told the police that she knew the accused since last one year and he wanted to marry her, but she rejected the proposal, the official said.

Actor Rhea Chakraborty on Tuesday urged the Bombay High Court to dismiss a plea filed by sisters of the late actor Sushant Singh Rajput seeking to quash the FIR registered by her on abetting Sushant’s death.

A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Shinde and M.S. Karnik was hearing a plea filed by Meetu and Priyanka Singh seeking to quash the FIR filed on September 7 by the Bandra police.

Ms. Chakraborty, in her reply filed through advocate Satish Maneshinde, said, “As per the prescription dated June 8, 2020, Dr. Tarun Kumar prescribed Nexito 5 mg, Librium 5 mg and Lonazep MD 0.5 mg to Sushant for anxiety. That it is pertinent to note that the tablet Librium is Chlordiazepoxide which appears at Item No.36 in the list of psychotropic substances under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS), while Nexito and Lonazep MD both contain Clonazepam which appears in the list of psychotropic substances under the NDPS Act. Sushant died merely five days after he obtained the said prescription wherein he was unlawfully prescribed psychotropic substances at the behest of sister [Priyanka] and Dr. Tarun Kumar.”

The petition filed by the sisters stated, “No criminality can be attributed to the petitioners when the cause of action is attributed to the doctor. The FIR has been registered based on a complaint which is wrought with material irregularities and discrepancies. The FIR has been registered after inordinate delay of 90 days without explanation.”

356,2020/10/28,A colouring book for children from Tamil Nadu’s fishing community,"In Season Fish has put together a marine-themed colouring book to be distributed to children across Tamil Nadu’s coast

There was excitement amidst children of the seaside village of Alamparai, near Puducherry. They lined up at the village square to receive a precious package: a colouring book and colour pencils from a team from Chennai.

This was last weekend, when wildlife biologist Chaitanya Krishna and marine geographer Divya Karnad of In Season Fish, a sustainable seafood initiative, had visited the village. “They leafed through the book and were curious,” recalls Chaitanya.

The colouring book, titled Art to Heal, was the result of several weeks of work during lockdown. It has sketches by 39 artists — one from Australia and the rest from across India — themed on the marine world. It features line drawings of marine life including whales, sharks and turtles found in Indian coastal waters. With text in English and Tamil, the book has a fun Spot The Fish exercise that asks children to identify the species they colour.

Chaitanya and team distributed the book and colour pencils to around 70 children in the village, and will continue the exercise across fishing villages in Tamil Nadu and later, among children living inland too.

Chaitanya says, it all began as In Season Fish’s “Covid relief work”. “We distributed rice, dal, and oil to 1,000 fisherfolk families from Tiruvallur, Ennore, Cuddalore, Tuticorin, Nagapattinam, and Rameshwaram in April to help supplement their savings.” The pandemic was hard on the fisherfolk since they could not head out to sea for several weeks. “This took care of their physical well-being. But what about their mental well-being?” asks Chaitanya.

And so they came up with the idea of putting together a colouring book. “Children missed their school environment. We hoped the book would keep them engaged as well as keep their memory of the sea and all its creatures alive,” explains Chaitanya. In April, the team put out a request on its social media handle asking for artists to contribute and slowly, the book took shape.

Madhuri Tarimane is among the artists who contributed. “I’m from the coastal region myself,” says Madhuri, speaking over phone from Bengaluru. “I spent my early childhood in Karwar, Karnataka.” Which is why when she came across the opportunity, she did not let it go. “It also helped me cope during lockdown; I was stressed due to all the uncertainty,” she says. Madhuri also teaches children art and knows that it can be therapeutic. “Children have so much energy in them and art is a good way to channelise it,” she adds.

Chaitanya says that through Art To Heal, they plan to strike a rapport with people in the various fishing villages and start a conversation about conserving marine species and ocean health. The book, therefore, is just the beginning.

357,2020/10/28,Heard of Hitler beetle or Greta spider?,"New species are being discovered almost every day. And each one must get a new scientific name. Or how else would scientists from different regions know if they’re discussing the Indian robin or the European robin?

Naming is an interesting prodecure done with scientific precision (and occasionally with scientists having fun!).

For decades now, species have been named after celebrities and popular fictional characters too.

Let’s take a look at some names – from interesting to bizarre!

THE FAMOUS

• Greta Thunberg: Synonymous with climate activism, this 17-year-old Swede has at least three creatures named after her in just the last two years - Thunberga greta (huntsman spider); Craspedotropis gretathunbergae (snail); and Nelloptodes gretae (beetle). The beetle seems to have antennae resembling her long pigtail. But scientist Michael Darby says he chose the name because he was “immensely impressed” with her campaigning.

• Charles Darwin: Not surprisingly, the naturalist best-known for his contribution to evolution, is among those after whom several species have been named. The number’s a whopping 200-plus species. The list includes everything from bugs and beetles to algae, flies and primates.

David Attenborough in the Netflix documentary

• David Attenborough: Not less than 25 species and genera (both living and extinct) have been named after this British natural historian and broadcaster. Seems fitting for a person who has been bringing wildlife alive from even the remotest corners of the world through his television series for decades now. Among others, a Mesozoic reptile, an extinct marsupial lion, a 430-million-year-old crustacean fossil, and a fan-throated lizard discovered in India have been named after him.

• Barack Obama: Though political leaders have had species named after them, their numbers cannot hold a candle to this former U.S. President’s. He has at least 10 species named after him - a hat-tip to his passion for science - and this includes fossils, birds, spiders, etc.

HONOURABLE MENTIONS

• Michelle Obama: Spintharus michelleobamaae, a “smiley-faced” spider, named after the former U.S. First Lady.

• A.P.J. Abdul Kalam: Drypetes kalamii, a small shrub, and Solibacillus kalamii, a microbe discovered on the International Space Station, named after the former Indian President.

Name and fame: Drypetes kalami. Photos: Special Arrangement

• J.R.R. Tolkien: At least two species of wasps, a clam, a crustacean, and a beetle named after this writing genius.

• Bagheera: Bagheera kiplingi, a Central American jumping, vegetarian spider, named after Bagheera, the loveable panther in “The Jungle Book” and the book’s writer.

• Batman: Otocinclus batmani, a South American fish, named after the masked superhero for the bat-shaped vertical spot on its fin.

AND THE INFAMOUS

• Adolf Hitler: The blind cave beetle Anophthalmus hitleri is said to have been named by an entomologist with admiration for Hitler. But there are suggestions that naming a blind beetle after the dictator was actually an implicit sign of ridicule. Though we don’t know the truth one way or the other, the poor beetle is paying the price for its association with an infamous tyrant. It has been suffering poaching at the hands of the collectors of items related to Nazi Germany.

Fantastic names and where they came from

In an unusual case of fiction inspiring reality, several species have been named after characters from the iconic Harry Potter series. The latest to join the list is a new species of venomous pit viper found in the Himalayas. It has been named Trimeresurus salazar (the Salazar’s pit viper) after Salazar Slytherin, the founder of Slytherin house and one who can speak Parseltongue, the language of snakes.

A few other Harry Potter inspirations include Eriovixia gryffindori (a spider discovered in the Western Ghats and resembling the sorting hat owned by Godric Gryffindor); Harryplax severus (a secretive crab named after Hogwarts teacher Severus Snape, who carried a secret to death himself); and Ampulex dementor (a parasitic wasp that injects venom into cockroaches and turning them into zombies, similar to how dementors suck the soul out of their targets).

How to name it

Researchers or scientists who chance upon a new species have the liberty to give it a new (scientific) name of their choice. Usually, species are named to honour another respected scientist or someone they’re close to. Naming a species after oneself is frowned upon within the community and could be seen as arrogance or being in poor taste.

Species are also named after the place they are found in or for their characteristics or resemblance to someone or something else. This is where celebrities and fictional characters come in. It is hoped that having a popular name would give the species more attention and interest than it would otherwise.

Here’s an example. When a threatened moth species was named Neopalpa donaldtrumpi after Donald Trump, it was not only for its resemblance to the U.S. President’s hairdo but also “to bring wider public attention to the need to continue protecting fragile habitats in the US that still contain many undescribed species”.

J. Vijaya is India’s first woman herpetologist. Uncommon for women during the 1980s, she travelled the country widely for research. She also studied extensively the forest cane turtle (back then called Heosemys silvatica). In 1987, aged only 28, she was found dead in a forest. In 2006 - 19 years after her death - the cane turtle was renamed Vijayachelys silvatica. This is a “monotypic” genus, meaning it’s one of a kind. Perhaps the same can be said of Vijaya too.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7j9wab/article32220552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXBRITAINGRETATHUNBERG,https://www.thehindu.com/children/heard-of-hitler-beetle-or-greta-spider/article32960827.ece

A washoku meal follows the principle of “ichi ju san sai” — “one soup, three side dishes”. So, the meal consists of a bowl of rice, accompanied by miso soup — produced by fermenting soya beans, salt and other spices — and side dishes made with a variety of seasonal ingredients.

Initially, due to the Buddhist influence, meat was forbidden but later the Japanese embraced sea food, and more recently beef and pork.

On the menu

Washoku included vegetables and seafood dipped in a light batter and deep fried, famously known as tempura. Noodles — like soba (long, thin noodles made with buckwheat flour) and udon (thick and chewy white flour noodles) served in fish broth known as oden — are an inherent part of the meal.

Nikujaga (meat and potatoes), kabocha no nimono (pumpkin in soy sauce and dashi broth), and buri daikon are some of the dishes made using a slow-cooking technique called nimono. Other popular dishes include Sashimi (thinly sliced raw fish, sushi, tsukemono), pickled vegetables, and Yakizakana or grilled fish. Japanese cuisine avoids oil and fat, paving the way for a healthy lifestyle.

Social significance

Besides food, Washoku is also about the traditions and practice including the structure of the menu, plating, and the use of traditional cutlery. Most importantly, the meals are served with omotenashi, the country’s renowned hospitality rules.

The rice is served in a small bowl called the chawan. Each item of the main course is served in tiny plates known as sara or in a bowl known as hachi. Etiquette demands that the side dishes must be in individual plates or partitioned on a plate by leaves.

Washoku survived the radical political, social and economic changes in Japan and made it to UNESCO’s List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2013.

Fun fact: Fugu, the Japanese pufferfish, contains one of the world’s most potent toxins. Fugu chefs must be licensed to remove the potentially deadly organs. Despite the risk, around 10,000 tons of fugu is eaten annually in Japan, where it is considered a winter delicacy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/w9d5r5/article32960352.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30ytfood-1,https://www.thehindu.com/children/learn-more-about-the-washoku-the-centuries-old-japanese-meal/article32960358.ece
359,2020/10/28,"For second consecutive day, Puducherry records no deaths","With 147 new cases, the Union Territory’s overall tally reaches 34,482; case fatality rate stands at 1.71%

For the second consecutive day, no COVID-19 deaths were reported in the Union Territory while 147 new cases took the overall tally to 34,482 cases.

The new cases were detected from testing 3,570 samples in the last 24 hours.

The test positivity rate was 4.11%, case fatality rate 1.71% and recovery rate stood at 87.45%.

Puducherry accounted for 72 of the new cases, followed by Mahe (35), Yanam (30) and Karaikal (10).

Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao cautioned that though the active cases showed a declining trend, the public should not get the wrong idea that the coronavirus threat had disappeared. The active cases which had been in the 4,000 to 5,000 range at the beginning of the month were now in the 3,000-4,000 range. The Minister urged the public to continue to adhere to wearing masks, distancing and sanitising guidelines.

The overall tally in the Union Territory stood at 588 deaths, 3,741 active cases, a cumulative total of 34,482 cases and 30,153 recovered patients.

The Health Department has till date tested 2,93,626 samples of which 2,56,349 returned negative.

Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi has called for increasing testing among vulnerable groups, such as those on old age pension. Chairing a review with health officials, Ms. Bedi said surprise tests at random timings/post sunset would be made to cover sections of society who might not have been tested so far.

Notification of hot spots/caution zones are to be shared by COVID War Room on a day-to-day basis to enable the Director General of Police to deploy and brief his officers appropriately.

Pursuant to receipt of reports from the field about laxity in following COVID-19-appropriate behaviour, such as social distancing or improper wearing of masks, there is a necessity to ramp up IEC activities while simultaneously, enforcing regulation, the Lt. Governor said.

She suggested that tag lines of COVID-19-appropriate behaviour be made part of official letter heads and in all official correspondence and e-mails.

To strengthen IEC campaigns, jingles relayed by All India Radio need to be translated to vernacular languages and played through cable networks and the LED on Promenade Beach. Live performances by school students/other artists adhering to COVID-19 etiquette is also proposed. Mobile teams have been directed to record COVID-19 violations in shops and markets and display it on the LED screens on the beach for people to see themselves for compliance.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/wiimfd/article32958859.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THTESTPY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/for-second-consecutive-day-puducherry-records-no-deaths/article32958860.ece
360,2020/10/28,Puducherry Cabinet for 10% quota in MBBS seats for government school students,"Their representation is very less, says Chief Minister

The Puducherry Cabinet has recommended implementation of 10% reservation for government school students in medical admissions. Addressing a press conference here, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said the Cabinet met on Monday night and decided to provide quota to government school students as their representation in medical colleges was very less.

As many as 48,269 students are pursuing Class 6-12 at government schools. While the number of students in the same classes at private schools is 88,000. During the 2018-19 academic year, 94 students who passed out of government schools cleared NEET. The number of private school students who cleared the test was 1,346. But only 16 government school students could get admission in medical colleges as against 243 private school students, the Chief Minister said.

Of the 16 students, 11 were from Mahe, 3 from Karaikal and 2 from Puducherry, he said.

The number revealed that only very few government school students got admission to medical colleges. Hence the Cabinet decided to set aside 10% of the seats that medical colleges surrendered under the government quota for government school students. A detailed guideline would be issued shortly, he said.

When it was pointed out that a similar decision by the Tamil Nadu government was awaiting assent from the Governor, Mr. Narayanasamy said he was hopeful of getting the sanction of Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi. “If not, we will launch an agitation,” he said.

He said the Supreme Court’s stand on implementation of 50% reservation this year itself for NEET-UG students belonging to Other Backward Classes in medical and dental seats in seats provided to all India quota by State government run colleges in Tamil Nadu would deprive hundreds of students from socially marginalised sections admission in medical seats. The decision would go against ensuring social justice, the Chief Minister said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/t1fduk/article32958788.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THNARAYANASAMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/puducherry-cabinet-for-10-quota-in-mbbs-seats-for-government-school-students/article32958789.ece

362,2020/10/28,Party leaders back teachers’ protest,"Kiran Bedi to hold talks with officials to resolve issue

Several political leaders cutting across party lines have come out in support of the agitation by government-aided school teachers demanding release of pay arrears of over 10 months.

Over 200 teachers stayed put at the police community hall in Gorimedu on Tuesday. The teachers had been brought here on Monday after being arrested by the police while taking out a march to the Raj Nivas under the banner of the Puducherry Government Aided School Teachers and Employees Federation.

Meanwhile, Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi has scheduled a meeting with the Director and the Secretary of School Education to resolve the issue.

Among those who addressed the protesters were Deputy Speaker M.N.R. Balan, K. Lakshminarayanan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Chief Minister, and A. John Kumar, MLA of the Congress, A. Anbalagan (AIADMK) and N.S.J. Jayabal (AINRC).

T.R. Seshaachalam, general secretary of the Puducherry Government Aided School Teachers and Employees Federation, said the blocking of the pay was owing to a misunderstanding among authorities. The fee fixation committee headed by a former Judge of the Madras High Court in 2017, while stipulating a cap on tuition fees after accounting all running cost expenses, had specifically stated that this did not include salaries or pensions of aided teachers.

Besides, since 2013, the salaries and pension of aided teachers was being released directly to the beneficiaries as government grants and was not in any manner channelled through the managements, he pointed out. “Somehow, authorities got the wrong impression by linking tuition fees and teachers’ pay,” Mr. Seshaachalam added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/8bfti/article32958436.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27OCTTHPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/party-leaders-back-teachers-protest/article32958437.ece

The path was reportedly created by an individual to ‘access his land’ on the other side of the channel.

The delay in action by officials after the issue was brought to the notice of Revenue and Public Works Departments irked local farmers.

Backed by TNVS, the farmers cautioned that they would remove the encroachment by themselves on Wednesday. As they got ready to get into the act, Revenue and PWD officials rushed to the spot and initiated necessary steps to clear the encroachment.

366,2020/10/28,Air quality monitoring station commissioned,"Facility envisages tracking all parameters of various places

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday commissioned Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board’s Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) at Bharathidasan University and St. Joseph’s College.

The facility, each costing ₹2 crore, was started at 25 locations across the State. The data from the stations would enable government agencies to keep the general public informed about the current level of air pollution, and formulate strategies, policies and decisions, besides generating knowledge on the long-term and short-term implications on public health.

The establishment of ambient air quality station provided direction for management of air quality, maintenance of ecological safety and conservation, and creation of sustainable environment for human society and nature, officials said.

The station was inaugurated at Bharathidasan University in the presence of Vice-Chancellor P. Manisankar, Registrar G. Gopinath, Joint Chief Environmental Engineer K. Elankumaran, District Environmental Engineer R. Lakshmi and other senior officials.

The establishment of CAAQMS was a sequel to the memorandum of understanding signed by the university’s Department of Environmental Biotechnology with TNPCB.

According to officials, all parameters of air quality such as sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone molecule, gaseous ammonia, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, BTX – Benzene, Toluene, Xylene, and meteorological parameters — rainfall, solar radiation, wind direction, wind speed, temperature and humidity — would be monitored continuously by TNPCB and IIT-Madras.

The data from the station could be used by scientists, academicians and students for teaching and research purpose, the Vice-Chancellor said.

Featuring measuring instruments and display units, the CAAQMS facility at St. Joseph’s College had been made useful to the public through installation of LCD board for projection of real-time data.

The facility envisaged tracking air quality in various places, including residential localities, industrial sites, commercial locations and roadside areas to a five-km distance in the surroundings, College Principal Rev. Fr. M. Arockiasamy Xavier said.

Monitoring helped in assessing the level of pollution in relation to the ambient air quality standards, and set the target for pollution reduction. The college would conduct awareness programmes at the local level for students and the general public of the importance of environment and health and secure projects from national agencies for broad-basing efforts for pollution control, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/oraih5/article32965971.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY29-AIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/air-quality-monitoring-station-commissioned/article32965972.ece
367,2020/10/28,Business complex in knee-deep sewage,"Concern over health hazards posed to customers and residents

Stagnation of sewage water in the basement floor of a commercial complex on Madurai road has posed serious health hazards to customers and local residents.

Customers visiting SBI, UCO Bank and the regional office of the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation and other private commercial establishments at Shree complex undergo untold sufferings due to stagnation of the sewage water.

Knee-deep sewage, discharged by commercial establishments and those staying in the building, has been stagnating for more than two weeks, emitting a pungent stench and turning the area into a breeding ground for vectors. With sewage water occupying the entire basement floor, it looks like a pool.

Apparently, sewage generated from the building could not be discharged into the storm water drain on Madurai road ever since the construction of the drain began a few weeks ago. A few other complexes also face the issue. Since the outlet points have been blocked, the onus on clearing sewage has been passed on to owners of the complexes and buildings. Some of them engage private players to clear sewage water. However, the evidently half-hearted efforts have failed. There is also a view that the Corporation, which is supposed to ensure smooth flow of sewage and domestic waste, has passed the buck on users.

The tussle has ultimately caused hardship to hundreds of customers, pensioners and others, who visit the commercial complexes. It poses serious threat to public health to provident fund members, and elderly persons, who visit the EPFO office to get their grievance redressed. They fear that it will spread diseases especially when people are already going through trying times due to the spread of COVID-19.

“The customers face untold sufferings due to the problem. It is time the issue issue gets solved before the onset of monsoon,” says Shashikant Dahiya, Assistant Provident Fund Commissioner, Tiruchi.

The tenants and the establishments that function in the complex took up the issue with the Corporation and owner of the building.

Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian told The Hindu that he had personally visited the spot to take stock of the situation. The sewage stagnation posed the danger of spreading diseases. Hence, the owner and tenants of the complex had been served notices to solve the issue within seven days. Else, action would be taken against the responsible persons under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/business-complex-in-knee-deep-sewage/article32965543.ece

371,2020/10/28,First freight train sets off on Mayiladuthurai-Thanjavur energised stretch,"Trial run was carried out on 68-km track recently

An electric loco-hauled freight train was operated on Mayiladuthurai-Thanjavur stretch for the first time after the broad gauge section was energised following completion of overhead electrification works.

Transporting fertilizer from Bilaspur, the freight train arrived at Thanjavur junction at 7.40 p.m. on Tuesday after a halt at Mayiladuthurai on the mainline section that falls under Tiruchi Railway Division.

Ahead of operation of the freight train on the 68-km stretch via Kumbakonam, a trial run was carried out successfully a few days ago after completion of overhead electrification works by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, a Government of India enterprise under the Ministry of Railways.

This was the last and final stretch of the 228-km mainline section from Villupuram to Thanjavur via Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Mayiladuthurai and Kumbakonam to be electrified. The portion from Villupuram to Mayiladuthurai was electrified earlier.

A senior railway official told The Hindu on Wednesday that the freight train was operated on the newly energised stretch after obtaining approval from the Southern Railway General Manager on Tuesday. However, statutory clearance from the Commissioner of Railway Safety, Southern Circle, Bengaluru, was mandatory for operation of passenger trains on the section.

Meanwhile, a senior RVNL official said the organisation submitted relevant documents to the Commissioner of Railway Safety pertaining to completion of overhead electrification works on the Mayiladuthurai-Thanjavur stretch and invited the top official to conduct mandatory inspection of the track. The inspection by the Commissioner of Railway Safety is expected to be carried out next month.

RVNL was entrusted with the task of executing the overhead electrification project on the entire mainline section from Villupuram to Thanjavur at a cost of around ₹300 crore. Two new traction substations — at Cuddalore and Thanjavur — were constructed as part of the project and commissioned earlier.

The mainline section with single track is one of the important stretches under the Tiruchi division to have become fully electrified.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/first-freight-train-sets-off-on-mayiladuthurai-thanjavur-energised-stretch/article32964106.ece
372,2020/10/28,World Cup 2022: Qatar hoping for more Indian eyeballs,"Matches scheduled at convenient timings cited as a reason

The organisers of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar are expecting more Indian eyeballs than during the 2018 edition as the matches will be played at convenient timings for the audience in the country, the CEO Nasser Al Khater said on Wednesday.

Qatar will become the first country in the Middle East to host the mega sporting event, which will kick off from November 21, 2022.

“It (FIFA World Cup) may not be as gigantic (in India) as the cricket World Cup but the FIFA World Cup 2018 in Russia drew broadcast audiences of nearly 300 million in India and this is only going to go further up in 2022,” Khater told PTI in an interview.

“In India, majority of matches will kick-off at convenient times. During group stage, the first game will start at 15:30 IST and the last game at 00:30 IST. The second and third matches at 18:30 and 21:30 IST respectively, which will both be consumed by prime time evening broadcast audience in India.”

Affordable event

Khater said Qatar is committed to deliver an affordable and exciting experience to anyone who visits the country during the World Cup.

“We are committed to delivering an exciting, memorable and affordable FIFA World Cup for everyone visiting in 2022, particularly in light of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.

“Despite the hard times we live in, we will ensure that 2022 remains affordable for everyone,” he said.

According to Khater, Qatar will welcome Indian clubs if they want to use the facilities.

“Indian clubs are always welcome to Qatar, whether for training or competition, and I am certain that anyone who makes the trip will enjoy world class facilities and our renowned hospitality,” he added.

Sharing technology

Qatar had used cooling systems at FIFA World Cup stadiums during the AFC Champions League matches in September and the top official said that they were ready to share the technology with countries having similar climate.

“This was driven by several legacy considerations...to use these venues year-round in the lead up to and after 2022.

“This was a benefit witnessed first hand during the AFC Champions League, and a demonstration of how this legacy is taking shape before 2022,” he said.

“We are definitely open to sharing our knowledge and expertise when it comes to the cooling technology with any country with a similar climate to Qatar who may benefit from it.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/world-cup-2022-qatar-hoping-for-more-indian-eyeballs/article32965990.ece
373,2020/10/28,Champions League | Casemiro saves Real’s blushes,"His strike helps the side draw with Monchengladbach

Casemiro scored a last-gasp equaliser as Real Madrid fought back from two goals down to snatch a 2-2 draw against Borussia Monchengladbach on Tuesday, avoiding a second straight loss in the Champions League.

Marcus Thuram’s double had put the German outfit on course for a famous victory, but Real roared back with late efforts from Karim Benzema and Casemiro — three minutes into added time — to salvage a point.

But Real remained at the bottom of Group B after its shock 3-2 home defeat against a depleted Shakhtar Donetsk side in the opener. Shakhtar was three points clear at the top after a goalless draw with Inter Milan in another encounter.

Despite having more than 60% possession, Real rarely troubled Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer until the frantic final moments.

It was Gladbach which scored just after the half-hour mark. A poor pass by Toni Kroos put Real under pressure in its own half. Gladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann snapped up the loose ball and fed Alassane Plea, whose pin-point low pass to Thuram was buried into the back of the net.

Thuram, the son of French 1998 World Cup winner Lilian Thuram, pounced to score his second in the 58th. However, Zidane’s men fought back to share the honours.

Holder Bayern Munich needed a Joshua Kimmich strike to claim a 2-1 win at Lokomotiv Moscow in Group A. Joao Felix scored twice, including a late winner, as Atletico Madrid came from behind to beat Salzburg 3-2.

Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City eased to a second straight win in Group C while Liverpool defeated Danish champion Midtjylland 2-0 in a low-key game in Group D. Atalanta came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at home to Ajax, thanks to Duvan Zapata’s brace.

374,2020/10/28,"Champions League | City thrash woeful Marseille, Liverpool labour to 2-0 win over Midtjylland","Ferran Torres, Ilkay Gundogan and Raheem Sterling found the back of the net as Pep Guardiola's side while Salah and Jota rescue Klopp’s team

Manchester City were barely troubled as they claimed their second victory in Champions League Group C by beating Olympique de Marseille 3-0 at the Stade Velodrome on Tuesday.

Ferran Torres, Ilkay Gundogan and Raheem Sterling found the back of the net as Pep Guardiola's side stayed top of the standings on six points, three ahead of Porto and Olympiakos.

Marseille are bottom of the table on zero points after their 10th consecutive loss in the competition since two defeats in the quarter-finals against Bayern Munich in 2012 and after six defeats in the group stage in 2013-14, in their last appearance.

OM, who lost 1-0 at Olympiakos on their return to the Champions League after a seven-year hiatus, travel to Porto and City host Olympiakos in the next round of matches on Nov. 3.

After their 3-1 home win against Porto last week, City got off to a dominant start, pushing Marseille back and winning three corners in the opening 10 minutes.

Marseille were shambolic at the back and paid for it in the 18th minute when Valentin Rongier inexplicably passed the ball to Kevin De Bruyne on the edge of the box, with Torres burying it in the net after being set up by the Belgian.

Oleksandr Zinchenko came close to making it 2-0 when his crossed shot shaved Steve Mandanda's left-hand post after another piece of horrible defending from the hosts.

Marseille were a bit more lively after the break, defending higher up, and Florian Thauvin came close in the 55th, only for his 25-metre missile to be tipped on to the post by Ederson.

City finally made their superiority count after 76 minutes as Gundogan struck home after Sterling's fluffed header from Phil Foden's cross came his way at the far post.

Sterling wrapped it up five minutes later, tapping the ball home from De Bruyne's cross at the end of a long spell of possession.

Slow start for Liverpool

Liverpool laboured to a 2-0 win over Denmark's Midtjylland on Tuesday with goals from Diogo Jota and a Mohamed Salah penalty in a Champions League Group D match at Anfield.

Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp, however, suffered another defensive blow with Brazilian Fabinho limping off in the first half with what appeared to be a hamstring injury.

Liverpool made a slow start and suffered an early scare when Anders Dreyer broke through the middle but shot straight at keeper Alisson.

With Klopp having rested his usual front three and given starts to Jota, Divock Origi and Xherdan Shaqiri, Liverpool struggled to break down the determined Danes.

The breakthrough came in the 55th minute when Trent Alexander-Arnold's low cross was turned in from close range by Jota.

Salah made sure of the win, in stoppage time, from the penalty spot, converting after he had been brought down inside the box.

375,2020/10/28,FC Barcelona president Bartomeu resigns after Messi row,"Josep Maria Bartomeu said he accepted a proposal for FC Barcelona to play in “a future European Super League” which “would guarantee the financial stability of the club”.

Josep Maria Bartomeu resigned as Barcelona president on Tuesday, along with his board of directors, and left with a bombshell admission that he had accepted a proposal for the club to play in “a future European Super League”.

Bartomeu’s departure comes following mounting pressure from fans and his public falling out with Lionel Messi.

His resignation could even affect the future of Messi, who will now be given a new project after the Argentinian tried to leave in August, citing a lack of direction at the club.

“I want to communicate my resignation along with the rest of the board,” said Bartomeu in a official announcement. “It’s a composed and relaxed decision, agreed with all my fellow directors.”

However, it was his revelation about a Super League which seems certain to make the biggest waves beyond Catalonia.

Bartomeu said he accepted a proposal on Monday for Barcelona to play in “a future European Super League” which “would guarantee the financial stability of the club”.

An election for Bartomeu’s successor will take place within the next three months, although it is expected to happen sooner, while an interim board will be put in charge in the meantime.

Bartomeu will go down as arguably the worst president in Barcelona’s history. His six-year tenure saw a dramatic decline in the performances of the team and he oversaw Messi, the club’s greatest ever player, trying to leave the club for free.

His resignation means avoiding a vote of no confidence, which had been triggered after more than 20,000 Barcelona members signed a petition for him to be removed following a nightmare period on and off the pitch.

Attempts to delay the vote, including citing an investigation into false signatures and problems caused by coronavirus, were rejected by the local government in Catalonia, with Bartomeu finally quitting on Tuesday night following a board meeting.

A series of political blunders had long caused a rift between the board and senior players, before Barca ended last season with a humiliating 8-2 defeat at the hands of Bayern Munich in the Champions League.

Messi then shocked the world of football by informing the club he wanted to depart and while he was forced to admit defeat, he did so by making clear his anger towards Bartomeu, in an explosive interview with Goal.

“He didn’t end up keeping his word”, said Messi, who added: “It has been a long time since there has been a project or anything at all. They are always juggling and plugging gaps.”

Victor Font and Joan Laporta are among the candidates expected to run to be Bartomeu’s successor.

Font has attached his campaign to the appointment of former Barcelona midfielder Xavi Hernandez as coach while Laporta was previously president during the golden era under Pep Guardiola.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/lp0fpc/article32958840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BARTOMEU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/barcelona-president-bartomeu-resigns-after-messi-row/article32958841.ece
376,2020/10/28,Champions League | Felix brace gives Atletico Madrid vital win,"Marcos Llorente had put Atletico ahead in the first half, but goals from Dominik Szoboszlai and Mergim Berisha swung the fixture in the favour of the visitors early in the second half.

Joao Felix bagged a brace for Atletico Madrid as they survived a scare to complete a 3-2 Champions League Group A victory over Red Bull Salzburg and kick-start their European campaign at the Wanda Metropolitano stadium on Tuesday.

Marcos Llorente had put Atletico ahead in the first half, but goals from Dominik Szoboszlai and Mergim Berisha swung the fixture in the favour of the visitors early in the second half.

But the excellent Felix regained the initiative for his side with an equaliser, before firing in the winner with five minutes to play, going some way to erasing the memory of the 4-0 loss to champions Bayern Munich in their pool opener.

Bayern head the table with a full haul of six points after two rounds, followed by Atletico on three, and Lokomotiv Moscow and Salzburg with one each.

Felix's audacious over-head kick inside 15 minutes almost provided an early moment to remember, but his acrobatic effort crashed against the crossbar and away to safety.

Atletico did have the lead before the half-hour mark as Llorente picked up the ball 25 yards from goal and drilled the ball low past Salzburg goalkeeper Cican Stankovic, who will feel he should done better.

Llorente should have doubled the advantage shortly afterwards when he found himself one-on-one with Stankovic, but it was Salzburg who scored next.

Some sloppy play in midfield turned over possession and the ball eventually reached Szoboszlai, who thrashed his shot past home goalkeeper Jan Oblak.

Salzburg made a lightning start to the second half and were ahead inside a minute as Andreas Ulmers cross was turned home at the back post by Berisha.

But that lead was short-lived as Felix finished a sweeping Atletico move that left him with a tap-in to equalise, before lashing in the winner as the Salzburg defence stood static following a low cross into the box.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/q17h5i/article32959135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JOAOFELIX,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/champions-league-felix-brace-gives-atletico-madrid-vital-win/article32959136.ece
377,2020/10/28,Kimmich strike maintains Bayern Munich’s record run in Europe,"After Leon Goretzka gave Bayern an early lead in Russia, Lokomotiv deservedly equalised when midfielder Anton Miranchuk finished off a counter-attack on 70 minutes.

Joshua Kimmich’s second-half winner secured a record 13th straight Champions League victory for holders Bayern Munich on Tuesday as they held off a plucky challenge to triumph 2-1 at Lokomotiv Moscow.

After Leon Goretzka gave Bayern an early lead in Russia, Lokomotiv deservedly equalised when midfielder Anton Miranchuk finished off a counter-attack on 70 minutes.

However, Germany midfielder Kimmich made sure Bayern stayed top of their group when he turned just outside the area and fired a superb strike into the bottom corner on 79 minutes.

Lokomotiv squandered an early golden chance when forward Fyodor Smolov headed straight to Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at point-blank range.

Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski shot wide before the European champions took the lead with a goal created by France internationals Corentin Tolisso and Benjamin Pavard.

Midfielder Tolisso passed across the penalty area to Pavard, who deftly volleyed the ball with the inside of his boot.

Goretzka was waiting to expertly head inside the near post on 13 minutes.

Bayern’s French pair linked up to great effect again to set up a chance for Kingsley Coman, who hit the post on 25 minutes.

However, Lokomotiv started to find space to exploit down the flanks, with Smolov and left-back Maciej Rybus forcing Neuer into saves at the end of the first half.

Bayern head coach Hansi Flick made a double substitution at the start of the second half with Germany winger Serge Gnabry — making his first appearance since recovering from coronavirus -- and Javi Martinez introduced.

Bayern came within centimetres of a second goal just before the hour mark when Gnabry fired in a quick cross, but Kimmich’s shot clipped the boot of Lokomotiv centre-back Slobodan Rajkovic and goalkeeper Guilherme gratefully gathered the loose ball.

At the other end, only a good challenge from David Alaba prevented Moscow’s Cape Verde striker Ze Luis finishing a counter-attack.

When Lewandowski went down in the area on 65 minutes, referee Istvan Kovacs pointed to the spot, but the decision was overturned when the VAR spotted an offside in build-up.

Lokomotiv grabbed the deserved equaliser when Ze Luis burst free down the right and squared to Miranchuk who turned home.

Kimmich settled any nerves in the Bayern ranks when he received the ball outside the penalty area, needing one touch to control and drive home.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/l11du2/article32958829.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RUSSIASOCCERCHAMPIONSLEAGUE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/kimmich-strike-maintains-bayern-munichs-record-run-in-europe/article32958830.ece

380,2020/10/28,CITU seeks payment of wage arrears to sanitation workers,"‘They have not been paid for the last three months’

Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) city president R.K.S.V. Kumar has demanded immediate payment of the wage arrears of sanitation workers, involved in the segregation of dry and wet wastes.

A protest was staged by the workers, under the auspices of GVMC Contract Workers Union, affiliated to the CITU, opposite the GVMC Zone-II Office at Asilametta on Tuesday.

Addressing the gathering, Mr. Kumar said that it was unfortunate that the sanitation workers, who were working for cause of the public, putting their own lives at risk during the pandemic situation, had not been paid their wages for the past three months. The GVMC has even failed them to provide the tools required for their work, he said.

The growing population of the city and the resultant increase in work, was causing heavy burden on the workers. There was no recruitment of new workers and the vacancies, arising due to death or other reasons, were not being filled. Despite being recognised as 'frontline COVID-19 warriors', the GVMC officials were neglecting the welfare of the sanitation workers, he alleged.

The CITU leader called upon the workers to be prepared for a strike from November 2, if their wage arrears were not paid by then.

Zonal Commissioner Srinivas, who met the striking workers, told them that he would take the issue to the notice of the GVMC Commissioner and strive for a solution.

382,2020/10/28,Social distancing norms given the go-by in buses and trains,"Return journey to city after Dasara a nightmare, say commuters

Social distancing has gone for a toss in several RTC buses and trains as people return to Visakhapatnam after Dasara. Many passengers reveal that their return journey to the city after the festival was a nightmare as passengers have even ignored the mandatory rule of wearing masks.

While many bus conductors followed COVID-19 safety protocols by making sure the vehicle is not overcrowded, several inter-district buses plying in Visakhapatnam region were seen jam-packed. There were heated arguments between passengers in a few buses over occupying seats and not wearing masks.

“When I boarded the bus at Palasa RTC complex, the conductor made sure that passengers without reservation do not board the bus. However, when the bus crossed Srikakulam, the vehicle was overcrowded and the conductor was helpless. Passengers were moving without masks. When some people made sure that the middle seat is vacant to ensure social distancing, other passengers entered into heated arguments to allow them to sit,” said G. Ramesh Kumar, a resident of Palasa, who boarded a bus from Palasa to Visakhapatnam.

Several Pallevelugu and city buses in Visakhapatnam, Anakapalle, Chodavaram, Sabbavaram, Vizianagaram, Simhachalam and a few others totally ignored the safety protocol by allowing a huge number of passengers. “We cannot ask people to just leave when they try to board a bus with children and elderly persons. However we insist them to wear masks for sure. No matter how much you try, buses plying in some routes between Visakhapatnam and Ichchapuram, are always overcrowded, which we cannot avoid,” said a bus conductor from Visakhapatnam.

According to a few passengers, unlike last year, passengers with reservations were allowed to board trains as part of COVID-19 safety protocol. This reportedly led to overcrowding in RTC buses. Routes from Visakhapatnam to Srikakulam and East Godavari districts witnessed heavy rush since last week.

Meanwhile, some train commuters complained that some people are not wearing masks. There should be inspections and fines must be collected, said P.

383,2020/10/28,"‘I am a pretty unfiltered person’: Tahira Kashyap Khurrana on her latest book, 'The 12 Commandments of Being a Woman'","They have all kinds of flaws but you simply must love your in-laws, says author and filmmaker Tahira Kashyap Khurrana whose latest book is filled with outrageously candid revelations

About 12 years ago, just before Tahira Kashyap was to tie the knot, her mother-in-law to-be gave her a present. It was a gift the older woman had travelled from Chandigarh to Delhi to buy and wanted Tahira to wear on her wedding day. The gift was a “pair of bright red lacy bra and panties, another set of the same colour in satin, and one lonely thong”, the author and filmmaker writes in her latest book, The 12 Commandments of Being a Woman. “My mother-in-law had high expectations of me. She gave me a size 38D, and here I was struggling to fill a 34, that too with pads,” she says, laughing at the memory.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

Family fodder

The book of essays — that could easily pass off as a memoir — is full of funny and relatable anecdotes from Tahira’s life. She writes about everything: from ‘feeling like a freak’ as a 13-year-old to peeing in her pants after winning a trophy, to getting a Brazilian and an unplanned pregnancy. There’s no detail too personal. “I am a pretty unfiltered person. I wanted to write everything down and it was very empowering to just let go. I might have given my family members some anxiety when they read the book because nothing has been edited,” she shares on a phone call from her in-law’s home in Chandigarh where she’s been staying during the lockdown. “These days, all conversations around our living room suddenly stop when I enter. I think my family doesn’t want to give me more material for any future books,” she laughs.

Of all the family members, obviously the reactions of her husband Ayushmann Khurrana, whom she calls ‘her skinnier half’ mattered the most. “He is the first person to read everything I write. When he was reading my book, I kept looking at him to gauge his reaction. I saw him grimace and grin, and his eyebrows would go up. The one response I consistently got from him was, ‘Are you serious? I thought this stuff was only for the two of us to know’.” Ayushmann’s reactions are quite understandable, considering Tahira’s candour while writing about their relationship that started in school, their early days of marriage, and her struggles to forge an identity of her own now that he is a bonafide movie star. “I thought I was the only one struggling with this, but I realised that as women, most of us become the Earth and the Sun is someone else. Our lives are spent revolving around that person. It is not like Ayushmann asked me to do that; it was something that I did subconsciously,” explains the 37-year-old.

Always a writer

It has taken a few detours for Tahira to finally find her calling. And it turned out to be the most obvious one. “I’ve been writing since I was five or six. I wrote the first play, Socha Na Tha, that our theatre group Manch Tantra performed. I also wrote a book [Cracking The Code: My Journey in Bollywood] with Ayushmann a few years ago,” she says, adding that 12 Commandments... is the third book she’s written on her own. Taking me through her first solo attempt at non-fiction writing, she adds, “There’s a lot of clarity when you are writing about things that happened in your own life, but it also needs a lot of courage. Now, when I am writing about my 13-year-old self who dragged her mother to a gynaecologist because she didn’t think she was a girl, I see the funny side of things. But when it happened, it was quite traumatising. Revisiting these intense moments took an emotional toll.”

The second chapter, where she writes about not being allowed to participate in extracurricular activities in school, is what Tahira picks as the toughest incident to revisit. “Every time I read or even talk about that period, I get all choked up.” Eventually, when she won an inter-school competition, she got so excited that she wet her pants. “That moment of glory meant so much to me. Nothing since has come close to that feeling.”

Paperback writer

Once she had committed to writing the book, it didn’t take Tahira very long to get it all on paper. It took her about four months to get the first draft to her editors. “This coincided with the lockdown. I would get up earlier than the rest of the household and take a corner on the dining table. I’d end up writing almost continuously for six to eight hours in that corner which meant that my family couldn’t eat there. I did this in different spaces around the house and everyone had to adjust.” It has been a good year for Tahira, with her short film Pinni, starring Neena Gupta, releasing as part of an anthology, Zindagi inShort, on Flipkart Video. And she’s already busy with her next very hush-hush project.

When she isn’t working, Tahira is keeping the kids busy with painting and craft sessions, and bonding with her in-laws. As she writes in her book, ‘They come in all shapes and sizes, and have all kinds of flaws but you simply must love your in-laws.’

384,2020/10/28,"Daniel Menaker, award-winning author and editor, dead at 79","Daniel Menaker, an award-winning author of fiction and nonfiction and a longtime editor at The New Yorker and Random House who worked with Alice Munro, Salman Rushdie, Colum McCann and many others, has died at age 79.

Menaker’s son, podcaster Will Menaker, announced on Twitter that he died on Monday of pancreatic cancer, with his wife, the writer and editor Katherine Bouton; and his two children at his bed side.

“He was me, and I am him in so many ways,” Will Menaker tweeted. “I miss him terribly, but am struck with a profound feeling that I am the luckiest man alive for having been his son.”

Daniel Menaker was the author of several books, including the memoir My Mistake and the comic psychological novel The Treatment, adapted into a 2007 movie starring Chris Eigeman and Ian Holm.

He was also known for the O. Henry Award-winning title story of his collection The Old Left, which draws on his early childhood in Greenwich Village and his red diaper upbringing. His father allegedly spied on Trotsky in Mexico, where the exiled Russian revolutionary was eventually assassinated, on behalf of the Communist Party; an uncle was named for Friedrich Engels.

In conversation, Menaker was often genial and self-effacing, but he would acknowledge competitive and boastful sides and was haunted by a family tragedy he helped bring on.

In 1967, during a family game of touch football, he encouraged his older and only brother Mike to play defense, even though Mike was troubled by bad knees. Mike Menaker tore a ligament and died after surgery when he developed septicemia.

“Somewhere in my hideous id, I killed him,” Menaker wrote in his memoir. I vanquished him from the field, and spoils are all mine.

Menaker was an undergraduate at Swarthmore and received a master’s degree at Johns Hopkins University.

He taught at private school and worked as an editorial assistant at the Prentice Hall publishing house before joining The New Yorker as a fact checker in 1969.

He remained for more than 25 years, rising from fact checker to editor, handling work by Munro, Pauline Kael and George Saunders among others.

He was also published in the magazine, starting with a story in which he imagines his brother returning from the dead, Grief.

In his memoir, he remembered being pushed out of the magazine in the mid-1990s by then-editor Tina Brown and handed off to her husband, Harry Evans, who was running Random House and made Menaker a senior editor.

Over the next decade, his authors included Rushdie and such future prize winners as McCann and Elizabeth Strout.

He also took on one of publishing’s more unusual assignments — the manuscript for the novel about Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential run Primary Colors, which he edited without knowing who wrote it.

The 1996 bestseller was released anonymously, although the author was eventually revealed to be journalist Joe Klein.

“It reinforced the education I got at Swarthmore, which was very much explicative. You didn’t care who wrote a poem, you just read it,” Menaker told the Paris Review in 2014. “I’m not sure that Primary Colors is a great work of art. I do know that it’s an awfully good novel, and it was a pleasure to have all the author complications cut away. So that was a sort of purist, graduate-school approach to something that was a commercial publication, but it was great fun.”

He was forced out from Random House in 2007 — his salary was too high, his profits too low, he would recall — and in recent years worked as a consultant for Barnes & Noble and on the faculty for the creative writing program at SUNY: Stony Brook University.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/daniel-menaker-award-winning-author-and-editor-dead-at-79/article32960075.ece
385,2020/10/28,IIT-Jodhpur develops transistors with biodegradable gelatin as electrical insulator,"Breakthrough in ‘green electronics’ may be used as a breath analyser

In a breakthrough towards “green electronics”, researchers at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Jodhpur, have developed transistors with biodegradable gelatin as an electrical insulator, which may be utilised as breath analyser. The changes in the property of transmitting electric force by exposure to moisture will enable the device to measure respiratory rate.

IIT’s Flexible Large Area Microelectronics (FLAME) research group, headed by Professor Shree Prakash Tiwari, has used the natural protein gelatin, with a unique amino acid profile, for the fabrication of high-performance organic field-effect transistors. The FLAME group has been working in the field of green technologies for organic and flexible electronics for several years.

Research scholar Vivek Raghuwanshi, a member of the FLAME group, said on Tuesday that the transistor devices, along with the circuit applications, were capable of monitoring health indicators in real time and could be used as breath rate analyser, which was still an evolving area. The work has been published recently in the American Chemical Society’s Applied Electronic Materials journal.

The FLAME group, comprising researchers mostly from IIT-Jodhpur’s Electrical Engineering Department, has also worked for the development of organic semiconductors on unconventional substrates, such as paper. “The transistors on paper showed a remarkable stability in ambient mode for more than six months,” Mr. Raghuwanshi said.

The gelatin transistors reacted quickly with rapid response and recovery time under the humidity exposure test and acted as an effective sensor, on the basis of which they can be used as prototypes of human health and breath analysers.

The GLC being an SUV is better suited to rough roads and rural areas, but overall, the C-class is better as it offers more comfort and is a smoother and nicer car to drive. We take it that in Gujarat the roads are good, so if that is the case, go for the C-class.

388,2020/10/28,India’s air quality data for comparing annual pollution is patchy,"Only 15 States have PM2.5 monitoring systems for any year, shows an analysis of CPCB data.

The base data available for monitoring trends in air pollution from 2016-2019 is irregular in most of the States in which the 102 cities that have been targeted for improving air quality are situated. The was shown by an analysis of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)-data by Carbon Copy and Respirer Living Sciences, which are research and advocacy organisations working on analysing air pollution trends.

Only 15 States have PM(Particulate Matter)2.5 monitoring systems for any year. Only West Bengal has an above average number of readings available at 110 each for five monitors. Delhi ranks as the most polluted in PM2.5 average across all three years, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

Out of the 23 States listed in the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) only three States/Union Territories — Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab — accounted for above-average readings for all three years for PM10 monitoring.

Jharkhand was at the bottom of the chart with only 64 average readings per monitor, with three monitors accounted for in the State.

The NCAP envisages reducing air pollution levels by 20%-30% in 102 cities by 2024, based on 2017 levels of PM2.5 and PM10. Until 2018, the standard way cities measured pollution was the manual method in which readings from monitoring stations were compiled twice a week, for 52 weeks. Ideally, all of the cities ought to have 104 readings, from every monitor, every year, but this was rarely the case, and this data discrepancy would affect accurate comparison of year-wise changes in pollution levels. There is also a wide variation in the number of monitors in cities. After 2018, cities have begun moving to automated systems that continuously track and report pollution levels.

“While everyone relies on continuous monitoring of data, the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Standards (CAAQMS) is a relatively new monitoring network, so if you want to compare levels in 2022 with those in 2018, there might not be enough data to do so,” said Santosh Harish, Fellow, Centre for Policy Research. “Tracking annual average concentrations provides an objective way to verify whether air quality levels have improved or not.”

59 out of 122 cities had no PM2.5 data available at all. Where data was available, Noida ranked the worst with an average PM2.5 reading of 119, followed by Agra, Delhi, Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Muzzaffarpur, Kanpur, Chandigarh, Howrah and Kolkata. Varanasi missed the top 10 by one spot, ranking a close 11th.

The NAMP (National Air Quality Monitoring Programme) has been running since 1984. However, the publicly reported data on the CPCB website is only available since 2016 till October 2019. India has a network of 793 NAAQS stations covering 344 cities/towns in 29 States and six Union Territories. Under NAMP, four pollutants — Sulphur dioxide (So2), Nitrogen dioxide (No2), suspended particulate matter (SPM), and respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) have been identified as key pollutants for regular monitoring.

The monitoring is being carried out by State Pollution Control Boards and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Nagpur, and overseen by Pollution Control Committees, the CPCB, and now by the Union Environment Ministry under the NCAP.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/i59s8q/article30085932.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THPOLLUTIONINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/indias-air-quality-data-for-comparing-annual-pollution-is-patchy/article32964922.ece
389,2020/10/28,Antarctica yields fossils of giant birds with 21-foot wingspans,"The pelagornithids lived until about 2.5 million years ago

Scientists have identified the fossil of a giant bird that lived about 50 million years ago, with wingspans of up to 21 feet that would dwarf today’s largest bird, the wandering albatross.

The fossils recovered from Antarctica in the 1980s represent the oldest giant members of an extinct group of birds that patrolled the southern oceans.

By comparison, today’s largest bird, the wandering albatross has a wingspan of 11 and-a-half-foot.

Called Pelagornithids, the birds filled a niche much like that of today’s albatrosses and travelled widely over Earth’s oceans for at least 60 million years.

Though a much smaller pelagornithid fossil dates from 62 million years ago, one of the newly described fossils — a 50 million-year-old portion of a bird’s foot — shows that the larger pelagornithids arose just after life rebounded from the mass extinction 65 million years ago, when the relatives of birds, the dinosaurs, went extinct.

This five-inch segment of fossilized jaw, which was discovered in Antarctica in the 1980s, dates from 40 million years ago. The skull of the bird would have been about two feet long, while the pseudoteeth, which were originally covered with horny keratin, would have been up to an inch long. At this scale, the bird’s wingspan would have been 5 to 6 meters, or some 20 feet. | Photo Credit: UC Berkeley image courtesy of Peter Kloess

A second pelagornithid fossil, part of a jaw bone, dates from about 40 million years ago, according to the study published in the journal Scientific Reports.

“Our fossil discovery, with its estimate of a 5-to-6-metre wingspan — nearly 20 feet — shows that birds evolved to a truly gigantic size relatively quickly after the extinction of the dinosaurs and ruled over the oceans for millions of years,” said Peter Kloess, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley in the U.S.

The last known pelagornithid is from 2.5 million years ago, a time of changing climate as Earth cooled, and the ice ages began, they said. Pelagornithids are known as ‘bony-toothed’ birds because of the bony projections, or struts, on their jaws that resemble sharp-pointed teeth, though they are not true teeth, like those of humans and other mammals.

The bony protrusions were covered by a horny material, keratin, which is like our fingernails, the researchers said. Called pseudoteeth, the struts helped the birds snag squid and fish from the sea as they soared for perhaps weeks at a time over much of Earth’s oceans, they said.

Large flying animals have periodically appeared on Earth, starting with the pterosaurs that flapped their leathery wings during the dinosaur era and reached wingspans of 33 feet, according to the researchers.

The pelagornithids came along to claim the wingspan record in the Cenozoic, after the mass extinction, and lived until about 2.5 million years ago. Around that same time, teratorns, now extinct, ruled the skies, they said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/l09r1w/article32963048.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pelagornithid750px,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/antarctica-yields-fossils-of-giant-birds-with-21-foot-wingspans/article32963050.ece
390,2020/10/28,Only 366 North Atlantic right whales remain: NOAA,"The whales have struggled with poor reproduction and high mortality over the last decade

The population of North Atlantic right whales, an endangered species that has been the focus of conservation efforts for decades, has dipped to less than 370, officials said.

The whale numbers at only 366, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday in an estimate that reflects the population as of January 2019. The previous estimate, which reflected January 2018, was 412.

The whales have struggled with poor reproduction and high mortality over the last decade, especially the past few years. They are vulnerable to ship collisions and entanglement in fishing gear.

The population was more than 480 in 2011, the Portland Press Herald reported. A NOAA team is working on a plan designed to reduce the risk the whales face due to fishing gear.

Conservation groups sounded the alarm about the drop in population Monday. Erica Fuller, an attorney with Conservation Law Foundation, said “the outlook is grim if we do not act today.”

The population of North Atlantic right whales was devastated during the commercial whaling era.

391,2020/10/28,Ice loss to add 0.4 degrees Celsius to global temperatures: study,"Ice loss from the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets is accelerating and already outstripping what scientists until recently believed to be the worst-case melt scenarios.

The loss of billions of tonnes of ice from Earth’s frozen spaces is likely to increase global temperatures by an additional 0.4 degrees Celsius, according to research Tuesday highlighting the danger of a “vicious circle” of warming.

Arctic summer sea ice levels have declined by more than 10% each decade since the late 1970s and mountain glaciers have shed roughly 250 billion tonnes of ice annually over the last century.

Also Read | Record melt: Greenland lost 586 billion tonnes of ice in 2019

Ice loss from the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets is accelerating and already outstripping what scientists until recently believed to be the worst-case melt scenarios.

Decades of studies have sought to quantify how Earth’s melting ice will contribute to sea level rise — Antarctica and Greenland alone contain enough frozen water to boost oceans’ height by around 60 metres.

But little research has tried to predict how ice loss will add to the already 1.0 degree C of global warming emissions from fossil fuels since the start of the Industrial Era.

Scientists at Germany’s Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) used a climate model that includes components on atmosphere, ocean, sea- and land-ice data to predict temperature change from ice loss under a variety of emissions scenarios.

Also Read | Study sounds the alarm for Arctic ice

They found that under current levels of atmospheric CO2 — roughly 400 parts per million — the melting of Arctic sea ice, mountain glaciers and the polar ice caps would raise temperatures by 0.4C.

That’s on top of the 1.5C of warming our current emissions levels have rendered all but inevitable, and the safer cap on global warming aimed for in the Paris climate accord.

The main driver of temperature gain from ice loss would be due to a process known as albedo feedback, in which heat reflective bright ice is replaced by absorbant darker sea water and/or soil.

“If global ice masses shrink, this changes how much of the sunlight that hits the Earth’s surface is reflected back into space,” said lead author Nico Wunderling.

Also Read | 'Artificial snow' could save stricken Antarctic ice sheet, says study

He likened the albedo effect to wearing either white or black clothes in summer.

“If you wear dark, you heat up more easily,” Mr. Wunderling noted.

This is one of Earth’s so-called climate “feedback loops”, in which increased temperatures lead to further ice loss, which in turn further increases temperatures.

Tipping point

Other ways that temperatures would rise further as ice receded include increased water vapour in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effects, said authors of the study published in Nature Communications.

Looking solely at Arctic sea ice — which unlike polar ice caps might be totally absent during summer months within decades — they found its melt would contribute 0.2C to global temperatures alone.

The largest ice masses in Greenland and West Antarctica, by comparison, are huge and will likely take centuries to melt fully even if emissions continue their unabated growth.

But the authors highlighted the risk that those enormous bodies of frozen water could soon reach a point of no return as temperatures creep ever higher.

Given the unknowns surrounding ice cap tipping points, Mr. Wunderling told AFP it would be best to act in “a risk-averse” way and try to drag down emissions as soon as possible.

“With continued global warming, it becomes more and more likely that we cross tipping points -- not just in the ice-sheets, but also in other parts of the climate system,” he said.

“If the Paris Agreement is fulfilled we can avoid many of the strongest and potentially irreversible impacts on Earth’s ice masses, the global climate and humanity.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/x8uczz/article32958817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CLIMATE-CHANGEARCTICSHIPPINGINSURANCE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/ice-loss-to-add-04-degrees-celsius-to-global-temperatures-study/article32958818.ece
392,2020/10/28,No room for complacency; CSIR chief,"In a communication to all CISR labs across the country, the DG cautioned against people congregating in one place and ensure the homes are as ventilated as possible.

“The only proven way to control the pandemic across the world is following some simple precautions of wearing face masks, personal hygiene and social distancing, particularly during these festival times. A lot of ground has been covered in the last 10 months and understanding has begun to emerge leading to new therapies, diagnostics and vaccines about COVID-19 yet, there is still far more to uncover,” said Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Director General Shekhar C. Mande on Wednesday.

In a communication to all CISR labs across the country, the DG cautioned against people congregating in one place and ensure the homes are as ventilated as possible. “During these festive times we usually witness large gatherings, family reunions, and celebrations. However, this virus has continued to ravage the world, spread wilder than the wild fire, and has disrupted every sphere of human activity. With ‘unlock’ and more activities resuming, it is easy to forget the virus and jump into the festivities and celebrate which we all love to do,” he said.

However, people should consider the workload on doctors and healthcare workers working relentlessly to ensure that affected individuals get the best care. “Festival is the time to pay respect to them by making sure that we don’t enhance the burden on them by overlooking the safety measures of containing the spread of the virus,” said Dr. Mande.

Indian scientists have been involved in “exciting developments” such as new diagnostic kits like FELUDA developed at CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology; launch of Favipiravir by Cipla with CSIR technology while findings about treating diseases from the age-old traditional knowledge of the Indian system are expected soon as also vaccines development. “But, there is a still more to learn as there are many perplexing observations about the pandemic,” said the DG.

“Why are some asymptomatic and recover on their own without any symptom? It is not that people below 65 years are not affected and people without diabetes are safe as even those without these co-morbidities have the possibility of developing severe form of the disease. It clearly establishes the fact that we know little about the virus and the severity that it will hit with any one who comes in contact with the virus,” he warned.

Thus, “it will only be befitting tribute to countless corona warriors if we truly observe discipline during the festival season and not lead to explosion of the pandemic because of our complacence,” added the DG.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/no-room-for-complacency-csir-chief/article32966854.ece

394,2020/10/28,Is sleep anti-evolutionary?,"No, says Dr Abhinav Singh, a sleep medicine expert, even though we spend a third of our lives in a state where, in hunter-gatherer times, survival could have been at stake. Here’s why sleep is therapy

It may seem like sleep is a mistake because we spend about a third of our lives in a state in which our pre-agrarian ancestors could have been attacked and killed by animals. But “evolution does not make mistakes,” says Dr Abhinav Singh, the facility director at the Indiana Sleep Center, US.

Humans, however, disrupted sleep with the invention of light bulbs, industrialisation, and becoming an always-on culture, where responding to emails at 2 am is celebrated. It’s only over the past couple of decades that sleep has become a subject to study, a matter to take seriously, because we’ve understood the perils of not getting enough.

“We are all solar animals, designed to be charged by the sun, and to recuperate at night,” says Dr Singh. This means that our bodies are governed by circadian rhythm: waking with the rise of the sun, drumming down activity with the setting of the sun, and sleeping as darkness descends. “Every cell of our body responds to wake-sleep mode. Every living being — plants and animals too — have a rest and activity cycle,” he says. Each organ needs sleep to repair, restore, rejuvenate, and refresh itself, body and mind.

Here, Dr Singh tells us how to get a good night’s rest.

Determine your ‘sleep number’. The number of hours you need to sleep is different for everyone. “If you allow yourself to naturally fall asleep and wake up for about two weeks — without alarms and extra screen exposure in the evening — you will realise what your number is,” says Dr Singh. Adults usually fall in the seven-to-nine hour range. Six hours or less has been shown to have deficits of all kinds: cognitive, memory, mood issues, forgetfulness.

Skip the calories after sundown. “Any calories eaten after sunset is going to be troublesome, particularly applicable for calorie dense meals after dark,” he says, adding that if you sleep poorly your signals to eat more are higher because the body feels that it is under threat of survival. Eating fibre-rich foods like fruit and nuts can help cut back on calories at night. Definitely skip fatty, sugar-filled, packaged foods, and alcohol. “Alcohol acts in the same place as Valium does in the brain. It may help you feel a little drowsy, but in the second half of the night, the breakdown products of alcohol act like darts into the brain. It is disruptive and reduces the brain’s ability to get into deep sleep. One glass of wine three hours before sleeping is okay.”

Switch off screens at sundown. Or at the very least, an hour before bedtime. Any kind of light — even if you have a blue light filter — sends a signal of wakefulness to the brain, delaying sleep onset. Convert your night relaxation into something you can listen to: an audio book or gentle music, for instance.

Set the scene. “Let sleep come to you, rather than chasing it,” says Dr Singh, describing sleep as a butterfly — it wil come to you if you keep your body and mind very still. Cue darkness, quietude, an environment where you feel cool enough to feel the need for a sheet. “Cold temperatures help your body release melatonin. It helps your surface temperature rise. As the blood vessels dilate, they lose heat and your core cools down,” he says, describing how sleep comes on.

Remember ‘sleep foreplay’. About 90 minutes before you sleep make sure you’ve dealt with all that you need to, in terms of work and chores, and begin to wind down. Then take a shower, journal for about 15 minutes, plan for the next day, read, breathe, and focus on your breath.

Take mid-afternoon naps. Somewhere between the hours of noon and 3 pm, we feel a lull in alertness. “You can’t keep your engine running at full throttle for 16 hours, so nature has planted this,” says Dr Singh, who advises a shut-eye for 20 to 25 minutes, whether you sleep or not. “The sugar and caffeine cravings go away. If you’re a parent and need to fragment your sleep into say six hours at night and two hours in the daytime, do so for a year or so, but try to get out of the cycle as soon as possible.”

Check with your doctor if you’re snoring. It could be sleep apnoea and means you’re losing breath. “Have it evaluated especially if you have a dry mouth, feel sleepy during the day, or drink lots of caffeine to stay awake,” says Dr Singh.

Use props. If you need an app like Calm or Headspace, go for it. Avoid apps that are asking you to interact and engage. There’s no harm using white noise or pink noise machines either. If you feel essential oils like lavender helps you, try it as long as it doesn’t cause an allergy, though there’s no large-scale scientific research to support this.

Understand why productivity at work and sleep are linked. A rested employee takes less time to finish a task and makes fewer errors than someone who is sleep deprived, making the system more efficient. Dr Singh talks of absenteeism, where the employee may take more leave because of problems resulting from poor sleep. He says presenteeism is worse, when the person is physically present but absent mentally, often tired and caffeinated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/9df3cv/article32963724.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-1175223579-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/is-sleep-anti-evolutionary/article32963725.ece

This is the first launch by the Indian Space Research Organisation since the COVID-19-induced lockdown came into force in March.

ISRO chairman K. Sivan said in June that 10 space missions being prepared for launch in 2020 have been “disturbed” due to the lockdown.

EOS-01 is intended for applications in agriculture, forestry and disaster management support, ISRO said. “The launch is tentatively scheduled at 3.02 p.m. IST on November 7 subject to weather conditions” from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at Sriharikota, it said in a statement.

The customer satellites are being launched under commercial agreement with NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), Department of Space, the space agency said, without giving further details.

This will be the 51st mission of ISRO’s workhorse, the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.

In view of the strict COVID-19 pandemic norms in place at the launch centre, gathering of media personnel there was not planned and the viewing gallery will be closed, ISRO said. However, the live telecast of the launch will be available on ISRO website, Youtube, Facebook and Twitter channels, it added.

Speaking to PTI in June, Dr. Sivan said ISRO will make an assessment of the impact of the lockdown on its missions. “Because of this (pandemic), everything got disturbed.

396,2020/10/28,Coronavirus | Ban on public events can bring down COVID-19 transmission rate by 24%: study,"“We found that combining different measures showed the greatest effect on reducing the transmission of COVID-19. As we experience a resurgence of the virus, policymakers will need to consider combinations of measures to reduce the R number,” said Professor Harish Nair from the University of Edinburgh, U.K.

Ban on public events can bring down the COVID-19 reproduction number (R) number — a key measure of virus transmission — by 24% in less than a month, according to a modelling study published in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

An R value above 1 indicates a growing outbreak, whereas an R value below 1 indicates a shrinking outbreak.

The research using data from 131 countries suggests that individual measures, including closure of schools and workplaces, ban on public events and gatherings of more than ten people, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits, are associated with a reduction in transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, combined measures are more effective at reducing transmission, the researchers said.

Combinations of measures

“We found that combining different measures showed the greatest effect on reducing the transmission of COVID-19. As we experience a resurgence of the virus, policymakers will need to consider combinations of measures to reduce the R number,” said Professor Harish Nair from the University of Edinburgh, U.K.

“Our study can inform decisions on which measures to introduce or lift, and when to expect to see their effects, but this will also depend on the local context — the R number at any given time, the local healthcare capacity, and the social and economic impact of measures,” Nair said.

When looking at the measures individually, a ban on public events was associated with the greatest reduction in R — 24 % reduction after 28 days — which the researchers suggest may be because they are likely to prevent super spreader events and it was often the first measure to be introduced in countries.

The measures most strongly associated with an increase in R were lifting bans on gatherings of more than ten people and re-opening of schools, according to the researchers.

Although reopening schools was associated with a 24% increase in the R by day 28, the researchers caution that they were unable to account for different precautions some countries implemented for reopening schools, for example limiting class sizes, distancing measure, routine deep cleaning, personal handwashing, face masks, and thermal temperature checks on arrival. They said these are essential for safer school reopening and should be taken into account when interpreting this finding.

“We found an increase in R after reopening schools but is not clear whether the increase is attributable to specific age groups, where there may be substantial differences in adherence to social distancing measures within and outside classrooms,” Nair added. “Furthermore, more data are needed to understand the specific role of schools in increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission through robust contact tracing.”

The study, however, does not account for other potentially influential factors that have an impact on R — including, among other things, compliance with the interventions, changes in population behaviour, sub-national differences in R, or the effects of contact tracing and isolation — all of which vary by context.

Using the R number as a proxy for transmission also has limitations, as it is difficult to estimate accurately, particularly when prevalence is low, the researchers said.

In this modelling study, data on daily country-level estimates of R were linked with data on what measures those countries had in place from January 1, 2020 to July 20, 2020. The timeline of each country was divided into individual phases when all measures remained the same in that country. The analysis included 790 phases from 131 countries and the authors used a model to measure the association between which measures were in place and changes in the R.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/x1s3yx/article32961618.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVID19CORONAVIRUS1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ban-on-public-events-can-bring-down-covid-19-transmission-rate-by-24-study/article32961619.ece
397,2020/10/28,"Now, a satellite system to combat space collisions","A full system of 12 satellites is expected in 2024, said NorthStar co-founder Stewart Bain in interview

Canada's NorthStar Earth & Space and Thales Alenia Space said on Tuesday they will begin work on a commercial satellite system to combat the threat of collisions in space.

NorthStar, an information service company, said it has contracted Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between France's Thales and Italy's Leonardo, to build the first three satellites of its “Skylark” constellation.

Montreal-based NorthStar said the constellation would be the first commercial service to monitor objects like satellites in space from space, where they can be tracked more precisely than from Earth.

Seattle-based LeoStella LLC will oversee the final assembly of the satellites, which are expected to launch in 2022. A full system of 12 satellites is expected in 2024, said NorthStar co-founder Stewart Bain in interview.

“We are deliberately international because this is an international problem,” Bain said.

While the United States and other governments already collect such data, demand for near real-time information that is commercially available is growing rapidly as experts forecast a “new space” economy worth over $1 trillion a year.

Data from the constellation could be used by groups from insurance companies to commercial satellite operators, Bain said.

The 2009 collision between a spacecraft operated by U.S. communications group Iridium Satellite LLC and a Russian Cosmos-2251 military satellite sent at least 600 pieces of debris off into space and raised fears that other satellites could be struck and damaged.

More recently, some researchers suggested in May that countries should levy an “orbit congestion charge” on satellite operators to tackle the growing concentration of space junk like debris, although others doubted the practicalities of such a fee.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/xqao46/article32961081.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NorthStarEarthSpaceIncNorthStarBuildingWorldsFirstSa,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/now-a-satellite-system-to-combat-space-collisions/article32961082.ece
