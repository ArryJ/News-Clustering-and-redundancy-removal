0,2020/10/03,"NBA Finals | James-Davis duo comes to the party, again","Combine for 65 points as Lakers take a 2-0 lead over Miami Heat

LeBron James and Anthony Davis delivered a fearsome one-two punch for Los Angeles on Friday, sparking more memories of Lakers legends Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant.

James and Davis combined for 65 points in the Lakers’ 124-114 victory over the Heat, which put Los Angeles halfway to victory in the best-of-seven championship series.

They are the first Lakers duo to score 60 points in a Finals game since O’Neal and Bryant achieved the feat in 2002 — when it claimed a third straight title.

After O’Neal departed the Lakers — his relationship with Bryant famously soured — Bryant won two more titles with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010.

James, playing in his 10th title series and with championships with Miami and Cleveland on his resume, recalled watching the Kobe-Shaq pairing when he was a High School star.

“Obviously we knew the force that Shaq brought to the table, but the elegance and force that Kobe played with, as well,” James said.

“To be in the conversation with those two guys, myself and AD — is just very humbling, because I know I grew up watching those guys.”

Lakers wore their Bryant-inspired Black Mamba kit on Friday and remained unbeaten in four playoff games when wearing it.

James said that his and Davis’s roles in the team can’t be precisely compared to those of Shaq and Kobe.

The result: Heat 114 (Butler 25, Olynyk 24) lost to Lakers 124 (James 33, Davis 32).

1,2020/10/03,"Name, place, letter-writer","And bloody fool what he has put on one form? Bathroomootham

Respected Madam/Sir,

Two-three days back suddenly one question is coming to the brain like anything. It is coming into brain as if Chinese army and refusing to go. I tried all techniques to make idea go. I read one novel. I saw one DVD. I even put one evening of rummy with Mrs. Mathrubootham.

Whether idea is going out of the head? Never. Finally, I told Mrs. Mathrubootham, Kamalam one idea is coming in the head and it is not going only. What to do?

She said, old man go to the kitchen and take two-three plate and hit them like anything. If Corona can go means idea can also go. I said, Kamalam, this is a serious matter.

She said first of all, is it some adults-only idea? Because then you please discuss privately and don’t put in newspaper letter and all. Last week only my cousin Katherine from Jamshedpur called and asked whether our Mathrubootham is world-famous Hindu Letter Writer Mathrubootham. Immediately I denied like anything. Whole world is reading your letter. Please don’t cut my nose with matter-type letters.

I said, no no no Kamalam, thousand times no. What nonsense you are talking. Whether I am sitting whole day and thinking matter items only?

She looked at me. Then she looked at my phone. Then she looked at me. I looked out of the window. Suddenly one beautiful scenery is there, and it is there until Mrs. Mathrubootham is leaving the room.

Madam/ Sir, shall I tell you the idea? How many years I have been Mr. J. Mathrubootham? Whole life I am Mathrubootham only. School Mathrubootham. College Mathrubootham. Office Mathrubootham. Whole life I am Mathrubootham.

Whether it is boring like anything or no?

Well, for two-three months in college one comedy took place. My uncle from Palakkad, who is no more, is doing all my forms and all for college admission. And bloody fool what he has put on one form? Bathroomootham.

Madam/ Sir, you just imagine life of young man in college. Everyday during attendance professor is saying where is Bathroomootham? For two-three months torture like anything. Then I put 25,000 forms and begging and crying and falling at feet and finally college is changing name to correct spelling. But my cricket team football is still saying Bathroomootham for one year. Too much humiliation.

But same name for whole time is little boring? You agree no? Ok then tell me should I change name or no? What is there? No tension. Some two-three forms and newspaper ad and maybe I can have some good action name.

J. Macpherson? Ok, maybe sounds like British villain in freedom struggle movie.

How about J.R. Rahman? People will think I am brother and give VIP treatment? Maybe entire Indian police will harass nonstop.

Maybe some underworld don type name? Kattabomman? Madam/ Sir, just imagine when people are asking sir, what is your name and I say Kattabomman. Yappa!

I took one list of names to Mrs. Mathrubootham and said Kamalam, I am thinking of changing my name to something new and exciting. Any thoughts? She looked at me and said many thoughts are coming but cannot be said. Old man, name is like gas cylinder or what? You are changing every few weeks? What nonsense are you talking? Please don’t waste my time.

Best name is Kattabomman. It is giving thrilling hero feel. I like it. Madam/ Sir, today itself I am going to Google to see procedure for name change. Any suggestions from your end? If you say Kasturi and all, then it is useless.

Yours in nomenclature innovation,

2,2020/10/03,French Open | Djokovic advances with a slick win; Altmaier stuns Berrettini,"Tsitsipas and Dimitrov move up but end of the road for Agut and Wawrinka; Kenin in fourth round

Novak Djokovic maintained his imperious progress at the French Open with a 6-0, 6-3, 6-2 drubbing of Colombian Daniel Galan to move effortlessly into the last 16 on Saturday.

The 33-year-old was rarely extended by his 153rd-ranked opponent and even found time to help out with court sweeping duties when the match was interrupted by rain.

Novak Djokovic demolished Colombian lucky loser Daniel Galan to reach the Roland Garros last 16 for an 11th successive year on Saturday.

World No. 1 Djokovic swept past 153rd-ranked Galan 6-0, 6-3, 6-2 with his most challenging moment coming when he helped groundstaff lay more clay on the surface of Court Philippe Chatrier after rain had made it treacherous.

Earlier, German qualifier Daniel Altmaier, ranked 186th in the world, bundled out Italian seventh seed Matteo Berrettini from the French Open with a comprehensive 6-2, 7-6(5), 6-4 victory.

Making his debut at Roland Garros, the 22-year-old broke the off-colour Italian’s serve four times to win their first career meeting in two hours and 15 minutes on Court Philippe-Chatrier.

In the fourth round, Altmaier will meet US Open semifinalist and 17th seed Pablo Carreno Busta, who proved strong enough to beat compatriot and 10th seed Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4.

Two walkovers

Fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas advanced to the fourth round after his opponent Aljaz Bedene retired with an ankle injury while trailing 6-1, 6-2, 3-1.

The Greek will play Bulgarian 18th seed Grigor Dimitrov, who also went through when Roberto Carballes Baena of Spain pulled out after losing the first two sets 6-1, 6-3.

In the women’s section, American fourth seed Sofia Kenin stormed into the fourth round with a 6-2, 6-0 demolition of Romanian qualifier Irina Bara.

The Australian Open champion lost the first two games before turning on the power and winning the next 12 to reach the last 16 here for the second time.

The straightforward win was a big improvement on Kenin’s first two outings, when she needed three sets to progress. “It wasn’t as dramatic, which I’m quite happy about. I kind of was a little bit tired of those dramatic matches. I just wanted to just try to start off well and finish off really well,” said Kenin.

Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur, seeded 30th, became the first Arab woman to reach the fourth round at Roland Garros after producing a shock 7-6(7), 2-6, 6-3 win over eighth seed Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus.

Earlier this year, the former French Open junior champion had been the first Arab woman to reach a Grand Slam quarterfinal with her good show in Australia.

Russian 13th seed Andrey Rublev advanced with a straight-sets win over South African Kevin Anderson.

Nadal cruises

On Friday, defending champion Rafael Nadal fired an ominous warning with a ruthless 6-1, 6-4, 6-0 win over Italy’s Stefano Travaglia, while the 2015 winner Stan Wawrinka suffered a shock exit.

The three-time Slam winner and 16th seed was broken three times in the final set to be beaten 2-6, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-0 by French wildcard Hugo Gaston, ranked 239th in the world.

Bopanna loses

In doubles, Rohan Bopanna and Denis Shapovalov crashed out in the first round, losing to Jack Sock and Vasek Pospisil 6-2, 6-2.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/u0a15c/article32762781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FRANCETENNISFRENCHOPEN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/djokovic-advances-with-a-slick-win-altmaier-stuns-berrettini/article32762769.ece
3,2020/10/03,French Open 2020 | Jabeur becomes first Arab woman to reach last 16,"Sofia Kenin and Stefanos Tsitsipas also advanced to the fourth round.

Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur became the first Arab woman to reach the fourth round of the French Open as she beat eighth seed Aryna Sabalenka 7-6(7) 2-6 6-3 on Saturday.

The 30th seed displayed her trademark court craft to undermine Sabalenka's power as she surpassed her previous best third round showing at Roland Garros in 2017.

Sabalenka led 5-1 in the opening set tie break, but a series of errors allowed 26-year-old Jabeur to snatch it.

Former French Open junior champion Jabeur's level dipped in the face of some fierce Sabalenka hitting as the second set slipped away in little over 20 minutes.

But the Tunisian, who became the first Arab woman to reach a Grand Slam quarterfinal in Australia this year, re-grouped and forged 3-0 ahead in the deciding set.

She also had points for a 4-0 lead, but Belarussian Sabalenka upped the intensity and the decibel level to stay in contention.

Sabalenka saved three match points at 2-5, then had a break point in the next game. But Jabeur remained composed as she brought up a match point and showed great touch to angle away a short forehand, then sealing the win with a first serve.

Kenin races into fourth round

American fourth seed Sofia Kenin stormed into the fourth round of the French Open with a 6-2 6-0 demolition of Romanian qualifier Irina Bara.

The Australian Open champion lost the first two games before turning on the power and winning the remaining 12 to reach the last 16 at Roland Garros for the second time.

Bara took her chances early on and broke for 2-0 but her hopes of a major upset were shortlived as Kenin shook her early jitters to advance.

She only had trouble finishing it off on her own serve, most of her drop shot attempts failing in embarrassing fashion.

Kenin could face a Romanian player for the third round in a row if Patricia Maria Tig beats Frenchwoman Fiona Ferro later on Saturday

Tsitsipas through to fourth round after injured Bedene retires

Greek fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas advanced to the fourth round after his opponent Aljaz Bedene retired with an ankle injury while trailing 6-1 6-2 3-1.

Slovenian Bedene, who defeated Tsitsipas in straight sets when they met at Rotterdam earlier this year, first called for the physiotherapist on Court Suzanne Lenglen to get treatment on his right ankle after going down 5-0 in the opening set.

After returning to court Bedene won the first game to get on the scoreboard and then got his ankle strapped before the start of the second set.

Tsitsipas, the reigning ATP Finals champion, kept his focus and went about his business smoothly, hitting 28 winners and breaking the 56th-ranked Bedene's serve five times before the 31-year-old decided he could no longer continue.

In his fourth round, the Greek will play the winner of the match between Bulgarian 18th seed Grigor Dimitrov and Roberto Carballes Baena of Spain.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/tx5plt/article32761500.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JABEUR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/french-open-2020-tennis-tournament/article32761501.ece

6,2020/10/03,French Pacific outpost decides on independence,"New Caledonia votes in a referendum

The French South Pacific territory of New Caledonia votes in a referendum on independence on Sunday, with voters expected to reject breaking away from France after almost 170 years despite rising support for the move.

The referendum is part of a carefully negotiated de-colonisation plan agreed in 1998, known as the Noumea Accord, designed to put an end to a deadly conflict between the mostly pro-independence indigenous Kanak population, and the descendants of European settlers known as “Caldoches”.

Violence in the 1980s culminated in a drawn-out hostage crisis in 1988 that saw 19 separatists killed on one side, and six police and special forces on the other.

It will be the second time the archipelago goes to the polls to decide on its fate in two years, after a first referendum in 2018 resulted in status quo with 56.7% of the vote. But the result still marked a shift towards pro-independence sympathies, raising campaigners’ hopes that this time it could manage to break free.

Political observers say a majority “Yes” to independence is unlikely, although there have been no opinion polls to help provide guidance. “I would be surprised if the Yes-vote won,” said Pierre-Christophe Pantz, a Noumea-based expert in geopolitics.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/french-pacific-outpost-decides-on-independence/article32762143.ece
7,2020/10/03,Coronavirus | Donald Trump doing 'very well': White House medical staff,"Dr. Conley declined to say when Mr. Trump last tested negative. He also did not answer a question on whether Mr. Trump had ever been on oxygen

U.S. President Donald Trump, who announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus during early Friday morning, is doing “very well” as per his physician Sean Conley.

The President’s treatment includes a five day course of remdesivir and a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies, an experimental therapy. The doctor’s comments have also raised questions on the timeline of Mr. Trump’s diagnosis.

A number of others who had been in contact with the President at the confirmation hearing of Judge Amy Coney Barrett on September 26, have also tested positive for the virus.

“At this time, the team and I are extremely happy with the progress the President has made,” Dr Conley said, as he stood with other members of the President’s treatment team outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre – a military hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.

Dr. Conley said on Saturday afternoon that it was “72 hours into the diagnosis”, which implied a Wednesday afternoon diagnosis. The President travelled to a fundraiser at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Thursday. The White House informed the press of the diagnosis on Friday morning at 1 a.m.

When questioned on the timing of the diagnosis, Dr. Conley said, “Thursday afternoon, following the news of a close contact is when we repeated testing. And given kind of clinical indications and a little bit more concern and that’s when that…and late last night, we got the PCR confirmation that he was.”

A White House official said , after the medical briefing that the doctor had misspoken about when the diagnosis was made, as per a report in the Washington Post.

Dr. Conley declined to say when Mr Trump last tested negative. He also did not answer a question on whether Mr Trump had ever been on oxygen (which is often needed when blood oxygen saturation levels drop to unsafe levels). Instead, he reluctantly revealed the President was not given any on Thursday, Friday (while at Walter Reed) or Saturday morning prior to the briefing.

This does not rule out the possibility that he received oxygen at the White House, before being transferred to Walter Reed out of “an abundance of caution.”

Dr Conley said the President was walking around and in “exceptionally good spirits” on Saturday and had not had a fever for the last 24 hours. Mr. Trump had earlier had a fever, cough, congestion and fatigue as per reports. A prolific tweeter, the President was uncharacteristically quiet on the website on Friday and Saturday morning.

“Going welI, I think! Thank you to all. LOVE!!!” he tweeted close to midnight on Friday. On Saturday, he thanked the doctors and nurses in a tweet, saying that with their help he was “feeling well.” Mr. Trump also wrote that “tremendous progress” had been made in fighting “this plague” over the last six months.

First Lady Melania Trump, who also announced on Friday that she had tested positive, showed “no indication for hospitalization” as per Dr Conley and was convalescing at the White House.

Current and former Trump advisers Hope Hicks and Kellyanne Conway, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Mr Trump’s campaign manager Bill Stepien were among those in the President’s circle who have tested positive.

8,2020/10/03,Nagorno-Karabakh | Battle for the black mountains,"The landlocked, forested region is at the centre of Armenia-Azerbaijan clashes

The story of Nagorno-Karabakh, the landlocked, mountainous territory that has been at the centre of the clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, has been that of imperial conquests, ethnic violence, civil strife and mass uprisings. Once a part of the Armenian Kingdom, Nagorno-Karabakh (literal meaning, mountainous black garden) has seen all empires — the Romans, the Persians, the Ottomans, the Russians and the Soviets — that came to Transcaucasia establishing their rule over itself. When empires retreated or collapsed, Nagorno-Karabakh, located between the southern part of the Lesser Caucasus range and the eastern edge of the Armenian Highlands, and largely populated by ethnic Armenians, was left within the borders of Azerbaijan, igniting a protracted conflict that’s still raging.

The roots of today’s conflict go back to the time when Transcaucasia (or South Caucasus) was part of the Russian Empire. Tsarist Russia took over the region in the early 19th century after the Russo-Persian wars from the Persian Empire, which had suzerainty over the region for centuries. After the 1917 revolution, the Russian influence receded in the South Caucasus, which allowed the formation of an independent Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. Karabakh became a part of this republic.

But the federation crumbled under its own contradictions and then emerged three separate republics — Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Nagorno-Karabakh, which had been part of the Elisabethpol Governorate of the Russian Empire, was incorporated into Azerbaijan by the Azeri authorities. This was also the time when the Ottomans were attacking the region, mainly targeting Armenian militias, in an alliance with Azerbaijan. When the Ottomans, in the face of defeat in the First World War, withdrew from the South Caucasus, the British temporarily filled the vacuum. But they, too, failed to calm the ethnic tensions, which led to an open war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1920. The war was disastrous, especially for the ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijani forces, after repelling an Armenian offensive, burnt down parts of Shusha, Nagorno-Karabakh’s capital. “The most beautiful Armenian city has been destroyed, crushed to its foundations; we have seen corpses of women and children in wells,” Soviet communist leader Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze later wrote about the war.

When the war was raging, the Bolshevik revolutionaries took over Azerbaijan and Armenia. For the Russians it was an important victory in extending the Soviet rule to the territories of the former Russian Empire. Nagorno-Karabakh at that time was 90% Armenian. But the Soviet leaders (Joseph Stalin was the acting Commissar of Nationalities for the Soviet Union under which the Caucasian Bureau, or the Kavburo, was created) decided to give Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (province) to Azerbaijan, despite protests from Armenia. One explanation was that since Azerbaijan was a regional ally of the Ottoman Empire during the War, Stalin did not want to give more reasons to Turkey to exploit ethnic tensions in the South Caucasus by giving Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia. The Soviets also redrew the map between Azerbaijan and Armenia, which left the Nagorno-Karabakh Oblast within the boundaries of Azerbaijan.

Ethnic frictions

As long as the Soviet Union remained strong, the region had been relatively peaceful. But with the Soviet power receding in the late 1980s, the ethnic frictions started resurfacing. In 1988, the regional assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh passed a resolution to cancel its autonomous status and join Armenia. Azerbaijan opposed this move, leading to violent clashes. When Azerbaijan and Armenia became independent countries, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, in 1991, the tensions over Nagorno-Karabakh led to an open war. The ethnic Armenian rebels of Nagorno-Karabakh, backed by the Armenian government, fought Azerbaijan for years. When a ceasefire was reached in 1994, the rebels had not only ensured their rule over what was the Nagorno-Karabakh Oblast, they had also extended their control to the Armenian borders, re-establishing territorial continuity with Armenia. The rebels had also declared independence in the region (Republic of Artsakh), which has not been recognised by any country.

Despite the ceasefire, Armenia and Azerbaijan failed to reach a peace agreement. Azerbaijan continues to claim sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh, and Armenia accused the Azeri forces of attacking ethnic Armenians. In July this year, violence erupted, which left some 16 people dead. Since then, the border has remained tense. In the current spell of clashes, which broke out on September 27, dozens have already been killed.

Azerbaijan, with direct support from Turkey, seems to be emboldened now. Nagorno-Karabakh is dependent on Armenia for security. Armenia, in turn, is dependent on Moscow, which enjoys good relationships with both Baku and Yerevan. That’s why Russia has called for a ceasefire.

On April 5, 2010, a 39-minute video was released by a website, called wikileaks.org, that showed gun-sight footage of two U.S. AH-64 Apache helicopters in action during the Iraqi insurgency against the U.S. occupation in 2007. The video showed the helicopter crew firing indiscriminately and killing civilians and two Reuters war correspondents. For nearly three years, Reuters had sought access to this video that would have shed light on the killing of its correspondents, via the U.S.’ Freedom of Information Act but had failed.

The release of the video by WikiLeaks was made possible by the leak of nearly 400,000 documents called the Iraq War Logs from the U.S. Department of Defense databases by the intelligence analyst Bradley Manning (who later referred herself as Chelsea), who acted as a whistle-blower. Ms. Manning had copied these files into a CD-ROM and uploaded them onto a WikiLeaks dropbox.

WikiLeaks promptly went on to release the war logs which were published by a host of media organisations and went on to expose human rights abuses by occupation forces besides the increased fatality counts in Iraq.

The War Logs’ release was followed by the publication of several news stories based on thousands of leaked diplomatic cables that were also released by Ms. Manning, leading to significant public exposure of the ways, lifestyles and attitudes of the elite in various countries. The WikiLeaks model — using crytographic tools to protect sources and allowing for anonymous “leaks” of sensitive information (that could also be in public interest) to be published — suddenly bought forth a new model of extensive investigative journalism into areas that were relatively shielded from the public eye. It is difficult not to associate WikiLeaks with the efforts of one individual — Julian Assange, the 49-year-old Australian by birth and who personified and organised it, even if the portal was maintained and sustained by hundreds of volunteers across the globe.

Asylum in Embassy

Ten years since the release of the Iraq War Logs, Mr. Assange is undergoing trial in the U.K. on whether he should be extradited to the U.S. to face charges related to the leaking of classified documents that exposed U.S. war crimes. Seven of those years were spent in asylum in the small Ecuador Embassy in London, after Mr. Assange refused extradition to Sweden to face charges of rape, which were later dismissed by Swedish prosecutors. The then Ecuador President Rafael Correa had extended asylum to Mr. Assange, but he could not guarantee safe passage for travel as British authorities threatened arrest as soon as he left the Embassy premises. Mr. Assange had always indicated that extradition to Sweden was a ploy for him to be handed over to the U.S., where Ms. Manning was convicted by court martial in July 2013 for violating the Espionage Act and underwent rigorous imprisonment before her sentence was commuted by President Barack Obama in January 2017. The Obama administration, however, concluded that it will not pursue criminal charges against Mr. Assange and WikiLeaks for publishing classified information as it would be inconsistent with the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution that guarantees freedom of speech of the press.

Mr. Assange continued to front the activities of WikiLeaks even during his refuge in the Ecuador Embassy. WikiLeaks published emails sent and received by U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and went on to release Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails that were obtained allegedly by Russian intelligence agency hackers. The DNC email releases hinted at bias by the committee against the other presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Mr. Assange denied that the source of the hack was Russian agencies. The CIA later told U.S. legislators that the intelligence community had concluded that Russia had conducted operations during the 2016 elections to prevent Ms. Clinton from winning the presidency.

Ms. Clinton’s Republican opponent and later U.S. President Donald Trump revealed in the email controversy that the WikiLeaks’ published emails had got Ms. Clinton into as he even said during the campaign, “I love WikiLeaks”. Later, however, during the Trump administration, his former Attorney-General Jeff Sessions and then CIA director Mike Pompeo sought to prosecute Mr. Assange over espionage charges. In April 2017, the Trump administration’s Justice Department had charged him in a sealed indictment. On May 23, 2019, 18 federal criminal charges under the Espionage Age of 1917 were brought by the Justice Department against Mr. Assange for his involvement in “computer intrusion” and leaking of classified information. In June 2020, the charges were further expanded for conspiracy with hacker groups.

Before the trial in the U.K. that began in September 2020, Mr Assange underwent imprisonment for 50 weeks for bail violations during his refuge in the Ecuador Embassy. His arrest also occurred after new President Lenin Moreno revoked his asylum and his citizenship (granted in 2018) on April 11, 2019, following disputes with Ecuador authorities.

Mr. Assange’s lawyers have sought to block the U.S. extradition request saying the leaks have led to exposure of war crimes and grave violations of laws. The lawyer appearing for the U.S. authorities has, however, claimed that the U.S. charges relate to the publication of names of informants in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Mr. Assange, in his younger days, was a prodigious teenage hacker who was charged and later let off for activities related to invasion into private computers. He later went onto become a “cypherpunk” — an activist who uses cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies to promote social and political change — a path that led him to found WikiLeaks. The site went on to become a key outlet for whistleblowers, the most prominent of whom was Ms. Manning who threw open a window into the functioning of the defence and diplomatic arms of the world’s lone superpower. This propelled him into becoming a “global hacktivist” of sorts but his ploy to use WikiLeaks as a means to influence the bipolar U.S. politics has complicated his public image.

It remains to be seen whether the U.K. court will consider his plea not to be extradited on merits of his role as a publisher of sensitive information, something that has been performed by news organisations the world over.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8r7n7g/article32762019.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Julian1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/julian-assange-enemy-of-the-state/article32762020.ece
10,2020/10/03,British PM Johnson upbeat on EU trade pact before key talks,"He wants the deal by October 15 so that it can be ratified on time

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Saturday that “there’s a good deal to be done” with the European Union on post-Brexit trade, as he prepared for scheduled talks with European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen.

Mr. Johnson told reporters that the U.K. wants a free trade deal along the lines of the one the EU has with Canada, but is also prepared for negotiations to fail.

“We’re resolved on either course, we’re prepared for either course and we’ll make it work, but it’s very much up to our friends and partners,” Mr. Johnson said.

The two parties are trying to strike a rudimentary trade deal before the Brexit transition period ends on December 31, to avoid a barrage of uncertainty, tariffs and red tape that would hurt economies on both sides.

Deadlock remains

But while negotiators have inched close to agreement in many areas during six months of talks, they remain deadlocked over European fishing boats’ access to U.K. waters, and over the level of support governments can give to industry. The EU is concerned that British plans to subsidise sectors such as technology will amount to unfair competition.

“We should not forget that we have made progress on many, many different fields. But, of course, the most difficult ones are still completely open,” Ms. von der Leyen said on Friday.

“We want a deal because we think it is better to have a deal as neighbours - also, on top of these COVID times with devastating impact on the economies,” she said. “But not at any price.”

Mr. Johnson said an October 15-16 EU summit is effectively the deadline for a deal if it is to be ratified by year’s end, though EU officials think talks may drag on beyond then.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y4st6g/article32761927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-BRITAIN-POLITICS-HEALTH-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/british-pm-johnson-upbeat-on-eu-trade-pact-before-key-talks/article32761928.ece
11,2020/10/03,Syrian rebels join Azeris to feed families,"Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says 850 fighters are headed to Azerbaijan

Desperate to help his family displaced by Syria’s war, pro-Turkey rebel fighter Abu Ahmad is waiting to be deployed to Azerbaijan hoping to earn almost 80 times his current salary.

“I signed up to fight more than a week ago to go to Azerbaijan... for three months in exchange for $2,000 a month,” the 26-year-old told AFP.

Clashes erupted on Sunday between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces over Nagorno-Karabakh. Ankara is backing Baku and has been accused by Yerevan of sending its Syrian proxies to bolster Azerbaijani troops.

From a camp for the displaced in north Syria controlled by Turkey-backed rebels, Abu Ahmad said he was heading to Karabakh hoping to better provide for his wife and children. “We lost our villages and our homes, and we have nothing left to eat,” said Abu Ahmad.

With reports of Syrians killed in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abu Ahmad realises he is taking a risk. But “we have no other option,” he said. “We’ve reached the point where we’re ready to sacrifice ourselves to provide for our children.”

12,2020/10/03,Intense fighting in Karabakh after ‘Azerbaijan offensive’,"Armenia says 51 more separatist fighters

Armenian and Azerbaijani forces are engaged in intense fighting over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region after Azerbaijan launched a large-scale new offensive on Saturday, Armenian officials said.

Armenia said that 51 more separatist soldiers had died in clashes with Azerbaijani forces in the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region as fighting over the disputed territory entered a seventh day.

The government published a list with the names of the 51 dead servicemen on its website, hours after the leader of the separatist region, Arayik Harutyunyan, said a “final battle” was under way with Azerbaijani forces and that he was joining the fighting on the Karabakh frontline.

“The nation and motherland are under threat. Time has come for the entire nation to become a powerful army,” Mr. Harutyunyan told journalists before joining troops at the battlefield.

Baku and Yerevan have defied international calls for a ceasefire and accused each other of starting clashes that began last Sunday and have seen the heaviest fighting since a 1994 ceasefire.

“Heavy fighting is ongoing on other flanks,” Armenian Defence Ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said wrote on Facebook.

‘Heroic resistance’

Karabakh Army spokesman Suren Sarumyan said Azerbaijani forces, who were using aviation, drones, and tanks met “heroic resistance” from separatist fighters.

The Azerbaijani Defence Ministry claimed its forces had “captured new footholds (in Karabakh) and cleaned up the territory from enemy troops.”

Nearly 200 people have been confirmed killed since the fighting erupted last Sunday, including more than 30 civilians.

13,2020/10/03,Truck bomb in eastern Afghanistan province kills at least 15: Officials,"A spokesperson for the provincial government said the number of casualties, most of whom were civilians, could rise and that dozens of people were also injured by the blast in Ghani Khel district.

Attackers set off a truck bomb in Afghanistan’s eastern Nangarhar province on October 3, killing at least 15 people and wounding dozens, according to provincial officials, as violence continues in the war-torn nation despite peace talks taking place in Qatar.

Attaullah Khugyani, a spokesperson for the provincial government, said the number of casualties, most of whom were civilians, could rise and that dozens of people were also injured by the blast in Ghani Khel district.

Obaidullah Shinwari, the Nangarhar provincial council’s member, said 52 people were injured in the blast. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.

Ministry of Interior spokesman Tariq Arian blamed the insurgent Taliban for the attack, saying in the last two weeks they had carried 650 attacks which had killed 69 civilians and wounded 141 people.

The Taliban did not immediately respond to calls requesting comment. Afghan government negotiators are holding talks with the insurgent Taliban in their political capital of Doha in attempts to end decades of conflict, but calls by the government and international community for a ceasefire or reduction in violence have so far been rejected by the Taliban.

Violence has escalated since a reduction in violence period that led up to the United States signing a troop withdrawal with the group, designed to usher the way to peace negotiations, in February.

The Ministry of Interior also said in a Tweet that Afghan forces had killed a key member of the Taliban and arrested five others on Friday night in northern Balkh province.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4jrff1/article32760231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03INAFGHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/truck-bomb-in-eastern-afghanistan-province-kills-at-least-15-officials/article32760232.ece
14,2020/10/03,Germany urges EU to impose sanctions against Russia over Alexei Navalny case,"EU leaders will discuss their reaction and possible sanctions against Russia at their next summit on October 15-16

Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has called for new European Union sanctions against Russia over the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny with an internationally banned nerve agent.

Mr. Navalny emerged in recent weeks from a coma after suddenly falling ill during a flight in Siberia and being air-lifted to Berlin for treatment. German doctors say he was poisoned with Novichok, a Russian nerve agent.

Germany, France and other Western countries have demanded an explanation from the Kremlin for Mr. Navalny's illness. Russia says it has seen no firm evidence he was poisoned and denies involvement in any attack on him.

“I am convinced that there will be no longer any way around sanctions,” Mr. Maas told news portal t-online in an interview on Saturday.

“Sanctions must always be targeted and proportionate. But such a grave violation of the International Chemical Weapons Convention cannot be left unanswered. On this, we're united in Europe,” Mr. Maas added.

Germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the 27-member bloc. EU leaders will discuss their reaction and possible sanctions against Russia at their next summit on October 15-16.

“If the result of the German, Swedish and French laboratories is confirmed, there will be a clear response from the EU. I'm sure about that,” Mr. Maas said.

The Navalny case has worsened relations between Moscow and a number of Western countries. Germany has faced calls to halt the nearly-completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is meant to bring more Russian gas directly to Germany.

Asked if European sanctions against Russia should include Nord Stream 2, Maas said there were more than 100 European companies involved in the project, half of them in Germany.

“So many European workers would suffer from a construction freeze,” Mr. Maas said.

Nord Stream 2 is led by Russia's state gas giant Gazprom , with half of the funding provided by Germany's Uniper and BASF's Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch company Shell, Austria's OMV and France's Engie.

‘Germany denied access’

15,2020/10/03,8 charged in French cryptocurrency scheme to finance jihadis,"This week’s police operation targeted a financing network that has been active since 2019.

France’s anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office said on Saturday that eight people have been charged for their alleged involvement in a complex scheme financing Islamic extremists in Syria through the use of cryptocurrencies.

Two suspects have been handed preliminary charges of financing terrorism and terrorist conspiracy in a judicial investigation opened Saturday.

The same preliminary charges have been given to another suspect in a related case.

Five other people who have been charged with financing terrorism will be sent to trial by the end of the year, the statement said.

The prosecutor’s office said French police arrested a total of 30 people around the country in the case. Most were released without charges.

Earlier this week, a statement from the anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office said search warrants are out for the two main figures in the scheme, French jihadis who have likely been in northwestern Syria since 2013 and are suspected of creating the architecture of this network of terrorism financing.

The scheme was initially uncovered by a team within the French Economy Ministry that traces fiscal fraud, money laundering and terror financing.

This week’s police operation targeted a financing network that has been active since 2019. It was based mainly on the purchase in France of cryptocurrency coupons, details of which were transferred by secure messaging to jihadis in Syria, who could then retrieve the money through cryptocurrency platforms.

Hundreds of thousands of euros are thought to have been supplied via the network, benefiting members of al-Qaida still hiding out in Syria and also jihadis of the Islamic State group.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8-charged-in-french-cryptocurrency-scheme-to-finance-jihadis/article32760027.ece
16,2020/10/03,Pak PM Khan asks party leaders for legal strategy to bring back Sharif from UK,"Sharif has been living in London since November last year.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has asked his party leaders to devise a legal strategy to bring back former premier Nawaz Sharif from the UK as in the absence of an extradition treaty between the two countries it would be difficult to get him extradited, according to a media report.

Presiding over the first meeting of a committee recently formed to counter the Opposition, Prime Minister Khan on Friday asked Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders to foil all moves of the Opposition aimed at destabilising the government and “maligning” the Army, the Dawn News reported.

The government had earlier sent a request to the British government for the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader’s repatriation to ensure that he faces the corruption cases pending against him in the courts.

Sharif has been living in London since November last year when he was allowed to go there for medical treatment. His recent speeches targeting the army for political interference has apparently unnerved the Imran Khan government.

A source privy to the meeting told Dawn that the prime minister was committed to bringing back Sharif from London and directed the committee members to devise a legal strategy because in the absence of an extradition treaty between Pakistan and the UK, it would become difficult to get him extradited.

The committee comprises federal ministers Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Asad Umar, Fawad Chaudhry, Shafqat Mahmood and Pervez Khattak.

Adviser to the Prime Minister on Interior and Accountability Shahzad Akbar had earlier said that he had written fresh letters to the British authorities for Sharif’s repatriation, adding that a formal application has also been sent for his extradition.

The adviser was of the view that though both countries have no extradition treaty, wanted people could be handed over to each other under special arrangement.

On September 15, the Islamabad High Court issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Sharif who failed to surrender before it despite clear warning by the bench. The court said the onus was on the federal government to bring back Sharif from London to stand a trial in Pakistan.

During the meeting on Friday, Prime Minister Khan vowed to defeat the Opposition’s designs and defend state institutions, including the Army.

Enemies of the army are in fact enemies of Pakistan, the prime minister said.

The opposition leaders have a problem with the Army, and that is why their corruption is being traced, he said.

Sharif wants to bring people on to the streets while he and his children are sitting in London, he said, alleging that the former prime minister wanted institutions to protect his interests.

Sharif in a televised speech from exile in London on Thursday accused the country’s powerful military of political interference, saying that the military had rigged the 2018 vote that brought Khan to power.

The Sharif has had a long uneasy relationship with the military, with Thursday’s tirade the latest confrontation.

Sharif served as Pakistan’s prime minister three times, first removed by a president in 1993, then by military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 1999. A court in 2017 ousted him from power over corruption allegations. Khan, a former cricketer, came to power in 2018.

17,2020/10/03,"Two U.S. senators, former Trump aide test positive for COVID-19; cases continue rise in White House","Republican Senators Thom Tillis from North Carolina, and Mike Lee from Utah confirmed they have been tested positive for coronavirus.

Two U.S. Senators, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, his campaign manager and three White House journalists have tested positive for COVID-19, joining several officials working at the presidential palace to have contracted the infection.

Mr. Trump, 74, and First Lady Melania Trump, 50, tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday. The president is receiving treatment at the Walter Reed Military Medical Centre in Bethesda, a Maryland suburb of Washington DC. Ms. Melania has stayed back at the White House.

Hours later, Republican Senators Thom Tillis from North Carolina, and Mike Lee from Utah confirmed they have been tested positive for coronavirus.

“Over the last few months, I’ve been routinely tested for COVID-19, including testing negative last Saturday, but tonight my rapid antigen test came back positive,” Mr. Tillis said in a statement on Friday night.

The Senator from North Carolina said he will be following the recommendations of his doctor and will be self-isolating at home for 10 days and notifying those I’ve been in close contact with.

“Thankfully, I have no symptoms and I feel well,” he said. Senator Tillis is seeking his re-election and is locked in a tight battle with Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham.

Mr. Tellis along with Mr. Lee were seen at the White House last Saturday when President Trump announced his Supreme Court nomination.

“Yesterday morning, I was experiencing symptoms consistent with longtime allergies. Out of an abundance of caution, I sought medical advice and was tested for COVID-19. Unlike the test I took just a few days ago while visiting the White House, yesterday’s test came back positive,” Senator Lee said on Twitter.

Several White House staffers have tested positive with COVID-19 in recent months, including the National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien and Katie Miller, Vice President Pence’s press secretary.

President Trump and Ms. Melania were tested after one of their close aides, Hope Hicks, tested positive for the coronavirus.

Ms. Hicks, 31, is the closest aide of the president to have tested positive with COVID-19. She had travelled with the president on Air Force One earlier this week.

Former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway also announced on Twitter that she has been tested positive.

“Tonight, I tested positive for COVID-19. My symptoms are mild (light cough) and I’m feeling fine. I have begun a quarantine process in consultation with physicians. As always, my heart is with everyone affected by this global pandemic,” she said.

Like Mr. Tellis and Mr. Lee, Ms. Conway had participated in the White House event on Saturday.

Trump Campaign Manager Bill Stepien tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday as well. According to newspaper Politico, Mr. Stepien was experiencing mild flu-like symptoms. He plans to quarantine until he recovers and manage the campaign from home.

Meanwhile in a series of memos, the White House Correspondents Association confirmed that three member journalists have tested positive for COVID-19.

“As of this moment, three White House journalists tested positive for COVID-19 today,” the WHCA said.

One of the journalists was at the Trump White House press conference on Sunday.

The second journalist was recently part of the out-of-town travel pool on Saturday for the president’s trip to Pennsylvania but was briefly at the White House earlier in the day for a COVID-19 test.

The reporter began experiencing symptoms on Thursday and tested positive on Friday, the WHCA said.

The third journalist was recently part of the in-town travel pool on Sunday, which included a presidential news conference and a trip to the golf course.

They also were in the in-town pool on Saturday, which included the Rose Garden event. The journalist began experiencing symptoms late Wednesday and received a positive test result this afternoon (Friday), the WHCA said.

Noting that the White House Medical Unit is beginning the process of contact tracing for these cases, the WHCA said a number of White House journalists are self-isolating pending diagnostic testing.

The WHCA said that members of the press corps were being notified “so that you can make informed judgements.”

“We can’t stress enough the importance of mask-wearing, social distancing and common sense, especially on the White House complex,” the WHCA said.

“Additionally, we are again asking journalists who are not in the pool and do not have an enclosed workspace to refrain from working out of the White House at this time,” it said.

Multiple news outlets, whose correspondents are part of the White House pool said that they are contact tracing and following the procedure for testing and quarantining, depending on the possible exposure.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mwqx1o/article32758061.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THOMTILLIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/two-us-senators-former-trump-aide-test-positive-for-covid-19-cases-continue-rise-in-white-house/article32758062.ece
18,2020/10/03,California nears milestone: 4 million acres burned in fires,"California is poised to hit a fearsome milestone: 4 million acres burned this year by wildfires that have killed 31 people and incinerated hundreds of homes in what is already the worst fire season on record.

Flames have scorched an area larger than Connecticut. Fire crews at a blaze in the wine country north of San Francisco were on high alert Friday as forecasters warned of extreme fire danger into Saturday.

Powerful winds didn’t materialize early Friday, allowing fire crews a chance to make gains. But winds up to 30 mph (48 kph) were forecast to push through the hills of Napa and Sonoma counties as the Glass Fire, which exploded in size earlier in the week, threatens more than 28,000 homes and other buildings.

“So far we have not seen the velocity of the winds that we were expecting,” Cal Fire Battalion Chief Mark Brunton said. “But there will be gusts and ... we do have hot embers and it won’t take much to take that and blow it into a very dry receptive fuel bed. That gives us cause for concern.”

Winds were blowing at higher elevations on the western side of the fire. Crews expected a long battle to keep flames from jumping containment lines and to prevent spot fires from leaping ahead to spark new blazes.

More crews and equipment were deployed in and around Calistoga, a town of 5,000 people known for hot springs, mud baths and wineries in the hills of Napa County about 70 miles (110 km) north of San Francisco.

The area was also experiencing high temperatures and thick smoke that fouled the air throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.

Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists say climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.

The Glass Fire is the fourth major blaze in the region in three years and comes ahead of the third anniversary of an October 8, 2017, wildfire that killed 22 people.

Around the state, 17,000 firefighters were battling nearly two dozen major blazes. Virtually all the damage has occurred since mid-August, when five of the six largest fires in state history erupted. Lightning strikes caused some of the most devastating blazes.

Cal Fire Deputy Chief Jonathan Cox said wildfires have scorched 3.9 million acres in California since August 15. That figure, which works out to more than 6,000 square miles (15,500 square km), is astonishing even in a state that has had its fair share of fires.

We’re at a historic moment where we are going to cross the 4 million acres burned mark in California this year, Mr. Cox said. And unfortunately, we’re just getting into some of the most critical fire months in California.

The death toll increased to 31 people after a person burned in the LNU Lightning Complex died from their injuries, Cal Fire said in a statement. That cluster of fires sparked by lightning in mid-August in the San Francisco Bay Area was fully contained on Thursday.

Fire officials said the Glass Fire was their top priority. Since erupting Sunday, the fire has destroyed nearly 600 buildings, including 220 homes and nearly the same number of commercial structures.

About 80,000 people were under evacuation orders and officials warned that more were possible. Fire and public safety officials asked people to remain vigilant, stay out of evacuation zones and quit demanding that officers let them back into off-limits neighbourhoods.

About 150 miles (240 km) to the north of wine country, the Zogg Fire, which also erupted during Sunday’s high winds and grew quickly, has killed four people and destroyed 153 buildings.

The weekend was expected to usher in some cooling — or less intense heat — and long-range forecast models hinted at the possibility of rain.

Hurricane Marie, spinning in the Pacific southwest of Baja California, was expected to weaken by the middle of next week but leftover tropical moisture may be pulled northward and bring impressive rainfall to Northern California, forecasters said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1wv581/article32757923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-WILDFIRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/california-nears-milestone-4-million-acres-burned-in-fires/article32757924.ece
19,2020/10/03,COVID-19 | U.S. Vice President Pence tests negative,"Mike Pence does not need to quarantine, because he is not considered a close contact with any individuals who have tested positive, his doctor Jesse Schonau said in a statement.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, next in line for the Oval Office, tested negative for COVID-19, hours after President Donald Trump announced that he was infected and went into quarantine, Mr. Pence's spokesman said on Occtober 2.

Trump's test result cast a spotlight on Mr. Pence, a Christian conservative former lawmaker who has been one of the few constants in the Republican president's tumultuous administration, a little more than a month before the pair seek re-election to a second term.

Mr. Pence, 61, is scheduled to debate his Democratic rival, Joe Biden's running mate Senator Kamala Harris on Wednesday in Utah. A source at the Commission on Presidential Debates, which oversees the events, said there were no plans to scrap the debate after Mr. Trump's positive test.

“This morning, Vice President Pence and the Second Lady tested negative for COVID-19. Vice President Pence remains in good health and wishes the Trumps well in their recovery,” spokesman Devin O'Malley said on Twitter.

He does not need to quarantine, because he is not considered a close contact with any individuals who have tested positive, including Mr. Trump, Mr. Pence's doctor Jesse Schonau said in a statement. “Vice President Pence remains in good health and is free to go about his normal activities,” he said.

Mr. Pence, who was last seen publicly with Mr. Trump on Monday at a Rose Garden news conference on coronavirus testing, would take over as acting president should Trump become incapacitated while undergoing medical treatment. That has happened three times in U.S. history.

Then-President George W. Bush temporarily transferred power to Vice President Dick Cheney twice, for a few hours each in 2002 and 2007, while undergoing colonoscopies. Vice President George H.W. Bush was acting president for nearly eight hours in 1985 while President Ronald Reagan had a pre-cancerous lesion removed.

The White House said Trump is “not incapacitated” and is working in isolation while experiencing mild symptoms.

Mr. Pence filled in for Mr. Trump Friday on a conference call with governors about the coronavirus pandemic, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told 1010 WINS radio. He also stood in for Trump on a call with state leaders to discuss support for vulnerable seniors.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi is next in line of succession after Mr. Pence. She was tested Friday for COVID-19 and the results were negative, her spokesman said.

Ms. Harris tested negative on Thursday as part of her campaign's routine screening for the virus.

Mr. Pence, a former governor of Indiana, has played a largely behind-the-scenes role in Mr. Trump's White House, although he is known to have presidential ambitions of his own.

His deference has endeared him to Mr. Trump, helping Mr. Pence survive in a White House with near-constant turnover among top officials. But he has sometimes been ridiculed for his public obsequiousness to his boss.

Earlier this year Mr. Trump put him in charge of the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic, a brief that has not gone well. The nation's death toll from the virus is over 207,000. New cases of COVID-19 rose in 27 out of 50 U.S. states in September compared with August, a Reuters analysis showed.

Mr. Pence has also been central to some of the administrations legislative efforts, including the tax cuts passed in 2017. He staunchly opposes abortion rights and passionately supports de-regulation of business and shrinking the size of government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bp9tk6/article32757256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MIKEPENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-us-vice-president-pence-tests-negative/article32757257.ece
20,2020/10/03,China accuses U.S. at UN of trying to take world back to 'jungle age',"Washington blamed Beijing and UN agencies for “the murder of millions of baby girls.”

China accused the United States on Friday of “fabricating lies” and trying to take the world back to the “jungle age” after Washington blamed Beijing and UN agencies for “the murder of millions of baby girls.”

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) on Friday said it regretted the accusations by U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, which were made at a UN General Assembly meeting on Thursday on the anniversary of a landmark 1995 women's conference.

UNFPA Executive Director Natalia Kanem told reporters that any coercion of women was “against our practice and policy.”

“We accord the highest priority to voluntary sexual and reproductive health, rights, and procedures,” she said. “We have invited reviews of, in the case of UNFPA, our practice and procedures in the country of China, and for the past four years, the United States has not visited our programs.”

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration cut funding in 2017 for UNFPA, saying it “supports ... a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.” The United Nations said that was an inaccurate perception.

Ms. DeVos and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who issued a statement on Thursday, both accused China of subjecting Uighurs and other minorities to forced abortion, forced sterilization, and involuntary implantation of birth control devices.

A spokesperson for China's U.N. mission in New York said in a statement that the remarks were “sheer fabrication.”

“Some U.S. politicians lie and cheat as a habit,” the spokesperson said. “They maliciously create political confrontation and undermine multilateral cooperation. The United States, going against the trend of the times, is becoming the biggest destroyer of the existing international order and trying all means to take the world back to the 'jungle age.'”

Long-simmering tensions between the United States and China have hit the boiling point at the United Nations over the coronavirus pandemic, spotlighting Beijing's bid for greater multilateral influence in a challenge to Washington's traditional leadership.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-accuses-us-at-un-of-trying-to-take-world-back-to-jungle-age/article32756009.ece
21,2020/10/03,Trump to spend days at military hospital after COVID-19 diagnosis,"The U.S. President will be moved to a special suite at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for the next few days as a precautionary measure.

U.S. President Donald Trump was in a military hospital on Saturday for treatment after testing positive for COVID-19, an extraordinary development that upended the presidential race a month before the Nov. 3 election.

Roughly 17 hours after he made his diagnosis public, Trump walked slowly from the White House to a waiting helicopter to be taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He wore a mask and business suit and did not speak to reporters.

“I think I'm doing very well, but we're going to make sure that things work out,” Mr. Trump said in a brief video message posted on Twitter. Early on Friday, he had tweeted that he and the First Lady, Melania Trump, had contracted the virus.

Mr. Trump will work in a special suite at the hospital for the next few days as a precautionary measure, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. Online video showed a small group of Trump supporters outside Walter Reed late on Friday waving Trump 2020 flags, most not wearing masks.

Mr. Trump, 74, has a mild fever, according to a source familiar with the matter. White House doctor Sean P. Conley said late on Friday that Mr. Trump was doing very well, did not need supplemental oxygen, and had received a first dose of Remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral drug sold by Gilead Sciences Inc that has been shown to shorten hospital stays.

In a tweet late on Friday, the president wrote: “Going well, I think! Thank you to all. LOVE!!!”

The diagnosis was the latest setback for the Republican president, who is trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.

Mr. Trump has played down the threat of the coronavirus pandemic from the outset, even as the disease has killed more than 200,000 Americans and hammered the U.S. economy.

A number of other prominent Republicans also tested positive on Friday, including former White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and Republican senators Mike Lee and Thom Tillis.

Vice President Mike Pence, who would take over presidential duties if Trump became severely ill, tested negative, a spokesman said. The former Indiana governor, 61, is working from his own residence several miles from the White House.

Mr. Trump is at high risk because of his age and weight. He has remained in apparent good health during his time in office but is not known to exercise regularly or to follow a healthy diet.

Conley said earlier on Friday that Trump has received an experimental treatment, Regeneron's REGN-COV2, one of several experimental COVID-19 drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, which are used for treating a wide range of illnesses.

Mr. Trump is also taking zinc, Vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and aspirin, Conley said.

Stocks on Wall Street closed lower as news of Trump's diagnosis added to mounting uncertainties surrounding the election.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was himself hospitalized with COVID-19 in April, said on Saturday he had no doubt Trump would make a strong recovery.

“He's a naturally obviously very resilient character and I'm sure he'll come through it very well,” Johnson told reporters.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, joining well-wishers at home and abroad, sent a message to Trump and his wife on Saturday, wishing them a speedy recovery, Chinese state television reported.

Election day looms

With just 31 days to go until Election Day, Trump's campaign said it would postpone rallies and other events where he was scheduled to appear, or take them online.

Mr. Trump's campaign manager, Bill Stepien, also tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday and will work from home, according to a senior campaign official.

Mr. Biden pulled ads attacking Mr. Trump off the air but otherwise continued his campaign, travelling to Michigan on Friday after testing negative for the virus.

At a union hall in Grand Rapids, Biden said he was praying for his rival's recovery. However, he also implicitly criticized Trump, who has mocked Biden for routinely wearing a mask and has held huge campaign rallies with little social distancing.

“Be patriotic,” Mr. Biden said. “It's not about being a tough guy. It's about doing your part.”

The Republican National Committee would choose a replacement nominee if Trump were to become incapacitated, but it is too late in most states to change the names on the ballot. Some 2.9 million people have already voted, according to figures compiled by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald.

Mr. Pence took over Mr. Trump's planned calls with governors and retirees' organizations. His Oct. 7 debate with Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris will go forward as planned, organizers said.

Ms. Harris has also tested negative, according to the campaign.

The virus could complicate Mr. Trump's push to install conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court.

In addition to the president and his wife, at least four people who were at a White House event to announce Barrett's nomination — Conway, Lee, Tillis and University of Notre Dame President John Jenkins - said Friday they have tested positive.

Lee and Tillis are both members of the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, which is scheduled to begin hearings on Barrett's nomination on Oct. 12.

Barrett herself tested positive for the virus earlier this year and recovered, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Tillis, who said in a statement that he has no symptoms, will isolate at home for 10 days.

22,2020/10/03,Bihar Assembly elections | Mahagathbandhan seals seat-sharing deal,"RJD to get 144 seats, Congress 70 and Left parties 29; VIP chief announces parting of ways.

The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led mahagathbandhan (‘grand alliance’) on Saturday sealed seat sharing among allies and appealed to the people of Bihar to give them one chance to govern the State as “Bihar needs an option, a change”.

But at the end of press meet, a “hurt” Vikasheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahni stunned mahagathbandhan leaders by announcing a parting of ways from the ‘grand alliance’ as he had been “back-stabbed”.

Meanwhile, confusion still reigns in the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) as senior party leaders of the Janata Dal-United (JD-U) were seen rushing to meet Bihar in-charge of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Bhupendra Yadav in Patna on Saturday.

“As per the agreement between our alliance partners, the RJD will get 144 seats; the Congress Party will get 70 seats; the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) will get 19 seats; CPI (Communist Party of India) will get six seats; and the CPI-M (Communist Party of India-Marxist) will get four seats. The RJD will accommodate the other two partners — Mukesh Sahni-led Vikasheel Insaan Party, and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha — from its own quota of 144 seats,” declared RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, while addressing a crowded press meet at a luxury hotel in Patna.

However, at the end of the press meet, the VIP’s Mr. Sahni alleged, “I was offered 25 seats along with the post of Deputy CM but we are being back-stabbed. It is a cheating of people of the Extremely Backward Class.” He then left in a hurry.

VIP supporters also raised slogans against Tejashwi Yadav and his older brother Tej Pratap Yadav outside the venue, and tried to gherao the RJD leaders.

At the press meet, Mr. Tejashwi Yadav also slammed the present Nitish Kumar-led NDA government in Bihar and said, “Every four hours one incident of rape takes place, and every five hours one murder happens in the State today.”

“This government must go,” he asserted, and appealed to the people to give “one chance to mahagathbandhan for maan-sammaan (dignity and respect), security and development of the State”.

“I’m a true Bihari and my DNA is also pure,” said Mr. Tejashwi Yadav, taking a jibe at CM Nitish Kumar, against whom Prime Minister Narendra Modi had, earlier, raised questions over his “DNA” and create a political storm.

“If we form the government, I will provide 10 lakh jobs to the unemployed youths of the State with my first signature at the very first Cabinet meeting of the government,” said Mr. Tejashwi Yadav.

Earlier, State Bahujan Samaj Party president Bharat Bind quit the party to join the RJD. Mr. Tejashwi Yadav gave him the membership of the party.

Later, leaders of other parties, like the Congress and Left parties, who were present on the occasion, said they were satisfied with the allocation of seats among the mahagathbandhan parties.

Senior Congress leader and chairman of the Congress party’s screening committee for candidates Avinash Pandey also declared that RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav would be the leader of mahagathbandhan in the upcoming Assembly poll.

Meanwhile, leaders of the JD(U) and BJP huddled in separate meetings to reach a consensus over the allocation of seats among the NDA allies .

Senior JD(U) leaders Rajeev Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, R.C.P. Singh and Vijay Choudhury rushed to meet the BJP’s Bihar in-charge Bhupendra Yadav on Saturday in Patna.

The BJP’s Bihar in-charge Bhupendra Yadav and poll in-charge Devendra Fadnavis went to Delhi on Friday and returned to Patna on Saturday to conclude the seat-sharing deal among the allies.

The three-phase poll for 243 Assembly seats in Bihar is scheduled to take place on October 28, November 3 and 7, and the results will be declared on November 10.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5z3zr5/article32760969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BIHARjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-elections-mahagathbandhan-clinches-seat-sharing-deal/article32760480.ece
23,2020/10/03,Harvey Weinstein charged with six more counts of sexual assault in Los Angeles,"The charges involve two victims and stem from incidents that occurred more than a decade ago, District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement.

Disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein has been charged with six more counts of forcible sexual assault in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles District Attorney said on Friday.

The charges involve two victims and stem from incidents that occurred more than a decade ago, District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement.

Weinstein, who was convicted earlier this year in New York of sex crimes, now faces a total of four counts each of forcible rape and forcible oral copulation, two counts of sexual battery by restraint and one count of sexual penetration by use of force, involving five victims for crimes that span from 2004 to 2013 in the Los Angeles area, Lacey said.

Also Read Weinstein reaches tentative $19M deal with accusers

Representatives for Weinstein, who is serving 23 years in prison in New York, had no immediate comment on the new charges. Weinstein has always denied having nonconsensual sex with anyone.

If convicted as charged in Los Angeles, the once powerful Hollywood mogul faces up to 140 years to life in state prison, according to Friday's statement.

“I am thankful to the first women who reported these crimes and whose courage have given strength to others to come forward,” Ms. Lacey said in a statement.

“The willingness of these latest victims to testify against a powerful man gives us the additional evidence we need to build a compelling criminal case,” she added.

Weinstein, 68, was originally charged in January by Los Angeles prosecutors with sexually assaulting two women during separate incidents in 2013.

His conviction in New York for sexual assault and rape in a criminal case was hailed as a victory for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct by powerful men.

Prosecutors in Los Angeles have initiated a request for temporary custody of Weinstein from New York. An extradition hearing is set for December.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k9ict3/article31961184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WEINSTEIN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-charged-with-six-more-counts-of-sexual-assault-in-los-angeles/article32757241.ece
24,2020/10/03,A sure thing,"This is a famous deal from long ago. South was the legendary Italian expert Giorgio Belladonna.

This is a surprisingly complicated hand. A spade finesse? A heart finesse? A regular club finesse or a ruffing finesse in clubs? There are many options for declarer, but they all seem dangerous. A foul lie of the cards can lead to defeat, although all of these plays have reasonable chances. In a pair competition, you’d have to choose a line of play that gave you a chance for an overtrick or two. Merely making your contract might not be good enough. This deal was played in a team competition, however, where overtricks are not very important. Making your contract is the key. Belladonna found a line of play that was guaranteed to make his contract on any lie of the cards. Can you spot it?

Belladonna won the opening diamond lead with his ace, crossed to dummy with the ace of clubs, and led a low heart away from dummy’s king! Should East play an honor, Belladonna would have 10 tricks. The worst result would be for South’s jack to lose to West’s queen. West would have to shift to a trump to prevent a heart ruff in dummy. That would give declarer 10 tricks whenever trumps split 2-1. Even if West started with three spades to the king, South would just win in dummy and lead the king of hearts. East would have no trump to lead if he won the ace and West couldn’t lead another trump without giving away his trump trick.

25,2020/10/03,A little bit of saffron can fix everything,"If you are feeling low, broke, unemployed, hungry, or COVID-positive, don’t worry. A little bit of saffron can fix everything

I never believed a day would come when I could write the following sentence without irony: I feel happier, more empowered, and more on top of the world than ever before. My self-esteem, which has traditionally hovered a few feet below the Mariana Trench, is at a historic high — floating several metres above the Statue of Unity. My shuffling gait is gone. In its place now is a majestic swagger that fills onlookers with awe and anti-nationals with dread. But the biggest change is in my self-confidence. From being someone who always tended to doubt his decisions, I am today an audacious embodiment of aggressive arrogance enacted with assured aplomb.

So what is the secret of my transformation? In one word: saffron. In April I got a call from an old friend who used to run a successful Ponzi scheme, better known these days as ‘financial services company’. But during the lockdown, he decided to shut it and start a saffron accessories business.

Change your life

“What kind of accessories?” I remember asking him.

“Since masks are in big demand right now, we’re starting with saffron-coloured masks,” he said.

“How does the colour of a mask matter?” I said.

He shook his head. “You won’t understand. Wait till you actually try the product. It will change your life.”

“Hahaha,” I said. “A mask will change my life?”

“Not only will it change your life, it will also change your life chances,” he said.

“While you’re at it,” I said, “you might as well promise me that it will restore my achhe din and drop ₹15 lakh in my bank account.”

“That too, provided you buy all the accessories to the saffron mask.”

“What accessories?” I said.

“We will also be manufacturing saffron scarves, saffron caps, saffron neckties, saffron bedsheets, saffron headbands, saffron arm bands, and saffron socks,” he said. “Don’t worry, I’ll send you a free sample of each.”

His promised samples arrived last week. I tried them out. And believe it or not, they have transformed my life.

The first time I saw their full transformative power was at the PSU bank where I have an account for the sake of address proof. The staff there is of three kinds: the rude, the indifferent, and the somnolent. I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve taken a token and stood in queue for 45 minutes, only to be told, when I finally reach the counter, that “system is down, come tomorrow.”

Highly potent

But this time, when I walked into the bank wearing my saffron mask, saffron headband, and saffron scarf around my neck, a hush fell over the usual crowd of pointless cash withdrawers, obsessive-compulsive account openers, and serial passbook updaters. The counter clerks stood up one by one and welcomed me with folded hands (the traditional Indian greeting). Everyone — even the security guard — smiled at me. The branch manager rushed out of his cabin to touch my feet (also a traditional Indian greeting). Then he ordered filter coffee and rasgulla for me, and yelled at his minions to fill up my forms and get the job done “asap as possible”. For the first time in my life, I felt like a ‘preferred customer’.

As I was driving back home from the bank, I was so distracted by the novel experience at the bank that I hit a pedestrian, and he fell. I wasn’t driving fast. So, while he wasn’t dead, he was furious. But as I got out of the car to check on him, I saw his expression change. The anger slowly drained from his face, like intelligence from the brain of a TV news panelist. Then there was a jump cut, and he was giving me a big, goofy grin.

As I came up to him, he folded his hands (a traditional Indian form of apology) and said, “Entirely my fault, sir. Wonder what I was doing on the zebra crossing. Please forgive me. I will bear the full expenses for the treatment of my injuries and compensate you for the non-existent damage caused to your car.” I was stunned. For the first time ever I was the undisputed victor of a conflict situation on a Delhi road.

That evening, I decided to try out every one of my friend’s product offerings, and I have to say, all of them are highly potent. My migraine disappears every time I wear the saffron headband. Kattabomman’s nursery teacher pays him more attention during the Zoom classes on the days I wrap his head in a saffron gamcha. Morning walkers proactively, and respectfully, move aside when they see me marching towards them in saffron socks. And since I started using a saffron bed sheet and saffron pillow covers, my nightmares about India’s democracy, judiciary and economy have stopped completely. So if you are feeling a bit low, broke, unemployed, hungry, or COVID-positive, don’t worry. Just remember: there’s nothing that can’t be fixed with a little bit of saffron.",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/uf85y8/article32752456.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04SMSampathonline,https://www.thehindu.com/society/magic-masala/article32752457.ece
26,2020/10/03,Jaygaon exists on the map because of Bhutan. Now the border gate is shut and the town is struggling to survive,"Jaygaon offers three major categories of employment: there are the labourers who work in Bhutan, there are the local businesses patronised by Bhutanese customers, and the flat owners who rent to Bhutanese tenants

Ranged in single file stand Reliance Trends, Pantaloons and Citi Mart, along with many other branded malls, whose density increases as we reach the vibrantly engraved Bhutan Gate. Guarding the border gate between India and Bhutan is a rusted and locked grille. The locked gate is an unusual sight for the people of the small yet densely populated town of Jaygaon that’s known as Jaigaon in West Bengal.

Shutters down

Trucks are lined up on the Jaygaon side of the Bhutan Gate — waiting to deliver food consignments from Kolkata and Siliguri to Bhutan. A few kilometres away is a shopping complex that stands dark and empty, its shutters down and its keepers idle. At the entrance of the complex is a small shop with a heart-shaped leaf drawn on its closed blue shutters.

Wrapping betel leaves around pieces of areca nut and smearing chuna is Atul*. He recalls the days just before the pandemic lockdown was declared. On March 22, he sold 3,000 paans for ₹10 each to his Bhutanese buyers, who take them back to Phuentsholing, a Bhutanese border town. “They love doma paan with Bangla betel leaves. In the last two years alone, around 100 paan shops have popped up in Jaygaon, and 70% of our customers are Bhutanese,” he says. Chewing on a betel leaf, Atul adds, “I hope the Bhutan Gate opens soon, or else I will have to shut shop and sell vegetables instead.”

Gateway to Bhutan

Jaygaon offers three major categories of employment: there are the labourers who work in Bhutan, there are the local businesses patronised by Bhutanese customers, and the flat owners who rent to Bhutanese tenants.

“Jaygaon exists on the map because of Bhutan. And after the lockdown, there are no jobs here any more,” says an employee of a tourism agency in Phuentsholing.

It’s been six months since the Bhutan Gate was closed.

Jaygaon, grandly called the ‘gateway to Bhutan’, has come to a standstill. With each passing month, the people of the town are losing hope that their businesses will ever revive. “People are now moving to Bengaluru to work as labourers,” says a porter. Says Anil Prasad, director of Vakil’s supermarket in Jaygaon, “If the gate doesn’t open soon, I will face massive losses and be forced to shut down and move to Siliguri for better opportunities.”

The restaurants in the area, which primarily catered to the labourers who would pack lunch before they left for Bhutan on work, are all closed.

On March 8, Bhutan cancelled the work permits of hundreds of Indian labourers. In early April, as the coronavirus cases rose, Bhutanese tenants in Jaygaon returned to Phuentsholing. “We transported the belongings of over 200 Bhutanese families to Bhutan Gate,” says Phurba Lama, the Panchayat head of Jaygaon 2.

Twice in size

Meanwhile, India’s loss is Bhutan’s gain. A report in KuenselOnline, a media outlet in Bhutan, says the local economy in Phuentsholing seems to be picking up because buyers are not going to Jaygaon for commodities such as clothes and food.

Jaygaon has grown to twice its original size just in the last two years. Recent data gathered for the West Bengal government showed that some 1,100 labourers had come to Jaygaon from Bihar alone for construction work in Bhutan. Says Phurba Lama, “Jaygaon was just a gram panchayat masquerading as a border town. We demanded a municipality status considering its growing size and density.”

On June 9, at a meeting with the People Welfare Society, Jaygaon’s people demanded the opening of Bhutan Gate for basic business. Lama replied that Bhutan Gate was the property of Bhutan and the administration understood the problem but needed to wait for further dialogue.

“It is understandable that Bhutan is afraid to open the gate,” says Lama. “It is a small country with a population of just eight lakh.” And the pandemic shows no signs of abating in India.

28,2020/10/03,Ride on a gyro chair or have fun with illusions at Hyderabad’s Birla Science Centre with safety rules,"The space museum at the BM Birla Science Centre reopens to give viewers an experiential display

HYDERABAD: After a six-month hiatus, Hyderabad’s BM Birla Science Centre has reopened. Entry rules now include wearing a mask, hand sanitisation and thermal screening. When the first visitor walked in on September 21, the staff couldn’t contain their joy. “It was a festive occasion for us,” gushes an employee. Around 28 visitors came on the first day and the number rose to 75 during weekends. Before the pandemic, the 1,00,000 square feet-centre used to be a bustling hub filled 250-300 visitors and 500 people on weekends.

Museum director BG Sidharth states that the entire complex has undergone sanitisation. “Keeping the campus clean and hygienic and to ensure that no one enters without checks was a big responsibility,” he says.

World of science

Located on the picturesque Naubat Pahad, the 35-year-old Science museum is a favourite outing for Hyderabadis and tourists to explore and learn Science concepts in a fun way. What is fascinates is the way the centre simplifies the subject thus providing an opportunity for both children and adults to interact with its exhibits.

A spinning globe at the entrance draws enthusiasts in; they walk in to be greeted by the planets that orbit the sun with an explanation of how the solar system works.

At a distance are models of different science concepts — from anti-gravity and illusions to centrifugal force. A gyro (spinning) chair based on a gyroscopic principle is ready to take you on a ride and show how a spinning wheel resists change even when you change its momentum. It is time to have fun with illusions — you see water coming from a tap but cannot find its source; ‘Seeing is Believing’ appears as an abstract line but the letters are easily read from another angle bringing optical illusion to the fore.

The Dinosaurium, Archaeology and Dolls galleries in its premises are fun and educational and used to be choc-a-bloc with thousands of visitors, including tourists. The Planetarium is yet to open though. The team recently installed Digistar (computer-based graphics) at the 11,000 square feet large Birla Planetarium. Sidharth calls it a great experience that has been temporarily paused. Since the planetarium gives a ‘theatre experience,’ the centre is waiting for approval from the Government.

In the premises is also the country’s first Space Museum, set up in collaboration with Indian Space Research Organisation last year. Space is a hit with school students, especially for its GSLV rocket (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle) brass model, PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle), Mangalyaan and Chandrayaan spacecraft.

The Space Museum’s collection will add 24 new exhibits in the next six months.

The team used the lockdown period to carry out repair and maintenance works at the premises. Now, most of their employees are back, with a few coming as per a in staggered schedule.

29,2020/10/03,The fine art of community grandparenting,"Through a learning circle and a storytelling programme, grandparents at a gated community on Old Mahabalipuram Road go the extra mile for the sake of Generation Z

The pandemic may have upended priorities, but grandma’s tales — and grandpa’s too — have dodged the virus. In fact, grandparents are thriving as storytellers, getting more “air time” than ever before.

Now, as parents grapple with the challenges of working or working from home in a pandemic situation, stay-at-home children are often left to their own “devices” — actually, their parents’ devices. The fact that classes are now parked online does not help matters — there is too much screen time and it is doing little Johnny no good.

And a roll of storytelling honour at a gated community in Sholinganallur gives a reason to believe that grandparents are stepping up to the plate.

“Though grey hair is no criterion for choosing our storytellers, it so happens that in recent weeks, when we had revived our storytelling programme, nearly ninety percent of the storytellers have been seniors,” says Supriya Santhanam, a resident of The Central Park South (TCPS) and volunteer-in-charge of a library at the community.

The programme in question is “Stories Beneath The Clouds”, an in-person open-air storytelling component of TCPS’ library outreach, that has now been partially revived, stringent safety protocols in place, to tackle children’s gadget addiction during the pandemic.

Besides, grandparents at the community have raised their hands seeking to be included in a listening circle on parenting. This programme takes place once in two weeks on the terrace, following safety protocols.

Bindu Unnikrishan, who handles this programme as facilitator, in association with the library team, explains, “Initially, we started off with parents, and then we had grandparents also expressing their interest to participate in the circle. We felt that this was important, and that it would help every parenting discussion if grandparents brought their own generational light to it. We have grandparents who have shared their experiences, particularly about how parenting has changed — for a grandparent, how their children grew up and how their grandchildren are growing up are different. So, when they listen to parents (other than their own children), these grandparents become aware of new perspectives. Similarly, parents participating in the listening circle, get the perspectives of grandparents (other than what they have heard from their parents).”

Supriya points out that the listening circle has so far had five meet-ups, and its scope has now considerably widened.

Says Bindu, “The listening circle offers a safe space for parents and grandparents to discuss various topics related to parenting and learn from each other. It is a non-judgemental space where participants go back home with takeaways that they can customise for their family. What is discussed in the circle stays within the circle.”

Meet these storytellers

Now, let us get back to the open-air storytelling space — sometimes the poolside, and sometimes the terrace. There, a few senior storytellers from the community would tell you why it is necessary to continue telling those stories to children, in the middle of a pandemic.

Shanti Rajagopalan, 67 years old, can’t forget the joy two girls radiated when they saw each other in person, at a story-telling session, after staying cooped up in their respective homes for five months.

“These two girls are from this gated community, living in different blocks, and have been connecting virtually, but the joy they felt when they met in person — of course, following social distancing and other safety measures — illustrated the power of in-person connections. Plain in-person meeting has a level of interactivity that can’t be replicated by the most sophisticated digital tools. There is a spontaneity to the questions that children ask that is not possible online. From a storyteller’s point of view, we see the children’s reaction. When I tell a story, I don’t tell the story. I ask them questions, and they come up with answers and that shape the story. This interactive process is way easier than when attempted online.”

***

Gita Bharath, who turns 64 in two weeks, is into narrative poetry and has a book in that genre to her credit. She has an acute sense of what a lot of screen time can do to children.

“I have two grandchildren, and the older one developed watery eyes on account of increased screen time,” she discloses. “In-person story-telling is livelier, as it enables more talk points to be introduced into a story. In the story sessions on the terrace, a pageant of unexpected characters would walk, or sometimes, fly into a story. For instance, when we had one recently, a pelican flew by to the Perumbakkam Marsh, and the storyline took a detour to include this wetland. When children were told to stretch their hands in all four directions when a story was being acted out, I explained the geographical features found on each side. Stories anchored in one’s immediate environment stay with children longer. If the mission is to wean children off gadgets through storytelling, the stories should be full of life.”

***

Kusum Nathany, 66 years old, is the fulcrum of a joint family, and she shares the roof with five grandchildren. She therefore steps naturally into the role of a community grandmother.

“All the children in the community call me ‘daadi’,” she begins. “When online classes pop up on the screen, children wish they were offline. Otherwise, they would rather be online than anywhere else. Due to the pandemic, gadget addiction among children has assumed mammoth proportions, and intervention is necessary. This necessity provides meaning to what I am doing now.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/edqn6t/article32760173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10dctngr-Grandparents,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-fine-art-of-community-grandparenting/article32757809.ece

34,2020/10/03,Amnesty International | On the front lines of rights and rows,"The advocacy group, known for its campaigns and controversies, has exited India accusing the government of a ‘witch hunt’

Just past 10am on September 29, a notice went up on global human rights agency Amnesty International’s India webpage. The notice said that owing to the fact that the government had frozen all its funds through an order earlier in the month, Amnesty was shutting down its India operations, laying off about 150 people and ending its presence in the country, 55 years after it had set up its first office in India.

Also read: Constraining critique: On Amnesty halting India operations

Amnesty’s closure evoked concern from the U.K., where Amnesty is headquartered, the 27-nation EU and the U.S. Both the EU and the U.K. said their officials had met Indian officials in Delhi and in Brussels and London, and said they hoped that Amnesty could continue its work in the future, but the government has firmly told them not to interfere. Prior to this, other international groups like Ford Foundation, Greenpeace and Compassion International have faced similar restrictions, part of a list of at least 20 foreign NGOs on the government’s scanner.

While Amnesty’s notice said the actions by the government were part of an “incessant witch-hunt” that had failed to produce evidence of wrong-doing, the government said it had a long list of charges pertaining to the funding of the group and its interference in India’s internal affairs, dismissing its claims of conducting humanitarian work as “glossy statements”.

Over the past decade, the Ministry of Home Affairs has conducted an investigation into the workings of the group, and even raided its offices in Bengaluru in 2018, summoning various officials and staff members for questioning, and sending income tax notices to its Indian donors.

It also pointed out that Amnesty International’s India chapter had been given clearance to accept funds as an NGO under the Foreign Contributions Regulatory Act (FCRA) only once, in the year 2000, but had “circumvented” laws to receive foreign funds through commercial means since then. Eventually, the government said, it had had to block foreign funds of about ₹8 crore to Amnesty India due to their “dubious” routing, in “bipartisan” actions taken by the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government and the Narendra Modi-led NDA government, and the Enforcement Directorate served a show-cause notice to the human rights body for alleged violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), involving a total of ₹51.72 crore.

“Human rights cannot be an excuse for defying the law of the land,” said the government. Amnesty shot back that the government had carried out its crackdown due to its anger over Amnesty’s reports on alleged human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir, and more recently, on what it called “police complicity” in the Delhi riots of February 2020, in which 53 people were killed.

“Amnesty has never been particularly welcome in India even under previous governments,” said former Amnesty International India’s executive director Aakar Patel, who has himself faced many enquiries and interrogations. He said that raising contentious issues like the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), Jammu and Kashmir, the 1984 Sikh massacre, land rights in coal mine areas and journalist protections had always made it difficult for the group to engage with the state.

The West factor

Given a self-proclaimed mandate to raise such issues, Amnesty is not particularly welcome in many of the countries it works in, and is often accused of working for western, interventionist powers, and of gathering intelligence and fomenting trouble in the countries it reports on. In Nigeria, it faced massive protests over its report on sexual violence by the military.

In Turkey, its top officials were arrested in 2017 on charges of links to the Fethullah Gulen group accused of attempting a coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Amnesty does not have offices in Pakistan, nor has it been able to set up offices in mainland China (it operates from Hong Kong), but its reports on enforced disappearances, minority rights and the blasphemy law in Pakistan, and the treatment of Uighurs, Tibetans, and democracy activists in China have put it on collision course with those countries. In Russia, in 2016, Amnesty’s offices were sealed and then seized, over a series of reports on human rights violations in the North Caucasus, as well as in Syria and Ukraine, leading to the only other time the group has been forced to close its country operations besides in India.

Amnesty now operates in about 150 countries, and claims a global membership of 7 million, which would make the number of its concerned citizens larger than the populations of Denmark or Lebanon. Its original mandate, when it was set up by British lawyer Peter Benenson in 1961, was to campaign for the freedom of “prisoners of conscience”, or political prisoners around the world. Benenson’s first campaign, for two Portuguese students arrested for raising a toast “to freedom” in a public restaurant during the reign of dictator António Salazar, led to a major newspaper campaign for other political prisoners, many of whom were released as a result of the international spotlight on them.

Once set up, Amnesty broadened its mandate to deal with torture, executions, and other human rights issues, where its volunteers would bombard governments with letters until they were forced to pay attention to the issue. Among its successes, Amnesty counts its efforts towards the setting up of the International Criminal Court to try war criminals, as well as the end of capital punishment in more than 100 countries, among a total of about 24,000 campaigns it lists on its website. In 1977, when Amnesty won the Nobel Peace Prize, its citation called the group a “light in the darkness”, in a reference to its logo of a candle surrounded by barbed wire.

Controversies within

However, there were questions on the group’s own operations and the organisation has also had its share of controversies internally. Benenson himself resigned from the organisation in 1966, claiming it had been infiltrated by the British Foreign Office and MI-6, a charge that lingers to this day, despite repeated denials from the group.

In the 1990s, the group was accused of helping prepare the U.S. case for the war against Iraq, with a report on Kuwaiti hospitals ravaged by Saddam Hussein’s Army that later turned out to be false, and faced a major controversy over its partnership with a British Taliban sympathiser, jailed by U.S. forces in Afghanistan for al-Qaeda links.

Other challenges have come from within the organisation, with accusations of financial mismanagement and overspending on senior staff, inequality and bullying within the workplace, as well as discrimination and ‘selection bias’. The accusation of “western bias” within the organisation has persisted too, despite the fact that since 1992, its Secretaries-General have belonged to Africa and South Asia, including Salil Shetty, a human rights activist from Bangalore, who ran the organisation from 2010 to 2018. But it is the accusation levelled by the government this week, of Amnesty’s “interference in domestic political debates funded by foreign donations”, that remains the biggest challenge the organisation faces globally, 60 years after it was created.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ubptcw/article32761967.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Amnest,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amnesty-international-on-the-front-lines-of-rights-and-rows/article32761968.ece
35,2020/10/03,Congress seizes initiative over Hathras incident,"Opposition party seeks to paint BJP as anti-Dalit ahead of Bihar polls

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s visit to the family of the Hathras rape victim on Saturday seeks to make multiple political points in times of the corona pandemic.

Both leaders had set the stage for the event early in the morning with a series of tweets. While Ms. Vadra alleged insensitivity of the Yogi Adityanath government by asking the victim’s family to take a narco or lie detector test, Mr. Gandhi had tweeted that “no power could stop him from visiting the family”.

Despite having been stopped at the Delhi-Noida (UP) border for a second time in 48 hours, the Congress leaders managed to reach the village and meet the family. The party’s message is clearly aimed at projecting Mr. Gandhi and Ms. Vadra as determined leaders who are ready to hit the streets even in challenging times.

Caught napping

The contrast is sharp with the major opposition parties in the State — the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP) — yet to get off the ground even as the brutal incident sparked off national outrage.

Also Read Hathras gang rape | Yogi Adityanath recommends CBI probe

The visit seems to have immediate as well as long term political goals. From projecting the Congress as a serious player in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the 2022 Assembly polls to portraying the ruling BJP as anti-Dalit just before the Bihar election, the party seems to have a clear strategy.

“The BJP’s 2014 election manifesto promised. “We will accord the highest priority to ensuring their (SCs and STs) security, especially the prevention of atrocities against SCs and STs”. Is that why the posts of Chairperson of the National Commission of Scheduled Castes and National Commission of Scheduled Tribes have remained vacant for several months?” asked former Finance Minister P Chidamabaram in a tweet, keeping up the pressure.

Moral high ground

“The U.P. government is morally corrupt. The victim didn't get treatment, police didn't write her complaint, her body was burnt forcibly and the family is in captivity and is being pressurised. Now, they are being threatened that a narco test will be done on them. This kind of behaviour is not acceptable to the country. Stop threatening the family of the victim,” Ms. Vadra tweeted in the morning.

In U.P., where the Congress has been out of power for over three decades and still doesn't have much of an organisation, the party is trying hard to occupy the political centrestage by consistently taking on the Yogi Adityanath government.

In May, Ms. Vadra had clashed with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over sending 1,000 buses to transport migrant workers who were walking home on foot during the lockdown.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/b2nfwm/article32761914.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4TH-PRIYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-seizes-initiative-over-hathras-incident/article32761915.ece
36,2020/10/03,India reiterates support for abolition of n-weapons,"No change in No First Use policy, says Foreign Secretary Shringla.

India on Saturday reiterated that nuclear weapons should be abolished in a step-by-step non-discriminatory process. Addressing the High-level Meeting to Commemorate and Promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla also said India remains committed to “No First Use” against nuclear weapon states.

“We believe that nuclear disarmament can be achieved through a step-by-step process underwritten by a universal commitment and an agreed multilateral framework. India remains convinced of the need for meaningful dialogue among all States possessing nuclear weapons, for building trust and confidence,” said Mr. Shringla in the virtual message.

Also read | Will India change its 'No First Use' policy?

The comments indicate that India has not revised its key principles regarding the weapons in its arsenal. Following the election victory in 2019, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had hinted at a possibility of changing the No First Use (NFU) principle by declaring that ‘circumstances’ will determine the “No First Use” stance.

“Pokhran is the area which witnessed Atalji’s firm resolve to make India a nuclear power and yet remain firmly committed to the doctrine of NFU. India has strictly adhered to this doctrine. What happens in future depends on the circumstances,” Mr. Singh had said on the death anniversary of the late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

However, Mr. Shringla said on Saturday, “India espouses the policy of ‘No First Use’ against nuclear weapon states and non-use against non-nuclear weapon states. India is a key partner in global efforts towards disarmament and strengthening the non-proliferation order.”

Also read | No change in India’s nuclear doctrine: MEA?

Expressing the position on negotiating disarmament, Mr. Shringla said the Conference on Disarmament (CD) remains the “world’s single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum” and India supports holding of negotiations on a Comprehensive Nuclear Weapons Convention at the CD. India also remains committed to negotiations regarding a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty in the CD on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator or CD/1299 which dates to March 24, 1995.

37,2020/10/03,U.S. Navy aircraft refuels at Port Blair,"This is the first time a U.S. P-8A has got access to the islands under LEMOA

A U.S. Navy P-8A long range Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) landed at Port Blair in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the last week of September for refuelling under the bilateral logistics support agreement, two defence sources confirmed. This is the first time a U.S. P-8 has got access to the islands for operational turnaround.

On Saturday, the second edition of the bilateral naval exercise between India and Bangladesh “Exercise Bongosagar” began in the northern Bay of Bengal which will be followed by a Coordinated Patrol (CORPAT) for the next two days, the Navy said.

“The P-8A was in Port Blair on September 25 for refuelling under the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA). The aircraft came from Japan and was at Port Blair for few hours,” one of the sources said.

More exercises

Another Passage Exercise (PASSEX) between Indian Navy ships and a U.S. aircraft carrier transiting the region as in July is expected to take place later this month, the source added.

While P-8s of India and the U.S. had exercised together in the past, practised locating submarines together and the LEMOA has been operational for few years now, this is the first time the U.S. got access to A&N under LEMOA. Several countries have expressed interest in getting access to the strategically located A&N islands which are close to the Strait of Malacca and global sea lanes of communication.

In July, frontline warships of the Indian Navy conducted a PASSEX with the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz carrier strike group near the Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) islands as it was transiting the Indian Ocean. The USS Nimitz was returning from the South China Sea through the Malacca Strait where it undertook freedom of navigation operations.

There has been a sharp increase in India’s maritime interactions with the Quad countries on a bilateral basis centred around information sharing for improved Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) in the Indian Ocean Region and Indo-Pacific. India has logistics agreements with all three Quad countries — Australia, Japan and the U.S. India has also signed maritime information sharing agreements with Australia and Japan and a similar agreement is in the works with the U.S.

Along with the LEMOA, India has signed three of the four foundational agreements with the U.S., the others being the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) and the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) signed a long time ago. An extension to the GSOMIA, the Industrial Security Annex (ISA), was signed at the last 2+2 dialogue.

With Bangladesh

Ex Bongosagar, whose first edition was held in 2019, is aimed at developing inter-operability and joint operational skills through conduct of a wide spectrum of maritime exercises and operations, the Navy said in a statement. “In this edition of Ex Bongosagar, ships from both navies will participate in surface warfare drills, seamanship evolutions and helicopter operations,” the Navy said.

The exercise will be followed by the 3rd edition CORPAT in Northern Bay of Bengal from October 4-5, wherein Indian and Bangladeshi units will undertake joint patrolling along the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL).

India has deployed anti-submarine warfare corvette INS Kiltan and guided missile corvette INS Khukri for the exercise, while Bangladesh has deployed guided-missile frigate BNS Abu Bakr and guided-missile corvette, BNS Prottoy. In addition to ships, MPA from both navies and integral helicopters would also be participating in the exercise.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/s84b2o/article32761283.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/dinakar-story-photo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/us-navy-aircraft-refuels-at-port-blair/article32760946.ece

In the communication, the countries said there were several reports about intellectual property rights hindering or potentially hindering timely provisioning of affordable medical products to COVID-19 patients and that a particular concern for countries with insufficient or no manufacturing capacity were the requirements of cumbersome and lengthy process of the import and export of pharmaceutical products.

Many countries, especially the developing ones, may face institutional and legal difficulties when using flexibilities available in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement). Beyond patents, other intellectual property rights may also pose a barrier, with limited options to overcome those barriers, noted the submission.

Experts said that given this present context of global emergency, it was important for WTO members to work together to ensure that intellectual property rights such as patents, industrial designs, copyright and protection of undisclosed information did not create barriers to timely access to affordable medical products, including vaccines and medicines, or to scaling up research, development, manufacturing and supply of medical products essential to combat COVID-19.

“The waiver of TRIPS Obligation is a major initiative to ensure availability and affordability of medical products required for COVID19 fights. The medical products companies especially medicine and vaccine manufacturers want to profit from pandemic by keeping the monopoly rights through intellectual protection. This proposal shows the political will of India and South Africa to exercise a legitimate right under the Agreement Establishing WTO to ensure supply of medical products to fight COVID-19 at an affordable price”, said K.M. Gopakumar, legal advisor, Third World Network.

Leena Menghaney of Medecins San Frontieres (India) said they welcomed the proposal from South Africa and India to the WTO TRIPS Council, calling for the waiver of intellectual property such as patents to address COVID-19.

“It is crucial that other member governments of the WTO support this, as we need to ensure that vaccines, drugs, and other medical tools needed for COVID-19 can be scaled up by countries and their manufacturers without facing protracted negotiations for licences”,’ the group said.

It added that in terms of IP and COVID-19, this was one of the biggest developments under international law.

Urgent legal amendments

The proposal also reported that some WTO members had carried out urgent legal amendments to their national patent laws to expedite the process of issuing compulsory/government use licenses.

“Internationally, there is an urgent call for global solidarity, and the unhindered global sharing of technology and knowhow in order that rapid responses for the handling of COVID-19 can be put in place on a real-time basis. In these exceptional circumstances, we request that the Council for TRIPS recommends, as early as possible, to the General Council a waiver from the implementation, application and enforcement of Sections 1, 4, 5, and 7 of Part II of the TRIPS Agreement in relation to prevention, containment or treatment of COVID-19,” the proposal said.

The WTO had cautioned that the “pandemic represents an unprecedented disruption to the global economy and world trade, as production and consumption are scaled back across the globe”.

The proposal submitted that the waiver should continue until widespread vaccination was in place globally, and the majority of the world’s population had developed immunity.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/t4pj9n/article32760769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-s-africa-move-wto-on-covid-19-prevention-treatment/article32760770.ece
39,2020/10/03,"In a crucial outreach, Army Chief, Foreign Secretary to visit Myanmar","Visit is amid mobilisation of its military forces near border with Chittagong.

Chief of the Army Staff Gen. Manoj Naravane and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla will visit Myanmar during October 4-5, the Ministry of External Affairs announced on Saturday. The visit is being viewed as a crucial outreach to Myanmar after months of pandemic when direct interactions were limited.

Gen. Naravane and Mr. Shringla are scheduled to interact with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, Senior General Min Aung-Hlaing, a press release from the Ministry of External Affairs said. “The visit will provide an opportunity to take stock of the existing bilateral ties and strengthen cooperation in areas of mutual interest,” said the press release.

Starting with the January 2000 Myanmar visit of the then Army Chief Gen. V.P. Malik, the military ties have come a long way. In July 2017, a military agreement was sealed during a rare official visit by General Min Aung-Hlaing. Apart from counter-insurgency operations in India’s northeast, the agreement also provided for training of Myanmar’s armed personnel in the defence training establishments.

The upcoming visit is important for multiple reasons but especially because of the recent reported mobilisation of Myanmar’s military forces near the border with Chittagong. The Hindu reported earlier that Dhaka summoned the Ambassador of Myanmar in response and lodged a protest. Deployment of additional troops in the border areas of the Rakhine province of Myanmar has raised the possibility of more exodus of the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar which began in August-September 2017. Bangladesh has been urging India to play a more active role to facilitate the return of the Rohingya refugees from the camps in Chittagong to Rakhine.

Over 1,600 kg of gold seized till September

During the September 29 Joint Consultative Commission meeting with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Foreign Minister of Bangladesh A.K. Abdul Momen requested India to raise the Rohingya issue at the Security Council to increase diplomatic pressure on Myanmar. However, it is not clear whether Mr. Shringla will raise the concerns of Bangladesh with Myanmar. It is understood that the officials will review the Rakhine State Development Programme under which India has extended infrastructure building and humanitarian support to Myanmar for “early stabilisation of the situation in the Rakhine State”.

In the first phase of the initiative, India built 250 modern pre-fabricated houses and supplied 20,000 humanitarian kits of rice, noodles and other items to the Internally Displaced People (IDPs/Rohingya) of Myanmar. Under the second phase, 12 projects including solar power infrastructure, agricultural mechanisation and road construction are being undertaken in Rakhine State. India has proposed the establishment of a skills training centre in Rakhine. “All these efforts are aimed at ensuring an early return of displaced persons there,” said a source requesting anonymity.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/itr82r/article31925548.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARMYCHIEFKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/army-chief-naravane-and-foreign-secretary-shringla-to-visit-myanmar-on-october-4/article32760663.ece

Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale on Saturday said there should not be any politics in the name of atrocities on Dalits which he claimed to have been going on during successive governments in Uttar Pradesh.

“What has happened in Hathras is most terrible. The incident of rape on a Dalit girl is a very serious issue, he said.

Mr. Athawale, who said he will be meeting Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, stated, on the Hathras case, I have to say that there should not be politics in the name of atrocities on Dalits. It is not right to propagate about atrocities on Dalits during Yogi government.”

“It is right that atrocities are taking place but it had been so during the Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati and Akhilesh (Yadav) governments also,” he added.

Backing CM Adityanath on the steps taken by him in the case, the Union minister said the manner in which the woman’s body was cremated was wrong and he would be taking up the issue of action on other officials.

He said the reason behind such atrocities on Dalits is casteism and it will continue till people have casteist mindset.

41,2020/10/03,Coronavirus | India’s COVID-19 case fatality rate continues to be low: Ministry,"While the global CFR stood at 2.97% as on date, the comparative figure for India was 1.56%

Despite escalating COVID-19 cases, the country continues to maintain one of the lowest case fatality rates (CFR) when compared to several nations, said the Union Health Ministry in a release issued on Saturday. While the global CFR stood at 2.97% as on date, the comparative figure for India was 1.56%.

“The deaths per million population in India is among the lowest in the world. While the global average is 130 deaths /million population, India is reporting 73 deaths /million population. India is doing better that Russia, South Africa, United States, Brazil, Spain, France and United Kingdom,’’ noted the release.

Data released by the Ministry said 1,069 deaths have been registered in the past 24 hours, with 10 States and UTs accounting for 84.1% of the fatalities in the past 24 hours. And 39.66% of deaths reported on Friday were from Maharashtra, with 424 deaths, followed by Karnataka with 125 deaths.

Nearly 77% of the active cases were in 10 States/UTs. Maharashtra was at the lead, with more than 2.6 lakh cases. “As on date, the active cases contribute only 14.60% of the positive caseload of the country. For the 12th successive day, India has sustained its steady trend of maintaining the active cases below the 10-lakh mark. The number of active cases today is 9,44,996.

42,2020/10/03,"Over a decade after smoke-free rules in India, questions remain over their efficacy","Experts say Act has been effective in certain areas but there are still many aspects that need to be amended and strengthened

After over a decade of the implementation of smoke-free rules (on October 2, 2008) that banned smoking in all public places in the country, questions remain over the effectiveness of the law.

Experts claim that India it has been effective in certain areas but there are still many aspects that need to be amended and strengthened.

Section (4) of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce Production, Supply and Distribution) Act COTPA 2003 prohibits smoking in all public places. ‘Public Place’ is defined as any place to which the public has access, whether as of right or not, and includes all places visited by general public. Boards containing the warning, “No Smoking Area- Smoking Here is an Offence”, has to be displayed prominently at the entrance of public places.

Chairman of the Max Institute of Cancer Care Harit Chaturvedi said, “What continues to remain matter of concern is the fact that COTPA 2003, presently allows smoking in certain public places [restaurants, hotels and airports], in the form of designated smoking areas. We should look at abolishing all designated smoking areas in hotels and restaurants and even airports to ensure a 100% smoke free environment since most of these designated smoking areas are rarely compliant as per COTPA requirements and are actually putting our public at great health risk from exposure to second hand smoke.’’

Designated smoking room

Voluntary Health Association of India, an organisation working for the prevention of tobacco abuse, says designated smoking room has a grave risk of spreading COVID-19.

“COVID-19 is most likely to be spread by smokers, as the act of smoking includes the removal of masks and the fingers [and possibly contaminated cigarettes] in contact with lips, which increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth. COVID-19 infected smokers can spread the virus through floating of contaminated aerosol particles in the air, settling of contaminated particles on objects and surfaces, coughing, sneezing, disposal of contaminated cigarette butts, etc,’’ it said in a release.

It added that the benefit of smoke-free policies would certainly protect non-smokers from the dangerous exposure to tobacco smoke, called second-hand smoke.

Nalini Satyanaraya, health activist, said exposure to passive smoking happened in eateries, specifically hotels, restaurants, bars and restaurants, pubs and clubs, risking the lives of thousands of non-smokers by exposing them to the smoke of cigarettes.

“Designated smoking area that are set up are non-compliant to law and seep the cigarette smoke to non-smoking or common area. The COTPA needs to be amended to not permit smoking on any premises, and make it completely smoke-free in the best interest of public health,’’ she added.

According to information submitted by the Health Ministry in the Lok Sabha recently,₹ 37,33,64,148 had been collected by the government as fines from people for violating thm.

43,2020/10/03,"India, South Africa ask WTO to ease IP rules for COVID-19","The countries argue that without a waiver of some existing safeguards for IPR, some countries would find it hard to access vaccines or medicines quickly.

South Africa and India have asked the World Trade Organization to waive some provisions in the international agreements that regulate intellectual property rights (IPR), to speed up efforts to prevent, treat and contain the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and make sure developing countries are not left behind.

The countries argue, in a joint submission to the Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights dated Friday, that without a rapid waiver of some existing safeguards for intellectual property rights, some countries – particularly developing ones that have been “disproportionately impacted” – would find it hard to access vaccines or medicines quickly.

Narendra Modi praises India’s vaccine developers

Activists have warned that a COVID-19 vaccine could be hoarded by rich countries in a race to inoculate their populations first. Some countries including Britain, France, Germany and the U.S. have ordered hundreds of millions of doses of potential vaccines even before clinical trials have shown they are effective.

Poorer countries, whose economies have been shattered by the pandemic, are not in a position to place such bets. With the world surpassing 1 million confirmed COVID-19 deaths, urgency has grown.

Leena Menghaney, who heads the access campaign in South Asia for international aid group Doctors Without Borders, called it “crucial that other member governments of the WTO support this, as we need to ensure that vaccines, drugs and other medical tools needed for COVID-19 can be scaled up by countries and their manufacturers without facing protracted negotiations for licenses.”

South Africa and India are seeking waivers to rules that relate to copyright, industrial designs, patents and the protection of undisclosed information or trade secrets, and they propose that the waiver be in place “until widespread vaccination is in place globally” and most of the world has developed immunity to the coronavirus.

Fight against COVID-19 clearest example of U.S.-India partnership, says U.S. official

The countries say there are “significant concerns” about whether new treatments and vaccines being developed for COVID-19 would be made available promptly and affordably to meet the global demand.

The letter says the existing flexibilities written into the rules might not be enough, and could result in legal difficulties for developing nations. Countries with a limited capacity to manufacture pharmaceuticals are particularly vulnerable, and this could make the process of importing and exporting medicines “cumbersome and lengthy,” it says.

""Internationally, there is an urgent call for global solidarity, and the unhindered global sharing of technology and know-how in order that rapid responses for the handling of COVID-19 can be put in place on a real time basis,” the letter says. It asks that the council urgently approach the WTO’s high-level decision-making body, the General Council.

India’s government and a spokeswoman for South Africa’s health ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. South Africa has been outspoken in the past about access to treatments, notably affordable drugs for HIV.

Africa’s 54 countries have teamed up during the COVID-19 pandemic to pursue equitable access to any effective vaccine. An African Union communique in June said governments around the world should “remove all obstacles” to any vaccine’s swift and equitable distribution, including by making all intellectual property and technologies immediately available.

The communique specifically mentioned the Doha Declaration on public health by WTO members in 2001, which refers to the right to grant compulsory licenses – where a government can license the use of a patented invention without the consent of the patent-holder.

The African communique, read out after a continental conference on the quest for COVID-19 vaccines, states an urgent need for countries to “make full use of legal measures ... to ensure monopolies do not stand in the way of access.” It points out the “barriers” intellectual property rules have posed in the past to affordable vaccines in developing countries.

Drug companies have said they need to protect their intellectual property to fund their expensive research.

44,2020/10/03,RJD MP moves SC challenging validity of new farm laws,"Mr. Jha, a Rajya Sabha member of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), has filed the plea in the top court through lawyer Fauzia Shakil.

RJD MP Manoj Jha has moved the the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of the newly enacted three agriculture laws, saying they are “discriminatory and manifestly arbitrary” and will expose marginal farmers to exploitation by big corporates.

Parliament has recently passed the three Bills — the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. These have came into effect from September 27 after President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent.

Mr. Jha, a Rajya Sabha member of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), has filed the plea in the top court through lawyer Fauzia Shakil.

Besides Mr. Jha, Congress Lok Sabha member from Kerala TN Prathapan and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Rajya Sabha member from Tamil Nadu Tiruchi Siva had moved the top court against the farm laws.

Mr. Jha, in his plea, said, “The impugned legislations corporatise agriculture and ushers in an unregulated and exploitative regime. A farmer would not have the knowledge to negotiate the best terms with a private company. This leads to unequal bargaining position in negotiating the farm agreement with corporates would lead to corporates monopolising the agriculture sector.”

The plea said the laws have been passed by Parliament “in breach of the Parliamentary Rules and convention and the impugned acts are unconstitutional on the ground that it is discriminatory and manifestly arbitrary and further violates the Basic Structure of the Constitution.”

The Hindu Explains | Who gains and who loses from the farm Bills?

These laws encourage “corporatisation” of Indian agriculture which is the lifeline of the poor farmers and key to the survival of the nation’s agriculture sector, it said.

“The impugned Acts primarily intends to sacrifice the interest of the farmers and leave them at the mercy of the sponsors without any proper dispute resolution mechanism. The Acts provide for ‘farming agreements’ between the farmers (of whom 85% are marginal farmers owning up to 2 acres) and the Corporate entities,” it said.

It is noteworthy that the farmers by way of these legislations are pitted against the corporates with disproportionate bargaining powers, the RJD leader said in the plea.

The price determination mechanism under new laws is only through the agreements between the corporate entities and farmers and do not stipulate that the price should not be below the minimum selling price (MSP) and does not even guarantee the price given by the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), it said.

Instead of the ensuring MSP, the laws intend to corporatise peasant agriculture and erode the existing legal safeguards that prevent direct invasion of rural agriculture market by the monopoly corporate forces, it said.

The laws enable the sponsors to deprive the market committees of their market fee on transaction within the specified Market Yards under the State Mandi Laws, the plea said.

“The farmers currently have the freedom to sell their farm produce to anyone anywhere. The freedom however is not real but is bereft of any safety or guarantees, to protect them against the superior bargaining force of the buyers,” the plea said.

“The Acts have been passed in blatant breach of the principles of federal structure of Constitution as ‘agriculture’ is a state subject under Entry 14 of List II which does not grant competence to the central government to legislate on the issues relating to ‘agriculture’ Only State Legislature have the legislative competence to pass laws dealing with the subject,” it said.

As per the government, the new law intends to provide a national framework for the farming agreements to protect and empower farmers as they engage with agri-business and food processing firms, wholesalers, exporters and large retailers for farm services and sale of produce at a remunerative price framework in a fair and transparent manner.

45,2020/10/03,Previous governments lacked courage to effect farm reforms due to poll-focussed mindset: PM Modi,"Our reforms have troubled those who have always worked for political benefits, says the Prime Minister

Taking a swipe at the opposition’s protest against farm reform laws, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday those parties also had the same idea but lacked the courage to implement these measures because they focussed on elections while his government looked at the country’s and farmers’ welfare.

Addressing his second public meeting after inaugurating Atal Tunnel in Rohtang in Himachal Pradesh, Mr. Modi said those protesting against the laws wanted farmers to live in the previous century, and are now jolted by his government’s attack on middlemen.

The ruling BJP has cited the Congress manifesto for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls to assert that the opposition party had also promised the same laws which the Modi government has enacted to allow farmers to sell their produce outside state-controlled ‘mandi’ but is now criticising them for political reasons.

Mr. Modi also spoke of the benefits of new labour sector laws and said reforms will continue as his government works to realise its goal of “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” (Self-Reliant India), asserting that regulations of the previous century will not work in a new century.

Our reforms have troubled those who have always worked for political benefits, he said, adding that new labour reforms have given women same salary and opportunities as men had so far.

Their mindset remained the same while the century changed, he said, attacking the opposition. “You cant enter the next century with the mindset of the past century,” he said.

Mr. Modi said his government’s reforms, including digitisation of services and direct transfer of money, have saved time and money while rooting out corruption.

The government is constantly trying to reduce problems of the masses, he said.

The prime minister also addressed a public meeting at Sissu village in Lahaul-Spiti region earlier in the day, where he asserted that a major transformation has been effected in the government’s way of functioning and new schemes are no more based on the quantum of votes from an area as the only focus now is ‘development for all’

This was his first public rally in more than six months ever since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic forced a nationwide lockdown in March. People were seated far from each other as per social distancing protocols at both the public meetings.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Union Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur and Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jairam Thakur were also present at the public meetings.

Mr. Singh highlighted the strategic importance of the tunnel, saying it will make soldiers’ deployment and movement of weapons and ration easier.

Earlier in the day, Modi inaugurated the strategically important all-weather Atal Tunnel and lashed out at the Congress-led previous governments, saying strategic projects were neglected and defence interests were compromised for years.

The tunnel, built at a cost of about ₹3,300 crore, is extremely significant from the point of view of the country’s defence.

Built by the Border Roads Organisation, it has been billed as the longest highway tunnel in the world and reduces the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km.

The memorial which has the names of all 20 “Gallants of Galwan” inscribed on it is located at Post 120 in Eastern Ladakh and was inaugurated earlier this week. It details the actions of 16 Bihar and attached troops led by Col. B Santhosh Babu to evict the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Observation Post (OP) from the Y nala (junction) area under Operation Snow Leopard. They successfully evicted the PLA OP from Y nala and reached Patrolling Point 14 where a “fierce skirmish” broke out between the Indian Army and PLA troops, the inscription reads.

“Col. B Santhosh Babu led from the front and his troops fought gallantly in a hand to hand combat, causing heavy casualties to the PLA,” it states.

Post 120 lies along the Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO) road. China has so far not revealed the casualty numbers on its side. A senior government official recently said China, through diplomatic channels, has acknowledged five of its soldiers were killed including a Commanding Officer.

The standoff along the disputed boundary in Ladakh has been ongoing since early May. Several rounds of diplomatic and military talks have failed to reaching an agreement on disengagement and de-escalation.

47,2020/10/03,‘Shaurya’ successfully test fired,"“DRDO officials rate Shaurya as one of the top 10 missiles in the world.”

India on Saturday successfully test fired its indigenously developed nuclear capable hypersonic missile ‘Shaurya’ with a strike range of around 1,000 km from a test range in Odisha, defence sources said.

‘Shaurya’, which is the land variant of Indias K-15 missile, has a strike range of 700 km to 1000 km and is capable of carrying payloads of 200 kg to 1000 kg, the sources said.

The surface-to-surface tactical missile was blasted off from a canister strapped to the ground launcher from launch complex 4 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) in the APJ Abdul Kalam Island around 12.10 pm and covered the desired range, they said.

It is 10 metres long, 74 cm in diameter and weighs 6.2 tonnes. Its two stages use solid propellants.

Describing the trial as successful, the sources said that the state-of-the-art missile performed a manoeuvre in the closing stages of its flight and hit the impact point in the Bay of Bengal with precision and accuracy.

A gas generator at the bottom of the canister pushed the missile out it. Its first stage ignited then and fell off.

The second stage went into action after this, a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) official said.

“During the test flight, the missile was tracked by various telemetry stations and radars and performed well,” he said.

“DRDO officials rate Shaurya as one of the top 10 missiles in the world in its class with its high performance navigation and guidance systems, efficient propulsion systems, sophisticated control technologies and canisterised launch,” sources said.

The missile can be launched from silos and canisters mounted on a truck and fixed on the ground, they said adding that it can be easily moved around. A truck itself can become a launching platform.

‘Shaurya’ missiles can kept in locations where the enemies would not be able to detect them. Besides, it cannot be detected by satellite imaging, the sources said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shaurya-successfully-test-fired/article32759394.ece
48,2020/10/03,Coronavirus | Assam wants stage 2 trial vaccine to be allowed for disbursal,"Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma writes to Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan

Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has asked the Central government to make available any likely vaccine candidate against COVID-19 after validation of stage 2 human trials for front line medical workers at the very least.

Mr. Sarma had written a letter to Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan last month, requesting that regulatory permits for vaccine candidates, being developed in India, be expedited as the challenges of dealing with COVID-19 were mounting.

“We are trying to convince people to abide by COVID-19 norms. The evolving situation is a matter of great concern. I will request the Centre to please allow the vaccine even at stage 2 trials. If you wait for stage 3 trials, the waiting period will be too long. If efficacy is established in stage 2, please allow the vaccine for at least front line staff, and that itself can be the stage 3 trial”, said Mr. Sarma to The Hindu over the telephone. The fact that the disease is currently being treated symptomatically and not aetiologically has weighed on this opinion.

The letter written to Dr. Vardhan clearly states that despite efforts at controlling the spread of the disease, a quick vaccine development and large scale dissemination appears to be the only way to restore a semblance of normalcy to everyday life and the economy.

‘Covaxin’ trial

Mr. Sarma has been at the forefront of Assam’s efforts at COVID-19 control and capacity-building.

49,2020/10/03,Smriti Irani backs Adityanath,"NCW was in touch with Hathras administration to ensure that the victim received help, she says

Amidst the clamour for Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s resignation, Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani stood firmly behind him.

“The Chief Minister has constituted an SIT [special investigation team). I have been informed that action has been taken against the Superintendent of Police of Hathras. I am confident that once the SIT report is out, Yogiji will act against all those who interfered or because of whom there was a conspiracy to ensure that the victim doesn’t get justice”, Ms. Irani said at a press conference in Varanasi.

The National Commission for Women (NCW) was in touch with the district administration from the beginning to ensure that the victim received help, she noted.

Sees politics on issue

The Minister also lashed out at Opposition leaders. “People understand well the tactics deployed by Congress and that is why they ensured the BJP’s victory in 2019. If any political party or any politician wants to do politics on any issue, then in a democracy I can’t stop them. But their interest in Hathras is for their politics and not for justice”.

It was under the BJP government that disbursal of funds to the States under the Nirbhaya Fund took place. Efforts to ensure that every district in the country had a ‘One Stop Centre’ commenced in 2017 and today this goal had been achieved. “Under the Modi government, ₹9,000 crore has been allocated to States from the Nirbhaya Fund. For the first time in the country's history there are women help desks at every police station. Nearly 55 lakh women have been helped through Women Helplines”, she asserted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ozug64/article32758774.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SMRITIIRANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/smriti-irani-backs-adityanath/article32758776.ece
50,2020/10/03,"Hathras gang rape | Rahul, Priyanka meet victim’s family","Will ensure justice for family, says former Congress chief.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said on Saturday that no power could silence the voice of the family of the Hathras gang rape victim.

Addressing presspersons after meeting the family at Boolagarhi village, Mr. Gandhi said, “We stand with the family members in their hour of grief and continue to fight against injustice.”

Hathras gang rape | Yogi Adityanath recommends CBI probe

He said the U.P. CM should understand his responsibility and said the Congress was determined to get justice to the family of the victim.

Mr. Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, accompanied by senior party leaders K.C. Venugopal, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and P.L. Punia, spent almost an hour with the bereaved family.

‘Govt. must answer’

In a tweet late in the evening, Ms. Vadra said the victim’s family had demanded a Supreme Court-monitored judicial inquiry and asked why their daughter’s body had been burnt using petrol without their permission.

The family also wanted the Disrict Magistrate of Hathras to be suspended. Ms. Vadra added that the family had a right to know the truth and the Uttar Pradesh government must answer them.

Family sources said Ms. Vadra had embraced the victim’s mother and wiped her tears. The victim’s father told the Congress delegation that the District Magistrate had threatened them. He also voiced his fears about their security as the relatives of the men accused of the assault are threatening to hold a caste panchayat in the village.

Clash with police

Earlier, the Congress leaders were stopped at Noida’s DND flyover by the Uttar Pradesh police. Hundreds of Congress workers, including at least two dozen party MPs, were present on DND as Ms. Vadra drove to Hathras. Police officials told them that ban orders under Section 144 of the Cr.PC were in place and their visit would be a violation of the Epidemic Act. Additional Commissioner of Police (Law & Order) of Gautam Buddh Nagar, Love Kumar, said the large number of party workers had led to a traffic jam.

“When the Congress leaders persisted with their demand, they were allowed to go to Hathras in a group of five,” Mr. Kumar said, adding that unlike October 1 there was no order to stop political leaders from proceeding to Hathras.

The police decision to permit only five persons to proceed led to confusion among the Congress workers leading to a lathi charge by the U.P. Police to control the situation. Former Bharaich MP Kamal Kishore and Delhi Congress President Anil Choudhary were among those facing police ire.

Ms Vadra then stepped out of her car and caught hold of a policeman’s baton. She could be heard asking the police not to hit party workers. She also explained the situation to the party workers and asked them to return, before driving on. Mr Gandhi was also seen climbing atop an SUV and telling party men to return after the permission was granted.

Denying Ms Vadra was manhandled, Mr Kumar said Ms. Vadra and Mr. Gandhi helped to calm the party workers but some “over-excited” workers broke the barricade and pushed the policemen. “We will take legal action,” he said.

Senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters Mr Gandhi had offered to go alone two days back. “But the UP Police stopped him.” He described the lathi charge as the “dictatorial” attitude of the State government.

Congress spokespersons on Randeep Surjewala said “Mr Adityanath’s lathis and cycle of repression wouldn't be able to suppress Congress and its appeal for justice for the victim”.

Officials meet family

Earlier on Saturday, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi and Hitesh Chandra Awasthi, DGP U.P. met the family of the victim in Boolagarhi and assured strict action against the culprits. Later, at a press conference in Hathras, Mr Awasthi said public representatives would be allowed to visit the Hathras victim's village provided they come in a group of five persons. He said SIT would consider all aspects raised by the family and security in the village would be increased.

Asked on whose order the victim was cremated in the dead of night on September 30, Mr H.C. Awashti said, “It was the decision of the local administration.”

After two days, the media was allowed to enter the village on Saturday. Joint magistrate Prem Prakash Meena said the media was stopped because the SIT investigation was on and four policemen had developed COVID like symptoms.

During the day, the brothers of the victim collected the ashes of their sister from the cremation ground. “We are still not sure whether these are ashes our sister but for the sake of humanity, we have collected them. We will immerse them only after she get justice,” said the younger of the two.

He said they put up questions to the senior-most officials of the state government, including the role of the district magistrate in the “forcible” cremation of their sister.

DM Praveen Laxkar was however, not present at Hathras. Vineet Jaiswal who took charge as Hathras Superintendent of Police on Saturday accompanied the senior officials.

He said public representatives should be allowed to meet the family, provided they follow rules laid down by the administration during COVID 19. He said public officials were the “face of the system” and should “not step back” from “facing the anger” of the public.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1l1qs/article32762951.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HATHRASjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rahul-gandhi-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-visit-hathras/article32758669.ece
51,2020/10/03,"Bodies of 3 Rajouri youth exhumed, handed over to families: police","They were passed off as unidentified militants after an encounter in Shopian’s Amshipora on July 18

The bodies of three civilians from Rajouri, who were passed off as unidentified militants after an encounter in Shopian’s Amshipora on July 18, were exhumed and handed over to their families in Baramulla on Saturday morning

“The bodies were exhumed at 8 a.m. in the presence of a magistrate and the families. The bodies have been handed over to the legal heirs,” Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar told The Hindu.

The exhumation took place at Baramulla’s Gantamulla, 70 days after the youth’s burial, held 235 km away from Rajouri.

The police investigation is yet to establish any link of the slain youth with militants. According to the families, the youth were working as labourers in Kashmir and were on their way to Rajouri when they went missing on July 18.

The youth from Pir Panjal valley’s Rajouri were identified as Abrar Ahmed, 25; Imtiyaz Ahmed, 20, and Mohammed Ibrar, 16. On September 25, the DNA samples of the slain youth matched the family members.

The police have arrested two locals, including a Special Police Officer from Poonch, so far. They are accused of “tipping off about the presence of militants in the area.”

The Army has already initiated disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima facie answerable. The police, in a statement on July 18, had claimed that they recovered “incriminating material, including arms and ammunition, at the site of the encounter”.

The families identified the bodies from the photographs taken at the time of burial.

“We have lost dear member of our family. The wounds inflicted by his killing are unforgettable. We hope those who perpetrated the crime will be given stern and exemplary punishment,” a relative of victim Abrar said.

The regional political parties also expressed shock. “Three able bodied athletic men trek 80 km in search of livelihood. And a few months later the parents take their violently ravaged bodies back. Imagine the plight of the parents,” Peoples Conference chief Sajad Lone said.

J&K Apni Party vice president Choudhary Zulfikar Ali said, “The justice to the victim families will not be complete until the accused are punished and delivering justice will also work as deterrence for the elements in the forces so that they do not repeat such incidents.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/71s8bh/article32640706.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHOPIANENCOUNTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bodies-of-3-rajouri-youth-exhumed-handed-over-to-families-police/article32758602.ece

53,2020/10/03,Lockdown moratorium | Loans up to ₹2 crore may get relief,"Banks will suffer a loss of ₹6 lakh crore in case of complete waiver to all borrowers, says affidavit

The Centre has informed the Supreme Court that it will continue to “hand-hold” small and vulnerable borrowers and waive the compound interest (interest on interest) accumulated against their loans during the six-month moratorium period.

The waiver of compound interest is only applicable for loans up to ₹2 crore, an additional affidavit filed by the Ministry of Finance told the Supreme Court.

The relief of waiver of compound interest during the six-month moratorium will be for MSME, education, housing, consumer durables, credit card, auto, personal and consumption loans, all up to ₹2 crore.

“The government has decided to continue to hand-hold the small borrowers,” the affidavit said.

The government made it clear that “any individual or entity whose loan amount is more than ₹2 crore will not be eligible for waiver of compounding of interest”.

The 20-odd page affidavit reasoned that banks would suffer a loss of ₹6 lakh crore if the government agreed to a complete waiver of loans to all borrowers of all categories for the entire moratorium.

“It would wipe out the substantial and major part of the banks’ net worth, rendering most of them unviable,” the Ministry said.

A blanket waiver across the spectrum would “raise a very serious question mark over their (banks) very survival”.

Even for the State Bank of India, a sweeping waiver would wipe out over half its net worth accumulated over nearly 65 years of its existence.

“The only solution is for the government to bear the burden of waiver of compound interest,” the government said categorically.

It said even this limited waiver may have an impact on “pressing commitments to the nation, including meeting direct costs associated with pandemic management, addressing basic needs of common man” and so on.

Not a ‘waiver’

The government reasoned that ‘moratorium’ never meant ‘waiver’. It only had meant ‘deferment’.

“Borrowers had understood the difference between waiver and deferment of payment of instalments for that loan — therefore a majority of borrowers did not take the moratorium. More than 50% of the borrowers did not avail of the moratorium,” the government said.

Most importantly, payment of interest to depositors was essential for banking. Small depositors, pensioners, etc. survive on the interest from their deposits.

Going any further than a limited waiver would be detrimental to the overall economic scenario.

“Jobs need to be safeguarded and every attempt made to bring back economic growth. Use of public resources for any one category of stakeholders must be carefully calibrated. Unintended consequences can arise and financial stability itself could be imperilled,” the affidavit cautioned.

On concerns addressed in court about the downgrading of loan accounts from ‘Standard’ to ‘Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), the government said the resolution framework announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) provides that loan accounts which slip into NPAs between invocation and implementation may be upgraded as ‘Standard’ on the date of implementation itself.

The government assuaged apprehensions that credit rating may record a downgrade to NPA for defaults during the moratorium. It said the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had already issued a circular on March 30 providing for relaxation from recognition of default due to the moratorium.

A second circular on August 31 has buttressed the earlier assurance. In future, the government would engage with the SEBI in this regard for a “holistic and humane view in resolving issues”.

The government touched upon requests for further relief and regulatory dispensation for businesses other than MSME. The Centre said several steps had been taken in this regard, including the suspension of crucial provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code from March 25, the first day of the pandemic lockdown.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/8yzoge/article31197738.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDEXNEWCURRENCY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/will-waive-compound-interest-for-loans-up-to-2-crore-govt-informs-supreme-court/article32758208.ece
54,2020/10/03,World’s longest highway tunnel opened in Himachal Pradesh,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi says Atal Tunnel will strengthen border infrastructure, slams Congress for delay.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday inaugurated the Atal Tunnel at Rohtang at an altitude of above 3,000 metres in Himachal Pradesh. After the inauguration, he said the tunnel would provide new strength to the country’s border infrastructure.

The 9.02 km-long-tunnel, built by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), is the world’s longest highway tunnel and connects Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley. It provides all-weather connectivity to the landlocked valley of Lahaul-Spiti, which remains cut-off for nearly six months in a year as the Rohtang Pass is uually snow-bound between November and April.

Before the tunnel construction, the Lahaul Valley used to remain closed for vehicular movement due to bad weather conditions. But

Thanks to the tunnel, the people of the Valley will have round-the-year road connectivity. The tunnel reduces the distance by 46 km between Manali and Leh and the travel time by about 4 to 5 hours. It is expected to boost tourism and winter sports in the region. The tunnel, also significant from the military logistics viewpoint, will provide better connectivity to the armed forces in reaching Ladakh.

In 2019, The Union Cabinet decided to name the tunnel as ‘Atal Tunnel’ to honour former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for his contributions. The decision was taken in 2000 when he was the Prime Minister. The foundation stone was laid by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi on June 28, 2010.

PM attacks Congress

Mr. Modi accused the Congress-led previous governments of not paying heed to border development projects, thereby compromising the nation’s security interests. “Projects related to improved border connectivity either never came out of the planning stage or those which did, got delayed or stuck. The same happened with Atal Tunnel,” he said.

“In 2002, Atalji laid the foundation stone for the approach road of this tunnel and after his government was gone, it seemed that work on this tunnel was forgotten. The situation was like that till 2013-2014; work done on the tunnel was only up to 1,300 metres (1.5 km). Experts say that had the work on the tunnel continued at the same pace, it would have been completed perhaps in year 2040”, said Mr. Modi in a veiled attack on the Congress-led UPA governments.

“It was after 2014 that unprecedented pace was given to the project. Every problem faced by the BRO was resolved. The result was that while earlier 300-metre tunnel work was being accomplished every year, it reached 1,400 metres a year. In six years, we completed the work of 26 years,” he said.

‘Economic loss’

Mr. Modi said the delay in completion of key infrastructure-related projects such as the ‘Atal Tunnel’ would only harm the country’s interests. “The delay not just causes inconvenience to people but the country also has to bear the loss on economic front. In 2005, the estimated cost of this tunnel was projected at ₹950 crore, but due to continuous delay, the tunnel has now been completed after spending over ₹3,200 crore,” he noted.

There was a direct relationship between connectivity and the country’s development. “More connectivity means more development. Especially in border areas, the development of connectivity is related to the nation’s security needs. But unfortunately, the seriousness surrounding the connectivity of border development was never shown by previous governments due to lack of strong political will,” he stated.

Just like the ‘Atal Tunnel’, many other important projects across the country had been ignored for long. “In Ladhak’s Daulat Beg Oldi, the airstrip, which is strategically very important, was closed for over 40-50 years. What was the compulsion? What was the pressure? I don’t want to go into details... The truth is that it was due to the strong will of the Air Force that the airstrip started to operate, and there was no ‘political will’ seen behind it,” he said.

“There had been several other such projects that were very important from security and convenience point of view, but for several years they were ignored by previous regimes... these projects were of not just of strategic importance but would have ushered in economic prosperity as well. However, in the last six years, the situation has started to rapidly change. Specially, for connectivity development in the border areas, we have been working with full force. In the Himalayan region- be it Himachal Pradesh, Jammu-Kashmir, Kargil, Leh-Ladhak, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, dozens of such projects have been completed and work on several other projects is being done,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r5knmx/article32757823.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI03-10-2020000027BTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-modi-inaugurates-atal-tunnel-at-rohtang/article32757824.ece

Hundreds of citizens, student groups, activists and politicians gathered at Jantar Mantar on Friday evening demanding justice for the Hathras gang rape and murder case victim. The protesters demanded Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s resignation alleging increased violence against women and atrocities against Dalits in the State.

U.S. President Donald Trump moved to a military hospital for treatment on Friday after being diagnosed with COVID-19 as his administration and re-election campaign scrambled to adjust to an extraordinary twist in his turbulent presidency.

Senior BJP leader Uma Bharati, currently undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at the AIIMS in Rishikesh, on Friday urged Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to allow media persons and leaders of political parties to meet the family of the deceased Hathras rape victim.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India had “broken its inertia” in vaccine development after 2014 and had introduced four new vaccines into the country’s immunisation programme. “This included an indigenously developed rotavirus vaccine. Recently, we also gave market authorisation for an indigenously developed pneumococcal vaccine,” he said, addressing an online conference of scientists of Indian origin on Friday.

The recently passed Code on Social Security, the Industrial Relations Code and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, which along with the Code on Wages, 2019 subsume 29 labour laws into four codes, were passed after widespread consultations, says Union Labour and Employment Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar.

Ten Central trade unions will observe a nationwide general strike on November 26 to protest against the recent labour laws cleared by Parliament. This was decided at a virtual national convention of the unions and other independent federations held on Friday to coincide with Gandhi Jayanti.

With the first phase of the Assembly poll in Bihar less than a month away on October 28, a seat-sharing deal is said to have been finalised in the opposition mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) on Friday. Leaders of alliance partners are likely to officially announce the formula this weekend.

Among all the States, Bihar, which goes to polls on October 28, ranks the lowest on Human Development Index. The Index measures a State's performance along three dimensions: living a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and educated, and having a decent standard of living. Whether it is in the share of schools with girls' toilets or population served by a government doctor, Bihar holds the poorest record by a wide margin.

56,2020/10/03,Declare dates for Bengal civic polls: BJP,"The elections are seen as a litmus test for the TMC and the BJP ahead of the 2021 State polls

The West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has approached the State Election Commission (SEC) seeking declaration of the dates for elections to 107 municipalities and corporations, which have been put off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“In many cases, elections are due for more than a year. Local bodies are now run by administrators appointed by the government. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation is one such case,” the BJP said in its letter to the SEC.

The letter said the “Supreme Court in an order dated September 22, 2020, has sought your opinion on how soon the pending election can be conducted” and “High Court of Calcutta opined that the pending elections should be held as soon as possible”. Referring to the existing provision where the SEC is responsible for the “superintendence, direction and control” and conduct of elections in the State, the letter said there “is a travesty in the Act about the responsibility of fixing the date of elections”.

The letter stated, “While the State government is empowered by the Act to finalise the dates of local body elections, the SEC is obligated to conduct the election and carry out the responsibility of fulfilling the democratic process. But unless the State government initiates the process, the SEC remains a lame duck.”

The party’s attempt to put pressure on the SEC comes after the State is opening up different sectors and the announcement of the Bihar Assembly poll dates. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) leadership has maintained that they are prepared to contest the polls, including the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, whenever they are held.

59,2020/10/03,Jagan to launch Vidya Kanuka on Oct. 5,"Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy will distribute school kits to students at a school in Kankipadu on October 5 as part of Jagananna Vidya Kanuka programme, according to Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh.

The Minister was speaking after inspecting the Kankipadu Zilla Parishad High School and Model Primary School on Friday. He was accompanied by coordinator for government programmes T. Raghuram, Principal Secretary, School Education, B. Rajasekhar, Penamaluru MLA Kolusu Parthasaradhy, Krishna District Collector A.Md. Imtiaz, Joint Collector (Revenue) K. Madhavilatha and Joint Collector (Development) L. Sivasankar.

Mr. Suresh said Mr. Jagan would inspect the works taken up under the Nadu-Nedu programme at Kankipdu school before formally inaugurating the Vidya Kanuka scheme. He said the many educational schemes launched by the government were aimed at strengthening the education system and impart quality education to children of all sections in society.

Referring to the Nadu-Nedu programme, he said the face of the government schools would completely change under this scheme. The focus was on development of infrastructure to make schools a happy place to spend for children. The programme was being implemented in three phases and at the end of it all, the stark difference between the school buildings and the facilities around in the past and now would be seen.

The government now was also keen on extending this programme to junior and degree colleges and give them a facelift, he said.

The Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team set up in the district is fully geared up to meet any security threat, Prakasam Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal said.

Leading a strenous training session at the firing range in Chimakurthy on Friday, Mr. Kaushal said the team, modelled along the lines of the National Security Guards (NSG) and the Organisation for Counter-Terrorist Operations (OCTOPUS), had been raised, trained, and deployed entirely within the district for urban warfare and high-risk operations.

Mr. Kaushal said the SWAT team is the first of its kind to be set up anywhere in the country, and thanked Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Director General of Police Gautam D. Sawang for their support to the initiative.

“New fighting tactics and strategies have been introduced to keep the elite force in fine fettle,” he said after assessing their preparedness to face heightened security threats, including insurgency, and ability to discharge their duties in challenging times.

68,2020/10/03,"Bypolls: Decision on candidates on Sunday, says DKS","‘Party will consider opinion of local leaders’

President of the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) D.K. Shivakumar has said that the decision on Congress candidates for the bypolls to Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar Legislative Assembly constituencies will be taken on Sunday.

After launching a membership drive of the Youth Congress in Hubballi on Saturday, Mr. Shivakumar told presspersons that there were several aspirants. “The party has set up a committee, led by the former Minister Ramalinga Reddy, to take a decision on the issue. We will take a final decision after Sunday’s meeting,” he said.

Regarding reports about Congress considering the name of Kusuma Ravi, wife of late IAS officer D.K. Ravi, for ticket to contest in Rajarajeshwarinagar, he said discussions were still on. Later in Belagavi, he said several senior Congress leaders had favoured her candidature.

“Around seven to eight MLAs and former Ministers have suggested her name. Her father, Hanumantharayappa, was in the Congress, but left it for some reasons. I am, however, yet to speak to her or to other persons concerned about this issue. The party has also not taken a final decision on this matter as there are eight to 10 aspirants,” he said.

He said that a “multi-layered system” had been created to gather opinions of party workers and leaders on such issues. “First, Congress leaders in Bengaluru such as Mr. Reddy will hold a meeting of local workers and seek their opinions. Then they will update me. I will discuss that with State-level leaders and elected representatives of the party. A final decision will be taken after that, in consultation with the high command,” he said.

A similar system will be followed to decide the candidate in Sira. The opinion of local leaders would be discussed at the State level and sent to Delhi for approval, he said.

Flood relief

Earlier in the day while speaking to presspersons after visiting the party office in Dharwad, Mr. Shivakumar lambasted the State government for its failure to take up flood relief measures and compensate farmers for the loss they had suffered.

He said the government was yet to release compensation for the crop loss suffered during last year’s floods and this year the Union Finance Minister had already expressed her helplessness on the issue.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/d8bv9p/article32762896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGSHIVAKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bypolls-decision-on-candidates-on-sunday-says-dks/article32762897.ece
69,2020/10/03,"Former VC on AIIMS advisory body, chosen as CSIR-Emeritus Scientist","Recognition has come to him over his contribution to the field of biological sciences and development of science, says K.S. Rangappa

Former Vice-Chancellor and scientist K.S. Rangappa has been nominated to the top advisory body of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has chosen him as a member of AIIMS PGIMER in Chandigarh and AIIMS in Bhubaneswar, Bathinda, Guwahati and Srinagar.

Speaking to reporters here on Saturday, Prof. Rangappa said the nomination for a period of five years had been made in recognition of his contribution to the field of biological sciences and development of science in the country.

“Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has appreciated my research work and publications, particularly on cancer drug research, in various journals and my work as the chairman of the Indian Science Congress. The AIIMS is a prestigious central institution and I have been nominated to offer my opinion on research and other areas of science,” he said.

The former V-C of University of Mysore said he has been selected as CSIR-Emeritus Scientist (ES) by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), New Delhi. “The CSIR-ES scheme was launched to recognise and encourage meritorious scientists who are above the age of 62. I believe it’s an honour for the University of Mysore to have a CSIR-Emeritus Scientist on its campus.”

COVID-19 vaccine race

On the COVID-19 vaccine race, Prof. Rangappa, who is into cancer research, said several vaccine candidates are in various clinical evaluation stages and some are undergoing clinical trials in India, China and Europe.

Usually, a vaccine takes at least two years to be available considering the evaluation processes involved in its development. In the case of COVID-19, which is spreading rapidly with a high transmission rate, many top-rated universities and research institutions have expedited their vaccine development and some are said to be close to achieving a breakthrough, the scientist explained.

A time-frame for availability of the vaccine cannot be fixed as it has to go through various trials before it is made available, he said, adding that the vaccine development has not been slowed down as seeming as researchers are moving thoughtfully to ensure no side-effects of the vaccine are felt on normal human health.

On cancer research with China

About his research collaboration with China, the former VC said he had entered into an understanding with a Chinese University which wanted to conduct clinical trials on six of his patents pertaining to cancer research. The mega research project had been kept in abeyance after the COVID-19 outbreak despite more than 10 video conference sessions between scientists from India and China on the project so far.

To a question on whether he would pursue the project in the wake of strained relations between India and China, he said, “The project has not taken off yet. It is in a deferment mode. It will be pursued only if the relations are good since my country is my priority and I will comply with what the laws say.”

‘Wake-up call’

The COVID-19 pandemic has come as a wake-up call for India to step up its funding to research, especially in science, as United States, China, South Korea and others set aside huge research grants in field of research and development.

Mr. Rangappa, while welcoming the National Education Policy (NEP), said India spends 0.69 per cent of its GDP on research while it is 4 per cent in Israel, 3 per cent in United States, and 4.5 percent in South Korea. “The allocation is very less for a thickly populated country like ours. The NEP has laid emphasis on research but there is no clarity on the extent of funding the area should get. As a scientist, I suggest India spends more on research like others since the pandemic has come as a lesson for all us,” he opined.

He said the NEP will help to erase discrepancies in the education sector and provide ample opportunities to the people from the deprived sections of the society for accessing quality education.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/former-vc-on-aiims-advisory-body-chosen-as-csir-emeritus-scientist/article32762745.ece

71,2020/10/03,Congress no longer giving positions on basis of recommendation: D.K. Shivakumar,"Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar has said that the Congress in Karnataka had put an end to granting positions in the party through recommendations and would be identifying and grooming new-generation leaders.

Launching the Youth Congress Membership Campaign at R.N. Shetty Kalyan Mantap here on Saturday, Mr. Shivakumar said the focus was on building a cadre-based party now and all the activities and works of the office-bearers, from the booth level to the leaders, were being documented. “If any party member has to get a position, his or her work and sacrifice will be considered, and it will be decided through an internal election. As per the vision of the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, if the country has to survive and prosper, more representation should be given to students, youngsters and women,” he said.

The KPCC president said that in order to strengthen the organisation of the party from the booth level, a mobile application — Praja Pratinidhi — was being developed and tested on a pilot basis in his constituency. “From the booth level, one can get various positions. Politics is like agriculture. If and only when one works at various levels can one get the crop named position. We have dropped the tradition of appointments through recommendations. At the booth level, a ‘digital youth’ will be appointed,” he said.

Mr. Shivakumar also said the party was where it was because of too much “individual worship”. “From here onwards, only those who do party worship will survive. From activists to leaders, the focus should be on strengthening the organisation. One should be a member and organiser first, and then a leader,” he said.

Taking a dig at the BJP, Mr. Shivakumar said that Hindutva was not any one person’s property; it was the property of the nation. “The country has more statues of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar than of Lord Sri Ram because he was the voice of the oppressed who were exploited and ill-treated for centuries. Now, the people of the country have started raising their voice against governments. If at all the Constitution of India has to be protected, agitation is inevitable. And everyone should be ready to fight,” he said.

Referring to the changing times and the need for the party to change, Mr. Shivakumar called on leaders and members to be amidst the people and become their voice. “Only those become the voice of the people will become leaders.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9u1aco/article32762492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGHUBDKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-no-longer-giving-positions-on-basis-of-recommendation-dk-shivakumar/article32762493.ece

The drive entails the MCC staff pitching camps in different areas of a particular ward and collecting the property tax at people’s doorsteps rather than the payee going to the MCC zonal offices.

This also comes during the COVID-19 pandemic which is discouraging public to go to government offices as they risk contracting the virus.

The drive was launched in Ward Number 58 by Chamundeshwari MLA G.T. Deve Gowda who said property tax was a major source of revenue for the MCC to provide basic civic amenities to the public and take up additional works to ramp up infrastructure. The authorities have extended the last date to pay the property tax for the current financial year 2020-21, to October 31 after which the owners will be liable to pay penalty for delayed remittance of the tax.

Though the MCC has already introduced the online system of property tax payment, it enjoins on the property owners to make a visit to the zonal offices of the corporation once to procure their new property ID number which has been introduced after conducting a property survey. From next year people need not visit the MCC office and can pay the tax online as they know the property ID number.

“We are planning such a drive in different wards of the city during the pandemic time so that people need not visit the MCC office to procure the property ID or pay the tax. This is also an effort to make more people tax compliant and bring them under the tax net as there are many owners who have defaulted on tax payment’’, said Gurudutt Hegde, Commissioner, MCC.

There are nearly 1.75 lakh registered properties within the MCC limits and the corporation has a target of collecting nearly ₹140 crore for the financial year 2020-21. The MCC has reached the 50 per cent mark and has collected nearly ₹ 71.4 crore so far from 96,475 property owners, said Mr. Hegde.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mcc-launches-property-tax-collection-drive-to-augment-revenue/article32760828.ece
77,2020/10/03,Dasara jumbos’ mahouts test negative to COVID-19,"They have been told not to venture out of the palace premises and socialise with the public

All 19 Dasara elephants’ staff members, including the mahouts and kavadis, have tested negative to COVID-19 on Saturday, bringing relief to the forest authorities here.

After initial resistance to the test arguing that they were confined to their jungle camps all these days and the test was needless, they later agreed to give their swabs for the test which was arranged on the palace premises by a team from the Department of Health and Family Welfare.

Deputy Conservator of Forest Alexander told The Hindu that 15 mahouts and kavadis of Abhimanyu, Vikrama, Gopi, Cauvery and Vijaya and other caretakers underwent the rapid antigen test (RAT) as a precautionary measure and all of them tested negative. They were a bit apprehensive to take the test but were later persuaded since the test was mandatory as per the government’s guidelines.

The DCF said the mahouts and kavadis have been told not to leave the palace premises and take proper precautions as they have a big task to accomplish with only a few days left for the festivities to commence. “We have told them not to socialise with the public and comply with the safety precautions over the pandemic.”

Senior forest veterinarian Nagaraj said all elephants are in good health and their training commenced from Saturday. After a few days of walk within the palace premises, weight training using sand bags and wooden howdah will be conducted, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/398b2r/article32762724.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03MYSJUMBO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dasara-jumbos-mahouts-test-negative-to-covid-19/article32759673.ece
78,2020/10/03,Many support candidature of D.K. Ravi’s wife: DKS,"Final decision on Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly seat yet to be taken, says KPCC chief

Several senior Congress leaders have favoured fielding Kusuma Ravi, widow of former IAS officer D.K. Ravi, as party candidate for the Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly seat, KPCC president D.K. Shivakumar said in Belagavi on Saturday.

“Around 7-8 MLAs and former Ministers have suggested her name. Her father Hanumantharayappa was in the Congress, but left it for some reasons. Those supporting her nomination say that she is a housewife who has gone through a lot of trauma and is not aware of such political developments. However, I am yet to speak to her or to other persons concerned about this issue. Neither has the party taken any final decision on this matter, as there are 8-10 aspirants,’’ he said.

“I have created a multi-layered system to gather opinions of party workers and leaders on such issues. First, Congress leaders in Bengaluru such as Ramalinga Reddy will hold a meeting of local workers and seek their opinions. Then they will send it to me. I will discuss it with State-level leaders and elected representatives of the party. A final decision will be taken after that, in consultation with the high command,’’ he said.

A similar system will be followed to decide on the candidate in Sira. The opinion of local leaders will be discussed at the State level and sent to Delhi for approval.

Mr. Shivakumar said that he was surprised about TV channels targeting actresses and women in the entertainment and media industry, alleging that they had links to the drug mafia, while leaving out men in the film industry. I am also surprised why only the entertainment industry is targeted,’’ he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/many-support-candidature-of-dk-ravis-wife-dks/article32759563.ece
79,2020/10/03,Abduction of Nanjangud beggar’s daughter sparks fresh probe into child trafficking,"Police questioning suspects, checking CCTV footage

The abduction of a beggar’s three-year-old daughter in Nanjangud earlier this week, about four years after her elder son was similarly kidnapped from the pavement near the Srikanteshwara Temple, has set the police on the path of a fresh investigation into a possible case of child trafficking.

The investigation into the abduction of Parvathi’s eight-month-old son in April 2016 had helped the police uncover a well-organised child trafficking racket, which also involved sale of new-borns from two private maternity hospitals in Mysuru to childless couples.

In her complaint to the Nanjangud police, Parvathi said she was approached by an unidentified man on Thursday asking her to give away her daughter to a childless couple. Minutes after she reproached the stranger and threw away the currency note he handed to her, Parvathi found her daughter missing. She lodged a complaint after she was unable to locate her.

Refusing to rule out the involvement of child traffickers in the abduction, the Nanjangud police’s investigation also involves looking for the whereabouts of the accused involved in the 2016 case in which a chargesheet had been filed and trial is under way.

The trial has not been continuing in view of the impact of COVID-19 on the courts. A special team has been formed to check the whereabouts of the accused, said Deputy Superintendent of Nanjangud police Prabhakar Rao Shinde.

According to preliminary investigation, the unidentified man was brought to the complainant by a local tea seller. “We have not arrested anybody, but are questioning the suspects and checking the CCTV footages”, he said.

Meanwhile, Parvathi’s elder son, who had been kidnapped in 2016, had been rescued along with 15 other trafficked children. Most of the other trafficked children had been sold from the maternity hospitals in Mysuru where unwed mothers had been brought for delivery.

Mysuru District Child Protection Officer S. Diwakar said the elder son of Parvathi was now in their custody in a children’s home. Though a DNA test had proved that Parvathi was his biological mother, he was not handed over to her as Parvathi was unable to convince the authorities that she would be able to provide food and shelter to him.

The Women and Child Welfare authorities had asked Parvathi to even entrust to the authorities her daughter, who had been kidnapped on Thursday. “Such children are vulnerable to abduction and trafficking”, Mr. Diwakar said.

Even though the trafficked children and the caregivers to whom they had been sold had developed a bond, the law did not recognise the same as the children had not been adopted in the legal manner.

After an elaborate rescue of the trafficked children, two of them were handed back to their biological mothers while six others were given in legal adoption to childless couples who had registered themselves for adoption as per the guidelines of the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), functioning under the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development. Caregivers managed to secure the custody of three children through court orders while the others who had not been put up for adoption remain in different children’s homes in view of the visitation rights the caregivers had secured through courts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/abduction-of-nanjangud-beggars-daughter-sparks-fresh-probe-into-child-trafficking/article32758824.ece

Another section depicts the worship tradition of divine ‘Gauri’ and is titled ‘Gauri Sejje’.

Starting from the lunar month of ‘Shravana’ until the end of ‘Karteeka’, every Tuesday is dedicated to the worship of one of 16 Gauris.

16 Gauris

Swarna Gauri, Arka Gauri, Tintrinee Gauri, Trilochana Gauri, Mauna Gauri, Angushthaa Gauri, Sandoha Gauri, Keshabandhana Gauri, Poorna Gauri, Kapittha Gauri, Saubhagya Gauri, Bruhad Gauri, Upang Lalita Gauri, Kunda Gauri, Badari Gauri and Karteeka Gauri - these are the sixteen forms of Gauri as narrated and compiled by Mummadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar III in his famous compendium, Sritattvanidhi. In fact, many communities perform this ‘vrata’ of worshiping sixteen Gauris, the organisers stated in a release here.

Celebrating milestones

81,2020/10/03,Hasanamba festival to see limited entry this year,"Hassan district administration is contemplating a simple Hasanamba Jatra Mahotsava this year with no entry of the public to Hasanamba Temple, in Hassan city. The festival is to be held between November 5 and 17.

The annual affair usually attracts lakhs of people from across the State.

However, this year, the administration is expected to limit the event for religious ceremonies to the first day and last day of the festival.

Hassan Deputy Commissioner R. Girish, speaking to presspersons on Friday, said the final decision on holding the event would be taken after holding a meeting with K. Gopalaiah, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies and in-charge of the district.

Social distancing

“It would be difficult to maintain physical distance if devotees are allowed to visit the temple as it was done earlier. Considering the COVID-19 situation, we are thinking of holding religious ceremonies on the first and last days of the festival. On the remaining days, the priests will hold regular pujas,” the officer said.

82,2020/10/03,Hunger strike against ‘anti-farmer’ policies,"Former Minister Kimmane Rathnakar staged a hunger strike in front of the taluk office of Tirthahalli in Shivamogga district on Friday, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, opposing the recent laws concerning the farming sector.

He began the protest after offering flowers to portraits of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri.

Addressing the gathering, Mr. Rathnakar said both the Union and State governments had been engaged in implementing anti-farmer policies. Both governments had no concern for the farming community. With the implementation of the new laws, the farmers would lose their land gradually. Similarly, they would also lose right over their produce with a law weakening the APMCs, he said.

Further, he alleged that the people in power had no respect for Mahatma Gandhi. Those in power had been in glorifying Nathuram Godse, the person who killed Mahatma Gandhi. “The people of the country will teach the BJP a lesson for its anti-farmer and anti-poor policies,” he added.

Another protest

The District Congress Committee also staged a protest against the controversial law in Shivamogga. Workers of the party took out a protest march from the party’s office to the Deputy Commissioner’s office. Along the protest march, they raised slogans against the Centre and State government. They submitted a memorandum addressed to the President to the DC.

84,2020/10/03,Vehicle registrations on the upswing in Karnataka,"440% increase in State from April to Aug.; however, only 220 buses were registered during the period

The Transport Department, which saw its revenue drop during the months that Bengaluru and other parts of the State were under lockdown on account of COVID-19, is finally showing signs of recovery. This is reflected in the registration of new vehicles, which increased by 440% across Karnataka from April to August.

When lockdown rules were strictly in force, only 17,188 new vehicles were registered in April. This doubled in May to 37,851, but still remained low. However, registrations rose considerably to 92,291in June, and 93,847 in August.

“In August, the department managed to achieve 78% of the revenue target fixed by the State government. Every month, we have a target of ₹551 crore,” said Transport Commissioner N. Shivkumar. He added that the revenue target achieved was 60% in July and 66% in June.”

Data from the department shows that in the first 15 days of September, 40,818 vehicles were registered across Karnataka, including 30,377 two-wheelers and 5,852 cars.

The bulk of the registrations are for two-wheelers. Between April and August, a total of 3.2 lakh new vehicles were registered in the State, out of which 2.47 lakh were two-wheelers and 41,289 were cars.

Moreover, registration of new passenger transportation vehicles such as buses and taxis have remained considerably low. During this period, only 220 buses were registered. In May, not even one new bus was registered across Karnataka.

“Usually, the number of vehicle registrations increases during festival season such as Dasara and Deepavali. We are hoping that the trend continues this year too,” said a department official.

However, while revenue from registration is picking up, taxes collected from transport operators have remained low. Nataraj Sharma, general secretary of the Karnataka State Tourist Operators Association, said, “Every year, we used to pay ₹3,200 crore as tax to the exchequer. After the spread of the pandemic and non-cooperation by the State government, many operators decided to surrender the documents and not to operate the vehicles to minimise their losses.”

He estimated that more than 35,000 buses have remained off the road. “Repeated pleas to waive the tax for six months were ignored. The government is doing nothing for the revival of our business. I think they are happy with the revenue collection they are getting from the newly registered vehicles,” he added.

Recently, the State government took a decision to lower taxes applicable for contract carriage vehicles (having seating capacity of 13 to 20). The tax per seat was reduced from ₹900 to ₹700.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/be5uut/article32757272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGVEHICLES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vehicle-registrations-on-the-upswing-in-karnataka/article32756214.ece

The five Dasara elephants led by 54-year-old Abhimanyu, who will be carrying the 750 kg golden howdah for the first time this year, were accorded a traditional welcome into the Mysuru palace on Friday.

The caparisoned elephants that arrived from their respective forest camps on Thursday and stayed overnight at Aranya Bhavan majestically marched into the palace to begin their Dasara journey amidst the music of ‘Nadaswara’. Unlike the past, they were brought to the palace from Aranya Bhavan in trucks to avoid people gathering around them as a precaution owing to COVID-19.

The elephants received a rousing reception after their arrival at the Jayamarthanda gate of the palace. The Police Band accorded a guard of honour to the jumbos that marched onto the premises at 12:45 p.m. as they were showered by flowers by Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar, elected representatives and officials, setting the ball rolling the festivities. Pujas were performed to the jumbos before they entered the palace.

As a custom, the Minister handed out bouquets of fruits to key officials requesting them to successfully conduct the festivities.

The mahouts and kavadis of the elephants – Abhimanyu, Vikrama, Gopi, Cauvery and Vijaya – also received welcome kits containing daily essentials and other needs on the occasion as they will be staying in the palace premises in makeshift tents and training elephants for the Jamboo Savari.

MLAs S.A. Ramdas, G.T. Deve Gowda, L. Nagendra, Mayor Tasneem, Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri, DCF Alexander and other senior officials were present. All dignitaries underwent thermal screening at the palace before the event.

After a day’s rest on Saturday, the elephants will begin their training for the Jamboo Savari on the palace premises from Sunday. They won’t be taken out of the palace as a precaution in view of the pandemic. The training used to be done till Bannimantap all these years. Now, with the procession limited to the palace, the training will also be confined to the palace fortress.

Deputy Conservator of Forest Alexander told The Hindu that all training for elephants will be confined to the palace and the jumbo camp will have CCTV surveillance with constant monitoring of their health by the forest staff and vets and provision of a special diet.

COVID-19 test for mahouts

Mr. Alexander said the mahouts, kavadis and the supporting staff of the elephants would undergo COVID-19 tests on Saturday. All together, around 30 of them would take the test on the palace premises conducted by healthcare authorities.

87,2020/10/03,"Book release marks Gandhi, Shastri Jayantis in Gadag","The release of a book on the panchayat raj system in the country marked the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhiji and Lal Bahadur Shastri at the Karnataka State Rural Development and Panchayat Raj University in Gadag on Friday.

Former Principal Secretary of Department of Public Works J.C. Tallur released the first volume of the book Dimensions and Evolution of Panchayat Raj System in India. Earlier, the dignitaries paid floral tributes to the late leaders. Lauding the university for publishing the book, Mr. Tallur hoped that the book would pave the way for several such publications from the university.

He said that there were several books on the life and views of Gandhiji which would change one’s very nature, and he called upon teachers and students to make it a habit to read such books.

Dirctor of the Dharwad wing of Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project Prakash Bhat said that the concept of swaraj by Gandhiji would pave the way for self development of the people and their active participation in governance.

There was a need for taking up further studies on the panchayat raj system and also clear misconceptions about the system among the people, he said.

88,2020/10/03,‘Bruhat Mysuru Mahanagara Palike’ plan gets a new push,"State government should decide whether MCC should be upgraded on the basis of population or other parameters, says Minister Somashekar

The long-pending proposal to expand the jurisdiction of Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) to include several villages on the outskirts and upgrade the civic body into a ‘Bruhat Mysuru Mahanagara Palike’ or ‘Greater Mysuru’ has picked up pace once more.

Acknowledging the growing demand for upgrading MCC, Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar told reporters here on Friday that a decision in this regard will be taken after a meeting with MLAs and other elected representatives. He said villages falling under the limits of eight gram panchayats on the outskirts of Mysuru will qualify to be included in the expanded civic body. However, he said it was up to the State government to examine whether MCC should be upgraded on the basis of population or any other parameters.

Mr. Somashekar’s assertion comes close on the heels of a letter written by Mysuru MP Pratap Simha to Minister for Municipal Administration K.C. Narayan Gowda on September 1, 2020, making a case for an imperative need to upgrade MCC by referring to the growth of several villages in Mysuru taluk such as Alanahalli, Hanchya, Kadakola, Ramanahalli, Hosahundi, Devalapura, Srirampura, Jayapura, Bogadi, Hootagalli, Hinkal, Koorgalli, Ilavala, Belavatha, Siddalingapura, Udburu, Dhanagalli and Lalithadripura.

He said these villages on the outskirts of Mysuru had witnessed enough growth owing to the establishment of several residential layouts and industrial areas. This, Mr. Simha, said had led to a growth in the population of the areas as well as the revenue earned by the respective gram panchayats. The villages can be included into the MCC and the civic body can be upgraded as per the provisions of the Karnataka Municipal Administrations Act, 1964, he said. The inclusion of the villages into the jurisdiction of a Greater Mysuru was necessary to provide basic amenities in the area, he said, while asking Mr. Narayan Gowda to issue necessary directions to officials.

Presently, the jurisdiction of MCC stretches across a total of 128.4 sq km inside the Outer Ring Road. Several areas had witnessed development in the recent past fall outside the Outer Ring Road, which is not within the geographic purview of MCC.

Residents of many such areas, including layouts developed or approved by Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) have been denied of basic amenities including drinking water. The absence of a garbage collection mechanism in the areas falling outside the jurisdiction of MCC has led to indiscriminate dumping of household and other waste on vacant areas along the Outer Ring Road.

MUDA promises measures against garbage menace

The Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) will soon take steps to curb the menace arising out of indiscriminate dumping of garbage in areas outside the Mysuru City Corporation’s (MCC) jurisdiction.

Household waste is found dumped in heaps in various vacant spots along the Outer Ring Road (ORR) as the residents of several new residential layouts formed by the MUDA or approved by MUDA denied a garbage collection mechanism.

MUDA chairman H.V. Rajeev told The Hindu that MUDA was planning to take steps in this regard as residents of layouts developed or approved by MUDA pay property tax to the authority. He said the MUDA was planning to purchase a jetting machine, used for cleaning underground drainage, besides taking steps to prevent indiscriminate dumping of garbage in the areas under its jurisdiction.

MUDA will also take steps to ensure that garbage collected from MCC areas is not illegally dumped in MUDA areas instead of being taken to the designated waste management centre at J.P. Nagar on the outskirts of the city.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ribmdg/article32756157.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGMCCEXPANSION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bruhat-mysuru-mahanagara-palike-plan-gets-a-new-push/article32756158.ece

Minister for Mines and Geology and Gadag in charge, C.C. Patil on Friday visited Boodihal village in Nargund taluk, where water had entered houses after Wednesday night’s downpour.

Already a relief centre has been set up at the government school in the village and people have been requested to take shelter temporarily at the school.

Hearing the grievances of the residents of Boodihal, the Minister assured them of taking permanent measures to solve the problem of inundation during rainy days. The residents urged the Minister to build a retaining wall along the stream that passes by the village.

They also urged him to initiate works to remove silt from the stream and widen the course of the stream to avoid problems during rainy season.

They also urged the Minister to take up construction of Ashraya houses in the vacant land in the village for those who are not having shelter of their own.

Responding to residents’ plea, the Minister asked the officials to immediately take steps to pump out the water that inundated several houses and also initiate works to widen the course of the stream.

Mr. Shivakumar said they would focus on strengthening the party from the grassroot level. He said that the Congress would organise State and divisional-level programmes in the bhavan.

Laxmi Hebbalkar, MLA, urged party workers not to lose hope in the party’s strength. “We are the ideological descendants of Gandhiji. Our fight against fascist forces will continue,” she said.

Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah urged party workers and leaders to take up people’s issues and participate in pro-people movements.

He criticised the Uttar Pradesh police for booking cases against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for violating prohibitory orders.

“That is a baseless charge. Mr. Rahul Gandhi was willing to walk alone to the victim’s house. But the police did not allow him,” he said. He said the U.P. government was anti-democratic. “It is a RSS government. It has no respect for democratic ideals,” he said.

Later, Mr. Siddarmaiah told journalists that the Congress would not consider JD(S) leader H.D. Kumaraswamy’s statement about electoral alliances seriously.

“I would like to ask him who had gone to him seeking an alliance? According to me, the JD(S) is not a political party at all,” he said.

He said the party was yet to discuss the issue of choosing the party nominee for the Belagavi Lok Sabha seat. “The bypoll is yet to be declared.

92,2020/10/03,Unwritten rules can be relaxed by high command: C.T. Ravi,"He was recently appointed BJP national general secretary

Minister for Tourism C.T. Ravi has said that “one person, one post” is an “unwritten rule” in the BJP, but there have been instances of the party high command relaxing such rules.

This statement gains significance in the context of the expectation that he would quit the Ministry in the light of recently being appointed as national general secretary of the BJP.

While not directly citing Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa (77) by his name, he said, “Norms like ‘one person, one post’ or that people aged above 75 should not hold posts in the government are unwritten rules in the party. However, the party high command has relaxed these norms on some occasions.”

Mr. Ravi told presspersons in Chikkamagaluru on Friday that he would speak to party’s senior leaders in New Delhi before taking a decision on resigning as Minister. He said he was ready to resign as Minister and he would do so when the party high command instructs him.

He was, however, quick to add, “If I were asked to choose between the party position and Minister’s post, I would go with the former.”

The Minister would be participating in BJP office-bearers’ meeting scheduled for October 5 and 6 in New Delhi. “I will discuss the issue with party’s national president J.P.

93,2020/10/03,Activists suspect campaign to scuttle Bengaluru-Karwar Express train service,"Railway activists suspect a campaign to scuttle the Yeshwantpur-Karwar-Yeshwantpur Express service, which was introduced as Bengaluru-Karwar-Bengaluru Special Express from September 4, claiming poor occupancy. This is despite the fact that all special trains introduced during various unlock phases were running almost empty.

Citing reports in a section of the media that said very few people travelled to Bengaluru or Karwar in the special service, the activists said it could be a design to cancel the train that was sanctioned after much fight with the Railway Board. The Yeshwantpur-Karwar-Yeshwantpur (16595/596) train was introduced on March 7, just before the COVID-19 lockdown.

Activists Gautam Shetty, Sudarshan Puttur, and Vivek Nayak have urged South Western Railway (SWR) to conduct an enquiry into false reports being spread.

SWR’s Chief Public Relations Officer E. Vijaya said the figures being circulated on occupancy were far from actual. On an average, 100 to 250 people travelled on both directions during the period, she said quoting figures from the reservation system.

Ms. Vijaya told The Hindu that special trains were running with very poor patronage pan-India during unlock phases. “No decision can be taken on the basis of occupancy during this period,” she said.

The advance reservation for Bengaluru-Karwar-Bengaluru services, Ms. Vijaya said, were encouraging, with an average booking for 150-200 berths during weekdays and Reservation Against Cancellation (RAC) during weekends, meaning the berths were full.

The train, with seven sleeper class coaches, one each 2-tier AC and 3-Tier AC coach, two second sitting, and one luggage-cum-brake van coaches, offers 954 berths.

Train No. 06539/06540 Bengaluru–Mysuru–KSR Bengaluru Express Special (six days a week) too will be cancelled from October 7 for the same reason.

A release from SWR here said the Bengaluru-Mangaluru service would be cancelled with effect from October 7 and the Mangaluru-Bengaluru service would be cancelled with effect from October 11. A notification said the decision for temporary cancellation was being taken on the directions of the Railway Board. Expressing surprise over SWR’s decision, sources in Southern Railway that controls Mangaluru Railway region said, an average 100 passengers boarded the train from Central itself every day. The patronage has improved from 10-15 people in the beginning (September first week) to nearly one hundred these days, they said.

Consequent to cancellation of train no. 065165/16, the days of service of train no. 06517/18 Bengaluru-Mangaluru-Bengaluru Special Express (three days a week via Mysuru) will change, SWR said.

96,2020/10/03,Kottayam port starts domestic movement of cargo,"40-foot-long consignment from Gujarat brought by road from Kochi port

In a major boost to the manufacturing and trading sectors in the Central Travancore region, the Kottayam port, the first multi-modal Inland Container Depot (ICD) in the country using inland water navigation, has begun moving domestic cargo.

Marking the opening of coastal movement through the port here, a 40-foot-long container was brought in from Gujarat the other day. According to port officials, the consignment containing raw material for the natural rubber-based manufacturing units in ‘the Kottayam belt,’ was transported by road from Kochi.

Abraham Varghese, Managing Director, Kottayam port, said the port was preparing to conduct the coastal movement on a regular basis, besides the export-import operations. Till now, the clients in the region used to take delivery of their cargo directly from the Kochi port.

“This marks a shift from port-to-port service to a door-to door operation by which cargo travels from a port in Gujarat all the way to Kottayam. Besides bringing down the cost of transportation, it will also help de-congest the roads once we resume the barge operations,” he said.

Port officials claimed that considering the difference in ground rent and other costs between the ports at Kochi and Kottayam, the customer could save at least ₹3,000 per container by opting for a point-to-point service.

Meanwhile, the port officials have resumed consultations with a couple of barge operators for resuming water navigation. Upon closing a deal, the port would also require to take permission from the State government for commencing barge operations.

An application by the port authority seeking a licence to operate as a Customs Port under Section 7 of the Customs Act had been under active consideration of the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC).The licence will enable the port to switch its cargo traffic operations entirely to the inland waterways.

Launched in 2007, the ICD Kottayam currently operates as a dry port with road and rail as its two designated modes of transit.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bspipo/article32762845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/nattakom-port,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kottayam-port-starts-domestic-movement-of-cargo/article32762837.ece

Inaugurating the Hope 2030 Development Summit organised by the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Development Studies (RGIDS), Mr Chidambaram said Kerala should emulate Singapore and Europe in economic development if it wanted to sustain its social sector achievements.

Kerala’s high literacy rate, life expectancy, low informant mortality, and robust health and education sector should have propelled its growth. However, the State seemed to have fallen short of expectations.

Kerala’s growth rate was a dismal 6.3%. It was much less than the national average. The State had the potential to emerge as an economic powerhouse.

99,2020/10/03,Protest mounting over suspension of doctor,"Talks with Health Minister fail, medical faculty boycotts OP and ward duties

Protest has been mounting among the medical fraternity in the State over the suspension of a senior faculty member, who is also the COVID Nodal Officer at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Thiruvananthapuram, over the alleged negligence committed in the care of an elderly patient.

The medical faculty at the MCH had gone on a flash strike and demonstration on Friday afternoon itself, soon after the government issued the order suspending G. Aruna and two head nurses.

Talks between doctors and the Health Minister failed, following which the entire medical faculty in all government medical colleges went on strike, boycotting OP and ward duties from 8 a.m. till 10 a.m. Doctors in Thiruvananthapuram MCH are now on a 48-hour relay hunger strike, which is expected to end on Monday.

“The government has chosen to ignore the ground realities of acute human resource shortage at the MCH, which has resulted in the poor care given to the patient. Rather than resolving the situation, the government has chosen the easy way of making a scapegoat of one of our most hard working and respected senior colleague. This cannot be accepted. Unless Dr. Aruna’s suspension is withdrawn, we will stay away from all non-COVID duties from Monday,” R. Dileep, secretary, Thiruvananthapuram unit of Kerala Government Medical College Teachers Association (KGMCTA), said.

Mass resignation

Following a directive issued by the KGMCTA, COVID Nodal Officers in Thrissur, Ernakulam, Kozhikode and SAT Hospital here also submitted their resignation letters. They have asked that they be relieved from the COVID additional duty that had been thrust on them, in protest against the manner in which Dr. Aruna had been suspended, even when a detailed inquiry by the Director of Medical Education was still pending.

“The incident involving the patient was very unfortunate. Unless the government take steps to understand the administrative and systemic issues at the MCH and resolve it, more such incidents will occur. COVID nodal officers have been under tremendous stress all these months. This indifference of the government to our plight is demoralising for the medical fraternity. This is an emotional issue for us,” Dr. Dileep said.

Meanwhile the nurses’ unions are also on protest and they observed Saturday as “Black Day.’",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/protest-mounting-over-suspension-of-doctor/article32761836.ece
100,2020/10/03,"Kodiyeri, Chennithala spar over mobile phone ‘gift’","Row over participation in raffle draw at UAE consulate

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on Saturday feuded over whether it was proper to participate in a raffle organised by a foreign consulate and accept a prize.

Mr Balakrishnan said that Mr. Chennithala had admitted that he had participated in a lucky draw held at the UAE consulate here. If so, Mr. Chennithala had violated Section 38 (c) of the protocol that governs such interactions.

The rule forbids citizens from participating in lotteries and draws organised by foreign entities. The law viewed the violation of the section as an offence under the Indian Penal Code and not a legitimate diplomatic activity, Mr. Balakrishnan said.

He added that Mr. Chennithala had lost the moral right to criticise Minister for Minority Welfare and Waqaf, K. T. Jaleel, for accepting Koran and food kits as Ramzan charity from the UAE government. Dr Jaleel had conducted a genuine transaction within the bounds of the rules of official conduct.

Mr. Chennithala said he had attended the UAE national raising day function at the consulate as the chief guest last year. The organisers had welcomed him with a shawl, which he gave away immediately. He had not accepted any other gift though there was a raffle for attendees. A personal aide of his received a watch.

An officer in the protocol section had received a mobile phone. The government employee was on Mr .Balakrishnan's staff when he was Home Minister, Mr. Chennithala said.

The controversy had acquired an intensely political edge because gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh was the master of the ceremonies at the function. At the time, she was a senior consulate staff.

The 2019 function came under a severe spotlight after the builder contracted by the UAE Red Crescent to construct dwellings for the poor at Thrissur via Life Mission had ‘revealed’ in a court filing that he had bought five expensive mobile phones at the behest of Swapna.

He reportedly claimed that Swapna had said that she intended to gift the phones to dignitaries invited to the event, including Mr. Chennithala. The builder alleged that the mobile phones were a minor component of the substantial bribe he had allegedly paid Swapna and other intermediaries to bag the UAE Red Crescent construction contract.

Mr. Chennithala petitioned the police to identify the phone users. He hinted that they might include the kin of ruling front leaders.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kodiyeri-chennithala-spar-over-mobile-phone-gift/article32761686.ece
101,2020/10/03,Tribespeople begin road work through forest,"Confront forest officials as their age-long demand for access falls on deaf ears

The tribespeople living in Alli Moopan hamlet at Thekkadi in Nemmara forest division began constructing a road through the jungle, challenging the resistance posed by the Forest officials.

The tribespeople began their road work on Gandhi Jayanti day after their decades-long demand fell on deaf ears. Marooned in Parambikulam Tiger Reserve within Muthalamada village of Palakkad district, the people of Thekkadi cannot reach their panchayat or village office at Muthalamada without entering Tamil Nadu.

They are travelling nearly 60 km from Parambikulam via Tamil Nadu to reach Muthalamada for any civic-related matters. A road through the forest will reduce the current detour by 10 times. “We have been suffering for long, and demanding this road for ages. But none cared. The forest road will take us to Muthalamada in six kilometers,” said tribal youngster Muthu.

The six-kilometer stretch from Thekkady to Chemmanampathy will resolve a long-pending issue faced by the tribespeople living at Parambikulam. The COVID-19 lockdown had caused hardships to the people of Thekkady as Tamil Nadu authorities did not give permission for their travel.

“To go to our panchayat office to get a certificate or to pay the tax, we will have to get the permission of Tamil Nadu. We have no alternative now but to construct a road on our own,” said tribal leader Chandran.

He said the tribespeople were protecting the forest from encroachers. “But for us, thieves would have plundered this woods,” he said.

The protesting tribespeople said that governments that kept alternating in five years and the people’s representatives had all promised them about the road, but none did anything sincerely for them.

“We chose Gandhi Jayanti day for this noble act as Mahatma had earned India freedom. Although India got freedom 73 years ago, the people of Thekkady are still in bondage,” said Chandran.

The tribespeople carried the photos of Mahatma Gandhi while constructing the road. Although the authorities tried to dissuade the people from “illegally constructing the road”, the tribespeople did not withdraw.

102,2020/10/03,"Amid spike in cases, Kerala enforces tighter restrictions","Measures already in place are being ignored, says CM.

Tighter restrictions came into force from Saturday in the State as part of measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

District Collectors had issued prohibitory orders by invoking Section 144 of the Cr.PC banning certain activities, including gathering of more than five people in public spaces.

In 13 districts, except Kasaragod, the prohibitory orders will be in place till the midnight of October 31. In Kasaragod, it will be in place till the midnight of October 9, as per the order issued by the District Collector.

The State government had on October 1 directed the Collectors to impose the restrictions, given the alarming spike in COVID-19 cases across the State. As per the orders, a maximum of 50 persons are allowed to attend marriages and 20 persons at funerals.

Government functions and religious, political, social and cultural activities should restrict attendance to a maximum of 20 persons. Public transport, government and commercial institutions, industries, hospitals can operate by adhering to social distancing and break-the-chain protocols.

11 arrested

Eleven persons were arrested and 25 cases registered on Saturday for violation of the prohibitory orders, the police said.

Meanwhile, it appeared that the orders also gave rise to some confusion as to what is allowed and what is not. Many people took to the Facebook pages of District Collectors to air their doubts regarding a multitude of issues such as whether dining is still allowed in restaurants, whether shops are allowed to function or not, and whether cinema halls would open on October 15 as permitted by the Centre.

Quite a few people wanted to know whether gymnasiums are allowed to open when the prohibitory orders are in force. The District Collector, Malappuram, for instance, had on Friday itself specified restrictions on sports activities/facilities, including gyms and swimming pools, but many Collectors had not.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Saturday that COVID-19 prevention measures would be enforced more stringently in the State. The government decided to impose a heftier fine for failure to wear masks and close down shops that disobey norms.

In shops, especially, it was important to maintain social distancing, wear gloves and masks, and use sanitiser, the Chief Minister said.

103,2020/10/03,Growing resentment in BJP State unit,"Exclusion of senior leaders in party rejig has irked a prominent section

A section of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Kerala unit has appeared to be miffed with exclusion of senior leaders in the recent rejig of the party at the national level.

What has rattled this prominent section is not only the exclusion of these leaders but also the elevation of A.P. Abdullakutty as a national vice president. All along the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) State leadership has been rooting for former State presidents Kummanam Rajasekharan and P.K. Krishnadas to be part of the Central team.

Already some leaders have overtly and covertly raised the issue and apprised BJP all-India president J.P. Nadda of a group owing allegiance to one of factions getting prominence at the helm at the State and national levels. The ongoing rumblings had also come up for discussion at the party forum, a BJP functionary said.

Another issue is the non-inclusion of Keralite R. Balashankar, co-convener of training and publication of the party in Delhi. He was earlier the editor of RSS ideological journal Organiser for 11 years and was also head of the BJP national Intellectual Cell till 2015. He has been credited with the idea of projecting Narendra Modi as the face of the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.

RSS leaders feel that the Central leadership had systematically ignored some of the respected and popular leaders from the State. And the relegation of leaders might have a bearing on the Assembly polls next year.

All these years, the BJP Central leadership has not appointed a leader who has good relationship with the NSS, the SNDP and the Church in the State. Neither it has not been able to nurture a leader who has a core support base among the Nair or the Thiyya/Ezhava communities, the sources said.

The resentment comes when the Central leadership has started wooing leaders from other parties with the elevation of Mr. Abdullakutty at the national level. Perhaps it may want the State unit to have a multi-polar image ahead of the Assembly polls. But the national leadership has to set the State unit in order before trying to appease aspiring turncoats, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/growing-resentment-in-bjp-state-unit/article32761111.ece

105,2020/10/03,Jumbo-size worries to mark observance of ‘Gaja Dinam’,"Locldown affecting pachyderms as owners comprise their upkeep due to lack of funds

The State is set to mark ‘Gaja Dinam’ (Or Elephant Day) on Sunday in muted observance amid concerns over the well-being of captive elephants in the aftermath of the complete lockdown.

The occasion also comes calling against the backdrop of a steady fall in the State’s captive elephant population from 521 (during a census in 2018) to 484 at present. The last death was reported late Friday when 75-year-old Maniyan, one of the senior-most elephants in the State, died in a State-run facility in Konni after losing a protracted battle with difficulties arising due to constipation. Besides old age, the worrying number of deaths is largely attributed to their unscientific management.

The recent lockdown has also had a cascading effect on the pachyderms with low economic activity, partly fuelled by the COVID-19-induced curbs on festivals, taking a toll on the welfare of captive elephants. Elephant owners have claimed hardships in ensuring their maintenance under the circumstances.

Chief Wildlife Warden Surendrakumar said elephant owners cared less for the pachyderms as these animals could not earn them income during the lockdown. The scenario began to affect their health. While the Forest Department ensured elephant owners largely complied with the norms relating to elephant shelters, several issues persisted in their management, he added.

Kerala Elephant Owners Federation general secretary P. Sasikumar said that the extended lockdown, during which several festivals including the famed Thrissur Pooram were held low-key, burned a deep hole in their pockets. “While the restrictions were necessary to contain the pandemic, the situation has created immense difficulty in maintaining elephants. It costs an average of around ₹5000 a day. We hope normalcy would be restored during the next peak festival season to tide over the crisis,” he said.

P.S. Easa, former director of Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI), pointed out that the stagnant lifestyle of most captive elephants in the State under the current circumstances could lead to both physiological and mental ailments. The dwindling income was also bound to affect manpower that cared for the elephants, he said.

106,2020/10/03,Gap Road stretch widening may be delayed,"Meet convened by Collector on Friday inconclusive

The widening works of the Gap Road stretch of the Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway may be delayed as a meeting convened by District Collector H. Dinesan was inconclusive on Friday.

A series of landslips had occurred on the stretch since the road widening works began as part of the national highway in 2017. It is alleged that unscientific road works caused landslips leading to large-scale damage to road and agriculture land on the slope of the hilly stretch.

The Devikulam Subcollector had given a report that the road-widening works had been taken up without soil analysis and ecological impact assessment and large-scale blasting might have caused irreversible ecological damage.

An official, who attended the meeting, said the amount of compensation offered by the contractor to farmers who suffered losses was not acceptable to the latter.

Power Minister M.M. Mani, road contractor, NH officials, Devikulam Subcollector S. Prem Krishnan, Dean Kuriakose MP, Devikulam MLA S. Rajendran, and affected farmers attended the meeting held online.

At the meeting, the contractor offered ₹2 lakh per acre as compensation to the affected farmers. But the farmers sought ₹10 lakh per acre as compensation. The MP and the Devikulam MLA will conduct a direct meeting to decide on the compensation amount, the official said.

The District Collector will submit a report to the government on the condition of the Gap Road stretch and the damage due to the landslips. It will be based on the report submitted by the Devikulam Subcollector, sources said.

In the report of the Subcollector, it was said that the road widening work on the stretch cannot be resumed in the present condition. Mr. Dinesan said he would seek an expert opinion and submit a detailed report to the government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/y2ysjc/article32760763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201003-WA0038,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gap-road-stretch-widening-may-be-delayed/article32760748.ece
107,2020/10/03,Conditions not conducive for school reopening: CM,"90 schools transformed as centres of excellence

Schools in the State will open when the conditions are conducive, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

He was speaking after inaugurating through video conference 90 schools transformed as centres of excellence as part of the ‘Mikavinte Kendram’ project on Saturday.

The Chief Minister said the pandemic was not here to stay forever. Focus was on containing its spread. When the situation returned to normal, schools would reopen. In the meanwhile, online classes were progressing well and the loss of an academic year had been averted.

He said the aim of the Public Education Rejuvenation Mission was to transform schools into centres of excellence. This had been made possible to a large extent with concerted efforts of people’s representatives, local self-government institutions, parent-teacher associations, former students, and individuals.

However, any reluctance from any quarter to support these efforts should be set aside for public good. If this were to happen, schools would be assured of fund inflow much greater than what the government would be able to sanction. The people should also pay close attention to schools and their development.

The changes brought in as part of the mission were aimed at the future generations. There was still much to be done for improvement of the public education sector. Changes should continue in tune with changing times.

Any detractors should keep in mind that from a situation where schools were on the verge of closure five lakh new students had entered public schools in the past three years, Mr. Vijayan said.

Of the 90 school buildings inaugurated, two each were in Pathanamthitta and Kasaragod, three each in Kottayam and Ernakulam, four in Wayanad, five in Idukki, six each in Kollam and Palakkad, seven in Kozhikode, nine in Malappuram, 10 each in Thiruvananthapuram and Alappuzha, 11 in Thrissur, and 12 in Kannur, Mr. Vijayan said.

Four school buildings were built using ₹5 crore from Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB); 20 using ₹3 crore again from KIIFB; 62 buildings using Plan fund; and four using NABARD funds.

The Chief Minister also laid the foundation stone for 54 schools in 10 districts through video conference. Two of these will come up in Ernakulam, three each in Kollam, Kottayam, Palakkad and Kasaragod, four in Pathanamthitta, seven in Malappuram, nine in Kozhikode, and 17 in Wayanad. Thirty-four buildings will be built utilising ₹3 crore from KIIFB and the remaining 20 using ₹40 crore from the Plan funds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/conditions-not-conducive-for-school-reopening-cm/article32760647.ece
108,2020/10/03,CM unveils ₹200-cr. coastal protection project,"114 sea groyn fields to be set up off Alappuzha coast

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan unveiled a ₹200 crore programme to protect several segments of the Kerala coast from sea erosion.

These include a ₹184 crore project to establish 114 sea groyn fields off Alappuzha coast.

Work on the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB)-funded, Chennai IIT-designed groyn fields is scheduled to be completed by March 2022, said the Chief Minister, who announced the programme over video conferencing from Thiruvnananthapuram on Saturday.

The groyn fields are being established off the coast of the Assembly constituencies of Alappuzha, Ambalappuzha and Harippad. These structures will benefit 625 families directly and between 1,500 and 2,000 families indirectly.

The Chief Minister said that ₹2 crore each had been allotted to nine districts that faced serious sea erosion problem for taking up emergency works. In addition ₹6 lakh from non-Plan fund had been earmarked for sea protection works.

Work to protect various segments of the Chellanam coast in Eranakulam district are in progress. These include establishment of 475-metres of seawall using geo textile tubes as a temporary measure to protect the Vachakkal, Cheriyakadavu and Companippadi coastal segments at a cost of ₹69.60-lakh. The work was taken up in May-June this year.

Another work is the building of 900-metre sea wall using the same technique along the Malakhappadi, Anganawadi, Bazaar, Chalakkadvu, Reetalayam and Puthethode segments at a cost of ₹97.8 crore.

Another ₹1 crore will be spent on building a km-long geo textiles seawall. This is expected to be ready by January 2021.

These sea wall project apart, two new breakwaters are to be built off the coast of Malakhappadi at a cost of ₹4 crore. The breakwaters are designed by the Ocean Engineering division of IIT, Chennai. Another ₹6 crore will be spent on renovating three breakwaters off Kannamali and Malakhappadi coast.

Coastal protection measures are also being taken up in Neyyattikara, Valiyathura, Vettukad and Kochuthop in Thiruvananthapuram district. The works include a ₹40.60 lakh project in Neyyattinkara and a ₹4 crore project in Valiyathura. These works are expected to be completed in December this year.

Coastal protection works are also being taken up in Madayi and Mattur segments in Kannur district where ₹16 crore is being invested in these works

The Chief Minister said that protection of the 576-km coast, coastal villages, fishers and their families and property, fishing boats and gears was vital to the State as the community of fishers constituted a ‘special army’ of the State.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cm-unveils-200-cr-coastal-protection-project/article32760532.ece
109,2020/10/03,"Sloth bear wandered in, lulled by lockdown silence","Animal, first sighted in Kulthupuzha 3 months ago, captured near Varkala, released in forest

The lack of human activity during the recent lockdown could have led the sloth bear, captured near Varkala a day ago, to stray close to human habitations, according to forest officials.

The preliminary assessment came shortly after the Forest Department released the animal in the interior forests of Pulikayam in the Kanayar forest range that is part of the Achencoil forest division.

Caught in trap cage

Around three months after it was first sighted in Kulathupuzha in Kollam, the female bear, assessed to be around 8 years old, was finally captured in a trap cage after it wandered in a rubber plantation at Palavacode, near Pallickal, early Friday. The wild animal had created panic in places close to the Thiruvananthapuram-Kollam border including Chathannoor, Navaikulam, and Pallickal.

Following its capture, the animal that figures in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 was examined and steps were initiated for its release into its natural habitat.

On the reasons for the unusual occurrence, the department held the view that it could be closely linked to the near-total fall in human interference especially in the forest fringe areas of late. The lack of vehicle movement on forest roads had earlier been attributed to the sightings of an Indian civet in Kozhikode, and elephant and bison herds in Munnar.

Another in Punalur

According to Chief Wildlife Warden Surendrakumar, the presence of humans generally deters wild animals from venturing close to human habitations. In this case, the sloth bear could have strayed too far away from the forest primarily with people largely staying indoors and vehicle flow restricted during the lockdown. Another bear was recently found around 10 km away from the forest in Punalur, he said.

While dismissing claims that the animal could have wandered in search of food, the officer pointed out that the unregulated tapping of wild honey could, however, pose a problem in the future.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/595j0s/article32760408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201002-WA0022,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sloth-bear-wandered-in-lulled-by-lockdown-silence/article32760409.ece
110,2020/10/03,MCI denies nod to Idukki MCH to admit students,"Lack of infrastructure and other facilities cited

The Medical Council of India (MCI) has denied permission to the Government Medical College Hospital, Idukki, to admit students citing lack of infrastructure and other facilities as mandated by the MCI at its last hearing on September 25.

This has a far-reaching effect as the Medical Council of India has been replaced by the National Medical Commission (NMC) with new guidelines for giving permission to medical colleges.

In a letter to the medical college, R.K Vats, Secretary General, MCI, Board of Governors, says seven deficiencies have been found at the hospital, including in faculty, bed occupancy, residents, clinical lab, and radiological investigation.

It says there is no approach road to the hospital and an old district hospital building is being used for the medical college and para-clinical and clinical departments are under construction.

An official at the medical college told The Hindu that permission had been denied without considering the facilities completed there. “It is without considering the arrangements made since June and all deficiencies found in last year’s verification have been rectified.”

He said there was an approach road now and all criteria had been currently fulfilled. However, it was not considered at the last hearing. Due to COVID-19, there was no physical verification by the MCI and the medical college had lost the last chance to admit students in the current academic year.

The medical college was established in 2014 with intake of 50 students. However, the college had not admitted new batches after the first and second year MBBS students were shifted to other medical colleges after the MCI denied permission in 2017 due to ‘lack of clinical facilities’.

The medical college was started at the district hospital building near the district headquarters at Cheruthoni with minimal facilities in 2014.

The district is dependent on Kottayam Medical College Hospital and Theni Medical College Hospital in Tamil Nadu for emergency and specialised treatment.

The Chief Secretary had given an undertaking to the MCI last year that all facilities would be arranged prior to admitting students in the current academic year. Infrastructure and clinical facilities were being upgraded from June to admit students in the current academic year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/73cn2y/article32760363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201003-WA0003,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mci-denies-nod-to-idukki-mch-to-admit-students/article32760299.ece
111,2020/10/03,Multilevel parking lot set for opening in Thiruvananthapuram,"Inauguration on Monday, almost ten months after most work was completed

The city Corporation’s first multilevel parking lot located on the Corporation office premises near Palayam is set to be inaugurated on Monday, almost ten months after much of the work on the structure was completed. The hourly rates for the public to park their vehicles here are yet to be decided.

The work on yet another multilevel parking lot near the Saphalyam complex at Palayam will also be inaugurated on Monday. This project will be as part of the Corporation’s Smart City projects. Work on another parking lot is progressing at Putharikkandam while one more proposed at the Medical College junction is at its design stage.

December last

The structure of the parking lot on the Corporation office premises was completed by December last. But the work on the fire safety equipment and testing had remained pending. The technicians from the Coimbatore-based company that constructed the facility were unable to travel to the city after the COVID-19 pandemic struck, which further delayed its commissioning.

“The rates for parking have to be discussed in the finance committee after which it will be presented in the council for approval. Discussions will also have to be held with the employees’ unions to decide on whether the employees should have it free or should they pay a concession rate,” said a Corporation official.

Across seven floors, the facility can accommodate 102 cars at a time. A sensor placed at the entry point calculates the weight and dimensions of the incoming vehicle, based on which the most suitable space is allocated by the system. On swiping the card provided at the entry point, the ramp from the specific spot allocated will arrive on the ground floor. The driver can leave the vehicle and exit the ramp, after which it will move and lock into the space allocated. During exit, the location and the time taken for the car to be brought to the ground floor will be indicated on swiping the card at the out-booth.

Executed under the Central government’s Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme, the parking lot was completed at a cost of ₹5.64 crore. Out of this, 50% of the cost was borne by the city Corporation, 30% by the Central government, and 20% by the State government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/i2i0d2/article32768010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MULTI-LEVEL-PARKING1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/multilevel-parking-lot-set-for-opening/article32760228.ece
112,2020/10/03,Extinct tree found after 180 years in Kollam grove,"It was in 1835 that Madhuca diplostemon, a threatened species of the Western Ghats, was spotted

A tree species, long believed extinct, has been rediscovered after a gap of more than 180 years from a sacred grove in Kollam district.

Scientists at the Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute (JNTBGRI) at Palode here have identified the tree as Madhuca diplostemon (family Sapotaceae), a threatened species of the Western Ghats whose specimen was first collected in 1835.

Only one mature tree has been found so far, which makes this remarkable rediscovery extremely valuable from a scientific, environmental and conservation point of view. A paper on the finding authored by Shailajakumari S., Santhosh Kumar E.S., Sreekala A.K., and R. Prakashkumar of the JNTBGRI and Parthipan B. of S.T. Hindu College, Nagercoil, has been published in Rheedea, the journal of the Indian Association for Angiosperm Taxonomy.

The lone mature tree was located at the Koonayil Ayiravilli Siva Temple at Paravur, Kollam. Locally, it was erroneously believed to be the common Attilippa. Shailajakumari, one of the authors of the paper, had collected a specimen and brought it to JNTBGRI two years ago as part of her PhD dissertation. However, surveys in other sacred groves in Kollam district failed to find another tree of the species. Since the species is represented only by one specimen in a single locality, it is eligible to be categorised ‘Critically Endangered’ by the IUCN, the JNTBGRI has noted.

Madhuca diplostemon has an interesting history. In 1835, Robert Wight, a surgeon-botanist with the East India Company, had collected three specimens. In 1848, he described it as Diospyros obovata in his famous work, the Icones Plantarum Indiae Orientalis. Later C.B. Clarke corrected it as Isonanandra diplostemon and, in 1960, P. Royen described it as Madhuca diplostemon.

Interestingly, “since its original collection, specimens of Madhuca diplostemon were never collected again, neither from its locality nor elsewhere, and botanical explorations in Eastern and Western Ghats failed to locate the species,” notes the paper on the rediscovery.

The JNTBGRI is planning to undertake the ex situ conservation of this species through the institute’s species recovery programme, JNTBGRI director R. Prakashkumar, one of the authors of the paper, says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/zgyfzq/article32760334.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201002-WA0097,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/extinct-tree-found-after-180-years-in-kollam-grove/article32760018.ece
113,2020/10/03,Kerala to benefit from agriculture reform: Muralidharan,"Says Congress and CPM opposing the farm bills for political reasons.

Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan on Saturday said the agriculture market reforms laws passed by the Central government has at a stroke eliminated farmer exploitation in the country and would benefit Kerala, among other States.

Defending the Bills passed by the Parliament and signed into law by the President, Mr Muraleedharan cited the experience of mango growers in Muthalamada in Palakkad district.

“They had no easy access to the Azadpur Mandi mega bazaar in New Delhi. The notified Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) wholesale market offered the best price for mangoes in the country. Farmers in Kerala and elsewhere were constrained to ferry their produce to the bazaar over long distances to get a reasonable price for their harvest.”

“A network of agents and transporters exploited their vulnerability. Moreover, a substantial amount of the produce spoiled en route given the delay in transportation and sale. Finally, farmers received only 15 to 18% of the actual price of the crop. The rest went into the pockets of agents who operated in at least eight tiers.”

“The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and allied laws allowed farmers to sell their harvest outside the notified APMC market without paying any State taxes or fee.”

“They empowered the farmer to sell their produce to the highest bidder at any market or place of their choice. In the event the market price of the crop plummeted, the Central government would step in with a minimum support price offer for the crop to prop up farmers through the lean season.”

“Comparably, cashew farmers in Kerala often smuggled their crop to markets in Karnataka to get the best available price. They usually got charged for dodging local levies and their produce impounded by local authorities. They were also at the mercy of ruthless agents.”

“The new laws have eradicated the need for such surreptitious transactions.”

“They allowed contract farming and direct marketing. The laws have thrown opened the door for private investment in the moribund farming sector and catalysed the modernisation of food production, storage, movement and sale. The rules offered farmers a wider choice and freed them from decades of servitude and bondage.”

“The Congress and the CPM had opposed the law for political reasons. They did not even seek a vote or participate in the discussions in the Parliament. The protests against the reforms have petered out. Farmers have realised that the Opposition had misled them,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/khp2m6/article32758687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/muralee,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-to-benefit-from-agriculture-reform-muralidharan/article32758688.ece
114,2020/10/03,‘Learning should not stop at any cost’,"NeoStencil works to bridge the gap in access to education in smaller towns and rural India

If there’s anything the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us this year, it’s that education should be accessible to all. Long before a pandemic was even on the horizon, NeoStencil (founded in 2014) set out to ensure that students from all walks of life could compete with the best in the exams such as the UPSC, IES, GATE, NEET, and JEE among others.

Kush Beejal, the founder, said that his brother and he were lucky to have been able to attend top coaching institutes in different cities as students. However, they also witnessed a lack of similar opportunities for students in tier-2 and 3 cities and villages. “Many people’s aspirations die because of lack of resources,” says Kush. “This led us towards the idea of creating a platform that could be accessed by anyone, anywhere, without spending beyond his/her capabilities. The point was that learning should not stop at any cost.”

Thus NeoStencil began as a way to level the playing field for students from across the country. Kush says that, while the tools and technology such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are now key factors in online education, the content is even more important. The idea was to bring the excellence of top coaching centres and reputed teachers to the students. All that a student needs is an Internet connection and a computer or a smartphone. NeoStencil takes care of everything else — from study material to mock-exam evaluation.

“We live-stream classes to ensure the student gets a high-quality current learning experience — identical to what they would get if they went to a classroom. There are also recorded classes that they can access at any time or go back to whenever it suits them. Students do not have to compromise on their jobs, the comfort of their home, or spend large amounts to relocate to ‘coaching hubs’.” Till date, NeoStencil has helped more than 400 people achieve their UPSC dream. Like Pradeep Singh from Tewri village in Sonepat, who topped the 2019 UPSC exams.

NeoStencil also digitises material from traditional coaching institutes they have partnered with. An added benefit is that teachers can now reach out to both their regular offline students and hundreds of others online. Not only is the content available 24/7 but assignments, mock examinations and evaluations are also the same for both sets of students.

Challenges and trends

While technology is improving daily, what happens when Internet connections in more remote parts of the country are either non-existent or extremely slow? Kush says that, while an Internet connection is definitely needed, all videos are optimised for all forms of devices. To overcome issues with internet speed, buffering, data consumption and so on, they have begun to work with Edge Computing technology to help reduce buffering times and to allow users to watch high-definition videos at the same bandwidth they already have. Today, NeoStencil has about 11 lakh registered users from across the country.

During the pandemic, however, many regular institutes too began to go online. Did this pose a challenge? Kush says that NeoStencil’s advantage is that they had already established themselves and could ride out this wave. “We often get students who want to pursue multiple exams. So we are a place where students have ready access to various products. This generates a lifetime value, which will win over an online institute that caters to a single exam.” During the initial months of the lockdown, the start-up doubled its partnerships to encompass 100 institutes, as compared to the 50 it had accumulated over the past five years.

“One of the biggest trends amongst EdTech companies is trying to master blended learning,” said Kush. “While there will always be excellent online content, bringing that element of interactivity and peer-to-peer social learning to be on a par with offline learning is what companies are constantly working towards.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/education/yji3ec/article32760601.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05EPBSNEOSTENCIL2,https://www.thehindu.com/education/neostencil-works-to-bridge-the-gap-in-access-to-education-in-rural-india/article32760602.ece
115,2020/10/03,Tips to ace the fast approaching CAT exam,"With the CAT exam round the corner, here are some tips to get ready

With the pandemic wreaking havoc across the globe, it seems that Darwin’s philosophy of the survival of the fittest holds true. Those who can upgrade their knowledge and skills and explore new opportunities will keep the growth engine moving. This is the one of the reasons why many certification courses, professional degrees and skill development programmes are emerging in varied domains.

One professional degree that has not lost its sheen is the MBA programme. While the stream one is from doesn’t matter, what is required to get into a top college is to crack the three-hour computer-based CAT and perform well in the second round. The CAT is more than just an exam; it is is a test of one’s persistence, composure, decision-making abilities, temperament, knowledge and resilience.

Here are some tips for those planning to appear for CAT-20, apart from solving the previous years’ papers.

Prepare to score well

Make a timetable and stick to it: Create a schedule based on the number of hours at your disposal. Give yourself daily and weekly targets i.e. number of topics to be finished weekly and number of questions to be practised.

Don’t do selective studying: CAT is about surprises. Any module can have more weightage in the exam. So, complete all the topics thoroughly; not just conceptual knowledge, but also application.

Enrol in a test series: Appearing for mock tests is crucial, as it streamlines your preparation and familiarises you with the test environment. It will help devise strategies on maximising scores, identify weak and strong areas, understand concepts and their applications and keep the preparation grounded. One can also experiment with strategies to figure out what works best. Ideally, a candidate should take 30-40 full-length mock tests.

Analyse mock tests: A detailed analysis will help identify what went wrong and what areas need improvement. Keep track of the performance across the mock tests and also make a note of all the good questions encountered.

Fitness is important: Keep yourself physically fit and mentally active, as falling ill can derail both the preparation and the momentum built up. Make sure the preparation is consistent and that the pace can be sustained.

Flexible approach: Don’t entertain preconceived notions or have a fixed mindset. A surprise element may throw you off track. The CAT is as much a test of character as of content.

116,2020/10/03,A holistic mentorship model can benefit college students and recruiters,"Adopting a holistic mentorship model in colleges can benefit both students, as well as the companies looking to recruit them

What are educators doing to ensure that students in Indian universities are ready to excel in the world outside college? The need of the hour is not only to focus on the intelligence quotient but also on the emotional quotient.

Most students are unable to capture the different philosophies that drive expectations for academic excellence and ideal career pathways. Isn’t it the responsibility of educators to ensure that students receive the necessary resources to achieve what they are capable of?

This is where mentorship becomes important. Mentorship is an opportunity to provide a student with the necessary academic and emotional support. Most colleges don’t have a platform to provide holistic mentorship to students. What does this involve?

Content for learners

Today, the resources that are part of classroom teaching are not enough for real-world requirements. One solution is to have a platform that gives access to “quality” content by top faculty across universities. This will enable students from tier-2 and tier-3 colleges to get such content and also teach students various other skills that will also make them job ready.

Career guidance

How many actually know which career path to pursue when they enter college? Some get some guidance from family members, others find mentors in seniors and teachers, but most are clueless. Career guidance should be mandatory and personalised to each student. It should help learners decide which career paths are most aligned to their interests and guide them to achieve a defined goal. This should be continuous rather than one-stop. A student’s career goal is evolutionary and a good mentor can assist him/her with his/her professional evolution. So, chalking out an end-to-end path, developing milestones and keeping it flexible can help one land his/her dream job/university.

Psychological support

Students face many challenges including academic pressure, relationship issues, parental pressure, ragging, cyber bullying ... all of which affect their mental health. Unfortunately, most people are not willing to seek help because of the stigma attached as well as the lack of psychological support systems in schools and colleges. One way to resolve this is to have tech-enabled solutions since there will not be a need for the counsellor to be physically present and to maintain anonymity. Equally important is to conduct awareness drives to sensitise people towards mental health issues. Students need to know how important it is to seek help and not ignore their mental well being.

Skills enhancement

The current job market needs people who have good leadership skills, enhanced soft skills and are capable of innovating. Universities provide opportunities in the form of clubs, activities and managing fests but soft skills training also needs to focus on developing empathy. These skills can be mapped in the initial months of undergraduate study, and periodic checks conducted to see if it is developing as planned or if any amendments are required. This may take time and effort but will be an immense boost to the students’ performance.

Connecting recruiters and candidates

Many colleges still do not have a formal placement process. Even in on-campus recruitment, students are generally not aware about all companies. Ideally, they should be made aware of all possible options to empower them to select the firm of their choice. What is required here is recruiter and candidate mapping. Technology can help with this and make the recruitment process easier and more effective, both for companies and students.

Colleges should invest in mentoring relationships so that all students benefit from it. It is time to develop customised solutions for students that cater not just to their academic requirements but also offer career guidance, psychological and emotional support, and soft skill enhancement. A complete mentorship approach should take the students’ individual qualities and interests into account and help them grow in a holistic manner.

117,2020/10/03,Develop the spirit of entrepreneurship,"Tips to produce efficient entrepreneurs by changing the way we teach

Globally, the world of business is changing at an unprecedented pace and newcomers barely have time to adapt to a new company or a competitive environment. The challenges they face include a complex corporate world, lack of experience, and theoretical education that is out of sync with the real world.

Instead of being part of the problem, our education system can be a solution by making learning more engaging and hands-on by blending traditional business dogmas with real-world, practical experiences and challenges. There are numerous ways to improve entrepreneurship education, put degrees on the competitive map, and empower students for productive careers. Some of these are listed below:

Allow students to participate in entrepreneurship contests: There is nothing more experiential than letting students participate in contests that focus on a social cause or tech start-up ventures. For instance, a contest that pits groups against each other will encourage students to brainstorm and come up with unique and innovative ideas.

Focus on practical assessments: Case studies or practical assessments are an effective method to spur students’ curiosity and creative thinking ability. By studying corporate success stories and operational barriers, students can dig deeper into processes and strategies that lead to executive decision making.

Innovation is the key: Instead of relying on uniformity and discipline, our education system should focus on innovation, self-reliance, collaboration and innovation. We need to teach students how to apply their knowledge to do something out of the ordinary.

Incorporate technology into the curriculum: Given how technological change is disrupting all industries, educational institutions can jumpstart their students’ careers by teaching how companies are using these changes to innovate, communicate, and make money.

Promote internships: This will help students get hands-on experience in real-life situations and skills and learn from each other while solving operational challenges. To encourage entrepreneurship capabilities in students, educational institutions must focus more on practical, action driven, experiential and hands-on coursework.

When we connect education and entrepreneurship, it teaches students to use their strengths to make an impact, analyse situations, evaluate alternatives, pick a solution, and track progress over time.

118,2020/10/03,"Forming connections, forging friendships","Making friends takes time; perseverance is key

While popular students may take the camaraderie and comfort of friends for granted, not everyone is able to forge friendships in adulthood. In an article in Psychology Today, psychologist Marisa Franco confesses that she was often lonely in college. Though she went on to author a book on the psychology of friendship later, she rues that, as a college student, she had “no idea how to form connections”. In fact, the naïve belief that friendships “just happen” can curb a person’s ability to fashion meaningful ties with others.

First, know that making friends entails effort. Franco cites a study that found a correlation between loneliness and believing that forming friends happens by chance. Like all self-fulfilling prophecies, if you maintain that friendship is based on luck, then you are less likely to exert effort into cultivating relationships, thereby setting yourself up for loneliness.

Overt vs. covert

If you want to make friends, show up at group events. But, your mere presence isn’t going to guarantee making a friend. Franco discusses overt and covert avoidance, a distinction that author Ellen Hendriksen also points out. Not attending clubs or events constitutes overt avoidance. The subtler form, covert avoidance, entails not interacting with others during social events. If you are keen to make friends, then you need to take an active role and introduce yourself to others.

But what if you feel diffident? Or scared of being rebuffed? Interestingly, our “perceptions of the social environment” is linked with our own behaviour. Thus, our own actions may determine whether we feel a group of people is frosty or warm. Franco cites a study that found that those who interacted with others in a classroom found the atmosphere to be cordial. On the other hand, those who didn’t mingle felt the classroom was cold.

Franco offers a useful tip to avoid being misled by our presumptions. If you feel a group is unfriendly, ask yourself if you have tried to reach out. If your overtures are not reciprocated, then they might not be the right fit, and you can move onto befriending others. However, if you haven’t approached them, don’t wait for them to initiate contact.

Franco offers one more suggestion that can help you get through the awkward initial phase when people don’t know each other. A study found that familiarity breeds affinity, even when participants don’t interact. If you keep meeting the same people regularly, chances are that with time they will grow to like you, and vice versa. However, ensure that you aren’t emitting negative or hostile signals, either explicit or implicit. To guard against this, reframe cynical thoughts with more salubrious ones. Reassure yourself that making friends takes time. Finally, give others the benefit of the doubt, especially when you are unsure of how to read a situation.

119,2020/10/03,When a student works from home,"It is not just teaching-learning that has moved online. Internships have done so too

The COVID-19 pandemic has become the accelerator of one of the greatest workplace transformations of our times. How we learn, train ourselves, work, exercise, shop and communicate has changed dramatically.

Future talent hunt

The increasing spread of the virus has led to cancellations/delays in many exams and a shift to online learning. Even internships, which help students get practical experience and potentially land a good job after college, have now moved to the virtual world. Some organisations have chosen to honour their commitments rather than completely rescind offers, as they consider their internship programme critical to their talent pipeline.

As major companies initiated tele-work internships, smaller companies have followed suit. Most have launched platforms by which interns can interact with other employees through chatbots or video calls, work on a wide range of tasks, take psychometric tests and access e-learning resources to expand their skills. While implementing such changes quickly is not easy, it is important, as it not only benefits the students but also enhances the company’s organisational value and image.

Here to stay

Once the threat of COVID-19 abates, organisations will hire people with advanced skills, knowledge and training. Hence this is the best time to invest in internships. With online learning likely to be a part of our lives, it is highly likely that virtual internships are also here to stay. Therefore, even in a post-pandemic world, organisations will need to work towards designing talent outreach programmes and innovate ways to conduct internships.

Flexibility and comfort

With internships being an important part of a student’s entry into a real-world work environment, organisations are looking at ways to have a fulfilling and holistic experience online. As people realise that a judicious implementation of Work From Home can be both productive and ineffective, the same may be applied to internships and thereby open up the online market even more.

120,2020/10/03,The right pitch,"Both sound designing and sound engineering offer varied opportunities in creative fields

Every sound holds a meaning and adds an emotional quotient to a visual experience. It impacts us on a primitive and subconscious level. According to the well-known film editor Paul Hirsch, “Sound is the key... If the track makes sense, you can do almost anything visually.”

Over time, consumers have also understood the importance of sound. With music and audio becoming important, there is a huge demand for quality content, whether it is movies, games, songs or anything else consumed digitally. This has also led brands to focus attention on developing enhanced audio technologies.

What is sound designing?

The art of sound designing helps content creators generate an emotion, or make a presence felt, even when it is not visible on the screen. Sound designing and mixing can be used across disciplines like filmmaking, television production, theatre, live performance, video game development, sound recording and reproduction, post-production, radio and musical instrument development.

Sound designing not only involves editing and enhancing previously recorded content like dialogues or songs, but also includes the process of creating sound from a scratch. A sound designer plays a crucial role in bringing the elements together on the screen and uniting them through the art of sound.

This is different from sound engineering, which emphasises the complex systems related to recording, creating and editing sounds and also producing multi-channel sound mixes, often using special software and equipment.

A sound designer needs to develop his/her creative abilities to foresee and imagine a sound that will suit a situation and then create it through varied mixes. Therefore, a basic understanding of music and sound can be an added advantage. In case of sound engineers, a background in physics and mathematics is advisable, as they will be dealing with sound as an energy form and involved in calculating and converting sound waves into electrical energy along with various other technicalities. However, they too should have a creative mind to envision the needed sound situation.

The study of sound design opens a career in creative fields where one encapsulates the emotion, atmosphere or message within a sound piece. A sound designer offers the viewer an immersive experience and transports him/her into the story depicted.

Sound Engineering, on the other hand, opens up varied career options including studio sound engineer, audio engineer, live sound engineer, studio designer, mixing engineer, music arranger, mastering engineer, audio post-production, dialogue and music editor, location Recordist, Digital Media Entrepreneur, Sound Recordist, among many others.

In India, many diploma-level courses ranging from six months to a year are available at institutes like the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune; Satyajit Ray Film & Television Institute of India, Kolkata; Whistling Woods International, Mumbai; MIT School of Film and Television, Pune; Ramoji Academy of Film and Television, Hyderabad; SAE Technology College, which has various campuses; and Annapurna College of Film and Media, Hyderabad.

121,2020/10/03,Academic-author J Devika begins website dedicated to feminists of Kerala in the first half of the 20th century,"The pioneering website Swatantryavaadini.in has biographies, speeches, articles, short stories, essays, excerpts from their autobiographies and more

“She is headstrong, mannish and full of the perfervid spirit that espouses lost causes”

This was how ME Watts, the then Dewan of Travancore described Lakshmikutty Amma from erstwhile Travancore. It did not matter that the erudite young woman had taught at Queen Mary’s College in Chennai before she went on leave to London for higher studies in 1926, points out academic-translator-author J Devika in her note on how the feminists of Kerala in the twenties of the last century were perceived by men and many women of that age.

This is just one of the gems in her eclectic collection of writings on and of the early feminists in Kerala in her website, Swatantryavaadini. As discussions rage in contemporary Kerala on who is a feminist and what he/she espouses and her/his identity and so on, it is interesting to take a deep dive into this website to read about women of previous generations and their fight against discrimination and patriarchy.

Swatantryavaadini (free thinkers), a term coined by Devika, is a celebration, analysis, critique and collection of feminist thought, literature and feminism in Kerala, from the twenties to the fifties of the 20th century. The writing is incisive, the thought process, radical and the content, fresh and insightful.

Within 10 days in August, even as the lockdown was in effect in Kerala, Devika began the website and uploaded 120 articles. “I learnt how to go about creating a website and did the entire work myself. I myself was amazed at the plethora of content I managed to upload,” she says, speaking on telephone from her home in Thiruvananthapuram, where she is a senior faculty member at the Centre for Development Studies.

Divided into sections such as history, poetry, speeches, fiction, legislative assembly debates, biography, petitions, memoirs, autobiography, critique etc, the website has a rare collection of women-related works, almost of which have been translated by Devika. Authors and scholars like KR Meera, Manu S Pillai, Darsana S Mini, Vinil Paul and a few others have also contributed their articles to the website.

As a young research scholar, Devika recalls how difficult it was to get authentic reading material written by the early feminists in Kerala in the twenties and thirties of the previous century. “Even their works were relegated to the sidelines. In fact, a scholar told me that most of what the women had written must have been written by the menfolk in their families!”

Not deterred by that condescending attitude, Devika forged ahead to discover more of those pioneering women who had been so cavalierly dismissed to the sidelines by the chauvinistic and patronising attitude to their writing.

The website, a pioneering work, provides glimpses into the minds of those early women thinkers and activists, some of whom had to face ostracisation, character assassination and more, for their writing and refusal to stay within the confines of conservative thinking of those times.

“I prefer to use the term the Great Churning — van-kadayal in Malayalam — to represent social change during the period of the early twentieth century of Malayali society in general, and mahaaturavi — the Great Opening — instead of the term Navoddhanam — Renaissance — to characterise the great upsurge of the oppressed communities towards liberation — of the same time, treating them as analytically distinct,” she notes in the website.

“What was interesting in those days was that some of the women belonged to different political dispensations, but when it came to the interests of women, those political divides didn’t seem to matter. They put the welfare and intellectual emancipation of women above narrow political interests,” she adds.

Women legislators, film actor Thresiamma, alias Ms. Kumari, Kulakutti Maria, a Dalit woman preacher of the Prathyaksha Raksha Daiva Sabha, women labour leaders like cashew worker Gomathy, pioneers in trained nursing such as Rugmani Amma and Chandramathy, strong women in the royal households, early educationists…are just some of the women that Devika introduces to readers.

The speeches, writing and notes on the women legislators from the twenties onwards to the mid-fifties of the last century — women such as Dr Mary Poonen Lukose, Tottaikkattu Madhavi Amma, Mrs Elizabeth Kuruvilla, Mrs A Sankaran Pillai, Mrs GM D’Souza, AV Kuttimalu Amma, Anna Chandy, CC Rudrani, Meenakshi….all of them nominated to various legislative bodies, are an eye-opener to the contributions of the women. It also documents the struggle each of the women had to battle on many fronts to create the space that women enjoy today. “They were not faultless. They made mistakes. They veered off the course. But that in no way discounts the work undertaken by these women leaders,” says Devika.

Syncretic and analytical

This path-breaking work draws inspiration from letters, short stories, essays, newspaper articles, fragments of speeches, excerpts from books and some of Devika’s own writing on different topics. The approach is syncretic and analytical at the same time, providing a fascinating overview of women and their lives in Kerala. “I also paid attention to the aesthetics of the page and a number of readers remarked on that,” she adds.

Devika has also translated and included select works of the late author K Saraswathy Amma. A ragged book, its pages dog-eared and falling to pieces, introduced Devika to the polemics of Saraswathy Amma’s short stories. However, the book, unlike those of her male contemporaries, never got the attention or close studies that it should have, points out Devika.

As she fills in the blanks in the history of Kerala, Devika hopes that other women will also step in to write about those women, famous and unknown, of another generation who freed themselves from different kinds of shackles although many of them had to face backlash from the patriarchy, while many more had to step back and fall in line due to familial pressure and convention. “But it is important for us to remember those bold women, their courage of conviction and their contributions,” says Devika.

Amazon Studios has set a release date for “One Night in Miami”, which marks the directorial debut of Oscar winner Regina King.

According to Variety, the film will release in select theatres on December 25 and later launch on streamer Amazon Prime Video on January 15, 2021.

“To complete and release a film within the same year is a difficult task. We welcomed the challenge because we knew now was the time for this film to be released,” King said in a statement.

“Amazon fully supported our intention and I could not be more excited this prescient story will be seen across the globe,” she added.

The movie had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on September where it received overwhelming reviews from the critics.

It was also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival.

“One Night in Miami” is an adaptation of Kemp Powers’ 2013 stage play which finds iconic historical figures: young boxer Cassius Clay, activist Malcolm X, singer Sam Cooke and football star Jim Brown hanging out together at a Miami motel.

Powers has also written the screenplay for the film which features Kingsley Ben-Adir stars as Malcolm X, Eli Goree as Cassius Clay, Aldis Hodge as Jim Brown, and Leslie Odom Jr as Sam Cooke.

123,2020/10/03,Actor Rihanshi Gowda on her transition from television to movies,"She also plans on shifting base to Mumbai and believes in taking one step at a time

Rihanshi Gowda is in the news for her foray into the digital space with Poison Season 2 for Zee 5. The techie-turned-actor plays a nurse opposite Hindi film actor, Aftab Shivadasani in the web series directed by Vishal Pandya.

Like everyone else, the pandemic has affected Rihanshi as well. Karky, a dark thriller in which she stars opposite Roger Narayan, is one of the films stalled. “The past few months have been tough. Most of my projects have been stalled. The creative side is completely crushed.”

The young actor started a YouTube channel to keep herself occupied. “I use the platform to express myself. I started the channel 20 days ago and post whatever inspires me. The amount of time and effort that goes into creating even a one-minute video is incredible. You are doing everything — costumes, acting, shooting and finally editing!”

Rihanshi is excited about the Kannada film she is currently working on. “It is called Anger and is directed by Nataraj Rangayana. We have started shooting in Pandupura and Mysuru. A romantic/crime thriller, the film is about a man with anger issues and the lengths he will go to for love. I play his love interest — a poor girl from a village with loads of attitude,” says the actor, who made her acting début in the Kannada serial, Har Har Mahadev for Star Suvarna.

She followed this up with acting in shows such as Mahakali and Shani; and in Tamil serials such as Kaduval Murugan for Star Vijay and Vishnu Dashavatara for Zee Kannada and Tamil. She made her big screen début in the Kannada film, Kattu Kathe, directed by Praveen.

Rihanshi says she has been approached for a couple of Tamil film projects, but says she cannot reveal anything until it is finalised. The actor has plans to shift base. “Once I am done with projects here, I would like to move to Mumbai to focus on Hindi web series.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/8x565e/article32759335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AKP7791,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-rihanshi-gowda-on-her-transition-from-television-to-movies/article32759336.ece

Actor-producer Priyanka Chopra Jonas’ long-awaited book debut, “Unfinished”, will be launched on January 19, 2021, publisher Penguin Random House India announced on Friday.

The “thoughtful and revealing” memoir will take readers through Priyanka’s childhood in India, her teenage years in the US living with extended family in the Midwest, Queens, and suburban Boston, where she endured bouts of racism; to her return to India, where she unexpectedly won the national and global beauty pageants (Miss India and Miss World) that launched her acting career.

“I am a product of traditional India and its ancient wisdom, and modern India and its urban bustle. My upbringing was always an amalgamation of the two Indians, and, just as much, of East and West,” Priyanka said.

Through her memoir, readers will get a glimpse into her journey to success in the Indian film industry as well as an honest account of the challenges the actor faced while navigating her career, both in India and Hollywood.

“... And so, while you’ll definitely learn about how I became me during the ‘in between’ of what you haven’t seen, I also hope you’ll walk away with the confidence of knowing that IT’S OK to pick up, walk away, leave things #unfinished...” Priyanka tweeted.

She won the Miss World pageant in 2000 and later made her Bollywood debut with “The Hero: Love Story of a Spy“.

She followed it up with movies like “Aitraaz”, “Fashion”, “Barfi”, “Mary Kom” and “Bajirao Mastani” among others.

After spending a decade in Hindi film industry, Priyanka headed to the West with ABC series “Quantico”. She made her Hollywood feature film debut in Dwayne Johnson’s “Baywatch“.

She has also starred in movies such as “A Kid Like Jake” and “Isn’t It Romantic?”.

Priyanka will next feature opposite “Game of Thrones” actor Richard Madden in Amazon thriller series “Citadel”, to be produced by Anthony and Joe Russo.

The actor will star in “Sangeet”, an unscripted series co-produced with her husband, singer Nick Jonas.

Priyanka’s another project with Amazon is a film about Ma Anand Sheela, the assistant to guru Bhagwan Rajneesh (also known as Osho). The actor will be producing the movie which is based on Netflix docu-series “Wild Wild Country“.

Besides her association with Amazon, the actor will also be seen in two Netflix projects: superhero movie “We Can Be Heroes” and “The White Tiger”, opposite Rajkummar Rao.

The movie, which marks Craig’s fifth and final outing as the iconic British spy, was originally scheduled to bow out in April this year, but the release was pushed to November due to the coronavirus pandemic.

MGM Studios, Universal Pictures and Bond producers, Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, said the decision has been taken so that audience across the globe can enjoy watching the movie in theatres.

“We understand the delay will be disappointing to our fans but we now look forward to sharing ‘No Time To Die’ next year,” the makers said in a statement posted on the official website of the James Bond franchise.

130,2020/10/03,State Highways Department begins work on parallel road to Vellore Airport,"The road, which runs along the airport compound wall, will ensure smooth flow of traffic in the area, officials said

While the handing over Abdullapuram-Alangayam Road (SH 122) for the Vellore airport runway connectivity is expected to be done soon, the State Highways Department will soon start work on a permanent parallel road to connect the villages.

The State Highways Department has to hand over 775 meters of land on Abdullapuram-Alangayam Road to the Airports Authority of India for completion of the airstrip at the upcoming Vellore airport. To ensure smooth flow of traffic and connectivity, a parallel mud road, for close to one kilometre, is being laid. This will run along the airport compound wall and again reconnect with the SH 122.

“The process of handing over SH 122 to the airport is still in progress, and will be done soon. But we will start work on making a mud road, adjacent to the Abdullapuram-Alangayam Road, motorable by October 15. However, it will take some time to complete laying the permanent road on that stretch,” said an official.

An official from the Vellore Local Administration said that obstacles on both sides of the runway will also be removed. “Trees, electric poles and other structures with an elevation of 15 meters will be removed on both sides. We expect the airport to be commissioned by March 2021,” the official added.

After the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issues an airport licence and the Civil Aviation Ministry carries out spot inspections, the Vellore airport will provide connectivity to airports in Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad. 20-seater planes will ply between these airports.

The Vellore airport was sanctioned under the second phase of the UDAN-RCS (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik- Regional Connectivity) Scheme.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2w27ip/article32759100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03OCTTH--Airportjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/state-highways-department-begins-work-on-parallel-road-to-vellore-airport/article32759101.ece

134,2020/10/03,AIADMK questions govt. on reopening of schools,"‘Constitute a committee to monitor functioning of schools’

The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam on Friday questioned the necessity to reopen schools when COVID-19 cases were increasing.

Addressing a press conference here, AIADMK leader in the Assembly A. Anbalagan said the government would be made accountable if any student was going to get infected.

The government should have waited for some more time to reopen the schools, he said, urging the Lt. Governor to constitute a committee to monitor the functioning of schools during the pandemic. The committee should ensure that students and teachers adhered to personal distancing norms and followed other safety protocols, including wearing of masks, he said.

He also criticised the Congress government for its failure to maintain law and order.

Murder and thefts are becoming the order of the day in the Union Territory as law and order was not under the control of the government.

One of the main reasons for the breakdown in the law and order situation, was the failure of the police to conduct night rounds due to paucity in supply of diesel and petrol, Mr. Anbalagan added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8ej3nb/article32755965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THAIADMKMLAANBALAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-questions-govt-on-reopening-of-schools/article32755966.ece

The Education Department has put in place elaborate safety arrangements, revised school days and timings, ahead of resumption of academic activities in government and private schools from October 5.

Collector T. Arun and Rudra Goud, Director of School Education, said that though schools are scheduled to reopen on Monday, classes will start from October 8 only.

For the moment, the decision applies only to institutions in Puducherry and Karaikal and a decision on reopening schools in Yanam and Mahe will be taken later.

The period between October 5 to 7 will be utilised for preparatory works, such as cleaning the premises, arranging sanitisers and thermal scanners.

Classes would resume only for the students of Standards IX, X, XI and XII and a decision in respect of other classes would be taken later, Mr. Goud said.

These sessions were intended more for guidance and clarifying doubts and full-fledged classes would be resumed only after assessing the COVID-19 situation.

Whereas previously there were five working days in a week, hereafter it would be six and the schools would function only from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.

Three days a week

In a bid to maintain social distancing, students of Standards IX and XI would have classes for three days a week, and those of Standards X and XII would have classes for another three days, Mr. Goud said.

While classes would will be conducted for Standards IX and XI on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, it would be on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays for Standards X and XII, Mr. Goud said.

School bus operations would be decided later by the Collector. Students who reside far from schools could attend classes at their nearest school for guidance.

Parental consent

Attendance would not be taken and, importantly, students would have to attend the classes with the consent of their parents. A form would be given to the students for obtaining signed consent of parents, he added. In case of any COVID-19 patients in the family, such students should not attend classes and instead, immediately report to the PHC. Similarly, teachers infected by the virus will have to proceed on leave.

Wearing masks to school has been made compulsory.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam came face-to-face at the official Gandhi Jayanthi celebrations on Friday, four days after they were involved in a spar at the AIADMK executive committee meeting.

However, the two did not converse, despite standing next to each other.

The Chief Minister and his deputy were later seated on either sides of Governor Banwarilal Purohit during the event, in adherence to physical distancing norms.

Tributes paid

As per protocol, Mr. Palaniswami paid floral tributes to Mahatma Gandhi’s statue after the Governor. Mr. Panneerselvam followed suit.

Earlier, on Tuesday, Mr. Panneerselvam did not attend COVID-19 review meetings that were chaired by the Chief Minister.

Amid the strain in relationship between Mr. Panneerselvam, who is also the AIADMK coordinator, and Mr. Palaniswami, the co-coordinator, buzz was created for a few hours, after a tweet on Friday afternoon from the party’s official handle, @AIADMKOfficial, said that all ruling party MLAs had been ordered by the “party headquarters” to come to Chennai on October 6.

Creating a stir

Against the backdrop of party’s second-line leader K.P. Munusamy’s earlier announcement that the AIADMK’s Chief Ministerial candidate for 2021 Assembly elections would be announced on October 7, the tweet created a stir.

A legislator said he did not receive any communication on the issue.

However, by evening, the party’s Twitter handle deleted the tweet without any explanation.

137,2020/10/03,‘Harassment of Rahul Gandhi reflects lawlessness in U.P.’,"Narayanasamy takes part in the fast observed to condemn the U.P. government

The detention and “harassment” of former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday reflects the prevailing lawlessness in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said in Puducherry on Friday.

“Since the Yogi Adityanath government came to power in U.P. there have been several incidents of rape, especially of Dalit girls,” he said. “Public and political leaders have a right to visit the victim’s family to console them. The Congress leaders were only trying to do that. Not only they were prevented but Mr. Gandhi and party workers were manhandled. It reflects the prevailing law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh,” he told The Hindu, during the fast near Anna Statue observed to condemn the attitude of the U.P. government.

Never in the history of India a victim’s body was cremated in the wee hours after denying the family members the right to pay last respects to the girl, he said, adding such attitude reflects the mentality of those in power in the State.

He also demanded the resignation of Mr. Adityanath owning moral responsibility for the incidents.

Minister for Public Works A. Namassivayam, Social Welfare Minister M. Kandasamy, Minister for Revenue M.O.H. F. Shahjahan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Chief Minister K. Lakshminarayanan, PCC chief A. V. Subramanian and other senior leaders participated in the agitation.

141,2020/10/03,COVID-19 management: L-G holds discussion with ICMR experts,"Scientist recommends CCTV surveillance to monitor compliance with protocols

Surveillance using CCTVs with police assistance to monitor compliance with wearing masks and social distancing norms and augmenting protection mechanisms for elderly are among the key measures recommended at a meeting convened by Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi with experts from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) at the Raj Nivas on Friday.

The discussions, led by Prabhdeep Kaur, ICMR senior scientist, focused on raising protection for vulnerable sections of senior citizens with co-morbidities through ensuring linkages between field staff and high-risk groups.

The delivery of drugs at sub-centres or at home to minimise the movement of elderly persons, calendar of visits by field staff to homes of high-risk groups and early detection of hypoxia were suggested.

Besides, equipping all field staff with pulse oximeters, undertaking periodic visits to symptomatic and home-isolated patients for checking them using oximeters and strengthening non-family contact tracing were also recommended.

On the private sector engagement, it was decided to undertake fortnightly meeting with private practitioners to encourage referrals for COVID-19 testing and sharing of findings/ lessons of senior clinicians of the clinical management review teams of Jipmer and IGMCRI with Indian Medical Association and private practitioners for standardising treatment protocol.

It was also decided to categorise COVID-19 incidence zones so as to flag areas/regions with high incidence, recent increase in cases and deaths for disseminating alerts and to caution counsel. It was also proposed to identify quacks through PHC medical officers and appeals to people, and initiate immediate action.

For improving inter-departmental co-ordination, PHC medical officers will hold meetings with field workers of all departments at regular intervals and report to the COVID war room.

Training to field workers will be imparted by the ICMR central team and home isolation/quarantine protocols are to be more structured.

142,2020/10/03,Cancellation of grama sabhas undemocratic: CPI leader,"‘Protests against the new farm Acts and laws against labourers will continue’

Communist Party of India State secretary R. Mutharasan on Friday termed the abrupt cancellation of grama sabhas across the State, on Gandhi Jayanthi on Friday, as “undemocratic”, and condemned the action of the State government.

In a brief interaction with reporters here, Mr. Mutharasan said grama sabhas were part of grassroots democracy, where various resolutions would be passed to bring them to the notice of the State government. The State, all of a sudden, on Thursday night, announced the cancellation of grama sabhas, after DMK leader M.K. Stalin made an appeal to the people to pass resolutions against the Centre’s new farm Acts, at the meetings.

Protests against the new farm Acts and laws against labourers will continue till they are withdrawn. The Prime Minister is trying to belittle the protests and is blaming the Opposition, Mr. Mutharasan said.

Mr. Mutharasan also condemned the arrest of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi while they were proceeding to meet the family of the 19-year-old Dalit rape victim in Hathras. Pushing Mr. Gandhi, a national-level leader, was an uncivilised act by the police, he said, alleging that there was no protection to Dalit women under the prevailing atmosphere in the country.

Answering a query, he said the DMK had not said anything officially about its alliance partners contesting on the “rising sun symbol”, and it was just speculation in the media. The DMK-led alliance remained strong, he said.

145,2020/10/03,Job rackets on the rise: Tamil Nadu police,"‘Gangs taking advantage of pandemic to lure unemployed’

After Gandhimathi (name changed) from southern Tamil Nadu received an SMS last month offering jobs in the Airports Authority of India, she responded by calling the mobile number mentioned in the message, registered under the name of HR, Aero, in the Truecaller app.

What unfolded in the next three days exposed a gang of job racketeers who targeted gullible youth offering them ‘employment letters’ in the names of organisations like the AAI. The woman ended up paying ₹2,500 via Google Pay as application fee, and got posted as a “ground staff” at Madurai airport within two days.

She grew suspicious when the “recruiters” insisted on a payment of ₹28,000 as caution deposit for training equipment like walkie-talkie systems and uniforms. Ms. Gandhimathi realised that she had been duped after a friend informed her that job offers like those were not made without personal interviews.

The police said many unemployed youth were being cheated by job racketeers based in Tamil Nadu, other States and even abroad. Since the suspects sent mails/offer letters indistinguishable from the genuine ones, the victims made payments. Such scams were on the rise at a time when thousands of people have lost jobs due to the pandemic.

“These gangs target such gullible youth and lure them with lucrative job offers in Central government organisations,” a police officer said.

Digital footprints

“We have directed the Commissioners/Superintendents of Police to take firm action on complaints of job racketeering. It will be easy to zero-in on the suspects based on digital footprints. In some cases, the gangs operate from fake addresses using SIM cards activated with forged documents. But there is no let-up in our endeavour to track them down,” Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy said on Friday.

In Chennai, Commissioner of Police Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal said cyber crime units had been decentralised to the police station level. “In the last two months, we have recovered ₹30 lakh lost by complainants in different types of cyber frauds, including job racketeering,” he said.

A couple of days ago, Mr. Aggarwal received a complaint from Ranjith Kumar, 31, of Kaatankulathur, via video call, regarding a fake firm Sailors Maritime Academy, headed by one Mohandoss.

A special team nabbed Mohandoss, his wife Rani, and associates Karthick, Mohanraj and Parthiban, who were involved in the racket. “Investigation revealed that the accused had cheated over 100 persons of nearly ₹30 lakh. Legal action is being pursued against them,” the Commissioner said.

The AAI and many other Central government organisations have issued alerts to the public not to fall for fake job offers.

“It has come to our notice that some unscrupulous agencies/persons are fraudulently offering false employment opportunities in the Airports Authority of India by using the logo of AAI. These bogus agencies have been conducting telephonic interviews and receiving money from candidates as a caution deposit by making false promises of securing job...,” the AAI had warned even last year.

It had pointed out then that all vacancies and recruitment would be notified on its official website and also in the Employment News/Rojgar Samachar and leading Indian newspapers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/w96doh/article32755711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02OCTTHFAKE-APPOINTMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/job-rackets-on-the-rise-tamil-nadu-police/article32755712.ece

The interim analysis of the study found that patients who were under the add-on Ayurveda medication, along with the standard ICMR guideline-driven treatment, exhibited optimal modulation of interleukin 6 (IL6) in reaction to SARS-CoV-2 than those who were under the standard ICMR guideline-driven treatment alone.

IL6 is a cytokine or a category of small proteins that regulates the immune system in the body with its pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties.

Key biomarker

“The add-on Ayurveda group exhibited IL6 cytokine modulation within seven days of treatment, which is a key biomarker indicating the progress of severity. The integrative care seems to be showing comparative earlier viral clearance. The study also explored the possibility of toxicity due to drug-to-drug interaction, if any, and found that there was no liver and kidney toxicity due to the administration of add-on Ayurveda therapy along with the standard ICMR guideline-driven treatment,” said Somit Kumar, principal investigator of the study.

It was done by AVP Research Foundation, Coimbatore, and Stanley Medical College, Chennai, with funding from the Union Ministry of AYUSH and supported by the Tamil Nadu Health Department.

According to investigators, 51 COVID-19 patients with a history of diabetes completed the clinical study registered in the Clinical Trials Registry of India. While 27 patients went through the add-on Ayurveda treatment along with the ICMR-recommended treatment, 24 patients had standalone ICMR-recommended treatment.

The youngest patient was aged 34 and the oldest 75. The last patient was discharged on August 30.

Improving host response

“The focus of the add-on Ayurveda group was on improving the host response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, where the treatment would modulate the immune response to act optimal to fight the infection, while at the same time not going haywire to induce a ‘cytokine storm’, which is the major reason for death among patients,” Dr. Kumar said.

“No patient from the add-on Ayurveda group required ICU admission, when one in the standalone treatment group had to be in intensive care. Both groups did not have any casualties,” said Sujith Eranezhath, another investigator.

According to the study team, which included C. Chaitanya, S. Balagopal and Lakshmi Prabha as investigators, the protocol was based on a dozen classical Ayurveda non-patented medicines, including Indukantham kashayam, Bharangyadi kashayam, Drakshadi kashayam and Ashtanga choornam.

“The use of classical Ayurveda medicines for the study was at the insistence of P.R. Krishnakumar, managing director of AVP (Coimbatore) Ltd., who passed away last month. He wanted everyone to use these and it should not be AVP’s exclusivity,” said the investigators.

The study ideated by AVP Research Foundation, in consultation with experts, was carried out under the surveillance of the Ethics Committee of Stanley Medical College. Doctors from Stanley Medical College V. Vinodkumar and C. Sridhar, supported by dean P. Balaji, were also part of the study.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/add-on-ayurveda-drugs-help-in-optimal-immune-modulations/article32755686.ece
147,2020/10/03,"India should never become a police State, says HC","Judge holds illegal Government Orders authorising DCPs to perform role of Executive Magistrates

“India should never become a police State,” Justice P.N. Prakash of the Madras High Court has said and disagreed with powers conferred by the State government on police officers to imprison those who breach bonds executed under Section 117 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) to keep peace and maintain good behaviour.

The judge held that two Government Orders (GOs) issued in 2013 and 2014 authorising Deputy Commissioners of Police across the State to perform the functions of an Executive Magistrate under the Cr.P.C., were illegal since they were directly in violation of Section 6 of the District Police Act enacted during the colonial rule in 1859.

Pointing out that even the British Raj had made confessions made to the police as irrelevant and inadmissible, save only for proving the discovery of a fact, and that the Colonial rulers were against conferring judicial powers on the police, the judge said: “What the Raj loathed to do, the Indian State now does with the least compunction.”

Justice Prakash stated that the police could not be heard to say that it would become impossible to maintain law order in the State without it being given the power to obtain bonds of good behaviour from habitual offenders and to send them to prison in case of a breach. “Rule of law cannot be sacrificed at the altar of expediency,” he observed.

He said Tamil Nadu was by and large a peaceful State compared to others and it could be inferred from data published by National Crime Records Bureau. The reasons for it was the people of the State were inherently peaceful and law abiding and that we have an efficient police machinery which handled law and order effectively even during a pandemic.

The judge went on to state: “Public cooperation is essential for effective policing. If the police resort to sharp practices, they will get alienated from the citizens. Now, at least, the fruit vendor and street hawker and the likes of them are obliging the police by offering to stand as seizure witnesses in criminal cases.

“The police will lose them too because Section 122(1)(b) Cr.P.C. (which provides for imprisonment for breach of bond to maintain peace and good behaviour) is mostly clamped on the marginalized and not on the mainstream gang lords. Going to prison for the first time alone will be a matter of shame and thereafter, a matter of pride.

“As our society metamorphoses into a middle class one, which is inevitable, anachronistic methods will be frowned upon by the public. To quote Abraham Lincoln, you can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. There are umpteen means to maintain law and order within the framework of the law.”

The judge also suggested that the State government could follow the detailed guidelines issued by the Supreme Court in the famous Prakash Singh’s case in 2006. He impressed upon the need to repeal all the colonial police laws in vogue and replace them with new enactments aimed at making the State police force thoroughly professional and independent.

The State could appoint competent and apolitical persons as prosecutors in courts instead of doling out such assignments as political patronage. If the State was of the view that bails were being granted by the courts liberally to notorious criminals, prosecutors could be directed to file their counter in each case and take those bail orders on appeal.

“The police can also inform the victims in criminal cases about the bail application hearings so that they can intervene and articulate their sufferings better. The recent amendment to the Cr.P.C., recognises the rights of victims of a crime,” the judge added. He also referred his decision to a Division Bench for an authoritative pronouncement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/india-should-never-become-a-police-state-says-hc/article32755679.ece

149,2020/10/03,‘People’s sabha’ conducted by DMK passes resolution against farm laws,"Party will continue to fight against the three agriculture Acts, says Stalin

A “people’s sabha” organised by the DMK in Tiruvallur on Friday, in which party president M.K. Stalin took part, passed a resolution condemning the three farm Acts and demanded that they be repealed. The DMK will continue its fight against the Acts, he said.

The meeting was held despite the State government cancelling grama sabhas.

Mr. Stalin termed the meeting a “people’s sabha”, and questioned why the government had announced the cancellation of grama sabhas. “When the ruling AIADMK can hold its executive committee meeting and the Chief Minister can go on a tour across the State, should grama sabhas not be held?”

He asked whether the AIADMK wanted the DMK not to do anything. “Is that their agenda? Are they extending the lockdown to stop the DMK?”

Mr. Stalin said the Acts would impose online trade and make farmers slaves to contract farming, with no minimum support price. The prices of goods would go up, threatening the public distribution system. “We don’t know if ration shops will function,” he added.

“The grama sabha, held as a people’s sabha, passes this resolution condemning the three farm Acts. We are holding this meeting to save agriculture, which is the backbone of villages, and to ensure the welfare of agriculturalists and farmers. This meeting passes a unilateral resolution demanding that the three farm Acts be repealed,” Mr. Stalin said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/uei7jl/article32755605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3THSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/peoples-sabha-conducted-by-dmk-passes-resolution-against-farm-laws/article32755606.ece

The School Education Department has identified 52 remote hamlets in hilly areas in the State where students are not able to access online classes due to poor network connectivity, School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan said in Erode on Friday.

Addressing mediapersons, the Minister said that students in remote hamlets were unable to access the Internet and were facing difficulty in learning.

“So far, we have identified 52 locations across the State and due to COVID-19, teachers will not be able to hold classes for them directly. Hence, the Department is studying the problem and is working to resolve it,” he added.

153,2020/10/03,State’s own revenue shows positive growth,"Tamil Nadu’s fiscal deficit stood at ₹2,605.34 crore in July

Tamil Nadu’s fiscal deficit (the difference between total revenue and expenditure, excluding borrowings) stood at ₹2,605.34 crore in July. The State’s own revenue has shown a positive growth for the month.

This takes the fiscal deficit to ₹21,833.48 crore in fiscal 2020-21 (till July), according to provisional figures of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).

The State’s total receipts (including State’s own tax revenue and share of Central Taxes, among others, and excluding borrowings) grew by about 19.4% to ₹14,041.25 crore in July from ₹11,756.98 crore in the same period last year.

The State’s own tax revenue grew by about 8% to ₹8,387.23 crore in July from ₹7,765.15 crore in the same period last year.

Within the State’s own tax revenue (SOTR), State Goods and Service Tax (SGST) grew by 27% to ₹2,997.84 crore in July from ₹2,360.40 crore in July 2019.

Another SOTR component, State Excise Duties (which reflects liquor revenue), grew by about 18.5% to ₹696.57 crore in July from ₹587.65 crore in July 2019, while sales tax (which includes VAT on petrol, diesel and liquor) increased to ₹4,013.21 crore from ₹3,820.27 crore.

Registration Fees

A major component to see a decline in SOTR was stamps and registration fees, which declined by 31.8% to ₹667.04 crore in July from ₹977.53 crore in July 2019.

The State’s share of Union taxes increased by about 8.4% to ₹1,757.96 crore in July from ₹1,622.04 crore in July 2019.

One of the things that has helped the total receipts is the early release of grants-in-aid by the Central government.

The grants-in-aid jumped to ₹2,989.30 crore in July from ₹967.64 crore in July 2019.

The State’s total expenditure stood at ₹16,646.59 crore with revenue expenditure at ₹14,894.48 crore in July.

Under compilation

However, some of the components of revenue expenditure, like expenses on salaries and wages and subsidies, are still under compilation, the CAG said.

Capital expenditure, which goes into infrastructure and other developmental projects, increased by about 24.5% to ₹1,622.91 crore in July from ₹1,303.83 crore in July 2019.

One of the key challenges for States, including Tamil Nadu, has been the increasing expenditure amid the pandemic and a challenging revenue situation.

COVID-19 situation

The Legislative Assembly recently passed the first supplementary budget estimates, amounting to ₹12,845.20 crore for 2020-21, with over 70% or ₹9,027.08 crore provided for COVID-19-related expenditure.

This is in addition to the total expenditure of ₹3,00,390 crore, estimated in the budget for 2020-21.

154,2020/10/03,Supreme Court judge pays tribute to jurists,"Tamil Nadu’s contribution in the legacy of two outstanding jurists — Nani Palkhivala and C. Natarajan — is phenomenal, Justice V. Ramasubramanian of the Supreme Court has said.

Justice Ramasubramanian inaugurated the XVI Nani Palkhivala Tax Moot, organised by SASTRA Law School, and launched the C. Natarajan Chair for Legal Studies, according to a release. Recalling the contributions of Nani Palkhivala and C. Natarajan, especially in tax law, he mentioned a famous copyright infringement case before Justice A.S.P. Iyer at the Madras High Court, in which Nani Palkhivala argued as second defendant and as a witness and rose to become one of India’s outstanding jurist-statesmen. He also recalled the extraordinary contributions of the late C. Natarajan, who shaped the contours of complicated tax jurisprudence, especially when Tamil Nadu took the lead in sales tax.

Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, who was the guest of honour, appealed to the students of law and practising professionals to live law and not merely practise it.

He encouraged SASTRA to undertake meaningful work under the C. Natarajan Chair, focusing on producing quality legal professionals.

The C. Natarajan Chair for Legal Studies has been instituted by Additional Solicitor-General and senior advocate N. Venkataraman in memory of senior advocate and tax expert C. Natarajan, his professional guru.

“The Chair will endeavour to conduct periodic events on emerging contours of both general and specific law to enrich advocacy skills and professional values in SASTRA law graduates,” Vice-Chancellor S. Vaidhyasubramaniam said.

155,2020/10/03,Some courses available only in English despite PSTM Act,"The law grants preference for Tamil medium candidates for 20% of posts in govt. jobs

It was in 2010 that Tamil Nadu’s State legislature enacted a law to fill at least 20% vacancies in public employment, on a preferential basis, with those who had obtained educational qualifications through Tamil as the medium of instruction. However, even after 10 years, the provision eludes many, as not all courses are offered in the Tamil medium.

A case in point is a recent judgment passed by Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy of the Madras High Court, with respect to the recent appointment of 148 Forest Apprentices without a single Tamil-medium candidate. This was because the Bachelor’s degree in Forestry was being offered in the State only in the English medium.

Aspirants who had obtained alternative qualifications, such as a Bachelor’s degree in Botany and Chemistry, through the Tamil medium, had approached the High Court, seeking preference in accordance with provisions of the Tamil Nadu Appointment on Preferential Basis in Services under the State of Persons Studied in Tamil Medium Act (PSTM) of 2010.

However, the court turned down their plea, citing the Tamil Nadu Forest Subordinate Service Rules, which allow filling up of the post of Forest Apprentice from two different categories of candidates. The first category comprised candidates who possess a Bachelor’s degree in Forestry, and the second category had candidates with alternative qualifications. Only if the number of candidates in the first category was not enough could the posts be filled with those from the second category. As far as the present recruitment process was concerned, a sufficient number of forestry graduates had applied for the 148 vacancies, and hence, there was no question of considering those with alternative qualifications.

Further, agreeing with the State government that the 2010 Act does not provide for “reservation” of 20% vacancies in public employment, but only requires that “preference” be given to Tamil medium candidates in 20% of posts, the judges said the litigants before the court need not be given any preference since they fell under the second category of applicants.

“The preferential rule for PSTM (Persons who had studied in Tamil Medium) candidates could not be given effect to even amongst the first category candidates because unfortunately the course of Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Forestry is not taught in the Tamil Medium in any institution,” observed the first Division Bench led by the Chief Justice.

Previous order

In another judgment delivered in June, the same Division Bench had held that a person who had studied in Tamil medium up to the undergraduate level could not claim preference under the PSTM category if the requisite educational qualification for the post was a postgraduate degree or above, that was not offered in Tamil medium at any institution.

That judgment was passed while dismissing a writ appeal preferred by J. Prabhu, an aspirant for the post of Assistant Professor in Chemistry in government arts and science colleges. Though the appellant had done his schooling and undergraduate course in the Tamil medium, he had obtained his M.Phil and Ph.D qualifications through the English medium.

He had contended before the court that he could not pursue higher studies in Tamil medium because those courses were offered only in English medium.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/some-courses-available-only-in-english-despite-pstm-act/article32755398.ece
156,2020/10/03,Activists criticise VCK’s Adi Dravidar demand,"‘It is a misnomer to use this term to claim caste identity’

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) general secretary D. Ravikumar’s recent demand that 60 castes in the Scheduled Caste (except Devendrakula Vellalars and Arundhathiyars) list be brought under the ‘Adi Dravidar’ identity has run into criticism from Dalit activists and thinkers.

In a lengthy response, Punitha Pandian, editor, Dalit Murasu, said it was a ‘misnomer’ to use this term to claim caste identity.

“Though Mr. Ravikumar bluntly states that they are not claiming the sub-caste identity, by failing to include the Arundhathiyars and the Devendrakula Vellalars, they are subtly entrapping the casteless ‘Adi Dravidar’ term into representing only the Paraiyar caste, merely for the sake of politics. The names such as Pallars, Paraiyars and Arundhathiyars were imposed on us and are derogatory. It is to set aside this name calling that ‘Adi Dravidar’ was introduced, but to use it against its very purpose is ludicrous,” he said.

He said: “Just like how the word ‘Dravidar’ does not refer to a particular caste, ‘Adi Dravidar’ does not refer to a caste either. It is on this basis that the term ‘Adi Dravidars and Tribals’ encapsulates all the 76 Scheduled Castes and Tribes. It was created to give precedence to the Adi Dravidians as seniors to Dravidians. Today, there is no excuse for a few to abbreviate it as a caste for political reasons,” he said.

G. Jakkaian, founder, Adi Tamilar Katchi, which represents the interests of the Arundhathiyar community, reiterated that political mobilisation of Arundhathiyars did not seek to establish a caste-based superiority of Arundhathiyars, but for political representation and social justice.

“First of all, political mobilisation of the Devendrakula Vellalars and the Arundhathiyars should not be treated as the same thing. The Devendrakula Vellalars argue that being in the SC list is demeaning to them, while the Arundhathiyars sought representation. One is the voice of superiority and the other is a call for social justice. It is wrong to say they are the same thing,” he said.

He also warned against alienating thousands of Arundhathiyars and Pallars in northern districts of Tamil Nadu, who consider themselves ‘Adi Dravidars’. “In northern districts, the Arundhathiyars and the Pallars are counted as Adi Dravidars. There are many Pallars and Arundhathiyars in the VCK. Are they trying to say that the VCK is a party for one community alone? On the one hand, they say they are not a ‘caste party’ and they are a party for Tamils as a whole and on the other, they identify themselves as a party of ‘Adi Dravidars’. Only Mr. Thirumavalavan [VCK leader] should clarify it,” he said.

He added: “Adi Dravidar is not a caste identity. However, when it is used for political mobilisation, people know which community they are talking about,” he said.

Writer Stalin Rajangam said issues pertaining to Dalit communities shouldn’t be seen in isolation. “This issue shouldn’t be seen as something related only to these communities but should be seen in the context of how bigger parties — the AIADMK and the DMK — and their governments failed to implement the reservation policy properly,” he said.

However, he added, “[Political groups and organisations] that speak about it should first discuss and debate it [bringing 60 castes under the Adi Dravidar identity] instead of announcing it as their political objective and then expecting others to discuss their conclusion,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/activists-criticise-vcks-adi-dravidar-demand/article32755382.ece

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was said to have assured TRS MPs, MLAs and MLCs on Saturday that the State government was contemplating reduction in fee for land regularisation scheme with a view to avoid financial burden on common public.

At a meeting with some of them representing districts going to polls for Dubbak Assembly constituency, Legislative Council from graduates constituencies, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and a few other municipal corporations, Mr. Rao enquired from them public reaction to LRS. They told him that they received several representations seeking reduction in LRS fee, sources said.

They added that Mr. Rao expressed interest in a two day session of the Assembly shortly to discuss LRS and the new revenue and municipal laws.

Mr. Rao launched a tirade against the BJP, accusing the party of ditching the State. A number of leaders of BJP spoke to him seeking TRS support for farm sector Bills in Parliament but he refused.

The State government decided to oppose the Bills keeping in view the agriculture scenario in Telangana.

He expressed the hope that the TRS would win 104 of the 150 divisions in GHMC. Thereafter, all TRS leaders would have responsibility division-wise. The surveys had shown that TRS was favourite in Dubbak Assembly bypoll also.

He also announced orientation classes for first-time TRS MLAs. He addressed them specially for nearly two hours in the midst of the meeting, it was said. They were told to mould their functioning towards public.

Sources added that Mr. Rao asked the participants to rebut campaign that the unemployed, youth and graduates were not happy with the TRS.

Kothagadi Yadamma was in her 60s. On Saturday morning, she had cardiac arrest and passed away. Many in the village mourned her. Except some age-related ailments, she had no serious health problems.

But for the past 10 days or so she had no proper sleep or food. She had worried about the dismantling of the house being constructed by her children. The house was dismantled by revenue officials with police protection. Her children had spent a few lakhs of rupees on the construction.

Yadamma family had been using the land as cattle shed for the past several years and they decided to construct a house.

On September 22, revenue officials dismantled more than a dozen houses, stating that they had been constructed on government land. Though some house owners showed receipts for tax they had been paying to the local panchayat and the allotment letters issued by the authorities in the past, the revenue officials did not care for them.

“The locals are showing tax receipts for some other assets. They were given sites at one place and they occupied some other place. That is why we dismantled the houses under construction and notice were issued to some others who are staying in them,” revenue officials said.

“My grand mother was worried about the house and she cried day in and day out. We are unable to console her and in the morning she had cardiac arrest and died. Who is responsible for her death?

Most south Indians either fear or respect police officers — based on this premise four persons from Rajasthan, including a juvenile, made ₹ 4.5 lakh in about 75 days.

They targeted 350 police officers from Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and a few from Patna, Prayagraj and Himachal Pradesh and created Facebook accounts in the names of these police officers.

“The accounts are a look-alike with personal and office photos, and updated bio-data. They would send new friend requests, and start conversations asking for money. Some officers did send the money as requested, over Google pay or Phone pay numbers,” Nalgonda SP A.V. Ranganath, who was a near-victim of such transaction, said, producing the accused before media on Saturday.

On September 18, Mr. Ranganath’s friend alerted him, asking if he needed a mobile transfer of ₹ 20,000 to his wife’s number, as requested on Facebook. The number, data and the request appeared to have originated in Odisha, but was later proved false.

An investigation team that went to Rajasthan, following the cyber-trail, suspected a few persons in Kaithwara police station limits.

“Everyone was a suspect, but with the most-used SIM card in a phone, in relation with other suspicious numbers and tower locations, a few phones were narrowed down and suspects taken into custody. The breakthrough came when one of their phone galleries showed images of SP Ranganath and other police officers apart from screenshots of Facebook chats,” investigating officer S.M. Basha said.

According to Mr. Basha, the youth took to Facebook, after their earlier tricks on e-commerce portals like OLX did not fetch results and the customers had turned cautious.

“They are not victims of police abuse or do not have any such thing against the police officials. They said that they had picked up the group of police officers as there is sympathy among the public towards police because they serve people and further, the police officials also command fear, they believed that these reasons would work in their favour. And transaction amounts too were not high,” another officer A. Rajasekhar Reddy said.

Police said the members of the gang had purchased pre-activated and account-linked SIM cards, bank accounts with passbook and ATM card, from rural areas at ₹ 3000 per set. The investigation team was able to seize ₹ 1 lakh cash, 30 SIM cards, phones and laptop, and fake documents. And further information is being extracted at a forensic science laboratory.

In line with Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of “Clean, Green and Healthy India”, initiatives such as ‘Walking for Health’ and ‘Waste on Wheels’ campaigns was launched by the Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanthi here on Friday.

A dedicated walking track named Walker’s Paradise built along the newly developed Lakaram mini-tank bund was thrown open to the public on the occasion.

Transport Minister Puvvada Aajy Kumar said the mini-tank bund developed at a cost of ₹2 crore abutting the Lakaram tank with a dedicated walking track amid lush green environs will serve as an additional lung space. An open gym and other necessary facilities were created at the scenic spot to provide a perfect ambience for yoga and other physical exercises.

He called upon the members of the city’s Walkers Associations to become members of the Walker’s Paradise by paying nominal membership fee and utilise the facility. He also suggested that an advisory committee be formed to ensure cleanliness and proper maintenance of the Walker’s Paradise.

Beautification plan

A mini-tank bund is being constructed at Khanapuram cheruvu near here and similar plans are on the anvil to develop the water bodies at Dhamsalapuram and Velugumatla as part of a beautification plan, the Minister said.

Khammam Mayor G. Papalal, Collector R.V. Karnan and Khammam Municipal Commissioner Anuraag Jayanthi were present.

165,2020/10/03,Telangana CM seeks operational control of Srisailam reservoir from AP,"Telangana CM writes to Centre ahead of Apex Council meeting

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday addressed a letter to Union Water Resources Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat seeking transfer of operational control of Srisailam reservoir from Andhra Pradesh to Telangana.

The 14-page letter requested the Central government to immediately direct the Andhra Pradesh government to stop work on expansion of Pothireddypadu Head Regulator and construction of Rayalaseema lift-irrigation scheme. In order to enforce this, the operational control of Srisailam reservoir, which now rested with AP, should be handed over to Telangana immediately.

Mr. Rao wrote the letter to Mr. Shekhawat ahead of the second round of Apex Council meeting on river water disputes with Andhra Pradesh on October 6. He requested the latter to include the allocation of water issues raised by him in the letter as agenda items of the meeting to be attended virtually by both of them and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy.

The issues flagged by Mr. Rao on Krishna river included a) instances of injustice meted out to Telangana in sharing river water in the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh; b) right of Telangana to know about its share and efforts made by Telangana government in this regard; c) illegal Pothireddypadu head regulator project and its unauthorised expansion by Andhra Pradesh which will irreversibly compromise the interests and rights of Telangana; d) ineffective supervision by Krishna river management board; and e) issues related to Section 89 of AP Reorganisation Act.

On Godavari river, Mr. Rao wanted discussion on a) objections of Andhra Pradesh about ongoing projects of Telangana on the river; and b) utilisation of Godavari waters.

In point-by-point elaboration of issues that he highlighted, Mr. Rao said relief to Telangana in getting its rightful share in Krishna river had not been realised due to gross inaction on the part of Central government. The injustices meted out to Telangana in combined State were recorded by Bachawat Award itself.

Every State had a Constitutional right to get a fair and equitable allocation of river water. However, Telangana was still waiting to know its legitimate share of water even after seven years of its formation.

The Pothireddypadu head regulator expansion and the Rayalaseema lift irrigation scheme were illegal as their original project itself had no water allocation nor approval by any statutory authority since the water was meant to be sent outside Krishna basin.

Commenting on the ineffective supervision of Krishna river water management board, he said the board was a mute spectator to large-scale drawal of water from the head regulator in spite of repeated complaints by Telangana. The board shockingly instructed Telangana to stop hydel generation on left bank canal of Srisailam power house which catered to the State.

On Section 89 of State Reorganisation Act, he said its provisions mandated Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal - II to make project wise specific allocation and determine an operational protocol for release of water in the event of deficit flows. However, the terms of reference of the tribunal did not permit inter-se reallocation of water to Telangana and AP.

Referring to Godavari river, Mr. Rao said the objections of AP on seven projects taken up by Telangana on the river could not be called new. The objections were a complete farce as the projects were contemplated, designed and grounded in the combined State.

Mr. Rao asserted that Telangana will use 1,950 tmc ft water in the river as against the present allocation of 967.15 tmc ft since the region was allocated 65.13 % water in the river in the combined State.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-cm-seeks-operational-control-of-srisailam-reservoir-from-ap/article32755370.ece

South Kashmir’s Pulwama district has witnessed a jump from 2% prevalence of the COVID-19-generated antibodies among the location population to 27.3% in just two months, indicating the trend of “fast-growing prevalence” in the Valley.

According to the latest survey of the premier Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), 413 blood samples were collected in 10 different clusters of Pulwama.

“Of the 413, 113 reported to be positive for IgG antibodies against SARS CoV-2 [COVID-19] infection, which makes it to 27.3% prevalence, with Sona Samilo village cluster showing highest 52.5% positive prevalence,” the survey suggested.

The first round of the ICMR’s national sero-survey in Pulwama district carried out between May-June showed only 2% prevalence.

“From just 2% to over 27% in two months means the disease has been spreading considerably. We are expecting a similar pattern in other districts too,” Dr. Salim Khan, nodal officer for COVID-19 and Head of the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine (SPM), Government Medical College, Srinagar, said.

Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarian from Gujarat Devji Fatepara on Saturday was sentenced to two years in jail and fined ₹2.97 crore in a cheque bounce case.

Fatepara had issued a cheque of ₹1,48,50,000 to one Prabhatsinh Thakor as a part of a land deal. However, the cheque was dishonoured on the ground of lack of sufficient balance in his account.

Principal Senior Civil Judge D.S. Thakur at Kalol in Gandhinagar district also ordered that the former Surendranagar MP would have to undergo an additional jail term of three months if he failed to pay ₹2.97 crore as penalty plus the principal amount and interest thereof to complainant Prabhatsinh Thakor.

Mr. Thakor approached the court after Fatepar’s cheque of ₹1,48,50,000 bounced and the latter failed to reply to a notice sent through his lawyer.

As per the details, Fatepara had written the cheque to return money he had taken from Mr. Thakor in connection with a 2018 land deal that failed to materialise. Subsequently, he also refused to return the money, prompting the complainant to approach the court and file the case against him.

Mr. Fatepara was the Lok Sabha member representing Surendranagar constituency from 2014 to 2019. He was denied a ticket by the ruling party in 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

171,2020/10/03,"Post COVID-19, hospitality industry trying to catch hold of its feet in Himachal Pradesh’s Kasauli","The hospitality sector in Himachal Pradesh is hoping for a revival after months of crippling lockdown due to the pandemic.

It’s half past noon on October 2, and a family of four has just walked into a cafe on Mall Road in the heart of tiny hill town of Kasauli.

Navneet Sahu, who runs the little eatery, is elated to see customers beginning to trickle back, even as he is concerned that his joy would be short-lived and limited to the ‘extended weekend’ that has brought a sizeable rush of tourists to the hill town, known as the Queen of the Hills.

“Tourists have started to visit after travel restrictions were eased recently by the government. But it’s nothing compared to the numbers before the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Since March end, the business has come to a standstill. A long weekend starting with Gandhi Jayanti holiday this week is a good sign as tourists have started to visit,” said Mr. Sahu, who is busy preparing the food order for his customers, alongwith one helper.

“At this time of the day, on weekends especially, my cafe use to be full to capacity, but today most of the tables are lying vacant. Only a few people are stepping in to eat. Many are bringing packed food given fears over the coronavirus,” added Mr. Sahu.

The hospitality industry in Himachal Pradesh has been severely affected due to the pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions. The State government allowed unrestricted entry into the State from mid-September, which has come as a big relief for the hard-hit tourism sector.

The hoteliers, however, assert that in the immediate future they are focusing on merely breaking even. Other sections of the industry, including taxi drivers, tourist guides, dhabas and small restaurants are pinning their hopes on a revival of the hotels.

“It will take sometime to get things back to normal. So far there have only been ‘walk-in’ tourists. The ‘royal’ client is not coming right now. At this time of the year we usually had good number of tourists from West Bengal during the Dushera-Durga Puja holidays. But this year, there have been no advance bookings, which shows people are not keen to travel,” said U. Sharma of Ros Common, a Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation hotel.

“On weekends though people from neighbouring Punjab and Haryana have started coming to the hill stations. We are hopeful that business will increase but so far, it’s only marginal even though we are offering upto 40% discounts,” he added.

Sharing his concerns, Deepak Sharma, who runs a dhaba on the Kasauli-Dharmpur road, said the though the weekend business had resumed, the overall sales were well below the pre-COVID period.

Lack of workers has also impacted the industry, with many having returned to their homes during the extended lockdown.

“Even though people have started visiting, we are not in position to cater to them. Earlier I had around dozen staffers working here. But now we are just four people, including myself. We don’t have money to pay salaries.. there has been no work since months now,” he said.

No takers for taxis

Ranjeet Bhagana, who runs a taxi in Kasauli town worried over the uncertain tourism business, which he depends on for a livelihood.

“I purchased a new car in February this year on loan. But there has been no work for months now. Tourists have started coming to the town but most of them are on their own vehicles. Hardly anyone one is hiring taxis. Unless the tourist buses start again I don’t think I’ll get any work. I am paying ₹10,500 every month towards the loan — I am borrowing money from my father, who is a retired government employee. When I started to run my taxi, I use to earn ₹1,000-1,200 every day. But now there are no takers for taxi services,” says an anxious Mr Bhagana said.

“The government should waive permit and token taxes at least so that there’s some relief for people who are into the taxi business,” said Kuldeep Kumar, another taxi operator, who has been hit hard.

According to government data, as on December 31, 2019, the State had 3,679 registered hotels with a bed capacity of about 1,03,053. In addition, there are about 2,189 home stay units having about 12,181 beds. In 2019, 1.72 crore tourists visited the State including 1.68 crore domestic visitors and 3.83 lakh foreigners.

Vice-president of the Kasauli Hotels and Resident Welfare Association Rocky Chimni said the State government had allowed hotels to open without any restrictions from mid-September, and since then most of the hotels have reopened in the town and surrounding area.

“Tourists have started visiting over weekends and weekdays as well and more are coming from Delhi and Punjab. The corporate business has taken a hit as conferences etc., are not taking place. We are hoping that we will be close to break-even point as the number of tourists increase. In comparison to last year in the same period the hotels in Kasauli are having 40% less occupancy,” he said.

President of the Shimla Hotel and Restaurant Association Sanjay Sood said the State government has not come to the aid of the industry.

“Garbage bills, water, electricity bills are coming even when units have been shut. Even though State borders have been open there are very few tourists apart from the weekends. The industry is trying to survive without much help from the government. Most of the units are not running on full staff strength as there’s little business,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w9npa2/article32761642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kasauli-Mall-Road1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/post-covid-19-hospitality-industry-trying-to-catch-hold-of-its-feet-in-himachal-pradeshs-kasauli/article32761643.ece

Jharkhand’s minority welfare minister Haji Hussain Ansari died on Saturday at a hospital in Ranchi, official sources said.

He was 73.

Ansari, a senior JMM leader, was admitted to the Medanta hospital around two weeks back after being diagnosed with COVID-19.

A spokesperson of the Medanta Hospital said that Ansari tested negative for COVID-19 on Friday, which meant that he had recovered.

“Therefore, he did not die of COVID-19. He died this evening due to a cardiac arrest,” the spokesperson said.

Ansari’s family said that he recently underwent heart surgery.

Health Minister Banna Gupta also said that Ansari’s death did not happen due to COVID-19.

Chief Minister Hemant Soren said that he played a leading role in the movement for Jharkhand.

“He was a mass leader with a simple sense and conviction. May God gives peace to the soul of Haji saheb and gives the family the strength to endure the hour of sorrow,” he tweeted in Hindi.

Union Minister Arjun Munda has condoled the demise of Ansari and said that he was of a very simple nature.

Former Chief Minister Raghuvar Das also expressed deep condolences over Ansari’s death and prayed for the peace of his soul.

175,2020/10/03,"Centre conspired to defame Maharashtra in Sushant case, alleges Congress","Congress on Saturday accused the Centre of conspiring to defame the state in Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case and demanded formation of an SIT to nab the conspirators.

The BJP, however, denied the allegation and said it wanted justice for Rajput.

Congress made the allegations after the AIIMS’ medical board ruled out murder in Rajput’s death, terming it “a case of hanging and death by suicide“.

In its conclusive medico-legal opinion to the CBI, the six-member team of forensic doctors has dismissed the claims of “poisoning and strangling” made in the case.

State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant alleged, “The official confirmation by the AIIMS panel proves that the investigation by Mumbai Police was genuine and honest. It is also clear that it was a conspiracy of the Modi government with the help of their fake media allies to defame Maharashtra.”

“We demand the Maharashtra government to form an SIT to nab the conspirators and their mastermind and to find the originators of social media racket by the BJP IT team. We want appropriate action to be taken against these fake channels to save our democracy,” he said.

When contacted, BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye rubbished Sawant’s allegations.

“Our objective is to ensure justice for Sushant Singh Rajput. What is the hurry in drawing conclusions? Let the detailed report come,” he said.

Rajput was found hanging in his Bandra apartment on June 14.

The Mumbai Police had earlier registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) and launched an investigation.

However, the CBI took over the probe into the high- profile case in August following the Supreme Court’s nod.

Earlier this week, the central probe agency had said that it has not reached any conclusion in Rajput’s death case and that all aspects were under investigation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gydqy1/article32759770.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SACHINSAWANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/centre-conspired-to-defame-maharashtra-in-sushant-case-alleges-congress/article32759771.ece

The ruling BJP in Uttar Pradesh, under fire on the Hathras issue, on Saturday turned combative against the Opposition criticism over the incident. Two Ministers hit back at the Opposition parties on the issue.

“The Opposition doesn’t want the truth to be revealed. They don’t care about the honour of the Dalit daughter. They want to instigate caste riot in the region”, Minister Ramapati Shastri, himself a Dalit, told the media.

Mr. Shastri, who holds the Social Welfare, Scheduled Castes and Tribal Welfare portfolios, accused the Opposition of behaving “irresponsibly” in the Hathras gang rape case of a Dalit girl.

Another Cabinet Minister, Siddharth Nath Singh, accused the Congress of running a conspiracy over the issue. “They want to do politics over Dalits and the body [of the girl]. This is a total conspiracy”, he told an agency.

Mr. Singh accused Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra of indulging in “tourism” by going to Hathras and playing the Dalit card for votes.

178,2020/10/03,Assam Gurkhas seek gazette notification for safeguards,"This follows their exclusion from constitutional, legislative and administrative rights in report on Clause 6 of 1985 Assam Accord

The Gurkha community in Assam has sought gazette notification on the issue of including it for constitutional safeguards according to Clause 6 of the 1985 Assam Accord.

Clause 6 of the Accord that ended the anti-foreigners Assam Agitation from 1979-1985 envisages constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards for protecting, preserving and promoting the culture, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.

A 14-member panel headed by retired judge Biplab Kumar Sharma had defined “Assamese people” as those who have been citizens of India residing in the territory of Assam on or before January 1, 1951.

“The Clause 6 committee report did not mention anything about the constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards of local Gorkhas who fought for Assam against the Burmese invaders in 1826 resulting in the Treaty of Yandaboo,” said the Bharatiya Gorkha Yuva Parisangh (BGYP) in a statement.

The Gurkhas were permanently settled in the scheduled areas in the last part of the 18th century as grazers and cultivators and were accordingly given permits. They were declared as protected class by the British in the tribal belts and blocks according to the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation Act, 1886, the organisation said.

A delegation of the Bharatiya Gorkha Parisangh, the parent body of the BGYP, a few days ago met State Finance and Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who agreed that the Gurkhas in Assam are “one of the ancient communities”. He said the government would treat them “on a par with other indigenous communities and protect their constitutional rights while implementing Clause 6”.

BGYP president Nanda Kirati Dewan welcomed Mr. Sarma’s statement and requested the government to issue a gazette notification for the including the community within the ambit of Clause 6.

“The gazette notification is a request on behalf of 25 lakh Gurkhas in Assam, who were given a commitment before the 2016 Assembly elections,” Mr. Dewan said.

Panel formation

In January 2019, the Ministry of Home Affairs formed the Clause 6 panel headed by retired bureaucrat M.P. Bezbaruah but six of the nine members named quit. The panel was reconstituted almost six months later, on July 16.

On February 25, the committee submitted the report to Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal for handing it over to Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

But some members of the committee on August 11 made their “confidential” report public because of the government’s “disinterest” in processing their recommendations.

Among the suggestions made by the panel were sealing of the India-Bangladesh border, reservation of 80-100% of the seats in Parliament from Assam for the Assamese people and the creation of an Upper House in the Assembly.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-gurkhas-seek-gazette-notification-for-safeguards/article32758700.ece

An official on Saturday rejected allegations that the administration in Hathras had confiscated the phones of the rape victim’s kin and blockaded their movement in the village.

The official also said that since the Special Investigation Team formed for the case had completed its probe, restrictions imposed on movement of media towards the residence of the victim’s kin were now lifted.

Joint Magistrate Hathras Prem Prakash Meena said reports alleging that the administration was not allowing the family members to move around freely and had confiscated their phones were “absolutely absurd and baseless.”

“At no point, phones or anything had been confiscated nor have they been held captive. They are absolutely free to move in and out of the village,” Mr. Meena told a television channel.

Mr. Meena said limitations had been put on everybody, including the media, for two days to ensure the SIT probe was not hampered or unduly influenced.

The family of the Hathras victim on Friday alleged that the district administration was intimidating them and not letting them leave their area in the village or talk to the media.

“Police have blockaded us from all sides, roofs, lanes and in the village. They are not letting us out,” the victim’s brother had told reporters. The boy was able to speak to the media after sneaking past the police cordon and taking a route through the fields, he said.

The boy also said that the administration had snatched the mobile phones of all the family members and that they were unable to contact anyone.

A Division Bench of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court has directed the Jammu and Kashmir administration to regulate extraction of minor minerals from water bodies and set up an expert committee to assess any environmental degradation.

“The Chief Secretary of the Union Territory shall appoint a committee of experts on the lines of directions given by the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal Bar Association to assess the components and scales of compensation and recommend measures of reparation for acts and omissions, which have resulted in environmental degradation,” the Bench comprising Chief Justice Gita Mittal and judge Sanjay Dhar observed.

The court also directed immediate steps “to appoint professional and qualified persons or agencies for technically and scientifically evaluating and fixing the reserved prices of minerals in Jammu and Kashmir.”

“The recommendations of the experts so appointed be implemented in public interest,” the judges held.

Auction notices

The Bench was hearing a plea that expressed concerns on auction notices “being issued without a study of the environmental impact.”

“We find that it is without conducting any study on the possible environmental impact on in the riverbeds and elsewhere the auction notices have been issued. We are of the considered view that when we are faced with a situation where extraction of alluvial material within or near a riverbed has an impact on the river’s physical habitat characteristics, like river stability, flood risk, environmental degradation, loss of habitat, decline in biodiversity,” the petition reads.

The plea argued that it is not an answer to say that the extraction is in blocks of less than five hectares and separated by 1 km. “Their collective impact may be significant, hence the necessity of a proper environmental assessment plan,” it added.

It pointed out that the States and Union Territories should see that the mining of minor minerals is permitted only under a strict regulatory regime and is carried out only under an approved framework of a mining plan, which should provide for reclamation as well as rehabilitation of people in the mined areas.

“Sand mining may have an adverse effect on biodiversity as loss of habitat caused by it will affect various species, flora and fauna and it may also destabilise the soil structure of river banks and often leaves isolated islands,” the petition added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/regulate-extraction-of-minerals-from-water-bodies-high-court-tells-jk/article32755747.ece

As much as 16.6% rice stocks meant for the public distribution system across Madhya Pradesh have been found to be beyond the prevention of food adulteration (PFA) standards or unfit for human consumption, during an inspection.

Of the 2.747 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) inspected across 52 districts, 1.806 LMT had been found to be issuable, while 0.494 LMT has been found to be replaceable by millers, Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited Managing Director Abhijeet Agrawal told The Hindu. Further, 0.457 LMT has been found to be beyond the PFA limit.

“We are issuing notices to more than 15 officials. Since there are quite many people responsible, we can’t remove everyone. So we will initiate departmental inquiry against them,” Mr. Agrawal added.

Meanwhile, 18% of the stocks inspected were replaceable, and would be returned to millers. The Department of Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection has given millers three weeks to supply issuable stocks.

When asked about action taken against millers responsible, Mr. Agrawal said first the stocks needed to be replaced. “We still have around 7 LMT of paddy, which is to be milled,” he explained.

The State-wide inspection was undertaken following inspection by the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution in Mandla and Balaghat districts which found all samples to be unfit for human consumption, and instead suitable for livestock, cattle and poultry. The Centre had directed the State government to withhold stocks across districts until recategorisation after inspection.

Revamp of policy

Earlier, the State government said it planned to revamp its milling policy in view of the inspection’s findings with greater emphasis on quality control and a graded approach to incentives and mobile phone-based solutions. It said a separate quality control cadre was essential.

A day after Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s tractor rally won’t be allowed to enter the State, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday hit back, asking if a “jungle raj” is prevailing there.

Reacting sharply to the Mr. Vij’s remarks, Captain Amarinder said it is a futile move to stifle the voice of an angry nation.

He warned that such dictatorial steps would only strengthen the resolve of the Congress to fight for the rights of farmers.

“Is there a jungle raj in Haryana that you can stop anyone, least of all a duly elected leader of a national political party, from entering the State or from raising his voice against the injustice being meted out to farmers,” the Chief Minister asked the Haryana government in a statement.

Coming on the heels of the assault and cases registered by the UP Police against Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and seen in the context of the earlier lathicharge by the Haryana Police against agitating farmers, it is clear that BJP governments were bent on suppressing the voice of the Opposition in total violation of the democratic rights enshrined in the Constitution, he said.

Capt. Amarinder said the Congress will not be cowed down by such autocratic and undemocratic actions of the BJP-led governments, either at the Centre or in the States .

“If they think they can break the will of the Congress leadership or quell all opposition with such high-handedness, they are living in a fool’s paradise,” he said.

“History stands testimony to the fact that the voice of the people only gets stronger if it is sought to be crushed by force,” Capt. Amarinder warned.

Mr. Vij had on Thursday had said Rahul Gandhi’s proposed tractor rally won’t be allowed to enter Haryana.

“They will not be allowed to disturb Haryana’s atmosphere. Earlier, two Congress-sponsored rallies were stopped from entering the State. Likewise, we will stop his rally and won’t allow him enter Haryana,” he had told reporters.

Tractor rallies

Rahul Gandhi will hold tractor rallies in Punjab and Haryana from October 4-6 to protest against the contentious farm laws.

Anuj Kumar reports on a horrific case that flags the prevalence of caste-based discrimination that often leads to violence

With sadness in his voice, the uncle of the 19-year-old woman who was assaulted and allegedly gang-raped in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, speaks fondly of the family’s pride. He talks of how the young woman was “traditional”. Though she had little formal education, she would give sane advice on family issues. Her mother says she was good with household chores. The uncle sums her up in one sentence: “She was a superstar.”

Following her brutal assault on September 14, the young woman fought for her life at Aligarh’s J.N. Medical College and Hospital and later passed away in New Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on September 29. Her death and hurried cremation in the early hours of September 30 by the district administration has sparked an outcry across India and protests in some pockets. The family says the authorities did not seek their permission before cremating their daughter, a claim that the district administration refutes. The ghastly incident, which has led to a political slugfest, highlights the plight of women in the State and the country, continuing caste-based discrimination, and lapses in administration.

Hathras gang rape | Hundreds join protest at Jantar Mantar

A story of discrimination

The beginning of this grisly story of alleged rape and murder is not in the undulating millet fields of Boolagarhi village of Hathras, situated 200 km from New Delhi; it begins in discrimination, according to various accounts of the family. Like most girls from the Dalit Valmiki caste, the young woman could not study beyond primary school, says her father Ram Lal. “We always lived in fear of our girls getting dragged into the millet fields,” he says. The millet fields are barely a kilometre away from where the family lives. The tall crops that gently sway in the breeze now look menacing to the family, serving as a terrible reminder of what their child went through.

The woman’s uncle, too, says she always preferred to stay at home. In her dying declaration, the woman had said that two of the accused men, Sandeep and Ravi, both belonging to the dominant Thakur community, had tried to assault her earlier. But she had kept quiet as she feared for the life of her father and brother.

“We have been punished twice,” says the victim’s younger brother Rakesh who works as a lab attendant in Noida. “Once when my sister was killed by the Thakur boys and the second time when the administration burnt her body in the dead of the night. All I wanted was to wait till dawn and dress up my sister in new clothes for her last journey.” Despite the family pleading to be allowed to see the victim’s face one last time, they were not allowed, they say. The village was turned into a police fortress and the police manhandled anyone who tried to come out of their house that night, they allege. They say they don’t even know what material was used for her funeral.

Ram Lal has an LPG cylinder, two buffaloes, and two bighas of allotted land, which is more than what many others in the village have. He works part time as a sanitary worker in a neighbouring school. While Rakesh is in Noida, Ram Lal’s older son Rajesh stays in the village. A steady income ensured that the family did not slide into poverty.

Ram Lal’s house is one of the four Valmiki houses in a village dominated by Thakurs and Brahmins. “Yeh ghar thoda achhcha hai unse (this house is slightly better than theirs),” says Khema Singh Chauhan explaining the alleged animosity between the families of the victim and the accused. In 2001, Sandeep’s father spent time in judicial custody for assaulting the young woman’s grandfather with a sickle. Chauhan is a sanitary worker in Delhi and is married into the family. “When my baraat came to this village in the late ’90s, I found the shopkeepers here sprinkling water on our money before accepting it. Not much has changed since then. They still consider us animals,” he says.

Assaulted in the fields

The victim’s mother, Gayatri, is inconsolable but doesn’t tire of talking to the media. In her retelling of the incident, the horrors of that morning emerge. On September 14, at around 9 a.m., she went to cut grass with her daughter and her elder son Rajesh. A little later, Rajesh returned home to tend to the cattle and stack up some of the collected grass. The mother and daughter stayed in the field.

After some time, Gayatri could not see her daughter, who was working further away in the fields. She called out her name several times. When she didn’t hear an answer, she assumed that her daughter had gone home to drink water as it was an exceptionally hot and humid day. But when she was returning home, she saw one slipper belonging to her daughter lying upside down at the edge of the millet field. “She would have cried for help but I am hard of hearing,” she says. A little ahead, she found another slipper and tell-tale marks of a person being dragged into the millet fields that are thick enough and sometimes tall enough to hide an elephant. Overcome by sudden fear, she ran ahead only to find her daughter lying unconscious and naked, her tongue protruding out. Gayatri quickly covered her daughter’s body with her sari and screamed for help. Gayatri says she didn’t mention anything about sexual assault to anyone as she wanted to save her daughter’s dignity. “I sprinkled water on her face. Soon Rajesh came and we took her to Chandpa police station on a motorcycle,” she recalls.

At first, the officials thought nothing of the victim’s complaint that she was struggling to articulate. When Gayatri intervened to say that Sandeep had tried to strangulate her daughter, the station in-charge took down the complaint and asked Rajesh to rush his sister to the hospital. “He sent two constables with us in the auto. At Hathras, they said they didn’t have the facility to treat her and referred her to the Jawaharal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Aligarh,” says Rajesh.

The two constables had orders to accompany the family only till Hathras and refused to proceed further. Rajesh dialled 108 for an ambulance. It took the family two hours to reach Aligarh.

Hathras gang rape | In video, victim says she was raped

One incident, different versions

The district administration and the family have presented two different versions of the incident through videos. Some of these videos were ostensibly recorded when the young woman was taken to the Chandpa police station and made to lie on a stone slab. While Gayatri insists that her daughter was gang-raped, the district administration has tried to discredit her version by circulating a video where the young woman is heard saying Sandeep tried to strangulate her because she resisted his attempt to molest her.

The administration has also shared a video where the young woman’s mother can be heard saying that only Sandeep was involved in the crime. However, in a video released by the family, the young woman is heard saying she was raped by at least two men while the other two ran away on seeing her mother. A relative of the woman recorded this video when she was in the Aligarh hospital.

A source in the hospital says the woman noted down four names in her dying declaration and attributed the crime to enmity between the families. Brahm Singh, Circle Officer, Sadabad, who recorded the statement on September 22, says she mentioned the names of Ravi, Ram Singh, and Luv Kush, and so their names were added to the FIR under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The family alleges the police are trying to drop the gang-rape charges so that the accused will not be sent to the gallows. An uncle of the young woman who works in Aligarh Muslim University says, “My niece had told her mother about the sexual assault when she regained consciousness. She had kept silent earlier because of social pressures. But when she told the investigating officer about the gang rape, we accepted it as her decision.”

Hathras gang rape | Plea in Supreme Court for CBI or SIT probe

A lack of trust

Vikrant Vir, Superintendent of Police (SP), Hathras, refutes the claim that an attempt is being made to save the accused. “Had that been the case, why would we [the Station House Officer] lodge an FIR under attempt to murder and atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes within an hour of the incident,” he asks. Why was the SHO shifted out of his post a few days after filing the FIR, then? “I shifted him to police lines because I felt he could not win the trust of the people he is meant to serve,” he says. Vir himself was suspended on October 2.

Vir, who is from Bihar, adds that Sandeep was arrested on September 19, a few days after the incident. And when the girl named the other three men, the police nabbed them quickly and added the section of the IPC pertaining to gang rape to the FIR, he says.

Vir also insists that the timing of the cremation was not odd. “I have been told it is not unusual to conduct last rites during the night in this belt. Another official said if you delay the cremation, the soul wanders... The point is, there is no one Hindu way. Anyone can be wiser in hindsight. Anyway, a three-member SIT has come to guide us.”

Both Vir and the District Magistrate, Praveen Laxkar, say the young woman’s father is being manipulated by people with vested interests. Rajesh says his father is a simple man, which is why he is being pressured by the administration. On October 1, in a video that went viral, Laxkar can be heard telling the family that the media will be gone in a day or two, but they (the administration) will stand by the family. He can also be heard saying that the family should not change its statements so much that the officials get changed. Laxkar has denied the contents of the video since, but the video shows a lack of trust between the family and the administration.

Citing the autopsy and forensic reports, Prashant Kumar, ADG (law and order) told reporters that the victim was not raped. “The FSL reports say that no semen was found in the woman’s body,” he said. Haris Khan, medical superintendent of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, says the medical and forensic examination was conducted on September 22, eight days after the incident.

On being asked about the alleged delay in the medical examination of the woman, Vir also says it was conducted as soon as the victim told them about the incident. When asked whether the police could have asked the medical team to conduct it within 72 hours considering the condition in which the woman had been brought to the police station, Vir concedes it could have been done. “There are some systemic gaps for which we all need to work together but our intention always was to do the best for the young woman. I ensured that she got the best of treatment free of cost,” he says.

Shahid Siddiqui, Principal, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, says the young woman suffered a fracture in the cervical spine and a gash on the tongue, possibly because she had bitten her tongue while being strangulated. “As she and her mother didn’t say anything about sexual assault, we didn’t examine her. She had developed paralysis of the limbs. She was first admitted to the general ward but later, as her condition deteriorated, she was shifted to a high dependency unit and then to the ICU where she was put on a ventilator,” he says. Neurosurgeon Fakhrul Hoda says they were waiting for the patient to stabilise. “She should have been shifted to a higher centre in the first place. There was no point in referring her at a later stage,” he says. “We have all the facilities she required,” he adds.

‘They are all low life’

In front of Ram Lal’s house stands Sandeep’s house. Sandeep has been accused of murder and gang rape along with his uncles Ravi and Ram Singh and friend Luv Kush. Sandeep and Luv Kush are 18-19-year-olds, while Sandeep’s uncles, both in their thirties, are married. There is no male member in the house except for Bhanu, Sandeep’s brother who is a teenager. None of the brothers has more than three bighas of land. The women in the house refuse to buy any story about the wrongdoings of the men. “Koi bhi badchalan nahin hai (There is no bad character),” says Manorama, Sandeep’s aunt.

Hathras gang rape | Priyanka promises to help victim’s family

In 2001, Sandeep’s father Narendra Singh Guddu and Ravi spent time in judicial custody for an attack on Ram Lal’s father. “Ravi sells vegetable biryani in the neighbouring village and was busy with its preparation when the incident took place [on September 14]. All the rice went waste that day,” says his mother Rajwanti. Ram Singh’s mother Shanti Devi says her son was in the dairy outside the village at the time of the incident. The families say Ram Lal has become greedy and wants to make money over his daughter’s death. “He wants to avenge what happened in 2001,” says Rajwanti.

Bhanu says Sandeep was at home during the incident. It was Luv Kush who took water for the woman when she was gasping for breath, she claims. “He was in his field which is close to the place where she was found. And now, he has been named in the FIR.”

The families describe their neighbours as “neechi kaum (low life)” whom they won’t touch with a barge pole. When asked if Ravi would sell biryani to a Valmiki, Bhanu chuckles. “We sell biryani on a plastic plate and we don’t mix business with caste,” she says. The conversation reveals how entrenched caste is despite the trappings of modernity in the village, such as televisions and refrigerators.

Handling a volatile situation

Watching over the wailing women in the victim’s house, who all have their heads covered, are gods of the Hindu pantheon. When the body of the victim was brought to the village from Delhi, several people from other villages and members of the Bhim Army poured into Hathras. Many youngsters could be heard saying, “Yeh log bhatak gaye hain, humein inko line par lana hai (These people [the family] have lost their way, we need to bring them back on track).” The implication is that by sticking to Hinduism, they have strayed from the path of B.R. Ambedkar. The local administration feared that these people who infiltrated into the village would cause a law and order problem. Meanwhile, on the basis of the ADG’s assertion that the victim was not raped, the All India Kshatriya Mahasabha held a protest outside the village demanding that the rape charges be dropped.

Hathras is a reserved constituency in U.P. It is represented by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Rajvir Diler. The party holds four of the five Assembly seats in the district. The anger against Diler is palpable in the village. Though Diler is from the Valmiki community, members of the community see him as someone who is beholden to his upper caste patrons in the party. Like his father Kishan Lal Diler, who nurtured the reserved constituency for the BJP since Kalyan Singh was at the helm of the State, stories of Diler carrying his own glass whenever he visits the family of an upper caste voter are common.

On September 30, there were cries that he was a blot on the community. “If a Thakur offers him a chair, he sits on the ground. Today, we made him sit on the ground in a Valmiki’s house,” says the sister-in-law of the victim. It took him more than a week to reach out to the family after the incident, she says. While Diler takes credit for helping the victim shift to Delhi, the family members say it was too little, too late.

On his part, Diler says the administration let him down. “I was stopped at the Chandpa police station on the night the body was brought to the village. The District Magistrate and the former SP carried out the funeral without the family. Had I been allowed entry, I would have found a middle path,” he says. Diler says he has complained to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath about the high-handedness of the officials.

Shyoraj Jeevan, a senior Congress leader from the area, agrees with his rival. “The administration lacks maturity. It should have used people like us to build bridges with the family. They tried to handle a volatile situation by forgetting that the Dalit youth of today are assertive about their rights.”

Meanwhile, in the outer courtyard of the house, relatives can be heard discussing their experiences of everyday discrimination. Things haven’t changed since independence, they say.

Surendra Singh, who worked in U.P. Roadways for some time, says he was taunted for his fair skin when he joined service. “My superior would often say that I submitted a fake Scheduled Caste certificate to get the job. They could not digest that a Valmiki can be fair. It led to many skirmishes in the office and ultimately I had to leave the job.”

189,2020/10/03,Youth rescued from bonded labour reunites with family,"A 22-year-old youth, who was rescued from child labour here a few years ago, was reunited with his parents from Dharmapuri recently.

T.Meghanathan and his brother Sarath Kumar were rescued from child labour in 2012 by Childline and the police here. According to officials, Meghanathan’s father Thangaraja from Dharmapuri had taken a loan of ₹40,000 from a private financier in Mettur and he could not repay the loan. The financier took the boys for work at the klin in return of the money.

Based on a tip off, Childline and the police rescued the boys who were later produced before the Child Welfare Committee and provided shelter at Don Bosco Anbu Illam here.

Meghanathan after completing studies at ITI continued to work at the Illam while his brother dropped out of school in class 9 and works as a driver in Tiruppur.

Meghanathan recently visited Dharmapuri along with his colleague who hailed from the same district. He enquired about his family with the local people and managed to trace his parents. Meghanathan was reunited with his parents Thangaraja and Vijaya at an event held at the Illam recently.

190,2020/10/03,Residents protest at Aavin plant in Salem,"Residents from villages in the vicinity of Aavin dairy plant here staged a protest on Saturday alleging discharge of untreated effluents from the plant.

The residents protested in front of the Aavin dairy plant on Steel Plant Road urging authorities to take measures to prevent effluents discharge from the plant and dispose it properly. The protesters said that the problem arose mainly during rain.

Thangaraj, a farmer, said, “my farm lands near the plant have been severely affected due to discharge of effluents from the plant. Crops have submerged due to this. There are about 500 houses in the five villages and all of them are affected.”

K. Raja, president of Thalavaipatti panchayat, said they had been complaining with the authorities of the plant and other officials, but no action had been taken till date. Mr. Raja alleged that during rain, the rainwater mixed with effluents leaked through the walls of the plant to the vacant lands and farm lands in the area. Over 200 acres of farm land had been affected due to this. Theuthorities must take immediate action on the issue.

However, Narmadha Devi, General Manager of Aavin dairy, denied that effluents were being discharged. She said the problem arose since there had been a seepage from the rainwater harvesting ponds in the plant. Sand bags had been placed to prevent the seepage at the moment.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/residents-protest-at-aavin-plant-in-salem/article32762890.ece

194,2020/10/03,Demand to reintroduce two-way traffic system on Mettur Road,"Motorists, traders and the public want the district police to reintroduce two-way traffic system on Mettur Road as the increase in vehicle flow on Nachiappa Street is causing inconvenience to all.

The district police had in May this year introduced one-way traffic on the 750-m stretch of Mettur Road from GH Roundabout to Swastik Corner to reduce congestion and help the 108 ambulances reach hospitals without delay. Police personnel were posted on Mettur Road to prevent vehicles, including two-wheelers, proceeding from Swastik Corner to GH Roundabout.

Motorists have to take Sathy Road, Nachiappa Road and Meenatchi Sundaranar Road to reach GH Roundabout and proceed towards their destination.

The system has not gone well with the motorists, who say that frequent traffic congestion on Nachiappa Street is causing hardship to the road users. “While the entire one-way stretch of Mettur Road is not used, the entire stretch of Nachiappa Street is busy throughout the day with vehicle movement,” says M. Santhosh, an employee at a private company. He says the one-way traffic system serves no purpose to anyone. “Instead, two-wheelers and cars can be allowed on the stretch,” he adds.

Residents of Chinnamuthu Street, Sampath Nagar, Municipal Colony and Edayankattu Valasu say that they are forced to take additional four km due to the one-way system. “Our house is just 500 m from Mettur Road. But, due to the system, I am forced to travel for four km more,” says Deivasigamani of Chinnamuthu Street.

Commercial establishments on both sides of Mettur Road claim that their business is affected much because of the one-way syatem. Also, hundreds of workshops, shops and other establishments present on small streets in the area want steps taken to reduce congestion on Nachiappa Street.

The residents of Nachiappa Street submitted a petition to Superintendent of Police P. Thangadurai urging the district police to reduce congestion on Nachiappa Street.

195,2020/10/03,R.K. Naidu Layout residents urge GCT to repair compound wall,"Residents in R.K. Naidu Layout, Venkitapuram, seem to be worried more about what happens in the rear of their houses than on the street, in front. Their source of worry is the damaged compound wall of the Government College of Technology, which is south of the area.

Through the damaged stretches of the wall, anti-social elements and mischief-makers enter the college ground, make merry, consume liquor, threaten the peafowl and also the safety of residents in the layout, complains C.K. Banumathy, a resident and president of the R.K. Naidu Layout Association.

It is not just people from the nearby slums and even those from afar enter the college ground to create nuisance. The intruders disturbed the peafowl, set fire to bushes and after consuming liquor flung around the bottles, she adds.

The presence of such elements pose a threat to the Layout residents as they scaling the wall is only a matter of time, adds resident and doctor K. Karthikesh.

Ms. Banumathy says the residents have twice taken up the matter with the college authorities but were yet to get relief.

Sources in the college and Public Works Department, which takes up construction and maintenance of government establishments, say the compound wall is damaged and that the college has sent a proposal to the Higher Education Department to strengthen and rebuild the wall, wherever necessary, for ₹1.50 crore.

The proposal is for a 850 – 900m stretch of wall from the east on Thadagam Road to north touching Venkitapuram and R.K. Naidu Layout till the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.

The sources say the entry of unwanted elements also poses a threat to the students’ and faculty’s safety as well and therefore the college has reminded the department officials about the proposal.

The PWD sources say the reason for the damage to the wall has to do with the Coimbatore Corporation not having a proper outlet for the sewage collected from the R.K. Naidu Layout. At present the sewage stagnates on the northern side of the college, abutting the Layout and the stagnant water has led to the weakening of the wall.

Though the residents and college authorities want the corporation to construct a proper sewage disposal system, the civic body has not acted yet.

197,2020/10/03,Knitting up confidence for women who undergo mastectomy,"The prosthesis, which is reusable, is distributed free of cost to beneficiaries

Forty seven-year-old Latha (name changed), who underwent mastectomy, or breast removal, last year at a private hospital here, could not afford to buy a breast prosthesis. Her counsellor told her about handmade, knitted prosthesis and she opted for it.

Using the prosthesis since January this year, she says she finds it very useful. “I found it difficult to interact with people (after the procedure) and now I am able to move about freely and interact with confidence,” she says.

The knitted breast prosthesis is supplied by Saaisha India Foundation, a charitable organisation. Jayashree Ratan, founder of the organisation, learnt about the product and started knitting it four or five years ago. Saaisha India is registered with Knittedknockers.org of the US and is active in India since 2018.

Srividya Gopinath, a Chennai-based volunteer of the Foundation, says that since 2018 Saaisha has supplied about 1,800 knitted prosthesis to beneficiaries across the country. As many as 175 volunteers in India and the UAE knit the prosthesis and send it the Foundation’s centre in Mumbai. While most of the volunteers are experienced in knitting and crocheting, some have learnt it to be part of the cause. “We have tied up with a cotton yarn supplier. The volunteers buy the yarn from him, knit the prosthesis and send it to the Centre. It is filled with poly fibre and supplied to beneficiaries,” she says.

“We check the weaves and there is a pattern guide. We have made Youtube tutorials too on how to knit these,” she says. The average time taken is three to four hours for a knitter, some of whom are working women too. “Of late, with better awareness, there are two or three volunteers who want to come on board almost every day. Some of them are beneficiaries. We want these products to reach women in rural areas,” she says.

200,2020/10/03,Devotees sent back from Karamadai temple,"Despite the district administration closing the Aranganathaswamy Temple at Karamadai for Puratasi Saturdays to prevent the spread of COVID-19, large groups of devotees who thronged the temple were sent back by the police.

The Karamadai police said that over a hundred devotees arrived on Saturday morning as they were not aware that the temple was closed. Some of them chose to offer their prayers from the main road. Barricades were erected in front of the temple entrance and police personnel were deployed.

Sources in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department said that although the temple was closed for devotees, the Puratasi Saturday rituals were carried out.

202,2020/10/03,Two arrested for murdering man,"COIMBATORE

The Singanallur police on Saturday arrested two persons, including a teenager, in connection with the murder of an 83-year-old man, who was residing alone at his house on Tiruchi Road here.

The police said that Vikram (24), a taxi driver by profession, and his 17-year-old cousin, both natives of Karaikudi, were arrested with the help of Sivaganga police.

The accused, according to the police, murdered S. Krishnasamy of Singanallur by strangling him with a wire after assaulting him with an iron rod on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday.

The accused left the house in Krishnasamy’s car after stealing a few sovereigns of jewellery, his mobile phone and money, said the police.

Krishnasamy was living alone in the house and the murder came to light when the security guard he employed came to the house on Friday morning.

The police traced the accused to Karaikudi after cyber cell officials found that Krishnasamy’s mobile tower location was active at the place.

Coimbatore City Police sought the help of Sivaganga police who found Krishnasamy’s car on the side of a road near Karaikudi with a flat tyre.

The police found the visiting card of a lodge from the car which led them to the place where the accused were hiding.

The accused, who confessed to the murder, told the police that they had gone out to source liquor after checking into the lodge. They left the car after one of its tyres got punctured.

A police officer said that Vikram was recently remanded in a theft case and he came to know that Krishnasamy was staying alone at the house from a man who worked as a security guard.

Vikram and the teenager who was staying at Ondipudur reportedly observed the house a day before the murder and ensured that the elderly man was staying alone at night as the security guard worked between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.

After entering the house, the accused beat up the man with an iron rod and later strangulated him with a wire. The Singanallur police brought the two accused from Karaikudi to Coimbatore on Saturday morning and recorded their arrests.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/two-arrested-for-murdering-man/article32761145.ece

Sunrisers Hyderabad captain David Warner said on Friday it was nice to see youngsters back themselves after his team defeated Chennai Super Kings.

On the fighting partnership of 77 between Priyam Garg and Abhishek Sharma for the fifth wicket, Warner said, ""I asked them what was a good score and they said 150 and we got 164.

“These guys assessed the conditions and played really well.”

Warner said he had to back 18-year-old Abdul Samad in the final over when they had to defend 27 runs.

Garg said his confidence had grown after the knock. ""The plan was to play my shots and their bowling helped,"" he said ""There was positive energy on the field after such an innings"" he said. ""I felt very good in there, because it was a big stage with the senior players.

209,2020/10/03,Indian Premier League 2020 | Ishan Kishan seems to have come of age,"The Mumbai Indian batsman says he has worked on his off-side play

He may look younger than most in the Mumbai Indians line-up but Ishan Kishan is a seasoned pro, not just in the defending champion’s set-up but even in the Indian Premier League bandwagon. The former India Under-19 captain is featuring in his fifth IPL season, third with MI.

Thanks to his heroics against Royal Challengers Bangalore, a 57-ball 99 that helped MI tie a gargantuan chase, followed by a sedate knock against Kings XI Punjab that set the stage for the big-hitters, Kishan seems to have finally come of age.

The left-handed batsman has given indications of having learnt to play according to the situation.

“I was not good at playing shots through covers and all but I have worked a lot this off season and if I get the ball over there, I will go for it because it is something that every team plans for you,” Kishan said ahead of Mumbai Indians’ weekend clash against Sunrisers Hyderabad.

Practice is key

“They have meetings before the match, they know what is the weak spot and where they have to bowl to us, but it is important for us to practise about that in the off-season.”

Kishan admitted that being around the likes of Kieron Pollard and Hardik Pandya has helped him learn how to peg a bowler back and rotate strike but hoped that the smaller boundaries at Sharjah would mean boundaries will continue to be higher on Sunday.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/fvabqx/article32762257.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th04ishan,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kishan-seems-to-have-come-of-age/article32762258.ece
210,2020/10/03,Indian Premier League 2020 | Delhi Capitals win power-hitting battle against KKR,"Shreyas, Shaw take the side to 228; Morgan and Tripathi nearly pull it off for KKR

Kolkata Knight Riders’ Eoin Morgan (44, 18b, 1x4, 5x6) and Rahul Tripathi (36, 16b, 3x4, 3x6) turned a stiff chase into an exhibition of power-hitting, but their side fell 18 runs short of Delhi Capitals’ 228 in an IPL encounter at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Saturday.

With KKR reeling at 122 for six, Morgan and Tripathi brought the team back into contention with a pulsating 78-run stand. Morgan was particularly severe on Kagiso Rabada (one for 51), hitting him for a hat-trick of sixes in the 18th over, after Tripathi had collected 22 off Marcus Stoinis in the previous over. However, Anrich Nortje's dismissal of Morgan followed by Tripathi's wicket in the final over bowled by Stoinis saw DC home.

Losing Narine early

KKR suffered an early setback when it lost opener Sunil Narine in the second over. But Shubman Gill (28, 22b, 2x4, 1x6) and Nitish Rana (58, 35b, 4x4, 4x6) were unfazed and accumulated 59 runs in the first six overs. Rana was dropped on 27 by Amit Mishra off his own bowling. But the leggie made amends in his next over, getting Gill caught by Rishabh Pant.

Andre Russell briefly entertained, hitting a four and a six off Rabada before the latter got rid of the all-rounder. Harshal Patel then removed Rana and Dinesh Karthik off successive deliveries in the 13th over to make things difficult for KKR.

Earlier, after KKR opted to bowl, Shreyas Iyer’s 38-ball 88 (7x4, 6x6) and Prithvi Shaw’s quickfire half-century (66, 41b, 4x4, 4x6) had powered the Capitals to the highest total of this edition.

Capitals got off to a brisk start with Shaw and Shikhar Dhawan (26, 16b, 2x4, 2x6) adding 56 for the first wicket. Delhi had raced to 50 in the fifth over before the Kolkata side broke through when Varun Chakravarthy removed Dhawan in the last over of PowerPlay.

On the go

However, Shaw continued to flourish. The opener sent a Shivam Mavi delivery over extra-cover for six, and brought up his half-century — his sixth in the IPL — with a six over long-on.

Shaw and Shreyas then waded into Varun in the 12th over, scoring 16 runs. But just as they looked to switch gears, Shaw fell.

Pant then scored a quick 38 (17b, 5x4, 1x6) even as Shreyas got his fastest fifty in the IPL (26 balls). The 20 runs the skipper blasted off the last over was worth its weight in gold.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pkoqez/article32762102.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHREYASIYER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-delhi-capitals-vs-kolkata-knight-riders-in-sharjah/article32761159.ece
211,2020/10/03,"Indian Premier League 2020 | RCB vs RR: Chahal, Padikkal and Kohli star for RCB","Bengaluru side chases down the 155-run target with five balls to spare; Royals’ batsmen fail again

Virat Kohli (72 n.o., 53b, 7x4, 2x6) and Devdutt Padikkal (63, 45b, 6x4, 1x6) guided Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) to a facile eight-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals (RR), in an IPL encounter at Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.

The duo helped RCB reach the modest 155-run target with five balls to spare, giving the side a third win in four matches. Kohli, after three failures in this tournament, struck form with a steady knock. With two clean sixes off leg-spinners Riyan Parag and Rahul Tewatia, Kohli showed that he had regained his old touch.

Growing reputation

Padikkal added to his growing reputation with a third fifty in four matches. The southpaw scored a bulk of his boundaries on the leg-side, with sweetly timed pulls and flicks. The 20-year-old battled cramps late in his knock, before losing his stumps to a fiery yorker from Jofra Archer.

Earlier, RR recovered from a shaky start to record a respectable total. Jos Buttler, Steve Smith and Sanju Samson – the three key batsmen – fell cheaply, leaving the side tottering at 31 for three. A low diving catch at slip by Padikkal got rid of the dangerous Buttler (22, 12b, 4x3, 1x6), while leggie Yuzvendra Chahal showed great athleticism to take a tough return catch to dismiss Samson.

Robin Uthappa (17, 22b, 1x4) and Mahipal Lomror (47, 39b, 1x4, 3x6) rebuilt the innings to a small extent with a 39-run fourth-wicket stand. Chahal then showed his class, taking out Uthappa and Lomror with enticing, flighted deliveries. Neither batsman was able to get under the ball, resulting in catches in the deep.

Tewatia (24 n.o., 12b, 3x6) smacked it around, providing vital acceleration at the death. He survived a scare, getting hit flush on the chest by a fast beamer from Navdeep Saini. But Tewatia shook it off, and smashed Saini for sixes off the next two deliveries.

Chahal emerged as RCB’s most successful bowler (4-0-24-3), while off-spinner Washington Sundar once again returned miserly figures (4-0-20-0). With an impressive tournament economy rate of 4.72, Washington has emerged as an invaluable part of the RCB bowling attack.

212,2020/10/03,Indian Premier League 2020 | Chennai seeks turnaround in clash against Punjab,"Chennai are up against a side which has been batting well, though results have not exactly gone in their favour.

Hit hard by a start that least defines them, Chennai Super Kings would be desperate to find answers to their predicament when they take on Kings XI Punjab in an IPL match here on Sunday.

So used to be on top of their game in the previous editions, sitting at the bottom of the points table now with three losses in four matches is an unknown territory for the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side.

Nothing has worked for them despite having the resources.

They even made three changes to their playing XI for Friday’s game against Sunrisers Hyderabad but neither comeback of Ambati Rayudu nor the presence of Dwayne Bravo could lift the gloom.

A misfiring top-order, save Faf du Plessis, combined with inadequate run-flow in the middle overs and the habit of leaving way too much for the climax, proved to be their bane in the three consecutive defeats.

They have it in them to turn it around but everything — fielding, bowling and batting — has to come together.

When the result go a team’s way, many of the frailties gets hidden but even the smallest of things get exposed when the opposite happens.

The desperation was palpable on Dhoni’s face after the latest loss.

“Long time back once we lost three in a row. We need to get a lot of things right. It is the professionalism. We need to take our catches, not bowl no-balls. Those are the controllables and may be we are getting too relaxed,” he said.

“We have been a bit too relaxed at times. After the 16th over, we had two good overs but overall we could have been slightly better.”

CSK will need one of their top-order batsmen to put runs on the board and run-rate in the middle overs need to be taken care of, too. If that happens, it will allow Dhoni to find his feet.

Dhoni has batted under tremendous pressure in the initial games and the huge expectations make his and his team’s failure look worse. By the time he goes after the attack, the asking rate would soar to unprecedented levels.

If the team can manage enough runs in the middle overs, it will give some cushion to Dhoni and other capable batsmen down the order.

But the job would be easier said than done since they are up against a side which has been batting well, though results have not exactly gone in their favour.

Skipper KL Rahul and Mayank Agarwal have been in top form.

But despite scoring in excess of 200 twice, the Punjab side lost those matches because of their limited bowling resources. None, expect Mohammed Shami, gives confidence of stopping the rival batsmen.

This is exactly what CSK must look to exploit. They need to get Punjab’s top-order early.

Overall, CSK have better resources but they must utilise them to the hilt.

Teams from:

Chennai Super Kings: MS Dhoni (captain, wk), M Vijay, Ambati Rayudu, Faf du Plessis, Shane Watson, Kedar Jadhav, Dwayne Bravo, Ravindra Jadeja, Lungi Ngidi, Deepak Chahar, Piyush Chawla, Imran Tahir, Mitchell Santner, Josh Hazlewood, Shardul Thakur, Sam Curran, N Jagadeesan, KM Asif, Monu Kumar, R Sai Kishore, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Karn Sharma.

213,2020/10/03,Indian Premier League 2020 | Mumbai Indians have edge against Sunrisers Hyderabad,"Mumbai humbled Punjab while Hyderabad defeated Chennai in their last encounters.

Boasting an explosive batting line-up that complements their affective death bowling, Mumbai Indians will have their nose ahead in the IPL match against Sunrisers Hyderabad in Sharjah on Sunday.

To add to SRH’s worry, doubts remained over lead seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s participation in the match.

Bhuvneshwar picked up an injury on Friday night and was unable to complete his final over in the game against Chennai Super Kings. He walked off the field with the help of the team physio.

In the event the experienced seamer misses out, table-toppers Mumbai will fancy their chances more at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium, whose boundaries are much shorter than Dubai and Abu Dhabi and have been a paradise for power-hitters.

The defending champions, having humbled a strong Kings XI Punjab in their last game, are unlikely to make any changes to the winning combination.

Skipper Rohit Sharma is in sublime form and he can pummel any attack into submission on his day. Rohit has scored 170 runs from four games this season.

While the poor form of Quinton De Kock is worrisome, the prolific Suryakumar Yadav would be more than keen to convert his starts.

The biggest positive for the defending champions is that their middle-order has finally delivered with Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya and Kieron Pollard launching into opposition attacks with their big-hitting prowess.

Young Kishan has been the find for MI, after his blistering yet responsible knock against Royal Challengers Bangalore.

Given the abilities and power of Hardik and Pollard, both can rip apart the SRH bowling especially at Sharjah, where even the outside edges fly into the stands.

Mumbai are unlikely to make any changes to their bowling combination, with all their bowlers putting up a splendid show against Kings XI Punjab.

Apart from the pacers, spinners Rahul Chahar and Krunal Pandya have played their parts to perfection and will be more than keen to contain the SRH batters.

SRH will also take a lot of confidence from their seven-run win over CSK, where all their youngsters delivered after the big guns failed to fire.

The team management would be hoping that skipper David Warner, Jonny Bairstow and Manish Pandey are among the runs again.

Kane Williamson also is a certainty in the playing XI, given his ability to take the innings deep and hold one end up.

If the seniors fire, that will reduce the pressure on young guns Abhishek Sharma, Priyam Garg and Abdul Samad.

But if Bhuvneshwar misses out, that would mean more pressure on yorker specialist T Natarajan, left-arm pacer Khaleel Ahmed and star spinner Rashid Khan.

In that case, they will have to choose from their other pacers — Basil Thampi, Sandeep Sharma or Siddharth Kaul — but none can match up Bhuvneshwar’s skills and experience.

Teams (from):

Mumbai Indians: Rohit Sharma (capt), Aditya Tare, Anmolpreet Singh, Anukul Roy, Chris Lynn, Dhawal Kulkarni, Digvijay Deshmukh, Hardik Pandya, Ishan Kishan, James Pattison, Jasprit Bumrah, Jayant Yadav, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Mitchell McClenaghan, Mohsin Khan, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Prince Balwant Rai, Quinton De Kock, Rahul Chahar, Saurabh Tiwary, Sherfane Rutherford, Suryakumar Yadav, Trent Boult.

214,2020/10/03,Are you ready to kolam podu for CSK?,"Through its latest initiative that harnesses the popularity of IPL and the love for the Chennai team, Kolam Podu seeks to promote the traditional art form

If you are a Chennai Super Kings (CSK) fan then you would certainly be aware of “whistlepodu” – a catchphrase and a battlecry for fans cheering for their team. This IPL season, a Chennai-based group is giving this slogan a twist — kolam podu it is. Fresh from the oven, this catchphrase seeks to achieve two purposes — extend support to CSK and while doing so, draw attention to the traditional art form of kolam drawing. With fast-paced urban life leaving people strapped for time, the enthusiasm for kolam is waning in metros. (For the uninformed and uninitiated, kolam drawing is carried out with rice powder or chalk).

Initiated by Kolam Podu — a YouTube channel established to revive, demystify and educate people about the art of drawing kolams — its latest campaign is smart and peppy, and drawing people to take a fresh look at the designs in front of houses.

The strategy is obvious — use the IPL fever and the love for CSK to get people to think and talk about kolams. The significant part is that it encourages CSK fans to go beyond thinking about kolams and actually draw one to demonstrate their support for the team. The ultimate goal is that it would want people doing whatever they could to revive kolam drawing in the ways they deem fit

Chennai Super Kingskku periya kolam podu/ Tamil Naatu stylela sikku kolam podu/ Namma ooru baaniyila valaichu valaichu podu/ Namma singham dhonikku sokka kolam podu… so goes the first four lines.

“We have picked words from kolam and cricket to create a video; it has music by Swaminathan Selvaganesh, grandson of Vikku Vinayakram,” says Bhargavii Mani, who leads Kolam Podu. For example, sikku is a style of kolam that the YouTube channel presents in much detail.

Taking us through the campaign, Bhargavii says that after the song was ready, it was about figuring out how to engage audiences.

“Through my circle of friends, I reached out to a few dance schools and asked them to come up with their own dance version of the song. The brief was simple: download our song and choreograph it the way you want to and send us your version,” says Bhargavii.

Kolam Podu plans to upload a new video every week based on the responses they get.

“If cricket brings people together then let’s also try it through kolams,” she says.

They are also creating GIFs to promote the traditional art form. There is a strong motivation for Bhargavii to promote kolams. Following a medical emergency two years ago, she started drawing kolams as therapy, physical and psychological.

She had a stoke which led to loss of mobility for a few days.

“I lost a significant part of my memory too,” she says.

Turning to kolams slowly helped her bounce back.

“Kolam Podu was more like a happy project that I had started to get out of it and I want others to enjoy the benefits it has to offer,” she says.

A collaborative effort

A dance school in Besant Nagar is thrilled with the rave reviews that a dance video it has shot for a jingle to promote Chennai Super Kings, is receiving. What is interesting is that parents, students and the dance teacher collaborated optimally, though the time at their disposal was short, to submit the video to Kollam Podu, which is running a campaign to promote the art of kolam drawing.

“An average Bharatanatyam recital is four minutes long and here we had to shorten it to around 1 minute 14 seconds which was a huge challenge for us in the three days given to us,” says Vanishree Ravishankar, who runs Natya Samarpanam, located in Besant Nagar. She choreographed the dance with her daughter Madhuvanthi Muliya.

Since the lockdown, the school has not been conducting classes on its premises and they had to quickly assemble a team for the shoot. Seven students were ready for the rehearsal.

On Sunday morning, they short the video on the terrace of a student’s house in Kasturibai Nagar. Two of the parents shot the video and Vanishree’s daughter did the editing.

Vanishree says, “On Sunday night it was uploaded and we are happy with the results of this collaborative work.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/hzpd26/article32758041.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04dckolam1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/are-you-ready-to-kolam-podu-for-csk/article32758042.ece
215,2020/10/03,Nupura School of Bharatanatyam’s online dance festival takes off,"Manu Srinivasan is on a mission to propagating dance virtually

Nupura School of Bharatanatyam will host its annual dance festival — Nitya Nritya. This virtual festival will be held on October 3, 4, 10 and 11.

“Nitya Nritya is a common platform that brings several art forms together. It has established a global footprint as a dance destination for the thoughtful, future looking, young generation of artistes, who are keen to ensure the preservation and revival of our traditional idioms,” says Manu Srinivasan, the secretary of the dance school.

This year, the festival will include dance, lecture demonstrations and talks by eminent dancers who will speak on Indian Classical Dance: The Approaches and Delineations in Understanding and Perspectives.

Dancers such as Praveen Kumar and Vaibhav Arekar (Bharatanatya), Prateeksha Kashi (Kuchupudi), Madhu Nataraj (Kathak), Arushi Mudgal (Odissi), Kapila Venu (Koodiyattam) will be a part of this online event.

Manu, who is the daughter of dancer Dr Lalitha Srinivasan, the founder of the dance school will helm the festival. “The future of our dance and culture is in the hands of the next generation. We need to help these young dancers keep their passion for the art. Nitya Nitya also offers a platform for young dancers to share their vision, preparedness and perspectives for the way forward.”

This is the 32nd edition of the festival according to Manu. “It was started by my mother. She also taught me. I see her as a pioneer in the field of dance. She instituted this festival three decades ago to bring dancers from all over the country on a common platform.”

“This year we are going digital in lecture demonstration mode. The festival is open to any dance patron. We hope youngsters will participate in this festival, especially those who wish to take dance as a profession. As the festival is in the digital format, we hope young people will be able to engage with it.”

Manu believes there are pros and cons to online classes. “We might miss out on teaching the finer nuances online. Digital classes are good because during the lockdown it was the best way to propagate performing arts. We, as teachers too, are coming up with methods to make the process of digital learning better. This platform works best for the abhinaya aspect of dance, discussion, theoretical aspect of dance and the massive reach the medium has.”

216,2020/10/03,"Local BJP leader, four others arrested for running sex racket in Rajasthan","Party removes its Sawai Madhopur Mahila Morcha chief

Five persons, including a local woman BJP leader, have been arrested in Rajasthan’s Sawai Madhopur district on charges of running an alleged sex racket, which came to light following a complaint of sexual assault lodged by a minor girl with the police last month. Two government employees are also among the accused who have been arrested.

The girl, aged 17, alleged that BJP leader Sunita Verma had forced her to have physical relations with several persons between October 2019 and May 2020 and also took money, including her father’s savings, from her. The accused filmed the incident when the girl was allegedly raped for the first time in a hotel and later used the video clips to blackmail her, according to the complaint.

The BJP has removed Ms. Verma as the party’s district Mahila Morcha president after her arrest. The case against the BJP leader and her accomplices has been registered under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

More arrests likely

Sawai Madhopur Women Cell’s Circle Officer Om Prakash Solanki said on Friday that an accomplice of Ms. Verma had befriended the girl when she was returning from school. She later started sending the girl to meet several persons who allegedly raped her. The 17-year-old was allegedly assaulted more than eight times at different locations, Mr. Solanki said.

Those arrested include Sandeep Sharma, who is a clerk at Sawai Madhopur District Industries Centre, Shyoraj Meena, who is a peon in District Collectorate, and Raju Lal Raigar, an electrician.

The police were probing whether Ms. Verma had also blackmailed some other girls and forced them into the racket. More arrests could take place in the coming days in connection with the case, according to the police.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/local-bjp-leader-four-others-arrested-for-running-sex-racket-in-rajasthan/article32755989.ece
217,2020/10/03,‘Digital certificates can be submitted at foreign varsities’,"HC asks DU to submit mechanism for issuance of online transcripts, marksheets

The Delhi High Court has said the online digital degree certificates issued by DU in monolingual, English, unlike the previous degree certificates which were bilingual, both in English and Hindi, would be valid for candidates to submit to their respective universities in foreign countries.

Justice Prathiba M. Singh said, “It is ordered that both formats of the online degree certificates, whether in monolingual format or bilingual format, would be valid for the candidates to submit to their respective universities/authorities in foreign countries and the present order may be used for the said purpose”. The court’s direction came while hearing a bunch of petitions relating to the issue of DU students not getting their degree certificates on time.

It asked DU to submit the mechanism devised for issuance of online transcripts and marksheets for admission to foreign universities or for purposes of employment. DU had said in cases where there is an urgency for example, for admission to foreign universities or for purposes of employment, it is willing to devise a mechanism to address the urgent requests.

DU, however, expressed inability to provide a mechanism for issuance of online transcripts and marksheets for regular students.

It said that as far as online degree certificates for students who graduated prior to 2017 are concerned, there was difficulty in creating an online mechanism. Prof. D.S. Rawat, Dean (Examinations), said printing of degrees has already been undertaken for students who graduated prior to 2017 and paper degrees have been sent to the respective colleges. DU said students who passed in 2017 and awarded degree in the convocation held in 2018 shall be issued paper degrees in three months through their respective colleges from where they have passed. Students passed in 2018 and 2019 shall be issued paper degrees in the next three months, after the issue of degree of 2017 through their respective colleges.

The High Court, however, directed DU to give specific deadlines or dates for issuance of paper degrees for students who graduated prior to 2017, who graduated in 2017, 2018, 2019 and ones who will be graduating in 2020.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/digital-certificates-can-be-submitted-at-foreign-varsities/article32755860.ece
218,2020/10/03,14 arrested for stealing two-wheelers,"Police claim to have recovered 116 bikes from the accused

Delhi Police has arrested 14 people under operation ‘Eagle Eye’ and recovered a total of 116 stolen two-wheelers from them, said officials on Friday.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer) A. Koan said snatchers have been using stolen vehicles for their crimes as noticed in the past few months. He said there is a nexus between the snatchers, vehicle thieves and their middlemen. The stolen vehicles are given to the snatchers on rent or commission basis, he added. “It has also come to fore that the criminals park the vehicles around parks, drains and other parking spaces, instead of outside their homes,” the officer said.

Following this, two teams, named Eagle Squad and Eagle Eye, were formed to nab the criminals. The accused have been identified as Vikram (35), Rashid (41), Jogender (25), Asheem (28), Suraj (22), Manish (20), Deepak (29), Sumit (25), Sumit (25), Nikhil (20), Rohit (25), Amit (25), Yogesh (23) and Sagar (22), the police said.

On September 25, the police spotted two vehicles lying unattended in Industrial Area Phase-1 in Mangolpuri. The vehicles were found stolen from Tilak Nagar and South Rohini.

“Next, a trap was laid and after sometime, four persons arrived near the motorcycles. The accused were apprehended after they tried to take away the vehicles. At their instance, 10 more people were arrested,” Mr. Koan said.

During interrogation, it was revealed that the high-end motorcycles were being provided to the criminals by the syndicate for entertaining their girlfriends, on high rental charges, whereas the low-end bikes were being provided to the snatchers on commission basis from the proceeds of stolen and snatched articles.

It was also revealed that Vikram was the mastermind of the whole syndicate. He was involved in 89 such cases.

A total of 116 stolen vehicles, including 39 bikes, were recovered from the possession of accused along with stolen mobiles, countrymade pistol and live cartridges.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/14-arrested-for-stealing-two-wheelers/article32755841.ece
219,2020/10/03,Farmers’ outfit to stage protests across Haryana against new Acts,"AIKSCC to also seek resignation of Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala

The Haryana chapter of All-India Kisan Sangharsh Co-ordination Committee (AIKSCC) on Friday announced to hold demonstrations across the State intensifying the stir against the three agriculture Bills passed by the Parliament recently.

The farmers would hold a protest demonstration outside the residence of Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala in Sirsa on October 6, seeking his resignation and would show black flags to the leaders of the parties in the State supporting the legislations, said Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav, also a member of All-India Working Group of AIKSCC, at a press conference in Rohtak.

He was announcing the programme for protest demonstrations in a phased manner on behalf of 20 farmers’ organisations in Haryana, which are part of AIKSCC, a coalition of around 200 farmers and labourers’ groups across the country.

These farmers’ groups in Haryana will observe October 14 as the ‘Minimum Support Price Right Day’ and gherao Delhi on November 26 and 27.

Mr. Yadav said either Mr. Chautala should give up his position for the sake of farmers or the farmers should eventually leave him. He ridiculed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his utter desperation in the wake of “Bharat bandh” on September 25 against the pro-corporate legislations which no one had ever demanded and were being forcibly “bestowed on the peasantry already reeling under unprecedented crisis”.

Kisan Sabha state vice-president Inderjit Singh countered the “misleading” claims of Haryana CM Manohar Lal regarding the purchase of crops with MSP as there were caps in place for maximum amount of produce and other stringent conditions.

Mr. Yadav also addressed the agitating farmers at Rohtak’s Meham during the day.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/l0ylaq/article32755827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE03YOGENDRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/farmers-outfit-to-stage-protestsacross-haryana-against-new-acts/article32755828.ece
220,2020/10/03,"Seven months on, tensions still writ large in Shiv Vihar","Small-scale flare-ups and a general air of hostility strain the nerves of the already anxious Muslim residents in the north-east Delhi locality that witnessed communal violence in February this year

As one enters north-east Delhi’s Shiv Vihar, the dug-up streets are a reminder of the large-scale destruction witnessed in the area during the communal violence that erupted in the city in February this year.

Seven months on, the locals are still jittery. Adding to their anxiety and fears has been recent incidents of loud chanting of religious slogans for two consecutive Tuesdays.

On September 22, the local Muslim community submitted an application at the Karawal Nagar police station stating they hoped that the police would not allow miscreants to cause problems in the area. Based on this, police personnel were deployed at strategic locations. The last two Tuesdays (September 22 and 29) have been peaceful, they said.

“We have not forgotten what happened seven months ago... how houses were burnt and vandalised... how we fled our homes... and it looks like they are ready to repeat it,” cried Zarina Begum (63), who has been living in the area for 35 years.

A 48-year-old resident of street number 13 near Madeena Masjid, which was damaged during the riots, said that it was after sunset on September 15 when loud chants of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ were heard.

Second time in a row

Groups of men were seen holding saffron flags and roaming the streets. “We told our young sons to stay indoors fearing the matter might escalate. Because it had happened for the second time in a row, all the elderly women decided to go and talk to the people who seemed to be doing the chanting… where people had gathered in large numbers,” she said, adding that they went and talked to a resident who lives on a street close to the mosque.

Subsequently, police and Rapid Action Force (RAF) officials who have been stationed in the area since February were called in and the matter was settled, the locals said.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (North East) Ved Prakash Surya said, “Shiv Vihar is a mixed population area. One community was observing their religious practices, which was misconstrued by the other community. Respectable members from both the communities were called and their apprehensions were amicably resolved. The situation is absolutely normal and peaceful.”

Similar religious chants were heard on September 8. A teenager who claimed to have been part of Hanuman Chalisa recitals in the area for the past 25 weeks said they would continue the practice. When asked if he was aware of groups of men roaming the streets chanting slogans, he denied any knowledge.

Vandana Gupta, a resident of the area who organised the Tuesday recitations, submitted a complaint with the police on September 18 alleging that the worshipping of September 15 was interrupted by a group of people who threatened them and she is scared.

In Ms. Gupta’s opinion, the riots were started by the Muslims, and the Hindus only reacted. “If they had not started it, this would not have happened with them,” she said, referring to the burnt and vandalised houses of Muslims in the area.

Ms. Gupta claimed she saved the only Muslim house on her street and ensured the safety of her neighbours till February 26. But, now the relationship of the Hindus on the street with the sole Muslim family have soured, she added.

“Just to get compensation, they [the Muslim family] told police that ₹6 lakh and gold were stolen from their house. It brought bad name to the street and we do not believe that they could have had that kind of money or gold,” Ms. Vandana said.

Arti, another resident, said: “We are only performing a pooja, we are not selling arms and ammunition. They perform their namaaz anywhere anytime, why should they have a problem with us?”

Soured relationships

She admitted that relationships between the communities had changed after the riots. “There used to be a lot of exchange of food earlier, our kids used to address them as chacha, mausi, bua... but now there is hardly any interaction,” she said.

Zarina, a resident, echoed the opinion. “Hindu neighbours do not see eye to eye. These are the same people who gave us shelter when rioters were torching our houses. Their attitudes changed after we returned to our houses,” she said.

The community is finding it difficult to deal with the mental stress of the recent incidents, we have not yet recovered from the February riots and the subsequent lockdown due to COVID-19, said Muniza, another resident.. “Our children have yet not been able to find work. We were also blamed for spreading the novel coronavirus. People have only now started to rebuild their houses,” she added.

Imam of Madeena Masjid Mohammed Zahid, who has been supervising the reconstruction of the mosque, said that work started two months ago and it would take another month to finish.

“Cylinder blasts inside the building broke parts of the floor and walls. Everything was destroyed,” he said. Pointing to a poster outside the mosque that read ‘Ravaged in Delhi Riots - 2020’, the Imam added that masjids in the area are being reconstructed by Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, the largest and oldest Muslim organisation in the country.

“Most of the Hindus living around the mosque are friendly and warm. Even after the Friday prayers [October 2], many of them lined up outside the mosque for a religious practice to cure their ailing children,” he said, referring to an age-old belief that children can be cured of a disease if an Imam blows into their ear.

Most Muslims in the area are either running bakery shops or sew for a living; the younger generation mainly does labour work. A majority of the Hindus are rickshaw drivers, sell vegetables or work in factories in Gandhi Nagar.

Locals from both communities said people who run their own business have begun to earn slowly, but labourers and those doing small-time private jobs are yet to start to earning “proper” money. “Kaam halka hi hai (work is slow),” said 23-year-old Abdul, who runs a tailoring shop in the area.

Tensed atmosphere

Locals said the atmosphere of the area is always charged. Around three weeks ago, an argument over the shutting of an iron gate escalated to the point where members of both communities got involved, and the police was nearly called in. “Even the smallest of matters can lead to something disastrous here,” rued locals.

Gulshan (23) is concerned about girls in the area. “If the situation remains like this, none of our elders will allow us to go out to study or work. They still don’t. What will we do with our lives?” she said.

Members of the Muslim community claim to have lost faith in the police as well. “Whatever we say falls on deaf ears. This Tuesday, both RAF and police officials said it is only chanting and that no one has abused us,” said Akram Hussain.

“Lord Ram never taught violence. He was peace-loving and sacrificing. No religion teaches hate,” said Asmat (53), who is planning to shift from Shiv Vihar to Mustafabad fearing safety of her two young daughters. Two saffron flags were planted outside her house on August 5 — the day Bhoomi Pujan ceremony for the Ram Temple was performed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ayodhya.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/w58fsn/article32755825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27DEMOSQUE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/seven-months-on-tensions-still-writ-large-in-shiv-vihar/article32755826.ece

223,2020/10/03,Man arrested for impersonation and duping,"He swapped victims’ ATM cards with his own and withdraw money

A 28 year-old man was arrested for allegedly posing as an Army official at railway stations and duping people by asking them for help, the police said on Friday.

The accused has been identified as Sunil Kumar Dubey, a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Mirzapur area.

He used to swap ATM cards of the victims with his and then withdraw money from their account, they said.

On Thursday, a police team at Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station noticed two persons arguing inside a PNB ATM kiosk, said Harendra Kumar Singh, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Railways).

“The police personnel entered the kiosk and asked them as to what they were fighting over. During enquiry, one Mohammad Aslam stated that the he had met Dubey in the parking area of the railway station. He said that Dubey had introduced himself as an Army official and even showed him an ID card,” he said.

“Dubey claimed his ATM card was not working and requested Mr. Aslam for help. Dubey was also questioned during which he confessed to having swapped people’s ATM cards and withdrawing money,” the DCP said.

A case was registered and during interrogation, Dubey said that he would specifically target Army personnel at railway stations to seek help and dupe them by swapping ATM cards without the knowledge of the victims. The accused has been found involved in four cases. He was earlier arrested at GRP Itarsi, GRP Nagpur and New Delhi railway station.

225,2020/10/03,Woman held for duping people of more than ₹2 cr.,"Accused made victims invest in schemes

A 40-year-old woman has been arrested from Gujarat for allegedly duping people on the pretext of inducing them to invest in various schemes for high returns, the police said on Friday.

The police said that one Parveen Kumar Singh, along with a woman friend, was operating a society called Jai Maa Laxmi Co-operative Thrift and Credit Society Ltd. and running a shop, Arpit Cloth Store at Mandawali, Fajalpur.

They cheated around 200 people in Mandawli to the tune of more than ₹2 crore on the pretext of investing in different schemes to earn high profit, the police said.

227,2020/10/03,Director and agent of stock broking firm held for cheating,"Produced fake stock holding certificates to siphon off money

Director of Manoj Javeri Stock Broking Private Limited Rajdeep Manoj Javeri (27) and the company’s agent Anil Karkala Upadhyaya (53) were arrested by the Central Crime Station (CCS) of Hyderabad on Friday on charges of cheating. Mr. Rajdeep also owns Conard Securities Private Limited in Mumbai.

On August 5, Pradeep Yarlagadda from Film Nagar approached police stating that he and his family members had invested ₹7 crore with M/s Manoj Javeri Stock Broking Pvt Ltd and M/s Conard Securities Pvt Ltd of Mumbai for online share trading between 2017 and 2019, with the inducement of Upadhyaya as the agent.

The accused violated the rules of Securities and Exchange Board of India by not purchasing any stocks in Pradeep and his family members’ name, and diverted the funds to their personal bank accounts by providing fabricated stock holding certificates and fake contact notes, Joint Commissioner of Police (Detective Department) Avinash Mohanty said.

“When the complainant insisted on returning the principal amount, the accused persons closed their office and dodged the matter and caused wrongful loss to the former,” he said.

Mr. Mohanty also said that the accused had cheated close to 300 people from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, who invested their money in the company for online trading.

Upadhyaya and Rajdeep were apprehended in Mumbai and were brought to Hyderabad and produced before a local court that remanded them to judicial custody.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/director-and-agent-of-stock-broking-firm-held-for-cheating/article32762954.ece

A mother of two girls, she slipped into depression over ‘routine lifestyle’ and resorted to the extreme step, Narsingi Sub-Inspector Anvesh Reddy said. “She cited the same reason in a note found in the house,” he said.

229,2020/10/03,Patients with depression pushed to the brink,"IMH lacks specialist to assist in electro convulsive therapy; mental issues relapse in scores of patients

There is barely any relief for hundreds of mental health patients struggling with chronic depression and psychosis as electro convulsive therapy (ECT) or shock treatment is not being offered at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Erragadda here. Lack of access to medicines during the lockdown had resulted in relapse of psychosis, a disorder referring to a loss of contact with reality, in scores of patients in Telangana.

Sources at IMH said they are not administering ECT as they do not have an anaesthetist at present. The institute had only one anaesthetist for years, but she was transferred to Gandhi Hospital in the recent past.

“Since the specialist (anaesthetist) is not available, we are not able to administer ECT which is offered as the last resort. Imagine the kind of agony that patients with psychosis and their attendants are experiencing. Those who take care of the patients at home fully understand what it means to not have the treatment option. Also, we offer this therapy to patients with chronic depression,” the doctors said.

The institute is the State government’s tertiary care centre where all forms of treatment exclusively for people with mental illnesses is supposed to be offered.

A majority of the patients who opt for the government facility belong to economically disadvantaged backgrounds. One cycle of ECT at private hospitals costs up to ₹10,000. IMH remains their sole hope.

Role of anaesthetist

According to the Mental Healthcare Act 2017, ECT cannot be administered without use of muscle relaxants and anaesthesia.

Consultant psychiatrists, seeking anonymity, said that general anaesthesia is administered so that a patient loses consciousness. “Smooth muscle relaxants are administered which also relaxes muscles which help in breathing. An anaesthetist supports oxygenation in the patient. All of this is done so that seizures are experienced only in brain for a brief while,” a consultant psychiatrist said. The therapy lasts only for a few seconds.

Only adult patients are attended at IMH. Minors are provided treatment at Niloufer Hospital, Red Hills. Before providing the therapy, consent is taken either from the patients, or their nominated representative as per advanced direction signed when the patient is in a condition to give their approval.

Relapse and trauma

Doctors who attend patients with psychosis said that some might hallucinate that people around them, including family members, are plotting to attack them. In act of self-defence, some patients might become violent.

“Patients had limited stock of medicines till March this year. During lockdown, those in faraway villages were unable to refill their prescription and ran short of medicines leading to relapse of psychosis and chronic depression. We have seen scores of such cases in the past two months. We often have people pleading us to admit a family member who has become uncontrollable, but we are not in a situation to offer ECT. Hundreds of patients and their family members will be partially spared of the agony if an anaesthetist is allotted to IMH,” sources said.

Till March, the specialist who was shifted to Gandhi Hospital used to visit IMH once a week or 10 days to assist in the ECT procedure. After COVID-19, she got busy with coronavirus patients there.

IMH Superintendent M. Umashankar confirmed that they are not offering ECT as an anaesthetist is not available, and will resume after the specialist is allotted.

Currently, doctors at IMH are relying only on medicines to help patients recover. They said that when dosage of medicines is increased, some patients have side-effects. Since IMH is a tertiary care centre, majority of the patients admitted there experience chronic symptoms or mental illnesses. The institute is expected to provide advanced and latest treatment options.

“But the irony is we are struggling to provide decades-old treatment options and medicines. Means to perform Complete Blood Picture and CT scan too are not available,” sources said. It was published in these columns on September 24 that the institute has a shortage of medicines prescribed to patients with depression and anxiety.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/patients-with-depression-pushed-to-the-brink/article32762941.ece

232,2020/10/03,"GHMC demolishes Lingampally market, traders protest","Bringing down the complex and constructing a new one in its place is leading to displacement of over 70 small-time businesses

Demolition of the old Lingampally market complex in Narayanguda by the GHMC authorities led to a spontaneous demonstration on Saturday by small traders who had been running their businesses in the complex for decades.

Traders engaged in businesses such as vegetables, fruits, mutton, chicken, groceries, flowers, puja essentials, among others said the GHMC’s decision to demolish the existing complex and construct a new one in its place is leading to displacement of over 70 small-time businesses.

“This is unexpected blow during COVID-19 times when already the businesses are down. These shops were initially given to our parents, and later we have taken them over, and been paying the rent regularly,” said Ramu Naik, seller of cool drinks.

Starting from ₹8 to 9, the traders are now paying ₹870 per month inclusive of all taxes, he said.

Representations have been made to the GHMC officials, requesting for re-allotment to the same traders after construction of new complex, but the authorities would have none of it.

“They said the rent would be decided through fresh auction,” Mr. Naik said.

Construction of new complex is a ploy to evict the traders, as the authorities had failed to do it despite multiple efforts in the past, owing to resistance from people and politicians, another trader Srinivas said.

In 1997, when the complex was vacated for renovation, the space in the new complex was given to the same traders, and GHMC is discarding its own example now by throwing out the hapless traders and workers dependants on them, the traders said. However, Additional Commissioner, Estates, Yadagiri Rao said the structure has become dilapidated, and is prone to collapse any time endangering several lives.

Due procedure has been followed for demolition and re-construction of the complex, and once completed, the space will be auctioned, Mr.Rao said.

“As per rules, the lease cannot be extended beyond 25 years without fresh auction. In case of this market complex, it has been over 33 years,” he said.

However, the present occupants will be given the first right of refusal. If they are ready to pay the highest price derived from the auction, they will be given the space, he informed.

Construction of the new building with cellar, stilt, and four floors is under way with an expenditure of ₹4 crore.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/4wmchz/article32762912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY04MARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ghmc-demolishes-lingampally-market-traders-protest/article32762913.ece

Recruitment of doctors and staff was discussed at length during a day-long meeting attended by Health Minister Eatala Rajender to address the issues and deficiencies at various Health department units, on Saturday.

The department has various units including Telangana Vaidya Vidhana Parishad (TVVP), Directorate of Medical Education (DME), Commissionerate of Health and Family Welfare, and Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH), Telangana State Medical Services and Infrastructure Development Corporation.

While tertiary care hospitals such as Osmania General Hospital and those attached to them come under DME, district hospitals come under the purview of TVVP.

More issues

Requirement of doctors, infrastructure at hospitals, consequences for non-performance, prices of medicines and where is it displayed, counsellors to guide patients and other topics were discussed.

Mr Rajender has directed officials to address issues in the process of recruitment. He said that a decision on recruitment of vacant posts every six months through medical board will be taken after holding discussions with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Regarding non-performance, officials were instructed to change conditions to ensure that action is taken.

AYUSH officials were directed to turn their dispensaries into wellness centres. Currently, 440 government and 394 dispensaries under National Rural Health Mission are operational.

If only a few patients opt for a dispensary, it has to be shifted to Primary Health Centre (PHC) so that AYUSH services are available at PHCs.

In a press note, Mr Rajender said health is a State subject and that he has earlier asked Union Health Minister not to prepare and enforce one policy for the entire country.

234,2020/10/03,"Pensioners, farmers looking at TRS","Dubbak byelection scheduled for November 3

For the first time in ecent past, election campaign has commenced without declaration of candidates of any political party.

This is the interesting aspect of the byelection for Dubbak Assembly constituency to be held on November 3. The election is necessitated by the death of ruling party MLA Solipeta Ramalinga Reddy.

The TRS has already taken the lead in campaigning with Finance Minister T. Harish Rao touring the constituency extensively and inaugurating a series of development programmes and announcing sanction of various development projects to the tune of several crores. However, he has been cautious enough to float the name of S. Sujatha, widow of Ramalinga Reddy.

Cheruku Srinivas Reddy, son of late minister Ch. Muthyam Reddy has been trying his luck to get party nomination with not much response from the party leadership so far. It is not clear what path will be chosen by Srinivas Reddy, who has good following in the constituency due to the works done by his father.

The name of Collector P Venkatarami Reddy is also doing the rounds but he was not available for comment. During 2018 general elections, he had reportedly tried for Lok Sabha ticket but missed the opportunity due to last minute changes.

M. Raghunandana Rao of the BJP, who contested previous two elections, has been extensively visiting the villages and meeting people with a promise to grill the government on the compensation being offered to oustees of Mallannasagar coming up in Toguta mandal.

While the response to BJP candidate is quite positive from youngsters, the aged seem to be in favour of the TRS given the welfare schemes. “We are getting pension and six kg of rice from ration. We will be happy if double bedroom houses are also given to us,” says Laksmamma, who sells corn candles on the roadside at Chegunta.

“Farmers are with the government as they are getting Rytu Bandhu and Rytu Beema,” said Srinivas from Rukmapur village.

“Youngsters are looking at BJP as they wish change. They are not happy with the present government,” said Satyanarayana, a government employee at Chegunta. The Land Regularisation Scheme has also been getting severe criticism.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fnvfme/article32762454.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy04dubbakcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/pensioners-farmers-looking-at-trs/article32762455.ece
235,2020/10/03,Tough task ahead for Congress,"Probable names not keen on taking on the TRS

A tough task lies ahead for the Congress fighting to make an impression in the Dubbak bypoll, and more so for new All India Congress Committee (AICC) incharge Manickam Tagore, who was appointed recently.

Nothing much seems to be working in favour of the party in Dubbak as it is struggling to find the right candidate to give a decent fight. The party has lost senior leadership to the TRS before the last elections and has not found replacement despite the decent voter base. It lost its most notable face Cheruku Muthyam Reddy, who represented the constituency earlier, after the ruling party lured him into its fold a few days before the 2018 Assembly elections. Though he passed away, his son Srinivas Reddy continues his political legacy. Sources said an effort was made to bring him back to the Congress, offering him the ticket but in vain. “He preferred to continue in TRS with the hope to bag its nomination for the bypoll, or at least some political position later if denied the ticket now,” a senior leader revealed.

Siddipet District Congress Committee (DCC) chief T. Narsa Reddy, Padmini Reddy, wife of former Deputy Chief Minister Damodar Rajnarsimha and Komatireddy Narsimha Reddy, who contested in the 2018 elections are now being considered. None of these has expressed keenness so far on taking on the TRS in a bypoll that always favours the ruling party.

Not a write-off

The Congress vote bank isn’t worth writing off either. In the last elections, swept by the TRS, the Congress candidate polled over 26,000 votes and that too without putting much effort as he was the last minute arrangement after the party offered the seat to the Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) in the poll alliance.

“We continue to have the base and can improve our position further to prepare ground for the 2023 elections,” a senior leader said, adding “But no one wants to spend money now.”

“The might of the ruling party, sympathy for Ramalinga Reddy’s family and Finance Minister, T. Harish Rao personally managing the poll campaign are too strong factors for a decent political fight now,” he says.

The party has convened several meetings so far and is holding another one on Sunday as well. But it may not announce the name soon as the election date is a month away.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tough-task-ahead-for-congress/article32762451.ece

In one of the biggest seizures of foreign-origin gold in Hyderabad, the Customs department on Saturday seized 21 kg of the yellow metal at Air Cargo Complex of Rajiv Gandhi International Airport.

Officials valued the contraband at ₹ 9.5 crore.

“The consignment reached RGIA from a Middle East country and was being sent to Mumbai in domestic cargo, when the GMR staff found suspicious material during screening and alerted us around 5 a.m.” he said.

According to him, two kg is bullion with Swiss markings and the rest is in the form of 24 karat jewellery.

“Lack of documentation is an indication that it is smuggled gold and so far no one has come to claim it,” he said, adding that addresses on the consignment are fake.

237,2020/10/03,Pattana Pragathi will be true homage to Bapu: KTR,"Advocates improved infra to meet rapid urbanisation

Municipalities of Telangana should be examples for other states. A true homage to the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi will be in the effective execution of Pattana Pragathi, the integrated programme to transform the urban landscape, which also values cleanliness and sanitation, MA&UD Minister K.T. Rama Rao said on Friday.

The department, for the same reason, observed the 151st anniversary of Gandhi on Friday as Swachhata Diwas across the 142 municipalities in the State, he said.

The meeting Mr. Rao addressed here, after inaugurating a slew of projects for Bhongir, was also symbolically organised on the premises of a cleaned-up dumping yard.

Mr. KTR along with Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy, MPs B. Lingaiah Yadav and Komatireddy Venkat Reddy, laid the foundation stone for an integrated market, a graveyard, and inaugurated a bio-mining unit and a faecal sludge treatment plant.

Marking the day, he also launched the Pattana Pragathi quarterly newsletter and a public toilet monitoring application.

According to Mr. Rao, the State government is implementing a well-planned strategy in building urban infrastructure that also takes care of the future needs.

“In the next seven years, with a 7% increase from now, about 50% of the population would reside in urban centres, attracted by its better health, education and job prospects. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has a strategy in Pattana Pragathi and citizen-centric municipal legislation,” he said. Reading out numbers, Mr. Rao explained that Telangana since 2014, on the municipal front, has made significant progress.

“There are 1,327 nurseries, 197 dry resource centres and 140 compost yards, the one we are seated here included,” he said.

Mr. Rao said all the municipalities should aim for an open defecation-free (ODF ++ tag), a Swachh Bharat Mission protocol acknowledging sustainable sanitation, including faecal sludge management.

And to encourage healthy competition among municipalities, annual Pattana Pragathi awards on February 24, would be given away in various categories, he said. Bhongir legislator P. Sekhar Reddy handed over a cheque worth ₹1 crore to Mr. Rao towards projects.

238,2020/10/03,TSRTC adds very less to its city bus fleet,"While Bengaluru added nearly 2,000 buses since 2015-16, Hyderabad could add only 250

While Bengaluru added nearly 2,000 buses to its city fleet since financial year 2015-16, Hyderabad, during the same period, could add only 250.

A comparison of city fleets of the two State transport undertakings – the Benguluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation’s (TSRTC) Greater Hyderabad Zone – shows this yawing gap. Both cities have approximately the same population. But while the BMTC, as shown on its website, has a fleet size of 6,460, the GHZ has 2,982 buses.

According to data obtained by means of the Right to Information Act of 2005, transport researcher G S R Chaitanya found out that the GHZ fleet size has decreased over the years. While in FY 2014-15 it was 3,811, this number declined in FY 2019-2020 to 2,982.

Of the 250 buses which were added to the GHZ fleet, 52 were Super Luxury buses which primarily ply inter-State routes, but at times are also are used for intra-State travel.

Another six were inter-State Garuda Plus buses, and 37 were Rajdhani buses, which also ply inter-State routes.

Most of the city buses – five city ordinary buses, 80 Metro Luxury AC buses and 45 Metro Delux buses - were added to the GHZ fleet in 2014-15 and 2015-16.

Data also showed that while the average age of buses in GHZ is a little over 9.56 lakh km, it also gives an idea of how close to the bus scrapping age of 15 lakh km the GHZ fleet is. The age profile of the buses, also obtained by Mr Chaitanya, shows that in addition to 149 buses which have crossed this threshold, there are at least 176 buses which have run between 14 lakh km and 15 lakh km, and another 196 which have run between 13 lakh km and 14 lakh km. As many as 220 buses have run between 12 lakh km to 13 lakh km. In terms of age in years, there are over 600 buses which are over 15 years old.

“Buses are generally scrapped after running 15 lakh km. The data shows that there are several buses which are close to that 15 lakh mark, or have crossed it. It is only a matter of time that many will reach the scrapping age,” Mr Chaitanya said, adding that there is a pressing need to increase the fleet size in GHZ. He also explained that per Service Level Benchmarks for Urban Transport, there is a need to increase buses for every lakh of the city’s population.

As per the data, 634 City Ordinary buses have been scrapped since FY 2014-15. Again, most of them were scrapped in FY 2014-15, FY 2015-16 and 2016-17.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/5l1gga/article32755869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy02tsrtcRTIcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tsrtc-adds-very-less-to-its-city-bus-fleet/article32755870.ece

It was an invite-only event, but he didn’t push anyone to attend. “We encouraged people to watch the Instagram livestream instead, and around 35 viewers did,” he says, adding, “But, it was nice to see real people before me and hear them singing along — I could tell when they were smiling, even though they had masks on. Even if there had been just one person sitting there, I would have been happy to complete my set for him or her.”

Adil’s last line sums up just how much the city’s performers have been missing their live audience — the chemistry, the camaraderie and the emotional reactions to the very first notes of a favourite song. Which explains why, as a few of the city’s gig venues cautiously begin reopening post the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, artistes are raring to get back on stage.

After a seven-month gap, a TIGOM (The Internet Generation’s Open Mic) was held at their usual rooftop in T Nagar last week. The session, which saw about 10 participants — including rappers, poets, freestylers and standup comics — was a result of days of deliberation and planning.

Says TIGOM organiser Jaytesh Calpakkam, “We bought a bunch of extra face masks, just in case someone walked in without one, but thankfully everyone had their own. We capped entries at 30 people based on the space and did temperature checks. We sanitised the mic after every performance and had to remind people from time to time to keep their masks on, but it was all worth it. Because it looked like the audience had missed these performers as much as they had missed their audience.”

Standup comic Anusankari U inadvertently backs this up when describing her Psychedelic Hues (PH) Cafe spot: “It felt like a therapy session. Their fee was my jokes and my cure was their laughter.”

Not everything can be planned, of course — a sudden bout of rain during PH Cafe’s maiden open mic after lockdown meant that their carefully distanced and sanitised performance venue had to be abandoned and the audience shuttled indoors. “All our spaces are properly sanitised, but when indoors, people had to sit much closer than we would have preferred,” explains PH Cafe founder Rashmi Nandita.

Maintaining distance can be a continuous errand, and not just because of vagaries of weather. “There was a huge integration during the event as well, so we kept playing games to keep one-arm distance, and reminding people ‘if you aren’t able to clap freely, it means you need to move further away’,” says Jaytesh.

And then there are the brass tacks, including everything from seating arrangement to equipment. Goddy’s owner Godwin Roy breaks it down: “For our open mics on Mondays, we brought participation down to 10 people, instead of 30-40. We start at 6.30 pm now instead of 9 pm, and close early. Mics are what are used most frequently, so we remove and clean them regularly. Our amps are digital and operated from a smartphone, so the need to touch them doesn’t arise at all. Our speakers are on the ceiling, far from contact.”

During his gig at Goddy’s, recalls, Adil, “All groups that came together picked their own corner, two tables away from other parties.” Of these, one table was more special to him than the rest. “When at home, I used to go live on Instagram at 1 am. A doctor, returning home around midnight from his hospital shift, would always watch — he said it helped him sleep. He came to my gig that day and brought a friend; I got to meet him for the first time.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/jtlmwn/article32759541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3MPGoddys,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/chennais-live-venues-open-for-indie-music-and-comedy-again/article32759545.ece
241,2020/10/03,"Shankar Mahadevan, Zakir Hussain and John McLaughlin team up for a collaborative incantation","Innovative musical piece ‘Sakhi’ was recorded with Shankar in Mumbai, John in Monaco, and Zakir in California

The four-decade association between visionary guitarist John McLaughlin and percussionist Zakir Hussain is not just about a cross-cultural dialogue; their collaborations mark a unified journey to tap new terrains in music. Shankar Mahadevan grew up idolising these legends and as part of their band Shakti, he complements the geniuses’ musical outputs.

The song ‘Sakhi’, a production created during lockdown, is part of an album Is That So. Speaking from Mumbai, Shankar says, “In our journey of 20 years that we’ve been together as Shakti the band, ‘Sakhi’ was a piece that we used to perform regularly and we used to look forward to this because it’s calm and peaceful. John ji’s guitar riffs and lyrics by Zakir bhai makes it haunting and melodious too. This piece evolved organically.”

‘Sakhi’, an interpretation of thumri, peaks to a ‘question-answer’ exchange in between taking a different tempo and ascending like a storm and subsiding to become peaceful again. “It’s a piece that developed slowly and we just went along with it,” says Shankar.

Creating music, virtually

Is That So is a result of a small experiment that Shankar and John attempted. “We started it as fun. I used to do an alaap and John would harmonise it and we would remove the root notes of the alaap and use different scales and pitches, which is normally not done in Indian classical music. So it was a fun thing we started during our tours. I sent him one such piece which he worked on for one month and came up with something so astonishing that we then decided to do the whole album together. That’s how Is That So was born last year.” Apart from ‘Sakhi’, the other collaborative numbers in the album are ‘Kabir’, ‘Tara’, ‘The Search’, ‘The Guru’ and ‘The Beloved’.

‘Sakhi’ was recorded via ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) with artistes performing from their respective homes — Shankar in Mumbai, John from Monaco, Zakir from California. Despite recording from remote locations, ‘Sakhi’ wins with its seamless flow of spirit and the mood. Watching the video, viewers find nothing amiss. Shankar says it is very convenient to record from remote locations. “It’s easier to collaborate with the artistes. When you are recording with great artistes like Zakir and John, why would you want to guide them, you know they simply play their best. And the project will see the light of day. Otherwise, you have to wait for schedules of the artistes to come together, especially when they are in different places.”

On the flip side, Shankar admits there are disadvantages too. “There are two things we miss while recording from remote locations. While performing on stage we rely a lot on eye contact, a cue communicates what we are supposed to do in the next microsecond. So that gets missed. Of course, the hanging out before and after the concert, laughing at the crazy jokes, the beautiful lunches and dinners we used to order... the physical presence at the location is something we naturally miss. Otherwise execution-wise, we are not missing anything. I think the quality is pretty much the same.”

242,2020/10/03,David Guetta’s pandemic moves,"The EDM star on his latest number with Sia and how he got through the global lockdown

In his pre-pandemic life, one of the world’s most popular electronic artists David Guetta would be making tracks and catching a flight every 48 hours. With the global lockdown steadily easing up, the Frenchman has so far traveled to New York, Paris and London, but mostly stayed at home. “It was a big change for me, from being away from home most of the time to being at home 24 hours a day. But I also feel like I needed it in some kind of way,” he says over email.

One of the biggest names in EDM, whose songs like ‘Flames’ and ‘Hey Mama’ pushed the genre into mainstream, chart-topping consciousness, Guetta recently teamed up once again with ‘Titanium’ collaborator and pop star Sia. This time, they offered a feel-good track called ‘Let’s Love’, that delivers an apt message of hope and togetherness. He explains, “I was really inspired to make club music before the pandemic started and it definitely motivated me to start making feel-good music. I imagine this will certainly influence the DJ world when we can play live again.”

He says that during the lockdown, there was plenty of time to “continually develop” his sound, which is one way to avoid relying on formulas — even if you’re a Guinness World Record holder for the DJ with the most fans on Facebook and Twitter. “It has been great to go back to the basics. Creating new things is what it’s all about in the end. It feels like I’m really doing what I love again,” he says.

Album art for David Guetta and Sia’s song, ‘Let’s Love’

At a time when DJs and producers can only perform to audiences virtually – which cuts out the energy of a club or packed festival with pyrotechnics – Guetta still managed to leverage his following online to raise $1.5 million for charities working to aid those affected by Covid-19. While digital concerts are easy when you command a following like Guetta’s, he says there’s no “special trick or secret” that can help others in his field adapt to the times. “My only advice would be to continue creating music that you love and share it everywhere you can.”

He also released New Rave, an EP that heralds the beginning of what he and Danish DJ-producer MORTEN term as “Future Rave”. Guetta says EDM tracks have been “sounding the same for the past four years” and he wanted to change that. “Underground music which is considered ‘cool’ doesn’t have the energy to really get a crowd going on a big mainstage at festivals... We decided to put it out right away despite the clubs being closed.”

Balancing hard-hitting EDM that can turn dancefloors upside down with melodic, shimmering electro-pop, Guetta is striding with a foot in both universes. New Rave arrived about a year after he and MORTEN were working on music, so he promises there will be more to come.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/mzgz2m/article32759089.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/David-Guetta-Sia,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/david-guettas-pandemic-moves/article32759094.ece
243,2020/10/03,I have a child-like excitement each time I create something: Prashant Pillai,"Composer Prashant Pillai talks about his upcoming Malayalam film ‘Saajan Bakery Since 1962’ and his approach to music

With a discography that includes Malayalam, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Marathi, Prashant Pillai has always been at the top of his game, with his songs and background score. With a soundscape that is “mostly experimentative and avant-garde”, the ace musician has been making unconventional music for the last two decades.

Prashant has composed the songs and background score of the upcoming Malayalam film, Saajan Bakery Since 1962 directed by Arun Chandu. The movie has five songs, with lyrics by Vinayak Sasikumar and Anu Elizabeth Jose. In a chat with MetroPlus over the phone from Bengaluru, the 39-year-old talks about the working in the movie and the principles that guide him as a musician. Excerpts:

Songs of Saajan Bakery…

This is perhaps the first time that I have worked with some of the mainstream voices in the industry. Usually I choose new voices and musicians, especially underground artistes who’ve had their bit of fame and now are doing what they love. Since it is a light-hearted subject is lighter and the sensibilities are different, the tracks had to be soul-soothing. There was a conscious effort to present something fresh to go with the old-world tale that the film narrates.

Voices in the movie

The title track, ‘Once upon a time in Ranni’ sung by James Thakara [frontman of the band Thakara] is a throwback to the ‘80s and his voice was perfect for that. I’ve always loved working with him because he can surprise listeners with the earthiness in his voice. That was the texture I needed to give the retro effect for this song.

This is my first project with Vineeth [Sreenivasan] and it was Arun’s idea to bring us together. The breezy song [‘Thoramazhayilum’, a duet with Preeti Pillai] was the second or third version of the song that we made. There is an innate charm in Vineeth’s voice and this one complemented that feature. [KS] Harisankar has two songs and he told me that he has discovered a completely new side to his voice.

Your sister Preeti is part of almost all your projects...

We are like a cat-mouse combination. She being younger to me by eight years, I am the bully. I am tough on her because I know her range as a musician. At the same time, I have no issues in admitting that whatever I am today as a musician is because of her. She is a trained Carnatic musician and I owe a lot to those countless sessions we have had, with her singing and me playing the tabla. She is always there in my projects, whether she is singing or not. When we make a song, we become two kids singing in our home on a sultry day. We enjoy the process.

Food is an integral part of the movie and how have you brought that element into the album?

I am in harmony with food, if you remember what we did in Angamaly Diaries or Jallikkattu. But this might be the first time I am scoring for an ‘almost-vegetarian’ film…there is no meat in the frames! There are a couple of scenes where food is shown to have an emotional connect with the characters. For that we have treated the music in a slightly different way by bringing in a nostalgic flavour into it.

On song Prashant worked with AR Rahman after completing his sound engineering in Chennai. He then moved to Pune where he did a lot of jingles. He was the co-composer Bejoy Nambiar's critically acclaimed short film, Rahu.

His début film is Lijo Jose Pellissery’s first film, Nayakan (2010). Since then he has been part of all films of Lijo, namely City of God, Amen, Double Barrel, Angamaly Diaries, Ee. Ma. Yau. and Jallikattu. He has worked with Bejoy in his films such as Shaitan, David, Wazir and Solo. He has also scored music in Anurag Kashyap’s Mukkabaaz.

Among his other notable Malayalam projects are Chandrettan Evideya, Anuraga Karikkin Vellam and Unda.

Your creative process

I don’t stress myself to arrive at a composition. I do it naturally and instinctively. I just enjoy the process and if the director also enjoys it, then we have a song. There is no conscious effort to make it appealing.

On your writings on self-care...

I am a strong, intuitive person, something I got from my mother. I have had several ups and downs, which have made me strong from within. The lessons I learnt come across in my articles on my website [prashantpillai.com] and the quotes I upload daily on my Instagram handle (@iprashantpillai). In a recent article on the website I have talked about four easy steps to practise emotional care. Even if these methods may not be the same for everyone, at least it might open a door to help someone. I want to help people around me, especially those who follow me or listen to my music or who consider me worthy enough to give them advice. People message me privately on my Insta pages. However, I am trying to come up with another platform to reach out to more people and help them.

How has this influenced you as artiste?

I try to give the best and I am content with that. I know my shortcomings and to play to my strengths. It is about being true to yourself.

Your inspiration(s)

There was a point when I listened to several artistes. But now I consciously stay away from them because I have got the best of what I wanted from them. Now it is about self enquiry. One of the biggest inspirations has been musician Ray Charles, who was visually challenged. His story and what he has done for music inspire me to bring something new to the table every time. I have a child-like excitement each time I create something.

246,2020/10/03,One more Freedom Food Factory outlet opened in Kozhikode,"The Kozhikode district jail authorities have opened one more sales outlet in the city for promoting Freedom Food Factory products at affordable rates. Mayor Thottathil Raveendran on Friday inaugurated the new outlet, which was set up with the support of the Gandhi Peace Foundation.

Jail Superintendent K.V. Jagadeeshan said it was the fourth such outlet in Kozhikode, and it would function from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day. “Since the beginning, we have been experiencing a very warm response from our customers. Within the last one-and-a-half months alone, we could generate a total income of ₹15 lakh and credit it to the government exchequer,” he said.

There was good response from customers on the first day as about 200 packets of chicken biryani were sold within 30 minutes of the inaugural event. Officials said biryani was put on sale for ₹65 a packet. Most sought after items such as chilli chicken, egg curry, and vegetable curry were also offered at competitive prices.

Mr. Jagadeeshan said the new outlet would have all items manufactured by the Freedom Food Factory at the Kozhikode jail. “Apart from food items, it will have face masks, hand sanitisers, cleaning lotions, mineral water and washing liquids,” he said.

The jail authorities would also consider the online delivery of products. Besides direct sales outlets, separate arrangements would be made to undertake bulk orders for private and public events.

252,2020/10/03,Train services suspended on Pamban bridge,"Newly-installed sensor system raised an alarm of “strain” in railway bridge

Train services were suspended between Rameswaram and Mandapam railway stations on Saturday after the continuous health monitoring system raised an alarm of a “strain” in structural member of Pamban railway bridge.

“It could be a false alarm and our engineers are attending to the issue. However, we operated only the empty rake of the special train without passengers as a precautionary measure,” a senior railway official said.

Thirty-six passengers who had reserved accommodation with boarding at Rameswaram railway station were taken by road to Mandapam railway station from where they boarded the train, he added.

Southern Railway had installed sensors to assess the behaviour of the structural member under the traffic condition by fixing strain gauges and accelerometers. The project, executed by IIT-Madras, was tested in June-end during the lockdown. “Since the Pamban bridge is more than 100 years old, we are taking all precautions. Train services with passengers can resume only after clearing the doubts to ensure safety of the bridge,” the officer said.

Train services from the island resumed only on Friday after six months of lockdown.

A similar safety-related issue on the bridge detected in December 2018 led to suspension of train services on Pamban bridge for nearly three months.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ihki67/article32762159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA04PAMBANRMD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/train-services-suspended-on-pamban-bridge/article32762160.ece

Taking note of the submission that a petitioner who had sought a direction to permit him to continue his medical practice had actually possessed bogus certificate, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court directed the State to file a status report in the case.

Justice D. Krishnakumar also took cognisance of the fact that a police complaint had been preferred against the petitioner in Chennai. The court directed the status report to be submitted to the court on October 14. The court was hearing the petition filed by K. Jayapandi of Aravakurichi in Karur district who said that he had completed his MBBS and was running a clinic which was sealed by the authorities on the grounds that he was not an MBBS graduate.

In a counter affidavit, The Registrar of the Tamil Nadu Medical Council said that the Provisional Medical registration certificate possessed by the petitioner was not issued by the Council and he had not registered permanently in the council which was mandatory.

During the course of the hearing, counsel for the Tamil Nadu Medical Council advocate C. Karthik submitted that the certificate was bogus and this was also verified with the Annamalai University, Chidambaram, where the petitioner claimed that he had completed the course.

When the counsel for the petitioner sought permission from the court to withdraw the petition, the court declined the request and observed that it was not inclined to permit the counsel to withdraw the petition.

A. Chinna Durai, a retired orthopaedic surgeon belonging to the 1969-batch of Madurai Medical College, said it was only because of the treatment provided at Government Rajaji Hospital was he able to recover from COVID-19.

“I had a 70% lung infection and the doctors gave the best treatment for my complete recovery,” he said. He was addressing the media persons as part of an event during which the MMC’s 1969 alumni batch felicitated the doctors of GRH for their work in saving lives from COVID-19 infection.

Counselling for COVID-19 patients was provided in the hospital right from the initial months of the outbreak of the pandemic, he said.

S. Narmadha, a general medicine practitioner from Tirunagar, and G. Gunaseelam, a doctor from Palani in Dindigul, shared their experiences of recovery from COVID-19 after treatment at GRH.

Steps are being taken to ensure that all projects undertaken under the Smart Cities Mission are completed by March 2021, said Cooperation Minister Sellir K. Raju here on Saturday.

He was addressing mediapersons, along with Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan, after inspecting the progress of work at Kunnathur Chathiram. Projects worth ₹977.55 crore were being carried out in the city under the Smart Cities Mission, he said. The Minister said all contractors had been instructed to complete the projects within the stipulated time.

With the completion of around 95% of work at Kunnathur Chathiram, the heritage complex will be ready in December, said Mr. Raju.

260,2020/10/03,Babri Masjid demolition case: demonstration held,"Protesting the acquittal of all the accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case by the designated CBI court, the Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamaath staged a demonstration here on Saturday.

Led by party’s State secretary Syed Ali, the agitators raised slogans against the acquittal of the accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case in the demonstration organised in front of the Collectorate.

Raising slogans against the “injustice” meted out to Muslims, the protestors said the Supreme Court, while rejecting all the evidences submitted in support of the ownership of the disputed site at Ayodhya, gave the verdict in support of the construction of Ram Temple on the place where Babri Masjid stood for centuries.

Even as the Muslims were yet to recover from the first blow landed by the apex court, the CBI court, by acquitting all the accused who played pivotal role in the demolition of the mosque, had buried democracy and justice.

“Both the verdicts have unequivocally declared that the minorities would not get justice anymore in India even though the entire nation had witnessed the demolition of the masjid by a well-trained and well-planned mob, led by a group of leaders. This is nothing but burial of justice,” said Mr. Syed Ali.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/babri-masjid-demolition-case-demonstration-held/article32761502.ece
261,2020/10/03,AIADMK cadre resort to poster war,"Issue of Chief Ministerial candidate for the 2021-Assembly polls surfaces

Even though the party high command has gagged its office-bearers from airing their views in public on the party’s next Chief Ministerial candidate in the wake of heated face-off in the recently held party meet, posters in support of Chief Minister and AIADMK’s joint coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami have cropped up in some places.

Minister for Cooperation Sellur K. Raju stirred up the Chief Ministerial candidate issue a month ago in Madurai during an interaction with reporters and Minister for Dairy Development Rajenthra Bhalaji reacted against his views. Posters surfaced in Theni, the home district of Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam in his support, necessitating the party high command to step in to stop the poster war.

Though the party functionaries remained silent for a while after the dictum, posters in support of Mr. Palaniswami have surfaced in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai, apparently as the cascading effect of the reported heated argument in the recently held party’s executive council meet over the choice of next Chief Ministerial candidate. The posters had three different messages, all backing Mr. Palaniswami as the Chief Ministerial candidate for the 2021 Assembly polls.

While two of the posters did not carry the photo of AIADMK’s Tirunelveli east district secretary Thatchai N. Ganesa Raja, the remaining one, purportedly jointly released by three lower-level party functionaries, carried his photograph also, suggesting that they had his approval too. “After understanding the sentiments of grass-roots level party workers and the common man, who support Mr. Palaniswami because of his tireless work even during the pandemic, a few cadre have released these posters. There is no harm in it as it will not dent the image of the party where there is no place for traitors,” said Sudha K. Paramasivan, chairman, Aavin - Tirunelveli and party’s organising secretary, whose photos can be seen in the posters.

Interestingly, one of the three posters has been released by P.S. Muthuraj, former president of Keezhapaattam panchayat, is from the native place of O.P. Ravindranath Kumar’s father-in-law. His poster, terming Mr. Palaniswami as ‘friend of farmers,’ appeals to him to lead Tamil Nadu as CM again.

Mr. Ganesa Raja, party’s district secretary who termed the poster campaign as an “unapproved and isolated incident,” said every cadre should respect what the party high command says and there is no room for discussing anything in public. “I don’t endorse campaign of this sort as I feel everyone should strictly follow the high command’s instructions. The party, which is strong now, will emerge victorious thanks to the able administration,” he said.

OPS in Periyakulam

Meanwhile, the Deputy CM arrived in Periyakulam on Friday evening from Chennai. After meeting some of his loyalists, he participated in the birthday celebration of his grandson. On Saturday, Mr. Panneerselvam received a steady stream of visitors from various parts of the State at his farm house in Kailasapatti near Periyakulam.

On September 3 the accused allegedly stole cash from a petrol station in Punjalkatte police station limits. The arrested are also accused of stealing cash from two ‘Anytime Payment’ machines of MESCOM in Kotekar and from the office of St. Sebastian Church Institutions in Ullal on September 23.

“We are searching for two more persons allegedly involved,” he said.

Earlier, Satish Kumar, an office-bearer of the Dakshina Kannada Petroleum Dealers’ Association, in an e-mail on September 23 to Mr. Vikash said they doubted the involvement of the gang in the thefts at petrol stations off the national highways in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi.

Mr. Kumar told The Hindu that thefts at petrol stations increased after the restrictions were relaxed, more so in the last 15 days.

“There seems to be a pattern and petrol stations in secluded areas are being targeted. The accused are doing it early in the morning when there are less staff members,” he said.

The dealers, on their part, have installed CCTV cameras and other security gadgets. “We sought action to arrest the accused and also intensify patrolling at secluded stations,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/six-held-on-the-charge-of-stealing-cash-from-petrol-stations/article32760235.ece
269,2020/10/03,‘Report on landslips to be submitted by December’,"A 10-member committee has visited districts which saw landslips in 2018, 2019, and 2020

The Karnataka Biodiversity Board will submit its comprehensive report on the causes for landslips during the monsoon in the Western Ghats districts and the measures to be taken to prevent them by December, according to chairman of board Ananth Hegde Ashisara.

Addressing presspersons after a meeting in the office of the Deputy Commissioner here on Saturday, he said that a 10-member committee, constituted by the government under the board, visited districts which reported landslips in 2018, 2019, and 2020.

The committee comprised experts from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.), the Geological Survey of India (GSI), the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), the Department of Mines and Geology, and the Forest Department. It also had disaster management experts.

He said that COVID-19 had caused a delayed in the submission of the report and now it will be done so either in November or December. The government constituted the committee three months ago.

He said that biodiversity committees under gram panchayats in the State have completed the documentation of biodiversity in their panchayats. But committees under all urban local bodies are yet to complete their documentation.

The process is under way in some urban local bodies and in some areas the committees should be made active.

Mr. Ashisara said that the biodiversity committee of Sullia Taluk Panchayat in Dakshina Kannada has identified four forest areas in the taluk as the natural biodiversity heritage site for “ramapatre” (Myristica Malabarica).

He said that there is a need to identify more natural biodiversity heritage sites for fish and conserve them.

Mr. Ashisara said that the board has recommended that the State Wildlife Board declare “Tudavi” honeybee as the ‘State insect’, as it is is on the verge of extinction. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has agreed for the same.

The chairman released the final technical report on the ‘establishment of a herbarium and botanic museum of the plants of Western Ghats at the Dr. Shivaram Karanth Pilikula Nisargadhama’ on the occasion.

The chairman also released another report ‘survey, identification and preparation of report on sacred groves in coastal Karnataka of Western Ghats region’. The board had sponsored this project.

Both the reports were prepared by the nisargadhama and were submitted to the board this July.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/report-on-landslips-to-be-submitted-by-december/article32760186.ece

271,2020/10/03,61-year-old Joseph from Mangaluru cycles his way to fame,"The cyclist wins all four legs of Trek Century Challenge

Joseph Periera (61) from Mangaluru has become the only cyclist from across the country to have won all four legs — 100 km, 200 km, 300 km and 500 km — of Trek Century Challenge among 3,400 participants by Trek Bicycle India.

The country’s first ever Trek Century Challenge was launched in August wherein time limits of cyclists were tested in 50 days spanning four alternate weeks. The target was to ride a total of 100, 200, 300 or 500 kms.

Mr. Periera, a member of Mangalore Bicycle Club, was the Top 10 performer in the first leg and was among Top 3 winners in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th legs of the Challenge. By completing the last leg on September 30, he became the only cyclist across the country to have won all the four legs of the Challenge.

Ganesh Nayak, an office bearer of the Club, said Mr. Periera’s determination and dedication has earned him accolades while he was always a fitness enthusiast.

Despite the current set of challenges around, his zeal towards cycling kept him on his pedals and he has become an inspiration for many on their path to a healthy and fitter life.

272,2020/10/03,Wait for registration gets longer at taluk sub-registrar’s office,"Infrastructure crunch affecting normal working, says official

Senior citizen Vaman Nayak was waiting along with five other elderly family members since 8.30 a.m. on Thursday at the Mangaluru taluk sub-registrar’s office to execute a sale deed. His turn did not come even at 12.30 p.m., as the staff were attending to Wednesday’s appointments that were affected by server problems.

Mr. Nayak was among many waiting to get documents registered at the SRO, where nearly 2,000 appointments are pending.

While the government is encouraging senior citizens to stay indoors during COVID-19 pandemic, it is surprising they were made to wait in a crowded place, quipped Rajesh Kumar, a citizen. “The government’s apathy in addressing the issues affecting registration is deplorable,” said Surekha Rao, an advocate.

Despite the department generating huge revenue, little was done to speed up the process.

Advocate Manjunath said the delay had affected hundreds of people who were in dire need of finances. While many were going for mortgage loans to fight COVID-19, delayed mortgage registration had led banks to cancel sanctioned loans.

Taluk Sub-Registrar Basheer Ahmed told The Hindu that the office was crippled by severe crunch of infrastructure and manpower. “We feel helpless when people return without completing their work.”

Starting from shortage of computer operators to old computer systems, from flawed BSNL internet connectivity to repeated server problems, officials at the SRO were fighting many odds, Mr. Ahmed said. While there were only three government staff — the SRO, a second division assistant and a Group D staff — the computer operators work was on outsourcing basis.

Though the demand was more, the office could register about 50 documents a day under COVID-19 conditions where online appointments were given. “We have given appointments till October 21 and stopped thereafter.” Whenever registration was affected for one or the other reasons, the backlog piles up affecting fresh appointments, he rued.

District Registrar Raveendra L. Pujar said the system of one-time password (OTP) to prevent impersonation had led to some delay in registration. Attempts were being made to clear the backlog, he said, adding there was one month waiting for registration at the Taluk SRO that handles bulk of registrations among nine SROs in Dakshina Kannada.

No social distancing

With people eager to get their documents registered huddling together inside a small hall, social distancing as a precaution to prevent COVID-19 has been given a go-by at Mangaluru Taluk Sub Registrar’s office.

Members of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangh (KRRS), the Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangh (KPRS), the Democratic Youth Federation of India, the Social Democratic Party of India, and the Aam Aadmi Party did a ‘satyagraha’ in front of the statue of Mahatma Gandhi at Gandhi Park on Friday as part of a nationwide protest against recent Acts brought out by the Union government.

The protesters assembled near the statue soon after the end of the function organised by the district administration to mark Gandhi Jayanti. They garlanded the statue and sat silently near it for nearly an hour.

Later, addressing the protesters, KRRS State Secretary Ravikiran Punachha said both the Union and the State governments were working against the interest of farmers and labourers. The recent Acts by the Centre and the amendments to the APMC Act by the State government favoured capitalists, he said.

“We will not allow the two governments to implement it. We have the capacity to overthrow the two governments,” he said.

274,2020/10/03,Back to 85% of pre-COVID-19 transaction levels at CUB: N. Kamakodi,"‘Virtual banking during lockdown aided recovery’

Private sector lender City Union Bank’s business transactions have reached 85% of the pre-COVID-19 levels. The use of non-banking channels like Internet banking and mobile banking by customers was one of the reasons, said managing director and chief executive officer N. Kamakodi. Edited excerpts:

How did you tackle the challenges during the pandemic?

As banks come under essential service, we had to work even during the lockdown. Most of our staff members faced challenges in attending work due to lack of road transport and public transport system. We had asked our customers to make transactions via Internet and mobile banking. By coming to the branches, they were putting themselves and staff members at risk. It was a challenging period and the team rose up to the occasion and managed the situation.

Have you returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in transactions?

The business transactions have reached 85% of last year’s level. It is improving month-on-month as our customers are doing transactions through non-banking channels too.

How many of your clients availed the moratorium?

We extended the option to all the borrowers. At the end of June, [customers] accounts covering about 70% of the loan book, paid amount in full or in four instalments. Only 12% of our exposure [customers] used the moratorium fully and did not pay even a single instalment during that period.

How did you manage to keep staff in attendance while ensuring their safety?

We followed all government norms. Wearing masks was compulsory. We disinfected all Automated Teller Machines and strictly followed social distancing. We strictly followed government norms of allowing 35% and 50% of staff to work on rotation and others worked from home.

We encouraged customers to use non-banking channels like Internet banking and mobile banking. So, all these measures to a great extent protected our people. Out of the 700 branches, 110 staffers got affected by the virus. Unfortunately, we lost one person, while the rest of our staff recovered.

What is the new normal like?

Customer utilisation of Internet banking and mobile banking has increased. Regular meetings and staff meetings are happening through video-conferencing. Most of the customer meetings and investors’ meetings have also started to happen through video-conferencing. Physical travel has reduced to a great extent. Looks like the adoption of technology will be increasing as we pass the lockdown.

CUB focuses mainly on retail sector lending. Is that why the NPA levels are low?

It [retail lending] helped in a way by protecting us against increase in bad assets. As of June 30, 2020, our gross NPA stands at 3.90% and net NPA at 2.11%.

What were the CSR activities done through this period?

We donated to the PM Cares Fund and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister’s Fund. More than that, we supported the Thanjavur administration by donating bedsheets and blankets to COVID-19 patients. We continued our usual services on a few of our water conservation projects like deepening of lakes in the Cauvery delta during the lockdown.

What were the innovations during this period?

Among private banks, CUB is known for introducing innovations.

Earlier, people used to come to the bank to open accounts. Now, we have introduced Video Know Your Customer (V-KYC). It is picking up. Almost all transactions are happening via digital or non-banking channels and it stands at 90% today.

What about network expansion?

Last year, we opened 50 branches. For the current year, we have decided to put branch expansion on hold. We will evaluate it once the pandemic is over.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cri329/article32762757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THBUKAMAKOTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/back-to-85-of-pre-covid-19-transaction-levels-at-cub-n-kamakodi/article32762758.ece

278,2020/10/03,"After the Ohio debate chaos, the essential politics","Despite the parley’s dynamics, Donald Trump and Joe Biden did give some indicators of where their key votes lie

Tuesday’s chaotic Presidential debate, and the first, between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, was unusual in that it was not focused on a substantive discussion of policies, but overwhelmingly focused on the speakers and their dynamics. So much so that debate moderator Chris Wallace, who, prior to the debate had declared his desire to be invisible, also became a talking point.

Therefore any analysis of the debate (and its aftermath) must, rather than focusing on specific policy positions alone, examine other signs to get a fuller sense of the priorities at this stage of the campaign.

Editorial |

Suburban focus

It is clear that both candidates are reaching out to suburban voters but their conception of the suburbs are different. Additionally, Mr. Trump catered to his base — evidenced by his reluctance to condemn outright, white supremacism. His calling into question the legitimacy of the election because of mail-in voting also stood out in the debate. On the other side, Mr. Biden’s response to the charge that he was controlled by the “radical left” and his reference to his working-class Scranton, Pennsylvania, roots are indicative of the votes he is specifically targeting at this stage in the campaign: those in the middle class (some of whom have likely not decided how to vote) and working class white voters, who have over the years shifted to the Republican party.

Since Tuesday, Mr. Trump has found distance between himself and some key Republicans on Capitol Hill for his failure, during the debate, to condemn the ‘Proud Boys’ — an all-male group of “western chauvinists”. Instead, the President instructed the group to “stand back and stand by” before immediately saying that somebody had to do something about “Antifa and the left”.

Several Senators including Trump supporter Lindsey Graham and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell distanced themselves from Mr. Trump’s comments. Others, such as Susan Collins of Maine who faces a tight electoral contest also criticised Mr. Trump. With all House seats and over a third of Senate seats being contested in November, Republicans on Capitol Hill fear alienating moderates (i.e., those who are outside of Mr. Trump’s loyal vote base) and losing support among racial minorities. Mr. Trump walked back his ‘Proud Boys’ statement on Wednesday.

U.S. presidential debate | A fact check on Trump, Biden statements

Trump’s voter fraud narrative

The President, who trails behind Mr. Biden in the national polls, signalled, as he has been doing for some time now, that in the event of a tight contest, he would allege voter fraud over mail-in ballots. Americans are expected to vote by mail in unprecedented numbers due to the pandemic and there is no evidence that mail-in voting is associated with a significant level of voter fraud in the U.S.

Mr. Trump urged his supporters to watch polls at polling booths on Election Day. Critics have said this is tantamount to voter intimidation.

Other talking points

The President has also tried to get Mr. Biden to alienate moderates and undecided voters, who are particularly important in battleground States. He did this on Tuesday by repeatedly accusing Mr. Biden of being controlled by the “radical left” in the context of health-care policy and the Green New Deal (progressive Democrats’ framework for climate action and the economy).

U.S. presidential debate | Trump claims victory; says exposed Biden’s ‘very dangerous agenda’

Presumably, Mr. Trump’s strategy was to discourage moderates from voting for Mr. Biden, who is a centrist.

Mr. Biden denied he was “dominated” by the left flank of the party and that the party platform was approved by him and that he had defeated progressive candidate Bernie Sanders “by a whole hell of a lot”. Mr. Trump’s response was that Mr. Biden had “just lost the left”.

Several progressive leaders have since closed ranks with Mr. Biden. For instance, on Wednesday, Mr. Sanders told ABC that he was campaigning for Mr. Biden and that his and Mr. Biden’s health-care plans were indeed different, as per a report in The Washington Post. With regard to suburban voters, especially women, Mr. Trump’s narrative is that Democrats’ reluctance for law and order would impact suburbs. His administration has also rolled back some Obama-era fair housing policies.

During a debate segment on crime, Mr. Trump said that if Mr. Biden got to run the country, “suburbs would be gone”. Mr. Biden’s response was that he was raised in a suburb and that it was not the 1950s, so dog whistles and racism do not work and that suburbs were “by and large integrated”. (While suburbs are more integrated than in previous decades, most Americans do not live in substantially integrated neighbourhoods, as per PolitiFact).

U.S. presidential debate | Twitter removes 130 accounts disrupting public conversation

Mr. Biden has highlighted his working class city of Scranton as a campaign theme, contrasting it to his characterisation of Mr. Trump’s background: Scranton vs. Park Avenue. On Tuesday, he said Mr. Trump and his friends looked down upon Irish Catholics like him “who grew up in Scranton” and on people who did not have money (Mr. Trump shook his head in disagreement). Abstracting from whether or not this is a fair characterisation of Mr. Trump, this is the populist theme Mr. Biden has been pushing (it is true that Mr. Biden’s family did fall upon hard times when he was young).

On a post-debate campaign tour of Ohio and Pennsylvania by train (Mr. Trump flipped both States from Democrat to Republican in 2016), Mr. Biden reached out to white working class voters. In Alliance, Ohio, he drew parallels between the economic hardships faced by those whose factories risked closure to his own father’s experience of having to leave Scranton when coal mines started shutting down.

Judicial nomination

Also important was the discussion around Mr. Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court; the Senate confirmation hearings of the judge are scheduled to begin on October 12. Democrats and Republicans will use the hearing to show-case issues to voters.

Given how polarised the country is and how stable candidate vote shares are, there is a view that the controversy around the timing of the nomination itself will not impact Mr. Biden’s or Mr. Trump’s chances significantly.

Also read | Senate push to confirm Donald Trump’s Supreme Court pick

Elaine C. Kamarck analyses this in a paper for Brookings. Mr. Biden has maintained his national lead through this year of “unimaginable drama” — the pandemic, racial tensions, shutdowns and conventions. He led by 5.4 points in February and has a 6.6 point lead now. While these numbers are indicative of stable vote shares, they do not mean that Mr. Biden will necessarily win the presidency. First, polls undercounted support for Mr. Trump in 2016. Second, these are national and not State polls.

Winning the popular vote is one thing, winning the elections is another. As in 2016, the outcome might come down to a handful of votes in a few key battleground States altering the Electoral College arithmetic enough to make a winner of the candidate who loses the popular vote. The candidates are clearly aware of this.

279,2020/10/03,Pathways to diversity: On UN Biodiversity Summit,"As a biodiversity convention key member, India’s pandemic recovery must be greened

The UN Summit on Biodiversity convened on September 30 in the midst of a global crisis caused by the novel coronavirus that is thought to have spilled over to humans from an animal reservoir. In New York, member-nations of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) took note of the link between biodiversity loss and the spread of animal pathogens, calling for an end to destructive industrial and commercial practices. There is consensus that conservation targets set a decade ago in Aichi, Japan, to be achieved by 2020, have spectacularly failed. Evidence is presented by the latest UN Global Biodiversity Outlook 5 report: none of the 20 targets has been fully met. Many countries have chosen to ignore the connection between biodiversity and well-being, and depleted ecological capital in pursuit of financial prosperity. Among the Aichi targets that fell by the wayside are those on reform or phasing out of subsidies that erode biodiversity, steps for resource use within safe ecological limits, preventing industrial fisheries from destroying threatened species and vulnerable ecosystems, and an end to pollution, including growing plastic waste. A bright spot is the partial progress made on protecting surface and subsurface water, inland, coastal and marine areas. But the losses appear even more stark from WWF’s Living Planet Index, which points to precipitous declines in vertebrate populations, a key indicator, by 68% over 1970 levels. Faced with fast-eroding ecosystem health, the 196 CBD member-countries must chart a greener course, aligning it with the Paris Agreement, which has a significant impact on the health of flora and fauna.

At Wednesday’s summit, India’s message was one of pride in an ancient conservation tradition, as one of the few megadiverse countries, and one that recognised the value of nature as much as the destructive impact of unregulated resources exploitation. National laws of the 1970s and 1980s have indeed shielded islands of biodiversity, particularly in about 5% of the country’s land designated as protected areas, but they are today seen as irritants to speedy extraction of natural resources. In this unseemly hurry, due process is sought to be dispensed with, as envisaged by the new EIA norms proposed by the NDA government. There is little concern for indigenous communities that have fostered biodiversity, and no effort to make them strong partners in improving the health of forests and buffer zones. Now that CBD members are set to draw up fresh conservation targets to be finalised next year, India too has the opportunity to plan a trajectory of green growth after COVID-19, around clean energy, ecological agriculture, a freeze on expansion of mining and dam-building, resource recovery from waste, and regeneration of arid lands. It should join the coalition of the enlightened.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pathways-to-diversity-the-hindu-editorial-on-un-biodiversity-summit/article32754839.ece

Moreover, the accused is the nephew of an MLA and the object of the offence is serious in nature” he said.

The sessions court also rejected bail pleas of many other accused who were arrested for the violence in D.J. Halli and K.J. Halli. “The accused arrested in the case are part of the conspiracy to attack the system and create fear psychosis in the city,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dj-halli-violence-mlas-nephew-denied-bail/article32762445.ece
281,2020/10/03,Big surge in demand for bicycles in Bengaluru,"Cycle repair shops also see rise in customers.

The humble cycle has become increasingly popular among people who are hesitant to travel in public transport. Not only are retailers reporting a surge in bicycle sales, but repair shops are also seeing an increasing number of people bringing in their old two-wheelers for an overhaul.

According to retailers, there has been a steady rise in bicycle sales in the city from May this year. Krishnasamy Devraj, director, Cycle World, which has 17 showrooms across the city, said that there was at least a 20-25% rise in sales in almost all the showrooms. “Compared to June 2019, we had a 300% increase in sales this June. As of now, the demand is outstripping supply. It will continue to be high for at least another six months. Adult and premier bicycles are seeing a huge demand and there are more takers for electric bikes too. Many are using these two-wheelers to commute to work,” he said.

As a result of the demand, the supply has also been hit. Roshan Kini, founder of Bums on the Saddle, reported a dip in supply of components as well. On the trend of people turning to cycles, he said, “This is happening across the world and the trend will definitely continue. I have been promoting cycling for 14 years now, and have never seen such demand and response,” he said.

Mr. Kini also said that people have started cycling for fun as well as for fitness. “I think there has been a shift in the mindset of people after the pandemic. People are more focussed on health and fitness,” he added. Initiatives by the authorities here in setting up cycle lanes have also given a boost to this trend.

Repair shops busy

It’s not just the well-heeled who have turned to cycles. Many cycle repair shops that The Hindu spoke to said their “days are packed” as people from all walks of life are coming to them. Venkatesh. K.B., who owns a bike repair shop in K. R Puram, said that there has been a surge in demand for spare parts and cycle pumps, apart from repair requests. “I have been in the business for over three decades and I have never seen such enthusiasm for cycles,” he said.

And while buses and metro trains are not running at peak capacity, the same cannot be said for rental bike companies. Amit Gupta, CEO, Yulu, said that the average distance and time travelled on their two-wheelers has increased. “Soon after lockdown restrictions were eased, we deployed over 70% of our electric vehicles on the road, the response was good,” he said, adding that people have started using Yulu even for grocery shopping.

There has been a steady increase in enquiries about bicycle tours and rallies in the city. Bengaluru’s Bicycle Mayor Sathya Shankaran said that cycling clubs in the city are flooded with such enquiries.“Many apartment complexes are now starting their own bicycling groups,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/m9y068/article32762379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGCYCLEP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/big-surge-in-demand-forbicycles-in-bengaluru/article32762380.ece
282,2020/10/03,BBMP repatriates chief account officer for dereliction of duty,"Contractors had complained of violation of rules in payments

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Saturday repatriated R. Govindraj, chief account officer, for alleged dereliction of duty and violation of rules in paying bills to contractors. The office of the chief account officer has been sealed and an inquiry has been ordered.

The BBMP Contractors’ Association had complained to authorities saying that Govindraj was violating rules and not prioritising those who had completed the works while paying their bills.

According to sources, the officer had cleared bills of crores of rupees without bringing them to the notice of the special commissioner (finance) and the commissioner. “Such transactions regarding payment of bills should be made through IFMS software to only those contractors who have completed the work. But the officer directly paid it offline,” said a senior civic official.

Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said, “Based on primary inspection, it has been found that the officer violated various rules. We have immediately repatriated him to his parent agency. We are investigating the matter and based on the report, we will take further action,”

He added that from September 1 to 15, around ₹7.6 crore was paid under commissioner category without even bringing it to the notice of the commissioner.

Ward-level meetings

Following the end of the tenure of the BBMP council, senior officials of the BBMP, who have been appointed as nodal officers, held ward-level meetings on Saturday. According to Mr. Prasad, around 165 wards conducted the meetings.

Citizens who participated in the meetings raised various issues, including black spots, lack of compliance in wearing masks properly and repair of street lights. A citizen, who had participated in the meeting in Vasanthnagar ward, said that the BBMP Commissioner took part in the meeting and directed officials to fix problems in the ward. “We hope such meetings continue and we do not face any problem owing to the absence of elected representatives,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fhmsyr/article32762346.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGBBMPP3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-repatriates-chief-account-officer-for-dereliction-of-duty/article32762347.ece
283,2020/10/03,Hospitals allege harassment by BBMP officer,"Nearly 25 private hospitals in Bommanahalli zone threaten to shut down

Alleging harassment by the zonal BBMP nodal officer for hospital management, heads of nearly 25 private hospitals in Bommanahalli zone have threatened to shut their hospitals and stage a protest in front of Vidhana Soudha on Tuesday.

The hospital owners will meet BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad on Monday and submit a written complaint. “We will also submit a complaint to the health department and stage a protest on Tuesday,” said C. Vishwanath Reddy of Prashanth Hospital.

“Although we have been the first to offer our entire 100-bed hospital for COVID-19 management in the city, the BBMP nodal officer has been harassing us over the last one month. He has been making unreasonable demands asking us to submit various documents within 24 hours, which is practically impossible,” he said.

Vinay B.G., who runs Supra Hospital, said, “While we are not objecting to the show cause notices issued to our hospital regarding COVID-19 deaths, the officer has been asking us to submit discharge summary and death summary of patients from July 2015 onwards within 24 hours. How is this possible?”

Denying the allegations, the nodal officer Narayanswamy said he is only following the decisions made by the Bommanahalli BBMP command centre. “We are taking up a death audit as we learnt that many doctors, who are not qualified, treated patients resulting in their death. Moreover, these hospitals have defaulted on property tax payment. Hence, I have asked for these documents. It is not harassment,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hospitals-allege-harassment-by-bbmp-officer/article32762323.ece
284,2020/10/03,Two elephants die near Bannerghatta National Park,"Conservationists blame illegal electric fencing on private properties

Amidst a raging debate over reduction of the Eco Sensitive Zone (ESZ) of the Bannerghatta National Park (BNP), two elephants were found dead in the Kodihalli range adjacent to the park on Saturday.

Prashant Shankhinamath, DCF, Bannerghatta National Park, told The Hindu that the two elephants were found in a water body bordering the park’s Kodihalli range. “Preliminary investigations indicate electrocution. We will have to wait for the postmortem report,” he said.

Police officials said they were not aware of the incident.

The spot where the elephants were found is outside the park’s area. “Both elephants are female, and they look like adults, but the bodies are bloated,” he added.

Members of the Bannerghatta Nature Conservation Trust allege that illegal electric fencing on private properties outside the park caused the death. “Proper elephant fencing will only repel the animals. Ones with strong current will cause death. This is a crucial elephant corridor, which is under threat due to reduction of the eco sensitive zone, and wildlife is suffering,” said a member.

Earlier this year, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) approved reduction of the ESZ of the BNP by around 100 sq. km. The March 11 gazette notification had notified an area “to an extent varying from 100 metres to 1 kilometre around the boundary of Bannerghatta National Park, in Bengaluru and Ramanagara districts as the Bannerghatta National Park Eco Sensitive Zone.”

The area of the ESZ was mentioned as 168.84 sq.km. while the first draft notification issued in 2016 had marked an ESZ area of 268.9 sq.km.

Though the Central government had issued a second draft notification reducing the area by around 100 sq.km. in October 2018, in August 2019, the ministry asked Karnataka to reconsider the 2016 notification.

The Trust has argued that reduction in the ESZ will allow stone quarries and crushing units to continue, and that there are key corridors with Cauvery North Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu and Cauvery Sanctuary in Karnataka around.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/h24j0m/article32762181.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGFILEPICP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/two-elephants-die-near-bannerghatta-national-park/article32762182.ece
285,2020/10/03,Post-lockdown property sales bring relief to real estate sector,"The housing sector made a ‘decisive comeback’ in the third quarter of 2020 - June to September

Amidst a pandemic marked by job losses, pay cuts and health scare, the real estate sector was ailing. Added to this was a labour shortage following a mass exodus of migrant workers from big cities back to their hometowns. But the last quarter, people in the sector said, has brought major relief. Property sales, particularly in the big cities, have reportedly picked up, mainly buoyed by the housing sector.

Kishore Jain, president, CREDAI Bengaluru, said the last quarter was ‘very good’, considering April to June was a ‘disaster’. “Things have picked up. Serious buyers are in the market. There is renewed interest in ready to move in properties,” he said.

According to property consultants ANAROCK, the housing sector made a “decisive comeback” in the third quarter of 2020 - June to September.

“The top 7 cities witnessed housing sales of approximately 29,520 units in Q3 2020 as against 45,200 units in the pre-COVID-19 quarter of Q1 2020. Sales were significantly higher than the preceding quarter, when the coronavirus pandemic had brought sales down to just 12,730 units,” a report from the company said. Its chairman, Anuj Puri, said Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Bengaluru, NCR and Pune accounted for 84% of the sales in the quarter.

“MMR saw maximum sale of 9,200 units, followed by Bengaluru with 5,400 units, NCR with 5,200 units and Pune with 4,850 units. In terms of new launches, the top seven cities witnessed supply of approximately 32,530 units in Q3 2020 as against 41,220 units in Q1 2020 – reaching over 79% of the pre-COVID-19 quarter levels. Most new launches in the quarter happened virtually,” he said.

The seven cities recorded new launches of around 32,530 units in Q3 2020 as opposed to 41,220 units in pre-COVID-19 quarter of Q1 2020, reaching nearly 79% of the pre-COVID-19 quarter. However, there is a massive jump over the previous quarter of Q2 2020 that saw merely 1,390 units being launched. Key cities contributing to Q3 2020 new unit launches included MMR, NCR, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad, the report added.

Mr. Jain said multiple reasons have contributed to the development. “Before this, few people gave importance to their residence; it was like a bed and breakfast. After work from home, for the first time, some things may have been noticed. People started looking for a sense of belongingness and comfort, savings and investment. Secondly, it is the best time to buy a property. The prices are rock bottom and interest rates as low as probably in 2003,” he explained, adding that commercial real estate deals were also beginning to get renewed.

Property consultants and realtors expect the trend to continue, especially for residential real estate, even predicting a supply-demand mismatch next year due to fewer new launches.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/iwbj22/article32761942.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGPROPERTYP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/post-lockdown-property-sales-bring-relief-to-real-estate-sector/article32761943.ece

287,2020/10/03,Murphy Town corporation ground to be renovated,"It will get drainage facilities, a sports complex with washrooms, dressing rooms, meeting rooms as well as a fitness centre

If everything goes as planned, residents and sports enthusiasts living in Murphy Town will get to enjoy a renovated corporation ground by Independence Day next year. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will be undertaking work at the ground near Halusuru – popularly called Ambedkar playground – at an estimated cost of ₹7 crore.

The ground is currently used by people and school children to play cricket, football and hockey, and even walking. School children also use the ground. Its renovation has been a long-pending demand, said residents.

As part of the plan, the civic body will install proper drainage facilities, and build a sports complex with washrooms, dressing rooms, meeting rooms as well as a fitness centre.

The renovation work was not without its share of controversy. According to sources, the initial plan was to convert the multi-sports ground into a football stadium with a commercial complex. This was vehemently opposed by residents who approached their MLA S. Raghu.

After several meetings, locals were assured that the ground will not be converted into a stadium.

“We have taken everyone into consideration. We have decided to do away with the commercial complex as insisted by the locals. The first phase of the work is expected to be completed by April 14 next year. All the works will be completed by August 15, 2021,” said Mr. Raghu.

Not everyone is happy with this development. Many residents are worried about whether they will have access to the facilities when it is finally revamped, or whether it will be taken over by a private entity.

Others pointed out that the fitness centre will eat into the actual playground.

P. Muralidharan, general secretary, Murphy Town Football Club, said that they were worried that the playing area would be reduced. “We have requested the BBMP not to reduce the playing area. Secondly, a proper drain facility has to be built as the ground gets filled with water even after a mild shower when it rains,” he said, adding that they have also requested for proper floodlights.

The playground holds a special place for the community. “Many football and hockey clubs have events here. Over the years, it nurtured various football and hockey players who have represented the State at the national level,” said one resident.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/mwhhh8/article32754179.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGFOOTBALLP3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/murphy-town-corporation-ground-to-be-renovated/article32754180.ece
288,2020/10/03,"Chennai police tell pharmacies not to sell drugs to youth, children without prescriptions","This is part of the police’s efforts to prevent substance abuse among young people

The City Police have asked owners of pharmacies not to sell drugs and medicines to anyone who does not have the necessary prescription.

As part of its efforts to prevent substance abuse among minor children, the police held a meeting with pharmacy shop owners in Chennai on Friday, and advised them not to sell sedatives and narcotic drugs to minors.

Across the city, police personnel have been conducting frequent drives against drug cartels and rehabilitating juveniles, first offenders and the youth. The police have now joined hands with pharma retailers and medical shop owners to conduct a ‘Drive Against Drugs’.

Police sources said a two-month study has revealed that many youth and minors in the city are addicted to drugs available at medical shops. On the instructions of the Commissioner of Police, all police officers and personnel have taken steps to prevent young persons from using sedatives and narcotic drugs.

Police personnel of the Madhavaram district conducted an interactive meeting with medical shop owners on Friday. Several instructions were issued to the retailers to curtail the sale of sedatives and narcotics.

A senior police officer said, “Pharmacies operating within city limits were advised not to sell drugs and tablets to anyone without a doctor's prescription. Further, police station phone numbers should be displayed and pasted at all stores to be visible to the public, and they should immediately inform the police if any young people and children buy such drugs.”

Pharmacies should not sell sedative tablets, narcotics and cough syrups to minor children and youth without prescriptions. Frequent buyers of cough syrup and other narcotics should be taken note of by shop owners, and this information should be passed on to the police.

Illegal sellers of drugs and syrups to the youth will have to face legal consequences, the police have warned.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/8zu36h/article32758324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03OCTTH--DRUGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-police-tell-pharmacies-not-to-sell-drugs-to-youth-children-without-prescriptions/article32758325.ece

291,2020/10/03,Madipakkam North East residentscarry out a survey of stormwater drains,"They have asked Zone 14 officials to ensure some of the SWDs are desilted and a few others interconnected before the onset of the North-East Monsoon

Madipakkam North East Residents’ Welfare Association (MNERWA) has placed three requests with Zone 14 (Perungudi) of Greater Chennai Corporation. One, desilting existing stormwater drains (SWDs) made sluggish by dumping of garbage, before the onset of the North-East Monsoon.

Request number two can’t be brought to fruition before the monsoon, but nevertheless residents can’t keep from highlighting it. They report that many areas in Madipakkam lack stormwater drains, a factor adversely impacting the process of rainwater being carried from Madipakkam North East to the Pallikaranai Marsh through Kaiveli.

“Only Ram Nagar and Kuberan Nagar have stormwater drains. The rest of the localities, which include Madipakkam Enfield Avenue, Anna Nagar, Karpagambal Nagar, Lakshmi Nagar, Thanthai Periyar Nagar, Ramamurthy Nagar, Vishal Nagar, Krishna Nagar and Arul Murugan Nagar don’t,” says M. Anbalagan, president, MNERWA.

The third request has to do with the home stretch, about taking the SWDs to all the homes, and thereby making the SWD network complete. Now. the network is patchy, lacking interconnectedness.

“In Rajaji Nagar and Sadasiva Nagar, only some streets have SWDs, which means there is still waterlogging in these neighbourhoods,” says Anbalagan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/enb15w/article32758271.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06DCadyrMNERWA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/madipakkam-north-east-residents-carry-out-a-survey-of-stormwater-drains/article32758272.ece
292,2020/10/03,A peek into the workings of a group formed to help seniors,"Through Google Groups, the volunteers stay connected with the elders and address their everyday concerns

Kalakshetra Colony Welfare Association has constituted a team of dedicated volunteers who would attend to the everyday concerns of senior citizens, during the pandemic. And Association would fight the seniors’ battle. There has been sufficient evidence of both.

Through Google Groups, the volunteers stay connected to beneficiary-seniors. The seniors can easily contact the 15 volunteers, which include Archana Hari, Krishna Mohan, Krithika Vishwanathan, Vaishnavi Acharya, Akshar Jaikumar, and Ankit Mohota, as the latter’s addresses, phone numbers and email IDs are shared on Google Groups. The seniors can contact the volunteers any time of the day, says Association general secretary Shanthi Krishnan who heads the group.

These volunteers have been helping senior-citizens and super-senior citizens get essential provisions, medicines and vegetables. They spend out of their pocket to buy what the seniors need, and the seniors would repay them when the bills are presented.

Whenever a senior needs certain work to be carried out with a government agency, this group does the coordination work.

“I coordinate with Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC). We have been receiving excellent support from the GCC. Deenadayalan, assistant engineer, Ward 181, and sanitary inspector Naveen, are particularly in regular touch with us, rendering all the required help. Many a time, with the help and support of GCC, we have guided senior-citizens, maids and security guards to nearby COVID-19 testing centres,” says Shanthi Krishnan.

When the functions of a bank located on the premises of Kalakshetra Colony were going to be merged with those of two other branch banks — the savings account going to a branch located at Besant Nagar, and locker facility to a branch located East Coast Road — the Association took up the issue. This bank at Kalakshetra Colony was a boon to senior citizens. As many seniors were operating their accounts there, they would have to travel to the branches to draw cash, bring jewels from the locker and for other bank-related works.

“Upon hearing the proposed move, we took up the issue with the authorities concerned at the higher-level, and stalled it. At present, we are helping the bank staff identify a new premises for the branch, inside the colony,” points out Krishnan.

“Ever since it was formed, KCWA has kept helping seniors citizens and super senior-citizens as one of its main objectives.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jcxtw8/article32758230.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04dcadyrKalakshetra-Colony-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-peek-into-the-workings-of-a-group-formed-to-help-seniors/article32758231.ece
293,2020/10/03,"Lift traffic curbs on service lane below Thirumangalam flyover, say motorists","The recently introduced one-way traffic arrangement is causing congestion in the interior streets

A section of residents in Anna Nagar have sought that the service lane below the Thirumangalam flyover be re-opened. Nearly a month ago, two-way movement of vehicles on this service lane of Jawaharlal Nehru Road (J.N) Main Road was temporarily discontinued to facilitate Metrowater’s water pipeline work.

The existing one-way traffic arrangement on the service lane is resulting in congestion of interior roads and lanes, where vehicular flow seems continual.

The interior roads most affected on account of unregulated traffic include 13th, 14th, 15th Main Road, Sixth Avenue Road and Fourth Avenue Road. These roads connect the residential sections of the locality with the Anna Nagar roundtana via Second Avenue Main Road.

As part of the pipeline-laying work, existing decades-old pipelines are being replaced with new pipelines that can carry more volume of water to the neighbourhood including its tail-end areas. The new pipelines are being laid along the footpath on the service lane towards Koyambedu from Thirumangalam for a distance of around 350 metres.

“Traffic violations on these narrow lanes, especially those involving motorcyclists driving on the wrong side, are putting pedestrians at risk of accidents. Continual movement of vehicles including MTC buses also restricts residents from going from one street to another for their shopping needs,” says K. Vasanthi, a resident of Anna Nagar.

In the past, residents of Anna Nagar East had put up with the work undertaken for Metro Rail stations. Movement of vehicles had to be restricted. After almost two years, the new stations opened and streets were relaid with LED street lights, footpaths, reflectors and speed breakers mainly at intersections.

Many road users compare the existing one-way traffic arrangement to what prevailed during the days when Metro Rail work was under way.

The new traffic arrangement

Motorists have to take left turn at the Thirumangalam junction on Second Avenue Main Road to reach the narrow 13th Main Road and Shanthi Colony to head to Koyambedu on P.H Road. Likewise, a portion of Fourth Avenue Main Road has also been made a one-way with motorist taking the stretch having to use Second Avenue Main Road to reach the Thirumangalam junction.

The new traffic arrangement entails a detour of around two kilometres for motorists. Motorists and residents have blamed the local traffic police for not alerting them about the traffic changes. With MTC buses being operated from September, the Thirumangalam junction and interior streets along Second Avenue Main Road in Anna Nagar are witness to traffic chaos during rush hour. “Steps will be taken to restore normal traffic arrangement in the neighbourhood soon,” police sources said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/b3sxlp/article32758089.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04DCTRAFFICTHIRUMANGALAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lift-traffic-curbs-on-service-lane-below-thirumangalam-flyover-say-motorists/article32758090.ece
294,2020/10/03,A stitch in time saves nine,"Eighty-one-year-old S. Gangabhai pursues tailoring as a hobby. During the pandemic, she upskilled herself to stitch three-layered masks

Hobbies keep 81-year-old S. Gangabhai occupied as her routine visits to the neighborhood temple have reduced. She often turns to painting and tailoring to beat the lockdown blues. There is now a social element to her pursuit of tailoring as a hobby.

She has stitched and distributed three-layered cloth masks to relatives, friends and conservancy workers for free. Earlier, she would use her tailoring skills primarily for stitching herself blouses.

At Annai Indira Nagar in Velachery, where she lives, she is known as “Kovil Pati”, as she frequents this temple, not a day passing without a visit in the morning and another in the evening.

She helps out in the temple.

Due to the pandemic, this routine has taken a beating.

Being a senior-citizen, she had been confining herself to the safety of her home. Only since September 1, when lockdown restrictions were significantly relaxed, has she been visiting the temple. Considering her safety, her family ensures these visits are not frequent. Nor is she allowed to spend as much time at the temple as before.

Passion for painting

Her son S. Kumararaja, a civic activist, says, “Now she spends much of her time drawing, painting and stitching. Even at this age she does Tanjore painting and glass painting. She learnt the art of drawing from her father who was a drawing master in a school and a freedom fighter. While doing embroidery, she can thread the needle without wearing spectacles.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/q4y3wf/article32758079.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04dcadyr-S-Gangabhai-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-stitch-in-time-saves-nine/article32758082.ece

“Although power cables get severed and fall, thankfully no untoward incidents have occurred. We want the authorities concerned to ensure tree branches are trimmed at the earliest,” says Kumaresan, an office-bearer of the association.

As the north-east monsoon is approaching, the Association has taken up this issue with Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (Tangedco) and Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC).

“We have had to make a representation to both the departments, because Tangedco says it is the GCC’s job; and GCC fixes the responsibility with Tangedco. However, we find that both the departments carry out the work. Only a few trees have been subjected to a trimming exercise. There are many more that ought to be trimmed. Our Association also carries out this work with Corporation’s consent,” says Kumaresan.

A similar exercise has to be carried out in the neighboring areas of AGS Colony Phase Three, which include Guruswamy Nagar, Annai Velankani Nagar Phase Two, and Selva Lakshmi Garden.

The Association complains trimming exercise is often not carried out right — there is not just trimming, but ruthless cutting of the branches.

“We have take pains to create a green cover in our locality by planting tree saplings and tending to them, and it is disappointing to find branches being chaopped off more what is necessary,” says Kumaresan.

Besides, the Association has requested Tangedco to provide an underground power cable facility at the earliest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/66sang/article32758034.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26dcadyr-AGS-Colony-RWA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/power-cables-keep-falling-often-say-mugaliwakkam-residents/article32758036.ece
296,2020/10/03,Fire station in Ashok Nagar gains in size and significance,"Expected to be completed in January 2021, the new facility will serve as the headquarters of the Chennai South Division of Tamil Nadu Fire & Rescue Services

A small room on Anna Main Road in Ashok Nagar that has been serving as a Tamil Nadu Fire & Rescue Services (TNFRS) station since 1979, is giving way to a multi-storey building. The new TNFRS station building, expected to be ready by January 2021, is of considerbaly larger dimesnions. But its significance derives from more than just its imposing size and facilities. The new building will serve as the headquarters of the Chennai South Division of the Department.

Of the four divisions — North, South, Central and Suburban — Chennai South has the most number of fire stations. There are nine of them, including stations in Mylapore, Raj Bhavan, Thiruvanmiyur, T. Nagar, Saidapet and Tambaram.

The Public Works Department (PWD) began the construction of this facility in May 2018 when the State government gave its nod for the project.

“It is almost ready except for a few works including flooring, plastering and painting. The station will coordinate with other fire stations especially those south of the city on rescue work,” says a TNFRS official.

As per the plan, the new building will have a host of facilities including separate cabins for station officers, firemen, a resting room for firemen and a conference hall.

The one-room structure that is being replaced is dilapidated, and has always offered only a bare minimum of amenities.

More importantly, the new facility will also have separate offices for the District Fire Officer (DFO - South), the Assistant Director (AD) and other senior officers of the Department.

Officials in the department said that among other features a specialised section known as Wings Department will be accommodated in the new building. The role of the Wings Department largely has to do with creating awareness campaigns about fire safety and rescue operations.

These campaigns are carried out in schools, colleges and public places by this department on a regular basis. Further, the Ashok Nagar Fire station office will get a skylift that can extend up to a height of 54 metres. At present, such skylifts are available only in select fire stations including the ones in Teynampet, Guindy, Tambaram, Raj Bhavan,Thiruvanmiyur and Egmore within the city limits.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yngcl2/article32758006.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10dctngr-TNFRS-Station-Ashok-Nagar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fire-station-in-ashok-nagar-gains-in-size-and-significance/article32758007.ece
297,2020/10/03,Mambalam residents seek relocation of PDS outlets,"While queueing up in front of these facilities, cardholders find themselves standing on the road and in the line of moving vehicles

Residents of neighbourhoods along Rangarajapuram Main Road in West Mambalam want the three PDS outlets functioning under the flyover shifted out. They point out that their safety is compromised as they wait on the busy main road. Built at a cost of around ₹3 lakh each, the three ration shops together cater to over 6,000 cardholders in a large cluster of neighbourhoods, which include Subramaniyapuram, Parangusapuram, Viswanathapuram, Ramakrishnapuram and Dharmapuram in West Mambalam since February 2019.

Residents seek the relocation of these facilities because Rangarajapuram Main Road is narrow and witnesses continual traffic movement. The other factor contributing to this demand is that the ‘Y’ shaped Rangarajapuram flyover — where one ramp connects Bazullah Road with Kodambakkam railway station through Rangarajapuram Main Road and the other ramp connects Bazullah Road with Subramania Nagar in Kodambakkam — also witnesses heavy traffic.

Motorists on the way to the Kodambakkam railway station from Bazullah Road have to proceed towards Subramaniya Nagar and then take a ‘U’ turn to reach the railway station. Further, for residents from a good number of localities, Rangarajapuram Main Road provides the option of reaching T. Nagar and Pondy Bazaar without having to take the congested Arcot Road and North Usman Road. In fact, the road connects two railway stations (of course, now closed due to lockdown restrictions) Nungambakkam and Kodambakkam with T. Nagar via Duraiswamy subway.

Ever since the PDS outlets came up under the flyover last year, cardholders could be found waiting on the narrow road hindering movement of vehicular traffic.

With relaxation of lockdown restrictions, the road is once again witnessing continual traffic movement, at least during rush hour.

“While queueing up in front of these PDS outlets, we are at high risk for accidents due to speeding vehicles, especially two-wheelers,” says S. Ramachandran, a resident of West Mambalam.

Senior citizens prefer to wait in the interior streets opposite the ration shops and when their turn comes, a staff member at the outlet calls them and hands over the groceries. Things get a lot more complicated when it rains. Residents believe a permanent building in West Mambalam would put an end to this problem.

An official at the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Society says, “Taking the safety issue into account, appropriate steps will be taken.”

The 962-metre-long Rangarajapuram flyover was constructed by the Chennai Corporation and the Southern Railway at a cost of Rs 23.76 crore in October 2012. The Southern Railway built the two bowstring bridges that connect the two ramps, which were built by the Chennai Corporation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tdzcpd/article32757978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04dctngr-Rangarajapuram-Flyover-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mambalam-residents-seek-relocation-of-pds-outlets/article32757980.ece

299,2020/10/03,COVID-19: An octogenarian’s diary,"S.P. Ramachandran says it was not the Coronavirus, but the canker of loneliness that he dreaded the most

S.P. Ramachandran did not quite relish the thought that he would have to continue staying all alone in a room except when medical personnel and support staff would attend to him. What COVID-19 could do to him did not grip him as intensely as the fear of loneliness.

“Having been placed in a separate room with no one to see and talk to, I was frustrated. The hospital took utmost care of me, making my stay extremely comfortable, but the thought of having to spend the days without anyone's company was disturbing,” says Ramachandran, who is 86 years old.

Knowing how much he loved to be around people, friends and relatives knew exactly how hard it was for him. At his apartment complex in Vadapalani, Ramachandran is known as ‘photo maama’ for his passion for photography, and also his efficiency in it.

Thanks to this skill and his amiable nature, he would invariably get invited to a birthday party any neighbour at the complex would be organising for their child.

Ramachandran was famous for striking up a conversation with strangers. After every evening walk in the neighbourhood, his circle of acquaintances would get wider.

“Tatha loves to socialise and he would engage even with random persons,” says his grandson Rohith Kannan, a house surgeon.

From the word go, it was obvious Ramachandran would not be able to adjust to a private-room arrangement.

“In my frustration, I told a nurse ‘I think I will die’ and what I had said had been discussed. As the oldest among the COVID-19 patients undergoing treatment at the hospital, there was already enough attention coming my way. Now, there was more attention. The next day the doctor who came to check on me opened the topic. The doctor chuckled and asked me my birth star and declared that I would live for 100 years,” Ramachandran laughs recalling how the doctor tried to cheer him up.

Within the next couple of hours, Ramachandran was shifted to a three-sharing room.

“My oxygen level that was fluctuating had stabilised by then,” says Ramachandran.

The fact that one of the two was his grandson's classmate, Reshma, brought a cheer in him.

For the next five days that Reshma's stay at the hospital lasted, Ramachandran found somebody with a patient ear. Two days after Reshma was discharged, Ramachandran also left the hospital, having recovered from COVID-19.

“But I was asked to be in home quarantine, and so I locked myself up in my room. This time, I did it voluntarily to avoid the risk of my wife and grandson getting infected,” he says.

Of course, he still found company, this time in books and classical music. The octogenarian says he has returned to following his usual routine, but with greater cautiousness.

Every morning, he walks inside the house for at least 30 minutes. Wearing a mask and a pair of gloves, he walks within the apartment compound in the evening for at least an hour.

Ramachandran says, “My apartment complex has no lift, so I have always been used to climbing the 72 stairs multiple times. I think all this keeps me fit and healthy, along with my will power, has helped me fight the virus.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/16azn4/article32757939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04dcadyr-Senior-Citizen,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-an-octogenarians-diary/article32757940.ece
300,2020/10/03,‘Check rash driving on widened service lanes of Kodambakkam flyover’,"With many old measures having failed to yield results, Greater Chennai Corporation is planning a new strategy

In July this year, Zone 10 of Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) widened the service lanes of the Kodambakkam flyover to ease traffic movement. While widening the service lanes was indeed commendable, the exercise would have been complete if there had been in-built checks against rash driving and traffic violations.

GCC now plans to put safety measures in place.

It may be noted that a fatal accident occurred near the flyover a fortnight ago: A motorcyclist got killed when he drove on the wrong side of the widened lane. Residents point out that accidents happen with disturbing frequency on these service lanes since the COVID -19 lockdown restrictions were eased in September.

“In addition to the lanes being widened, concrete slabs have been placed for a distance of 20 feet along the ramp of the flyover to prevent motorists coming from the interior streets, from entering the flyover. However, this feature has not brought about the desired change. Motorists find ways to drive on the wrong side of the road. Hence, a median on the ramp of the flyover will be constructed to check wrong-way driving,” says a Corporation official.

Earlier, to check such violations, the traffic police installed CCTV cameras on the ramp of the flyover. Besides, steel barricades were placed from the ramp of the flyover towards the main road to prevent wrong-way driving. However, motorists drive a little further beyond the barricades and take a left turn to access the streets on both sides of the flyover.

Residents suggest that an adequate number of traffic police personnel have to be deployed near the flyover. At present, they are posted near Meenakshi College for Women, around 100 metres from the flyover. Motorists therefore find it easy to violate road safety rules.

The Kodambakkam flyover is busy for the following reasons: a railway station and a college are located nearby; it is part of a busy route for MTC buses; and it connects Nungambakkam and Anna Salai.

One-way traffic is maintained on the flyover’s service lanes. In Kodambakkam, the traffic arrangement being followed for many years is that motorists on Arcot Road heading towards Kodambakkam can use the service lane to reach Poonamallee High Main Road at Kilpauk via streets below the flyover and the Nelson Manickam Road junction.

On the other hand, motorists from residential localities below the flyover can use the other service lane towards Vadapalani via Arcot Road.

This traffic arrangement is aimed at easing traffic flow on the main road and preventing accidents on the service lanes.

However, many motorists from interior lanes below the flyover drive in the wrong direction to reach the carriageway of the flyover. Further, motorists on the flyover heading towards Vadapalani also jump lanes on the flyover to reach the service lane. All of these result in traffic chaos and accidents.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dlrl4a/article32757930.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04dctngr-Kodambakkam-Flyover-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/check-rash-driving-on-widened-service-lanes-of-kodambakkam-flyover/article32757932.ece
301,2020/10/03,Life looks up for these senior citizens after encounter with COVID-19,"Eighty one-year-old V. Parvathy is having a busy Monday, but she complains of unfinished work.

“I usually complete writing a page of the narayaneeyanam by late evening, but today I have managed only half of what I would have achieved by this hour,” says the retired librarian.

If she was upset that the telephonic interview was eating further into her routine, she would not show it.

“Today I had so many calls enquiring about my health and also my fellow residents,” says Parvathy aachi as she is known by those close to her.

Parvathy aachi is one of 29 residents of Anandam, a free home for senior citizens, who were in the news recently for how they beat COVID-19, having recovered from it after treatment at the Government Stanley Medical College and Hospital. What is remarkable is that 25 of them are aged above 70 and have multiple comorbidities.

At present, these 29 residents are isolating themselves, staying at a student hostel a short jog from Anandam in Ambattur. Anandam has 105 residents.

Parvathy aachi recites a list of activities she has been a part of, and they include kanji preparation for the group and helping wash clothes.

Those asked if the COVID-19 diagnosis and the subsequent hospitalisation caused them anxiety answer in the negative.

“There is nothing to worry about; be positive. We have seen many things in life and this phase will also pass. Keep yourself occupied doing things you like,” says N.Saraswathi, who is 76 years.

She is in-charge of planning and coordinating the kitchen activities, including choosing the menu. Away from the home now, she is missing this role. At the student hostel they are staying at, they can’t do any major cooking.

At Anandam, residents are encouraged to take care of the home, assisting in a variety of chores, including cooking, managing the kitchen garden and cleaning. “We have four to five people above 90 years with us and those of us who are healthier than others, take care of these residents. We avoid discussing the latest news, and instead choose to talk about the good old times,” says Parvathy.

Ram P. Mony, manager (admin), says, “Earlier, not all of them would take the instructions seriously, now they do. They would not tell me if they are having body pain, now they have understood the importance of timely intervention. The fussy eaters have also changed, post-hospitalisation, as they know they have to eat healthy.”

Between managing the activities at the Home, Ram would sometimes forgets to take his kashayam.

“Now they are behind me, ensuring I take it,” he says.

Every one-and-a-half hours, residents prepare some health drink — buttermilk, lemon juice and kabasuru kudineer.

“We persuade those who don’t particularly like to take these health drinks to do so,” says Parvathy. She says evening coffee has been replaced with sukku malli coffee. There is also greater interest in acupressure.

Bhageerathy Ramamoorthy, managing trustee of Andanam, says the seniors have been able to come out of the crisis because of the healthy habits they have been following, and healthy food habits among them.

“Now, we have employed a nurse to check on them regularly. Thrice a day I call them, plus they have the doctor calling them. It’s a big joint family and this continues at the new place we have rented for a month,” she says.

These seniors point out that they have always taken the necessary precautions, but now they wouldn’t mind erring on the side of caution.

Masks are a must even when one is sitting in the room and talking to a person in the next bed.

302,2020/10/03,Taking a spiritual route to solve a civic problem,"Here is Madhavan Raju’s morning ritual.

He carries a small plastic chair and parks himself in it, right outside the grill gate of his house at 7th Street in Murugan Nagar, Kolathur. Whenever he watches someone approaching a small strip of a footpath, garbage bag in hand, he would politely talk them out of dumping the trash on the footpath. Usually, people would arrive in a two-wheeler to dump the garbage on this spot, next to compound wall of a vacant piece of land.

The intense lockdown gave Raju a break from this routine.

Intense lockdown gave the much-needed break for Raju’s morning routine which he was doing for the past few years.

Movement of vehciles having increased since August, due to relaxation of lockdown restrictions, Raju has had to restart the routine.

“This routine is cumbersome, and so, my neighbours, my family friend and I came up with the idea of decorating the wall with pictures of deities,” says Raju, a small-time businessman.

They decided on this strategy following a brainstorming session where the idea of raising a steel fence around the the the small strip of a footpath, and having garbage bins on the footpath were rejected. It may be noted that street-corner garbage bins were removed more than a year ago to encourage source segregation of bio-degradeable and non-biodegradable waste by residents. Before implementing this idea, these residents sought Corporation officials’ permission to do so. Warning signboards against garbage dumping were also put up.

“Being a residents’ initiative, we fully supported the idea of keeping their public place clean. Such an effort by residents also creates awareness against misuse of public space,” says Senthil, Assistant Engineer (A.E), Ward 64 (Zone-6, Madhavaram) of the Greater Chennai Corporation.

Surrounded residential localities like V.V. Nagar, Kumaran Nagar and Poompuhar Nagar, Mugugan Nagar seven streets with more than 500 families. Door-to-door garbage collection is being carried out every day by conservancy workers, covering all households.

With lockdown restrictions being eased, the neighbourhood witnesses greater movement of people and vehicles. Office goers find it convenient to dump the garbage on the roadside than wait for the conservancy staff to collect it from their households.

Residents of Seventh Street point out that an empty private land makes it a convenient excuse for motorcyclists to dump garbage in front of the plot on the footpath.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/h0hv0a/article32757847.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04dckolathur2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/taking-a-spiritual-route-to-solve-a-civic-problem/article32757848.ece
303,2020/10/03,"Auto driver calls Corporation, and workers arrive to fix deadly patch","Following an accident involving a protruding manhole near Chintamani junction, B. Shankar makes sure that the problem is set right immediately

Recently, while waiting at an auto stand near Chintamani junction on Kilpauk Garden Road in Anna Nagar, autorickshaw driver B. Shankar witnessed an accident. A motorcyclist along with a pillion rider had a fall with their skidding on impact with a protruding manhole. Along with a few pedestrians, Shankar rescued the two.

Shankar would not leave the spot, but alert the civic officials of Zone 8 of the Chennai Corporation about the accident, more particularly what caused it. He did this with the help of a traffic constable at the junction. He had a strong reason to do this, as this was the fourth such accident he had witnessed at the spot since September when lockdown restrictions were significantly eased.

“Sometimes, you have to go beyond just helping people. As I wait for customers near the junction, I often see such accidents and help the victims. But, on that day, I knew I had to something more than, so that an issue gets resolved,” explains 42-year-old Shankar.

In half an hour’s time, a team of three civic workers from the Bus Road Route (BRR) Department of Greater Chennai Corporation reached the spot. They dug the carriageway around the manhole, up to one feet, and ensured that the manhole was brought on par with the road. The damaged manhole was plastered with the uneven carriageway around the manhole and was bitumen-topped, as a temporary measure. A day later, the team visited the spot again to assess the condition of the repaired portion. They found out that the patched-up portion had sunk due to continuous movement of vehicles. And therefore, they used 25 kilograms of cold concrete mixer to level a much larger space around the manhole.

Corporation officials have pointed out that the damaged manhole is a utility manhole that had been created mainly for provision of Internet cables and other services by other services providers a few years ago. As per norms, such utility manholes should be constructed around one feet from the existing footpath to allow space for other public works like water lines. As the utility manhole is located close to the inlets of the existing stormwater drain, bitumen around the manhole got eroded. The erosion of bitumen went unnoticed due to low volume of traffic during the intense lockdown.

“Regular monitoring of the condition of key bitumen stretches are being carried out in the neighbourhood,” says a Corporation official.

Many motorists use the Chintamani junction, which connects New Avadi Road and the First Avenue Road in Anna Nagar with Kilpauk Garden Road. Chintamani junction has become a busy section, especially after channel-laying work began on Third Avenue Road three years ago. Motorists from ICF, Ayanavaram, Villivakkam, Padi, Anna Nagar, Shenoy Nagar and Kolathur take the Chintamani junction accessing it via New Avadi Road as the junction part of a short route to PH Road at Kilpauk.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lp3e8n/article32757738.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04dcman1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/auto-driver-calls-corporation-and-workers-arrive-to-fix-deadly-patch/article32757743.ece
304,2020/10/03,New rules for Aminjikarai market,"Shops are allowed to open in a staggered format to keep traders and shoppers safe

Sitting behind small heaps of fish at his thatched shop, 56-year-old V. Parthiban hardly evokes a sense of cheer. One could instead sense that behind the mask, boredom is written large on his face. Flies do sorties around the fish, and Parthiban does not try to wave them away. Occasionally, his eyes flit to a closed fish shop opposite his. This is a scene from the common market in Aminjikarai.

That fish shop belongs to S. Arumugam, Parthiban’s friend from childhood. After school hours, they would hang out together at the market, as both hail from families that have been doing the fish trade, which got passed on to them. Each would help out at his respective family’s outlet. During weekends, they would head to the wholesale fish market in Kasimedu to source fish for the retail outlets in Aminjikarai market.

Since then, little has changed. They are residents of the same street. They buy fish together from the wholesale market in North Chennai and divide the purchase before placing it in cold storage.

Now, till further notice comes from the Greater Chennai Corporation, both would be conducting their business on different days.

A week ago, civic officials of Ward 102 of Zone-8 (Anna Nagar) of the Greater Chennai Corporation introduced a set of guidelines, which included allowing the shops to open only on alternate days as part of preventive steps against COVID-19.

All the shops located diagonally opposite each other can open on the same day. By this arrangement, it has been ensured that a distance of 20 feet separate two open shops. Civic officials marked all shops including those on the streets outside the common market in Aminjikarai with odd and even numbers.

“I know most of the traders in the fish market since my childhood and we are used to working together. What to do we have to adjust to the new norms laid down by the civic body to prevent the spread of infection,” says fish trader Parthiban, a father of two.

Sanitation measures

The fish market in Aminjikarai has more than 100 outlets, a majority of them run families with three generations of fish traders. An equal number of vegetable traders have their shops on the streets around the market. Spread over 15,000 sq.ft, the market has a narrow pathway, around three feet wide, for consumers to walk inside the facility. Every day, the market has to be disinfected by traders before resuming work and also after shutting shop for the day.

Visitors and traders are allowed to enter the market after thermal screening.

They have to be wearing face masks. A hand sanitiser is kept at the entrance. All traders are tested by the health officials of the civic body once in a fortnight.

“We also told the local traders that it is their responsibility to ensure all visitors wear face masks. If some visitors have forgotten it, the traders should provide free face masks to them and then allow them,” says S. Kalaiarasan, Assistant Engineer (A.E), Ward 102, Zone - 8.

Earlier, all traders in the market and also on the streets in the neighbourhood were relocated to the playground near the Shenoy Nagar Metro Rail station to ensure social distancing. With lockdown restrictions being eased, civic officials have decided to relocate the traders to their original places at the market.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/azn6ww/article32757719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04DCAMINJIKARAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/new-rules-for-aminjikarai-market/article32757720.ece

“We are trying to put this facility in place in parking lots as soon as possible. Perhaps, it will be implemented within six months. It will be very convenient for passengers to just scan the code and leave without hassle,” an official said.

Smart card problems

Sources said passengers who park their vehicles had to separately buy a smart card now to pay.

“Sometimes, in a few stations, the staff do not have pre-issued smart cards in the parking lot. So, if a passenger used a QR code ticket for travel, he has to leave the vehicle, walk all the way till the concourse and return to the parking lot to pay. This should be resolved soon,” another official said.

While the number of takers for QR code ticketing is picking up, there are still issues that CMRL grapples with as far as the system is concerned, including gate scanners not registering them properly and leaving commuters stuck behind the barricade.

Officials said they were working to resolve the issues at the earliest.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/qr-code-billing-will-be-implemented-in-chennai-metro-station-parking-lots-soon/article32755865.ece

City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal on Friday said history-sheeters were under constant surveillance.

When journalists asked him about the steps taken by the police to handle anti-social elements, he said the police had always had a category-wise list of history-sheeters, including details of the ones active within and outside the city.

“We are always watching them and will take immediate action if they commit any offence,” Mr. Aggarwal said.

The Commissioner added that as per the Madras High Court’s suggestion, a draft legislation on curtailing rowdyism was on the cards. [The DGP had informed the court about the same on Thursday.]

Mr. Aggarwal, along with Additional Commissioners of Police, flagged off an awareness campaign vehicle on COVID-19 prevention and precautionary measures.

Public cooperation

He said the State government had been taking all out efforts to prevent the spread of the disease and had been successful in controlling its spread. He added that 100% success could be achieved with the full participation of the public.

The Commissioner said over 2,500 police personnel had been infected so far. While most of them had been cured and had rejoined duty, around 250 were still hospitalised or under home quarantine.

Southern Railway will operate workmen special suburban trains from October 5, following the State government’s requests.

A limited number of trains will be operated by the Chennai division on all routes, including Chennai Central-Avadi/Thiruvallur/Arakkonam, Chennai Beach-Chengalpattu/Tambaram and Chennai Beach-Velachery.

In a release on Friday, Southern Railway said only staff members of essential services, authorised by the government, would be allowed to travel in these trains. These workers would have to produce travel permission letters issued by the government’s nodal officer. The letters would have details such as the name, designation, department/office of the employees, and the names of the originating and destination stations.

The commuters will be issued daily tickets/season tickets only on production of the letters in original, along with the photo identity cards issued by the government departments.

To prevent unauthorised persons from entering these trains, the Southern Railway has put in place two layers of checks. Railway Protection Force/Government Railway Police personnel will check the identity proof at the entry points and ticket checking staff members will check train/season tickets and the identity proof near the platforms.

The Southern Railway will take several measures to prevent COVID-19, including sanitising the rakes and thermal-screening the passengers. Commuters must wear face masks and maintain physical distancing while travelling on the trains and waiting at stations.

312,2020/10/03,"Flagging cess non-transfer, its economic impact","The C&AG’s observations in its financial audit report relate to the denial of States’ share in the divisible taxes pool

The Financial Audit Report of the Government of India by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) for 2018-19 placed in Parliament on September 23 has raised significant issues of a lack of transparency and propriety. The Opposition-ruled States have criticised the Centre on the short transfer of Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation cess revenues to the GST Compensation Fund.

The C&AG’s report stated that the Government of India did not transfer ₹6,466 crore of compensation cess revenue in 2017-18 and ₹40,806 crore in 2018-19. Thus, a total of ₹47,272 crore was retained in the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI). The report also alluded to the non-apportionment of a portion of Integrated Goods and Service Tax (IGST) among the States and retaining it in the CFI.

Editorial | Cess pool: On CAG report of Centre's accounts

Boosts claim by States

At a time when there is a raging controversy over the Union government’s refusal to compensate States for the shortfall in the collection of GST as per the agreement, and, instead, giving States two options to borrow, the C&AG’s report has only added more fuel to the fire of the States’ claim. These States contend that when there were surplus collections, the Union government appropriated them and when there is a shortfall, it simply distances itself, instead asking States to borrow.

Levy of cesses

The C&AG’s observations on a non-transfer of cesses, however, has a much larger macroeconomic significance. There are as many as 35 cesses levied by the government of India. These are earmarked taxes and the proceeds should be used for the purposes for which they are levied. A number of reserve funds or development boards have been created for these specified purposes and the collections from the cesses are supposed to be transferred to these funds placed in public accounts for defraying expenditures on the specified purposes. They are not a part of the CFI and cannot be used for defraying regular expenses. The transactions in public accounts are supposed to be done by the government as a trustee or a banker, and are not subject to vote by Parliament.

The C&AG has pointed out that in 2018-19, the collections from 35 Cesses amounted to nearly ₹2.75-lakh crore of which only ₹1.64-lakh crore was transferred to various reserve funds and boards designated for the purpose in Public Accounts. Thus, the short transfer to the Public Account during the year amounted to ₹1.11-lakh crore payment.

Besides, ₹47,272 crore short transfers to the GST Compensation Cess Fund, there was a short payment of ₹38,000 crore in the transfer of the road cess to the Central Road and Infrastructure Fund. In addition, the government collected ₹1,24,399 crore from the cess on crude oil which, as required, was not transferred to the Oil Industry Development Board (the designated Reserve Fund) and retained in the CFI. By short transfer of the realised amount of cess to the respective funds and boards in Public Account, the government understated revenue and fiscal deficits for the year; and it works out to more than 1.2% of GDP.

Thus, in addition to off Budget borrowings to cover fertilizer and food subsidy, financing irrigation projects from the Long Term Irrigation Fund (LTIF) created by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), and financing of railway projects through borrowings from the Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC), short transfer of cess revenue to public accounts is a method used to obfuscate the Budget to show lower revenue and fiscal deficits.

The Hindu Explains | Where are the funds collected through cess parked?

Process becomes opaque

Should the government of India raise revenues through so many cesses? Cesses are earmarked taxes and to ensure a minimum allocation to important and priority programmes, this method of financing could be used. In India, even after a number of cesses and surcharges were abolished when the GST was implemented, there are as many as 35 cesses levied by the Finance and other Ministries of the Government of India. The ostensible reasoning for levying these cesses is the belief that ring fencing of revenue for specified priority purposes may evoke greater tax compliance as people can link the benefits with the taxes paid.

However, when there are as many as 35 earmarked cesses, it is difficult to see all of them as priority areas requiring protection of funding. There is also a possibility of limiting the funding of important and priority areas to the amount of cess collected even when they require much larger amounts. Too many cesses also complicate the tax system and add to administrative and compliance costs. In addition, the operation of the cesses involving collections and transfer to designated funds in the Public Accounts makes the entire process opaque as the operation of these funds too needs to be monitored and audited.

Governmental arrangements

A major reason for the proliferation of cesses in India is to be found in the inter-governmental fiscal arrangements. Article 270 of the Constitution requires the Union government to distribute the proceeds from all Central taxes listed in the Union List based on the recommendation of the Finance Commission. However, Article 271 excludes the distribution of the revenue from any surcharge or cess levied by the Union government for any specified purpose.

As the Finance Commissions are appointed once in five years, the Union government can raise additional revenue from taxes mainly through the levy of cesses and surcharges to avoid sharing them with the States. This has been practised for long and despite the adverse comments of many Finance Commissions, the Union government has found the practice convenient.

This is one of the ways to partially negate the recommendation of the Finance Commission, particularly when the Centre sees the recommendations as generous to the States. After the Fourteenth Finance Commission recommended that the share of the States in the divisible pool be pegged at 42%, almost all discretionary increases in taxes were done by levying cesses and surcharges. The large increases in additional excise duties on petroleum products this year will entirely accrue to the Centre. The States’ share in the gross Central taxes was 35% in 2015-16, the first year of the Fourteenth Finance Commission’s recommendation, but decreased to 32% in 2019-20, and in the current year, it could be less than 30% as a large volume of revenue from petroleum products is sought to be raised through additional excise duties.

As shown by Y.V. Reddy and G.R. Reddy (in their book, Indian Fiscal Federalism, p.241), the cesses and surcharges constituted just about 3% of Central gross tax revenue in 2000-01; but in 2015-16, it was 16.5%. It could be as much as 20% in 2020-21.

The issues raised by the C&AG relate merely to short transfer of funds, but the implications are much larger. They relate to obfuscations in the Budget and denying the share of the States in the divisible pool of taxes.

313,2020/10/03,"Letters to the Editor — October 3, 2020","Almost forgotten

May 27, 1964 is a day that sent shivers through every Indian then, desperate to imagine the future course of the nation; it was the day India’s first Prime Minister and a towering personality, Jawaharlal Nehru, breathed his last. It was, in short, a Himalayan task to fill the void created. Lal Bahadur Shastri happily dispelled the misgivings of every cynic and proved a strong man, with his qualities of firm conviction, honesty, simplicity and sincerity (Editorial page, “The Prime Minister India almost forgot”, October 2). Steering the country through difficult times — internally, on the food front, and externally, in a war with Pakistan — he emerged as the nation’s little strong man. Agriculture was given its due and the farming community had new vigour and life. Unfortunately, his sudden passing in Tashkent remains a mystery.

Seshagiri Row Karry,

India’s second Prime Minister shone on the basis of his simplicity, integrity, patriotism and intelligence. It is unfortunate that though he shares his birth date with Mahatma Gandhi, October 2, there is no mention of him on what is a gazetted holiday. Shastri was a leader who cared for the country and humanity; it is sad that those who work selflessly for society are rarely remembered.

A.L. Agarwal,

The article reminded me of another personality long forgotten. Recently, the Defence Minister while in Russia to attend the 75th Anniversary Victory Parade among other official meetings, mentioned the services of Dr. Dwarkanath Shantaram Kotnis to the Chinese during World War II. I would have been happier had he also mentioned the services of a scientist of Indian origin (who became a citizen of Soviet Union), Dr. Kolachala Seetha Ramayya, to the Soviet Union. A luminary in the field of tribiology (it was also called chemotology, or the chemistry of motors), he was educated in the U.S., at Chicago and Cornell. In the 1930s, responding to a call by the then USSR to build its petrochemical industry, he was offered a top spot at the Petrochemical Institute in Moscow. He was also associated with the Central Scientific Research Automobile and Automotive Engines Institute. He developed a kerosene fuel for battle tanks which proved a big factor in the Soviet battle against the Germans in World War II.

Tamil national question

In his interview, “‘Rajapaksas must honour their past commitments to India and the world’” (‘World’ page, September 19), Sri Lanka’s Tamil National Alliance (TNA) spokesman and Jaffna MP M.A. Sumanthiran correctly identifies that to resolve the problems faced by TNA’s constituents, broad-based support from the other communities including the majority Sinhala Buddhists is essential. In this light, it is worth noting that the Minister of Justice, Ali Sabry, has mentioned the present Rajapaksa government’s willingness to allocate funds for development projects in the Northern and Eastern provinces in amounts disproportionately higher compared to their shares of the population to make up for the missed development during the prolonged civil war. Mr. Sumanthiran is right: the government needs the blessings of the other communities to enact such programmes. However, it should also be noted that it is the very political behaviour of the TNA during the Wickremesinghe government (2015 to 2019) that undermined any support that could have been earned from other communities to further the TNA’s agenda. It was partly due to this factor that the TNA could not fulfil the promises given to the Tamils in the North and the East. As a result, the general election of 2020 saw a massive erosion of TNA’s vote base. I feel Mr. Sumanthiran has not yet captured the sentiments of the communities of Sri Lanka other than his own constituents in Jaffna district. So, he has failed to realise how his own party is responsible for its lacklustre electoral performance. I wish to lay out three points on how the majority community viewed the TNA’s digging of its own grave.

Protector of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe: the TNA received concessions from the Wickremesinghe government — the biggest one being the “Leader of the Opposition” post following the 2015 August general election, after having won only 16 out of 225 parliamentary seats. This was arranged despite the plea of a 54-member group led by Mahinda Rajapaksa to be recognised as the rightful opposition. The technical fact that this Rajapaksa-led faction contested under the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA), whose leader President Maithripala Sirisena and 41 MPs supporting him were part of the governing coalition was utilised to dismiss their claim.

Consequently, the TNA enjoyed privileges including a disproportionate say in the Constitutional Council enacted by the 19th Amendment to the constitution, its appointments, and even an undeservingly long speaking time in parliamentary debates. In return, the TNA protected the Wickremesinghe government despite the promise Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, the then Leader of the Opposition, extended to the majority community that he would represent all citizens of Sri Lanka who opposed the sitting government.

The TNA’s crypto-ally relationship with the Wickremesinghe government did not sit well with the majority population, who voted against the ruling coalition during the 2018 February local government election. Much worse, the TNA was perceived to be actively supporting the indifferent attitude of the Wickremesinghe government towards national security, to the fury of the majority.

Inefficient in serving the needs of the constituents: the TNA had a golden opportunity to deliver much-needed development to its constituents as it assumed the power of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) in 2013 and had a substantial say in the Eastern Provincial Council (EPC) upon the change in national government in 2015. As the ruling party of the NPC, it engaged in a constant tug-of-war over the separation of powers with the Governor and the national government, even after the 2015 election of a national government favourable to their cause. It lost sight of the significant work it could do through albeit the limited powers of the provincial council to uplift the standard of living of its constituents. Unfortunately, a massive proportion of the funds allocated to the provincial council by the central government had been returned without being utilised for productive public purposes.

Worse still, the TNA lost the purity of its mandate by the revelations of alleged corruption and wrongdoing against a couple of its Provincial Ministers, and accusations against the Chief Minister that he tried to cover up and downplay such allegations. The alliance was marred by constant infighting resulting in the eventual breakup with key personnel such as Arumugam Kandiah “Suresh” Premachandran, the leader of Eelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), and C.V. Vigneshwaran, the former NPC Chief Minister.

Sections of the majority community including the civil society activists who had set an optimistic expectation of the TNA’s approach to governance — that it would uphold greater values of public service compared to the perceivably sub-standard politicians rampant in the Sinhala-majority areas — have been left dismayed by this dismal report card. The TNA’s behaviour has even reinforced the theory propagated by certain elements of the Sinhala Buddhist community that the well-being of the average Tamils is secondary to the need for the power of the Tamil elite who have historically exploited the caste-based divisions in their society for political benefits.

Trickery: Mr. Sumanthiran, on behalf of the TNA, meticulously contributed with his legal expertise to the drafting of the 19th Aamendment to the constitution in 2015 as well as the subsequent new constitution the Wickremesinghe government intended to adopt. Although he was officially not a member of the ruling coalition, he was a prominent public face of such constitutional reforms, with constant appearances in media to defend their content. This engagement provided an opportunity for the non-Tamil citizenry to assess the TNA’s motivations.

The essence of the 1978 Second Republic Constitution of Sri Lanka is a presidential system of governance. The 19th Amendment violated this foundation by creating an alternative silo of power around the Prime Minister to compete with that of the Executive President. Regardless of whether the people favour a presidential or a parliamentary system, the deliberate weakening of the established structure of the government is unacceptable. It resulted in a nasty power struggle between the President and the Prime Minister which eventually contributed to the 2019 Easter Sunday Bombings through the failures of the security-intelligence apparatus. Mr. Sumanthiran, in his defence, later acknowledged the design failures of the 19th Amendment by stating that it was meant to be an interim arrangement until the new constitution was introduced.

However, the majority community would not accept the fiasco created by the 19th amendment as an inadvertent one, especially after seeing the trickery employed by TNA to justify the provisions of the new constitution backed by them.

For example, Mr. Sumanthiran lobbied against the current constitution’s article which states that Sri Lanka is a unitary country — in which only the national body has legislative powers — being included in the new constitution. At the same time, he insisted on refraining from mentioning explicitly that it will be a federal country, in which both national and provincial bodies have legislative powers. Instead of unitary or federal, the eminent lawyer Sumanthiran proposed to include legally ambiguous terms such as “united”, “undivided”, and “indivisible” that do not indicate which body has the powers of legislation. This episode precipitated a deep mistrust within the majority community — even among those who had been genuinely sympathetic toward its demand for a federal country — toward the TNA, in the backdrop of its constant advocacy for implementing transnational judiciary procedures on Sri Lanka’s internal matters. If the new constitution is neither unitary nor federal, will the TNA demand for a confederacy, a step very close to secession, for the Northern and Eastern provinces through a transnational judiciary procedure? The majority community has historically loathed foreign interventions in domestic affairs, and they are aware of the TNA’s potential ulterior motives.

What is next for the Tamils in Sri Lanka’s North and the East? In summary, the TNA’s servile and incompetent approach turned off the majority community — even those who had been sympathetic to their cause –— from actively championing to resolving the grievances of the TNA’s constituents. Interestingly, aside from the majority community, a significant section of the NE Tamils too saw through its game. As a result, the TNA could not retain the level of support it sustained in the general elections of 2001, 2004, 2010, and 2015 as the leading alliance in the North and the East. In 2020, out of the 29 parliamentary seats in the Northern and Eastern provinces, the ruling party led by Mahinda Rajapaksa and its affiliates have won 11. Other Muslim parties have won seven seats, while the ultra-nationalist Tamil parties have won two. This has left Tamil National Alliance with only nine seats from district-wise proportional allocations. In my view, the plurality support enjoyed by the governing party and its allies has opened an avenue for the people of the North and the East to work hand in hand with the sitting government for the first time since 1965. Whether the government would make full use of this rare opportunity and how TNA would react to such endeavours remain to be seen.

314,2020/10/03,‘Ka Pae Ranasingam’ movie review: A sketchy pay-per-view film,"Its rudderless and painfully long narrative aside, the Aishwarya Rajessh-starrer is still a sharp commentary on the shortcomings of a functional democracy

It was an anticipated debut: a Tamil film releasing directly on a newly launched pay-per-view (PPV) platform.

But of course, Ka Pae Ranasingam did not arrive without hiccups. The film is available to view via the PPV service Zee Plex (for customers of DTH platforms), as well as the streaming platform ZEE5. Except it cannot be viewed using the OTT platform’s mobile app, at least not yet.

P Virumandi Storyline: A woman fights State apathy to bring back the body of her dead husband from abroad

Viewing Ka Pae Ranasingam via ZEE5 website was an experience, and not of the good kind. Exacerbating the displeasure of a stop-start viewing experience (slow streaming and sudden failure to support Google Chrome as a browser, to name a few) was the film’s runtime: 2 hours and 57 minutes.

It is the kind of time the Stanley Kubricks and Alfred Hitchcocks of the world didn’t need, but for some reason Tamil filmmakers seem to. Perhaps, it was director Virumandi’s way of giving maximum movie for the rental paid (₹199) that the editor’s role was deemed unnecessary.

To put it simply, Ka Pae Ranasingam is painfully long. We are introduced to Ariyanachi (Aishwarya Rajessh) from a village in Ramanathapuram district. She is married to Ranasingam (Vijay Sethupathi), who is working on an off-shore oil plant in Dubai. One day, she gets the news that he is killed, and she is told a false reason for his death.

The future of PPV There are other things of note that PPV platforms must keep in mind while fixing the rental price for a film. Movie buffs in Tamil Nadu are used to paying the price quoted by Zee Plex for Ka Pae Ranasingam for a complete theatrical experience. That means: watching the film on a computer browser and watching it on the big screen with air-conditioning and Dolby Atmos sound effects are two different things.

Also, relative to the pricing, the rental duration ought to be extended. Zee Plex affords only six hours to view the film once the play button is pressed, which, for a movie with nearly three-hour runtime, is both inadequate and illogical. If PPV services cannot afford the same luxury as an OTT platform (especially, the option of resuming playback at a later time), then its purpose will be deemed defeated.

The other major concern is power disruptions. PPV services operating in the West don’t need to account for unplanned power outages because they are almost unheard of, unlike in our country. What if you are two hours into a movie and then the power supply in your neighbourhood fails for the next four hours? Will there be a refund?

These questions are as yet unanswered, and these are besides issues like slow streaming. If PPV is to survive its initial interest phase, more relaxation in terms of rental fee, duration and playback time should be considered. Otherwise, PPV services will run into the brick walls fast being built by OTT platforms.

A distraught Ariyanachi then recounts her meeting Ranasingam, the water diviner, prior to their marriage. The screenplay adopts a non-linear narrative, and weaves together flashbacks and present-day happenings to give us a picture of Ranasingam — a man who leads from the front the villagers’ years-long fight to secure drinking water from the State.

Gradually, Ranasingam finds that the resistance he strived to build is fading, and so to secure the future of his family, he, too, heads abroad but never returns.

Back to the present day, and we see Ariyanachi made to run from pillar to post to bring back her dead husband: her journey takes her all the way to the Prime Minister of India; the filmmaker builds his screenplay by grabbing incidents that made headlines in the past few years and then turning them into scenes.

Due credit to Virumandi, the debutant filmmaker, for his writing (dialogues) is razor sharp in places.

There is also a touch of simplicity in the manner his scenes are crafted, an appreciable quality since most debut filmmakers fall for the trappings of Tamil cinema and try to go overboard with the drama quotient.

State apathy doesn’t hit you hard — or slap you across the face, if you will — like in a Shankar film. It happens, it is usual and there is nothing you can do to change it. There is no feeling of helplessness or desperation that these scenes leave in you. It doesn’t move you, at all, and that there is how reality sans fiction feels like. Think of the injustice that happened in Hathras days ago, and think of the nationwide outrage that followed... oh no, that was a dream!

Aishwarya Rajessh aces her role as Ariyanachi; hers is not a nuanced performance but it is a character she portrays with effortless ease. Maybe, affording your lead actor more screen time (or close-ups) could have helped.

This is the biggest gripe one is likely to have with Ka Pae Ranasingam. Vijay Sethupathi is, on paper, playing a cameo. But the spectre of Ranasingam looms large on the canvas of a film that should have instead been all about Ariyanachi. It is also a sign of how things work in Tamil cinema.

So long as this industry has more male-sponsored narratives of the female perspective of things, even the so-called ‘female-centric’ films will not permit its female lead to stamp their authority.

A tip of the hat to actor Abhishek, who despite the limited scope of his character (a Government official), was one of only three or four actors in the film who delivers a close-to-believable performance.

Despite its flaws, Ka Pae Ranasingam offers interesting commentary on State apathy. If you can gather enough patience to last its runtime in one sitting, and can also look past the shortcomings of its PPV host, Ka Pae Ranasingam can indeed be some experience.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/mo5t38/article32759228.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ka-Pae-Ranasingam-5,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/ka-pae-ranasingam-movie-review-a-sketchy-pay-per-view-film/article32759229.ece
315,2020/10/03,‘Suspend investigating officer in Ashwini Bidre murder case’,"Victim’s husband appeals to Ajit Pawar

Raju Gore, the husband of murdered policewoman Ashwini Bidre, has written to Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar demanding suspension of the investigating officer in the case.

In his letter, Mr. Gore accused Assistant Commissioner of Police Vinod Chavan of the Navi Mumbai Crime Branch, of aiding the accused. Mr. Gore said, “Senior advocate Pradeep Gharat, who is the Special Public Prosecutor in the case, is a senior citizen. During such times, stepping out is dangerous for him. Yet, he has been attending all the hearings. Mr. Chavan is expected to inform Mr. Gharat about the dates of hearing and the bail applications filed by the accused beforehand so that Mr. Gharat gets enough time to prepare.”

‘Lack of cooperation’

Mr. Gore said there was a hearing on September 28 on the bail application filed by one of the accused, but Mr. Chavan informed Mr. Gharat about it only on Sunday night. Mr. Gore said Mr. Gharat managed to prepare for the matter and the Bombay High Court issued an order extending the trial period in the case by another year. The trial began at the Panvel sessions court in November 2019 and the court had initially directed that the trial be expedited and completed within a year.

Mr. Gore also demanded that Assistant Commissioner of Police Sangeeta Alphonso, who had been appointed last year by the Maharashtra Director General of Police to assist Mr. Gharat in the trial, be transferred to the Navi Mumbai Police and made the investigating officer in the case.

‘Unsatisfactory conduct’

Mr. Gharat said, “There has been unsatisfactory conduct at the police’s end in this murder case.” Mr. Chavan, who has been hospitalised after testing positive for COVID-19, was unavailable for comment.

Bidre, an assistant police inspector posted with the Protection of Civil Rights Unit in Konkan Bhavan in Belapur and resident of Roadpali in Kalamboli, went missing on April 15, 2016. A case was registered on July 14, 2016, by her brother Anand Bidre.

On January 31, 2017, a kidnapping case was registered following which the key suspect, police inspector Abhay Kurundkar, who was attached to the Thane Rural Police, was arrested on December 7, 2017. Three more accomplices have been arrested in the case. According to the police, after killing Bidre, the accused dismembered the body and dumped it in Mira-Bhayander creek.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2uc1xg/article32762574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3BMASHWINIBIDRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/suspend-investigating-officer-in-ashwini-bidre-murder-case/article32762575.ece
316,2020/10/03,"Seven, including three students, arrested for highway robberies","Accused targeted motorists on Sion-Panvel highway

The Sanpada police have arrested seven people, including three students, for allegedly being involved in several robberies on the Sion-Panvel highway. Of the three students, two are minors, the police said.

On September 30, Nandkumar Subhash Daate (25), a resident of Karanjale in Panvel who had a fish business, was robbed on the highway in Sanpada.

The incident occurred at 2 a.m. when Mr. Daate, along with his partner Ajinkya Padval, were returning from Sassoon Dock in Mr. Padval’s car. After reaching Sanpada, they stopped the car to answer nature’s call.

While Mr. Daate stepped out, Mr. Padval stayed inside the car. Later, when Mr. Daate was getting back into the car, an autorickshaw approached them. Three people came out of the auto and attacked the duo. Later, four more people got out of the auto and assaulted Mr. Daate and Mr. Padval.

The assailants stole a mobile phone and ₹32,000 in cash. The duo then managed to snatch the key of the auto, but the accused started pelting stones at them and they returned the keys.

Mr. Padval memorised the last four digits of the autorickshaw’s licence plate number and mentioned it in his police complaint. “We got the details of five autorickshaws with the same last four digits, verified each one and finally traced the accused,” said assistant police inspector Keshav Dinde.

The accused have been identified as Sachin Lakshman Kale (21), Vyankatesh Vijay Chavan (21), Bonney Shankar Salunkhe (21), Vishal Vinod Kolhe (20), and Siddhant Praveen More (18). All the accused are residents of Nerul.

Following the arrest, it was found that the accused had also conducted two highway robberies at Nerul and one within the APMC limits using the same modus operandi. “The accused have been handed over to the Nerul police for interrogation in the robbery case. We suspect the accused might have committed many such robberies and we are investigating the matter further,” Mr. Dinde said",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/seven-including-three-students-arrested-for-highway-robberies/article32762549.ece
317,2020/10/03,"Kshitij Prasad: I was coerced into falsely implicating Ranbir, Rampal","Kshitij Prasad has been remanded in judicial custody till October 6.

Kshitij Prasad, executive producer of Dharma Productions, told the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act court on Saturday that he had been repeatedly harassed and coerced into falsely implicating actors Ranbir Kapoor, Arjun Rampal and Dino Morea.

Mr. Prasad was arrested on September 26 and remanded in the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) custody the next day till October 3. He was produced before the special judge Gaurav for remand by the NCB.

When the Judge asked if he had any complaint, Mr. Prasad went in the witness box and made the following statement, “Since September 27, I have been harassed and coerced into falsely implicating actors Ranbir Kapoor, Arjun Rampal and Dino Morea. I say that in the manner I am being mentally, emotionally and psychologically harassed and abused by the NCB”.

He has been remanded in judicial custody till October 6.

Advocate Satish Maneshinde, for Mr Prasad, had told the court that his client was “harassed and blackmailed to make a statement apart from third degree and ill- treatment.” He also told the court that, “Kshitij was categorically informed by Sameer Wankhede [NCB officer], in the presence of several other officers, that since he was associated with Dharma Productions, they would let him off if he implicated either Karan Johar, Somel Mishra, Rakhi, Apoorva, Neeraj or Rahil, falsely alleging that they consumed drugs. Kshitij refused to comply with this despite the pressure being mounted on him as he did not know any of these people personally and did not wish to falsely implicate anyone.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/lnvsei/article32760904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KSHITIJPRASAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kshitij-prasad-i-was-coerced-into-falsely-implicating-ranbir-rampal/article32760905.ece
318,2020/10/03,HC grants bail to man accused of raping ex-wife,"The Bombay High Court recently granted bail to a man accused of raping and sexually harassing his ex-wife who has dyslexia.

They had got married in June 2003, and have two children. The woman alleged that on June 15, 2017, her ex-husband Jignesh Dangarwala took her out for a walk. Then Mr. Dangarwala’s friend Rajiv came in a car and her husband made her sit in the front seat with Mr. Rajiv.

She said she was reluctant and she was forced to sit in the car, and then Mr. Rajiv started touching her indecently. She alleged that Mr. Rajiv then took both of them to his house in Malad and had forced intercourse with her. When she came out of the room and told her ex-husband about it, he told her not to tell anyone and assured her that this would not happen again.

An FIR was lodged by the woman against her ex-husband at Samata Nagar police station on December 17, 2019, describing sexual harassment incidents with different persons named as Ravi alias Rohit and Tushar at Borivali in October 2018 and at Dahisar in February 2019. She also claimed to have complained about the incidents to her father-in-law but he did not pay any heed and uttered indecent words to her.

Mr. Dangarwala was charged with Sections 376 (punishment for rape), 376 E (punishment for repeat offenders), 354 (assault of criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354 A (sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment), 354 C (voyeurism), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

She defended the delay in registering the FIR as she was undergoing some treatment at a hospital for her pain in knees and waist. She argued that she had dyslexia and her ex-husband who she left in August 2019 was in a dominant position and had forced her to indulge in such activity.

A single judge Bench of Justice S.V. Kotwal took into account that Mr. Tushar and Mr. Ravi had been granted bail, and directed that Mr. Dangarwala be released on bail on furnishing a PR bond of ₹25,000.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-grants-bail-to-man-accused-of-raping-ex-wife/article32756006.ece

322,2020/10/03,Siblings suffocate to death in locked car,"Police rule out foul play; to question owner of garage

Two brothers, aged three and five, have died of suffocation after being trapped in a car at the garage of a scrap dealer in Mahad. The Mahad MIDC police on Friday ruled out foul play, but said that they are investigating if there was any negligence on the part of the garage’s owner.

The police said the siblings, Sohail and Abbas, went missing shortly after they stepped outside their house in Nangalwadi chawl to play at 4.30 p.m. on Thursday. While their father was away, their mother, who was in the kitchen, alerted locals when the duo did not return home. Around 7.30 p.m., the brothers were found dead inside a Honda City car in the garage. The locals smashed the car’s windows and pulled out the children. They were rushed to hospital, where they were declared dead on arrival.

“The car had a manual locking system. The siblings might have entered it while playing and got trapped inside. Their father was also a scrap dealer and the garage belonged to their neighbour. We will record his statement and find out if he should be booked for negligence.

323,2020/10/03,Mercedes-AMG GLE 53 Coupe 4Matic+ launched,"Mercedes has launched the second-generation GLE Coupe in India with the GLE 53 Coupe. Priced at ₹1.20 crore (ex-showroom, India), the GLE 53 Coupe is the first ‘53’ badged model to launch in India and essentially replaces the first-gen GLE 43 Coupe.

Powering the GLE 53 Coupe is a 435hp, 3.0-litre, in-line, six-cylinder, twin-turbo petrol engine. The unit is paired with a 48V mild-hybrid system that adds up to 22hp and 250Nm of torque under hard acceleration. Power is sent to all four wheels via a 9-speed automatic gearbox and Mercedes’ 4Matic+ all-wheel-drive system. Mercedes claims a 0-100kph sprint time of 5.3sec, while the top speed is limited to 250kph.

The GLE 53 also gets a sportier air suspension set-up along with active roll stabilisation that uses a 48V system to reduce body roll during cornering and improve ride when required.

In terms of design, there is some family resemblance with the standard GLE though the Coupe gets a more flowing, coupe-like roofline and distinctive rear end design replete with an integrated spoiler on this AMG model. This AMG model, furthermore, gets sportier design details such as the vertical-slat Panamerica grille, 21-inch alloy wheels, and an AMG exhaust.

Inside, the dashboard is the same as the standard GLE with dual 12.3-inch displays for the infotainment and instrument cluster. However, here too there are some AMG-specific touches such as the flat-bottom steering, sport front seats and stainless-steel pedals.

There is plenty of kit on offer, including adaptive LED headlights, a head-up display, four-zone climate control, a 13-speaker Burmester sound system, heated and ventilated front seats with memory function, a panoramic sunroof and a powered tailgate. Safety kit includes nine airbags, a blind spot monitor, a 360 degree camera and ESP.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/up5xa2/article32761787.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MPMercedes-AMGGLE53Coupe4Maticlaunchedjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/mercedes-amg-gle-53-coupe-4matic-launched/article32761788.ece

Priced at a premium of ₹65,000, the Endeavour Sport features blacked-out cosmetic elements to the SUV’s exterior in a bid to give the SUV a sportier look.

Compared to the standard Endeavour, the Sport gets a raft of cosmetic changes to the exterior. Starting from up front, the headlamps now get a smoked finish, the three-slat chrome grille has been replaced by a new gloss black grille with a honeycomb pattern, the skid plate too is now finished in black and all of the chrome detailing too has been darkened. The blacked-out theme carries on to the sides as well, with the new alloy wheels, roof rails, fender vents and wing mirrors also finished in black. Around the back, too, the silver and chrome trim has been blacked out.

The Endeavour Sport is available in a choice of three colours, Absolute Black, Diffused Silver and Diamond White.

Moving to the cabin, there is no notable change here, and the dual-tone, beige-and-grey interiors continue as before.

325,2020/10/03,Toyota Urban Cruiser launched,"Toyota has launched its first compact SUV, the Urban Cruiser in India with prices starting at ₹8.40 lakh. Based on the Maruti Vitara Brezza, the Urban Cruiser is the second shared model between the two companies following the Baleno-based Glanza.

As with the Glanza, there is not a bare-bones ‘base’ variant with the Urban Cruiser and the range instead begins with the pretty well-equipped ‘Mid’ variant. This ‘entry-level’ Urban Cruiser Mid variant is equivalent to the mid-spec Vitara Brezza VXi. Standard features include LED headlights, LED DRLs, LED tail-lights, a 2-DIN audio system with Bluetooth, steering-mounted controls, keyless entry and go and auto climate control. The fully-loaded model, additionally, adds in 16-inch alloys, a 7.0-inch touchscreen, an auto-dimming inside rear view mirror, cruise control and automatic wipers.

There is a sole petrol engine on offer, a 1.5-litre, naturally aspirated unit, which makes 105hp and 138Nm. The engine is paired with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed torque convertor automatic gearbox with the latter benefiting from fuel-saving mild-hybrid technology.

Visually, the Urban Cruiser and Vitara Brezza can be differentiated just from the front end, the rear and sides are too similar to tell apart from a distance. The Urban Cruiser's interior is also only slightly different from the Maruti.

Compared to its rivals in the compact SUV segment, the Urban Cruiser is neither the most expensive nor the most affordable. Rivals in the segment include the Mahindra XUV300, Ford EcoSport, Maruti Vitara Brezza, Kia Sonet, Tata Nexon and Hyundai Venue.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/5dc8df/article32761594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MPToyotaUrbanCruiserlaunchedjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/toyota-urban-cruiser-launched/article32761595.ece
326,2020/10/03,"Yamaha Ray ZR: Fuel efficiency, a smooth motor and light kerb weight","The most significant difference between the Ray ZR and Yamaha’s other new 125cc scooter, the Fascino, is the styling

Yamaha’s Ray ZR is designed to appeal to a younger audience, and here is what it is like.

The most significant difference between the Ray ZR and Yamaha’s other new 125cc scooter, the Fascino, is the styling. The apron is divided into matte plastic and gloss-paint panels, while faux air vents on the sides give the front end a wide appearance.

At the handlebar, you will find a little windscreen with a unique LED DRL. While it does seem over the top, some may find the cyclops-looking front end rather appealing. The side panels look sporty and rake upwards to meet a matte black section that houses the tail-light.

The extensive bodywork and the new platform have resulted in a relatively larger scooter. Despite this, Yamaha has brought the kerb weight down to an impressive 99kg, which makes it one of the lightest 125cc scooters. There is a fairly spacious 21-litre boot, but no underseat storage light.

Unlike the Fascino, the Ray ZR does feature digital instrumentation. While it is quite informative, it is nowhere close to that of its direct rival, the TVS Ntorq 125.

Specifications Engine 125cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled, fuel injected

Max Power (hp @ rpm) 8.2hp at 6500rpm

Max Torque (nm @ rpm) 9.7Nm at 5000rpm

Weight (kg) 99kg

Wheel base (mm) 1280mm

Ground Clearance (mm) 145mm

Seat height(mm) 785mm

Fuel Tank capacity (lts) 5.2 litres

Front Brake Type Disc

Rear Brake Type Drum

Front Suspension Telescopic fork

Rear Suspension Monoshock

Front Tyre 90/90-12

Rear Tyre 110/90-10

The Ray ZR puts out 8.2hp and 9.7Nm of torque, but the low kerb weight puts it among the quickest scooters in India. In wet conditions, the scooter managed to get to 60kph in just 8.46sec and the roll on-test figures were impressive too. This scooter performs well and the motor remains smooth throughout.

The low kerb weight is a gift that keeps on giving, with the scooter’s fuel efficiency being an impressive 56.79kpl in the city and 62.80kpl on the highway. The stop-start feature is another contributing factor. Unfortunately, the system does not start as quickly as it should when you twist the accelerator. The Ray ZR’s slightly different seat does help to a minor extent, but most of its rivals are more comfortable. The Ray uses a 12-inch front- and 10-inch rear-wheel setup that offers decent handling and stability. The brakes on this scooter are not the best feeling, but they get the Ray ZR to a stop quite quickly.

The Ray ZR 125 has a lot going for it, but it misses out on some features, and the comfort factor could improve. On the upside, it performs well while also being quite fuel efficient. With prices ranging from ₹69,530 for the drum brake variant to ₹73,530 for the disc brake equipped Street Rally variant, the Ray ZR is a very competent product, but not a game changer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/lssyyz/article32761360.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MPYamaha1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/yamaha-ray-zr-fuel-efficiency-a-smooth-motor-and-light-kerb-weight/article32761361.ece
327,2020/10/03,MG Gloster: The highway is where the powerful engine comes alive,"On the whole, the SUV comes across as a pleasant surprise with impressive specs and a lot of substance

On paper, the MG Gloster has some impressive numbers. It is longer and taller than all its rivals and packs in the most powerful diesel engine in the class. So how does the package come together on the road?

The Gloster is truly a massive SUV with loads of all-important road presence, though it lacks a distinctive design with no visual link to other MGs in India. Still, the slim LED projector headlamps, large brushed-metal grille and sculpted bonnet are quite attractive and the dummy quad exhausts lend it a sporty look. There is also a lot of tastefully executed chrome detailing all over the car.

Open the front doors and you are treated to dashboard draped in tan leather, with double-stitching, brushed aluminium trim and lots of layers.

The 12.3-inch touchscreen is bright and colourful, of a reasonably high resolution and makes good use of its wide-screen aspect ratio with neatly arranged function ‘tiles’. There is also an 8.0-inch colour screen sitting between the dials. The display is crisp and fluid and overshadows the analogue tachometer and speedometer positioned on either side.

The front seats also make a good first impression. They are power-adjustable, heated, quite large and generously cushioned. The driver’s seat goes a bit further, with seat ventilation, massage and a memory function. Lumbar support though, even at its lowest setting, is a bit excessive, and the cushioning all round is firm.

Forward visibility is great thanks to upright A-pillars and a relatively low-set dash, but rear visibility is hampered by the big rear seat head restraints.

Specifications LENGTH 4985mm

WIDTH 1926mm

HEIGHT 1867mm

WHEELBASE 2950mm

KERB WEIGHT 2518kg

TYRE SIZE (F|R) 255/55 R19

FUEL TANK CAPACITY 75 litres

ENGINE 1996cc, 4-cyls, twin-turbo diesel

POWER 218hp at 4000rpm

TORQUE 480Nm at 1500-2400rpm

GEARBOX 8-speed automatic

In the second row, the two individual seats are almost as generously cushioned as the ones up front and, while not powered, offer a long range of fore-and-aft travel and a fair amount of recline, which in combination with the space makes the Gloster’s middle row by far the most comfortable in its class. Space in the third row is also easily the best in the segment. You might be sat low and support may be lacking but headroom is decent and kneeroom is exceptional.

The Gloster is also loaded to the gills with equipment. You get a massive panoramic sunroof, three-zone climate control, wireless phone charging, ambient lighting, an electronic parking brake with auto hold and more.

Then there are the advanced driver aids, many of which you can otherwise find only in high-end luxury cars — blind-spot warning, lane-departure warning, frontal collision warning, autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control.

The in-house-developed, 1,996cc, twin-turbo diesel under the hood of the Gloster punches out 218hp and 480Nm, making it the most powerful in its class. Drive goes to the rear via an 8-speed torque-converter automatic, with an on-demand 4WD system engaging when necessary.

Performance is impressive, with the Gloster doing 0-100kph in 11.21sec in our tests. Similarly in roll-on acceleration, 20-80kph and 40-100kph too were dispatched in a quick 6.57sec and 8.77sec respectively. Braking too is impressive, with the behemoth stopping from 80kph in just 2.56sec and 25 metres.

However, the engine’s bottom end is particularly weak and the SUV feels unusually sluggish below 2,000rpm. This is only exacerbated by the slow responses of the gearbox, which often takes time to select the right gear.

The highway is where this engine, feels most comfortable with its big reserves of torque and long-legged gearing making it an effortless mile muncher. Gearshifts on the move are unobtrusive and you will always have enough power in reserve.

Refinement too is really exceptional and ride quality is also really good as far as ladder-frame SUV go. High-speed composure too is impressive and the Gloster can suppress broken roads without flinching. There is quite a bit of body roll and high-speed, lane-change manoeuvres should be made with some consideration for your passengers.

The steering is light and offers reasonable amount of feedback and confidence at speed. It is safe to say the Gloster has the best ride and handling mix in the segment right now.

The MG Gloster comes across as a pleasant surprise with impressive specs and a lot of substance. The only fly in the ointment appears to be the sluggish response at low speeds, which can make city driving pretty taxing.

What we do not know yet is the price, but what we hear is that this top-spec Savvy version will be priced just above the established competition, at around ₹35 lakh (ex-showroom). Only time will tell if the Gloster can make as big an impact as the Hector.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/w9aaaa/article32761230.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MPGloster7JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/mg-gloster-the-highway-is-where-the-powerful-engine-comes-alive/article32761231.ece
328,2020/10/03,Zig not zag,"In a world where people tend to go with the flow, I learned how hard it can be, to be different.

So, we’ve been learning about the Father of our Nation all this week. Our History teacher, N Ma’am gave us a ‘challenge’ (which is basically teacher speak for homework).

Each of us had to try and live by Gandhiji’s principles of truth, non-violence and simplicity for a week. And then write a 1000-word essay about our experience. (Insert eye roll.)

Now, I’ll admit, I was a little cocky at the start of the week. How hard could this be? A+ for sure!

And then, I learned that the easier something sounds, the harder it is.

Challenge accepted

Take ‘truth’ for example. I wouldn’t say I’m a huge liar or anything, but it’s amazing how many ‘white’ lies I tell in a day! ‘Yes, Ma’am I’m paying attention to what you’re saying’. ‘Yeah, I took the dog for a walk’. ‘No, this cake doesn’t taste like a brick.’ Sometimes I didn’t want to get into trouble, sometimes I didn’t want to hurt someone else’s feelings and sometimes I just wanted another 10 minutes of gaming. I learned that the only way to not have to lie is to do what’s expected of you in the first place. Which isn’t always fun.

I bet Gandhiji would have scratched non-violence from his list of principles if he lived with the Pesky Brother. Also, I’m not entirely sure about the whole ‘turn the other cheek’ thing. The second the PB knew I wasn’t going to hit or fight back, he went around tripping me up, giving me Chinese burns and even pantsed me on the basketball court. Who needs enemies when you have a brother? It took every cell in my body not to hang him from the basketball hoop by his shorts. But here’s the thing; after the first three days of non-violence on my part, and extreme violence on the PB’s part, he lost interest in baiting me and left me alone. But tell me, now that the challenge is over, should I exact revenge or leave him alone?

Simplicity means different things to different people. I decided that I’d only wear one outfit the entire week. My family and building friends didn’t appreciate my efforts though and the PB refused to sleep in the same room as me. After the first three days, I realised the bad smell following me everywhere was me. Eww. So I had to shower and change my underwear.

The challenge aka homework did get me thinking about how hard it is to be different and stay the course even when the world is calling you nuts. We all like to look at great people and the things they’ve achieved and say how cool they are, but I don’t think we look at how hard it actually is to do your own thing — to zig when everyone else is zagging.

Is it worth it? I guess so. After all, Gandhiji got India independence all those years ago. Thanks for zigging, Bapu!",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/5kvq5n/article32758757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02YTBUGBOY-2,https://www.thehindu.com/children/zig-not-zag/article32758758.ece
329,2020/10/03,Doctors’ strike disrupts outpatient services at public health centres in Puducherry,"Healthcare workers are striking, seeking the inclusion of non-bailable sections against an inspector of police, who assaulted a duty doctor and nurse at the Indira Gandhi Government General Hospital and Research Institute

Healthcare workers on Saturday refused to attend outpatient service duties at all government hospitals, seeking the inclusion of non-bailable sections against Inspector of Police Mettupalayam, S. Shanmugasundaram, for assaulting a duty doctor and nurse at the Indira Gandhi Government General Hospital and Research Institute (GH).

A case was registered on Friday against the Inspector under section 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly) 294(b) (punishment for using obscene words), 332 (punishment for assault on government servant), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 356 (punishment for attempt to theft) read with 149 (punishment for unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code.

The case was registered after a complaint of assault by the Inspector and others, on a duty doctor and nurse over alleged medical negligence which caused the death of the Inspector’s father.

According to GH authorities, the Inspector’s 80-year-old father was brought to the GH in a serious condition. Medical interventions did not help in saving him, and he died on Thursday night.

Mr. Shanmugasundaram entered into an argument with the duty doctor and after abusing him, physically assaulted him. He also took away the mobile phone of the nurse.

“He is a law enforcement officer and not an ordinary citizen. Even if has got a grievance about the medical treatment provided by the doctors, he has enough avenues to complaint. Instead, he assaulted and used all kind of filthy language against the duty doctor and nurse. This has a become a routine affair at GH, especially during night hours,” a senior doctor said.

A nurse at the GH said the government should immediately install CCTV cameras at the GH and Medical College to identify miscreants who create trouble. A Bill was passed by the Legislative Assembly to ensure strict punishment to people who attack healthcare workers, but it is yet to be implemented in the Union Territory.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/lgy8w/article32758396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03OCTTH--Docsjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/doctors-strike-disrupts-outpatient-services-at-public-health-centres-in-puducherry/article32758399.ece

Hundred more ambulances would soon join the fleet of 108 ambulance service in the State, Health Minister C.Vijaya Baskar said here on Saturday.

“The state already had 1,000 ambulances. Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami had ordered the purchase of 500 more at a cost of ₹103 crore in view of the pandemic. Of these, 108 vehicles joined the fleet recently and another 100 ambulances will be added within a week or two,” Mr. Vijaya Baskar said after inaugurating a job fair held at the Mother Teresa College of Engineering and Technology campus at Illupur to recruit candidates for the ‘108’ ambulance service here.

Mr. Vijaya Baskar disclosed that the 108 service received about 15,000 calls a day on an average and at least 4,000 people benefited by the service in a day. During the pandemic period alone, 2.50 persons had availed the service.

Referring to the pandemic situation in the state, Mr.Vijaya Baskar said so far over 5.52 lakh COVID 19 patients have been treated in the state. Follow-up clinics for COVID-19 recovered patients have been opened in all government medical college hospitals in the state. All COVID 19 recovered patients should visit the clinics without fail to check the functions of their lungs and other organs.

There should be no lax on the part of the officials in conducting fever camps and other preventive steps. The spread had been controlled. However, the officials should follow proactive steps to control the virus more.

Mr. Saravanavelraj said that the officials of agriculture and cooperation should ensure the availability of fertilizers, micro-nutrients and pesticides to the farmers, who had taken up samba cultivation in the district.

Similarly, the official machinery should get ready for facing the northeast monsoon.

335,2020/10/03,Vegetable traders worried about lack adequate facilities at G. Corner grounds,"TIRUCHI

With the northeast monsoon just about two weeks away, the vegetable and fruits traders, who operate out of the temporary wholesale market, are worried about continuing trade at the market once the monsoon sets in as the G. Corner grounds lack adequate infrastructure.

As part of the precautionary measures in the wake of the spread of COVID-19 and to prevent the people from assembling in large numbers, the Tiruchi district administration closed the Gandhi Market in the last week of March and subsequently shifted its operation initially to the Chennai Bypass Road and later to G. Corner, an open ground owned by the railways.

The stopgap arrangement was expected to serve the purpose for one or two months. But, the traders continue to function in the open space for more than 6 months. There is absolutely no basic infrastructure for the traders to stock and store the fresh arrival and unsold vegetables and fruits. The traders allege that they have been undergoing trying times in the absence of facilities to safeguard the money, keep the weighing machines, place to take rest and for other purposes.

According to a rough estimate, there are about 180 wholesale and 200 retail shops at the temporary market. It attracts about 4,000 wholesale and retail traders, grocery traders and loadmen.

Except a few mobile toilets and drinking water containers, there is nothing to protect the traders from heat, rain and wind. Toilets are said to be highly inadequate to meet the requirement of 4,000 and odd traders.

When the retail traders, who operate at Uzhavar Sandhai at Anna Nagar, were given a makeshift shed, no such provision was made at G. Corner, apparently due to the reservation expressed by the Southern Railway to erect or build any solid infrastructure. Troubled over the frequent rains, a few traders erected makeshift sheds a few weeks ago, but only to be removed by the railway authorities.

Though the traders manage to continue their trade despite of a few spells of rain between June and September, they are worried about the prospects of the trade during the northeast monsoon, which is expected to set in in the third week of October. Many of them vie for moving back to the Gandhi Market.

“I do not think it will be easy to carry on trade during the monsoon as it may rain heavily and continue for at least 5 to 6 days for each spell. We will be forced to cease our operation if concrete alternative arrangements are not made,” says Kamalakannan, a trader at G. Corner.

A.N.P. Mohamed Ahathu, another trader, said that the traders had been undergoing untold ordeals. The authorities would understand their sufferings only when they visited the market on a rainy day at night. The condition would become worse once the monsoon set in.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/spxvg6/article32760734.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY04MARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/vegetable-traders-worried-about-lack-adequate-facilities-at-g-corner-grounds/article32760735.ece
336,2020/10/03,Analysis done to trace patients with viral pneumonia symptoms,"THANJAVUR

The district administration has conducted an analysis to find and trace patients with symptoms of viral pneumonia detected through chest CT- scans.

The aim is to supplement the RT-PCR tests in detecting COVID-19 and reducing the fatality rate in the district, officials say.

Officials reviewed the CT - scan reports taken across 21 scan centres in the district from July to September.

Using the data, health officials, including village health nurses (VHN) and block medical officers, trace and test them for COVID-19 and provide treatment, M. Govinda Rao, Collector, told The Hindu.

S. Maruthudurai, Dean, Thanjavur Medical College Hospital, said that of all CT scans taken between June and September, 50 to 60% of the patients showed symptoms of viral pneumonia. The number of patients whose CT scans showed lung involvement in the moderate and severe range was 10 in July, by September, there were 100 patients in the moderate range and 150 patients in the severe range. Steps to trace and treat these patients were taken following this report, he said.

The study has helped patients save valuable time as it allows doctors to monitor the blood oxygenation levels in patients, and treat them before COVID-19 symptoms, if at all, manifest. “VHNs and health officials are provided with the data taken from the scan centres, so that they may trace the individuals whose CT-scans show signs of oxygenation levels below 95%. The patients are informed of their ill health and are given the option to choose to be admitted to Thanjavur Medical College Hospital, or any of the 10 empanelled private hospitals,” he said.

While most patients agree to get admitted to a hospital, there are some who disagree and later begin to show symptoms of COVID-19, including cough and breathlessness and by then, their blood oxygenation levels drop to below 85 and the patients require immediate medical attention.

At the TMCH, a separate ‘Suspected COVID-19’ ward has been set up where patients with lung involvement and symptoms of viral pneumonia detected through CT-scans are admitted.

“An RT-PCR test is lifted and if it returns positive, the patients are shifted to the COVID ward, otherwise, they are treated for pneumonia at the ward itself.

“If the RT-PCR test returns negative, we do not want cross-infection to occur,” Mr. Rao said. The hospital is well stocked with medicines, including Remdesivir, an antiviral drug to treat the patients.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/analysis-done-to-trace-patients-with-viral-pneumonia-symptoms/article32760255.ece
337,2020/10/03,Farmers call for prompt procurement,"THANJAVUR

Farmers who had taken up ‘kuruvai’ cultivation in Thanjavur district on a large extent of area with confidence after nearly a gap of nine years complain of procurement delays in Thanjavur district.

Kuruvai paddy cultivation was taken up on around 59,900 hectares (ha) in Thanjavur district this season as against 37,000 ha last year. The timely release of water from Stanley Reservoir in Mettur on the scheduled date of June 12 this year had enthused the farmers to take up `kuruvai’ cultivation on a larger extent of area this season.

According to official sources, the crop raised on about 40,000 ha was harvested by the end of September and nearly 7,71,000 metric tonnes of paddy was procured from the farmers through 166 direct procurement centres opened in the district till last month-end.

As the ‘kharif’ season 2020-21 has commenced from October 1, another 60 DPCs had been opened in the district for procuring paddy from the farmers, official sources said.

However, a section of farmers had a different story to narrate and counter the claims made by the officials with respect to the procurement of ‘kuruvai’ paddy.

S. Rajendran of Kannankudi Kizhaiyur in Orathanadu block laments that he was unable to sell the paddy harvested from his field at the DPC in view of the erratic functioning of the facility over the past few weeks.

“Paddy is procured for two or three days in a week and at the same time farmers are advised to bring their produce for measuring on the date fixed by the DPC staff. Thus we are finding it difficult to protect the produce from the vagaries of nature”, he added.

Endorsing Mr. Rajendran’s statement, Sundara Vimalanathan, secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, claimed that the change in procurement process adopted by the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation this season had pushed the farmers to a piquant situation.

Asking the farmers not to bring the produce directly from their fields to the DPC and stock them at their houses/own godowns for inspection and issuance of tokens by the Corporation staff was unacceptable since individual farmers lack proper facilities to store the grains. The grains get drenched in rain or spoiled due to vagaries of nature which could not be avoided, he pointed out.

Further, only 600 to 700 bags of paddy are being procured per day at a DPC though the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation has to “instruct” the staff to step up the daily procurement to around 1000 gunny bags. Hence, there is a delay in the procurement process at the DPCs, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/farmers-call-for-prompt-procurement/article32759867.ece
338,2020/10/03,Manchester United needs to win,"No more moaning: Spurs’ Mourinho

Manchester United needs a response on the pitch when Jose Mourinho returns to Old Trafford as Tottenham manager on Sunday to calm the unease of supporters frustrated by a lack of movement in the transfer market.

Dutch international midfielder Donny Van de Beek is the only player United has signed in the transfer window so far with Monday’s deadline leaving precious little time for more deals to be concluded.

The outcry for new players has not been quietened by United’s poor start to the Premier League season.

A 3-1 home defeat by Crystal Palace dampened optimism of a title challenge this season before it escaped a 3-2 victor at Brighton last weekend after the host hit the woodwork five times.

Failure to beat a Spurs side playing its fourth game in eight days this weekend will have alarm bells ringing that United risks going backwards this season.

Mourinho, meanwhile, has said he has already moaned enough about the club’s packed fixture list and will not use it as an excuse against United Sunday.

Eric Dier, Toby Alderweireld and Steven Bergwijn have all started twice in 48 hours this week, while United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fielded a much-changed lineup for Wednesday’s League Cup victory at Brighton.

“It’s the last one, the last match,” he told a news conference on Friday. “I don’t want to moan. I moaned enough and I moaned with real things on my hands and I don’t think anyone disagreed with me, even when I was moaning about the situation.”

Ben Chilwell scored his first Chelsea goal as the defender’s dynamic display on his Premier League debut for the Blues inspired a 4-0 thrashing of Crystal Palace on Saturday.

Later Dominic Calvert-Lewin became Everton’s first player to score in the opening four matches of a Premier League season as it beat Brighton 4-2 on Saturday to keep its perfect start intact.

The result left Everton top of the standings on a maximum 12 points from four games.

Stubborn defence

It was Chilwell efforts that broke down Palace’s stubborn defence at Stamford Bridge.

Chilwell’s thumping finish put Chelsea ahead soon after half-time and he provided the assist for Kurt Zouma’s header as the Blues doubled their lead.

Jorginho added a pair of late penalties for Chelsea to complete the rout, although the second caused some angst for Tammy Abraham as the Blues striker argued with Cesar Azpilicueta about who should take it before losing the heated debate with his captain.

The results:

Premier League: Chelsea 4 (Chilwell 50, Zouma 66, Jorginho 78-pen, 82-pen) bt Crystal Palace 0; Everton 4 (Calvert-Lewin 16, Mina 45+2, Rodriguez 52, 70) bt Brighton 2 (Maupay 41, Bissouma 90).

After demolishing the boundary wall, the GVMC officials arranged a fencing and said that around 10-feet of the space inside the house premises belongs to the corporation.

Large number of workers, around 30 policemen along with the Town Planning department of GVMC started the demolition activity from 4.30 a.m. on Saturday. It was learnt that the toilet which was demolished by the GVMC was constructed for the workers in the house of Mr Hari.

Speaking to the media, Mr Sabbam Hari said that he did not receive any notice from the GVMC. It was around 4.30 a.m. when my workers woke me up and said that the boundary wall is being demolished. When I questioned the GVMC officials, they did not show any notice, but claimed that they have received orders from senior officers, he said.

“As I am questioning Mr Jagan Mohan Reddy’s rule and its failures, they have targeted me. This is how the government is functioning in this state.

342,2020/10/03,Hari’s arrest a big blow to Maoists in Galikonda,"He was entrusted with reviving movement after many setbacks

The Visakhapatnam district police has struck a big blow for the CPI (Maoist) in the Galikonda region, with the arrest of Gemmeli Kamesh alias Hari, on Wednesday.

The arrested Maoist was not only involved in over 100 serious offences, including five murders and seven exchanges of fire, but was playing a key role in revival of the Maoist movement in Galikonda area of Visakhapatnam agency.

Being an area committee member (ACM), he was leading the Galikonda dalam in some pockets, under the supervision of Jagan, who is the divisional committee member (DCM).

Apart from being a local, a resident of Kumkumapudi in GK Veedhi mandal, he is the nephew of slain Maoist leader Gemmeli Narayan Rao alias Jambri.

This strategically was working in his favour, especially after the death of Jambri and Azad and the surrender of Boda Anjayya alias Bhaskar alias Naveen in 2019.

Leadership crisis

Galikonda area that comprises mandals such as Chintapalli, GK Veedhi and parts of Koyyuru, has always been a Maoist hotbed, but it suffered a void after the death of Jambri and Azad and surrender of Naveen, within a short span.

Gopal alias Azad was killed in an alleged exchange of fire with the security forces in May 2016 in Marripakala in Koyyuru mandal. Azad was then the DCM and leading the movement. His successor Jambri was also killed in an alleged encounter in February 2017 near Annavaram village under Mampa police limits in Koyyuru. Following this, Naveen was elevated as DCM but he surrendered within a year in 2019.

Close on the heels, about 12 Maoists and militia members surrendered, in a setback for the Maoist movement in Galikonda.

“With the arrest of Hari, we have once again created the void and we will now pursue to see that others also surrender,” said DIG (Visakha range) L.K.V. Ranga Rao.

At present, Jagan is the only surviving senior leader in the area and it is estimated that there are 12 to 15 Maoist cadres, who are supported by about 200 militia members, including a few armed militias.

According to Superintendent of Police, Visakhapatnam, B. Krishna Rao, Galikonda area has always been a stronghold of the Maoist. “The terrain is difficult and the forest is thick, which provides them a good cover. But the series of deaths and surrenders have created a void and Hari was entrusted the job of reviving it,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/pfcd79/article32757351.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03-VJ-MAOISTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/haris-arrest-a-big-blow-to-maoists-in-galikonda/article32757352.ece

349,2020/10/03,What Enthoven knew: R.E. Enthoven’s ‘The Tribes and Castes of Bombay’,"The ethnographic data provided by ‘The Tribes and Castes of Bombay’ in the 1920s still hold water

The work we will look at today is a classic although it was written a little over a century ago. It is R.E. Enthoven’s The Tribes and Castes of Bombay, published in three volumes and still in print. A recent incident reminded me strongly of this book — I will come to that presently.

Reginald Edward Enthoven was born in 1869 (the same year Mahatma Gandhi was born and Ghalib died), studied at Oxford, and came to India as a civil service officer at the age of 20. Stationed in Bombay, he worked on the census, among other things. He made several contributions to the Gazetteer, a periodical through which the British mapped and understood India, its physical features and communities. The black leather-bound volumes on Bombay make for wonderful reading.

500 communities

Indian communities clearly interested Enthoven. The first one he describes in Volume II is that of oil-pressers in Gujarat who claimed mercantile descent though they were likely an occupational caste who broke off from the peasantry. Enthoven describes their family lives and rules of marriage. A man was allowed to marry his wife’s sister after the wife’s death; a widow could remarry her dead husband’s brother, but not the eldest one. Polygamy was also allowed if the earlier wife was provided for. Enthoven documents marriage rituals and related gods, inheritance laws and death rituals. Naturally, he also explains how their hereditary profession is carried out. He ends by noting that “they eat the flesh of goats, sheep, fowls and fish, and drink liquor”. The whole thing takes up two pages.

In this fashion, Enthoven documented 500 communities in all. At first, this effort likely fit in with what the government was trying to achieve through the census and other such documentation. But government funding for the community by community and caste by caste survey was stopped in 1909, according to a note published by the Royal Asiatic Society in 1924. It was left to Enthoven to use his own resources to complete the work. Enthusiasts working on similar projects pitched in (G.H. Desai compiled a glossary of castes, tribes, and races in Baroda State in 1912).

The three volumes of The Tribes and Castes of Bombay were published in 1920 and their contents have since then been widely used, including by the ‘The People of India’ series, which is a very large ethnographic survey of all of India started by the British in 1868 and taken up by the government in 1992. ‘The People of India’ survey uses Enthoven’s format, which is informative and easy to read.

Happy ending

Now to turn to the personal event referred to earlier. Recently, I had to attend the hearing for a complaint filed by a ruling party legislator who took offence to something I wrote about his leader’s community. What I wrote was anodyne and factual: the offence probably stemmed from ignorance.

But since it was registered as a criminal case, I had to defend myself by producing evidence. Here, I used a note published by the National Commission for Backward Classes, which was formed to introduce relevant communities into the list of Other Backward Classes (this is done State by State after ethnographically identifying the socio-economically backward sub-castes).

The note referred to the fact that the Muslim members of a particular caste had been given reservations as OBCs but not the Hindu members, though they shared the same caste occupation, even the name. In the mid-90s, the Hindus submitted a petition for inclusion: a senior Central government bureaucrat looked at the evidence and concluded that Hindus and Muslims from this caste were indeed one community. The Hindu caste, he wrote, should be treated as a synonym for the Muslim one.

The evidence the bureaucrat cited was from Enthoven’s Tribes and Castes of Bombay. The story ended happily for the Hindus, who were included in the Mandal list as OBCs and got reservations. I do not know if my own story will have a happy ending too, as the case continues, but it promises to be interesting.

350,2020/10/03,The world never goes away: Review of ‘The Heart Asks Pleasure First’ by Ranjana Sengupta,"A remarkable if not flawless debut, bravely tackling grand questions of history, love, loyalty and faith

That the Partition with its attendant wounds could, more than half a century later, impact the fates of two young lovers in a small coastal town in Wales, seems unlikely, if not far-fetched. But Karuna Ezara Parikh’s accomplished debut novel, The Heart Asks Pleasure First, fashions an all-too-plausible scenario where this, in fact, could happen.

Aaftab, a law student from an affluent but orthodox Islamabad background meets Daya, an aspiring dancer from Lalabad (a thinly disguised Delhi), from the ranks of India’s uber liberal intelligentsia, with parents who proudly wear their secular credentials on their sleeve. Daya, who has come to study ballet in this Welsh town, meets Aaftab in a park where he is sitting on a bench reading Anna Karenina. They soon fall in love. But from early on in the relationship, Aaftab has misgivings about its future, having acquired the wisdom of avoiding unwinnable situations through his dealings with his abusive, authoritarian father.

Shades and nuances

His approach to Islam is heavily influenced by the Sufi poets he loves reading, and his religious observances are confined to attending Friday prayers in the local mosque. This is the extent of his contact with the small, tightly knit Muslim community which is increasingly being influenced by the new imam’s radical sermons, finding in them a defence against the casual racism of the townspeople.

From Daya’s perspective, which Parikh evokes with great sympathy, the religious and nationalist differences between herself and

Aaftab, particularly the former, have little relevance. She shares her parents’ liberal humanist belief that it is irrational to hate an entire country or community. One can hate an individual, according to this worldview, but not a nation or religion. The action takes place in the early 2000s: therefore 9/11 as well as the attack on India’s Parliament happen in the course of the narrative. While the former event impels Aaftab to examine what his Muslim identity means to him, Daya, in the wake of the Parliament attack and subsequent military mobilisation, is forced to consider her feelings of outrage, but finds they have little bearing on her feelings for Aaftab.

Wasim, Aaftab’s roommate, represents the alternative third position. This lower-middle class boy from Rawalpindi is a non-Westernised counterpoint to Daya’s secular liberalism and Aaftab’s Sufi-influenced Islam. Wasim comes across as grounded and loyal, a friend to both Daya and Aaftab, but from his viewpoint their relationship is impossible — even though they conceal the extent of their involvement from him.

He is a devout and practising Muslim, but refuses to have any truck with the fundamentalists; he is a devoted son and brother but allows his family to think he’s studying medicine and not the considerably less prestigious physical education. In Parikh’s telling, he has shades and nuances — more multi-dimensional in contrast to Aaftab’s relentless self-examination and Daya’s blithe unquestioning acceptance of her parents’ virtues and values.

Haunting language

Matters come to a head when Daya has to rush home because of her father’s serious illness while the imam mounts a campaign against Aaftab for his relationship with a non-Muslim. The denouement is swift and brutal but with a small sliver of hope left at the end.

Parikh’s story explores a space where these two earnest young lovers come together trying to discover if it is possible to find a personal truth which is unaffected by the impersonal forces swirling outside their bubble — the forces of history, politics and old hatreds. But they find — as did others from Paris and Helen to Anna Karenina to the victims of so-called ‘honour’ killings — that complete insulation is not possible; that the world never goes away and always punishes what it sees as transgressions. The universe Parikh creates, that of a small diaspora in the small quiet town of Cardiff, with its tight sense of inclusion and exclusion, its codes and punishments, has been explored before — Maps for Lost Lovers by Nadeem Aslam comes to mind.

Her language is fluid and haunting and the writing is remarkable for its gentleness. But there are some drawbacks: Daya and Aaftab are somewhat one-dimensional figures and their parents — whether Aaftab’s violent and intractable father or Daya’s parents with their undiluted goodness — sometimes feel like caricatures. Besides, the long, dense expositions of political or historical background (Akbar’s Navratnas, Osama bin Laden’s antecedents, and so on) are not knitted into the story but interrupt the narrative annoyingly.

But these are minor cavils. Taken as a whole, The Heart Asks Pleasure First is a remarkable debut that bravely tackles some grand, tough questions about how the past bleeds into the present, and about the role of love, loyalty, history and faith.

351,2020/10/03,The many conversations with truth: M.K. Gandhi as a writer,"Gandhi was one of the most prolific writers of all times. What did writing mean to him?

If M.K. Gandhi’s writings matter to us today, the writer in him should matter more, especially for humanist scholars. He is one of the most prolific writers of all times, having provided enough material for the nearly hundred-volume Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi, besides numerous rough drafts and unpublished material.

How did Gandhi manage to write so much despite his hectic schedule? Since writing is a public act performed privately, what did writing mean to Gandhi — the public personality and the private self? Why did he write at all?

In examining Gandhi’s writerly self, I would like to focus on two of his classics, Hind Swaraj and his autobiography,The Story of My Experiments with Truth. Gandhi’s involvement with print culture — journalism, editing, publishing, translating and authoring books — invites one more biography. His direct and simple prose devoid of artificiality was honed over the years, chiefly through his reading of the Bible and the English authors. His experience of drafting documents constantly for the Congress might have shaped his art of composition too. Besides, he was an obsessive letter-writer, penning thousands of epistles in his lifetime.

No rights reserved

Gandhi wrote Hind Swaraj in Gujarati in 1909, aboard a steamer, when he was on the way to South Africa from England. In their critical edition of Hind Swaraj, Suresh Sharma and Tridip Suhrud reconstruct the history of its composition. The pull of writing was so overwhelming that Gandhi used his left hand when the right got tired. The journey had been preceded by an intense period of thinking, reading and discussion on the issues he dealt with in Hind Swaraj. The steamer, like prison, provided an enabling space to reflect and write.

As Gandhi explains in the foreword, he wrote Hind Swaraj because he could not restrain himself after having read and pondered much. He says that the views expressed in the book are not his because they were formed after reading several books. In the appendix he gives a list of books that influenced him. Gandhi conceived of his writing as bricolage, an assemblage of different modes of thought. He weaved in the ideas of Plato, Tolstoy, Ruskin, Thoreau, Edward Carpenter, Dadabhai Naoroji, and many others, in Hind Swaraj.

Thus Gandhi not only negated the idea of the author at the centre of the production of meaning, he also practised inter-textuality, predating the poststructuralist theory of the death of the author. He had a pre-modern and pre-capitalist understanding of the writing self and text — for him, they were not sites of intellectual property. He renounced the text by declaring in the title page of the first English edition of Hind Swaraj, ‘No Rights Reserved’.

If Gandhi conceived of himself as a weaver of different thoughts in Hind Swaraj, he was up to a different adventure in his autobiography. The critical edition of My Experiments with Truth by Suhrud gives us several clues to what writing meant for Gandhi. According to Suhrud, Gandhi experimented with all kinds of things, including food, clothing and body. Likewise, writing for him was a field of experiments with different practices of the self.

Writing, especially the autobiography, was also a matrix of self-discipline. When he found himself stalled, he framed a programme, devoting six hours a day to literary studies as part of his writing exercise.

Still small voice

If he wrote Hind Swaraj in the solitary space of the steamer, he penned most of his autobiography in the social environs of the ashram. Originally written in Gujarati, it came out in 166 instalments in Gandhi’s journal, Navajivan, between 1925 and 1929. When he began, he had no definite plan, no diary or documents on which to base the story. He says, “I write just as the Spirit moves me at the time of writing.” As if as a counterpoint to the polyphony of Hind Swaraj, it is the antarayami (a Gujarati word translated as ‘Spirit’ in English), the inner voice, that speaks in My Experiments.

Gandhi was not following fashionable Western practices in writing his autobiography. For him, his life consisted of nothing but his experiments with truth and he wanted to tell that story. He made a clear distinction between atmakatha (the story of a self) and jivan vrutant (the chronicle of life). What he attempted was atmakatha — the autobiography as a space for having a conversation with oneself, a site for self-exploration.

Suhrud observes that Gandhi could have written it only in Gujarati, the language in which he communicated with the self and also the language in which he heard the ‘still small voice’ speaking from within. He stopped writing it the moment he thought the latter part of his life was already in the public sphere.

Writing for Gandhi was thus both a personal conversation with the self and a social act of communication with the reader outside. And it was through this ethical engagement with the self and the world that he conveyed the principles that he practised all his life.

John Stratton Hawley’s book on the present and future of Vrindavan is like a documentary on a real and imagined place, “focused on the Vrindavan of myth and glory.” Is the Vrindavan of unending ras lilas, musical plays on the life of Krishna, giving way to another “wilderness”, of the concrete jungle kind?

A sense of foreboding

There is a sense of foreboding as one turns the pages of this systematic exploration of Vrindavan as a place that unfolds on the multidimensional map of a virtual future. A sense of the unreal grips us, a sense of total loss too, of being swept away by forces beyond the control of the individual and even the community, region, country and all the things that we hold dear and are able to recognise as real.

In fact, this is a book that one cannot easily put away. What the future holds for this once tiny hamlet on the banks of the Yamuna where Krishna is supposed to have played with his gopis — a place that is not too far from Delhi and Agra – is what Hawley sets out to explore. Vrindavan is in many ways the opposite of Mathura, that ancient and archetypal city of temples. “Mathura symbolises city: Vrindavan symbolises forest.”

Vrindavan is both van (forest) and gram (village). Vrinda means tulsi, the sacred basil. This van that is the forest which is Krishna’s abode is currently undergoing a tremendous transformation. Huge highways, mega dams and high-rise buildings are turning this mythic place into another Disneyland. It might be that this is the ultimate destiny of this village, as we come to recognise from the picture that unfolds in the pages.

Old and new

And yet, Krishna’s playground is not just another paradise lost, it is also a paradise regained. As globalisation and economics liberally alter the face of all reality there is a significant change in the manner in which we perceive that reality too. The eight chapters of this book take the reader on a dizzying roller coaster ride: here you will come across highways and supermalls, a massive sky-touching temple, the Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir, is being built and corporate giants are vying with each other to get a foothold in the lord’s own playground.

The new Vrindavan mocks the old Vrindavan ‘s longstanding sense of wilderness as home by covering it with an ideology of moneyed leisure. Hawley writes that “What we see in Vrindavan today is a new tectonic plate crashing into the old. Vrindavan stands at a special juncture, with Uttar Pradesh on one side and Delhi on the other. Uttar Pradesh — India’s poorest, most populous region — shows what happens when an ancient fertile plain can no longer support the life that once thrived there: Delhi exhibits the horrors of a galloping global urbanisation.”

Krishna’s dalliances with the gopis might have been seen as part of the moral blight by colonial reformers and there have been several “corrective” endeavours from Indian intellectuals to show that Krishna was not a ladies’ man but rational, intellectual and practical. And as Hawley shows such flexing of masculinist muscles and the great desire to build a plush monument in his honour has brought Vrindavan to the brink of extinction. It warns us that our known world has exploded. Our actions have consequences and they are often not the consequences we wish. Krishna’s Playground is an admonition for all those who stand for total control.

353,2020/10/03,‘Caste: The Lies That Divide Us’ review: Casting a long shadow,"With devastating evidence, some from her own life, Isabel Wilkerson links the race-based caste pyramid of America to two other powerful systems, that of Nazi Germany and India

The long hand of caste touches every aspect of Indian life, politics, culture, society, history. Suraj Yengde begins his recent book, Caste Matters, by saying “I am forced to live in the world as though I am secondary, and the Brahmin and his universality are primary.” Two other writers Sujatha Gidla (Ants among Elephants) and Yashica Dutt (Coming out as Dalit) have recalled the inhumanity endured by the dispossessed, the malady of caste and “the invisible arm that turns the gears in nearly every system in our country.” Now, an American journalist and writer Isabel Wilkerson seeks to understand the “race-based caste pyramid” in her own country by linking it to two other caste systems, that of Nazi Germany and India.

Stigma of inferiority

In Caste, a painful exploration of what human beings are capable of doing to each other, Wilkerson writes that “each version relied on stigmatizing those deemed inferior to justify the dehumanization necessary to keep the lowest-ranked people at the bottom.” A caste system is an artificial construction, she points out. It is “a fixed and embedded ranking of human value that sets the presumed supremacy of one group against the presumed inferiority of other groups.”

With devastating anecdotal evidence, some from her own life, years of research, reading the works of Gunnar Myrdal, Allison Davis, B.R. Ambedkar et al, and interviews across continents, Wilkerson reaches the conclusion that the hierarchy of caste is about power — which groups have it and which do not. In America, she says, caste is the bones, race the skin.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

In India too, caste is the powerful infrastructure that holds each group in its place. Even for those who shatter these manufactured divisions, it is never an easy transition. She quotes Ambedkar, who worked his whole life for the ‘annihilation of caste’, to argue why the divide is so well-entrenched: “Caste is a notion; it is a state of mind.” Ambedkar, who she once called the Martin Luther King of India to make him relatable to a fellow American, had written to sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois that there is a lot of “similarity between the position of untouchables in India and the position of Negroes in America.”

Caste and its ‘eight pillars’ which includes religious sanction, be it in the U.S. or India, hold everyone captive, according to Wilkerson. It forces a black woman to pretend she is not the owner of the house she lives in. It makes a Dalit scholar feel inadequate to face upper caste people. It lets people live in fear. She tells disturbing stories — of a black boy drowned in front of his father; about lynchings, and lynching postcards with photographs of the killings which were apparently a common form of communication in the turn of 20th century America; of huge inequities and other instances of everyday humiliation like being made a scapegoat for all societal ills from drugs, stagnant jobs to crime. Some of her accounts could be taken off headlines in India.

Towards a resolution

But her book is not just a chronicle of insults. The Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and writer of the highly-acclaimed The Warmth of Other Suns casts a light onto the history of caste and its consequences “to express hopes for its resolution.” Humans can break free of the hierarchy’s hold on them, she writes. But while Germany had atoned for its Nazi past — all memorials in that country are for victims not aggressors — and South Africa set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission after the end of apartheid, Wilkerson emphasises that America has a lot to do to bridge the gap.

She writes of the visit of Martin Luther King Jr and his wife to India in 1959. The civil rights leader wanted to see the land of Mahatma Gandhi whose fight for freedom from British rule had inspired his fight for justice for his people. The oldest democracy and the largest democracy have since abolished legal discrimination and yet Dalits are “brutalized” as are African-Americans.

In an American election year, her observations on the Obama and Trump presidencies are chilling reminders of the deep prevailing chasm. When Trump won in 2016, she heard many progressives saying how could so many people (read whites) vote against their own interests? Wilkerson contends that they voted that way because it was in their interest — they wanted to maintain the caste system as it had always been.

Some may argue that linking race relations in America to Nazi atrocities and the Indian caste system is tenuous but she strongly argues her case with a powerful document that holds lessons for aggressors and their victims all over the world.

354,2020/10/03,"‘Nanoscale: Society’s Deep Impact on Science, Technology and Innovation in India’ review: Size matters","Understanding what happens when tradition meets technology in science and brings it alive

The term nanotechnology conjures up the image of a lab with electronics and wires, power (electricity) and cutting-edge applications, perhaps even a vision of the minute, but almost never its impact on society, the big science or even traditional medicine. Pankaj Sekhsaria’s book Nanoscale is a great place to begin to unravel the connectedness of disciplines, the impact of this science and how Indian society has given its own twist to the way of approaching the nanoscale.

The term nanoscale as used in this book can be somewhat approximately defined as the range of size from one nanometre to 100 nanometres. While a carbon atom would be a tenth of a nanometre, a virus can be about 100 nanometres in size. Within these two orders of magnitude lies a world of science that is brought alive in the book.

Integrating society

The author has taken up work being carried out in four labs to illustrate the extent to which this science has integrated with the needs and dictates of Indian society. The first one is the development of the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope at the physics lab of the University of Pune – a process that exemplifies sustained hard work as it does quirky jugaad tactics. Not stopping with a description of the development of this important scientific tool, the book also explores subsidiary concerns such as the absence of a culture of commercialising such systems and processes.

Who would have thought that gold, in the nanoscale, appears red or blue but not its familiar glowing shade of yellow? The book offers interesting tidbits such as this, even while tackling involved arguments. In Chapter 3, “Ancient Ayurveda, New Nanotechnology,” the story moves on to the Centre for Nanobiosciences, at the Agharkar Research Institute, also in Pune. From the nuts and bolts approach of the physics department, the reader is transported to a study of molecules, gold bhasma and Ayurveda. Here we have people trained in modern scientific method studying and characterising medicinal products traditionally used in Ayurveda. What could follow when Charaka meets modern medicine, but a discussion of hierarchies, method, philosophy and world views. A short but interesting flavour of this is provided in the book.

Technology at the nanoscale can also impact society, it is not merely a subject confined to the labs or is fuelled into business, yes the reader does suspect that, and the book proceeds to elucidate this in an engaging manner.

Low-cost projects

The scene of action shifts to Hyderabad where, at the International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials, a low-cost, drinking water purifier system is being developed. At this centre, mainly focussed on high-tech industrial and defence, mostly high-cost, innovations, the nanosilver incorporated ceramic candles for disinfecting drinking water, is a promising low-cost project. However, the process of trying to commercialise it has been a failure.

The final tale is also set in Hyderabad, where at the LV Prasad Eye Institute, nanotechnology is used to treat retinoblastoma, the most common malignant eye tumour in infants in India.

This is a narrative of Indian science that brings out how it interacts with society. Often the results are new, unexpected even, but never dull.

355,2020/10/03,‘Singing Gandhi’s India: Music and Sonic Nationalism’ review: How Gandhi adopted music on the way to freedom,"A historian points out the Mahatma saw morning prayers as a way to inspire discipline and that he used community voices to mobilise people

By the time Mahatma Gandhi returned to India from South Africa and became active in the independence struggle, there was already a wave of music nationalism being championed by the likes of Vishnu Paluskar, V.N. Bhatkhande and Subramania Bharati; traditional musical practices were being relocated from palace courts to the public arena. Soon after his arrival in India, realising its potential to bring people together, Gandhi adopted music as one of the instruments to mobilise the masses for the cause of swaraj.

In Singing Gandhi’s India, historian Lakshmi Subramanian examines Gandhi’s relationship with music through his letters, significant events and other documents.

Leaning on bhajans

Subramanian begins by introducing the reader to the early nationalisation project aimed at collating and creating a new ‘classical’ tradition of Indian music: Hindustani classical in the north and Carnatic in the south. This reform project, however, led to the exclusion of the communities of the traditional practitioners such as the Devadasis in the south and the Ustads and Tawaifs in the north. Interestingly, according to Subramanian, Gandhi did not engage with this reform project; he felt the classical form of music demanded an intimate knowledge of technique. For Gandhi, music — whether it was a bhajan like Vaishnava Janato or a patriotic song like Vande Mataram — was a means of development of the “moral self” which was essential to become a satyagrahi. Subramanian writes that Gandhi saw the morning prayers as a way to inspire personal discipline and community singing as a means of mobilising people.

The book traces Gandhi’s relationship with music from the early days of the Sabarmati Ashram till the time of Independence. But Subramanian does not follow a chronological approach which can be confusing for a reader trying to understand the evolution of this complicated relationship.

However, the historian engages the reader by revealing the difficulties in interpreting the vast and frequently contradicting writings of Gandhi. In one instance, she writes about resisting the “temptation to speculate on the gendered dimensions” of Gandhi’s forthright instructions to women followers via his correspondence with Saraladebi Chaudhurani.

Moral lessons

She also examines Gandhi’s reflections — amounting to dismissing the requirement of public performance of religious songs to assert devotion to a religion — on the communal conflicts created by the singing of devotional songs at prayer times in front of mosques in the 1920s and his subsequent endorsement of the public performance of prabhat pheris (morning musical processions) in the 1930s as a political act.

It is fascinating to read how Gandhi remained committed to his idea of music as an important device to build a moral society despite several hurdles such as the opposition to the invocation of Lord Rama in the Ramdhun (Gandhi responded by saying Ram is universal and belongs to all religions) and the Hindu undertones of Vande Mataram.

Despite its uneven structure, the timing of the book helps the reader to delve deep into Gandhi’s use of music as a means of spiritual development and his failure in inspiring the masses to adopt a morally upright lifestyle. It also provokes the reader on contemplating how Gandhi who “admitted it was not possible to have politics without religion” would have reacted to the increasingly intertwined discourse of religion and nation in the country.

356,2020/10/03,This is Híristor’s story,"He was the largest tusker in the area and collected his own entourage of younger bulls

Híristor is not a fantastical being out of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth, but a real-life giant of flesh and blood.

The elephant’s name means ‘knowledgeable leader’ in the Elvish language, which Nishant Srinivasaiah favours for naming his research subjects. He felt people would be quick to judge or project their own biases on elephants if he gave them names like Raja, Ganesa, and Rowdy. “We name them for a reason, but then even we forget after a while,” says the researcher. “It helps us be unbiased.”

Ten years ago, when Srinivasaiah first caught sight of Híristor, the young bull along with others of similar age were understudies of an older male elephant. These wild giants, every one of them a bull, didn’t live in jungles only but made forays into the agricultural areas of Tumakuru, northwest of Bengaluru, weaving their way through residential alleys, crossing highways, and climbing over fences.

An irrigation project channelled water year-round to grow crops, and the ripening fields attracted elephants. The constant battles with farmers could create hostile living conditions for the animals. However, eating cultivated cereals for dinner and being chased by humans are a normal part of their daily routine, says Srinivasaiah.

Híristor was probably born 100 kilometres away in Bannerghatta National Park on the southern edge of Bengaluru. When he came of age and had to leave his mother’s herd, he probably followed a visiting bull into these lands, a daunting place for new entrants. How to avoid falling into concrete canals and breaking his legs? How to deal with an irate farmer? He could have learned by trial and error, a perilous choice. But he chose the less risky option of sticking close to an older, experienced bull.

Cool and casual

When Híristor grew independent of his mentor, he was the largest tusker in the area and collected his own entourage of younger bulls. They followed him into fields at night and feasted on ears of grain without alerting half-asleep farmers. The flunkies watched Híristor unlatch gates, look to the right when crossing roads, and being unafraid of camera traps that Srinivasaiah had affixed on their path.

Although bulls like Híristor bulk up on crops and reach their prime faster than forest-living elephants, their lives are rife with danger. They could be electrocuted by illegally electrified fences or run over by trucks or trains. When Híristor came into musth, he padded his solitary way south to find mates in the forest where he was born. While he was away, his understudies lived by the skills they had learnt from him, reuniting with him on his return. “They greeted each other with elaborate rituals until now documented among female elephants and their kin only,” says Srinivasaiah.

The role of experienced males such as Híristor in bull elephant society has been underestimated, says the researcher. “These are millennial elephants, explorers pushing the boundaries as far as they can.” Under their wise and calm tutelage, younger animals learn to keep their cool even if they are fearful. Without the older bulls’ stabilising influence, the brash inexperienced ones lash out aggressively at humans protecting their crops.

None like him!

But Híristor’s calm demeanour was also his downfall. Since he had a finely tuned ability to read human body language, he watched people in daylight instead of running away. To farmers who had faced one too many nightly elephantine visits, he symbolised the fearless marauder of their livelihoods.

When complaints about elephant damage to crops compelled forest officials to act, they trapped him. None of the younger bulls in his group took his mantle, and they went their separate ways. Neither did his capture solve farmers’ problems. With high-strung giants dispersed across the countryside, the nightmare of protecting crops from them afflicted many more households. Several months later, the tusker died a captive.

The larger-than-life elephant lived up to his name so well, the researcher cannot forget him or why he named the wise giant, Híristor.

357,2020/10/03,"Flowers today, haute couture tomorrow","Phool.co repurposes discarded flowers to extract a vegan leather-like material called Fleather

Ankit Agarwal, co-founder of Phool.co, is a busy man. Right now he is occupied with petals and puppies. The former is his business and the latter, he found under his desk in IIT (Kanpur), where he currently works out of. IIT is a stakeholder in the company that he launched with Prateek Kumar in 2018.

Phool.co started off with making incense sticks out of re-purposed flowers. These flowers are collected from the Ganges and various places of worship. This initiative was a means to stop pollution caused by emptying of floral waste into water bodies.

“I never thought of temple waste as pollution,” says Ankit. Every day, a vehicle belonging to Phool.co goes around sourcing flowers. Pre-COVID-19, they were collecting around eight tonnes in a day and now the number has reduced to around two-and-a-half to three tonnes, say sources from the company. Once acquired, they are dried to get rid of the water. Of late, Phool.co has also been gathering flowers from events like weddings. They get a lot of marigold, hibiscus, jasmine, tulsi leaves, roses and sometimes exotic plants too.

Innovating

“India has eight lakh tonnes of flowers being dumped every year. We realised making incense sticks alone wouldn’t solve the problem and we needed to create something else with it, that would be a B2B product.” That is how the idea of Fleather (leather-like material made from flowers) came about. The company has already experimented with the material by making bags and upholstery out of it.

It took a year and a half to get this material right. Pleased with their handiwork, the 10-member team at Phool.co now wants to put India on the world map of fashion, with their vegan leather. “Earlier this year, we showcased Fleather at Lakme Fashion Week, where we were awarded PETA’s Best Innovation in the Vegan World,” says Ankit.

Currently the company is making 1,200 square feet of Fleather everyday. It is being made in batches of two-by-two feet which uses up around 400 grams of flower. The entire process takes 13 days. “You can get it in any colour or print you want. We have already got enquiries from European fashion brands,” he says.

Ankit says you can not find any difference between their product and leather. It has the same touch, feel and tensile strength; all at three-fourth the cost of leather, he says. The company is adding another stream of waste: farm stubble that will be converted into Fleather and eventually into bags, shoes and outfits.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/as6mm5/article32759436.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05mpphool3,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/from-flower-to-leather/article32759437.ece
358,2020/10/03,Century-old data help measure the Sun’s magnetic field,"Knowing the magnetic field variations on the Sun can contribute to our understanding of climate and space weather

The magnetic field of the Sun is unique in that, unlike many other celestial bodies, it reverses its polarity roughly every 11 years. Regular observations of the Sun’s magnetic field begin in 1967, and, so far, we have data for the period from 1967 almost to the present, spanning the solar cycles 20-24. Now, an Indo-Russian collaboration has added to this with a plot of the solar magnetic field from 1915 to 1965 (solar cycles 15-19). Using a novel approach, they have calibrated and calculated the field using data from the archives of the Kodaikanal Solar Observatory of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics.

“For about the last 50 years, that is, from around 1970s, regular measurements of magnetic field are available from different observatories. One important one is Wilcox Solar Observatory from the US. Before that Mount Wilson Solar Observatory provided some data, although they are not of high quality and uniform,” says Dipankar Banerjee, Director of Aryabhata Research Institute of Observational Sciences, Nainital, and an author of the paper which has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Data from Kodaikanal

The present study makes the important contribution of building on this using the Kodaikanal Solar observatory data, and extending the magnetic field calculations for another fifty years approximately. “Understanding the magnetic field evolution in the past improves our understanding of the physics itself. In the work we have also talked about the timing of the polarity reversal, which is also very important,” adds Prof. Banerjee. Solar variations, both of long scale and short, depend on the magnetic field, and these can affect both the climate and space weather. Therefore, understanding the magnetic field variations can contribute to our understanding of climate and space weather.

The Kodaikanal Solar Observatory was established in 1899 and observations of the Sun from this observatory run over a hundred years, providing what is among the longest series of solar data. An important feature of these data is the multi-wavelength observations. The data consist of full disc spectral images of the Sun using the Ca II K and H-alpha lines. Both these lines image the atmospheric layer of the Sun known as the chromosphere.

Extracting information

From the full-disc images of Ca II K features, bright patches above magnetic field regions, known as plages are identified. “Underneath these one can find sunspots, so plages provide information about magnetic field locations and strength,” says Bidya Binay Karak, a Ramanujan Fellow at the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, and an author of the paper.

On the other hand, the H-alpha images show filaments, which are formed along magnetic neutral lines. “Their presence also represents the magnetic field distribution beneath. They also allow us to study the evolution of magnetic field with time,” he explains.

Reconstruction

The team first calibrated the Ca IIK images of the Kodaikanal data using magnetic field measurements that were available during that period. Using this, they interpreted the data for the periods when magnetic field measurements were not available, namely, years 1915-1965. “The H-alpha images display the location of filaments, which are believed to be formed along the magnetic neutral lines, so these images provide information on the magnetic polarity,” says Dr Karak. “Combining the two sets, the full magnetic field data was reconstructed.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/vrqaub/article32761678.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04TH-SCISOLARjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/century-old-data-help-measure-the-suns-magnetic-field/article32761679.ece
359,2020/10/03,Rapid antigen tests ideal for screening for coronavirus,"Such tests are quick, cheap and do not rely on labs and expensive equipment

With novel coronavirus cases accelerating or plateauing across the world, the focus should shift from using a test that has high sensitivity to pick even small amounts of the virus, such as the molecular test (RT-PCR), to rapid antigen tests which can detect infections, a Perspective piece published in The New England Journal of Medicine says.

This message has been misconstrued on social media without understanding the context in which the researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, and the University of Colorado, Boulder, have advocated this shift.

Right screening tool

The researchers have focussed on which test to be used as a screening tool in a community or the entire population in the U.S. to quickly identify infected people, including those who are asymptomatic, and isolate such people so as to quickly cut the transmission chain. Rapid antigen tests are not only quick (can return results in 15-30 minutes compared with 24-48 hours for RT-PCR) but also are cheap and do not rely on laboratory and expensive equipment to carry out testing.

But rapid antigen tests have low sensitivity and therefore produce false negative results half the time. It is for this reason that rapid antigen test should be used repeatedly in the same population as part of an overall testing strategy. Frequent testing thus makes up for poor sensitivity. Based on modelling, Daniel Larremore, an applied mathematician at the University of Colorado, Boulder and his colleagues found that testing people every three days and isolating those who test positive could prevent 88% of virus spread.

Testing in India

No State in India has so far been screening whole communities or populations with either rapid antigen tests or RT-PCR to diagnose those who have been infected. Instead, States follow syndromic surveillance where testing is carried out on people who exhibit fever or any of the other COVID-19 symptoms.

Instead of asking States to repeat the tests in those who have a negative result with a rapid antigen test, even in its June 23 advisory, ICMR has asked States to validate all negative results from rapid antigen tests with a RT-PCR.

Authors of the NEJM article, too, make a distinction between tests used on people showing symptoms and for screening a population, and bat for RT-PCR for clinical tests. “Clinical tests are designed for use with symptomatic people, do not need to be low-cost, and require high analytic sensitivity to return a definitive clinical diagnosis given a single opportunity to test,” they write.

Problems with RT-PCR

Using RT-PCR to screen a community or population has several problems. RT-PCR test is expensive compared with a rapid antigen test, making repeated testing on the same individual every few days even more expensive. It takes at least one–two days to test and a couple of days to inform the individuals of the test result.

The slow turnaround time would mean that infected individuals will come in contact with others and spread the virus even while waiting for the test result. Also, it may pick people who have been infected but are no longer infectious. This might be a problem when such people have to be isolated even when they no longer spread the virus.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/dbukgz/article32761580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04TH-SCIANTIGEN-TESTjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/rapid-antigen-tests-ideal-for-screening-for-coronavirus/article32761581.ece
360,2020/10/03,‘Warm COVID-19 vaccine’ that needs no cold chain,"The fragment of the receptor binding domain can be stored for a month at 37 degrees Celsius

Unlike drugs, virtually all vaccines need to be transported at cold temperatures (usually between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius) prior to use. If they are exposed to higher temperatures, many vaccines lose potency. Re-cooling does not help. Thus we need what is called the cold chain of handling before use. It would therefore be extremely useful if we can make and transport a vaccine at room temperature, with no cold chain needed.

Warm vaccine

It is towards such a “warm vaccine” that an Indian group, led by Raghavan Varadarajan of the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru (IISc) and other collaborators at IISER Trivandrum, THSTI Faridabad, and the IISc-incubated startup Mynvax have worked. Their preprint, entitled, “Design of a thermo-tolerant, immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 Spike fragment,” is publicly available in Biorxiv at https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.18.252437.

Active domain

The COVID virus has, on its surface, a protein called the spike which is about 1,300-amino-acids long. Within this, a sequence that is about 250 amino acids long, called the receptor binding domain (RBD), attaches itself to the “host” cell surface and starts the process of infection. The group decided to synthesise in the laboratory, not the full length spike protein, but a 200-amino-acid fragment of the RBD, and study its structure, (three-dimensional architecture, or the shape which allows it to fit snugly to the host cell surface — a “lock and key” fit), thermal stability (can it work at temperatures higher than the normal lab conditions), and so forth. Happily, the authors found that this fragment, when freeze dried (or “lyophilized”), is highly stable, can withstand transient exposure to temperatures as high as 100 degrees Celsius and can be stored for over a month at 37 degrees Celsius, suggesting a cold-chain should not be required for this molecule.

Clues from structure

On an aside, for the past 70 years, India has been a pioneer in the field of how the structure or architecture of a protein offers clues to its function. It still is. For example how the triple helical structure of collagen, experimentally discovered by the late G. N. Ramachandran in 1954, explains why it is found in the skin and tendons, offering them rope-like strength. Prof. Ramachandran also suggested, given a protein sequence, how we may predict the ways it may fold into a 3-dimensional architecture. This, in turn, has led biochemists to synthesise proteins with changes in their amino acid sequence that function the way they want it to.

The authors have done exactly this by carefully choosing the sequence of the RBD fragment to be expressed, and demonstrating that the resulting protein is thermo-tolerant. This exemplifies the power of protein structural analysis and “genetic engineering”.

The RBD protein was produced in large amounts in mammalian cells as well as in a yeast called Pichia pastoris, which is a highly cost-effective, inexpensive, host. However, when they compared the two proteins, they found that the yeast-expressed protein was more heterogeneous and did not yield the desired antibodies when tested in animals. They also tried expressing the identical RBD fragment in the usual model bacterial system, E.coli, but the protein was non-functional.

Adjuvants and trials

Now that we have a thermo-tolerant RBD, can it be tried as a vaccine candidate, generating antibodies that will block the receptor-binding motif of the spike protein and prevent infection? Generally, immunologists add what is called an adjuvant which, when co-injected along with the vaccine material (cells or molecules), stimulates the immune system and enhances the ability of the vaccine to work. Aluminium salts are often used.

The authors chose to use guinea pigs in their initial immunisations, since these are thought to be better models than mice for respiratory illnesses. As adjuvant, they used a generic version of the MF59 adjuvant which has an excellent safety record in humans, and they injected the RBD formulation in guinea pigs. After two doses, tests showed substantial levels of the desired receptor-blocking antibodies in the animals. So, it works.

They point out that numerous other groups have used the entire full length spike protein, or new RNA-based approaches to express antigens, including the RBD. However, unlike all the COVID-19 vaccine formulations currently in clinical trials which require a cold chain, this particular thermo-tolerant RBD fragment, (and possibly other RBD formulations), can be stored at room temperature for extended periods.

The researchers are now testing the ability of the formulation to protect animals from challenge with infectious virus and will simultaneously carry out safety and toxicity assessments prior to testing in human clinical trials. We wish the group all success.

361,2020/10/03,A tale of mangrove migration,"This directly indicates changes in the micro-environment due to anthropogenic activities and climate change

In 2008, Punarbasu Chaudhuri, mangrove ecologist from the University of Calcutta spotted an interesting mangrove plant at the bank of river Hooghly inside Kolkata city. It was quite unusual, as mangroves require a cyclic supply of saline water, and this growth at an upstream zone was remarkable. He then started an investigation on their distribution in the Hooghly estuary, and his recent paper suggests that the mangroves have started moving upstream, growing in less-saline regions.

Redistributing plants

After surveying the banks near Kolkata, he was able to spot a few mangroves belonging to the genus Sonneratia. He says that over the years due to gradual environmental changes and anthropogenic activities, mangroves have started to redistribute. The paper, published in Marine Pollution Bulletin, notes that they have reclaimed even the upper course of the river, which was completely devoid of mangroves before 1995.

His team spent years mapping the distribution of mangroves and associated species using ground surveys and satellite data. They also studied the sediments and water samples along the river banks. “With the rapid growth of Kolkata city, sewage disposal has increased the pollution load in the river waters. Globally, there is also rapid mean sea-level rise. All these factors might have played a role in this upstream migration,” explains Dr. Chaudhuri who is with the University of Calcutta’s Department of Environmental Science.

Associates found

The team saw that between Barrackpore and Birlapur, in a non-saline region, about 239 mature trees and numerous saplings of Sonneratia caseolaris (commonly known as mangrove apple) have grown naturally. They were just four to five years old with fruits and flowers, exhibiting luxuriant growth. The team also found the redistribution of several other mangrove associate trees, shrubs and climbers in that region.

“This is not welcome news. They directly indicate changes in the micro-environment. The rate of sedimentation, quality of the sediment and biogeochemistry of the river has all been affected by elevated anthropogenic activities and global climate change events,” says Somdeep Ghosh, first author of the paper who completed his PhD under the guidance of Dr. Chaudhuri from the University of Calcutta.

Change in ecology

The team emphasised the fact that the construction of Farakka Barrage in 1975 has increased fresh water flow in River Hooghly, thereby causing change in ecology and chemistry of the river.

They also found high chemical oxygen demand in the river because of increased release of harmful chemicals from multiple point and non-point sources. Studies from China have shown that Sonneratia caseolaris grow well in the presence of high chemical oxygen demand of water.

“This shows the potential of Sonneratia caseolaris to act as a bio-indicator of regional environmental changes. The decline in the mangrove area along with this migration may increase the amplitude of coastal hazards such as storm surges, erosion and flooding. More studies are needed to understand in detail this new horizon of mangrove adaptation and dispersion ecology. We are also planning to study more rivers in this region to get a detailed picture of this migration,” adds Dr. Chaudhuri.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/2uge9z/article32761506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04TH-SCIMangroveJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/a-tale-of-mangrove-migration/article32761507.ece
362,2020/10/03,"The lure of ESG mutual fund schemes globally By R Venkatesh, Founder, GuruRam Financial Consultants","The new buzzword in equity markets across globe is ESG investing. The ESG theme, which stands for environmental, social and governance conscious companies, has gained significant interest in the developed markets such as US and Europe. While it is still in the nascent stage in India with only a handful of ESG mutual fund schemes, many asset management companies are queuing up to launch them in the near term.

What are ESG schemes?

ESG schemes look to invest in companies that meet high environmental, social and governance standards. Even in their daily business operations, these companies show a relatively high degree of responsibility towards all stakeholders- employees, suppliers, dealers or anyone connected with the company’s activities. The managements of such companies are empathic to the environment and are mindful of ethical business practices. Typically, such companies transcend boundaries of mere robust profit growth to self-imposed ethical standards in business operations.

The concept has evolved over time but finds mention in the late 20 century. To give a few examples, investors excluded companies that were manufacturing tobacco from their portfolio. In the 1990s, John Elkington, co-founder of the business consultancy SustainAbility spoke about ESC (environment, social and corporate governance). He indicated that one must look at the “triple bottom line,” which refers to statement of results in three areas profit, people, and the planet.

Why invest in ESG companies?

Market veterans believe that ESG firms show tremendous resilience through highs and lows of economic cycles, thereby leading to sustainable growth. They display relatively low volatility in business due to lower incidence of mishaps and accidents, controversies and enjoy greater loyalty from customers, employees and may be conscious of the need to conserve capital. This could prove beneficial to long term equity investors.

ESG investing is based on the premise that as large retail investors invest in such companies, it would support stock valuations. Indirectly, it would nudge the corporate world to act responsibly from a social, environmental and governance perspective.

Factors such as climate change, shifts in societal preferences and governance issues do pose risks to corporate earnings and thus to investors in stock markets. Companies that are aligned with ESG norms usually have lower risk of losses due to these factors. Thus, investing in firms with a high ESG score could translate into enhanced value for investors in the long run.

Are there enough ESG compliant companies?

Media reports suggest that there has been a surge in sustainable investing in the US and Europe since the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic. At the end of the second quarter 2020, investors have poured nearly $250 billion in the US, which represents 20% of the total market. In Europe, the size of assets into such sustainable investing schemes is thrice that of the US. As per Morningstar Direct, the number of ESG schemes rose from 1168 in 2009 to 3054 in 2019.

The trend is gaining momentum in India too. Both the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange have ESG index funds, which have after due diligence categorised companies under this theme. These indices would help benchmark mutual funds and structured products.

Of course, investors must note that companies in this category mostly under large-cap category with strong business practices and environmental compliance. For instance, ESG schemes would omit tobacco major such as ITC Ltd, but include a host of front line pharma and banking companies Dr Reddy’s Ltd, Housing Development Company Ltd, Larsen and Toubro Ltd, Infosys Ltd and Axis Bank among others. Note that these companies have actually contributed to the national and social cause during the pandemic by either allocating financial resources, manufacturing health care products or by offering facilities for Covid-19 care.

In fact, the ESG philosophy is gaining appeal among young investors who are conscious of the need to preserve environment and adopt transparency in business practices. Even the number of ESG conscious firms are growing as investors, regulators and stakeholders are demanding accountability not just on profits, but governance and social compliance.

Do they offer better returns to investors?

Mutual fund ESG schemes have been allocating resources to companies that have been embracing the philosophy consistently over several years. They usually toe the line of benchmark indices with a marginal outperformance at times. What’s important is that they are resilient during times of crisis times and typically tend to bounce back soon.

Further, analysts of ESG investing eliminates risk to returns from malpractices such as audit queries or lack of environmental compliance in case of starting new factories or sheer tweaking to manufacturing practices to circumvent rules of business. As a result of these filtration practices, the earnings tend to be sustainable over long periods of time.

For a layman, it is very difficult to keep track of these factors of all the companies listed in India. One can overcome these limitations by investing in an ESG Fund offered by mutual fund houses. Currently there are three schemes in this space - Quantum India ESG Equity Fund, SBI Magnum Equity ESG Fund, Axis ESG Equity Fund and very soon ICICI Prudential too is launching an ESG Fund. The New Fund Offer period for this offering is from September 21, 2020 to October 5, 2020.
