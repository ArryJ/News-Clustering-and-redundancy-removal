0,2020/10/26,Road caves in near Central Railway Station,"A truck trailer heavily laden with iron bars collapsed after a makeshift path paid on iron sheets caved in due to overload

﻿

In a freak accident, a truck trailer heavily laden with iron bars collapsed after a makeshift path laid on iron sheets and beams suddenly caved in near Central Railway Station due to overload.

Subway construction work is being undertaken by Chennai Metro Rail near Central Railway Station from last July after erecting strong iron beams and with iron sheets placed above. Vehicular traffic was allowed on the temporary path on EVR Salai besides diversions.

According to police, the truck carrying heavy iron bars which could be weighing around 60-70 tons was moving on EVR Salai. Even as the cab and major portion trailer had moved from the spot, suddenly, the temporary road could not withstand the heavy load and caved in, and the trailer sank into it.

Additional Commissioner of Police Traffic, N.Kannan and other officers reached the spot and swung into a major operation to pull out the vehicle. Mr. Kannan said, “Our personnel with the help of men and machinery from Chennai Metro Rail pulled out the vehicle in the morning. The traffic will soon normalise in the afternoon.”

Traffic diversions

The following diversions have been implemented on EVR Salai due to the ongoing emergency work in Central Junction.

Vehicles coming from Kilpauk, Vepery proceeding towards Parry's can take a left turn at PLC point, Choolai roundabout, Moolakothalam junction, Walltax road and reach Central and Parry's Corner.

Vehicles coming from Parry's Corner proceeding towards Koyambedu can take Muthusamy point, Wallajah point, Anna Salai, Periyar statue, Chintadripet, Gandhi Irwin bridge to reach EVR Salai.

Only vehicles involved in emergency medical duty, doctors and medical staff on duty at Rajiv Gandhi Hospital will be allowed through Central Point.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/9helv8/article32942221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/topple,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/road-caves-in-near-central-railway-station/article32942222.ece

2,2020/10/26,Luxury hotels in Coimbatore open their kitchens for takeaways,"As the city gradually opens up after subsequent lockdowns, luxury hotels innovate to keep their kitchens busy: from curated meals in a box to grand thaalis in eco-friendly packaging, they now home-deliver food

Dive into a comforting bowl of pasta or a curated chef’s meal of regional fare featuring kola urundai, Pallipalayam chicken, and keerai kootu, all packed in a luxury hotel kitchen, then delivered right to your front door. To tide over the slowdown triggered by COVID-19 in the hospitality industry, hotels in the city have started takeaway services and are also now home-delivering meals through their in-house fleet.

Indian Hotels Company Ltd, which operates the Taj group of hotels, recently launched its own online food delivery platform called Qmin. “The idea is to offer quality cuisine by the Taj to diners at their homes,” says K Prem, director of sales, Vivanta Coimbatore. Qmin is already operational in Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi.

He explains how their takeaway menus have been curated keeping in mind how food looks and tastes after travelling a certain distance. “Our delivery associate also shares detailed instructions on the assembly of the meals,” he says, adding that comfort food is proving to be the most popular. “The menu packs in what is available at our restaurant Latitude — a selection of kebabs and curries. Signature dishes like water chestnut mushroom, and fish in xo sauce from our Chinese restaurant Red Pearl are available as well,” explains Prem, adding that one can also order quesadillas and penne bolognese.

The hotels ensure that associates wear masks and gloves and follow social distancing norms to ensure a safe home-delivery experience. In a bid to enhance the dining experience, packaging is elegant and eco-friendly.

We have an ongoing Gujarati, Rajasthani and Rajwadi thaali menu that is also available in a box. Our chef from Surat has curated the menu with over 15 items that includes batata vada, khaman dhokla, mini undhiyu, Surati kadhi, sada bhat, toor dal khichdi, puri and shrikhand.” The hotel has also launched Diwali with Mariott, where they deliver artisanal treats.

Hotels like the ITC Welcome Group already on food delivery platforms have diversified into new revenue streams. “We have launched a Flying Brunch that is delivered at home,” says Erine Louis, General Manager. The menu is an indulgent blend of cuisines that includes starters like vazhaipoo cutlet and samosa chaat, followed by a main course of breads and dal makhani, as well as biryani, schezwan fried rice and sweet basil tomato mozzarella pizza. “We deliver an average of 13 brunches during weekdays and over 40 in the weekends,” he adds.

Who would have thought that luxury hotels would deliver food to homes? asks D Charles Fabian, Director of Operations, The Residency Towers and says, “We wanted to stay connected with our customers and keep our chefs engaged with the wok and the ladle. During the lockdown, cakes and breads from our bakery did brisk business as takeaway. Then, we added Chinese, and more South Indian items like biryani, kozhi varutha curry, and mutton rogan josh. A few months into lockdown, people got bored of home-made food and our takeaways started doing well.”

Now, the hotel also offers Regenerate Takeaways where they blast freeze cooked dishes at minus 18 degrees. “These can be ordered, stored in your refrigerator and reheated and used when required. We give clear instructions on how to do so. We also launched DIY kits such as those that help one make handmade linguini with vegetables,” explains Fabian, and adds, “The lockdown period gave us ample time to experiment and innovate with fusion. We even made a cake out of sushi without adding sugar or cream for a takeaway order!”",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/vpcf2t/article32945893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Marriott--Rajwadi-thali-to-go,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/star-hotels-in-coimbatore-open-their-kitchens-for-takeaways/article32945899.ece
3,2020/10/26,Fancy a tipple delivered right at your doorsteps?,"Hyderabad-based company Booozie is setting out to deliver alcohol at doorsteps across the country

Imagine getting your favourite wine home-delivered. Hyderabad-based social networking platform Booozie is introducing web and app-based home delivery of liquor. Already active in Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha, Booozie has also submitted proposals to seven other States and is hopeful of getting permission in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

Founded by Vivekanand Balijepalli and Susovan Mazumdar, Booozie was initially conceptualised as a platform for liquor connoisseurs to share their experiences, reviews and cocktail recipes. But now, says Vivekanand, “We want to make Booozie a one-of-its-kind liquor delivery service, through which any bar or liquor store can do business. We will operate as a delivery aggregator by picking up liquor from the nearest shop, with an upfront payment to stores without any commission from stores. We are doing well in States where we have started operations.”

Booozie’s revenue comes from the delivery cost that is decided on the distance and cost of the products. The founders are also keen on portraying Booozie as a social drinking platform, a tool for social networking and stress relief. Susovan, co-founder and CPO, says, “The huge $30 billion and ever-increasing liquor industry in India can be overwhelming to many, and many underlying issues have never been addressed. This attempt to enter a territory that has not been ventured into in the past is exciting.”

The startup also claims to be the world’s first social drinking platform, apart from doorstep delivery of liquor. It features a database of bars and clubs in every city, offers and events at each, an exhaustive catalogue that lists the brands and current MRP of brands available in every State of India.

Safety checks

The developers say they will promote responsible drinking. “Our platform has a cut-off slab of ₹15,000 per month for its customers. It also comes with a ‘face liveliness check’ to ensure a minor is not misusing the app to procure drinks,” says Vivekananda.

The liveness check verifies the features being presented to the biometric application with that of the person. This helps in identifying fake ids.

Vivekanand adds, “On the consumer front, we observed a certain stigma in stepping out for consumption and purchase of liquor. We decided to come up with a platform which makes liquor consumption a fun, yet responsible experience. The manufacturers of alcohol brands can benefit by following the reviews and trends on our platform. Technology has been integrated to ensure age-gating, seamless delivery and one-step payments, all of which are currently lacking in the alcohol space.”

The app is the flagship brand of Innovent Technologies, and is currently in its first phase of operations. It was during the COVID-19 induced lockdown that the founders worked on developing Booozie. “Liquor shops were closed and there was f demand. We started studying the liquor industry and decided to work on this idea,” says Vivekanand.

“In the post-COVID era, there will be a huge demand for online delivery of liquor. We welcome the change in policy adopted by various states to permit this,” he states.

The app can be found in Google Play Store and Apple App Store, and the website is www.booozie.com.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/trbfwk/article32944570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/boozie,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/booozie-the-app-for-home-delivery-of-liqour/article32944571.ece
4,2020/10/26,Old Delhi Foods delivers food from the Walled City,"Old Delhi Foods delivers parathas, chaat, butter chicken and more, from the walled city to our homes

For a spell of instant magic in the good old days, I often used to visit a corner of Chawri Bazar, near the Metro Station. This was a place called Ashok Chat Corner, and it sold the most delicious papri-chaat that you could ever imagine. There was a time, years ago, when women of the neighbourhood would sit on their little murhas by the chaat counter once they had a free hour or so. They would have a nice chatty session while they dug into their bhalla papri and popped golgappas.

That was, of course, a long time ago, when there was hardly any traffic. Now you can’t think of sitting anywhere on the road in Chawri. Worse, you can’t think of going there either, in these COVID-19 times.

I had really been missing my Old Delhi sojourns. And then I heard about a great service that had started in the city. A platform called Old Delhi Foods delivers food from Old Delhi to you. I went to the website and found that they bring food from eateries such as Chaina Ram, Shyam Sweets, Kuremal, Lotan Kulchey Chholey Wallah, Shiv Misthan Bhandar, and Natraj. They will get you fried parathas from Parathey Wali Gali, chicken kali mirch from Al Jawahar and butter chicken from Aslam. And they even deliver food from old favourites that are not in Old Delhi, such as Ashok and Ashok Meat Wallah in Sadar and Sitaram Chholey Bhaturey in Paharganj.

We had some friends coming over one day, so I asked for four plates of papri chaat (₹135 a plate) from Ashok, and dal urad fry (₹210), paneer butter masala (₹230) and baigan bharta (₹205) from Shakahari in Chandni Chowk. With shipping and handling charges of ₹150, I paid a total of ₹1,335.

The rates, I think, are a little higher than what the eateries charge. Orders and payments have to be done online (via olddelhifoods.com; 7289938122 and 9311734330).

The service is now only available in Delhi, and for a minimum order of ₹900. The chaat was as good as it used to be. I love Ashok’s chaat for its balanced flavours — nothing is too sweet or too tangy or too hot. They use yellow chilli powder, which is pungent but not red hot. Freshly roasted and ground cumin adds to the taste, as does a pinch of rock salt.

The chaat was well packed. Each ingredient — papri, bhalla, curd, saunth (sweet red chutney), boiled chholey, potatoes, kachalu and masala had been packed separately. I mixed them together, and the chaat disappeared before I could say, ‘Have some more.’

I was, however, a bit disappointed with the Shakahari fare. I have had some great meals there, and there is nothing quite like having their dal and sabzi with delicious besan rotis. Shakahari, also in Chawri Bazar, is known for its urad dal. But this time I found it a bit too runny. The paneer, again, was in a buttery sauce that didn’t quite work for me. The bharta tasted good; the brinjal had been roasted well. Of course, the food was all cooked in desi ghee, so the flavours were nice.

Old Delhi Foods, I must say, is doing a great service. Can’t go to Old Delhi any more? Fret not — it will bring Old Delhi to you!

5,2020/10/26,Anger against NDA in Bihar will result in Mahagathbandhan win: Prithviraj Chavan,"BJP’s promise to give free COVID-19 vaccines is reprehensible: Prithviraj Chavan

Predicting victory for the Mahagathbandhan in the Bihar Assembly polls, senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan said there was resentment against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and cracks in the alliance between the party and Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United).

“There is internal resentment against JD(U), which is riven by factionalism,” said Mr. Chavan, MLA from Karad South in Satara district.

The statements came in the wake of a new row between the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners after some BJP posters dropped Mr. Kumar’s image, while retaining only that of the Prime Minister.

Alleging that it was the BJP that directed its covert ‘ally’, the Chirag Paswan-led Lok Jan Shakti Party (LJP) to oppose the JD(U), Mr. Chavan said the poll would result in a win for the grand coalition of Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Congress and other Left parties. Mr. Prasad’s son, Tejashwi, is the projected chief ministerial candidate of the alliance.

‘New line of leaders’

“There is an undertow of sympathy for Lalu Prasad as he has been shunted in jail for many years now. A new generation of young leaders from the grand coalition has now emerged,” he said.

Mr. Chavan said the BJP’s announcement to give free COVID-19 vaccines in Bihar was “reprehensible” and a crude vote-garnering tactic. “I condemn that statement in their manifesto... The Centre is shamelessly politicizing the pandemic by saying, in effect, that Bihar will get free vaccines if it votes for the BJP. This is intolerable. Vaccines must be provided to all States, irrespective of whether they are poll-bound or not,” he said.

“Instead of developing a fair and equitable strategy to distribute Covid-19 vaccine to all Indians, BJP’s Bihar manifesto suggests #vaccinepolitics to win Bihar election. Singling out one state for free vaccines for a political advantage is blatantly unfair, illegal and inhuman,” Mr. Chavan earlier tweeted.

Launching a broadside on the Modi government, Mr. Chavan said it only wanted to win elections at any cost and that it had no concerns for either the farmers or the crumbling economy. “India’s economy was in freefall even before the pandemic. Demonetisation, imposition of the Goods and Services Tax and now the lockdown has resulted in a lethal situation where the economy is poised to collapse. In the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21, India’s economy regressed by an unprecedented 24% — something that has never happened in 200 years,” Mr. Chavan said.

Castigating the Centre for steamrolling the agriculture reform Bills in Parliament, he said the BJP had neither consulted its allies nor any of the 250 farmer outfits before passing them by voice vote.

‘Will intensify protests’

“The Congress’s agitation against the agrarian reform laws will intensify in the coming days. Today, even Bangladesh, a country that India helped create, has surpassed us in terms of the per capita income…India’s economy has become a source of real concern,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/876pah/article32947584.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMPRITHVIRAJCHAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/anger-against-nda-in-bihar-will-result-in-mahagathbandhan-win/article32947586.ece
6,2020/10/26,Muslim forum condemns beheading in Paris,"Indian Muslims for Secular Democracy calls for abolishing apostasy, blasphemy laws

Intellectuals and activists from the Muslim community condemned the beheading of a French schoolteacher, at a webinar organised by Indian Muslims for Secular Democracy (IMSD) on Sunday.

The webinar began by observing a two-minute silence to pay homage to history teacher Samuel Paty who was murdered by a Chechen extremist on October 16 for showing cartoons of Prophet Mohammed to pupils in a class discussion on free speech in a school near Paris.

IMSD convener Javed Anand said, “We are here to condemn in unequivocal terms, no ifs and buts, not only the man responsible for this barbaric act but all those who had any role in the instigation of the crime as also all those who seek to justify it. We are here not just to condemn the slaying of Mr. Paty, but also to demand the abolishing of apostasy and banishing of blasphemy anywhere and everywhere across the world.”

‘Killing against law’

Mumbai-based Islamic scholar Dr. Zeenat Shaukat Ali said killing people for blasphemy or apostasy is not permissible in Islam. “The Quran never mentioned such punishments. The Quran has stood for peace and justice in a non-violent way. It will be very fruitful if scholars and Ulema scrutinised and sifted through the Hadith literature, which has been pending over the years. The confirmation of a Hadith has to be in consonance with the verses of the Quraan,” she said. “Respectfully, the Paris beheading is a wake-up call to the Ulema and leaders of the Muslim world,” Dr. Zeenat added.

Delhi-based columnist Arshad Alam argued that the prime objective of such acts of terror is to silence any critique of Islam. “Charlie Hebdo cartoons must be seen within a European tradition which has for long satirised religious traditions, particularly Christianity. Since Islam is also now a European religion, the same yardstick must be applied to this religion also. Those who want to retain blasphemy laws on the statute are basically the same forces which are opposed to the liberal secular tradition and therefore should be rightly understood as indulging in rightwing politics,” he said.

Mr. Alam argued that it is incumbent on Muslims to raise their voice against the laws of blasphemy and apostasy as worldwide they are the worst victims of such laws. Moreover, these laws serve to control and intimidate the minds of Muslims and till the time they are not abrogated, Muslims and others will not have the freedom to discuss, debate and critique, something which is cardinal in order to develop a free and open society.

A.J. Jawad, Chennai-based advocate and mediator, spoke about the similarities between blasphemy and sedition as weapons of power and control used by theocracies and autocracies to suppress dissent and to whip up mob frenzy. He said religion and nationalism are excuses used to charge up emotions. Anti-blasphemy and anti-sedition laws are used to attack detractors and dissenters by theocratic and autocratic rulers.

Feroze Mithiborwala, Mumbai-based activist and writer, said the basic argument against cartoons of Prophet Mohammad is that they “mock” and “offend religious sensibilities” and should be banned. Such cartoons, which undoubtedly hurt the feelings of ordinary Muslims, actually required a non-violent response; this would have been far more effective, he said.

“On the one hand, we have a murder committed by a religious fanatic in the name of blasphemy. On the other hand, there is a secular French tradition of absolute freedom of expression, which includes the right to offend all religions,” Mr. Mithiborwala said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/muslim-forum-condemns-beheading-in-paris/article32947561.ece
7,2020/10/26,Nitin Raut seeks reforms in islanding system,"Minister visits State load dispatch centre

Energy Minister Nitin Raut on Monday visited the Maharashtra State Load Dispatch Centre to study the reasons behind the recent power failure and review the functioning of the facility. Officials from Tata Power and Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) were also present at the meeting.

“We discussed how to secure the islanding of Mumbai in such situations. The embedded power for the city should remain stable in any given circumstance. Considering the demand and supply of electricity by 2030, we have to plan the transmission and distribution of electricity. The peak hour power demand of Mumbai is now 2800 MW and is estimated to reach 5000 MW by 2030. Factors like production, load, frequency, and maintenance need to be considered in future planning. The islanding system will need changes to ensure smooth power supply,” Mr. Raut said.

“Officials were asked why the islanding system failed on October 12 in Mumbai. The islanding system came into existence in 1981 and officials were asked if it was regularly maintained and updated. Even as Tata Power and AEML assure 1400 MW, the power provided by them is usually around 900 MW. Both Tata Power and AEML have been instructed that such an event should not occur in future,” Mr. Raut said.

The Minister told Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Ltd (MSETCL) officials that its staff should undergo periodic training. “Required changes should be made to the facility and provisions should be made to collect real time data which would help in tackling such situations. There should also be coordination with the weather department,” he said.

Mr. Raut told MSETCL officials to study the state-of-the-art system used by major cities in the world to maintain 24x7 power supply and secure the grid during such emergencies. “We have to study it and build our system accordingly,” Mr. Raut said.

He said allegations of foul play in the power outage can be confirmed only after he receives the investigation report. Principal Secretary (Energy) Aseem Kumar Gupta, chairman and managing director of MSETCL Dinesh Waghmare, and MSETCL director (operation) Sanjay Takasande were also present at the meeting.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rt3b7y/article32947489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMRAUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/nitin-raut-seeks-reforms-in-islanding-system/article32947490.ece
8,2020/10/26,"Won’t make statements against Bhatts, Luveina Lodh tells HC","Court hearing plea against actor for defamatory comments on the two film-makers

In what may bring an interim relief to film-makers Mahesh and Mukesh Bhatt, actor Luveina Lodh’s lawyer told the Bombay High Court on Monday that she has not and will not make any defamatory statements.

A single bench of justice AK Menon was hearing a suit filed by the Bhatts seeking urgent injunctive reliefs against Ms. Lodh and refraining her from making, publishing, circulating any defamatory/slanderous comments against them and also seeking damages of ₹1 crore each for the act of defamation on the part of the actor by publishing an offending video making various grossly defamatory, slanderous, distasteful and patently false allegations and statements against the director on her Instagram account.

The advocate appearing for Ms. Lodh told the court that his client will not make any statements against the brothers. The court then restrained Ms. Lodh from making and circulating any defamatory statements against the Bhatts and granted her three weeks to file her reply.

In the video, Ms. Lodh has alleged that her husband Sumit Sabharwal is Mr. Mahesh Bhatt’s nephew and supplies drugs and women and Mr. Bhatt operates the system.

According to the plaint, “On October 23, Ms. Lodh posted an offending video making some allegations against the duo. The next day the video was picked up by various news agencies and was published in various media reports which has further resulted in dissemination of defamatory material against the Bhatts.”

It mentions, “On October 24, a notice was sent to Ms. Lodh stating: delete the video from Instagram and/or any public platform within 24 hours, furnish an unconditional apology and post it on Instagram by saying the contents of the video are untrue and stand withdrawn and furnish a proof that you have complied with the above requisitions.”

The plaint adds, “Despite the receipt of the said notice, Ms. Lodh has till date neither removed the video from her Instagram account nor has she complied with any other requisition in the notice. Hence the suit.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/n47rgt/article31960285.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-BOMBAY-HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/wont-make-statements-against-bhatts-luveina-lodh-tells-hc/article32945355.ece

In a message, Mr. Pawar, who is also the State’s Finance Minister, said his health condition is fine.

State Health Minister Rajesh Tope also said Mr. Pawar’s health is normal and he has been admitted to hospital only for the purpose of rest.

“He (Pawar) is normal. He has been admitted to the Breach Candy Hospital only for the purpose of rest as at his home he keeps getting phone calls from people and he gets no rest then,” Mr. Tope told a TV channel.

Mr. Pawar in his message said, “I have tested positive for COVID-19. My health condition is fine. As a precautionary measure, I have got admitted to Breach Candy Hospital on the advice of doctors.”

The NCP leader also said the party workers and citizens need not worry about his health and that he will be back among all after a brief period of rest.

On Thursday, Mr. Pawar tested negative for coronavirus, but was in quarantine at his official residence ‘Devgiri’ here as a precautionary measure.

Mr. Tope said Mr. Pawar’s family members had also undergone COVID-19 tests and their results were negative.

10,2020/10/26,"Sena responds to BJP criticisms, questions delay in awarding Bharat Ratna to Savarkar","BJP had called out Sena for failing to rein in ruling partner Congress’ criticism of VD Savarkar.

A day after the BJP slammed Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for being silent on the Congress’s criticism of V D Savarkar, the Shiv Sena on Monday hit back and asked why the BJP has not yet given Bharat Ratna to the late Hindutva ideologue.

The Congress is Shiv Sena’s ally in the State’s ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi, which also includes the NCP as a partner.

Talking to reporters in Mumbai, Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut reiterated that Bharat Ratna, the country’s highest civilian award, be given to the “great and Hindutvavadi leader” Savarkar.

During the Shiv Sena’s annual Dussehra rally on Sunday, party president Thackeray delivered his speech at the Savarkar hall in Dadar area in Mumbai due to COVID-19 norms instead of the usual venue, the sprawling Shivaji Park.

Later, State BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye accused the ruling party of compromising on Hindutva for power.

“Uddhav Thackeray did not say a word about the Congress criticising Savarkar and now he had to address the Dussehra rally from the Savarkar auditorium. This is poetic justice,” Mr.Updhaye further said.

Reacting to the comments, Mr. Raut on Monday said the Shiv Sena has “never kept quiet on the issues relating to Savarkar and it will never do so“.

Without naming the BJP, Mr. Raut said the party should browse through history to know the Shiv Sena’s stand on issues involving Savarkar.

“Veer Savarkar has always been the mentor of the Shiv Sena and Hindutva. Those who are raising questions on us...why are they not giving the Bharat Ratna to Veer Savarkar?” the Rajya Sabha member asked.

11,2020/10/26,"Stop victimisation of Republic TV journalists, Editors Guild urges Mumbai police","It is also states that the channel should start “behaving responsibly”.

The Editors Guild of India on Monday called on the Mumbai police to stop victimising journalists of Republic TV by filing FIRs against them, while also stating that the channel should start behaving responsibly.

The Editors Guild said in a statement that it was “pained to see the unedifying spectacle of hundreds of FIRs being filed against journalists of the Republic TV, which is under probe for allegedly manipulating TRPs and spreading discontent against the Mumbai police”.

The Guild said: “We do not wish to influence the probe by the authorities, even if we recognise it has the potential to bring in much needed transparency on the manipulation of popularity, and creation of ‘proceeds of crime’ - as claimed by the police; but the victimisation of the journalists should immediately stop. The use of arbitrary state power is not and has never been in the interests of working journalists.”

The Guild said the ongoing standoff between the channel and the Mumbai Police was unprecedented.

“Besides the unsavoury details pertaining to the manipulation of TRPs, Republic TV’s high-strung conduct during the unfortunate demise of film actor Sushant Singh Rajput also raises issues about media credibility and the limits to reporting...It is high time the channel behaves responsibly and not compromise the safety of its journalists as well as hurt the collective credibility of media,” the statement said.

Researchers at Eindhoven University of Technology in Netherlands have found evidence of a sophisticated Russian online black market that trades user profiles, allowing criminals to access valuable information, including credit card details.

The marketplace offers over 2.5 lakh highly detailed user profiles, including email addresses and passwords, the team said in a study titled ‘Impersonation-as-a-service: Characterising the Emerging Criminal Infrastructure for User Impersonation at Scale’.

The uniqueness of this underground website is not only its scale, but also the fact that all the profiles are continually updated, the team said.

Additionally, attackers can search the database to select an internet user they want to target, enabling highly dangerous spear phishing attacks. They can also download software that automatically loads the purchased user profiles in targeted websites.

The team coined the term ‘impersonation-as-a-service’ to define the systematic nature of the service. It is the largest and most sophisticated criminal marketplace to offer these services, they said.

15,2020/10/26,Apple’s security check fails second time in six weeks,"Once installed, the apps would download and install the OSX/MacOffers malware.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Six malicious apps that posed as Adobe flash player have bypassed Apple’s App notarisation process for the second time in the past six weeks, according to Joshua Long, Chief Security Analyst at Mac security software maker Intego.

Once installed, the apps would download and install the OSX/MacOffers malware. The virus uses a technique that hides the malicious payload within a separate JPEG image file, which is why it slipped past Apple’s notarisation process.

Apple notarisation is a security protection system introduced earlier this year. Mac software developers submit their apps to Apple. An automated system scans software for malicious content and checks for code-signing issues with an aim to assure users that the Developer ID-signed software has been checked by Apple.

If the software appears to be malware-free, Apple notarises the app and place it in the whitelist inside the Apple Gatekeeper security service. After an app it notarised, it becomes much easier for users to run the app on macOS Mojave, macOS Catalina, and the upcoming macOS Big Sur.

This increases the chances of a victim installing Trojan horse malware that sneaked through the security process undetected. This marks the second incident of Apple notarising Mac Malware samples after the first known incident occurred in late August.

Mac malware researcher Matt Muir discovered the first sample while hunting for malware that removes registration requirements or other restrictions that limit software functionality.

While Long said nobody should believe any site that prompts them to download or update Flash. Most malware makers are able to succeed with Flash installers since many users are unaware that Adobe plans to discontinue security updates for the real Flash Player at the end of this year and browsers have already dropped support for Flash Player or disable it by default.

“Never install Flash Player if you’re prompted to; it’s a telltale sign of malware,” Long mentioned.

Apple has revoked the malware developer’s known certificate but it won’t necessarily help Macs that have already been infected.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/3v4iej/article32944229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/apple-malicious-apps-bypassjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/apples-security-check-fails-second-time-in-six-weeks/article32944195.ece
16,2020/10/26,"Get ready to chuck that charger, the future of over-the-air charging is coming","How Seattle-based technologist Srinivasan Sridharan conceptualised an innovative ‘over-the-air’ charging mechanism that leverages Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

“My phone ran out of charge.” This is probably one of the most often-used excuses for avoiding work-related calls today.

If Srinivasan Sridharan has his way, this might be history. The Seattle-based innovator recently filed a patent for ‘Systems and methods for authorisation and billing of users for wireless charging’ — where he is listed as an ‘inventor’ — on billing ‘over the air’ wireless charging. Let us say you pay ₹100 a month to your telecom service provider and you never have to charge your phone using a wired charger, because it can automatically charge ‘over the air’ using the cell tower site’s dissipated radio frequency energy.

This is the core concept behind Srinivasan’s latest project. His day job, as a Principal Engineer–System Design (5G) with T-Mobile, helps him to keep updated on the latest developments in technology, which in turn, gets him thinking about such innovations. The idea behind the current patent took shape when he wondered if a cell site tower could be viewed as an energy source and if that can be billed.

Seattle-based technologist Srinivasan Sridharan

“My patented algorithm would check if a user is a subscriber with the cellular company for the wireless charging service. It would authorise the user’s smartphone based on 3rd generation partnership program (3GPP) nodes to use the cell site’s Radio Frequency energy based on the subscription and the status of the phone,” he adds. This also means that the cellular company will have the capability to start and stop the wireless charging once it crosses a particular value. “It can differ from tower to tower and be custom-made depending on requirements,” he explains.

Driven by the future

Tamil Nadu-born Srinivasan’s passion is an extension of his everyday job that revolves around system design, analysis and quality engineering of advanced telecommunication Technologies such as 5G, 4G and the Internet of Things.

“The newer versions of Apple’s iPhone and Watch, and Samsung Galaxy smartphones can charge themselves while they are placed on a wireless charging pad. However, these devices must be in physical contact and must literally be placed on the exact position designed for it to work properly,” he says. Over-the-Air Wireless Charging, on the other hand, is “contactless and truly wireless” according to him. “One might not even notice that their phone is charging while it is in their pocket or handbag,” he adds. His patent ties in with the latest cutting-edge inventions in the consumer electronic battery industry across the world that questions the need for wires and electricity, for charging. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are the backbones of this technology.

“The wireless charging circuit on the devices would be constructed using logical algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) that would decide when to charge the battery based on the energy levels from the source and existing battery percentage,” puts forth Srinivasan, explaining that a smartphone and a wearable smart watch can be charged by a wireless source simultaneously. The device would also be able to learn your charging patterns based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms implemented.

Looking ahead

With several companies working on over-the-air wireless charging technologies, the day might not be far when we can get rid of the charger we hold dearly to.

“Technically, India is fully prepared to adopt this practice once the Government bodies approve it after duly examining any safety concerns,” adds Srinivasan, who did his schooling in Chennai and Coimbatore, before working with leading telecommunication companies in India and the US over the last 15 years. The number of wireless providers in India has been a cause of concern — Rajinikanth’s film 2.0 broached this topic as well — but it could be a blessing in disguise for this new charging concept.

“More wireless providers mean more cell sites and more dissipated radio frequency energy potentially available to be used as the ‘source’ for wireless charging. Also, most of the urban middle class today have an in-home Wi-Fi router which would enable us in adopting the technology.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/untb5x/article32943456.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/charging2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/srinivasan-sridharan-over-the-air-wireless-charging-patent/article32943460.ece
17,2020/10/26,Pakistani PM asks Facebook CEO to ban Islamophobic content,"In response to Khan's appeal, a Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters the company was against all forms of hate and that it did not allow attacks based on race, ethnicity, national origin or religion.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Pakistan's prime minister has appealed to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to ban Islamophobic content on the site, warning of an increase in radicalisation amongst Muslims, the government said on Sunday.

In a letter, which the Pakistani government posted on Twitter, Imran Khan said that “growing Islamophobia” was encouraging extremism and violence across the world, especially through social media platforms such as Facebook.

“I would ask you to place a similar ban on Islamophobia and hate against Islam for Facebook that you have put in place for the Holocaust,” Khan said.

Facebook said this month it was updating its hate speech policy to ban any content that denied or distorted the Holocaust.

“One cannot send a message that while hate messages against some are unacceptable, these are acceptable against others,” Khan said, adding that this was “reflective of prejudice and bias that will encourage further radicalisation”.

In response to Khan's appeal, a Facebook spokeswoman told Reuters the company was against all forms of hate and that it did not allow attacks based on race, ethnicity, national origin or religion.

“We'll remove this hate speech as soon as we become aware of it,” the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement, adding that the company had “more work to do”.

Khan, in his letter, referred to the situation in France, where, he said, Islam was being associated with terrorism.

Earlier on Sunday, Khan said that French President Emmanuel Macron had “attacked Islam” by encouraging the display of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad.

Khan's comments came after Macron paid tribute to a French history teacher beheaded by an Islamist radical who wanted to avenge the use of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/ewvnt8/article32942280.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/imran-khan-reutersjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/pakistani-pm-asks-facebook-ceo-to-ban-islamophobic-content/article32942272.ece
18,2020/10/26,Google notified of 21 adware gaming apps on Play Store,"The apps contain adware which is part of the HiddenAds family, displaying intrusive ads, luring users into downloading the adware by posing as gaming apps.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Cybersecurity firm Avast has discovered 21 adware gaming apps on Google’s Play Store, and reported them to search giant, and Google is investigating the reports.

Off the 21 apps containing advertising supported software that automatically displays unwanted advertisements, 19 are still available on the Play Store.

They have been downloaded about eight million times, according to the data by mobile app marketing intelligence and insights firm, Sensor Tower.

The apps contain adware which is part of the HiddenAds family, displaying intrusive ads, luring users into downloading the adware by posing as gaming apps.

Numerous user reviews on Google Play Store mentioned that sports, puzzle, car and helicopter gaming apps that contain HiddenAds adware were advertised to them on YouTube, promising a different game than what was offered.

Avast explained the apps promised to virtually let users fly across the road, trees, hills to shoot criminals from a helicopter, or for household enthusiasts, allow players to virtually iron their clothes.

After the download, advertisements started flooding their phones.

“Developers of adware are increasingly using social media channels, like regular markets would,” Jakub Vavra, Threat Analyst at Avast said in a statement.

“The popularity of these social networks make them an attractive advertising platform, also for cybercriminals, to target a younger audience.”

The HiddenAds is a Trojan disguised as a safe and useful application which repurposes the existing gaming applications by adding aggressive HiddenAds features. Identifying the adware becomes difficult since it hides their icons and display relevant looking advertisements.

However, users can avoid falling prey to such apps by checking if the apps’ developer account has only one app on Google Play. Additionally, they can read app permission requests and reviews, which usually contain low rating and cite functionality issues along with excessive ads.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/r8q9fe/article32942228.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/malicious-adwarejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-notified-of-21-adware-gaming-apps-on-play-store/article32942204.ece

20,2020/10/26,U.S. sanctions Russian institute linked to dangerous malware,"Treasury said last year the attackers behind the malware were reported to be scanning and probing at least 20 electric utilities in the United States for vulnerabilities.

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Washington imposed sanctions on Friday on a Russian research institute tied to the development of a dangerous computer program capable of causing catastrophic industrial damage, a move that Russia called illegitimate.

The U.S. Treasury Department alleged that the Russian government-backed Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics - also known by its Russian acronym, TsNIIKhM - was responsible for “building customized tools that enabled the attack” on an unidentified petrochemical facility in the Middle East in 2017.

The attack electrified the cybersecurity community when it was made public by researchers that year because - unlike typical digital intrusions aimed at stealing data or holding it for ransom - it appeared aimed at causing physical damage to the facility itself by disabling its safety system.

Nathan Brubaker, an analyst with cybersecurity company FireEye - which discovered the software involved - said the apparent intent made it uniquely dangerous because disabling safety systems at a plant like that one could lead to serious consequences, such as a fire or an explosion.

“The acute nature of the threat is what makes it scary,” Brubaker said. “Blowing things up and killing people thats terrifying.”

Treasury also said last year the attackers behind the malware were reported to be scanning and probing at least 20 electric utilities in the United States for vulnerabilities.

“We emphasize once again the illegitimacy of any one-sided restrictions. Russia, unlike the United States, does not conduct offensive operations in cyber domain,” Anatoly Antonov, Russia's ambassador to the United States, said on social media.

“We call on the United States to abandon the vicious practice of unfounded accusations.”

U.S. officials have been on a tear in the past month, filing a glut of indictments against hackers in Russia, China and Iran, levying sanctions, and issuing several warnings about state-backed digital intrusions.

21,2020/10/26,OnePlus 8T review: Should OnePlus take a breather?,"Despite a whip-smart Warp Charge 65 charger and butter-smooth operations, we look at yet another OnePlus sequel — the fourth release in a pandemic year

There was a time when smartphone releases used to be anticipated. Of course, much of the suspense was a result of savvy marketing. But a brand released one phone a year. And, there weren’t any ‘leaks’, so to speak. Now, phone release schedules are like the Fast and Furious movies; by the time one comes out, you can be fairly certain that the next is on its way. Do not get swayed by phrases like ‘one last ride’; the ‘ride’ might be nearing its end but none of the smartphones, in the foreseeable future, are likely to be the ultimate one.

The OnePlus 8T is not. It is the fourth smartphone OnePlus has released this year. There was OnePlus 8; a week later came the flagship OnePlus 8 Pro. Then OnePlus Nord, a ‘midrange’ phone which was a wild card for the brand. Now, as predicted since the launch of the annual ‘T’ series in 2016, we now have OnePlus 8T (starting from ₹42,999), which is difficult to categorise. That, per se, is not a big concern.

Specifications Screen size & weight: 6.55”; 188 g

6.55”; 188 g Resolution: 2400 x 1080 pixels 402 ppi (Fluid AMOLED)

2400 x 1080 pixels 402 ppi (Fluid AMOLED) Camera: Rear: 48+16+5+2 MP; Front: 16 MP

48+16+5+2 MP; Front: 16 MP CPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon 865

Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 RAM and Storage: 8GB/12GB & 128GB/256GB UFS 31.1 2-LANE

8GB/12GB & 128GB/256GB UFS 31.1 2-LANE Battery: 4500mAh (non-removable) Warp Charge 65 (10V/6.5A)

But it begs the question: why do we need another phone so soon? If you don’t want to get into all that and want to know only about 8T, here goes.

Adept as usual

There are no big surprises with the 8T and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Most of its features, of course, are present in its three predecessors released this year. It is perhaps better to repeat what has been working so well for the brand.

The 8T has all the solid features that we have come to expect in a OnePlus phone. Ready with Android 11 and OnePlus’ minimally-designed Oxygen OS, the device also has great display and processor, super-quick refresh rate, fast charging, and more.

The 6.55-inch phone (available in Lunar Silver and Aquamarine Green) has a flat display, compared to the curved edge top of its cousin, 8. With the Snapdragon 865 processor backed by an 8 gigabyte RAM, you seldom experience a lag and overheating. The AMOLED 2400x1080 display comes with a refresh rate of 120 Hz. The operations, hence, are butter-smooth. But compared to the shift from 60 to 90 Hz, the 90 to 120 Hz increment is almost unnoticeable, unless you are gaming. It’s not like we are running programs to find new sub-atomic particles on our smartphones.

Among the most impressive things about the 8T is its combination of 4,500 milliampere-hour battery and a Warp Charge 65 charger, a match for Oppo’s fast-charge tech. You can use this charger for tablets and other smartphones, too. But the 8T does not support wireless charging. In 15 minutes, the charge surged from 15 to 68%, which was enough to last a day (full charge in 38 minutes). You hardly need to be away from your phone anymore (but it’s good if you do, at least for a while — in which case, you can use the digital well-being feature or the Zen Mode).

Same old peeves

You know what is coming, don’t you?

Yes, the camera, indeed. The 48-megapixel Quad Camera is one of the key selling points of 8T. The broad, rectangular four-camera-plus-two-flash strip is a departure from OnePlus’ usual vertical three-camera set-up. The extra camera in the 8T is a 2 megapixel monochrome sensor for taking black-and-white photos. It saves you from an additional step(s) of making the photo black and white. But I did not find it significantly better than a good black-and-white filter.

You might find it easier to take close-up shots though as the macro lens has been upgraded from 2 megapixels to 5 megapixels. The 48-megapixel main lens and 16-megapixel wide lens are unchanged. You can get way better pictures with minimum effort than you would with most midrange phones. But, if you compare the camera to iPhone’s or Pixels’, it falls short.

Is there is a flickering hope for the return of the 3.5-millimetre AUX headphone jack in phones that are and above midrange? We should probably start a hashtag campaign or a candle-light march to bring it back.

Like the previous versions, it does not have an IP rating for water resistance either; though OnePlus continues to promise that the device can withstand inclement weather.

Overall, if you already got the 8, 8 Pro, or Nord, you need not kick yourself, for the 8T is not significantly better than its antecedents.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/36ie2v/article32943164.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27mp-OnePlus8T2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/oneplus-8t-review-yet-another-oneplus-sequel-in-a-pandemic-year/article32943168.ece
22,2020/10/26,Samsung Galaxy Buds Live review: Disruption in design and performance,"Dubbed the ‘rajma earbuds’, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live offer a snug and high-fidelity audio experience — for a hefty price

For about three years, earbud designs seemed limited to the variety of the AirPods with the protruding mics, and the basic designs where the wing-tip fits snugly in the ear. Frankly, concept designs other than these seemed gimmicky and impractical but then Samsung dropped the Galaxy Buds Live and these flashy little beans actually became the coveted audio accessory of the year.

Retailing for ₹14,990 the Buds Live occupy the midrange to premium vertical of earbuds and they live up to their promise. Out of the box, they are nestled in their glossy charging case, which, disappointingly is ABS plastic, putting off the premium target. The case itself is not a stunner to match what is within. A better design would have complemented the buds’ chromatic sheen, which are certainly an eye-catcher even when worn.

Specifications Earbud dimensions & weight: 16.5 x 27.3 x 14.9mm; 5.6g

Charging case dimensions & weight: 50.0 x 50.2 x 27.8mm; 42.2g

Chipset: BCM 43015

Battery: 60mAh earbud ; 472mAh charging case

Quick charging: 60min play / 5min charging (Wired, Wireless, D2D)

The first time I tried the Buds Live, it took a couple of tries to get the fit right; essentially the speaker has to slide closer to the ear entrance while the wing-tip sits snugly within the arc. There is breathability to avoid excess moisture build-up for long stretches of wear time, which is a plus for the in-ear earbuds segment. I am a big fan of in-ear earbuds purely because they promise immersive sound but the invasive nature brought up by doctors always concerned me. The Buds Live, however, sit neatly without feeling too loose or dizzyingly tight. It helps that each earbud is just 5.6 grams, quite light given the deceptively heavy look.

If you are a Samsung loyalist, then you may already have the Wearable app — the system where you can oversee the connectivity and gadget performance of a connected wearable — but if you are dipping in from iOS or Android, the Galaxy Buds app lets you adjust the EQ as desired. Sporting Bluetooth v5.0 as a standard, make sure your smartphone is up to date, software-wise. Those simultaneously using a variety of Samsung gadgets — such as smartphones and tablets — can easily switch pairings between these devices. Those who have paired the Buds Live with devices from other brands will have to manually switch over, which isn’t too bad... just a couple of extra seconds.

Those who enjoy Bixby, Samsung’s virtual assistant, will see some remarkable improvements to the responsiveness via the Buds Live. In the companion apps, one can access, via the Labs section, the hands-free Bixby activation. And yes, this does marginally affect battery power.

Now, press play

Oh, the sound: great acoustics that elevate vocals to true-to-life clarity, offering an intimate audio experience. Thanks to the 12mm drivers with AKG tuning, look forward to high-fidelity and glitch-less listening. The dynamic bass levels are not too jarring and the snares have a hard knock while synths feel delightful.

The touch and tap commands are fairly easy to learn, ranging from single to triple taps. The Buds Live offer a game-upper in the form of Active Noise Cancellation which can be activated at will using touch commands. This is ideal for fitness regimes and streaming, sessions that don’t require external sounds.

The battery on the Buds Live is, as expected, powerful; it offers a pretty decent wear time. The battery case has a 472mAh capacity while each bud has 60mAh, enough for a solid few hours and a few workout sessions. Recharging takes just a few minutes, but I haven’t reached a point yet where the buds were fatigued.

24,2020/10/26,"Bihar Assembly elections | BJP raises Article 370, Ram temple construction","Launching the campaign in Seemanchal, Nadda praises Nitish government

Kickstarting the campaign in Purnia in the Seemanchal region of Bihar, BJP president J.P. Nadda and Law Minister Ravishankar Prasad reiterated the jungle raj vs development narrative and also touched upon the dilution of Article 370 and construction of Ram Temple.

Mr. Nadda said that in the 2015 elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given a special package of ₹1.25 lakh crore to Bihar. In addition, ₹40,000 crore has been spent more on Bihar’s infrastructure in the last couple of years. Crediting Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for construction of roads, providing electricity and maintaining law and order, Mr. Nadda said all these would be reversed if any other party comes to power.

“Who is CPI(ML)? Who killed Ram Bhakts? They are anarchists. And now the anarchists and the RJD which is a destructional party have come together. To add to this is the Congress,” Mr. Nadda said adding ex-Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had opposed the dilution of Article 370 that gave special status to Kashmir. “Pakistan Prime Minister used the same logic presented by Rahul Gandhi in the U.N. Shashi Tharoor criticises India on a Pakistani platform. Don’t start opposing the country while opposing PM Narendra Modi,” Mr. Nadda said.

The rally was thinly attended as the audience had been waiting since noon and had already started leaving by the time Mr. Nadda and Mr. Prasad reached the venue at 4:30 pm they had already started leaving.

Pointing at the scattered crowd, many of whom had their phones out to click pictures of the rally, Mr. Prasad said, “Could you have openly flashed your phone during the Lalu regime. Nitish Kumar and Sushil Modi’s government is giving computers and mobile phones in your hands,” he said.

Mr. Prasad obliquely mentioned the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya. “Ram Lala ke vakil kaun the?

25,2020/10/26,Bihar Assembly elections | Tej Pratap goes all out to woo Hasanpur,"The RJD chief’s elder son has moved out of Mahua to a ‘safer’ seat

At Hasanpur Assembly constituency Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) candidate and elder son of party chief Lalu Prasad, Tej Pratap Yadav is going all out to woo the locals — playing cricket youngsters, driving a tractor, and sharing sattu (gram flour) and litti-chokha, a local snack, with young voters.

Mr. Yadav has moved out of his constituency Mahua in Vaishali district to Hasanpur in Samastipur and is pitted against two-time sitting NDA MLA Rajkumar Rai of the JD(U).

According to the political buzz, Mr. Tej Pratap, who is embroiled in marital dispute with Aishwarya Rai, granddaughter of former Bihar chief minister Daroga Prasad Rai and daughter of Chandrika Rai, chose to move out from Mahua amid rumours that Ms. Rai might be fielded against him.

The Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) and Lok Janshakti Party have fielded Arjun Yadav and Manish Kumar respectively in the constituency, which is likely to divide the Yadav votes.

“RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav might have chosen this constituency as a safe seat for it is being dominated by M-Y (Yadav and Muslim) voters which has been core vote bank of RJD since long,” political analyst Ajay Kumar told The Hindu.

Hasanpur has over 70,000 Yadavs, nearly 40,000 Muslim, 18,000 Paswan, 12,000 Kushwaha and over 10,000 upper caste votes.

Ahead of his younger brother and party’s CM face Tejashwi Yadav’s campaign in Hasanpur on Monday, Tej Pratap Yadav tweeted to local people saying his “Arjun” was coming to address them.

Hasanpur is known for its defunct sugar mill, the Magadh Sugar & Energy Limited, with Mr Tej Pratap’s campaign office located in the iconic Chini Mill (sugar mill) Chowk.

At the office late one evening last week, some young are having an animated discussion on the campaign while others are dozing on mattresses spread on the floor. Mr Tej Pratap who was campaigning in the Beethan area, was expected to return late at night.

“Everyday he sets off on his campaign trail by 8 in the morning and returns late … he is staying at nearby town of Rosera with relatively good hotels,” shares a young man, wearing a T-shirt with Tejashwi Yadav’s picture in front and a slogan “Bihar mange Badlaw (Bihar demands a change)” on the reverse.

At a tea shop outside the main RJD office, the discussion, as the sun sets on a cool evening, turns inevitably to the forthcoming election.

“Who is going to vote for a candidate like him (Tej Pratap Yadav)?... We’ll vote for Lalu Prasad, not him,” says Ramadhin Yadav, a voter in his sixties.

But why not?

“When he doesn’t meet us here, how can we meet him in Patna after his election,” ask the men.

“But, we’ll vote for him in the name of Lalu Prasad who has been imprisoned for a long time in a conspiracy hatched by Nitish Kumar and BJP,” they say in a chorus.

One of the group, Ramesh Kushwaha, however, says Mr. Nitish Kumar brought in development by constructing roads and bringing electricity everywhere. The JD(U) candidate Rajkumar Rai should be elected again, says Mr. Kushwaha.

“We should elect an MLA from local area and an MP from outside as we can meet the MLA to get our local work done and the MP for works outside the constituency and State,” he suggests.

“Tej Pratap is an outsider and the JD(U) candidate is local and also simple man,” he adds but is shouted down by others, most of them Yadavs.

“Voting for Rajkumar Rai is to bring Nitish Kumar again in power which we don’t want… We’ve nothing against the JD(U) candidate but we don’t want Nitish Kumar as CM again,” they say firmly.

Leading the NDA charge, Prime Minister Narendra Modi flew down to address as many as three rallies where he urged the voters to vote Chief Minister Nitish Kumar back to power.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, whose party is contesting the elections in alliance with Lalu Prasads RJD and three Left parties, also chipped in with two rallies.

The BJPs quest for dominance over the State’s political scene, evident from a seat-sharing deal as part of which it clinched nearly as many constituencies as the JD(U) its senior partner so far- resonated during the election campaign.

Mr. Modi, as also other BJP star campaigners like Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and party president Jagat Ptakash Nadda, repeatedly cited Ram temple at Ayodhya, scrapping of Article 370 and law against triple talaq as achievements of the government at the Centre and attacked the Opposition for opposing these.

The 69-year-old Chief Minister, who is also the JD(U) president and is seeking a fourth term in power, carried out a strenuous campaign which began with a series of virtual rallies and has been followed by dozens of election meetings where he has been physically present, including two where he shared the stage with the Prime Minister.

The normally unflappable Mr. Kumar made news on more than one occasion for losing his cool and snapping at protesters from the Opposition camp who turned up at his rallies raising slogans.

RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, who has been named by his party as its Chief Ministerial candidate, also ran an indefatigable campaign which comprised rallies, video messages relayed through the social media and press conferences.

Massive turnouts and enthusiastic response from the crowds at his rallies have been a surprise for political observers who have underscored that the ambience spoke more of the anti-incumbency than the appeal of the former Deputy CM.

Another huge draw has been Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan who stunned all with his decision to go solo in the Assembly polls.

37-year-old Chirag Paswan began campaigning actively rather late, only after the customary mourning after the death of his father Ram Vilas Paswan was over on October 20.

The LJP chief has, thereafter, hit the streets with a vengeance canvassing for his candidates, a sizeable chunk of whom happen to be rebels from the BJP and the JD(U) which he has vowed to dislodge from power in the state while proclaiming loyalty towards the saffron party.

Other prominent leaders who have campaigned in the State so far include Union Ministers Rajnath Singh and Smriti Irani, Congress leaders Raj Babbar and Shatrughan Sinha, BSP chief Mayawati and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi.

Besides, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman flew down to release the BJP manifesto which promised, among other things, free coronavirus vaccination.

Many prominent leaders fell prey to the contagion while campaigning, which saw them among large numbers of people without necessary vaccinations. These included Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and former Union Ministers Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Syed Shahnawaz Hussain.

Altogether 1,066 candidates are in the fray for the first phase of elections, 114 of them females.

BSP president Mayawati on Monday warned voters in Bihar to guard against “conspiracies” of rival parties as she sought support for her party’s alliance in the polls.

Voting for 243 Assembly seats in Bihar will be held on October 28, November 3 and November 7.

In a tweet, the former U.P. Chief Minister said, “Preparations for the first phase of the Bihar Assembly elections begins today with the end of the election campaign. Therefore, there is an appeal to everyone that they should take care against all kind of conspiracies and tactics of opponents and cast their votes and make the BSP and RLSP coalition successful”.

28,2020/10/26,Bihar Assembly election | Nitish Kumar is no longer the poster boy for Mahadalits,"‘We were promised land, now we even have to silently bury our dead,’ they say

There is deep cynicism among the Rishidev community, one of the 21 Mahadalit castes in Bihar, with village after village echoing the same hopelessness that nothing is going to change for them no matter who comes to power.

Also read: Analysis | Tejashwi Yadav narrows gap as confusion plagues NDA

The Mahadalit was a division created by Janata Dal (United) leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in 2007, his first term, carving out a constituency for himself in the deeply caste-driven society of Bihar. The group has steadily remained with Mr. Kumar in the Assembly elections.

Thirteen years on, Khakri Devi in Thari Khanva village, in Rupauli Assembly constituency around 50 km away from Purnia town, asked, “Naam oh Mahadalit hai, ki mila che? (We just have the tag of Mahadalit, what did we get?)”.

One question was enough to open a floodgate of complaints, with a group of women and old men all trying to speak at the same time. “Doosri baar jeeta toh bola tha 3 dismil zamin dega, abhi toh koi mar jaaye toh lash ko gaadne ka zamin nahi hai, raat ko chura ke gaadna padta hai. (When he was elected the second time, we were promised 3-dismil (approximately 1306.8 square feet) land. But now we don’t even have land to bury our dead, we have to silently bury them at night). The conflict is largely with Muslim landowners in the area.

Lack of work

There are no younger men in the villages, majority of them have gone to work in the fields of Punjab as there is little work to come by here. Soon after the travel restrictions were lifted many have returned to their places of work. Post lockdown, the bus fare to travel to Punjab is ₹3,000, which many of them borrow at an interest rate of 10%. “If there were factories here, why would we need to go to Punjab,” Phoolchand Rishi said.

In Dhokva village in Damdaha Assembly constituency, Samuri Devi is clear, “Abki baar kisko vote nahi denge (This time, I won't cast my vote), ” she declares. Women huddle around, complaining loudly. “We don’t have school, panchayat bhavan, ration cards or roads. We have got nothing from the government.”

Where the single lane concrete road ends, the village starts. There are no pucca or brick houses, just a collection of straw huts. There are no street lights, no television sets at their homes or even the Swachch Bharat toilets. Most of the children are walking around barefoot and only a few have clothes covering their backs.

Among the litany of complaints, the primary plea is “koi sunwai nahi hoti” (No one listens to us). Most of them are daily wagers who get work for less than 10 days in a month. Public Distribution System coverage is scanty, some in the village have managed to get a BPL card but most are not covered under the National Food Security Act. Hearing the debate about the ration cards, Chini Devi rushed to her home to bring a collection of well-preserved long-expired ration cards. “Hamare paas sab purja hai (I have all the papers),” she says, but laments that for years now she has not got ration.

Corruption in bureaucracy

There is uniformity of complaints about largescale corruption in bureaucracy. Dinesh Rishi is willing to show scraps of papers to anyone who is willing to hear about how the government owed him ₹1.5 lakh under the Indira Awas Yojana, but ₹30,000 out of this sum is missing and all he is left with is a half-finished house.

All the persons mentioned here had voted for the JD (U) in the 2015 elections. Both Damdaha and Rupauli constituencies are with the JD(U). They remain silent about their choice in the coming 2020 Assembly elections. “Right now the campaign has not started, we will see,” Virendra Rishi said.

Though they are disenchanted with Mr. Kumar, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is not an option, they say, simply because the 15 years of the RJD government had meant further marginalisation for them. Now, they can openly lament, but back then, they recall they did not have the right to even complain. The stock reply is that they will vote for the “winning candidate” and this will be decided on the eve of polling, depending on the “mahaul” (atmosphere).

29,2020/10/26,COVID-19 cases continue to surge in Sri Lanka,"More contacts linked to 2 recent clusters test positive for the virus

Sri Lanka’s COVID-19 cases continued to surge, taking the total number to nearly 8,000, as more contacts linked to two new clusters identified this month were tested for the coronavirus over the weekend. The total number of deaths rose to 16.

On Monday, authorities said Sri Lanka’s Parliament would be shut for two days for disinfection, after a member of the Special Task Force, on security duty, tested positive. The development comes days after the House convened for the debate on and subsequent passage of the controversial 20th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution with nearly all the 225 legislators attending the session.

Meanwhile, police expanded its “quarantine curfew” orders to include several localities in and around Colombo this weekend. Health authorities said there was no evidence yet of community transmission, as all positive patients have been traced to one of the two latest clusters — at a garment factory and a fish market in Colombo — or their immediate contacts. No isolated case has been reported outside of these two key clusters, to be termed as a community spread, according to Dr. Sudath Samaraweera, Chief Epidemiologist at the Ministry of Health.

However, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) — a trade union of medical professionals in the public sector — warned that Sri Lanka is on the “verge of” community transmission of COVID-19 and any neglect on the part of the authorities could spell dangerous consequences.

As the number of COVID-19 positive cases continues rising, Sri Lanka’s coronavirus infrastructure, including the army-run quarantine centres, appeared to be under pressure.

On Monday, Army Commander Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva, who heads the National Centre for the Prevention of COVID-19, told media that first-tier contacts of COVID-19 patients will henceforth be asked to self-quarantine themselves in their homes, instead of being taken to quarantine centres.

Source unidentified

After the global pandemic hit Sri Lanka in March, the country went into a stringent lockdown for about two months, in addition to closing its borders. The country’s early measures to contain the pandemic drew high praise including from the World Health Organization, allowing authorities to go ahead with the general elections in August.

However, the recent wave appears to have caught the country unawares. Health authorities are yet to identify the source of this outbreak, identified on October 4, that has since spread to 19 of the island’s 25 districts, according to data published by the Epidemiology Unit.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xb6g6/article32947202.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-VIROUSOUTBREAKSRILANKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-cases-continue-to-surge-in-sri-lanka/article32947203.ece
30,2020/10/26,China’s Communist Party holds key policy conclave,"Plenum to chalk out economic policies for the next 5 years

China’s Communist Party (CPC) on Monday began a key conclave of top leaders that will set the direction for the country’s economic policies for the next five years.

The 14th five-year plan (2021-2025) and a longer-term “Vision 2035” blueprint will be in focus at the fifth plenary session, or plenum, of the CPC’s Central Committee, which meets for such sessions once a year.

China’s State media reported President and CPC General Secretary Xi Jinping on Monday delivered a work report at the start of the plenum, attended by the around 200 members of the Central Committee, and “explained a draft document of the CPC Central Committee's proposals for formulating the 14th Five-Year (2021-2025) Plan for Economic and Social Development and future targets for 2035.”

This is the first such party meeting since the COVID-19 pandemic, and is also the highest-level economic policy meeting held once every five years. The party will likely hold two more such party plenaries, focusing on other themes such as party governance, before its next leadership congress in 2022 when it will choose a new Politburo and Central Committee.

As with the economy-focused plenum five years ago, the current four-day session, being held at the high-security Jingxi hotel in Beijing, will firm up the next five-year plan. The 14th plan (2021-2025), the official Xinhua news agency reported, will ""lay out measures to nurture a new development pattern”.

Three themes are expected to be in focus. The first is what Mr. Xi has pushed as a new “dual circulation” model, placing greater emphasis on self-reliance and the domestic market as a driver of growth — a task that has taken on greater urgency against the backdrop of the trade war with the U.S. and the pandemic triggering a collapse in global demand and unemployment problems domestically — while striking a better balance with external demand.

Rising debt

China’s rising debt problem is another concern, one exacerbated by the pandemic with the government loosening the purse-strings to sustain growth. According to a forecast by UBS, China’s debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise by 25 percentage points to 300 percent of GDP this year because of recent measures.

The five-year plan and the 2035 blueprint are also expected to highlight more balanced growth, with a focus on greener development. To meet the target announced last month by Mr. Xi at the United Nations General Assembly for the country to go carbon neutral by 2060, China will need to reduce the share of coal in its energy mix from the 58% as of 2019 to less than 50% by 2025, according to an estimate from Zou Ji, head of Energy Foundation China, reported Reuters.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/i9g4aa/article32946711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-XIJINPING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinas-communist-party-holds-key-policy-conclave/article32946712.ece
31,2020/10/26,"Biden, Trump on final campaign blitz","The last leg of battle comes amid surging virus cases and White House staring at a second outbreak

President Donald Trump plans to intensify an already breakneck travel schedule in the final full week of the presidential campaign, overlooking a surge of coronavirus cases in the U.S. and a fresh outbreak in his own White House.

Mr. Trump is expected to hit nearly a dozen states in his last-ditch effort to recover ground from Democrat Joe Biden, including Sunday’s trip to Maine and Tuesday’s to Nebraska. Both States award electoral votes by congressional district and could be crucial in a tight election. Mr. Trump will hold 11 rallies in the final 48 hours alone.

Mr. Biden is staying close to his Wilmington, Delaware, home on Monday. But he plans to pick up his travel schedule later in the week, aiming to hit the six battleground States the campaign sees as key to his chances, some with socially distanced in-person events and others with virtual events. On Tuesday, the former vice president is traveling to Georgia, a state that hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in more than a quarter-century but where polls show a tight race.

The final week of the campaign is colliding with deepening concerns about a public health crisis in the U.S. Mr. Trump is eager for voters to focus on almost anything else, worried that he will lose if the election becomes a referendum on his handling of the pandemic. Mr. Biden is working to ensure the race is just that, hitting Mr. Trump on the virus and presenting himself as a safer, more stable alternative.

Pence’s aides infected

The stakes were clear this weekend as the White House became the locus for a second outbreak of the virus in a month. Several close aides to Vice-President Mike Pence tested positive for the virus, including his chief of staff, Marc Short. Mr. Pence, though, was insistent on maintaining his aggressive political calendar, even though he was deemed a “close contact” of his adviser, claiming the privileges of being an “essential employee.”

The latest outbreak has served as a potent metaphor for the divergent approaches the Trump and Biden campaigns have taken to the virus. On Sunday, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said that “we’re not going to control the pandemic” and the focus should be on containment and treatment. Mr. Trump aims to pack thousands of people, most without face coverings, across some of the upper Midwestern states bearing the brunt of the surge. “We want normal life to resume,” Mr. Trump said on Sunday. “We just want normal life.”

Mr. Meadows, pressed to explain why the pandemic cannot be reined in, said, “Because it is a contagious virus just like the flu.” He told CNN’s “State of the Union” that the government was focused on getting effective therapeutics and vaccines to market.

Mr. Biden, in a statement, said Meadows’ comments continued with the Trump administration waving “the white flag of defeat” in the face of the virus.

Mr. Meadows, for his part, attempted to do some cleanup on Monday, telling reporters that while the administration is “not going to control” the virus it “will try to contain it as best we can.”

“The only person waving a white flag along with his white mask is Joe Biden,” Mr. Meadows said.

Mr. Biden’s team argues the coronavirus is likely to blot out any other issues that might come up in the final days of the campaign — including Mr. Biden’s recent debate-stage comment in which he affirmed he’d transition away from oil, later walked back as a transition away from federal subsidies. That strategy appeared to pay off as the outbreak in Mr. Pence’s staff refocused the national conversation once again on the pandemic.

Mr. Trump and his team, meanwhile, have struggled to settle on a closing message, with the undisciplined candidate increasingly trusting his gut over his advisers. He’s grasped for dirt on his Democratic rival and used apocalyptic terms to describe a Mr. Biden presidency, but Mr. Biden has thus far proven more resilient to such attacks than Mr. Trump’s 2016 rival.

“You can certainly expect that (Biden) will focus on COVID as it continues to, unfortunately, rise all across the country,” Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in an interview. “It is disrupting people’s lives and people are looking for a leader to put in place plans to get it under control.”

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday joined calls for a boycott of French goods, ramping up a standoff between France and Muslim countries over Islam and freedom of speech.

Mr. Erdogan has led the charge against President Emmanuel Macron over his robust defence of the right to mock religion following the murder of a French schoolteacher who had shown his class cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.

‘Mental checks needed’

On Monday, the Turkish leader added his voice to calls in the Arab world for citizens to spurn French goods.

“Never give credit to French-labelled goods, don’t buy them,” Mr. Erdogan, who caused a furore at the weekend by declaring that Macron needed “mental checks,” said during a televised speech in Ankara.

French goods have already been pulled from supermarket shelves in Qatar and Kuwait, among other Gulf states, whereas in Syria people have burned pictures of Mr. Macron and French flags have been torched in the Libyan capital Tripoli.

The October 16 beheading of high-school teacher Samuel Paty by a Chechen extremist caused deep shock in France.

Paty had shown his pupils some of the Mohammed cartoons over which 12 people were massacred at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015.

In the aftermath of Paty’s murder, Mr. Macron issued a passionate defence of free speech and France’s secular values, vowing that the country “will not give up cartoons.”

As the backlash over France’s reaction widened, European leaders rallied behind Macron.

European support

German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned Erdogan’s “defamatory” remarks about the French leader.

The Prime Ministers of the Netherlands and Greece also expressed support for France, as did European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.

33,2020/10/26,China ‘to sanction’ U.S. companies,"Lockheed Martin, others targeted for ‘involvement’ in arms sales to Taiwan

China will impose sanctions on Lockheed Martin, Boeing Defense, Raytheon and other U.S. companies it says are involved in Washington’s arms sales to Taiwan, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday.

The two U.S. giants were involved in a recent sale of nearly $2 billion worth of missiles to Taiwan, alongside Raytheon, and foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian urged the U.S. to stop arms sales to the island.

The status of Taiwan holds potential for conflict between the United States and China, during a wider struggle for technology, security and trade supremacy.

Beijing says Taiwan is an inviolable part of China to be reclaimed, by force if necessary.

Mr. Zhao said the sanctions were “to safeguard national interests” and would apply to those who have “behaved badly in the process of arms sales to Taiwan”.

“We will continue to take necessary measures to safeguard national sovereignty and security interests,” said Mr. Zhao, without giving further details on the sanctions.

Under the administration of President Donald Trump the U.S. has brought Taiwan into play as part of a wider diplomatic and economic squeeze of its rival, sending high-level envoys and boosting arms sales.

The State Department said last week it had approved the sale of 135 air-to-ground missiles, in a move welcomed by Taiwan.

Also approved was the sale of six MS-110 air reconnaissance pods and 11 M142 mobile light rocket launchers, taking the value of the three arms packages to $1.8 billion.

‘Future threats’

Beijing has ramped up diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, who views the island as a de facto sovereign nation and not part of “One China”.

A statement from the U.S. State Department last week said the SLAM-ER missiles would help Taiwan “meet current and future threats”.

The missiles provide “all-weather, day and night, precision attack capabilities against both moving and stationary targets” on the ground or ocean, the statement added.

Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said the weapons would help it “build credible combat capabilities and strengthen the development of asymmetric warfare”.

Chinese fighter jets and bombers have entered Taiwan’s air defence zone with increasing frequency in recent months, while propaganda films have shown simulated attacks on Taiwan-like territories.

China has also launched a diplomatic offensive aimed at courting Taiwan’s few official allies, persuading the Solomon Islands and Kiribati to switch sides last year.

34,2020/10/26,Airstrike in northwestern Syria kills over 50 rebel fighters,"It said it also suspected the airstrike was carried out by Russia, which is a close ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad in the country’s civil war.

Russian airstrikes killed 78 Turkey-backed rebels in northwestern Syria on Monday, a monitor said, in the bloodiest surge in violence since a truce almost eight months ago.

More than 90 others were wounded when Russian warplanes targeted a training camp of the Faylaq al-Sham faction in the Jabal Duwayli area in Idlib province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

In March, a truce brokered between Moscow and Ankara stemmed a deadly months-long Russia-backed regime military offensive on the country’s last major rebel stronghold in Idlib

That onslaught from December had displaced almost a million people from their homes in one of the worst humanitarian crises of the nine-year civil war.

Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman described Monday’s strikes as the “deadliest since the ceasefire came into force”.

The National Liberation Front, an umbrella group of Ankara-backed rebels based in Idlib that includes Faylaq al-Sham, told AFP that Monday’s Russian strikes hit one of its positions and caused casualties. It did not give an exact death toll.

NLF spokesman Sayf Raad denounced the “Russian aircraft and regime forces continuously violating the Turkish-Russian deal in targeting military positions, villages and towns”.

Of the almost one million people displaced in the last Idlib offensive, more than 2,00,000 have returned home to their towns and villages, most since the ceasefire went into force.

Endangers truce

The March truce has largely held, despite some intermittent bombardment in the area from both sides. Russian air strikes have from time to time targeted military positions, including those of Turkey-backed groups, Abdel Rahman said.

After a string of military victories backed by Russia, the Syrian government has regained control of around 70 percent of the country, the Observatory says.

35,2020/10/26,Australia protests Qatar airport's invasive search of women passengers,"Australia on Monday condemned Qatar authorities’ treatment of female passengers on a flight to Sydney who were subjected to invasive searches after a newborn baby was found abandoned at a Doha airport.

The women, including 13 Australians, were examined at Hamad International Airport on Oct. 2 after Qatar Airways Flight 908 to Sydney was delayed.

Australia’s foreign affairs department described the treatment of the women as inappropriate and beyond circumstances in which they could give free and informed consent.

“This is a grossly, grossly disturbing, offensive, concerning set of events,” Foreign Minister Marise Payne told reporters. “It’s not something that I’ve ever heard of occurring in my life, in any context. We have made our views very clear to the Qatari authorities on this matter.”

Australia will await a report from the Qatari government before “we will determine the next steps,” Ms. Payne said.

She said the matter was reported to Australian Federal Police, but did not explain what action police might take. Police said in a statement they are working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the matter and that further comment would be inappropriate.

The baby was still unidentified and was being cared for by medical and social workers, airport officials said in a statement sent to AP.

Medical professionals were concerned for the mother’s health and had requested she be located, it said. “Individuals who had access to a specific area of the airport where the newborn infant was found were asked to assist in the query,” it added.

The statement did not acknowledge the forced examinations.

The women were examined in an ambulance parked on the tarmac, Seven Network News reported.

Wolfgang Babeck, who was returning home to Australia on the flight, said women were taken from the plane regardless of their age.

“When the women came back, many of them or probably all of them were upset. One of them was in tears, a younger woman, and people couldn’t believe what had happened,” Mr. Babeck said.

“They told me they had to take their underwear off or their clothes from the bottom and then it was inspected whether they had given birth,” he added.

Mr. Babeck said no explanation was provided for why the departure was delayed for more than three hours or why women were required to leave the plane. He said the examinations were conducted by a woman.

The passengers are now in 14-day hotel quarantines in Sydney as part of coronavirus measures.

36,2020/10/26,"Nawaz Sharif attacks Pak. Army, ISI chief as Opposition says ‘sun about to set’ on Imran government","The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a coalition of 11 Opposition parties, was formed to oust Mr. Khan from power on September 20

Pakistan’s deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has blamed Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa and ISI chief Lt. Gen. Faiz Hameed for the current political situation in the country, as the Opposition parties held their third massive joint rally against Prime Minister Imran Khan-led government.

The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a coalition of 11 Opposition parties, was formed to oust Mr. Khan from power on September 20. The alliance held two massive back-to-back gatherings in Gujranwala and Karachi this month. The third rally was held in Quetta, capital of the restive Baluchistan province, on Sunday.

Addressing the gathering via video link from London, the three-time Prime Minister and chief of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) again blamed Army chief Bajwa and ISI Director General Hameed for Pakistan’s current situation.

Gen. Bajwa, you will have to answer for record rigging in the 2018 elections, for horse-trading in Parliament, for making Imran Niazi Prime Minister against people’s wishes and [by] tearing apart the Constitution and laws, for pushing people towards poverty and hunger,” 70-year-old Mr. Sharif said.

Mr. Sharif, who is entangled in a number of corruption cases, has been in London since November last year after the Lahore High Court granted him permission to go abroad for four weeks for treating the heart disease and an immune system disorder.

He also accused the ISI chief of “interfering in politics for several years with impunity” in violation of his oath. Mr. Sharif said that he names individuals “because I don’t want my Army to be defamed”.

Pakistan’s Army has denied meddling in politics. Prime Minister Khan also denies that the Army helped him win the election in 2018.

“Looking at this enthusiasm, I am sure that no one will be able to violate the voters’ mandate now. I saw this enthusiasm in Gujranwala and Karachi, and now I’m seeing it in Quetta,” Mr. Sharif said, addressing the huge crowd at the stadium.

“I am aware of Baloch people’s problems, Nawaz Sharif knows [...] the missing persons issue is still there. I feel pain when I see the victims,” he said, in an apparent reference to the forced disappearance of hundreds of Baloch people.

He said that the PDM has risen against “unconstitutional powers that have made Pakistan hollow from inside and out“.

This is not the first time Mr. Sharif has made such allegations against top Army brass; he made similar ones in the Gujranwala rally after which a furious Prime Minister Khan had declared that he would get tougher with the Opposition.

Mr. Sharif’s daughter and PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz in her speech said that time has come to change the fate of Pakistan - and Balochistan.

“No longer will husbands and brothers go missing, people of Balochistan,” she said, addressing the attendees.

“The reason you are deprived of food and shelter is that your vote is not respected. Those who rule you are not answerable to you but to someone else, someone else pulls their strings,” she said.

Ms. Nawaz said that the “sun is about to set” on the current “dictatorial regime” and the puppet show will soon come to an end .

Addressing the rally via video link, Pakistan People’s Party chief Bilawal Bhutto Zardari asked, What sort of a democracy is this where the media isn’t free and neither is the judiciary.”

In his speech, Balochistan National Party President Sardar Akhtar Mengal lashed out at the Khan government and establishment over the missing persons’ issue.

He also alleged that since 1947, governments had never kept their agreements with the Baloch people and they were not treated as equal citizens of the country.

Meanwhile, Mohsin Dawar, a big critic of the government, was taken into custody by security officials at the Quetta airport on Saturday when he arrived for the rally.

Home Minister Ziaullah Langove said that there was a ban on Mr. Dawar’s entry in the province. The ban is set to expire on October 29.

Mr. Dawar, a lawmaker and leader of Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), tweeted that he had been told he was not allowed to enter because of security risks and said he refused to be silenced like this. and will not be intimidated.

As the public meeting began at the Ayub Stadium in Quetta on Sunday, the city witnessed a blast that killed three people and injured seven others in Hazarganji area, 35 to 40 minutes away from the rally site.

According to police, an improvised explosive device (IED) was planted in a motorcycle.

Undeterred by the blast, the PDM leaders went ahead with the rally, which was attended by PDM president Maulana Fazlur Rehman and other top leaders of the coalition.

The National Counter Terrorism Authority had earlier issued a security alert saying it received credible information that opposition rallies in Quetta and Peshawar could be targeted by militants.

The provincial government had asked the PDM not to hold the rally given the threats. However, PDM leaders rejected the call.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k6qks7/article32942141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PAKISTANRALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nawaz-sharif-attacks-pak-army-isi-chief-as-opposition-says-sun-about-to-set-on-imran-government/article32941975.ece
37,2020/10/26,U.S. Senate to confirm Barrett for Supreme Court in highly partisan vote,"Democrats criticise the move saying Republicans were willing to ignore the pandemic in order to rush the nominee forward.

A deeply torn Senate is set to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, Republicans overpowering Democratic opposition and institutional norms to secure President Donald Trump’s nominee the week before Election Day.

Ms. Barrett’s confirmation on Monday was hardly in doubt as Senate Republicans seized the opportunity to install a third Trump justice, securing a conservative court majority for the foreseeable future. With no real power to stop the vote, Democrats argued into the night on Sunday that the winner of the November 3 election should be the one to choose the nominee to fill the vacancy left by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

The 48-year-old appellate judge’s rise opens up a potential new era of rulings on abortion, gay marriage and the Affordable Care Act. A case against the Obama-era health law is scheduled to be heard November 10.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scoffed at the “apocalyptic” warnings from critics that the judicial branch was becoming mired in partisan politics as he defended its transformation under his watch.

""This is something to be really proud of and feel good about,” the Republican leader said on Sunday during a rare weekend session.

Mr. McConnell said that unlike legislative actions that can be undone by new presidents or lawmakers, “they won’t be able to do much about this for a long time to come.”

Vice President Mike Pence would typically preside over Monday’s vote, but after a close aide and others on his staff tested positive for the coronavirus, it was unclear whether he would attend. He is scheduled to hold a campaign rally in Minnesota, arriving back in Washington ahead of the expected evening vote.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the Trump administration’s drive to install Barrett during the coronavirus crisis shows “the Republican Party is willing to ignore the pandemic in order to rush this nominee forward.”

To underscore the potential health risks, Mr. Schumer urged his colleagues not to linger in the chamber but “cast your votes quickly and from a safe distance.” Some GOP senators tested positive for the coronavirus following a Rose Garden event with Mr. Trump to announce Ms. Barrett’s nomination, but they have since said they have been cleared by their doctors from quarantine.

The confirmation was expected to be the first of a Supreme Court nominee so close to a presidential election. It’s also one of the first high court nominees in recent memory receiving no support from the minority party, a pivot from not long ago when a president’s picks often won wide support.

Ms. Barrett presented herself in public testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee as a neutral arbiter and at one point suggested, “It’s not the law of Amy.” But her writings against abortion and a ruling on “Obamacare” show a deeply conservative thinker. She was expected to be seated quickly on the high court.

""She’s a conservative woman who embraces her faith. She’s unabashedly pro-life but she’s not going to apply ‘the law of Amy’ to all of us,” the Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on Fox News.

At the start of Mr. Trump’s presidency, Mr. McConnell engineered a Senate rules change to allow confirmation by a majority of the 100 senators, rather than the 60-vote threshold traditionally needed to advance high court nominees over objections. It was escalation of a rules change Democrats put in place to advance other court and administrative nominees under President Barack Obama.

On Sunday, the Senate voted 51-48 vote to begin to bring the process to a vote by launching the final 30 hours of Senate debate. Two Republicans, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, voted against advancing the nominee, and all Democrats who voted were opposed. California Sen. Kamala Harris, the vice presidential nominee, missed the vote while campaigning in Michigan.

Monday’s final tally was expected to grow by one after Ms. Murkowski announced her support for the nominee, even as she decried filling the seat in the midst of a heated race for the White House. Ms. Murkowski said on Saturday she would vote against the procedural steps, but ultimately join GOP colleagues in confirming Ms. Barrett.

""While I oppose the process that has led us to this point, I do not hold it against her,” Ms. Murkowski said.

Ms. Collins, who faces a tight reelection in Maine, remains the only Republican expected to vote against Mr. Trump’s nominee. “My vote does not reflect any conclusion that I have reached about Judge Barrett’s qualifications to serve,” Ms. Collins said. “I do not think it is fair nor consistent to have a Senate confirmation vote prior to the election.”

By pushing for Ms. Barrett’s ascension so close to the November 3 election, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies are counting on a campaign boost, in much the way they believe Mr. McConnell’s refusal to allow the Senate to consider Mr. Obama’s nominee in February 2016 created excitement for Mr. Trump among conservatives and evangelical Christians eager for a Republican president to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia.

Ms. Barrett was a professor at Notre Dame Law School when she was tapped by Mr. Trump in 2017 for an appeals court opening. Two Democrats joined at that time to confirm her, but none is expected to vote for her now.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/is6at8/article32941857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THAFPAMYCONEYBARRETT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-senate-to-confirm-barrett-for-supreme-court-in-highly-partisan-vote/article32941858.ece
38,2020/10/26,Thousands of seals found dead in Namibia,"The cause of the mass die off is yet to be established but scientists suspect anything from pollutants or bacterial infection to malnutrition.

An estimated 7,000 Cape fur seals have been discovered dead at a breeding colony in central Namibia, scientists said on Saturday.

Conservationist Naude Dreyer of the charity Ocean Conservation Namibia began noticing dead seals littering the sandy beaches of the Pelican Point colony near Walvis Bay city in September.

Then in the first two weeks of October he found large numbers of seal foetuses at the colony, Dr. Tess Gridley from the Namibian Dolphin Project told AFP by phone.

Fur seals normally give birth between mid-November and mid-December.

Gridley estimated that between 5,000 and 7,000 female seals had miscarried young with more still being found.

The cause of the mass die off is yet to be established but scientists suspect anything from pollutants or bacterial infection to malnutrition.

Some of the dead females found were “thin-looking, emaciated, with very little fat reserves,” said Gridley. Scientists are collecting samples for testing.

In 1994 some 10,000 seals died and 15,000 foetuses were aborted in a mass die off that was linked to starvation suspected to have resulted from a shortage of fish as well as from a bacterial infection at another breeding colony, the Cape Cross, some 116 kilometres north of the central tourist town Swakopmund.

39,2020/10/26,Japan PM Suga sets 2050 deadline for carbon neutrality,"He said the country would also push the use of renewable energy and nuclear power

Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Monday set a 2050 deadline for the world's third-largest economy to become carbon neutral, significantly firming up the country's climate change commitments.

“We will bring the total amount of greenhouse gas (emitted by Japan) to net zero by 2050, meaning carbon neutral,” Suga said in his first policy address to parliament since taking office. “I declare we will aim to realise a decarbonised society,” he added, to applause from Diet members.

Tokyo had previously only aimed to achieve carbon neutrality some time in the latter half of the century, a goal criticised by climate activists as vague and unambitious.

Suga did give a precise timeline for how Japan, a country still heavily reliant on coal, will achieve the goal but said technology would be essential.

“The key is innovation,” Suga said, citing examples including next-generation solar batteries.

He said Japan would also push the use of renewable energy and nuclear power, stressing that safety would be a priority — a key point in a country that suffered the Fukushima nuclear disaster.

Japan, which is a signatory to the Paris agreement, was the sixth-biggest contributor to global greenhouse emissions in 2018, according to the International Energy Agency.

Tokyo has been struggling to cut carbon emissions after shutting down its nuclear reactors following the 2011 meltdown in Fukushima sparked by a devastating earthquake and tsunami.

40,2020/10/26,Thailand parliament meets to debate political protest tensions,"The protesters have little confidence in the parliamentary path, declaring the government’s efforts insincere.

Thailand’s Parliament began a special session Monday that was called to address political tensions amid near daily pro-democracy protests demanding the prime minister’s resignation, constitutional changes and reforms to the monarchy.

Even as lawmakers debated, the student-led rallies were set to continue with a march through central Bangkok on Monday evening to the German Embassy, apparently to bring attention to the time King Maha Vajiralongkorn spends in Germany.

Also read | Explained: Why are Thai students protesting?

The scrutiny and public criticism of the monarchy that has been displayed by some of the protesters is unprecedented in a country where the royal institution has been considered sacrosanct. It has also led royalists to stage their own counter rallies and to denounce the protesters for raising the issue, increasing the risk of confrontation.

Speaker of the House Chuan Leekpai cautioned at the special Parliament session that it was not to discuss the monarchy’s role.

In his opening speech, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said he and his government are aware that this is an era of change, pushed by technology.

""But we have to admit that in Thailand, millions, tens of millions, of people do not want to see change through chaos,” he said, referring to different points of view over the protesters and their demands. “Everyone has their own beliefs.”

Mr. Prayuth, who led a coup in 2014 as the army chief, is disliked by the protestors as they say he was returned to power unfairly in last year’s election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party. The protesters also say the constitution, written and enacted under military rule, is undemocratic.

Instead of confronting lawmakers and counter-protesters at Parliament, the student-led protesters were marching to the German Embassy.

A small group of royalist demonstrators gathered outside the German Embassy earlier Monday ahead of the anti-government protesters. They submitted a letter for the German ambassador.

The letter accused pro-democracy protest organizers of seeking to poison the minds of students in order to destroy Thai society, and asked the envoy to carefully consider information from all sources to prevent “fake information” from causing damage.

A small number of police were stationed at the embassy for their demonstration, but several busloads arrived later, with helmets and riot shields, to provide security ahead of the arrival of pro-democracy protesters, whose numbers were expected to be much greater.

In Monday’s special session of Parliament, opposition leader Sompong Amornvivat of the Pheu Thai party criticised Mr. Prayuth for his handling of the crisis. He called on the government to listen to all the protesters’ demands, to amend the constitution, and to ease tensions by measures such as releasing arrested students and backing off from threats to censor the media.

The non-voting session of Parliament is expected to last two days.

The protesters have little confidence in the parliamentary path, declaring the government’s efforts insincere.

They noted the points of discussion submitted by Mr. Prayuth’s government for debate dealt not with the protesters’ concerns but were thinly disguised criticisms of the protests themselves.

They concern instead the risk of the coronavirus spreading at rallies, the alleged interference with a royal motorcade by a small crowd earlier this month, and illegal gatherings and the destruction of images of the royal family. Prayuth in his opening remarks referred to these as the reasons for holding the session.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bh5ust/article32941434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAILANDPROTESTSTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/thailand-parliament-meets-to-debate-political-protest-tensions/article32941435.ece

With nine days before Election Day, more people already have cast ballots in this year’s presidential election than voted early or absentee in the 2016 race as the start of in-person early voting in big states led to a surge in turnout in recent days.

The opening of early voting locations in Florida, Texas and elsewhere has piled millions of new votes on top of the mail ballots arriving at election offices as voters try to avoid crowded places on Nov. 3 during the coronavirus pandemic.

The result is a total of 58.6 million ballots cast so far, more than the 58 million that The Associated Press logged as being cast through the mail or at in-person early voting sites in 2016.

Democrats have continued to dominate the initial balloting, but Republicans are narrowing the gap. GOP voters have begun to show up as early in-person voting, a sign that many heeded President Donald Trump’s unfounded warnings about mail-voting fraud.

On Oct 15, Democrats registrants cast 51% of all ballots reported, compared with 25% from Republicans. On Sunday, Democrats had a slightly smaller lead, 51% to 31%.

The early vote totals, reported by state and local election officials and tracked by the AP, are an imperfect indicator of which party may be leading. The data only shows party registration, not which candidate voters support. Most GOP voters are expected to vote on Election Day.

Analysts said the still sizable Democratic turnout puts extra pressure on the Republican Party to push its voters out in the final week and, especially, on Nov. 3. That’s especially clear in closely contested states such as Florida, Nevada and North Carolina.

This is a glass half-full, glass half-empty situation, said John Couvillon, a Republican pollster who tracks early voting closely. They’re showing up more, he added, but Republicans need to rapidly narrow that gap.

In Florida, for example, Democrats have outvoted Republicans by a 596,000 margin by mail, while Republicans only have a 230,000 edge in person.

In Nevada, where Democrats usually dominate in-person early voting but the state decided to send a mail ballot to every voter this year, the GOP has a 42,600 voter edge in-person while Democrats have an 97,500 advantage in mail ballots.

At some point, Republicans have to vote, said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who tracks early voting on ElectProject.org.

You can’t force everyone through a vote center on Election Day. Are you going to expect all those Republicans to stand in line for eight hours?

Campaigns typically push their voters to cast ballots early so they can focus scarce resources chasing more marginal voters as the days tick down to Election Day.

That usually saves them money on mailers and digital ads — something the cash-strapped Trump campaign would likely want — and minimizes the impact of late surprises that could change the race.

Trump’s campaign has been pushing its voters to cast ballots early, but with limited success, delighting Democrats.

We see the Trump campaign, the RNC (Republican National Committee) and their state parties urging Trump’s supporters to vote by mail while the president’s Twitter account says it’s a fraud, Tom Bonier, a Democratic data analyst, said on a recent call with reporters.

The Twitter account is going to win every time. But Bonier warned that he does not expect a one-sided election. There are signs of Republicans being engaged, he said.

We do expect them to come out in very high numbers on Election Day. That split in voting behavior — Democrats voting early, Republicans on Election Day — has led some Democrats to worry about Trump declaring victory because early votes are counted last in Rust Belt battlegrounds.

But they’re counted swiftly in swing states such as Arizona, Florida and North Carolina, which may balance out which party seems ahead on election night.

Some of the record-setting turnout has led to long lines at early-vote locations and there have been occasional examples of voters receiving mail ballots that are incorrectly formatted. But on a whole, voting has gone relatively smoothly.

With more than one-third of the 150 million ballots that experts predict will be cast in the election, there have been no armed confrontations at polling places or massive disenfranchisement that have worried election experts for months.

One sign of enthusiasm is the large number of new or infrequent voters who have already voted — 25% of the total cast, according to an AP analysis of data from the political data firm L2. Those voters are younger than a typical voter and less likely to be white.

So far similar shares of them are registering Democratic and Republican.

They have helped contribute to enormous turnouts in states such as Georgia, where 26.3% of the people who’ve voted are new or infrequent voters, and Texas, which is expected to set turnout record and where 30.5% are new or infrequent voters.

The strong share of new and infrequent voters in the early vote is part of what leads analysts to predict more than 150 million total votes will be cast and possibly the highest turnout in a U.S. presidential election since 1908.

There’s a huge chunk of voters who didn’t cast ballots in 2016, Bonier said. They’re the best sign of intensity at this point.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/58pt5d/article32941159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDUSEARLYVOTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-elections-2020-gop-slowly-gaining-as-early-vote-total-surpasses-2016/article32941160.ece
43,2020/10/26,Church always a source of strength for me: Kamala Harris,"The vice presidential candidate has been spending quite a substantial amount of time in Michigan, a battleground state, which is headed for a tight race.

Democratic Party’s vice-presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris on Sunday said the church has always been a source of strength and a place for reflection for her.

Watch | Who is Kamala Harris?

“For me, the church has always been a source of strength and a place for reflection. And in my private conversations with God, I usually ask for strength and protection and guidance to do the right thing,” Ms. Harris said at a drive-in church service in Southfield, Michigan, which is right outside of Detroit,

“I know this isn’t how we usually do church but it is a reminder, pastor, that faith always finds its way,” she said referring to the unusual situation of the coronavirus pandemic.”

Ms. Harris, 56, said faith must be a verb.

“We must live it in our actions. That’s the kind of faith I was taught early on, pastor,” she said.

The vice presidential candidate has been spending quite a substantial amount of time in this battleground state, which like 2016, is headed for a tight race.

“I’m travelling around the country but I keep coming back to Detroit,” Ms. Harris said, noting the importance of the state’s most populated city in swinging statewide election results.

“You know, in 2016, right, we remember what happened? When we got hit by this natural disaster who’s now in the White House, right? In 2016, they won by just on an average two votes per precinct. Think about that — the power of the vote. So let’s make sure that doesn’t happen again, shall we? And that means: let’s make sure everybody votes,” Ms. Harris said.

“In 2016, it (margin of victory) was on average two votes per precinct. We know we can do better, and we know there is so much at stake, and we know the ancestors are relying on us to not let them down when there is so much at stake. So Detroit, I thank you, I thank you. Let’s bring this home! Let’s bring this home! Show the country and show the world that Detroit made the difference in this election,” she said.

At a separate campaign stop, she said there are lessons learned from the previous election.

“You guys are seriously going to make this happen. We all have PTSD from 2016, yes, but there are lessons from 2016, and one of them is that in 2016, in Michigan, we missed that election by, on average, two votes per precinct. Think about that,” she said.

“Like, this is doable! We can do this! We will do this! We’re gonna do this! We’re gonna elect Joe Biden the next president of the United States,” she added.

In her remarks,Ms. Harris reiterated that everything is at stake this election.

“Everything is at stake. Let’s look at the fact that we’re in the middle of a pandemic right now. One in 1,000 Black people in America has died from COVID. One in 500, it is estimated by the end of the year if they don’t get control of this, will die because of COVID. Black people are three times more likely to contract the disease, twice as likely to die from it, and it is not surprising that it has everything to do with longstanding racial disparities in all of these systems,” she said.

Ms. Harris alleged that all over this country, powerful people are trying to make it difficult for folks to vote.

“And you gotta ask, why are so many powerful people trying to suppress our vote, trying to confuse us about voting? Messing with the post office. Can you believe, messing with the Post Office?! Why are they doing all this? Because they know our power,” she said.

They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. So let’s not let anybody take our power from us, ever, she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ns3db9/article32941094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDKAMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/church-always-a-source-of-strength-for-me-kamala-harris/article32941095.ece
44,2020/10/26,Malaysia’s king rejects PM Yassin’s proposal to declare emergency,"Muhyiddin Yassin’s move has sparked national outrage, with critics slamming the move as an undemocratic means for him to hang on to power amid challenges to his leadership.

Malaysia’s king on Sunday rejected a proposal by embattled Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin to declare a state of emergency to fight a new outbreak of the coronavirus .

The plan by Muhyiddin, which involves suspending Parliament, has sparked national outrage, with critics slamming the move as an undemocratic means for him to hang on to power amid challenges to his leadership.

The palace said in a statement that Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah is of the opinion that there is currently no need for His Majesty to declare a state of emergency in this country or any part of Malaysia.”

Mr. Muhyiddin met with the monarch on Friday to seek royal assent but hasn’t made any public comment. The palace’s statement came after the king conferred with other royal households earlier Sunday to discuss the prime minister’s proposal.

Sultan Abdullah said the government has handled the pandemic well and believes that Mr. Muhyiddin is capable of implementing measures to cope with the crisis.

But the monarch called for a halt to all politicking” that could disrupt the government’s stability.

The king can declare a state of emergency that allows the country to be governed through ordinances that cannot be challenged in court.

Mr. Muhyiddin took power in March after instigating the cause of the former reformist alliance, but his government is shaky, with only a two-seat majority in Parliament.

Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has alleged that he has the support of a majority of lawmakers to topple Muhyiddin, but hasn’t managed to secure the monarch’s support.

‘Approval for budget’

Still, Mr. Muhyiddin faces a key test early next month when his government is due to seek approval for its 2021 budget in Parliament.

If he is unable to pass the bill, pressure will build for him to resign or call new elections. A state of emergency could allow him to delay that vote and consolidate support.

The king said there was no need for MPs to continue with irresponsible actions that can affect the stability of the government.”

He stressed that the budget is crucial in the fight against COVID-19 and to restore the economy, and urged Malaysians to unite to stem the virus’s spread.

Malaysia’s coronavirus cases doubled to more than 26,000 in just three weeks following a new outbreak, mainly in Sabah state on Borneo island.

Politicians from both sides of the divide as well as the Bar Council, the medical association and other groups have said there is no need for an emergency decree because there are sufficient laws to curb public movement and impose penalties to curb the virus.

Some also have warned that declaring an emergency could plunge the country into a dictatorship and ruin the economy.

Some media outlets have cited sources as saying that Muhyiddin wanted an economic emergency to merely suspend Parliament, without any curfew.

The last time emergency laws were invoked nationally was in 1969 during deadly racial riots.

Mr. Muhyiddin withdrew his party from Mr. Anwar’s reformist alliance that won 2018 elections and joined with the opposition to form a Malay-centric government in March. Then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad resigned in protest, saying he wouldn’t work with the corruption-tainted opposition that he ousted in 2018 polls.

Apart from Mr. Anwar, Mr. Muhyiddin also faces threats from the key ally in his ruling coalition, which is angry about being sidelined despite being the biggest party.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/i9826i/article32941076.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDMALAYSIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malaysias-king-rejects-pm-yassins-proposal-to-declare-emergency/article32941077.ece
45,2020/10/26,"Pope names 13 new cardinals, including 1st black U.S. prelate","In a surprise announcement from his studio window to faithful standing below in St. Peter’s Square, Francis said the churchmen would be elevated to a cardinal’s rank in a ceremony on Nov. 28.

Pope Francis on Sunday named 13 new cardinals, including Washington D.C. Archbishop Wilton Gregory, who would become the first black U.S. prelate to earn the coveted red hat.

In a surprise announcement from his studio window to faithful standing below in St. Peter’s Square, Francis said the churchmen would be elevated to a cardinal’s rank in a ceremony on Nov. 28.

Francis asked for prayers so the new cardinals may help me in my ministry as bishop of Rome for the good of all God’s faithful holy people.

The selection of Gregory won praise from LGBTQ advocates in the United States, days after Pope Francis grabbed headlines for voicing support for civil unions for gay couples.

Other new cardinals include an Italian who is the long-time papal preacher at the Vatican, the Rev. Raniero Cantalamessa, who is a Franciscan friar; the Kigali, Rwanda, Archbishop Antoine Kambanda; the Capiz, Philippines, Archbishop Jose Feurte Advincula, and the Santiago, Chile, Archbishop Celestino Aos Braco.

In 2010, while preaching at a Good Friday service attended by the then-pontiff Benedict XVI, Cantalamessa upset both Jewish and sex abuse survivors’ group when he likened allegations that the pope had covered up sex abuse cases against clerics to the more shameful aspects of anti-Semitism.

Also read: The Vatican tells bishops to report clerical abuse of minors to police

The Vatican quickly distanced Benedict from Cantalamessa’s remarks.

Another Franciscan who was tapped is Friar Mauro Gambetti, in charge of the Sacred Convent in Assisi.

The pope, when elected in 2013, chose St. Francis of Assisi as his namesake saint. Earlier this month, the pontiff journeyed to that hill town in Umbria to sign an encyclical, or important church teaching document, about brotherhood.

Gambetti was so surprised, at first he thought the pope was joking when he heard he was named, convent spokesperson the Rev Enzo Fortunato said.

Gambetti quickly pledged to put himself at the service of humanity at a time so difficult to us all, including offering compassion to the needy, Fortunato said in reference to the coronavirus pandemic.

In a reflection of the pope’s stress on helping those in need, Francis also named the former director of the Rome Catholic charity, Caritas, the Rev. Enrico Feroci, to be a cardinal.

The prestigious Washington archdiocese traditionally brings elevation to cardinal’s rank, so the appointment of Gregory, 73, last year by the pope had positioned him to be tapped for the honor.

Still, the timing of his rise to cardinal is noteworthy, coming in the thick of increased U.S. attention on racial injustice following the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minnesota this year.

Gregory was publicly critical of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to the St John Paul II National Shrine in Washington a day after civil rights demonstrators were forcibly cleared from a square to facilitate the president’s visit to an Episcopal church in the U.S. capital.

Conservative prelates in the United States have openly lambasted Francis for his more liberal stands, including his support for same-sex civil unions that came out in a new documentary this week.

Gregory said in a statement that becoming a cardinal would allow him to work more closely with the pontiff in caring for the Catholic Church.

While Gregory headed the Atlanta diocese earlier in his career, he wrote positively in a column about his conversations with Catholic parents of LGBTQ children.

An advocate for LGBTQ Catholics, Francis DeBernardo, told The Associated Press that choosing Gregory for a cardinal’s post signals Francis wants “LGBTQ people to be part of the church, and he wants church people to respect them.

DeBernardo linked the appointment to Francis’ recently reported comments supporting civil unions for same-sex couples.

He also praised the elevation to cardinal’s rank of a Vatican bishop who comes from Malta, a tiny, traditionally Catholic nation which has made significant progress in LGBTQ civil rights and protections in recent years.

DeBernardo was referring to Mario Grech, 63, who serves at the Vatican as secretary general of the Synod of Bishops office and who formerly headed the diocese on the Maltese island of Gozo.

Since naming cardinals also affects who the next pontiff will be, the Pope also shows that he is planning for the future of the church to continue in this affirming posture on issues of sexual orientation and gender identity, the U.S.-based DeBernardo said in a written statement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3w6qb9/article32941058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDGREGORY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pope-names-13-new-cardinals-including-1st-black-us-prelate/article32941059.ece
46,2020/10/26,Egyptians vote in second day of parliamentary elections,"The vote is likely to produce a toothless House of Representatives packed with supporters of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi

Egyptians on Sunday trickled into polling stations on the second day of voting for the country’s parliamentary election, amid a slight uptick in daily recorded coronavirus cases.

The vote is likely to produce a toothless House of Representatives packed with supporters of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi that further rubber-stamps his policies, leaving the former military general with almost unchecked powers.

A trickle of voters wearing face masks were seen in five polling stations visited by The Associated Press in the city of Giza, part of the Greater Cairo area and home to the famed Great Pyramids, with turnout relatively higher than Saturday’s vote.

Face masks are mandatory at polling centers, which were disinfected before and during the vote, authorities said.

Police forces, some armed, were also deployed outside polling centers, while others patrolled the streets. The government has deployed thousands of troops and policemen to safeguard the two-day vote.

A quota of 25% of the seats are reserved for women, according to constitutional amendments approved in a national referendum last year.

The current first stage of the vote for the lower chamber of parliament began a day earlier in 14 of Egypt’s 27 provinces, including Giza and the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria. About 33.5 million voters are eligible to participate in this stage.

Polls closed Sunday at 9 p.m. local time and elections authorities immediately began counting ballots. Official results of this stage are expected later this week.

The second stage is scheduled for Nov. 7-8 in the country’s 13 other provinces, including the capital Cairo and the restive Sinai Peninsula. The voting concludes with runoff elections.

A total of 568 seats in the lower chamber are up for grabs, with more than 4,000 candidates running as individuals competing for half of the seats. Prominent, wealthy government-affiliated power brokers have an advantage.

The other half of the elected seats in the five-year chamber are reserved for the more than 1,100 candidates running on four party lists. El-Sissi will name 28 seats, or 5%, bringing the total number of seats in the lower chamber to 596.

Some 63 million voters are eligible to vote in the Arab world’s most populous nation. The new chamber is expected to hold its inaugural session shortly after final results are announced in December.

Authorities urged Egyptians to take part in the vote in order to show a high turnout and lend legitimacy to the election. In remote areas like the Kharga Oasis in the western desert, local authorities provided free transportation to encourage people to cast their ballots.

The election commission vowed to enforce a law penalizing any boycotter with a fine of up to 500 Egyptian pounds ($32). In Aug., it said it would refer to prosecutors about 54 million people who did not vote in the recent Senate election.

Only 14.23% of voters participated in the election for the upper chamber, an advisory body with no powers, which was restored following a referendum last year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4wa2pd/article32941044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDEGYPT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/egyptians-vote-in-second-day-of-parliamentary-elections/article32941045.ece
47,2020/10/26,Singapore temporarily halts use of two flu vaccines after South Korea deaths,"No deaths associated with influenza vaccination have been reported in Singapore to date.

Singapore has temporarily halted the use of two influenza vaccines as a precaution after some people who received them in South Korea died, becoming among the first countries to publicly announce a halt of the vaccines' usage.

South Korea reported that 48 have died as of Saturday after getting flu shots, but said it would carry on with the state-run vaccination programme as they found no direct link between the deaths and the shots.

No deaths associated with influenza vaccination have been reported in Singapore to date, but the decision to halt the use of SKYCellflu Quadrivalent and VaxigripTetra was precautionary, the health ministry and the Health Sciences Authority (HAS) said in a statement late on Sunday.

The HSA is in touch with the South Korean authorities for further information as they investigate to determine if the deaths are related to influenza vaccinations.

SKYCellflu Quadrivalent is manufactured by South Korea's SK Bioscience and locally distributed by AJ Biologics, while VaxigripTetra is manufactured by Sanofi and locally distributed by Sanofi Aventis.

Two other influenza vaccines that have been brought into Singapore for the Northern Hemisphere 2020/21 influenza season may continue to be used, Singapore health authorities said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a9glko/article32512642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VACCINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/singapore-temporarily-halts-use-of-two-flu-vaccines-after-south-korea-deaths/article32941034.ece
48,2020/10/26,"New storm Zeta a hurricane threat to Mexico, US Gulf Coast","Zeta was the earliest named 27th Atlantic storm recorded in an already historic hurricane season.

Newly formed Tropical Storm Zeta strengthened Sunday in the western Caribbean and will probably become a hurricane before hitting Mexico’s resort-dotted Yucatan Peninsula and the U.S. Gulf Coast in coming days.

Zeta was the earliest named 27th Atlantic storm recorded in an already historic hurricane season.

The system was centered about 480 kilometers southeast of Cozumel island in Mexico at midafternoon, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.

The storm was nearly stationary, though forecasters said it was likely to shear the northeastern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula or westernmost Cuba by late Monday or early Tuesday and then close in on the U.S. Gulf Coast by Wednesday, but could weaken by then.

The storm had maximum sustained winds of 85 kph, and forecasters said Zeta was expected to intensify into a hurricane on Monday.

Officials in Quintana Roo state, the location of Cancun and other resorts, said they were watching the storm. They reported nearly 60,000 tourists in the state as of midweek. The government is still handing out aid, including sheet roofing, to Yucatan residents hit by Hurricane Delta and Tropical Storm Gamma earlier this month.

Zeta may dawdle in the western Caribbean for another day or so, trapped between two strong high pressure systems to the east and west. It can’t move north or south because nothing is moving there either, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy.

""It just has to sit and wait for a day or so,” Mr. McNoldy said. “It just needs anything to move.”

When a storm gets stuck, it can unload dangerous downpours over one place, which causes flooding when a storm is over or near land. That happened in 2017 over Houston with Harvey, when more than 150 centimeters of rain fell and 2019 over the Bahamas with a Category 5 Dorian, which was the worst-case scenario of a stationary storm, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.

While Zeta was over open ocean on Sunday, Jamaica and Honduras were getting heavy rains because the system is so large and South Florida was under a flood watch, Mr. McNoldy said.

But once Zeta eventually gets moving, it won’t be stalling over landfall, Mr. Klotzbach said.

The Hurricane Center said Zeta could bring 10 to 20 centimeters of rain to parts of the Caribbean and Mexico as well as Florida and the Keys before drenching parts of the central Gulf Coast by Wednesday.

A 2018 study said storms, especially in the Atlantic basin, are slowing down and stalling more. Atlantic storms that made landfall moved 4.7 kph slower than 60 years ago, the study found. Study author James Kossin, a government climate scientist, said the trend has signs of human-caused climate change.

Zeta is also in a dangerous place to stall. The western Caribbean is “where storms can cook” and rapidly intensify because of the deep, warm waters, like 2005’s Wilma, Mr. Klotzbach said. However, the National Hurricane Center was not forecasting rapid intensification for Zeta.

The lack of steering currents also meant wide spread of possible landfalls when Zeta eventually heads north to the Gulf Coast. The hurricane center said it could make landfall anywhere from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards urged his state’s citizens to monitor the storm, and the state activated its Crisis Action Team.

On Sunday, a hurricane watch was called for the Yucatan Peninsula from Tulum to Rio Lagartos, including Cancun and Cozumel, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Pinar del Rio, Cuba.

Zeta broke the record of the previous earliest 27th Atlantic named storm that formed November 29, 2005, according to Klotzbach.

This year’s season has so many storms that the hurricane center has turned to the Greek alphabet after running out of official names.

Zeta is the furthest into the Greek alphabet the Atlantic season has gone. There was also a Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005, but that year had 28 storms because meteorologists later went back and found they missed one, which then became a “unnamed named storm,” Mr. Klotzbach said.

Additionally, Hurricane Epsilon was moving quickly through the northern portion of the Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters said it would become a post-tropical cyclone later on Sunday. Large ocean swells generated by the hurricane could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along U.S. East Coast and Atlantic Canada during the next couple of days.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/c0tm4z/article32941037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TROPICALWEATHERTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-storm-zeta-a-hurricane-threat-to-mexico-us-gulf-coast/article32941036.ece
49,2020/10/26,"Venezuelan opposition politician Lopez arrives in Madrid, Spain says","Lopez, in a series of tweets earlier, said he had left Venezuela but did not disclose his location. He pledged to continue helping the political opposition from exile in their campaign to unseat President Nicolas Maduro.

Venezuelan opposition politician Leopoldo Lopez arrived in Madrid on Sunday, Spain’s foreign ministry said, after spending the past year at the Spanish ambassador’s residence in Venezuela to escape house arrest.

Lopez, in a series of tweets earlier, said he had left Venezuela but did not disclose his location. He pledged to continue helping the political opposition from exile in their campaign to unseat President Nicolas Maduro.

“Venezuelans, this decision has not been easy, but rest assured that you can count on this servant to fight from anywhere,” Lopez said. “We will not rest and we will continue working day and night to achieve the freedom that all Venezuelans deserve.”

In a statement, the Spanish foreign ministry said Lopez’s decision to leave the Spanish embassy in Venezuela was “personal and voluntary.”

Lopez’s party, Popular Will, did not say how he left Venezuela, but two people familiar with the matter said he travelled via Colombia.

Lopez was jailed in 2014 for leading violent protests against Maduro, and was released to house arrest in 2017. From his Caracas home, he was a mentor to opposition leader Juan Guaido, who early last year invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency and began a campaign to unseat Maduro.

In April 2019, when Guaido tried to spur a military revolt against Maduro, Lopez appeared on the streets alongside him. After the uprising fizzled, Lopez sought shelter at the Spanish ambassador’s residence. Lopez’s wife, Lilian Tintori, who had joined him at the residence, left for Spain that May.

Since then, Guaido’s campaign has struggled to maintain momentum, while authorities have detained dozens of his allies and Maduro has cemented his control over the military.

Venezuela’s government on Sunday accused Spain, in a statement, of aiding the “illegal escape of a dangerous criminal” in violation of international law and said authorities would investigate the “crimes committed.”

Following Lopez’s flight, intelligence agents arrested four Venezuelans who worked with Lopez in Caracas, including two of his bodyguards, according to Ana Leonor Acosta, a local lawyer who said she was contracted to defend the four individuals.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hi1duv/article32941022.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LEOPOLDOLOPEZ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/venezuelan-opposition-politician-lopez-arrives-in-madrid-spain-says/article32941023.ece
50,2020/10/26,Lithuanian centre-right opposition claims victory in general election,"The ruling Farmers and Greens party (LVZS), an agrarian group leading Skvernelis’ coalition, won 32 votes.

Lithuania’s main centre-right opposition Homeland Union party said it won the general election and will begin forming a new government with two smaller liberal parties, which together have a majority vote in the 141-seat parliament.

“At this moment it seems, that we will have a bit more than half votes in the parliament”, said Ingrida Simonyte, who would lead the government, told reporters.

Homeland Union, with roots in the 1980s anti-Soviet independence movement, won 49 seats and together with Liberal Movement and Freedom Party were on track for a majority of 73 votes in the 141-seat parliament, according to provisional results.

The ruling Farmers and Greens party (LVZS), an agrarian group leading Skvernelis’ coalition, won 32 votes.

The leader of LVZS, Ramunas Karbauskis, conceded defeat, telling reporters: “If we no longer need to pull the cart that we’ve been pulling, our lives will get better”.

The Baltic Sea state of less than 3 million people has fared relatively well in the coronavirus crisis, though cases have spiked of late as elsewhere around Europe.

But Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis has faced criticism for failing to create more jobs and stop debt mounting.

“The biggest immediate issue for the new government will dealing with the COVID outbreak, whether it is brave enough to impose an immediate lockdown”, said Kestutis Girnius, an associate professor at Vilnius Institute of International Relations and Political Science.

The new government is unlikely to change foreign or defence policy, but will be more pro-business and is unlikely to keep increasing social payouts, he added.

Simonyte was finance minister in a previous Homeland Union government, which lost power in 2012 after one of Europe’s harshest austerity programmes, which caused a collapse in GDP of about 15% in 2009.

51,2020/10/26,Chileans flock to polls in referendum for change,"Voting is no longer compulsory in Chile, and turnout reached only 50% for the 2018 election of the country’s billionaire president, Sebastian Pinera.

Chileans flocked to the polls Sunday in a referendum on whether to change a dictatorship-era constitution seen as underpinning the nation’s glaring inequalities.

In long, orderly lines across Santiago and in cities around the country, masked voters shuffled patiently towards polling stations to participate in a historic referendum many hoped would finally bury the constitution left by the 1973-1990 regime of Augusto Pinochet.

“People voting, all over, and so many young people. You didn’t see them voting in the presidential election, but you see them today,” said taxi driver Jose Gallardo, who ferried people to polling stations from early morning.

Voting is no longer compulsory in Chile, and turnout reached only 50 percent for the 2018 election of the country’s billionaire president, Sebastian Pinera.

Pinera called on Chileans to turn out in numbers after he cast his ballot early in the upmarket Las Condes area of the capital.

“Tonight when we learn the results, whatever the outcome may be, let’s respect people’s choice and make a firm and clear stand for democracy and not anarchy, for peace and not violence, for unity and not division,” he said.

Police fired tear gas and water cannon in clashes with around 50 stone-throwing demonstrators in Plaza Italia, the epicenter of the social protests, in the late afternoon.

The vote comes a year to the day after more than one million people thronged downtown Santiago amidst a wave of social unrest that left 30 people dead and thousands wounded.

The sheer size of the October 25 march demonstrated the breadth of social discontent and proved a tipping point in demonstrators’ demands for a referendum.

Within weeks, Pinera had agreed to initiate a process to draft a new constitution, beginning with a referendum to decide the fate of the current text.

Pinera, 70, has not come out publicly for either side in the campaign, and his conservative coalition is divided on the issue.

“I am full of hope that things will change and that we will bring a radical turnaround in this country,” said Romina Nunez, 42, a poll organizer at the National Stadium in Santiago, the country’s biggest polling center.

Thousands were voting at the vast stadium, which achieved infamy as a detention center where military regime opponents were tortured.

Elias Perez, a 39-year-old psychologist, said he wanted to give the place another meaning as he prepared to vote for change in a place rich with symbolism.

“To be able to exercise the right to vote in a space of profound pain, where there were systematic violations of the human rights of many fellow Chileans, and be able to generate change in this same space -- is a symbolic way of paying honor and tribute to all those who are no longer with us,” he said.

What may change

Demand for a new constitution had been a recurring theme of the protests, set off by a hike in public transport fares. They rapidly turned into widespread demonstrations against social and economic inequalities -- encompassing health, education and pensions -- inherited from Pinochet’s rule.

For those supporting change, mainly the leftist opposition parties, a new charter would allow a fairer social order to replace the persistent inequalities enshrined in the current charter.

Critics say the constitution is an obstacle to meaningful social reforms, and a new one is necessary to provide more equitable access to private health care, education and pension systems.

The new constitution would expand the role of the state in providing a welfare safety net, ensuring basic rights to health, education, water distribution and pensions.

Many conservatives, however, say the constitution has been key to Chile’s decades of economic growth and stability and a greater state role would add pressure on an economy struggling to emerge from the Covid-19 health crisis.

They say their fears have been fueled by the violence that accompanied the protests.

Support for new constitution

Chileans are asked two questions on the ballot papers: to approve or reject a new constitution, and if necessary, what kind of body should draft it -- a mixed assembly composed equally of lawmakers and citizens, or a 155-member convention made up entirely of citizens.

Opinion polls show more than 70 percent support a new constitution, with just 17 percent voting for rejection.

Polls also indicate similar backing for a constituent all-citizen convention, to be elected in April 2021.

Their draft would be put to another referendum in 2022.

Strict coronavirus protocols were in place for the vote. Voters had their hands sprayed with gel by marshalls as they entered polling stations, and tables, chairs and other furniture inside had been disinfected.

52,2020/10/26,Tear gas fired as thousands mark one year of Iraq protests,"Protesters marched in the capital and several southern cities - including Najaf, Nasiriyah and Basra - to renew demands for an end to corruption by Iraq’s political establishment.

Thousands of people took to Iraq’s streets on Sunday to mark one year since mass anti-government demonstrations swept the country, with police firing tear gas in central Baghdad to stop protesters from crossing strategic bridges and both sides reporting injuries.

Protesters marched in the capital and several southern cities - including Najaf, Nasiriyah and Basra - to renew demands for an end to corruption by Iraq’s political establishment.

When dozens of protesters attempted to scale cement barriers on Jumhuriya and Sinak bridges, security forces fired tear gas to disperse the crowds.

Some protesters hurled Molotov cocktails, injuring at least 43 security forces, said Yahya Rasool, a military spokesman for the prime minister.

At least six protesters were also wounded, according to an security and medical officials, who requested anonymity in line with regulations.

The demonstrations Sunday were considered a test of the movement’s strength following months of inactivity on the street. Despite reaching historic numbers in late 2019 and successfully mounting pressure on elites, the protests have been largely dormant in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Activists also blamed the drop in numbers on a violent crackdown by Iraqi security forces and militia groups, as well as kidnappings and targeted assassinations.

The renewed protests were also a test for Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, just five months in power. Al-Kadhimi has been vocal about his support for the protester’s demands. His government came to power following the resignation of Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi late last year. He stepped down under pressure from protests sparked by security forces’ heavy-handed response, including the use of live rounds and the killing of demonstrators.

More than 500 people were killed during the months-long protest movement, many of them demonstrators shot by Iraqi security forces.

The current administration cannot afford to do the same, al-Kadhimi’s advisors have said. The government is also grappling with a severe liquidity crisis amid low oil prices that has slashed state coffers by half.

Mustafa Hussein, in his 20s, participated in the demonstrations last year and returned to Baghdad’s Tahrir Square on Sunday. He said little had changed.

""Our demands that we wrote with the blood of our martyrs are still on the lists of officials, without implementation,” he said.

The bridges across the Tigris River where clashes broke out lead to the heavily fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies. Both bridges have been closed off by security forces since last year to prevent protesters from storming across. They were again fortified in the days leading to Sunday’s protest, with a heavy security presence on the streets.

In Baghdad’s Tahrir Square, which has been the epicenter of the protest movement, Iraqi youth carried banners with portraits of those killed by Iraqi security forces. In some cases, tear gas cannisters struck the heads of demonstrators, killing them instantly.

""Today we mark the memory of the October Revolution, especially those fallen,” said Fadel Ahmed, 25, a graduate of economics. “Our demands are against corrupt parties in power and against the failed parliament.”

In October of last year, tens of thousands of Iraqis - mostly young people - marched in Baghdad and cities in the south to decry government graft, unemployment and poor services. Demonstrators took over public squares in Baghdad and camped out for months, refusing to leave until their demands were met.

The movement had early successes. Al-Kadhimi, the current prime minister, has presented himself a champion of the protesters’ demands, appointing long-time activists among his close group of advisors. In prerecorded address Saturday night, he promised that early elections - a key demand of protesters - would be held next June.

Despite the crackdowns from militias and the government, protesters say their movement is still alive.

53,2020/10/26,U.S. insists on need to ban TikTok,"The filing comes as the court considers the legality of the administration's bid to make the Chinese-owned app unavailable in the United States, where it has 100 million users.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has insisted on the need to ban TikTok due to national security concerns in a new court filing ahead of a plan to make the video app unavailable on November 12.

The filing comes as the court considers the legality of the administration's bid to make the Chinese-owned app unavailable in the United States, where it has 100 million users.

“The president should not be prevented from regulating national security threats simply because a foreign adversary cloaks its activities within a media company,” the filing on Friday at a federal court in Washington says.

The Trump administration is seeking to persuade the judge in the case to allow it to move forward with restrictions on the video-sharing app, which it claims has links to the Chinese government through its parent firm ByteDance.

In September, a temporary injunction prevented the government from removing TikTok from mobile application download platforms.

That Trump administration order had sought to ban new downloads of the app but continue to allow use of TikTok until November 12, when all usage would be blocked.

The judge at the time denied TikTok's request to suspend the November 12 ban, but the court has yet to consider the merits of the legal arguments on whether the social platform should remain available to Americans.

TikTok has repeatedly defended itself against allegations of data transfers to the Chinese government.

It says its servers where user information is stored are located in the United States and Singapore.

The company has also said the ban is unnecessary since negotiations are underway to restructure the ownership of TikTok to address national security issues raised by the administration.

A tentative deal has been unveiled that would make Silicon Valley giant Oracle the technology partner for TikTok and a stakeholder in a new entity to be known as TikTok Global.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/m3t4m3/article32940999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-US-IT-LIFESTYLE-RACISM-TIKTOK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-insists-on-need-to-ban-tiktok/article32941000.ece
54,2020/10/26,U.S. announces new Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire as fighting persists,"The announcement comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday met with foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan in Washington.

The United States on Sunday said a new humanitarian ceasefire will take effect on Monday in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, even as fresh fighting erupted between the two sides who blame each other for the failure of previous truces.

The ceasefire is due to take effect at 8 a.m. local time (12 a.m. EDT) on Oct. 26, the U.S. State Department and the governments of Azerbaijan and Armenia said in a joint statement.

“Congratulations to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who just agreed to adhere to a cease fire effective at midnight. Many lives will be saved,” U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter.

The announcement came after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held separate meetings with the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan in Washington on Friday.

“Those meetings were joined by the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group, formed to mediate the conflict and led by France, Russia and the United States, which described them as “intensive discussions” on the ceasefire and the beginning of talks about core elements of a comprehensive solution.

The Minsk Group said its co-chairs and the foreign ministers agreed to meet again in Geneva on Oct. 29.

But the eruption of new fighting on Sunday and the collapse of two previous ceasefires brokered by Russia raised questions about the prospects for this fresh push to end the clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh, a part of Azerbaijan populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.

The fighting that broke out on Sept. 27 over the disputed territory has surged to its worst level since the 1990s, when some 30,000 people were killed.

Local officials in Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday accused Azeri forces of firing artillery on settlements in the areas of Askeran and Martuni during the night. Azerbaijan said its positions had been attacked with small arms, mortars, tanks and howitzers.

Armenia accused Azeri forces of shelling civilian settlements. Baku denied killing civilians and said it was ready to implement a ceasefire, provided Armenian forces withdrew from the battlefield.

The defence ministry of the Nagorno-Karabakh region said on Sunday it had recorded another 11 casualties among its forces, pushing the military death toll to 974.

Earlier on Sunday during a meeting with defense officials, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev accused Armenia of bombarding civilian sites and launching two ballistic missiles on the city of Ganja.

Armenian President Armen Sarkissian accused Baku of being ”aggressively stubborn and destructive”.

World powers want to prevent a wider war that draws in Turkey, which has voiced strong support for Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.

Differences over the conflict have further strained relations between Ankara and its NATO allies, with Pompeo accusing Turkey of fuelling the conflict by arming the Azeri side. Ankara denies it has inflamed the conflict.

Sarkissian, in comments reprinted by the Armenpress news agency, called on “global players” to step in immediately to bring about a ceasefire and said Russia was “a trusted and pro-active mediator” between the conflicting sides.

Aliyev said it was “very hazardous” for Armenia to want Russian military support in the conflict and third parties should not get involved militarily.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he speaks to leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan several times a day by phone, and that he hopes the United States will help Moscow broker a solution to the conflict.

55,2020/10/26,Chileans vote to replace Pinochet-era Constitution,"78.28% back the reform campaign

Chileans voted overwhelmingly in a landmark referendum on Sunday to replace their dictatorship-era Constitution, long seen as underpinning the nation’s glaring economic and social inequalities.

The result set off wild celebrations across the capital and other cities after voters threw out the constitution left by the regime of 1973-1990 dictator Augusto Pinochet.

Thousands of people flocked onto the streets of Santiago amid a cacophony of horn-blaring to celebrate a crushing victory for the “Approve” campaign — by 78.28% to 21.72 with over 99% of the votes counted.

“I never imagined that us Chileans would be capable of uniting for such a change!” said a jubilant Maria Isabel Nunez, 46, as she walked in the crowd hand-in-hand with her 20-year-old daughter.

Acknowledging the result, President Sebastian Pinera called on the nation to work together for a “new constitution” in a speech broadcast from his Moneda Palace surrounded by his cabinet.

“This plebiscite is not the end, it is the beginning of a path that we must all walk together to agree on a new constitution for Chile,” Mr. Pinera said.

“Until now, the constitution has divided us. From today we must all work together so that the new constitution is the great framework of unity, stability and the future.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chileans-vote-to-replace-pinochet-era-constitution/article32947217.ece
56,2020/10/26,U.S. Presidential Elections 2020 | Biden blasts Trump as COVID-19 cases mount and Pence staff endures outbreak,"While numerous COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, none has been approved for use in the United States.

Vice President Mike Pence forged ahead with campaigning on Sunday despite a COVID-19 outbreak among his aides and President Donald Trump claimed progress as the United States set records for daily infections, prompting Democratic challenger Joe Biden to accuse Trump of surrendering to the pandemic.

With nine days to go before the Nov. 3 election in which Mr. Biden is facing the Republican president, the White House cited Mr. Pence’s status as an “essential worker” as justification for his campaign travel despite exposure to his chief of staff, Marc Short, who tested positive on Saturday.

Multiple senior aides to Mr. Pence also tested positive for COVID-19, the White House chief of staff said.

The United States in the past two days has registered its highest number of new COVID-19 cases - about 84,000 on Friday and about 79,900 on Saturday. The pandemic, which has killed about 225,000 people in the United States and left millions of Americans jobless, remains front and center in the presidential race.

While Mr. Pence was set to campaign in North Carolina later on Sunday, Mr. Trump addressed a rally at an airport in New Hampshire.

Even as the novel coronavirus surged in many parts of the United States, Mr. Trump told the rally: “There’s no nation in the world that’s recovered like we’ve recovered.”

“We are coming around, we’re rounding the turn, we have the vaccines, we have everything. Even without the vaccines, we’re rounding the turn,” Mr. Trump told cheering supporters, many not wearing protective masks or observing social-distancing recommendations. “It’s going to be over. And you know who got it? I did. Can you believe it?”

While numerous COVID-19 vaccines are being developed, none has been approved for use in the United States.

“We’re not going to control the pandemic. We are going to control the fact that we get vaccines, therapeutics and other mitigation areas,” White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told CNN’s “State of the Union” program.

In a statement released by his campaign, Mr. Biden seized on those comments, saying Meadows “stunningly admitted this morning that the administration has given up on even trying to control this pandemic, that they’ve given up on their basic duty to protect the American people.”

“This wasn’t a slip by Meadows, it was a candid acknowledgement of what President Trump’s strategy has clearly been from the beginning of this crisis: to wave the white flag of defeat and hope that by ignoring it, the virus would simply go away. It hasn’t, and it won’t,” Mr. Biden added.

The outbreak among Mr. Pence’s aides marked the latest White House COVID-19 cases, which have included Mr. Trump, first lady Melania Trump, their son, Barron, and numerous aides and associates. The president was hospitalized for three nights this month after contracting COVID-19.

The new infections offered a reminder of the way Mr. Trump and his allies have downplayed the advice of public health experts to wear masks and observe social-distancing guidelines to combat COVID-19 transmission.

Trump heads to Maine

Mr. Trump also is due to campaign in Maine on Sunday. Mr. Biden had no campaign events scheduled for Sunday. Mr. Biden leads in national opinion polls, but contests in battleground states that could decide the outcome appear closer. About 58.8 million voters already have cast ballots.

Meadows told reporters that White House doctors cleared Mr. Pence to travel after Short tested positive. Mr. Pence is scheduled to address rallies in Kinston, North Carolina, later on Sunday and in Hibbing, Minnesota, on Monday. Meadows said Mr. Pence would continue to campaign and speak at rallies.

A spokesman for the vice president said late on Saturday that Mr. Pence and his wife had tested negative.

Asked why Mr. Pence was not following U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to quarantine for 14 days after such exposure, Meadows on Sunday cited the vice president’s status as “essential personnel.”

CDC guidance states: “To ensure continuity of operations of essential functions, CDC advises that critical infrastructure workers may be permitted to continue work following potential exposure to COVID-19, provided they remain asymptomatic and additional precautions are implemented to protect them and the community.” The CDC guidance does not mention political campaigning.

Explaining why the Trump campaign is not requiring people attending rallies to wear masks, Meadows said the campaign offered masks to attendees, but “we live in a free society.”

Mr. Biden’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, took four days off the campaign trail this month after an aide tested positive for COVID-19.

Speaking in Detroit, Ms. Harris criticized Mr. Pence for continuing to travel, saying: “He should be following the guidelines.”

Mr. Trump has mocked Mr. Biden for wearing a protective mask.

Infectious diseases expert Dr. Sandra Nelson of Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital said it appeared that Mr. Pence would be at high risk for becoming infected and transmitting infection.

“With multiple members of his office testing positive, this would be considered a work-based cluster. Anytime there is a cluster like this, I would advise that the entire office transition to remote work for 14 days,” Nelson said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/m5dzgi/article32940980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020BIDEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-elections-2020-biden-blasts-trump-as-covid-19-cases-mount-and-pence-staff-endures-outbreak/article32940981.ece
57,2020/10/26,Polish protesters disrupt church services over near-total abortion ban,"A Constitutional Court decision outlawing abortions due to foetal defects has now triggered four days of demonstrations.

Thousands of activists disrupted church services across Poland on Sunday, chanting during mass and spraying slogans on walls to protest against a court ruling that amounts to a near-total ban on abortion.

In the first large-scale demonstrations directly targeting churches in the predominately Catholic country, crowds carried posters depicting a crucified pregnant woman and handed out protest cards to priests.

A Constitutional Court decision outlawing abortions due to foetal defects has now triggered four days of demonstrations.

The ruling ended the most common of the few legal grounds left for abortion in Poland and set the country further apart from the European mainstream.

In southern city of Katowice, a 7,000-strong crowd of mostly women gathered in front of the cathedral, chanting “this is war” and “human law, not ecclesiastical law”. State news agency PAP said police used tear gas after officers were attacked.

Three dozen protesters interrupted a mass in the western city of Poznan, chanting “we are sick of this” and holding banners with slogans including “Catholic women also need their right to abortion” in front of the altar.

“Our rage should be directed towards politicians, but also towards senior church figures as they have also added to this women's hell that the authorities are preparing,” said Mateusz Sulwinski, one of the protest organizers in Poznan.

The leaders of the protests have accused Poland's conservative ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), of pressing the court to tighten restrictions to appeal to the party's base and to please the influential Church. The party denies that.

Church leaders have also denied wielding political power.

“The Church does not constitute the law in our homeland and these are not the bishops who decide on the compliance or non-compliance of laws with the Polish Constitution,” Polish archbishop Stanislaw Gadecki said in a statement.

“However, the Church cannot stop defending life, nor can it abandon the proclamation that every human being must be protected from conception until natural death.”

A spokesman for the government could not be reached for comment.

In Krakow, protesters hung black underwear and clothes on lines between trees - a reference to early protests against tightening of abortion restrictions where people wore black to show their support.

In Warsaw protesters sprayed “abortion without borders” on one church, according to state news agency PAP. At another church “you have blood on your hands” was daubed on the wall.

Some people give priests cards with a bolt symbol symbolising their protest instead of the traditional donation during mass.

“I'm here today because it annoys me that in a secular country the church decides for me what rights I have, what I can do and what I'm not allowed to do,” said media worker Julia Miotk, 26, protesting in front of a church in Warsaw.

The protests started on Thursday despite bans on gatherings of more than five people imposed to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Activists said they were planning more protests on Monday afternoon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g08q6f/article32940968.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POLAND-ABORTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/polish-protesters-disrupt-church-services-over-near-total-abortion-ban/article32940969.ece
58,2020/10/26,France reacts to boycott calls; Erdogan ups Macron insults,"A day after saying that Macron needed his head examined for condoning caricatures of the prophet of Islam, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that the French leader has “lost his way.”

French authorities denounced Turkish “propaganda” against France that they said was aimed at fanning hate at home and abroad, and asked on Sunday for calls to boycott French products cease immediately, saying such attacks were the work of a “radical minority.”

Meanwhile, the president of Turkey took a second insulting swipe at French President Emmanuel Macron in a growing, potentially high-risk dispute.

A day after saying that Mr. Macron needed his head examined for condoning caricatures of the prophet of Islam, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that the French leader has “lost his way.”

In an unusual move, France announced Saturday it was recalling its ambassador for consultations.

The French Foreign Ministry said in a statement Sunday evening that its diplomats were mobilizing to ask countries where boycotts were being organized or hate calls issued not to back them, and to provide assurances that French citizens would be safe.

“In numerous countries of the Middle East, calls to boycott French products...and more generally, calls to demonstrate against France, in sometimes hateful terms, have been relayed on social media,” the French Foreign Ministry said. It added that such calls “denature” France’s positions on freedom of expression and conscience.

Meanwhile, Pakistan and a bloc of Muslim nations condemned, without using insults, remarks by Mr. Macron last week in which he refused to condemn the publication or showing of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad.

France considers religious satire to be among the kinds of speech that fall under the freedom of expression, while many Muslims consider any perceived attack on their prophet as a grave offense. An 18-year=old of Chechen origin beheaded near Paris on Oct. 16 a teacher who had shown caricatures of Muhammad in class.

While eulogizing the teacher, Mr. Macron said last would that France will not renounce its freedoms.

The Turkish leader criticized his French counterpart during a party congress on Saturday, questioning the state of Mr. Macron’s mental health. The French presidency reacted with indignation, but Mr. Erdogan did not back off.

“The person in charge of France has lost his way,” Mr. Erdogan said Sunday. “He goes on about Erdogan while in bed and while awake. Look at yourself first and where you’re going. I said yesterday...he is a case, and he really must be examined.”

The evening statement by French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian denounced “hateful and slanderous propaganda against France showing a wish to fan hate against us and among us,” an apparent reference to potential reaction from France’s Muslim population, the largest in Western Europe.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan tweeted on Sunday that Mr. Macron chose “to encourage Islamophobia by attacking Islam rather than the terrorists” and “to deliberately provoke Muslims, including his own citizens.”

The 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, headquartered in Saudi Arabia, on Friday condemned the “ongoing practice of running satirical caricatures depicting the Prophet Muhammad” and “will continue to decry justification for blasphemy of any religion in the name of freedom of expression.”

Unlike Turkey, the organization had earlier condemned the slaying of the French teacher. Samuel Paty, was beheaded while leaving school in a Paris suburb. The 18-year-old suspect in the killing, who had become radicalized, was shot to death by police.

The teacher’s gruesome slaying, which is being investigated as an act or terrorism, came as the French government works on a planned law to fight “separatism,” notably Islamist radicals that Mr. Macron claims have created a parallel universe countering French values.

“What is the problem of this person called Mr. Macron with Islam and Muslims?” Mr. Erdogan, a devout Muslim, asked rhetorically Saturday during his Justice and Development party meeting in the central Anatolian city of Kayseri.

It was the latest episode in a string of increasingly bitter differences between Paris and Ankara that are fraying ties between the two NATO allies. Mr. Macron’s office said on Saturday that Mr. Erdogan’s policies are “dangerous.”

The French presidential office noted in its statement Saturday announcing the recall of its ambassador Turkey’s call for a boycott of French products. The move, if taken to heart, could add a layer of economic ramifications to the deepening diplomatic tussle.

Exiled opposition figure Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya on Sunday called on Belarusians to begin a nationwide strike after police forces loyal to veteran President Alexander Lukashenko fired stun grenades to disperse mass protests.

Ms. Tsikhanouskaya had previously set a “People’s Ultimatum” for Mr. Lukashenko to resign by Sunday night, promising to call the strike if he did not.

Mr. Lukashenko, who has ruled for more than a quarter of a century, has signalled he would ignore the ultimatum.

“The regime once again showed Belarusians that force is the only thing it is capable of,” Ms. Tsikhanouskaya wrote in a statement. “That’s why tomorrow, Oct. 26, a national strike will begin.”

It was not immediately clear how many Belarusians would answer her call. But in a show of opposition strength, tens of thousands marched through Minsk and other cities on the 11th straight weekend of mass protests since a disputed election.

Police used stun grenades against protesters they headed towards Independence Palace in the capital.

People carrying the red-and-white flags of the Belarusian opposition movement scattered as loud bangs and flashes lit up the city’s streets after nightfall, videos showed.

An interior ministry spokeswoman said it was too early to say how many people had been injured or detained. “We will only know by the morning if there are any injured people,” Olga Chemodanova was cited by RIA as saying.

Earlier on Sunday, crowds streamed through the capital shouting “strike”, waving flags and beating drums.

60,2020/10/26,Coronavirus | Spain announces new state of emergency as infections soar,"Catalonia was one of the first regions on Sunday to use the new legislation to impose a curfew, which will take effect at 10 p.m.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced a new state of emergency on Sunday in an effort to curb soaring coronavirus infections, imposing local night time curfews and banning travel between regions in some cases.

The measures go into force from Sunday night and will require all regions except the Canary Islands to impose a night time curfew and limit the number of people allowed to meet to six.

“We are living in an extreme situation ... it is the most serious health crisis in the last century,” he told a news conference following a cabinet meeting.

Catalonia was one of the first regions on Sunday to use the new legislation to impose a curfew, which will take effect at 10 p.m. Establishments open to the public will have to close at 9 p.m.

Police were patrolling the city before the curfew took effect and locals welcomed the new rule.

“I believe that in a certain way a measure had to be taken because everything was getting a little out of control,” said vocational training teacher Paula. “I think more measures will come, but it's a good start.”

Other regions that announced curfews from Sunday night included Cantabria and La Rioja.

Spain imposed one of the toughest lockdowns early on in the pandemic and then relaxed curbs over the summer.

But like many other European countries it has seen a second wave hit in recent weeks, and now has one of the highest numbers of infections in Western Europe. Total cases rose to 1,046,132 on Friday, while the death toll is nearing 35,000.

The state of emergency will need parliamentary approval to last beyond 15 days. Sanchez asked for parliament to approve its extension up to May 9.

A growing number of regions had been calling on the government to implement the measure.

The Madrid region had already limited the number of people who could meet inside homes to six, as well as banning the mixing of different households overnight.

Canary Islands vice president Roman Rodriguez tweeted he was ”satisfied” the tourist hotspot had been excluded from the curfews but encouraged people not to let their guard down.

The islands hope to save their tourist season after the UK and Germany decided last week they were no longer a travel risk.

The decree will serve as a legal framework to implement a new warning system of levels, similar to the ones already applied in countries such as Germany and France.

According to the level of risk, travelling between regions could be banned if a regions decides, except for justified reasons such as working. Movement could also be restricted within regions in localised lockdowns.

Most of the regions are already above the parameters to be considered at the highest level of risk.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tj381d/article32940926.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SPAINPRIMEMINISTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-spain-announces-new-state-of-emergency-as-infections-soar/article32940927.ece
61,2020/10/26,Drawing attention to wildlife threats with humour and art,"Attempting to save the planet by drawing funny comics about the environment: Rohan Chakravarty draws attention to climate change, wildlife threats and the splendours of nature with generous doses of humour and gorgeous art.

Here is an excerpt from“Drawing Doomsday”, a chapter in the book “10 Indian Champions Who Are Fighting to Save the Planet” by Bijal Vachharajani and Radha Rangarajan published by Penguin.

With sixty lakh visitors annually, Guwahati’s taxi drivers are used to strange requests from tourists. But one found himself stumped. Cartoonist Rohan Chakravarty hopped off the aircraft and booked a taxi straight to the local municipal garbage dump. “It was to see Guwahati’s Greater Adjutant Storks, that have made the dump their home,” he explained. “Never in my life have I seen a more perplexed taxi driver.”

Follow Rohan Chakravarty's work in The Hindu here.

It’s not only in Assam that Rohan finds humour and beauty in dire situations. It’s all in a day’s work for Rohan, who creates environment and wildlife cartoons under the name Green Humour. Whether it’s hornbills or Polar Bears, politicians or environmentalists, turtles or elephants, they’ve all been given a humorous twist by his pen.

From dentures to green adventures

The only memory that Rohan has of his childhood scribbles is drawing rain and leopards. “While my love for leopards is unchanged,” said Rohan, “I’ve grown up into somewhat of a hydrophobe! If only watching frogs and snakes weren’t a thing of the monsoon!”

What helped to inspire his interest in wildlife was that he and his brother Rohit, a chiropterologist (someone who studies bats), grew up on a steady diet of encyclopaedias and picture books that their grandfather gifted them—so they knew about ocelots and matamatas by the age of three!

Rohan studied to be a dentist. “I have never been a bright student, particularly of subjects I dislike,” he explained. “Dentistry fit into that bill. My mother has stood by every decision I have made in my life, except getting into dental college, and was very relieved when I made the switch to animation (initially) and later cartooning; she always knew that medicine wasn’t for me.”

When you ask Rohan what prompted him to move from molar to solar power, he responds with a perfect nature analogy. “In the winter of 2014, a kittiwake, a seabird not found in the Indian subcontinent, landed up on the coast of Maharashtra. It was a straggling vagrant, probably blown in by unpredictable winds, and obviously had no idea what it was doing in the Konkan coast. I too, was as aimless in my teenage years as that kittiwake. It was only when I met my first wild tigress that the kittiwake in me “kitti-woke” up, and decided to merge two dormant passions—wildlife and cartoons—and spring into action.”

While Rohan’s mother was secretly pleased, his father had his reservations. Wildlife cartooning did not seem like a viable career choice. There are few cartoonists such as Patrick McDonnell, creator of the iconic series “Mutts”, who have managed to carve a name for themselves in this niche. And in India, most cartooning is political. But Rohan’s father quickly changed his mind, when a former patient confessed that the denture his son had made for her didn’t fit her.

When Rohan started out in around 2010, it was difficult to get publishers and readers to take cartoons on wildlife seriously. But he feels that readers have become more receptive over time. “I don’t know whether I should be thankful for this or not, but the fact that environmental issues are now so grave that they occupy the forefront of many minds, and this has helped my series gain the attention it needed,” he said.

Rohan did not study to be a naturalist. “There was a point in my life where I really wanted to become a wildlife scientist,” he said. “But I soon realised that I did not have the patience to wait for an owl to poop so I could dissect its pellets. I think that my aversion to academics (and a staple diet of Yash Chopra films) has helped keep the romance in me alive, something that’s very necessary for being an artist of any kind.” The way he sees it, rather than drowning animals in formalin to study them, he’d rather draw them to learn more about different species.

Field visits have helped him understand how cultural differences shape local conservation practices. For example, Neilingding, a military island that he visited in south-eastern China, has a designated sanctuary for an animal that most Indians have at least once had their kitchens raided by — the Rhesus Macaque!

Seriously funny stuff

Most environmental sciences books are very earnest when they talk about the planet’s diverse flora and fauna (well, it is a very serious subject). Newspaper reports about climate change, deforestation and wildlife crimes are frightening enough to make anyone want to curl up into a ball like a threatened pangolin, and environment policymakers often seem out to disprove their name.

People shy away from bad news (and there is enough of that around) so humour is a powerful weapon to make people engage with climate change.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/j1anax/article32942535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20smlead12jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/drawing-attention-to-wildlife-threats-with-humour-and-art/article32942531.ece
62,2020/10/26,The lazy dragon,"Little Slothy wouldn’t practice breathing fire, and flying high and fast. How on earth were his parents going to get him to do so?

“Get up, Slothy. Don’t you want to join your siblings in learning how to breathe fire?” wondered the mother dragon. “Please, mummy, let me sleep in just a little more. I know how to breathe fire,” muttered Slothy, turning the other way.

Slothy loved to sleep, watch television, and play games on his mobile phone. What he did not enjoy was learning anything: from breathing fire, to building stamina to fly fast and far. Slothy’s parents encouraged and motivated him, but he was a little couch potato.

One day, Slothy’s mother pushed him to go outdoors to get some fruit from the forest. Reluctantly, he agreed. The trees were dense, the flowers were pretty, the birds were chirping and the earthy smells were refreshing. But Slothy just wanted to get back to his TV show.

At the campfire

Plodding through, he arrived at a clearing, where some children were enjoying themselves around the campfire.

“Wow, a dragon! Are you a real dragon?” they called.

“Of course. I am a fire-breathing dragon,” said Slothy proudly.

“We’ll believe you when you blow out fire for us,” said one child disbelievingly.

“Here you go,” and Slothy puffed. But nothing happened. He tried again, but again, no fire. “You’re not a real dragon,” the children taunted him.

“But, see, I can fly.” Slothy flapped his wings and lifted himself just a little above the ground. Plonk, he fell right down.

“Little dragon, don’t fool us. Learn to blow fire and fly, and then come back to us,” the children chuckled.

With tears rolling down his cheeks, Slothy returned home and locked himself in his room. He felt humiliated. He decided that he would learn to be a real fire-blowing and flying dragon.

From that day, he diligently learnt all that his father taught his siblings and practised hard. In the beginning, he couldn’t breathe fire, but his father reminded him that only with regular practice would he learn to breathe fire, and soar high and fast. Sometimes, he made mistakes or failed at a task, but he continued to try repeatedly.

One day, while collecting fruits for his family, Slothy reached the same camp site. This time, there were two families who looked upset. Slothy went closer to see what the matter was. A little girl yelled out “Look, a fire-breathing dragon. He could help us!” They had forgotten to bring their matches and couldn’t cook on the campfire.

Help at hand

Slothy said that he could surely help. He mustered up his strength and puffed once. There was a spark but not quite enough. Slothy remembered his father’s teachings and took a moment to collect his thoughts and focus on the task. This time, when he puffed, he blew out a hot stream of fire on the logs and lit the camp fire. The little girl and other campers thanked Slothy. They roasted their marshmallows and had a great time.

Seeing them so happy, Slothy was elated. Waving goodbye, he soared high in the sky, realising that practice indeed makes perfect.",,https://www.thehindu.com/children/q5wbhg/article32940964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30YTTALESPIN-1,https://www.thehindu.com/children/the-lazy-dragon/article32940966.ece
63,2020/10/26,Polish city names square after Harivansh Rai Bachchan,"Amitabh Bachchan took to Instagram and posted a picture of a signboard of the square in the city of Wroclaw embossed with his father’s name.

Amitabh Bachchan says he is thrilled that the city of Wroclaw in Poland has named a square after his late father and celebrated poet, Harivansh Rai Bachchan.

The 78-year-old actor took to Instagram on October 25 and posted a picture of a signboard of the square embossed with Harivansh Rai Bachchan’s name.

“The City Council of the City of Wroclaw, Poland has decided to name a Square after my Father. There could not have been a more apt blessing on Dushhera than this. A moment of extreme pride for the family, for the Indian community in Wroclaw and India. Jai Hind (sic),” he captioned the picture.

In July, students of the University of Wroclaw had paid homage to the Hindi poet by reciting his popular poem ‘Madhushala’.

In 2019, Amitabh Bachchan visited Poland where his father was honoured at one of the oldest churches of the country.

“At one of the oldest Churches in Europe, in Poland a prayer for Babuji. So touched and such an emotional moment, his soul must be at peace and love. Thank you Bishop and the people of Poland, such an honour,” the screen icon had tweeted.

Harivansh Rai Bachchan, a poet of the Nayi Kavita literary movement of early 20th century, received the Padma Bhushan in 1976 for his service to Hindi literature.

66,2020/10/26,Objects found in Perambalur tank are not dinosaur eggs: report,"Amid claims in the social media that dinosaur egg fossils have been unearthed in Venkattan kulam, an irrigation tank at Kunnam in Perambalur district, a report prepared by the Curator of Government Museum, Tiruchi, indicates that the stone ball-like objects were concretions and a few of them were found to be ammonites.

Ammonite is a marine organism that existed centuries ago and the coating with sediments and minerals makes it into a rock-like object, C. Sivakumar, Curator (in-charge), Government Museum, Tiruchi, who carried out an inspection on October 23 following a direction from the Commissioner of Museums, Chennai, said.

Mr. Sivakumar was accompanied by Uma Shankar, Curator (in-charge) Ariyalur Fossils Site Museum and Kunnam Tahsildar during the inspection.

During the course of the inspection, stone ball-like objects of varying sizes were found in the tank. The objects were found when dredging works were being undertaken in the sprawling waterbody. The objects were mild yellow in colour and found at a depth of 20-feet from the ground, said Mr. Sivakumar.

Mr. Sivakumar said close examination of the upper portion of the objects at the site revealed they were all concretions that could have been formed centuries ago. Inspection of the upper layer of three big-size concretions that were flat, indicated that they were ammonites.

71,2020/10/26,UEFA Champions League | Messi up against a likely Ronaldo-less Juventus,"Chance for Chelsea to unleash Fab Four; Bayern looking unstoppable

The highly anticipated match-up of Cristiano Ronaldo against Lionel Messi, when Barcelona visits Juventus in its Group G encounter, likely won’t happen because the Portuguese has the coronavirus.

Juventus has not reported many details of Ronaldo’s status but the forward has not played since appearing for Portugal earlier this month and isn’t expected to be named to the Bianconeri’s squad.

Could this be the week Chelsea manager Frank Lampard finally unleashes his very own Fab Four — a four-man frontline comprising Christian Pulisic, Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech behind lone striker Timo Werner?

A mixture of injuries and rotation meant this has yet to happen, but the option is there for Lampard in Chelsea’s match at Krasnodar on Wednesday. Both Chelsea and Krasnodar are seeking a first win after drawing their opening Group E matches against Sevilla and Rennes, respectively.

Injuries plague City

Manchester City would simply like to get a striker on the field against Marseille in Group C on Tuesday, but it is unlikely. Sergio Aguero, just back from a long-term knee injury, sustained a muscle problem against West Ham in the Premier League on Saturday and joins fellow striker Gabriel Jesus on the sidelines again.

For all his evident talent, Neymar is having a worrying lean spell in Europe’s elite competition.

The star forward has not scored in his last four Champions League games, having squandered chances galore during the Final Eight in Lisbon and in last week’s 2-1 home defeat to Manchester United in Group H.

That loss has PSG under some early pressure, and Neymar’s performance was widely criticised.

The match at Turkish side Istanbul Basaksehir on Wednesday is likely to be a physical encounter and Neymar, who has already been sent off this season, will have to keep his cool.

Zidane’s demand

Zinedine Zidane wants Real Madrid to play with the same intensity the team showed in its win over Barcelona in the Clasico on Saturday.

Madrid visits Borussia M’Gbach in Group B on Tuesday and is seeking to bounce back from a surprise opening home loss to Shakhtar Donetsk. Eden Hazard was added to the Madrid squad and could make his season debut after nursing a muscle injury.

Rebound needed

Atletico Madrid and Luis Suarez are also looking to rebound. Diego Simeone’s side was thrashed 4-0 by defending champion Bayern Munich and next hosts Salzburg in Group A on Tuesday.

Bayern’s biggest challenges seem to be how to maintain its outstanding form and meet its own burgeoning expectations.

Former I-league champion team Chennai City FC (CCFC) and head coach Akbar Nawas have mutually parted ways. The announcement was made on Monday through the cub’s social media. “CCFC would like to thank Akbar for his exemplary contribution to the club. We wish the very best for his future endeavours. We would like to thank Akbar for our long-standing collaboration,” read the message on Twitter.

CCFC owner Rohit Ramesh lavished praise on Akbar. “Akbar Nawas was instrumental in putting us on the Indian footballing map and we hope he joins us soon in the future and wish him the best,” he tweeted.

Satisfying time

Akbar said that his stint with CCFC has been quite an enduring one.

“My time with CCFC has been a satisfying one professionally and personally. Together we achieved great things. Won the I-league, qualified for the AFC Cup and produced players of the highest quality many of whom are now playing in the National team and in key clubs in ISL,” he tweeted.

“Unfortunately all good things should come to an end. I will always carry my time with CCFC in my heart with great fondness. Lastly, I would like to thank the entire management [of CCFC] — the players and specially Rohit Ramesh — whose guidance and assistance have been of utmost importance. The CCFC fans deserve a special mention, they are just great.”

Akbar took over from head coach V. Soundararajan in March 2018 — he was earlier CCFC’s technical director — after the team had finished eighth in the 2017-18 season.

In his first full season, CCFC became the I-league champion.

73,2020/10/26,Premier League | Vardy header gives Leicester first win at Arsenal in 47 years,"The win lifted Brendan Rogers' side to fourth on 12 points, while the Gunners stay in 10th place on nine after six games.

Leicester City won at Arsenal for the first time in 47 years on Sunday, with substitute Jamie Vardy's late close-range header enough to secure victory in the Premier League at The Emirates.

The win lifted Brendan Rogers' side to fourth on 12 points, while the Gunners stay in 10th place on nine after six games.

Arsenal were left ruing their failure to score in the first half hour when they pushed forward time and again, racking up 10 shots and six corners to Leicester's one and zero respectively.

They had the ball in the net from a corner in the fourth minute but replays showed at least three players offside as Alexandre Lacazette flicked it past keeper Kasper Schmeichel.

The hosts then almost scored when Kieran Tierney whipped in a cross that captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed over.

They went even closer to opening the scoring a few minutes later when Alexandre Lacazette, standing in front of goal, somehow nodded another cross from Tierney wide of the far post.

Vardy, who came on with half an hour to play having missed Leicester's previous two games with a calf injury, broke the deadlock in the 80th minute, heading home Cengiz Under's cross.

“We weathered a bit of a storm but then started getting into it and we've come away with a win. It's big for us but it's just the next game where we want to keep improving,” said Vardy.

The win gets Leicester's season back on track following league defeats by Aston Villa and West Ham United.

“Weve had a couple of bad results and we wanted to put that right in the league. Luckily, Ive come on and made an impact,” Vardy told Sky Sports.

“It gives us a little boost. The last two games in the league have not been good enough but to come here and put in a performance like we have is great for the team.”

Vardy's 11th Premier League goal against the Gunners - more than any other player apart from Wayne Rooney - gave his side their first win at Arsenal since September 1973.

74,2020/10/26,Data | 72% of registered Indian American voters plan to vote for Biden: survey,"Significant share of respondents feel Democrats manage U.S.-India better

Nearly three out of four respondents of a recent survey* of U.S. citizens of Indian origin said they are planning to vote for the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. This contradicts an emerging narrative that Indian Americans are moving away from the Democratic Party due to close ties between U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the report said.

A majority of those surveyed 'strongly disapproved' of Trump's handling of his job. The share of respondents who felt that Democrats manage U.S.-India relations better was twice the share of those who felt Republicans manage ties better. Intolerance towards minorities was the reason most respondents gave for not identifying with the Republican Party.

Biden much ahead in support

Only 22% of registered Indian American voters plan to vote for Trump, while 72% intend to vote for Biden.

78,2020/10/26,Future shrugs off Amazon challenge,"Not party to agreement cited by Amazon, says Future Retail; ‘deal with Reliance enforceable under law’

A day after Amazon.com Inc. secured an interim order from Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) restraining Future Retail Ltd. (FRL) and Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. (RRVL) to go ahead with their ₹24,713 crore assets acquisition deal, Future Retail said it was not party to the agreement under which Amazon has invoked arbitration proceedings and it would proceed with the proposed transaction ‘unhindered’ without any delay.

RRVL has also said that it would enforce its rights without delay. “The company has received a communication from the SIAC, enclosing an interim order of the Emergency Arbitrator in the arbitration proceedings under shareholders’ agreement between Amazon, Future Coupons Private Ltd. and the promoter group,” Future Retail informed the BSE.

“The company is examining the communication and the order. It may be noted that the company is not a party to the agreement under which Amazon has invoked arbitration proceedings,” it said.

“All relevant agreements are governed by Indian law and provisions of Indian Arbitration Act... and this matter raises several fundamental jurisdictional issues which go to the root of the matter. Accordingly, this order will have to be tested under the provisions of Indian Arbitration Act in an appropriate forum,” FRL said in a regulatory filing.

“In any enforcement proceedings, FRL would take appropriate steps to ensure that the proposed transaction will proceed unhindered without any delay,” it added.

In a statement issued late Sunday, RRVL, the subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), said, “the rights and obligations are fully enforceable under Indian law.”

Soon after the order, an Amazon spokesperson said, “We are grateful for the order which grants all the reliefs that were sought. We remain committed to an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration process.”

“SIAC’s decision to put a stay on the sale of Future Group’s consumer business to RIL is unlikely to impact the latter’s credit profile, given its position as the leading retailer in India and its strong financial position.” Sweta Patodia, analyst, Corporate Finance Group, Moody’s Investors Service, said.

‘May delay retail plans’

“Nonetheless, the decision will likely delay RIL’s plans to expand its retail footprint in India,” she added.

Drugmaker Aurobindo Pharma has reached a definitive agreement to sell Natrol LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aurobindo Pharma USA Inc., to private equity firm New Mountain Capital and its affiliate Jarrow Formulas.

The all-cash transaction is valued at $550 million (₹4,048 crore at the current exchange rate), Aurobindo Pharma intimated the stock exchange Monday morning. The transaction is expected to close by January.

Aurobindo Pharma had acquired the assets of Natrol in December 2014. “Natrol has been a consistently profitable business, growing on all fronts under Aurobindo’s ownership,” the company said. “Natrol’s annual sales for the 12 months ended March 31, 2020 was about $157 million,” it added. The net worth of Natrol as on March 31 was $82.41 million.

“We are pleased to sell the Natrol business to an outstanding private equity player, who could focus additional resources to grow Natrol, its products and brands further,” Managing Director N. Govindarajan said.

The proceeds from Natrol’s divestiture will be used to reduce debt and for other new strategic initiatives. he said.

80,2020/10/26,Aiming to make CG Power debt-free in 5 years: TII,"‘Exports, services are growth drivers’

Tube Investments of India (TII) Ltd., which recently received the Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) nod to acquire CG Power and Industrial Solutions, has set a five-year target to make the latter a debt-free firm, said a top TII official.

“We see significant growth drivers such as exports, new product development and service revenues in the existing business,” S. Vellayan, MD, TII, said during an analyst call. “In the five-year time frame, we will also make the company debt-free.”

CG Power had total debt of ₹2,161 crore, out of which TII benefited from a haircut of ₹1,100 crore of original debt as of March 2020. CG Power has a restructured term loan of ₹650 crore, a very low coupon NCD of ₹200 crore, and a ₹150 crore balance sheet item, to be adjusted from sale of company property. On the funding, he said the acquirers were looking at it as an adjustment of debt and equity infusion. Clearly, reducing the company’s debt will continue to be an important metric for the Murugappa Group, the MD said.

“We will be able to get the company to a strong level of performance in a very short period of time,” he said.

“Our broad belief is that over 4-5 years, we should be able to get the company to a ₹5,000 crore topline with ₹500 crore PBT,” Mr. Vellayan said.

According to him, the motors business will end up being almost half of that, while railways and switch gears will be in the range of around ₹1,000 crore each. Transformers business might be about ₹500 crore. Other new businesses might contribute an additional ₹500 crore.

During FY19, the company reported standalone revenue ₹5,620 crore, which dropped to ₹3,169 crore in FY20 and due to the lack of working capital. The number will continue to contract into FY21 as well. Things might improve during FY22, he said.

Asked about the rationale for acquisition, he said TII adopted a three-pronged strategy — organic business, a VC-style approach to medium-term growth and an inorganic approach to acquire companies and turning them around.

The latest buy helps TII to de-risk from the auto business, which is cyclical in nature. Secondly, it went well with TII’s core stability of manufacturing high-quality industrial products, and were quite different from the current line of products, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/62p9i3/article32947313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27BUVELLAYANSUBBIAH,https://www.thehindu.com/business/aiming-to-make-cg-power-debt-free-in-5-years-tii/article32947314.ece
81,2020/10/26,OPEC hopeful fresh lockdowns will not dent energy demand,"‘Govts. should modify response to another wave of pandemic’

The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is hoping that lockdowns and curfews in some countries in the event of a second or third wave of COVID-19 infections will not dent global energy demand as much as in the second quarter of this year when the world was virtually in lockdown mode.

The OPEC is keeping a ‘very close’ watch on the fresh surge of COVID-19 infections in Europe, prompting fresh lockdowns in some countries, as well as the virus’s trajectory in India and America. “We were hopeful that the second half of 2020 would begin to see a recovery in the global economy as well as energy and oil demand… there were projections of a V-shaped recovery,” said OPEC secretary general Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo. “Unfortunately, both economic growth as well as demand recovery remain anemic at the moment, due largely to the virus spread,” he said.

“We remain hopeful that governments around the world, having learned the lessons of what transpired in the second quarter of 2020 and the consequences of the lockdowns on the global economy and society, would try to modify their responses and measures in the event of a second or third wave of infections,” Mr. Barkindo said at the India Energy Forum on Monday evening.

“We don’t expect a relapse to the massive contraction [in oil demand] that we saw in the second quarter,” the senior OPEC official stressed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/xxz5kc/article32947263.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27BUOPEC1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/opec-hopeful-fresh-lockdowns-will-not-dent-energy-demand/article32947264.ece
82,2020/10/26,Author Sarbpreet Singh’s latest book is on the Sikh massacre of 1984,"‘Night of the Restless Spirits’ is author Sarbpreet Singh’s recounting of the Sikh massacre of 1984

Like most Indians who were not in Delhi during those three fateful days in November 1984, Sarbpreet Singh considered any account of the massacre as an instance of civil unrest blown out of proportion.

“Even though I had to bunk in a friend’s hostel room for two days to avoid miscreants, I considered it a stray incident,” says Sarbpreet, who was a 24-year-old engineering student, at the time.

Despite mounting evidence that pointed to the contrary, Sarbpreet like everyone else, refused to believe a genocide had actually taken place.

“It was only a couple of years later, when I was in the United States and read accounts by the People’s Union for Civil Liberties and the People’s Union for Democratic Rights, that the enormity of what had transpired began to dawn on me. The fact that the documentation was undertaken by non-Sikhs who had nothing to gain added to its credibility.”

Responding to the turmoil in his heart, Sarbpreet penned Kultar’s Mime, a poem that captures the trauma of children who witnessed their parents being butchered. Written in 1990, Kultar’s Mime was resurrected in 2014 by Sarbpreet’s daughter, J Mehr Kaur, who adapted it for the stage. It ran to packed houses for two years in over 90 countries, including India.

“The feedback we got was terrific. People were grateful the play provided them with a platform to address their trauma, to open up about their own experience of this incident which they had never shared with a spouse or child before this,” says Sarbpreet, over a phone call from his home in Massachusetts.

The overwhelmingly positive response to Kultar’s Mime encouraged Sarbpreet to revisit his notes, which resulted in Night of the Restless Spirits. The book is a fictionalised version of real happenings comprising just eight chapters. Not for the faint-hearted, Night of the Restless Spirits, shows the events of 1984 through the prism of many lives and explores its far-reaching impact on members of the community as well as on non-Sikhs associated with them.

“It was difficult to write,” admits Sarbpreet. “It was hard to delve into the complexities of these events and strike a nuanced balance.”

Though the pogrom of 1984 is not ancient history, it has been successfully pushed under the carpet for decades. “There was never an incentive for any party to talk about it — neither the perpetrators who allowed things to get out of hand nor the victims who had always identified themselves as warriors and defenders of the weak, throughout India’s history.”

As cathartic as the process of writing this book was, Sarbpreet hopes above all else that the book stirs up the vestiges of humanity that he believes lie dormant in his fellow men. “There is an increasing intolerance towards those who are different. I hope Night of the Restless Spirits mitigates the numbness that society has against minorities; that the voices of the stifled and subdued are given a just hearing, that we learn from the past and such horrors are not repeated.”

With this book, Sarbpreet Singh touches on the fragility of life, survivor’s guilt, mob mentality and the power of one’s conscience as well its fickleness, to bring out the best and worst of human nature.

84,2020/10/26,Centre promises law to check stubble burning,"SC stays order on monitoring panel

The Centre will bring in a law, via ordinance, to address air pollution as well as check stubble burning in Delhi as well as the surrounding National Capital Region, the Supreme Court was informed on Monday.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Court that a draft legislation would be ready this week following which the Court suspended its earlier decision to have a one-man committee led by former Justice Madan Lokur to monitor stubble burning, exacerbating the region’s noxious air.

Also read: Punjab sees sharp rise in stubble burning

“The new law is for tackling air pollution in NCR and adjoining areas. It’s an ordinance,” Secretary in the Ministry of Environment R.P. Gupta told The Hindu.

However, there appeared to be no consultation so far with the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) regarding the proposed legislation. With an increase in stubble burning — the burning of rice straw by farmers to clear their fields for winter sowing in Punjab and Haryana — the MoA has in recent years been tasked with funding the use of subsidised combine harvesters and other machinery to dissuade farmers from burning.

Also read: Stubble burning: Centre to test decomposer technology

“The new ordinance is coming from the Environment Ministry and so far no consultations have been held with Agriculture Ministry officials,” said a person in the Minstry aware of inter-ministerial coordination activities to check stubble burning.

The Delhi NCR already has a Graded Response Action Plan, which is overseen by the Environment Pollution Authority, that has specified a number of measures that governments must take — from banning diesel gensets to restricting vehicle movement — depending on the degree of pollution.

Also read: ‘We will make liquid solution to stop stubble burning’

To check stubble burning this kharif (summer) season, the Punjab government has appointed 8,000 nodal officers in villages that grow paddy. Over 23,000 crop residue management machines are being given to farmers for on-site management of straw.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh last week appealed to farmers not to burn crop residue because the practice could aggravate the conditions leading to the spread of COVID-19, besides causing pollution. He said the State was taking measures to sensitise the farmers to the problem and it had been pressing the Centre to give ₹100 per quintal to farmers for managing the paddy straw without burning it.

However, Executive Director, Centre for Science and Environment Anumita Roychowdhury said new legislation was not the need of the hour.

“We don't yet know what this proposed law will be about. There are strong laws in place for checking pollution but inadequate infrastructure at the level of State and municipal bodies to implement them. The existing laws could be sharpened no doubt. But what we need now is better enforcement,” she told The Hindu.

With the monsoon withdrawing and winter-conditions setting in, air quality in the Delhi-NCR has been deteriorating since last week and dipped to 'poor and very poor' on the air quality index.

According to forecasting system, SAFAR, maintained by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the contribution of stubble burning to the worsening air quality was 16% on Monday relative to other sources such as road dust, vehicular emissions and industrial activities. Pollutants from straw burning are brought in by the wind. Instances of burning, or fire counts, as they are called and tracked via satellite, have increased in the last few weeks and increased to nearly 1,200 as of Monday.

Central Pollution Control Board officials have said adverse meteorological conditions — a drop in wind speed and lowering of the mixing height (at which pollutants disperse), led to pollutants remaining trapped in the air.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1sgyqr/article32947669.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STUBBLEBURNING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-promises-law-to-check-stubble-burning/article32947670.ece

The southwest monsoon is likely to completely withdraw from the country by Wednesday and northeast monsoon rains to begin over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, coastal Andhra Pradesh and parts of Kerala and Karnataka, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday.

“The southwest monsoon has further withdrawn from some more parts of Gangetic West Bengal; most parts of Jharkhand; some parts of Odisha; remaining parts of Chhattisgarh; some parts of coastal Andhra Pradesh and Telangana; entire Vidarbha; remaining parts of Madhya Pradesh; some parts of Marathwada, Madhya Maharashtra and Konkan and remaining parts of Gujarat and north Arabian Sea today, October 26, 2020 ... it is likely to withdraw from the entire country around October 28, 2020,” it said in a statement.

The Railway Board has directed its vigilance officials to follow due diligence while investigating cases by giving an opportunity to suspect employees to give their version.

The advisory follows a mistake in one of the Zonal Railways where an official who had no locus standi in a case was “erroneously” included in the investigation report along with others sent to the Central Vigilance Commission.

‘Lax’ attitude

After the CVC recommended major punishment against the official, the railway authorities realised that he had no role to play in the composite vigilance case. When the matter was reverted, the CVC expressed displeasure for adopting a “lax” attitude during processing of the case, sources in the railways said on Monday.

To avoid recurrence of such instances, it is advised that the version of suspect official should normally be taken during investigation for arriving at an objective conclusion. “The process of obtaining response affords an opportunity to the suspect official to explain his/her stand and might clarify the differences in understanding, perception and interpretation of issues,” the Railway Board said in a note to all Senior Deputy General Managers/Chief Vigilance Officers of Zonal Railways, Production Units, Public Sector Undertakings etc.

All investigating officials were directed to demonstrate due diligence during staff accountability exercise and after thorough scrutiny only cases should be submitted to the Vigilance Directorate of the Railway Board for further action.

Expeditious disposal

In a separate advisory, the Railway Board said the CVC had advised all Chief Vigilance Officers to ensure expeditious finalisation of disciplinary proceedings/action, particularly in respect of officials likely to retire from service shortly.

Chief Justice Bobde said the court was concerned about the peace and harmony of the society. There had to be responsibility in reportage. There were some areas which had to be covered with caution.

The case concerned the registration of criminal cases against Mr. Goswami by the Mumbai police for allegedly inciting communal hatred with his remarks on air in connection with the Palghar lynching case and the crowding of migrant workers at the Bandra railway station in violation of the pandemic lockdown in April. The Bombay High Court had suspended the investigation for lack of a prima facie case against him. The Maharashtra government had appealed the High Court decision.

Mr. Salve said the FIR was not “genuine.” He said any press coverage of communal or criminal violence today leads to registration of FIR under Section 153A (communal hatred) of the Indian Penal Code.

But Chief Justice Bobde said “you do not always have to conform to the mores of the day ... You can be a little old-fashioned.”

Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, for Maharashtra, said the State would not take any coercive action against Mr. Goswami and would issue summons 48 hours prior to calling him, etc.

“You are entitled to ask questions, but you cannot unnecessarily harass,” the CJI told Mr. Singhvi.

The senior lawyer said the court should not send a message across that “some people are above the law.”

“While none are above the law, some may need additional protection as they may feel they are targeted with some intensity,” the CJI reacted.

“Some people should not think they are the ‘Island of the Republic’,” Mr. Singhvi replied.

In his turn, Mr. Salve said not only his client but his entire editorial staff were threatened with criminal proceedings. “This is a joke going on in that State,” the senior lawyer objected.

The CJI said a member of the media could not interpret protection afforded to his profession to mean “nobody can ask me a question.”

“Nobody is immune from questioning. Questioning can be done with due respect to dignity and privacy ... We want some assurance of responsibility from you,” the CJI addressed Mr. Salve.

88,2020/10/26,"Court live-streaming could be abused, says CJI","Attorney General Venugopal had pushed for it, saying everyone can then watch the court

Attorney General of India K.K. Venugopal on Monday pushed for live-streaming court proceedings to make hearings accessible to all.

But Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, heading a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court, sounded a cautionary note, saying it was susceptible to “abuses.”

The exchange came on a day when the Gujarat High Court live-streamed its court hearings. “Live-streaming should be something on My Lords’ minds... Everyone can then watch the court,” the Attorney General submitted.

Mr. Venugopal reminded the Supreme Court of its own judgment of September 2018 in favour of “opening up” the apex court through live-streaming. The judgment has remained unimplemented. Mr. Venugopal hinted that the pandemic offered a fresh opportunity.

“There are problems which should not be discussed publicly... There are certain abuses... We will take a decision soon enough, otherwise successive Chief Justices [turning to Justice D.Y. Chandrachud who is in line to be CJI] will do,” said Chief Justice Bobde.

Open court system

Justice Chandrachud was one of the three judges on the Bench that gave the verdict on live-streaming in September 2018. In fact, he had noted in his separate opinion that live-streaming of proceedings would be the true realisation of the “open court system.” Mr. Venugopal had assisted that Bench as amicus curiae. His suggestions were later adopted as guidelines in the September 2018 judgment.

The issue of live-streaming came up as a Special Bench led by the CJI was taking stock of the virtual court system initiated soon after the pandemic lockdown. Chief Justice Bobde said the courts required access to the fibre optic network to ensure better connectivity even in the remotest parts of the country. The Chief Justice said the north-eastern parts could be connected via satellite.

At this point, senior advocate Harish Salve came on to suggest the Jio network.

“HCs can frame rules”

Justice Chandrachud, on the Bench along with Justice L. Nageswara Rao, said each high court can make its own rules itself and trial courts under it for the virtual court system. Uniform rules for all high courts would prove difficult, considering the difference in connectivity and e-literacy.

On April 6, the Supreme Court had upheld the virtual court system and deemed all restrictions imposed on people from entering, attending or taking part in court hearings as lawful in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rrjzeg/article29985071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BOBDEData,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/court-live-streaming-could-be-abused-says-cji/article32946968.ece
89,2020/10/26,Modi govt. using organs of State to target Opposition: Sonia Gandhi,"Every pillar of democratic governance is under assault, she alleges in her opinion piece

Congress president Sonia Gandhi has accused the Narendra Modi government of using every organ of the State to target the Opposition, stifling dissent by branding it as “terrorism” and “anti-national” and treating dissenters and political opponents as “second class citizens without democratic rights.”

Her comments, in an article published on Monday, comes a day after her Dussera message to citizens in which she said rulers should not have “arrogance, resort to falsehood or break promises made to the people.”

In her opinion piece, Ms Gandhi said every pillar of democratic governance was under “assault” and the Police, the Enforcement Directorate, the Central Bureau of Investigation, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and even the Narcotics Bureau now “dance only to the tune of the Prime Minister and Home Minister’s Office.”

“The BJP may have differences with dissenters and civil society activists. Indeed, the same activists have often protested against Congress governments as well. But to paint them as anti-national conspirators promoting communal violence is prejudicial and extremely dangerous for democracy,” she said.

Ms. Gandhi mentioned how the government targeted activists who were protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register for Citizens and lodged more than 700 FIRs against them.

The Congress president said the rights of the citizens do not end with the right to vote, as fundamental rights also allow freedom of expression and the right to dissent and protest peacefully.

“The Prime Minister repeatedly claims to represent 130 crore Indians. But his government and the ruling party are treating political opponents, dissenters, and those who did not vote for the ruling party as second-class citizens without democratic rights. The people of India are not just an electorate. They, and only they, are the nation,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ebjoy/article31332126.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk--sonia-gandhi-pti,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-govt-using-organs-of-state-to-target-opposition-sonia-gandhi/article32946842.ece
90,2020/10/26,"Anti-cow slaughter law in U.P. being misused, says High Court","“Seized meat often not sent for analysis... some stuck in jail for offence that may not have been committed”

The Allahabad High Court has expressed concern at the misuse of anti-cow slaughter law in Uttar Pradesh.

“[U.P. Prevention of Cow Slaughter] Act is being misused against innocent persons,” the court noted, as it granted bail to Rahmuddin, a person from Shamli accused of cow slaughter.

The petitioner was booked in May under Section 3, 5 and 8 of the Act in Thana Bhawan police station of Shamli. There were no charges against the petitioner in the FIR, said the court.

Counsel for the petitioner also informed the court that he was not arrested from the spot, but he had been in jail since August 5.

“Whenever any meat is recovered, it is normally shown as cow meat [beef] without getting it examined or analysed by the Forensic Laboratory. In most of the cases, meat is not sent for analysis,” said Justice Siddharth.

In an order dated October 19, the court observed that some continue to be in jail for an offence that may not have been committed at all, or was triable by a Magistrate Class I and carried a maximum sentence of up to 7 years. The judge said whenever cows were shown as recovered, no proper recovery memo was prepared and one did not know where the cows went after the recovery. Goshalas did not accept non-milching or old cows and they were left to wander on the roads.

Similarly, after milking the cows, owners allow them to roam on the roads, drink drainage or sewer water and eat garbage and polythene, the court added.

“Whether cows are on roads or in the fields, their abandonment adversely affects the society in a big way. Some way out has to be found to keep them either in the cow shelters or with the owners, if U.P. Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act is to be implemented in letter and spirit,” the court said.

It ordered the release of the applicant on bail on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties of a like amount to the satisfaction of the court.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/akaj0r/article32946856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THSHELTER-COW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/anti-cow-slaughter-law-in-up-being-misused-says-high-court/article32946857.ece

A London court on Monday rejected the bail application filed by fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi, the seventh such rejection by courts of the United Kingdom, officials said here.

Modi, who is wanted in connection with the ₹13,000 crore Punjab National Bank fraud perpetrated by him and his uncle Mehul Choksi, was arrested in London on March 19 last year on CBI’s extradition request, they said.

“The repeated rejection of bail application is a result of excellent coordination among the CBI, External Affairs Ministry and Crown Prosecution Service of the United Kingdom,” a senior official of the agency said.

His four previous attempts to get bail were rejected by District Judge in Westminster Court of London last year on March 20, March 29, May 8 and November 6.

Modi’s two attempts to get bail from the High Court in London were also rejected on June 12, 2019 and March 5, 2020, they said.

His seventh application came before the Westminster court on Monday which was also rejected, the CBI said.

92,2020/10/26,2+2 Ministerial dialogue | India to sign geo-spatial cooperation BECA with U.S.,"A maritime information agreement is also under discussion between the two countries

India and the U.S. will sign the last foundational agreement, Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geo-Spatial cooperation (BECA) during the 2+2 ministerial dialogue on Tuesday, the Defence Ministry said in a statement on Monday.

“The two Ministers expressed satisfaction that agreement of BECA will be signed during the visit,” the Ministry said in a statement after bilateral talks between Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and U.S. Secretary of Defence Mark Esper. Both Mr. Esper and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in the national capital on Monday.

The two Ministers reviewed bilateral defence cooperation spanning “military-to-military cooperation, secure communication systems and information sharing, defence trade and industrial issues” and also discussed ways to take bilateral cooperation forward, the statement said. Stating that they discussed potential new areas of cooperation both at the Service-to-Service level and the joint level, the Ministry stated.

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Mr. Pompeo held talks in the evening at Hyderabad House. The 2+2 inter-ministerial talks are scheduled to be held at 10 a.m. on Tuesday. Later the two visiting Secretaries will call on Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his residence.

After the talks on Tuesday, U.S. officials will leave for Sri Lanka, Maldives and Indonesia.

As reported by The Hindu last month, in the run up to the 2+2, the U.S. was keen on India signing BECA and discussions continued to iron out the differences. One of the major differences was the issue of reciprocity in exchange of geo-spatial data.

A maritime information agreement is also under discussion between India and the US, an official source stated. India already has such agreement with other Quad countries, Australia and Japan. As reported by The Hindu last month, in the run up to the 2+2, the U.S. was keen on India signing BECA and discussions continued to iron out the differences. One of the major differences was the issue of reciprocity in exchange of geo-spatial data.

Liason officers

The Defence Ministry said the two Ministers “also discussed requirements of expanding deployments of liaison officers.”

India has posted a liaison officer at the U.S. Navy Central Command in Bahrain recently and is also considering a U.S. request for posting liaison officers at the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) and the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). The U.S. has already posted a liaison officer at the Indian Navy’s Information Fusion Centre for Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR).

A U.S. State department official said in Washington on Saturday that the talks will focus on four themes — regional security cooperation, defence information sharing, military-to-military interactions, and defence trade.

“This agreement (BECA) will allow for expanded geospatial information sharing between our armed forces. We are also seeking to expand secure communication capabilities between our respective militaries as well as between our foreign and defence ministries, and that too figures prominently on what we are trying to accomplish in the information-sharing space,” he stated.

“Holding the third U.S.-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in just over two years demonstrates a high-level commitment to our shared diplomatic and security objectives,” said the U.S. State department in a statement ahead of the talks, citing India-U.S. defence cooperation, enhanced military exercises, and defence trade.

“India maintains the largest fleets of C-17 and P-8 aircraft outside of the United States, and as of 2020, the United States has authorised more than $20 billion in defence sales to India,” the statement added.

Beginning 2016, India has signed three foundational agreements: the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) while the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) was signed a long time ago. An extension to the GSOMIA, the Industrial Security Annex (ISA), was signed at the last 2+2 dialogue.

Last week, India announced that Australia will join the Malabar exercise next month consisting of Japan and the U.S.. The Ministry said Mr. Esper welcomed Australia’s participation in the exercise Malabar 2020.

There has been a sharp increase in India’s maritime interactions with the Quad countries on a bilateral basis centered around information sharing for improved Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) in the Indian Ocean Region and Indo-Pacific.

While LEMOA has since been operationalised, COMCASA is in advanced stages of being operationalised. On September 25, for the first time a US Navy P-8A long range Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) landed at Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) Islands for refuelling under LEMOA.

93,2020/10/26,PM Modi bats for ‘responsible’ fuel pricing,"India has been drawing investments across the oil and gas value chain and other sectors even during these challenging times, and the country is a bright spot in an otherwise difficult year for the sector

Global energy producers must pursue more ‘responsible pricing’ policies and India needs ‘affordable and reliable’ energy sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday, arguing that world fuel prices have been on a ‘roller coaster’ for far too long.

India has been drawing investments across the oil and gas value chain and other sectors even during these challenging times, and the country is a bright spot in an otherwise difficult year for the sector, the PM said at the inaugural session of the India Energy Forum, ahead of a two-hour closed-door meeting with CEOs of top global energy firms.

“This year has been challenging for the energy sector — demand fell by almost one third, there has been price instability, investment decisions have been impacted and leading global bodies project contraction in global energy demand over the next few years also. But these agencies project India to emerge as a leading energy consumer, which is set to double its energy consumption over the long term,” he said.

“During these challenging times, we have witnessed investments through the oil and gas value chain and are seeing similar signs in other sectors too,” Mr. Modi said, stressing that a self-reliant India, with energy security at its core, ‘will also be a force multiplier for the global economy’.

Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said that after the initial effects of the pandemic and the national lockdown, India is now on the road to full recovery with petroleum products consumption returning to levels witnessed before the COVID-19 scourge.

Pricing concerns

“For too long, the world has seen fuel prices on a roller coaster. We need to move towards responsible pricing and work towards transparent and flexible markets for both oil and gas,” Mr. Modi said at the forum where top officials and Ministers from OPEC nations as well as India’s large energy suppliers such as the United States and Saudi Arabia were present.

“India believes that access to energy must be affordable and reliable. That is when social economic transformation can take place. We view the energy sector [as one] that empowers people and improves ease of living,” he said, highlighting the government’s ambition to ‘ensure energy justice’.

India will stick to its global commitments towards climate change, while tapping more energy to improve the lives of Indians with a smaller carbon footprint, he asserted.

“India’s energy sector will be growth-centric, industry friendly and environment-conscious… India will always work keeping in mind the global good,” the PM said, adding that it has one of the lowest carbon emissions in the industrialised world.

‘High-speed reforms’

Espousing oil and gas sector reforms in recent times — such as the exploration and licencing policy unveiled in 2019 and the natural gas pricing changes announced earlier this month — as ‘pathbreaking’, the PM said: “India’s reform journey has been on high speed for the last six years… There will be continuity of these robust energy policies that have been in place… India’s energy will energise the world.”

“To increase domestic production of natural gas and to bring uniformity in market price, we have announced natural gas marketing reforms earlier this month. They will give greater marketing freedom in the sale of natural gas,” he said, stressing that increasing domestic gas production has been a key priority as the government is keen to shift to a gas-based economy and achieve its ‘One Nation, One Gas Grid’ goal.

“A ray of sun brightens the journey of human progress. Like the seven horses driving the chariot of the Sun God, India’s energy map will now have seven key drivers of change,” the PM said. He listed the seven drivers — accelerating efforts towards a gas-based economy; cleaner use of fossil fuels, particularly petroleum and coal; greater reliance on domestic sources to drive biofuel; achieving the renewable energy target of 450 GW by 2030; increasing the contribution of electricity to decarbonise mobility; moving into emerging fuels, including hydrogen; and digital innovation across all energy systems.

The 2019 exploration and licencing policy has shifted the focus from revenue to production maximisation and is enshrined in greater transparency and streamlined procedures, Mr. Modi said, expressing plans to raise India’s refining capacity from about 250 million metric tonnes a year to 400 million metric tonnes by 2025.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/io3bll/article32945491.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODIKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-will-drive-global-energy-demand-pm-modi/article32945492.ece

The first day has been scheduled for deliberating on matters related to human resource management, an Army source said. The commanders will brain storm on a series of reform measures to cut down on ceremonial practices, among other measures, a second source said.

There will be a comprehensive review of the situation across all the borders including Ladakh, the second source said. Chine has deployed close to 50,000 troops along the LAC, which has been matched by India, and with no breakthrough in talks for disengagement, both sides have made preparations for deployment at high altitudes in the harsh winters.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen. Bipin Rawat as well as the Navy and Air Force Chiefs are scheduled to address the conference on Tuesday. The biennial conference is attended by senior officers of the Army including the Vice-Chief, seven Army commanders, Principal Staff Officers (PSOs) of the Army headquarters and other senior officers.

On Wednesday, the Commander-in-Chief of the Andaman and Nicobar Command, the only tri-service command, will update the Army commanders. Several studies are currently underway for the formation of integrated tri-service commands beginning with a joint air defence command.

The last day of the conference will include an update by the Director General of Border Roads Organisation (BRO) on the various infrastructure development projects being undertaken by BRO and allied formations.

95,2020/10/26,Polio networks to play crucial role in COVID-19 vaccine rollout: WHO,"Surveillance staff covered 208 million people across all 75 districts over last three months to check pandemic

Uttar Pradesh, the most populous State in the country, used polio micro-plans twice in the last three months to help identify over two lakh people with COVID-19 symptoms. These persons were then followed-up and tested for COVID-19, said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director WHO South-East Asia, while citing U.P. as an example of applying strategies from polio eradication programmes, to help contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a release issued by the WHO, South East Asia Region, Dr. Singh also indicated that in the coming months “polio networks, with their vast knowledge on vaccination and tools and strategies tailored to reach the unreached and the most vulnerable, could play a critical role for COVID-19 vaccination roll out.”

She added that in U.P., the surveillance medical officers’ team coordinated with the State government and a massive initiative of house-to-house surveillance to identify people with symptoms of influenza-like illness and co-morbidities was conducted. This covered 208 million people across all 75 districts.

Stating that the polio-network has been effectively used in south-east Asia region during the pandemic, she said: “Within weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak, the integrated surveillance and immunisation networks in five polio priority countries of the region were re-purposed to support preparedness and response. Working among the most vulnerable population and areas, these networks are helping health authorities to detect, test, track, isolate and even prepare hospitals to provide adequate and timely treatment.”

Dr Singh said that from assisting coordination at the national and sub-national levels, to training and building capacities for laboratory and other health workers for detecting cases, tracing contacts, and assessing public perceptions to hospital readiness and preparedness, the WHO’s polio surveillance networks in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar and Nepal, are supporting with strategies and initiatives, refined over the years and which helped the region achieve polio-free certification in March 2014.

Meanwhile, the Health Ministry in its release on Monday said India has recorded less than 500 deaths (480) in the last 24 hours.

“As part of the COVID-19 management and response policy, there has been a sharp focus of the Central Government on not only containing COVID-19, but to reduce deaths. Collaborative efforts of the Union and State/UT governments have resulted in strengthening of the health facilities across the country. 2218 Dedicated COVID hospitals are providing quality medical care,” said the Ministry.

It added that the fact that many States have conducted population surveys to map and identify the vulnerable population like the elderly, pregnant women and those with comorbidities, had also helped.

“This, with the help of technological solutions like mobile apps, has ensured keeping the high-risk population under continuous observation, thus aiding early identification, timely clinical treatment and reducing fatalities. At the ground level, frontline health workers like ASHAs and ANMs have helped to manage the migrant population and to enhance awareness at the community level. And as a result 14 States and UTs have case fatality rate lower than 1%,” said the Ministry.

These states include Kerala, Nagaland, Assam, Odisha, Bihar, Manipur among others. India has also reported 59,105 new recoveries in the last 24 hours, with Karnataka contributing maximum with more than 10,000 cases followed by Kerala with more than 7,000 cases.

“45,148 new confirmed cases were registered in the last 24 hours in the country.

96,2020/10/26,"Fearing bypoll loss, BJP engaging in ‘bargaining game’: Kamal Nath","Since March this year, 26 Congress MLAs have resigned and joined the BJP

A day after a Congress MLA joined the BJP, the party’s Madhya Pradesh unit president Kamal Nath on October 26 hit out at the saffron outfit, saying due to its imminent rout in the upcoming Assembly bypolls, it is engaging in “game of bargaining” and luring his legislators.

On October 25, Congress MLA from Damoh Rahul Lodhi joined the BJP after resigning from the Assembly. His resignation from the Congress came ahead of the November 3 bypolls to 28 Assembly seats, the results of which will be declared on November 10.

“Now they are left with only this option. I am getting calls from many Congress MLAs. They are telling that the BJP is luring them and offering money,” Mr. Kamal Nath said in Bhopal.

The BJP dismissed the Congress allegations and said Mr. Kamal Nath is not able to manage his party.

The former Chief Minister said the electorate of Madhya Pradesh is very simple and straightforward, but very much aware politically.

“Election is a celebration of democracy. But this has become a celebration of bargaining. I don’t believe in such politics,” he said.

“I have written a letter to the Election Commission today. Lower-level government employees are being pressurised to work in favour of the BJP,” the Leader of Opposition in Assembly said.

Mr. Kamal Nath said the BJP knows that it is not getting the numbers to save its government in the bypolls so it has started luring Congress MLAs.

Since March this year, 26 Congress MLAs have resigned and joined the BJP.

Baseless comments, says BJP

Reacting to Mr. Kamal Nath’s allegations, State BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agrawal said the State Congress chief is not able to manage his party.

“He should not make baseless comments against the BJP,” Mr. Agrawal said.

The BJP spokesman said Mr. Nath is not even listening to the advice of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who has condemned certain controversial remarks of the MP Congress chief.

In March, 22 Congress MLAs, most of them loyalists of Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia, had resigned from the party and the State Assembly.

This had led to the collapse of the 15-month-old Kamal Nath-led Congress government and cleared the way for the BJP to again come to power.

Mr. Scindia and his loyalists joined the BJP with some of the rebel MLAs becoming Ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ju3193/article32944165.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-KAMALNATH-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fearing-bypoll-loss-bjp-engaging-in-bargaining-game-kamal-nath/article32944166.ece

Ananya Birla, the daughter of Aditya Birla Group’s billionaire chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, has slammed a US restaurant for being racist , saying the Italian-American dining place in California literally threw her and her family out of their premises.

The entrepreneur, singer and artist took to Twitter to share her ordeal on Saturday, saying this is not okay.

“This restaurant @ScopaRestaurant literally threw my family and I, out of their premises. So racist. So sad. You really need to treat your customers right. Very racist. This is not okay,” she said in a tweet.

The Scopa Italian Roots restaurant is an Italian-American dining place by chef Antonia Lofaso in California.

Actor Payal Ghosh, who accused filmmaker Anurag Kashyap of raping her, joined the Republican Party of India (Athawale) on Monday.

She, along with some others, joined the party in the presence of its chief and Union minister Ramdas Athawale.

Ms Ghosh was appointed vice-president of the women’s wing of the party.

Mr Athawale said the entry of Ms Ghosh and others into the party would strengthen it.

He also claimed Kashyap would be arrested soon. The filmmaker has continuously denied the allegations leveled by Ms Ghosh.

99,2020/10/26,NPAs not worth of vermiculture preserved at NHAI needs to be weeded out: Gadkari,"He was addressing a virtual gathering during the inauguration of NHAI building at Dwarka which took about nine years to complete

Unhappy over a ‘delayed’ work culture in NHAI, Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday said it was time to show exit door to ‘non-performing assets’ complicating and delaying projects by creating obstacles.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has become a breeding ground for inefficient officials who are creating hurdles and referring every matter to committees and it was time to ‘suspend’ and ‘terminate’ them and bring in reforms in its functioning, the Road Transport, Highways and MSME Minister said.

He was addressing a virtual gathering during the inauguration of NHAI building at Dwarka which took about nine years to complete.

“Non-performing assets (NPAs) not worth of doing even vermiculture are preserved here and being promoted... I feel ashamed at the attitude of such officials who are carrying such legacies...

“They are delaying decisions and creating complications and at the helm, these are CGMs (Chief General Managers) and GMs (General Managers) sitting for years,” Mr. Gadkari said while expressing his unhappiness over the delay in construction of NHAI building.

He said the building project for which tender was awarded in 2011, took almost nine years to complete and saw seven NHAI chairmen and two governments.

“Finally it could be completed during the tenure of the eighth Chairman (SS Sandhu) ...A research paper should be prepared on this classic case of delay with photographs of CGMs and GMs who were behind the delays...There should be a ceremony to make their names and photos public like the ministry does to facilitate those who do exceptionally good work,” the Minister said.

Mr. Gadkari said he has been emphasising on widespread reforms in NHAI but of no avail and said when mammoth work for ₹1 lakh crore Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is planned to be executed within three years, how could a single building take about ten years in completion.

“I feel ashamed...I had personally conducted three-four meetings for it...I have been insisting on reforms...Now as the tradition is, records will be prepared to blame the contractors alone,” the Minister said and warned officials to mend their ways.

The minister wondered as to why the Authority was not able to retain engineers from IITs and other institutes and why those “who were not even fit to work for states were being promoted and their “wrong decisions” were costing the exchequer heavily.

Warning the officials to change their work pattern, Mr. Gadkari said he would personally oversee termination, suspension and removal of guilty officials.

Mr. Gadkari has been stressing on the need to expedite decision-making by NHAI and ministry officials while cautioning that non-performers would be given compulsory retirement.

The minister had earlier this year said that he had sought a list of non-performing officials for showing the exit door.

He had warned “non-performing” officials or “dead assets” who neither take decisions nor allow others to work of showing exit door while saying that red-tapism will not be tolerated.

NHAI’s new building has been constructed over a 6,086 square meter plot in Dwarka area, adjacent to NHAI’s existing office complex.

It has ground plus seven stories, with two levels of basement.

NHAI plans to shift around 400 of its employees to the new building, which is equipped with latest building management system, computer automation and state-of-the-art facilities for enhanced work performance.

NHAI has been mandated the task to develop, maintain and manage National Highways, the arterial roads of the country, for inter-state movement of passengers and goods.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/kldsd3/article31973933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03BUNITINGADKARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/npas-not-worth-of-vermiculture-preserved-at-nhai-needs-to-be-weeded-out-gadkari/article32943817.ece

The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Karnataka High Court to decide the CCI plea for vacating stay on the investigation against e-commerce giants Amazon and Flipkart for alleged anti-competitive practices.

A Bench comprising Justices A.M. Khanwikar, Dinesh Maheswari and Sanjiv Khanna asked the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to approach the High Court for relief.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CCI said that the probe ordered against e-commerce companies was administrative in nature and would not affect the rights of any party.

He sought keeping the petition pending saying there are several wider issues involved in the case.

Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, appearing for the e-commerce companies, said the CCI approached the top court after the delay of over 200 days.

The Bench said that the High Court would hear the matter and decide it within six weeks and added the petition may be revived if no decision is given by the High Court in the said period.

On February 14, the High Court had granted an interim stay on the investigation ordered by the CCI against e-commerce companies Amazon and Flipkart.

Amazon had moved the High Court seeking a stay on the investigation ordered by the CCI.

Flipkart also filed a petition in the High Court seeking to quash the order passed by the CCI directing a probe into allegations of anti-competitive conduct.

In its plea, Amazon had sought quashing and setting aside the CCI’s January 13, 2020 probe order, and had also prayed the court to provide relief based on “facts and circumstances of the case in the interest of justice”.

In its petition before the High Court, Amazon had contended that the CCI order had been passed “without application of mind” and would cause irreparable loss/ injury to the goodwill/reputation of the company if an investigation is allowed.

The fair trade regulator CCI, in January, this year had ordered the probe against Flipkart and Amazon for alleged malpractices, including deep discounting and tie-ups with preferred sellers on their platforms.

The order by CCI followed complaints filed by traders’ bodies including by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, whose members comprise many traders dealing in smart phones and related accessories.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/b94ub5/article32875137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/E-commerce,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-asks-karnataka-hc-to-decide-cci-plea-for-vacating-stay-on-probe-against-e-com-firms/article32943578.ece
101,2020/10/26,SC puts on hold order appointing Justice Madan Lokur to head panel to prevent stubble-burning,"Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informs Bench that a new law may come out in the next few days that proposes to have a permanent body to deal with stubble-burning.

The Supreme Court on Monday decided to “keep in abeyance” its pre-Dussehra order appointing former Supreme Court judge Justice Madan B. Lokur to a one-man committee to monitor/prevent stubble-burning in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab.

The decision to put on hold its October 16 order came soon after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde that the Centre had “proposed a legislation to tackle the problem” which occurs annually and chokes the Capital.

Mr. Mehta said the new law may come out in the next few days that proposed to have a permanent body to deal with stubble-burning.

“Having regard to the statement made, we consider it appropriate that the measures adopted in the order of October 16 be kept in abeyance until further orders,” the court recorded in its order.

On October 16, the court asked Justice Lokur with the help of student volunteer forces deployed from the National Cadet Corps, National Service Scheme and Bharat Scouts and Guides to protect Delhi NCR from air pollution caused by stubble-burning in neighbouring Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh this winter.

The court had said the student forces could patrol highways and fields in the three States and ensure that no fires were started in the fields.

It asked the Chief Secretaries of the three States to provide facilities to the committee and provide student volunteers with adequate transportation to aid their vigil.

It directed the existing mobile teams and nodal officers of the States to report to the committee.

The court chose Justice Lokur for the task as the retired judge had headed the Green Bench which was monitoring stubble-burning for two whole years before his retirement.

His name was recommended by senior advocate Vikas Singh, who is appearing for two children apprehensive about the onslaught of incoming waves of smog caused by unbridled stubble burning in the three States this winter.

Mr. Singh voiced that the issue of stubble-burning had to be tackled without delay. Mr. Mehta said the government shared the concerns of his clients.

The Bench said the court would opt for status quo till it studied the proposed law. A hearing has been scheduled for Thursday.

The last time, Mr. Singh had said that stubble fires were five times more in Punjab regardless of a remote-sensing app used by the State.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/2asujl/article32947481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THLOKUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-puts-on-hold-order-appointing-j-lokur-to-head-panel-to-prevent-stubble-burning/article32943149.ece

103,2020/10/26,"Ladakh poll: 15 seats for BJP, Cong. wins 9","National Conference, Peoples Democraric Party did not participate in the elections

The BJP on Monday won the majority of seats in the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, Leh (LAHDC-Leh) polls, by capturing 15 of the 26 constituencies, followed by the Congress with nine.

The BJP managed to win most of the far-off seats outside the Leh town, including six of the seven seats of the remote Nubra valley. Two Muslim faces, Ghulam Mehdi from Turtuk and Mirza Hussain from Chuchot, were among its winners.

In Khaltsi, the party’s Lobzang Sherab defeated Jigmet Rabgais of the Congress with a thin margin of nine votes. However, in Chuchot, its Hussain defeated an independent candidate Sayeeda Bano by a margin of 735 votes.

Tsering Namgyal of the Congress defeated BJP’s P.Wangdan with the highest margin of 1,116 votes in Lower Leh.

The constituencies won by the BJP included Turtuk, Panamik, Tegar, Hunder, Diskit, Tangtse, Kungyam, Sku Markha, Thiksey, Korzok, Lingshed, Lamayuru, Martseylang, Khaltse and Chuchot.

The seats won by the Congress were Lower Leh, Upper Leh, Igoo, Saspol, Basgo, Sakti, Phyang, Skurbuchan and Temisgam. Chushul and Nyoma were two seats won by the independent candidates.

“First major victory for BJP in UT Ladakh. The BJP won 15 of the 26 seats in the Leh Autonomous District Council elections. Congrats team BJP, Ladakh UT,” tweeted party leader Ram Madhav.

Compared to the 2015 results, the BJP has come down by two seats from 17 to 15 this year.

Four Union Ministers — Mukthar Abbas Naqvi, Kiren Rijju, Anurag Thakur and G. Kishan Reddy — besides senior leaders campaigned for the BJP candidates in Leh, with a population of 1.33 lakh.

The campaign for the polls was dominated by the demand for the Sixth Schedule status to protect local demography, jobs and land and legislative powers to the LAHDC-Leh. The BJP has backed the demand to grant a fresh special status to the region.

It was the first-ever polls conducted for the council since Ladakh was carved out as a Union Territory (UT) last year. The polls, in which electronic voting machines (EVMs) were employed for the first time, were held in the backdrop of the India-China border face-off and the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was also for the first time that neither the National Conference (NC) nor the Peoples Democraric Party (PDP) had participated in the elections. The new entrant Aam Aadmi Party failed to bag any seat in the region.

104,2020/10/26,SC declines interim relief for OBC quota in AIQ seats in TN govt.-run medical colleges,"In the last hearing held in the case, the National Medical Commission had said it was not possible to extend OBC quota benefits this year for NEET-UG candidates.

The Supreme Court on Monday declined to order the interim relief of implementing 50% reservation this year itself for NEET-UG students belonging to Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in medical and dental seats contributed to the All India Quota (AIQ) by State government-run colleges in Tamil Nadu.

A Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao refused the interim relief on separate petitions filed by Tamil Nadu government represented by senior advocate V. Giri, AIADMK represented by advocate Balaji Srinivasan and DMK by senior advocate P. Wilson, among other parties.

In the last hearing held in the case, the National Medical Commission had said it was not possible to extend OBC quota benefits this year for NEET-UG candidates because students had filled their application forms for NEET in January-February itself.

“They had also filled the category under which they were applying. The NEET results would also show this category... The OBC reservation was not open then in January-February,” Mr. Sharma had submitted then.

Mr. Sharma, who was supported by the Centre, had said the reservation roster was already fixed by the Directorate General of Health Services.

The NEET results was declared on October 16, followed by the counselling sessions.

In August, the Tamil Nadu government and the other parties had challenged a Madras High Court decision to set up a committee to “finalise” the OBC reservation in State-surrendered seats for the All India Quota in non-central medical colleges.

They had objected to how the high court had declined to straightaway order the Centre and MCI to implement 50% reservation for Backward Classes, Most Backward Classes and Denotified Community in these seats in undergraduate, postgraduate and diploma medical and dental courses in compliance with reservation rules followed in the State for the academic year 2020-21.

The high court, in its decision on July 27, had declined the mandamus “despite finding there is a clear substantive law providing for State-specific reservation formulated by the MCI.”

“Instead, the court set up a committee, when such a committee was unnecessary, consisting of the Directorate General of Health Services, the MCI and the Tamil Nadu government department concerned to finalise the manner in which the facilities of OBC reservation are to be provided,” the Tamil Nadu government had said.

The State had argued that the high court was self-contradictory.

“Once the court has determinatively found that the governing law provides for OBC reservation as per Tamil Nadu rules, then the proverbial ‘story’ ends there and the appropriate authorities ought to be directed to apply the law. The committee therefore is aimless and entirely redundant,” the State had argued.

It said the high court had further excluded OBC reservation for the current academic year – despite finding that there is a legal right. This has denied a number of deserving OBC candidates seats in the All India Quota for 2020-2021.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/7f73yc/article32924942.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th18faqsingleGSI7SBIGK3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-rejects-pleas-for-interim-relief-of-medical-obc-quota-in-tn/article32942396.ece

The TDP leaders’ team was on a visit to flood-affected areas in Krishna and West Godavari districts.

When the team reached Siddapuram in Akiveedu mandal, Lokesh drove a tractor-trailer owned by a farmer. However, when the vehicle was crossing a water-logged area, near Upputeru, he lost control of the vehicle and the tractor veered off the road and waded into an irrigation canal.

Tension prevailed in Kuppam, Ramakuppam, Shantipuram and Gudupalle mandals of Kuppam Assembly Constituency on Monday, after the police foiled the “maha padayatra” programme of the Telugu Desam Party, while at the same time preventing YSR Congress Party cadres from taking out a counter-protest over local issues.

According to information, TDP cadres, under leadership of MLC Gownivari Srinivasulu, had planned the maha padayatra from Ramakuppam to Kuppam, in support of the demand for completion of the Handri Neeva Kuppam Branch canal. The party had mobilised its cadres, and planned to launch a five-day padayatra from Ramakuppam mandal headquarters to Kuppam on Monday.

Reacting to this TDP’s protest plan, the YSRCP leadership in Kuppam gave a counter call of walkathon from the same mandal on Monday, alleging that the TDP was behind stalling of distribution of house pattas to over 25,000 beneficiaries in Kuppam constituency by taking the matter to the court.

Reacting to the schedules of the two parties, the Palamaner sub-division police on Saturday issued notices to both parties, denying permission to their programmes. About 300 police personnel were deployed at Ramakuppam mandal headquarters on Sunday midnight, followed by confining key TDP functionaries to their houses, including former minister N.

112,2020/10/26,Banni festival: tension mounts at Devaragattu,"Heavy police forces deployed, liquor shops in border areas closed

The annual Banni Utsavam - 2020 at Devaragattu Mala Malleswaram Swamy Temple has been banned by the State government in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the backdrop of the ban, over 1,200 police personnel were deployed in the village in Aluru constituency, while tension prevailed in the area on Monday evening.

Superintendent of Police Fakkeerappa Kaginelli said anyone found with sticks or torches would be booked. All liquor shops were closed down in the border region of Karnataka and RTC bus services to the area suspended. All roads leading to Devaragattu were closed by erecting 15 checkpoints.

“All rituals as part of kalyanam will be allowed only with the main organisers participating in it, but none from outside will be allowed to participate in the traditional fight with sticks in the light of ‘Kagadas’ will not be allowed,” he added. Even as police clampdown continues, people are making all preparations for making of the torches, and people from several villages in Karnataka were eagerly waiting to enter the region from the hillocks. Drone cameras and 100 CCTV cameras were installed in the region.

People from three different villages form into two groups and fight with each other with sticks fitted with metal rings to secure the ceremonial statues, as they believe development will take place in the village that secures the statues.

113,2020/10/26,HC suspends G.O. limiting intake in private jr. colleges,"A single-judge bench of the High Court ordered the interim suspension of G.O. MS No.23 through which the government sought to restrict the intake of all private junior colleges to 360 except those having a permanent affiliation subject to the availability of infrastructure and staff, for four weeks with effect from October 21.

Justice D. Ramesh was hearing the writ petitions filed by Kolli Brahmaiah, president of the Central Andhra Junior College Managements’ Association, Atmakur (Nellore) and V. Srinivasa Durga Prasad, correspondent of Sai Geethanjali Junior College, Bapulapadu (Krishna district).

The judge observed that though the impugned G.O. was issued to make an amendment to G.O. MS No.114 and there was no dispute about the scheme (of imposing curbs on the intake of private junior colleges) formulated as per the directions of the High Court, there was no reason mentioned in the controversial G.O.s for the imposition of restrictions leaving out government colleges, aided private colleges and private junior colleges having a permanent affiliation.

The court, therefore, directed the government to place the G.O. under suspension. The petitioners contended that reducing the intake of only private junior colleges from 792 to 360 was discriminatory and it would exert tremendous pressure on students in the present situation when all those who appeared in the 10th class were declared as passed in the examinations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/8lyyl/article32528701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05VJPG4-HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hc-suspends-go-limiting-intake-in-private-jr-colleges/article32946766.ece

119,2020/10/26,Both YSR Cong and TDP governments were mired in corruption: Somu Veerraju,"BJP State president Somu Veerraju said both the YSR Congress (YSRC) and TDP have belied the people's expectations on Amaravati whereas the Central government made a significant contribution to the development of the State by sanctioning many projects.

The YSRC government completely neglected many projects undertaken by the previous dispensation.

Both the YSRC and TDP governments were mired in corruption. The BJP would expose the alleged complicity of YSRC MLAs in irregularities in 21 projects sponsored by the Central government, he stated.

Addressing media persons here on Monday, Mr. Veerraju said the party's stand on capital was clear and it was committed to the establishment of the High Court in Rayalaseema.

He insisted that former chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu should give details of the financial assistance extended by the Centre for the development of Amaravati.

The YSRC government failed to translate it's words into deeds. The Centre sanctioned several infrastructure projects keeping in view the help which the State required after bifurcation.

The BJP leader demanded that the government should refrain from diverting the funds belonging to Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams. In this regard, the party wrote a letter to the government.

There were many issues in which the State government owed an explanation to the public, Mr. Veerraju said adding that the BJP and Jana Sena Party would soon organise protest demonstrations to protect the people's interests.

120,2020/10/26,COVID-19 | Manjunath advocates use of remdesivir in treatment,"He emphasises that the antiviral drug should be administered to COVID-19 patients before they turn extremely sick

Cardiologist C.N. Manjunath has favoured the use of antiviral drug remdesivir in the treatment of moderately sick COVID-19 patients.

His recommendation comes even after a World Health Organisation (WHO) study indicated that remdesivir appeared to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or in-hospital course of COVID-19 among hospitalised patients.

Participating in a virtual panel discussion on Infectious Diseases Control organised by e-Health magazine published by Elets Technomedia recently, Dr. Manjunath, who is also the Director of state-run Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, said the expert pulmonologists in the State strongly felt that remdesivir is effective when it is given at the “right time to the right patient”.

He described as “quite satisfactory” the experience of seven renowned pulmonologists, who are also part of the State’s Expert Committee on COVID-19 treatment. These pulmonologists treat hundreds of patients on a daily basis, Dr. Manjunath said.

However, he emphasised that the antiviral drug should be given to patients before they turn “extremely sick”.

About 300 people in Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research in Bengaluru too had tested positive and 30 of them were very sick. The patients were treated with a combination of remdesivir and other drugs. Fortunately, there was no mortality and all of them recovered.

Also, Dr. Manjunath said the cost of the antiviral drug has been reduced since June-July along with other consumables.

Contending that the healthcare scenario in the State was progressing positively, Dr. Manjunath said physicians engaged in the treatment of COVID-19 now have confidence that most of the infected patients will recover as about 90% of the positive cases had been cured on their own or through simple treatment. According to a study, Dr. Manjunath said about 8% required oxygen.

He also made out a case for paying parallel attention to non-COVID-19 cases. “We are talking only about COVID-19, but a lot of non-COVID patients too are suffering today,” he said while pointing out that a study had indicated that several people were dying due to cardiac and renal issues.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hsu7ov/article32947816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGMANJUNATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-manjunath-advocates-use-of-remdesivir-in-treatment/article32947817.ece

This year’s Mysuru Dasara, celebrated to keep alive the tradition but with restrictions amidst the pandemic, had the theme of the prevailing COVID-19 reflected in many forms.

While it was inaugurated by a doctor in the frontline of fight against COVID-19 and had COVID-19 warriors felicitated as part of the inaugural event, it was the theme of the tableaux as well on the festival finale on Vijayadashami day.

This year’s Jamboo Savari was used as an opportunity to pay tribute to the COVID-19 warriors and also spread the word on the ways and means of containing and combating the pandemic that has claimed several lives, and destructed the economy globally.

Platform for education

As the finale was watched by millions of people with the event telecast live on some television channels and also live streamed on various social media networks although the entry to the palace was restricted, the Mysuru Zilla Panchayat and the Department of Health and Family Welfare made use of the occasion to extend the gratitude to the warriors.

The tableau was dedicated to the frontline workers. With messages all around the artwork and models prescribing do’s and don’ts, the tableau showed a large figurine of a woman health worker covering her nose and mouth with a mask and wearing a PPE kit as a protection from the virus. It highlighted the necessity of taking precautions like use of sanitisers and the need for frequent hand washing and staying indoors unless going out was essential in the ongoing fight.

The Dasara inauguration too was done by cardiologist and the director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research C.N. Manjunath, who is part of the COVID-19 expert committee. During the inauguration, Dr. Manjunath had prayed for the arrival of early vaccine. Six COVID-19 warriors were felicitated as well.

122,2020/10/26,Patients complain of pressure sores and marks owing to NIV masks,"COVID-19 patients who were on non-invasive ventilator (NIV) in the intensive care units (ICUs) are returning to hospitals reporting scars on their faces, which are pressure sores caused due to the NIV masks. This, doctors pointed out, has occurred as many patients were on NIVs for over a week to 10 days.

Gunasekar Vuppalapati, Chief Medical Director, GVG Invivo Hospital, said that around 15% of the patients who were in the ICU and had recovered are coming back to the hospital to report these scars. He said these marks are found on the nose and forehead, while a few of them have them on the cheeks as well. “Usually, for people who have recovered from COVID-19 after facing a near death experience, coming back to get their scars treated is not a priority. But we want patients to come to get these marks treated and we are suggesting non-surgical treatment that can help heal them faster,” he said.

Mohammed Attaullah Khan S., Consultant Interventional Pulmonologist at Mallige Medical Centre, said that these scars were common among not just COVID-19 patients, but all patients who were on NIV for a long time. “When we are treating the patient, we put them on NIV as saving the life is more important for us. It is common to report these scars and if patients wish, they can be rectified by consulting a plastic surgeon,” he said.

Jagadish Hiremath, chief executive officer, Ace-Suhas Hospital, said that to avoid these pressure sores, they ensure that they alternate between NIV masks and non-rebreather masks for a few hours. “When a person is on NIV, the blood supply to that area is less and it leads to complications such as ulcers or marks. So we try to ensure that the blood supply is adequate when we put the non-rebreather mask. ” He said that some of the patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and have been on NIV for long complain of darkness of the skin and they have given them the necessary treatment.

A doctor of a city-based hospital who did not wish to be quoted said that the pressure sores could be avoided and the sores and the marks reflected poor nursing care.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/patients-complain-of-pressure-sores-and-marks-owing-to-niv-masks/article32947764.ece

In what is one of the lowest number reported in the State in several weeks, 3,130 new COVID-19 cases were reported in the State on Monday. Of these, 1,603 cases have been reported in Bengaluru Urban.

However, the number of tests conducted on Monday had reduced to 65,892.

Munish Moudgil, who heads the Karnataka State War Room, said conducting high number of tests – particularly RT PCR tests was the way to beat COVID-19. “Even when the positivity rate and new cases reported fall, we should continue to conduct large number of tests and it would prevent the recurrence of a second wave,” he said, adding that this analysis would hold true if all other factors remained constant. He also said that all districts and States should ensure that their daily testing, particularly RT PCR tests, remains high if they want to reduce and contain COVID-19.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/number-of-new-cases-drops/article32947761.ece
124,2020/10/26,Target set for marshals to levy fines in Bengaluru,"BBMP officials, however, say setting such targets is highly unrealistic

Marshals in Bengaluru have been empowered to levy fines on citizens who are not wearing masks or maintaining social distance. The marshals in south zone have been given a target to achieve every day.

In an order issued to a marshal supervisor, Munish Moudgil, Secretary of Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms, who has been deputed as zonal coordinator in south zone, has said that marshals should book a minimum of 20 offenders per day in each Assembly constituency coming under the zone. Any failure to meet this target will lead to action on south zone marshal supervisor and the division supervisors concerned. Action would be initiated under Disaster Management Act, 2005, for “deliberate failure to take action to control COVID-19 without any further notice.”

BBMP officials, on the other hand, are not taking this too kindly. A senior official, on condition of anonymity, said that setting such targets was highly unrealistic. “It is a double whammy for the marshals, who are also facing a lot of public ire. The setting of targets will also create ill-will among the citizens,” the official said.

BBMP’s Special Commissioner D. Randeep said that with repeated instances of public aggression against marshals, he had suggested to civic chief N.

126,2020/10/26,First elections in State amidst pandemic,"It is seen as important for BJP, which is trying to increase its presence in the Legislative Council

In the midst of recent floods that have brought devastation to several North Karnataka districts, and a high-decibel campaign for byelections to two Assembly seats in South Karnataka, the State is set to witness its first elections during the COVID-19 pandemic, as polls will get underway for the four Legislative Council seats on Wednesday.

The polls have been necessitated owing to the retirement of members representing Karnataka West Graduates’, North East Teachers’, South East Graduates’, and Bangalore Teachers’ constituencies on June 30. The four constituencies are spread across 18 districts in the State. The unprecedented times of COVID-19 had seen postponement of the elections, only to be scheduled for October 28. The counting of votes will be taken up on November 2.

Why it is important

The elections are being seen as important for the BJP, which is trying to increase its presence in the Upper House where it lacks majority. In a setback to the BJP government recently, the Upper House dominated by the Congress and the JD(S) voted against a Bill on labour reforms, stalled the Bill on land reforms, and did not allow placing of the Bill on APMC.

In the House of 75 members, the Congress has 28 members and the BJP 27 members, while the JD(S) has 14 members. There is one Independent, besides chairman K. Prathapchandra Shetty. Of the four vacant seats, two belonged to the JD(S), and one each to the BJP and the Congress.

Members, who retired on June 30, S.V. Sankanur (West Graduates) and Puttanna (Bangalore Teachers) of the BJP, Sharanappa Mattur (North East Teachers) of the Congress, and R. Chowda Reddy (South East Graduates) of the JD(S) are seeking re-election.

Former members Shashil G. Namoshi of the BJP and Ramesh Babu of the Congress are trying to get back to the Council from North East Teachers’ and South East Graduates’ constituencies, respectively. Former legislator and Kannada Vatal Paksha founder Vatal Nagaraj is also in the fray from North East Teachers’ constituency.

Some defectors

Of these, Mr. Puttanna and Mr. Ramesh Babu, who were elected to the Council on JD(S) tickets before, are trying their luck from the BJP and the Congress, respectively. In a sudden turn of events last week, the JD(S), which is defending two seats Bangalore Teachers and South East Graduates, announced its support to Basavaraj Gurikar, the Independent candidate in West Graduates, and accused its candidate Shivashankar Kallur of staying away from campaigning.

“The pandemic has brought untold misery to teachers, which is one of the issues in the teachers’ constituency. In graduates’ constituency, campaign issues are revolving around employment, loan and payment of interest,” Congress spokesperson Muralidhar Halappa said.

Muted participation

According to JD(S) spokesperson T.A. Sharavana, the elections could see muted participation in the constituencies, which already have low voter registration. He added that the government’s policy on appointments will be among issues in the graduates’ constituency.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8cfu83/article32947658.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGOctCounci-strengthcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/first-elections-in-state-amidst-pandemic/article32947660.ece

The Janata Dal (Secular) on Monday said it will complain to the Election Commission over a “fake” post against its Rajarajeshwarinagar candidate that is being circulated on social media platforms, and also distribution of set-top boxes and cable connection to voters by the BJP candidate.

The post alleged that the Rajarajeshwarinagar JD(S) candidate V. Krishnamurthy had “compromised for the sake of money”. The party has also lodged a complaint with the cyber police against these posts on Kempegowda Vokkaligara Meesalathi Horata Samiti page.

“The byelection has been necessitated since the BJP candidate resigned. Social media platforms are being used to spread misinformation about our candidate. This is being made deliberately to affect the morale of the party workers,” JD(S) spokesperson T.A. Sharavana told presspersons here on Monday.

Alleging that the two national parties, the BJP and the Congress, were involved in election-related malpractices, he accused the Election Commission of turning a blind eye towards these violations.

‘Misuse of power’

“Power is being misused by the ruling party and caste card is being played by the Congress to win the elections,” Mr. Sharavana said, alleging that set-top boxes are being distributed by the BJP candidate to woo voters. “We have filed a complaint with the police on fake post and we will approach the Election Commission with a complaint on other issues,” he added.

The party’s candidate Mr. Krishnamurthy, against whom the alleged fake posts have been circulated, said that he was being defamed because those who have done it had something to fear because of his presence in the electoral arena. “My party has given ticket to an ordinary worker.

The State Congress on Monday petitioned to the Election Commission of India for violation of the model code of conduct by BJP candidate Munirathna in Rajarajeshwarinagar constituency, for broadcasting films projecting himself through the cable network owned by him and distributing set-top boxes.

The Congress alleged that television channels, through cable networks, were displaying Mr. Munirathna’s name and photograph for the voters.

In a complaint to the EC through the CEO of Karnataka, KPCC working president Saleem Ahmed and former MP and legal cell chairman V.S. Ugrappa said the BJP candidate was an additional director of cable network Rockline Telecommunications Pvt. Ltd. and the network had been providing feeds to TV channels.

The Congress alleged that the BJP candidate freely distributed about 50,000 set-top boxes, each costing ₹1,000. On October 26, while campaigning, Mr. Munirathna himself stated that he has distributed set-top boxes to voters, the complaint said.

“These acts of Mr. Munirathna is nothing but a bribe and undue influence on the voters for the furtherance of the prospects of his election which is an offence punishable under the provision of IPC and RP Act 1951 and the model code of conduct,” the Congress said. It further said that Mr. Munirathna waived the payment of charges for utilising cable services provided for the last two months.

The Congress urged officials concerned to take steps to stop the cable television services being broadcast by Mr. Munirathna which display his name and photographs and register a criminal case against him for bribing the voters.

In another compliant to the EC, the Congress alleged that Assistant Commissioners of Police Venkatesh Naidu, Malleshwarm Sub-Division, and Srinivas Reddy, ACP, Yeshwantpur Sub-Division, were directing subordinate police officers to register cases against workers and agents who were working in favour of Congress candidate Kusuma. The police officials working at the behest of Mr. Munirathna had registered cases against Congress workers, the complaint said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ayydvb/article32947632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGSADANANDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-complains-against-munirathna-for-misusing-cable-tv-network/article32947633.ece
129,2020/10/26,"₹1,573 crore released to State under NDA: Joshi","Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi said that in the last six years, the NDA government had released funds under National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) to the tune of 43.2% of the total demand by State, while it was just over 10% under UPA rule.

Addressing presspersons here on Monday, Mr. Joshi claimed that Union government led by the NDA had released more funds to the State under NDRF than the UPA-led government.

Countering allegations by the Congress leaders about not much relief being given to Karnataka, which had seen frequent natural calamities in the last few years, Mr. Joshi gave details of the funds released. “From financial years 2003-04 to 2013/14 during which Karnataka was under coalition governments and under the BJP, the total demand for grants under NDRF submitted to the Central government was ₹44,542 crore. And the UPA government released just ₹4,609 crore, which was just over 10.35% of the total demand,” he said.

“But under the NDA rule from 2014-15 to 2019-20, the State sought relief of ₹27,208 crore of which the NDA government released ₹11,753 crore, which is around 43.2% of the total demand,” he said, asking former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to first look into reality before making statements for the sake of politics.

Mr. Joshi maintained that in all sectors, including infrastructure, allocations under the NDA rule had been more than the UPA government. “If you ask any genuine farmer, he will tell you that highest Minimum Support Price for farm produce was fixed during the NDA rule,” he said.

The Congress leaders, including Mr. Siddarmaiah, had launched an attack on the BJP government in the State and the Centre alleging that no relief had reached the flood-displaced people. Mr. Siddaramaiah had even alleged that while Prime Minister Narendra Modi had no time to visit Karnataka, even relief was not being released by the Central government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1573-crore-released-to-state-under-nda-joshi/article32947588.ece
130,2020/10/26,‘People of Sira want to bring back focus on development agenda’,"Former Minister says he is confident of getting support from all communities

Senior Congress leader T.B. Jayachandra, who is facing byelections in Sira, entered the Legislative Assembly in 1978. The former Minister, who has won six times, held half a dozen portfolios in various governments and as chairman of nearly two dozen Cabinet sub-committees during the Congress government in 2013-18.

In an interview, he speaks about the development works he has done in the constituency and what remains to be done.

This election is a fight between old and experienced politicians like you and new faces of the BJP and JD(S).

Yes, I am an experienced politician. But, I am young in my mind and very healthy. I have not tired mentally or physically. I am in the constituency always and working.

What kind of work in the constituency will favour you?

I pumped in about ₹2,500 crore for various development works/schemes in the constituency during 2013-18 as the Minister. The taluk was drought-prone and the people faced severe drinking water crisis. Now, people in the town and villages are getting drinking water from the Hemavathi reservoir because of my efforts. The JD(S) candidate’s husband the late B. Satyanarayana and other JD(S) leaders had opposed bringing water to Sira from the reservoir.

Unlike the traditional support base, there seems to be a shift in Vokkaliga voters towards the Hindutva ideology and BJP. The signs were visible in the last polls. How will you counter it?

The BJP’s agenda will not work in Sira. People are intelligent. Development work has slowed down after my defeat by a slender margin two years ago. People want to bring back the development agenda.

How do you view H.D. Deve Gowda, former PM, campaigning here?

No doubt, it’s a triangular fight. The JD(S) and BJP leaders are campaigning actively. The BJP’s false propaganda will not work. The JD(S) has not brought any development work. I will say it is a fight between my services to the people versus the money power of the BJP candidate. It is better to ask Mr. Gowda about his campaign and not me.

All three parties have fielded Vokkaliga candidates. How do you counter your opponents and also get your community’s support?

True, all three parties have fielded candidates from one community. I am confident of getting support from voters of other communities as well, big or small.

This time, what are your promises to voters of Sira?

I promise to bring water to the constituency and district from the Upper Bhadra project, which is under progress. It will help fill 65 tanks. The Yettinahole project too will bring water to the district. I am sure Sira’s outlook will be much better than Tumakuru once the drinking water and pending infrastructure projects are completed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/el3n7b/article32947577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGJAYACHANDRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/people-of-sira-want-to-bring-back-focus-on-development-agenda/article32947578.ece
131,2020/10/26,Hukkeri’s remarks shock party colleagues,"He said he would campaign for Suresh Angadi’s kin if BJP gives the ticket

Prakash Hukkeri, one of the senior leaders of the Congress, shocked his party colleagues when he said that he would campaign for the BJP, if it decided to field a member of the late Suresh Angadi’s family in the Belagavi Lok Sabha bypolls. However, he has denied plans of joining the BJP.

The Lingayat leader from Examba near Chikkodi has been a Lok Sabha member from Chikkodi once, a member of the State Cabinet twice, and has entered the Assembly five times from Chikkodi and Sadalaga. He conceded defeat before BJP’s Annasaheb Jolle in Parliament elections from Chikkodi last year.

‘Great friend’

Mr. Hukkeri reasoned that Suresh Angadi was a “great friend” and he had great affection for the late leader’s family. He said he would not ask the BJP to give party ticket to Angadi’s wife or children, but if one of them were to get it, he would work towards ensuring their victory. “I will be as involved in their campaign as I would be in my son’s campaign,” he said.

He also said he would not bother much about the Congress high command’s response to his stand. “I would not care what they think or do. Angadi was a great friend and I will be doing my bit to help them win,” he said.

Mr. Hukkeri said while he was a contender to contest for bypolls from Belagavi, that would change if the BJP nominates a member of Angadi’s family. “I will not seek Congress ticket to fight them. I will instead, campaign for them,” he said.

On social media

This triggered an angry reaction from some Congress leaders and workers. Some workers filled their social media pages with anti-Hukkeri posts where they said that such leaders should not be allowed to continue in the Congress. Some BJP supporters welcomed the statement and said the BJP high command should invite Mr. Hukkeri to the party.

This was not easily accepted by the BJP either. Shankargouda Patil, Karnataka’s representative in New Delhi, said the BJP was not concerned about his statement. He also said he had no idea about Mr. Hukkeri’s plans or moves.

‘Unbecoming’

KPCC working president Satish Jarkiholi told journalists in Bailhongal on Monday that such statements were unbecoming of senior Congress leaders like Mr. Hukkeri. He said he would advise Mr. Hukkeri to concentrate on his constituency Chikkodi, rather than giving tips about the Belagavi bypoll. To a question, he said the party high command would decide on whether his statement merits disciplinary action.

A Congress leader, a State-level functionary, said such statements were not unexpected from Mr. Hukkeri. He had quarrelled with the Congress election committee that had rejected his application for party ticket from Belagavi Lok Sabha seat instead of Chikkodi. “Since then, he has been speaking in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP. He has also been showing interest in entering the fray from Belagavi,” he said. “Mr. Hukkeri has spoken thus to send a message that he is a formidable political force in the district.”

Mr. Hukkeri told The Hindu that his statement was non-political and that he had made it based on his emotional relationship with the Angadi family. He saw no contradiction in being a Congressman and announcing support to a friend’s family who is from a different party. He denied suggestions that he was hinting that he would join the BJP.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/y7dfth/article32949539.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGHUKKERI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hukkeris-remarks-shock-party-colleagues/article32947574.ece
132,2020/10/26,Mysuru keeps colourful annual Dasara fete short,"Tusker Abhimanyu’s maiden procession, cultural tableaux lasted just 30 minutes

The first Dasara for tusker Abhimanyu in Mysuru, in the company of ‘Kumki’ elephants Kaveri and Vijaya, was a short affair as he had to traverse just 270 m rather than the usual 5 km.

The 10-day Mysuru Dasara festivities concluded on Monday under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the world famous Jamboo Savari finale being the shortest and the quickest.

The distance of about 270 m was covered in under 30 minutes, with a nominal presence of cultural troupes and tableaux.

In a normal year, the Savari is a big spectacle with multiple cultural events taking over three hours to complete. This year, the celebrations were only aimed at keeping the centuries-old tradition alive. The finale of Vijayadasami was confined to the Amba Vilas Palace.

Of the two tableaux presented, one was a tribute to COVID-19 warriors striving to save people. It showed a health worker wearing a mask and a PPE suit. Only six troupes took part — two groups of nadaswaram artistes, Veeragase Kunita and Chande Mela artistes, stilt walkers and Chilipili Gombe artistes. One stilt walker, as Chamundeshwari, and another as COVID-19 virus, depicted the deity killing the demon with a trishul. The finale, however, exceeded the ceiling of 300 attendees.

Jamboo Savari was limited to the palace in the past too: in 1994 due to the Surat plague and in 2002 due to the severe drought.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa flagged off the Savari, showering flowers on the Chamundeshwari idol in the 750-kg golden howdah on elephant Abhimanyu.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/d7eug8/article32947460.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27ABIMANYUP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-keeps-colourful-annual-dasara-fete-short/article32947461.ece
133,2020/10/26,Triangular contest likely in Karnataka West Graduates Constituency,"Two former teachers are challenging the incumbent who is also a former teacher.

: Karnataka West Graduates Constituency seems to be heading for a triangular fight with two former teachers challenging the incumbent who is also a former teacher.

Prof. S.V. Sankanur, seeking a second term, is being challenged by Prof. R.M. Kuberappa who earlier contested unsuccessfully on BJP ticket twice and turned rebel in Karnataka West Teachers Constituency in 2016. Now he is contesting on Congress ticket on a changed turf (Graduates Constituency).

The national vice-president of the All India Primary Teachers Federation (AIPTF) Basavaraj Gurikar, an independent candidate, is the second challenger for Prof. Sankanur. With the withdrawal of Janata Dal (Secular) candidate Shivashankar Kallur from the contest, Mr. Gurikar now has the support of the JD(S) along with support from the CPI, the CPI(M) and the SUCI(C). The changed scenario has certainly forced both the candidates of the mainstream parties to rework their poll strategy.

Former Cong. bastion

The West Graduates Constituency was once a Congress bastion, from where the former Minister and Congress leader H.K. Patil won four times in a row. However in 2008, Mohan Limbikai, a political greenhorn fielded by the BJP, handed him a shocking defeat putting a check to his unbeaten run. Later in the changed political scenario, Mr. Limbikai resigned from the council post in 2013 to unsuccessfully contest the Assembly election as candidate of B.S. Yediyurappa’s KJP.

With the return of Yediyurappa, Mr. Limbikai too came back to the BJP, but failed to impress upon the leadership to consider him for the council poll again. Instead of him, the BJP chose Prof. S.V. Sankanur, who by that time had lost against former Minister Basavaraj Horatti thrice in the teachers’ constituency. In 2014, despite an all out effort by Mr. Basavaraj Horatti to get his son Vasant Horatti elected to the council, Prof. Sankanur managed to convert the sympathy for him (for having lost three elections) and anti-Horatti sentiments into votes for him, registering a win with record margin of over 14,000 votes.

‘Sympathy factor’

While Prof. Sanknaur seeks a second term, his one-time friend turned foe Prof. R.M. Kuberappa is harping on the same ‘sympathy factor’ this time. Both Prof. Sankanur and Prof. Kuberappa have contested unsuccessfully against Mr. Basavaraj Horatti in the teachers constituency. Prof. Kuberappa too has lost thrice and is now striving hard to convert the sympathy factor into votes in the graduates constituency.

While BJP leaders are making all out efforts to retain the seat, Congress leaders too are campaigning extensively for winning back what was once their forte.

However both the camps are aware of the potential threat from Mr. Gurikar. Heading a teachers’ organisation, Mr. Gurikar still has a following among teachers who form a sizeable number among the graduate voters. The JD(S) has taken a calculated risk in making its candidate withdraw from the contest and support Mr. Gurikar as part of its policy to maintain equidistance from the Congress and the BJP. If everything goes on as planned, Mr. Basavaraj Horatti’s followers among the teaching fraternity might tilt the equations in favour of Mr. Gurikar.

However, with all the three being former teachers and part of different teachers’ associations, their rapport with the teaching fraternity would decide how much support they garner from the electorate. However, lack of interest among the graduates regarding the poll process has brought down the number of registered voters in the constituency from 94,356 in 2014 to 75,774 this time, which is again a challenge for the contesting candidates.

For the record, there are 11 candidates in the fray — five from political parties and six independents, including former bureaucrat B.D. Hiregoudar. As the JD(S) candidate withdrew from the contest after the deadline was over, his name will appear on the ballot paper.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/triangular-contest-likely-in-karnataka-west-graduates-constituency/article32943694.ece
134,2020/10/26,Why a transparent evaluation system is important for entrance exams,"In the light of the doubts cast over the evaluation system of NEET-2020, a former academic writes about why it is important to have a transparent evaluation system

Aspersions, whether genuine or not, have been cast on the evaluation system of NEET 2020. To convince the public of the credibility of this system, the National Testing Agency (NTA) should explain its process of evaluation, with its built-in checks and so on.

One of the assets of Anna University (AU) is its entrance exam system, which was at its peak in the later half of 1990s. Though admission for all courses of AU was done through appropriate entrance exams, the Tamil Nadu Professional Courses Entrance Exam (TNPCEE) — designed by the then Vice Chancellor Dr. V.C. Kulandaisamy at the behest of the then Chief Minisiter M.G. Ramachandran — at the +2 level was the most conspicuous. Introduced in 1984, it had one paper each for engineering, medicine and agriculture. From the next year, the exam consisted of one paper each in math, biology, physics and chemistry (with general knowledge).

Changes introduced

From 1995, the third paper was renamed physical sciences, as there was some confusion about whether it was one paper or two. Other changes included shifting of exam dates to April from June (resulting in sudden spurt in the number of candidates), introduction of ‘jumbled versions’ of question papers (without informing the candidate which version he/she was handling, and in which answers were also jumbled in later years), OMR response sheets and revised computerised evaluation.

All these features helped the entire process to be carried out with precision. To ensure an error-free system, two percent of the answer sheet were randomly chosen after the computerised evaluation. These were then manually manually evaluated by a team of senior faculty members and compared with the result given by the computer. From 1994 to 2000, the years I was in charge of the entrance exams and admissions unit, there was no mismatch. The public were also aware of this policy and therefore had full faith in the system. If the NTA has any such built-in checks in its evaluation process, it would be a good idea to reveal it so that people can be convinced.

Beating the system

One might wonder if any malpractice is still possible. While copying is eliminated, interchange of response sheets was done at least once during my tenure. A candidate interchanged his response sheets in biology and physical sciences with that of two other candidates. He befriended a student in the same hall, noted down his name, registration number and signature and used those in his exam sheet. The hall superintendent failed to check the response sheet against the hall ticket. He had handed over his response sheets and, when the papers were being arranged, rushed to the superintendent and pleaded to be allowed to correct a mistake in his particulars. When the superintendent obliged, he picked out the other student’s sheet and changed the particulars to his own. When this came to light, his admission to a BDS course was cancelled and it was also discovered that he had used the same modus operandi in his Class 12 board exam as well. Those results were also cancelled.

After this happened, I introduced another guideline for the entrance exams officials that once the candidate hands over the response sheet, it cannot be given back to him/her for any reason. This is only to show that interchange of response sheets is also possible if rules are not strict or not implemented strictly.

135,2020/10/26,Smart garbage monitoring system for local bodies,"Implemented by Haritha Keralam Mission through LSG Department

Waste management and monitoring in all local bodies across the State is set to go the digital way with the implementation of the Smart Garbage Monitoring System being developed by Keltron.

The system, which will be implemented by the Haritha Keralam Mission through the Local Self Government Department, is aimed at monitoring the entire process of waste management, from door-to-door collection to recycling or processing of the same.

The LSG Department had last week approved the project, formulated based on existing systems in a handful of local bodies. According to officials of the Haritha Keralam Mission, they had looked at the Smart Trivandrum mobile application being used in Thiruvananthapuram Corporation and similar applications in Taliparamba and Vadakara municipalities to come up with an improved version that covers the entire waste management process.

“Now, we have the Haritha Karma Senas that are active in several of the panchayats and municipalities having door-to-door collection of waste. Through the Smart Garbage Monitoring System, residents as well as officials will have all the information regarding waste collection and processing at their fingertips,” says Ajaykumar P., technical officer of the Haritha Keralam Mission’s waste management division.

“For instance, Haritha Sena volunteers can identify the houses from which waste have to be collected or the house owners who have to pay the user fee, whereas the residents can know the date of the next collection or raise request for inoculum which is used in kitchen bins,” he says.

From the people’s point of view, one of the important features of the mechanism will be the complaint resolution system, by which a complaint will be forwarded automatically to the higher authority if the responsible official at the local level does not take action on time. They can also identify the nearest material recovery facility and the time of functioning through the application.

At the local body level, it will enable the officials to have a clear picture of the amount of waste collected in a specific period, the amount recycled or sold and the amount of non-biodegradable waste used for road tarring. The funds for the development of the software are being provided from the Suchitwa Mission, while the respective local bodies will take care of the recurring expenses from their Plan fund.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/smart-garbage-monitoring-system-for-local-bodies/article32947640.ece

137,2020/10/26,Tigress captured in Wayanad,"It had triggered panic among local residents

A tigress that triggered panic among local residents at the Chettipambra, Anapanthi, and Cheeyambam Ezhupathi Moonnu areas near Pulpally, under the Chethalayalth forest range of the South Wayanad Forest Division, was captured from a tribal settlement on Sunday morning.

The tigress, aged about nine years, had triggered panic for the past three weeks after it killed about 15 goats in the area. Its capture has come as relief to the villagers.

A forest team, led by Chethalyath forest range officer T. Sasikumar, had set up two traps at Chettipambra and near a tribal settlement at Ezhupathi Moonnu on October 8 and October 11. The animal walked into the trap at Ezhupathi Moonnu early on Sunday.

The predator was shifted to the nearby forest station at Irulam on a tractor on a directive of South Wayanad Divisional Forest Officer P. Ranjith Kumar.

Later, the big cat was examined by a team of veterinary experts led by Arun Zachariah, senior forest veterinary surgeon.

The animal seemed to be healthy, except for a broken canine tooth, department sources said. It was under observation to identify infection to its internal organs.

The animal is identified as a resident of the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, home to more than half the number of tigers present in the State.

A 10-year-old tiger was captured nearly 100 metres from the area last year after it attacked a forest watcher and killed many domestic animals.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ts5th6/article32947614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27tvwytiger,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tigress-captured-in-wayanad/article32947599.ece
138,2020/10/26,Kerala Cong. splinter groups lean towards UDF,"They are keen to fill the void created by the exit of Jose K. Mani

Keen to fill the void created by the exit of Jose K. Mani, two smaller parties from central Travancore that share the legacy of the Kerala Congress have come forward to align with the United Democratic Front (UDF).

While a secretariat meeting of the Kerala Congress has entrusted its chairman P.C. Thomas to negotiate with the Congress-led coalition, the Kerala Janapaksham led by P.C. George, MLA, will discuss the proposal at a meeting in Kottayam on November 1.

Confirming the move, Mr.Thomas said the party had decided to pull out of the National Democratic Alliance and looked forward to join the UDF ahead of the local body elections in December.

“The UDF leadership has extended us an invitation through informal channels in view of the exit of Mr. Mani from the coalition. With UDF chairman Ramesh Chennithala openly expressing the coalition’s willingness to take us on board, formal discussions will begin in a few days,” he said.

Mr.Thomas said party workers were disappointed with the NDA in view of the unending wait for adequate representation in the government led by the coalition. “The Kerala Congress had been promised representation on a few corporations and boards, including the Rubber Board. It has been two years since then and we are not in a position to wait any more,” he said.

Meanwhile, sources said a few leaders with the KC(M) faction led by P.J. Joseph had expressed concern over the entry of Mr.Thomas into the coalition. The move is attributed to the anxiety that Mr.Thomas, son of Kerala Congress founder-leader P.T. Chacko, may undermine their respective positions, especially in case of a merger of the KC groups.

The Congress, though unsure about taking Mr. Thomas into the UDF fold, wants to woo voters of central Travancore who are disenchanted with Mr.Mani through Mr.Thomas, also from the dominant Christian community.

Meanwhile, resentment is brewing within the Congress over a purported move to induct the Kerala Janapaksham into the coalition. Two days ago, the Poonjar block committee of the party even adopted a resolution seeking not to cooperate with the veteran legislator.

While Mr.George seemed favourably disposed towards joining the UDF, he remained non-committal about closing a deal ahead of the elections. “I have been approached by a few UDF leaders with an offer to join the coalition. The matter will be taken up for discussion at a meeting of the party leadership in Kottayam on November 1,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-cong-splinter-groups-lean-towards-udf/article32947562.ece

140,2020/10/26,Kerala move against CBI draws fire,"Congress, BJP oppose withdrawing general consent for probe by the agency

A purported move by the government to withdraw the general consent given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to operate in its territory appears to have become an irritant in the State’s arguably fraught relationship with the Centre.

If implemented, Kerala will join a line-up of non-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled States — West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra — to ban the agency from launching investigations on its own and functioning in their respective jurisdiction without the explicit consent of the provincial government.

BJP’s charge

Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan had on Saturday decried the government’s reported plan. The State government wanted to fend off the CBI to cover up high-level corruption and save top leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) from being investigated for recurrent political murders in northern Kerala, he said.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) would oppose the move.

He said the Left Democratic Front wanted to conceal cases of corruption and other high crimes, including playing second fiddle to gold smugglers.

State secretary of the Communist Party of India (CPI) Kanam Rajendran said the Central government had without compunction used the CBI to destabilise non-BJP ruled States, and Kerala was no exception. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) was aware of the plot to use the central law enforcement agency to discredit the government in an election year.

The CPI had on October 23 requested the LDF to recommend to the government to withdraw the free run accorded to the CBI under the provisions of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act. It clearly states that law and order and crime investigation are State subjects.

The CPI(M) had on Friday formally requested the government to explore legal options to restrain the CBI from acting on its own volition in Kerala.

The CBI could probe local cases or chargesheet suspects only with the permission of the State administration. The agency cannot act on its own accord even in cases involving scheduled offences, it said.

The CBI would not require the consent of the State government only in investigations ordered by the Supreme Court or the High Court, the party felt.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cjnnvp/article32947456.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27Kanam-Rajendran,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-move-against-cbi-draws-fire/article32947457.ece
141,2020/10/26,Minister inaugurates food safety lab in Kannur,"Facility to benefit people in Kasaragod, Kannur, and Wayanad districts

The Regional Analytical Laboratory of the Food Safety Department has been inaugurated in Kannur.

Health Minister K.K. Shailaja, inaugurating the laboratory recently, said that with the commissioning of the lab, the people of the region could avail of its services without having to go all the way to Kozhikode, as was done until now.

People in Kasaragod, Kannur, and Wayanad districts used to rely on the Kozhikode Regional Analytical Lab to test food items, drinking water, milk, and oil. As a solution to this, it was decided to start a new food safety lab in the region, she said.

The lab would start functioning immediately in a rented building as there would be a delay in completing the construction of the lab’s building, she said. Ms. Shailaja said that the lab had been operating on a trial basis since September 23.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/minister-inaugurates-food-safety-lab-in-kannur/article32947366.ece

146,2020/10/26,Govt. hasn’t let down Walayar parents: CM,"‘Cong., BJP trying to weaponise grief of family against govt. ahead of polls’

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said he was not in the habit of cheating any person let alone the anguished parents of the Dalit girls in Walayar.

Mr. Vijayan was responding to the allegation that he had done little to reverse the shoddy investigation that led to the acquittal of three persons suspected to be responsible for the suicide of the sisters within a space of a few days.

The law enforcement had come under intense criticism from across the political spectrum after a special court for the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act acquitted three persons accused of exploiting the girls sexually and abetting their suicide in 2017.

Janayugam, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of India, wrote a scathing opinion piece damning the police for failing to prosecute the case properly.

Mr. Vijayan said the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party were attempting to weaponise the grief of the parents against the government ahead of the elections.

Plea filed in HC

The government had filed an urgent memorandum in the High Court to overturn the verdict and order a reinvestigation. The court had stayed the release of the suspects after it realised the gravity of the government’s plea. Moreover, the government had appointed a commission of inquiry headed by retired district judge P.K. Haneefa to probe the matter. Mr. Haneefa submitted his report, which the government tabled in the Assembly.

Action against officers

Flaws in prosecution and investigation had led to the acquittal of the accused. The government had removed the errant prosecutors and suspended the investigating officers pending inquiry. More stringent action was under way against them.

150,2020/10/26,Farmers in distress due to paddy procurement delay,"Already harvested paddy remains piled up in fields

A delay in the procurement of paddy has put farmers in the district in distress.

Paddy, which has already been harvested including in Kuttanad, remains piled up in fields. On the other hand, a large number of farmers have postponed harvesting following an impasse over procurement.

Earlier, mills decided to keep away from procurement after they failed to reach an agreement with the government. Following this, the government has decided to rope in cooperative societies to procure paddy directly from farmers. However, a lack of storage, among other facilities for cooperative societies in the district has resulted in the delay.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Monday visited paddy fields in Kuttanad and Palakkad and interacted with farmers there. In a statement issued, Mr. Chennithala said he had discussed the issue with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan over telephone. Mr. Chennithala said the Chief Minister had promised to find a solution to the issue on Tuesday.

Mr. Chennithala said that the paddy farmers were facing a huge crisis. “The State government’s decision to entrust cooperative societies with paddy procurement in place of mills has already destroyed large quantities of paddy. Harvested paddy is lying in fields. The thulavarsham (northeast monsoon) is set to begin in the next couple of days. This will result in total crop loss,” Mr. Chennithala said.

Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy has urged the government to immediately intervene in the matter.

Earlier, the August floods had destroyed the additional crop (second crop) in around 3,500 hectares in the district. However, crop in around 5,300 hectares survived the floods. This was the third year in a row, Kuttanad suffered crop loss in the additional crop season. Last year too, torrential downpour clubbed with an increased inflow of water from the eastern districts resulted in bund breaches and flooding, destroying paddy in large tracts. In 2018, back-to-back floods had destroyed the additional crop in its entirety.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/farmers-in-distress-due-to-paddy-procurement-delay/article32946136.ece
151,2020/10/26,No reason to agitate against economic reservation: CM,"‘50% quota for historically deprived classes remains intact’

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said backward class organisations had no reason to go on the warpath against the government over the issue of extending 10% reservation in government jobs to economically disadvantaged persons from socially and educationally privileged forward communities.

Mr. Vijayan said the organisations should realise that the 50% reservation for historically deprived Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and Backward Class communities remained intact.

The 10% reservation extended to financially disadvantaged persons from the forward communities did not infringe on the Constitutionally mandated 50% job quota for backward class and SC/ST communities.

The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha (KPMS) and the SNDP Yogam had opposed the move vehemently. They had accused the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government of betraying the interests of historically marginalised communities. Leaders of the organisations are scheduled to meet on October 28 in Kochi to chart out their future course of action.

A marker of backwardness

Mr. Vijayan said the organisations had no ground for any grouse. Article 579 of the LDF manifesto promised social justice for all. He said all political parties had recognised poverty as a marker of backwardness.

The Lok Sabha had passed the Constitution (124th Amendment) Bill, 2019, with an overwhelming majority to succour the poor among forward castes without diminishing the existing quota for SC/ST and backward class communities. Forward caste candidates from families that have an annual income of less than ₹4 lakh will be eligible for this reservation. The quota would not apply to job aspirants from families that possess more than 2 acres of land in grama panchayats; more than 75 cents in municipalities or more than 50 cents in Corporation limits.

The State government had implemented the 10% reservation in Devasom Boards.

LDF convener A. Vijayaraghavan had also cautioned the IUML and others against agitating over a “non-issue.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-reason-to-agitate-against-economic-reservation-cm/article32946135.ece
152,2020/10/26,"Judicial panel, trial court blame Walayar parents","‘They knew about the sexual assault of elder girl, but spoke out only after death of younger girl’

Despite knowing about the sexual molestation of their elder daughter, the parents of the deceased Walayar girls, who are on a warpath demanding justice, remained silent on the attack till the death of the younger daughter, inculpated a judicial commission and trial court.

It was about two months after the death of the younger daughter that they raised the allegation of sexual abuse to the police. If the parents were “really bothered about the welfare of the daughter, definitely they would have taken action against the accused, at least after the death of the victim,” noted the trial court, which acquitted all the accused in the case.

The observations of the trial court were quoted in the report of the State government-appointed P.K. Haneefa Commission, which was accessed by The Hindu.

Tardy probe, prosecution

The commission had held sub-inspector P.C. Chacko and prosecutors Latha Jayaraj and Jalaja Madhavan responsible for the tardy investigation and prosecution.

It was to Dy.SP Sojan that the parents made the statements that the mother had “witnessed the penetrative sexual assault committed by the accused on the victim.” The long delay in the parents giving the statements against the accused “itself is a doubting circumstance with regard to their deposition,” the court noted.

Mr. Sojan deposed to the commission that the parents were aware that the accused, Valiya Madhu and Kutty Madhu, had sexually assaulted the elder girl. However, he said he refrained from registering a case against them for not informing the police about the crime, apprehending that they would not give evidence against the accused if booked, the panel noted.

Statement retracted

Though the mother had given the statement to the police implicating Valiya Madhu and Kutty Madhu, she retracted her statement before a magistrate by dropping the name of one of the accused, the court noted.

Though the father deposed that he did not file a complaint against the accused, considering the future of the victim, it was later revealed that he had not cited any such reason to the police. Though he told the police that he saw the accused inappropriately touching the girl, he subsequently denied it. The contradictory statements showed that even at the time of recording of his statement, he had no case that the girl was abused by the accused, the trial court noted.

The court found that the statements of some of the witnesses were either fabricated or gathered under compulsion against the accused to put him behind the bar. It also noted that the prosecution failed miserably in proving the charges against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/httjle/article32949665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27TVWALAYAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/judicial-panel-trial-court-blame-walayar-parents/article32945352.ece
153,2020/10/26,NSS calls for change in reservation conditions,"New norms must adhere to the concept of equal justice, says forum chief

Taking exception to some of the conditions set by the State government in implementing 10% reservation for the economically backward sections (EWS) among forward communities in government jobs, the Nair Service Society (NSS) has called on the authorities to make urgent intervention and make corrections.

In a statement, G. Sukumaran Nair, general secretary of the community organisation, said the reservation norm for EWS candidates was quite different from those set for other backward classes (OBCs) and SC/ST categories. Against this backdrop, he urged the authorities to make sure that the new norms adhere to the concept of equal justice.

Retrospective effect

Though the Union government had initiated a Constitutional amendment to implement 10% reservation for EWS in forward communities in January 2019, the proposal was approved by the State government only on January 3, 2020. “It further took them eight months to bring changes in the Kerala State and Subordinate Rules (KSSR) for implementing the reservation, despite issuing an order on February 12, 2020. Hence the recruitment done and advice memos issued since January 3, 2020 should be revised to ensure reservation for EWS reservation candidates with retrospective effect,” said Mr. Nair.

In case of vacancies

Further, Rule 15 (a) of the Amendment Act stipulated that the vacancies in the EWS category being reported in a recruitment year need not be left vacant if no candidates are available. The rule further stated that the vacancy can be filled from the general category. “This is against the norm of equal justice as vacancies in OBC and SC/ST categories are left vacant in the event of No Candidate Available (NCA). Hence, notification should be issued for special recruitment to fill NCA vacancies in EWS sections at least twice. If NCA still exists such vacancies should be filled in open competition (general category) from non-reservation communities,” he added.

Mr. Nair also called for a revision in the turn system for EWS category, which stipulates one recruitment for every nine recruitments. “As per the proposed system, EWS candidates will get an appointment only if there are more than nine vacancies. The turn should be revised for the recruitment to the last grade and other categories,” Mr. Nair added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nss-calls-for-change-in-reservation-conditions/article32945316.ece

Pre-primary classes

Kilikonchal, a programme for pre-primary students, will be telecast on Saturdays and Sundays. This will be re-arranged soon.

Owing to time constraints, some subjects for higher secondary classes and some language classes for upper primary students will be telecast on weekends too for the benefit of all students.

155,2020/10/26,Kerala universities to admit students to distance-education courses,"Govt. nod following HC stay on provisions of Sree Narayana Guru Open University ordinance

State universities have initiated steps to enrol students for their distance-education courses. The move brings to an end the uncertainty over the prospects of open and distance learning (ODL) this academic year and follows the government’s advice to gear up for the admission process.

The promulgation of the ordinance for the Sree Narayana Guru Open University (SNGOU) had virtually barred other universities from conducting distance education programmes and private registrations as such domains were brought under the purview of the SNGOU. However, the recent stay by the Kerala High Court of the ordinance provisions dealt a blow to the government’s hopes of fully operationalising the fledgling university.

Official sources now concede that the court order has made it unlikely for the SNGOU to start any academic programmes this year, and the turn of events has paved the way for other universities to continue with their distance education programmes for one more year. The developments have also stalled the necessity for existing students to migrate to the new university midway through their courses.

UGC node

Currently, only the University of Kerala has obtained recognition from the University Grants Commission to offer programmes under the ODL mode in the 2020-21 academic year.

R. Vasanthagopal, Director, School of Distance Education, Kerala University, said the admissions for UG and PG courses were under way. Registrations can be done online till October 31 and November 18 respectively. The university admits 10,500 students for its ODL courses on an average annually.

The University of Calicut, which attracts the highest number of distance education learners in the State, has sought the UGC nod for offering such programmes. The university recently submitted its application after the apex body had extended deadline for applications till October 31, Vice Chancellor M.K. Jayaraj said.

The university admits close to 40,000 students on an average to its ODL courses annually and currently has around 1.25 lakh students pursuing various programmes in the ODL mode.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-universities-to-admit-students-to-distance-education-courses/article32945234.ece

157,2020/10/26,CPI opposes “anti-media” police amendment,"The Communist Party of India, in an article in its newspaper, expressed serious apprehensions about the proposed executive order.

The Communist Party of India (CPI) has expressed concern that the recent decision of the government to amend the Kerala Police Act, 2011, could reverse the course on media freedom, muzzle free speech and jeopardise civil liberties.

Last on Wednesday, the government had decided to give the law enforcement more teeth to crack down on the origination and dissemination of defamatory content on varied media platforms.

The administration had justified the move by casting it against the backdrop of several high-profile incidents of defamation of women on social media.

The Cabinet had resolved to request the Kerala Governor Arif Muhammad Khan to promulgate an ordinance to make the crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine of ₹10,000 or both.

The new section (118-A) purportedly empowers the police to scour the media and register cases on their own volition in the event of detection of a cognisable offence under the relevant section.

It was unclear whether the CPI Ministers had objected to the ordinance in the Cabinet. However, the party's newspaper, Janayugam, has expressed serious apprehensions about the proposed executive order.

Sources said the article was a bellwether of the CPI's stance in the matter. The party felt that civil society at large and media in particular viewed the proposal with scepticism.

The CPI felt that the government should not ignore the apprehension that the move to bestow the police with the power to examine published content critically and register cases even in the absence of a specific complaint was patently anti-democratic.

Granting the police such questionable freedom might advance the cause of authoritarianism. The High Court had pointed out in May that existing laws were sufficient to curb such malpractice, the party pointed out.

The CPI said that discreditable conduct and extra-judicial action often marked the history of law enforcement in the country. Hence, Kerala's fears about the proposed amendment were not misplaced. The government should arrive at a general agreement with all stakeholders before forging ahead with the amendment, it said.

Journalist unions, opposition parties and human rights activists had decried the proposal earlier. The government has maintained that their fears were incorrect. It said that the amendment targeted slanderous social media and online content, and did not aspire to curb reportage, political satire or commentary.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cpi-opposes-anti-media-police-amendment/article32942220.ece

Ten-year-old K Mahashweta, a Class V student from Tiruppur, has acted in four Malayalam short films and has already won two international awards for her acting skills. The latest one is the Best Child/Young Actress award for her role in the short film Grandma Toy at the Las Vegas Movie Awards 2020. In the film, she plays an orphaned child who helps senior citizens who are abandoned at old age homes. “Why do people leave their parents at such places instead of caring for them at their homes?” asks Mahashweta. Grandma Toy, directed by Gajendra Vava, was released on YouTube in June this year and has crossed over a lakh views.

The short fetched Mahashweta the award in the category Five to 12 years that had contestants from 100 countries. “I got an opportunity to work alongside senior actors in Malayalam and it was a great learning experience. I want to do films in Tamil too,” says the actor who has enrolled for online acting classes.

“All the films she has done so far had social messages,” says P U Krishnan, her father with visible pride. Last year, she won the award at Los Angeles Movie Awards for short film Whom Should I tell (Aarodu Parayum?) themed on how mobile phones come in the way of parenting. She played a girl left uncared for as her parents sat glued to their phones. Her other short film Sketches of Life captured emotional trauma that families went through during the Maradu flat demolition in Kochi.

Krishnan says Mahashweta’s work is getting noticed by artistes in the industry.

“Actor Navya Nair put up a post on Facebook appreciating her performance. When I was young, I joined CG Ravi drama troupe but couldn’t go any further in acting because of lack of support.

Yasha Shivakumar is the latest entrant into the Kannada film industry. She makes her début with Padavipoora directed by Hariprasad Jayannaa and produced by Yograj Bhat and Ravi Shamanur.

Having studied engineering, she stepped into the world of glamour through modelling. Soon she was participating in beauty pageants and is the winner of the Miss Bangalore 2019 and Miss Karnataka International 2019. She was also crowned Miss Glory of Galaxy pageant held in Mumbai in 2019.

Yasha is acting in a Tulu film, Raj Sounds And Lights, for which she is currently shooting. “The film is made by the same team that worked on Ondu Motteya Kathe with Raj B Shetty,” says Yasha, who is trained in Bharatnatya, Kathak, Bollywood and folk dance.

Yasha believes dance is helping her acting career. “I realised I had no stage fright and the abhinaya in dance helps me emote on camera.”

In Padavipoorva she will share the screen with Pruthvi Shamanur and Anjali Anish. The film has lyrics by Yogaraj Bhat and music by Arjun Janya, with cinematography by Santhosh Rai Pataaje. “I got my first modelling assignment in my final year of college, that was when I met Yogaraj sir. I auditioned for the film last year and forgot all about it. I was pleasantly surprised when Yogaraj called and told me that I would fit the character to the T.”

The young dancer says she could not have dreamt of a better film début. “I felt at home working with both the teams.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/6uv1p5/article32943839.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PSX20200712132753,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/yasha-shivakumar-is-the-latest-entrant-in-kannada-cinema/article32943841.ece
160,2020/10/26,Rajeev Kanakala makes a beginning with YouTube channel Manaswini Movie Magic Creations,"The actor talks about this new initiative and why his father Devadas Kanakala will always be his inspiration

A few weeks ago, Telugu television viewers were pleasantly surprised to see Rajeev Kanakala’s cameo in two television serials Matti Gajulu and No. 1 Kodalu on Gemini and Zee Telugu channels respectively. That marks Rajeev’s return to television, after all he had begun his journey as television actor in the early ’90s . He cherishes the memories; “I feel nostalgic remembering my good old television days”, but insists this is not his comeback. “The two roles were just a guest appearance but people think I am back on television. I did it (Matti Gajulu) only for my friend Vinod Bala garu,” he says.

Idea takes shape

Keeping him busy now is his new project Manaswini Movie Magic Creations launched in June during the lockdown. A YouTube Channel/production house, Manaswini will serve as a platform for short/independent film makers, educative and entertaining films, web series and interviews. Glad that his idea has finally taken shape despite the lockdown, Rajeev calls it a new beginning. “I had to start somewhere, so finally I took the initiative and started the channel named after my daughterManaswini. We want to develop it into a platform for new generation filmmakers wanting to tell different stories,” he says adding, “It might also be useful in the long run for my son.” Your Attention Please — A VIP’s Journey, a celebrity-based talk show hosted by Suma Amujuri on the channel has featured actors Srikanth, Aryan Rajesh and Siva Balaji.

Interestingly this is not Rajeev’s first company. He and wife Suma had launched Suma Rajeev Creations, a television production house that produced serials like Nenu Ayana Athadu, Kevvu Keka, Luck Kikku. Now he relies on that experience.

Rajeev’s career in films (he has acted in 60+ films so far) has been through different phases but even his small roles make an impact. “I got a good name” he says of his film roles and gives examples of his short, but memorable, roles. “People still remember me from Janata Garage (11-minute role) or Athadu (five-minute role). ” He was a powerhouse performer with character roles, but when he began doing lead roles in low-budget films, his film career slumped. He took a break from films in 2012 and concentrated on Suma Rajeev Creations. There he found that running the enterprise as a one-man show was tough; the production house incurred losses. Now he hopes to start afresh.

On the film front, he is currently doing two projects Love Story and a Venkatesh-starrer Narappa.

Support in family

Rajeev’s family has been closely associated with the Telugu entertainment industry. His (late) parents Devadas Kanakala (director) and Lakshmidevi were prominent acting coaches, his wife Suma is a popular television personality and his (late) sister Srilakshmi too was a television actor.

He had not recovered from his father Devadas Kanakala’s death from last year when another personal tragedy struck the family with the death of Srilakshmi in April. “I am yet to come out of the tragedies; I am only trying to divert my attention and hope time will heal,” he says.

An acting guru, Devdas Kanakala remains an inspiration to him, he now misses that ‘friend’ with whom he could chat endlessly. “Most of his students knew that he was a good cook,” he says of his father. “ He was a humanitarian and happy person who made others also happy. He was known for his determination and focus.” Before signing off, he reveals his father’s philosophy ‘Be sincere, work hard and keep going in life’ helps him get through hard times.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/wvmnzg/article32943484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym27rajeev,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/rajeev-kanakala-on-his-youtube-channel-manaswini-movie-magic-creations-and-his-late-father-devdas-kanakala/article32943487.ece
161,2020/10/26,Ishaan Khatter and Tanya Maniktala talk about ‘A Suitable Boy’,"They give us a peek behind the scenes saying there is nothing like a cell phone to snap you out of character

After playing Madhukar in the tale of star-crossed lovers, Dhadak (2018), Ishaan Khatter is again in love with the wrong woman in Mira Nair’s adaptation of A Suitable Boy. Ishaan plays Maan, a spoilt young man, who falls in love with a courtesan, Saeeda Bai, played by Tabu. The 24-year-old actor marvels at the level of detail required in a period drama. “I remember the conversations about which cycle is more time appropriate,” Ishaan says over a video call. “The best thing about acting in a period drama is being allowed a gateway into a time when I did not exist. The worst thing is having a cell phone on set. It immediately snaps you out of character!”

Tanya Maniktala, who plays Lata, the girl who is courted by three unsuitable boys, agrees. The clothes also were a big plus for Tanya. “Every day I would be wondering what I was going to wear,” the 23-year-old says. The wig Lata wore created some problems for Tanya. “That was excruciating as the extensions were clipped on to my scalp.”

The language in the show, Ishaan said was very specific. “If we let an ‘okay’ slip, Mira-di would holler, ‘Okay’ is not a thing, it is should be ‘alright’!’ She would change from absolutely enjoying the take to being appalled in a jiffy if we said okay or a blah blah…”

“Like Ishaan said, you had to be very mindful of your speech,” Tanya agrees. “I tend to mumble a lot. I had a wonderful diction coach. In that period, the words were clearly enunciated. There was clarity, a lot of thought went into what was said. There was a teherav (stillness) then unlike now.”

Talking about his character, Ishaan says, “Fleshing out the character was a collaboration between Mira-di and us. We had multiple readings. It was a satisfying experience to work on Maan. Mira-di is gracious and giving. Once she was set on me for the part, she let me have him. She viewed Maan in a certain way and she was very clear about it. But she enjoyed the interplay and what we would create everyday on set.”

Ishaan says a lot of his character came from relationships with the co-actors. “Mira-di has the knack of bringing people together. It is one of the most wonderful gifts she has a film maker and a leader. She brings not only actors but the entire team together to create a certain energy, a synergy and the character is a result of all of that.

Tanya chimes in saying, “Having a director like Mira-di is great. It is an honour to be working with her. She lets you have fun, she lets you play with the character. She also knows what she wants and she makes sure that she gets it out of you. Sometimes you don't realise the potential that a scene might have, but she would add the extra dimension and an extra layer to it. And everything becomes crystal clear and you wonder ‘Oh, how could I not have seen that?’”

Actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui is set to star in director Jaideep Chopra’s Sangeen, featuring his Sacred Games co-star Elnaaz Norouzi, the makers announced on Monday.

The film will be shot across London and Mumbai and will go on floors in January 2021.

Siddiqui described Sangeen as a “unique film” and said he is thrilled to be essaying a “thought-provoking character”.

“I am looking forward to teaming up once again with Elnaaz Norouzi after ‘Sacred Games’ The script is an experimental one and I am sure Jaideep Chopra will do full justice to it and together we will be able to discover something novel,” the actor said in a statement.

Iran-born Norouzi said she is honoured to reunite with Siddiqui after the popular Netflix crime-drama series.

“Sangeen is an incredible script, a role I’ve always secretly dreamt of essaying as an actor. I am looking forward to bringing that complex character to life with Jaideep sir who has written it so skilfully,” she added.

Sangeen is jointly produced by Gurjit Singh of Golden Era Films and Ankit Khanna of AK Projekts.

Chopra, who has also written the film, said he could not think of anyone else but Siddiqui for the part.

“He is an actor par excellence and I couldn’t think of any one more deserving than him to bring a sense of authenticity to my film. Elnaaz Norouzi has an innate creative acumen and this film will showcase her in a brand-new light within the cinematic ecosphere,” Chopra said.

Singer-songwriter-rapper Raftaar, who worked on Siddiqui’s Manto, has been roped in for the film’s music.

165,2020/10/26,UGC’s advisory on reservation roster raises questions on implementation,"Sometimes, even in govt. colleges rules couldn’t be followed, says professors

The University Grants Commission has issued an advisory to registrars of institutions to strictly comply with the reservation rules of the Central government. Institutions have been instructed to upload and update the reservation roster on their websites periodically.

The universities must also ensure that the roster system is followed by colleges affiliated to it. The institutions are expected to upload data pertaining to students as well as faculty and non-teaching staff.

University professors say the reservation roster is followed strictly by State-run universities and its departments, constituent colleges and government colleges in admission of students. With colleges offering two shifts, even in government colleges concerns about reservation roster for faculty had been raised.

The UGC’s periodic advisory cannot be applied to self-financing colleges as they face many hurdles, say professors. The high faculty attrition and the offer of new courses are two major factors.

A journalism professor in a State university gave the example of how when Visual Communication was introduced 15 years ago there were not enough faculty to teach the subject. The universities permitted colleges to recruit faculty, by relaxing not only reservation norms but also qualification requirements, in the interest of students. Fifteen years later, the relaxation on qualification requirement was revoked. “But not any more. Now there is a sufficient pool of teachers,” he pointed out.

Several violations

At Anna University it is a different situation, however. Senior faculty point to several violations in student admissions as well. “So far, even admission details have not been made transparent. Over the years candidates have been admitted under the NRI quota based on the approval of the Syndicate. Where the class strength must be 60, it has been violated to admit as many as 10 or 12 more students. The explanation is that students might vacate the seat when they get a preferred course in either medicine or one of the IITs. These seats are then allotted to the NRIs,” a faculty explained.

Sometime ago, the appointment of 200 faculty over a period of a decade raised concerns as not only was the reservation roster system violated but the appointments did not follow even the mandated qualification requirement.

“Until recently we did not follow even the All India Council of Technical Education norms. It is only now that the university is applying for NAAC and NBA accreditation. Each department must apply independently. Now we are required to provide the details which will be verified by the accreditation authorities,” said a senior professor.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ugcs-advisory-on-reservation-roster-raises-questions-on-implementation/article32947731.ece
166,2020/10/26,An OTT platform for short filmmakers,"Shortflix to help budding moviemakers

Short filmmakers now have an exclusive OTT (over the top) platform, Shortflix, to showcase their creativity. It was launched recently to help upcoming filmmakers to stream their short films and webseries.

Their passion towards short films and cinema led S.S. Bharanidharan and P. Senthilkumar, who were in different professions, to start Shortflix in 2019 as an alternative to major streaming sites that focus on feature films.

Mr. Bharanidharan, a singer and one of the directors of Shortflix, said it was launched before the pandemic to encourage independent short filmmakers and has now hosted nearly 100 short films in south Indian languages and Hindi.

The idea was to create a viewership for quality content and offer ‘watch-on-the-go’ facility on a user-friendly platform. Best short films were also premiered in multiplexes last year.

“We plan to add international short films in various languages such as English, Korean and Spanish from next month. There are also plans to host web series with 15 to 20-minute episodes in the platform also available as a mobile application,” he said.

Several films that are produced at a low budget and go unreleased due to unavailability of theatres would also be streamed through Shortflix soon. Mr. Senthilkumar, one of the founders and a builder by profession, said, “I joined the venture for the love of movies and short films. We want to streamline short films as an industry and create revenue generation model for aspiring film makers.” The OTT platform now provides free content and the team is exploring possibility of introducing ‘pay view’ with a nominal fee of ₹25 for premium content.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/an-ott-platform-for-short-filmmakers/article32947694.ece

DMK president M.K. Stalin will no longer be able to step outside and go anywhere in the State as women are waiting to give him a befitting reply for supporting a person [Thirumavalavan] who has insulted women, BJP president L. Murugan said.

“Dear Mr. Stalin, our mothers, sisters are waiting to give a befitting reply to you at the right time. Wherever you go from now, my mothers, my sisters are waiting to give their own style of reply to you. You will no longer be able to step outside, or go anywhere,” Mr. Murugan said at an event at the party headquarters here on Monday.

Mr. Murugan said the DMK was directly supporting someone who had insulted women. “His job is to just support these people,” Mr. Murugan charged. “The BJP is a party that respects and worships women. Some [other parties] are insulting women,” he claimed. He again accused the DMK of supporting the YouTube channel, Karuppar Kootam.

When asked about the Manusmriti, Mr. Murugan claimed the book did not exist and that a smokescreen was being created about it. “How can you ban something that is not there? Where is the proof of the book? There is no Manu needhi in India, only the Indian Constitution. The Government functions on the basis of the Constitution and nothing else,” he said.

170,2020/10/26,"AIADMK government reduced NEET reservation to 7.5%, says Stalin","“Justice Kalaiyarasan had recommended 10% reservation.”

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Monday alleged that the AIADMK government reduced to 7.5% the horizontal reservation for NEET-qualified State government school students in admission to undergraduate medical courses, even though Justice Kalaiyarasan had recommended 10% reservation.

Addressing a family wedding of a party functionary, he said the government was not able to get the Governor’s assent even for the bill that had sought to given just 7.5% reservation. “Forty days have passed since the bill was adopted in the Assembly. We waited for the Governor to give his nod, but he is yet to give it,” he said.

Mr Stalin said the government had sought four weeks to take a decision on the bill and by delaying the consent he only intented to dilute the issue. “That was why we organised a demonstration and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami accused us of politicising the issue. But the AIADMK is only interested in making commission,” he charged.

Mr Stalin said the AIADMK government should be removed to protect the interest of the state. “The 2021 Assembly elections have provided us an opportunity to complete the task and let us make use of it,” he further said.

In a separate statement, he urged Mr Palaniswami to bring pressure on the Centre to implement reservation in the medical seats surrendered to the Central pool by the state government.

“If the BJP government refuses to implement it, the Chief Minister should declare that he would not form an alliance with the BJP in the Assembly elections,” he said.

Mr Stalin alleged that reservation could not be implemented because of the stand of the BJP government in the Supreme Court and failure of the AIADMK government to place concrete arguments.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ct2oh8/article32943662.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-government-reduced-neet-reservation-to-75-says-stalin/article32943663.ece

The Dasara Mandapam near the temple complex came alive with a flurry of activity late in the evening with the venue playing host to the spectacular Sri Ram Leela Mahotsavam.

174,2020/10/26,TRS Govt failed on all fronts: Kishan Reddy,"To participate in campaign in Dubbak

Union Minister of State for Home and senior BJP leader G.Kishan Reddy on Monday charged the TRS government of having failed in COVID-19 pandemic control and mitigation, relief and rehabilitation during the recent floods and for being unable to construct two-bedroom housing in the twin cities and in the districts.

In an informal chat with media persons, Mr. Reddy also observed that the forthcoming GHMC polls will be fought mainly on the issue of construction of free two-bedroom housing. He expressed the confidence that the party candidate Raghunandan Rao will emerge victorious in the Dubbak bye-election and accused the ruling TRS party of getting “frustrated” because of the people’s support to the BJP.

Mr. Reddy, who rushed to Siddipet on Monday evening to extend support to the family of the party candidate, has objected the police behavior at Siddipet and its violation of election code. He said party incharge Jitender Reddy was sent to Hyderabad by the police and charged that the TRS was misusing the official machinery.

Noting that searching the houses without search warrant is highly objectionable, the Union Minister of State for Home said Mr. Raghunandan Rao is being targeted and harassed by police. “Never before has official machinery been misused like this by any previous government. We will take this issue to the notice of Election Commission, Union government and party central leadership,” he said expressing confidence that ECI will do justice. He referred to transfer of Collector by ECI on the complaints that he was favouring ruling party.

Mr. Reddy said he would be participating in the election campaign in the next few days.

Mr. Reddy condemned attack on Bandi Sanjay and other leaders. Party leaders also claimed Home Minister Amit Shah had telephoned party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar to enquire about the incident.

Meanwhile Mr. Bandi Sanjay has alleged that police behaved like goondas and threw him into the van forcibly by catching his neck.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5pr78v/article32894733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KISHANREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trs-govt-failed-on-all-fronts-kishan-reddy/article32947635.ece

Post-graduate students from Gandhi Medical College threatened to boycott duties if non-COVID services do not resume at the State government hospital from November 1. The junior doctors stated that they are losing out on clinical exposure from the past seven months. Over 550 junior doctors pursue Post-Graduation (PG) there.

From the end of March, only COVID-19 patients are being admitted at the tertiary care centre. Starting from newborns to the elderly , all COVID patients with any health complication such as cancer, kidney failure, are treated at the hospital. House surgeons (MBBS interns), PG students also known as junior doctors, faculty, nurses, Class-IV workers, are engaged in attending to only COVID-19 patients. As on October 25, 402 out of 1,890 beds were occupied at the hospital.

In a representation addressed to the hospital’s superintendent Dr M. Raja Rao, Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA) members stated that resumption of non-COVID services will help patients suffering from diseases other than COVID-19. President of the association Dr V. Naveen said that as part of the PG course, they attend to patients with various health complications, discuss intricacies of cases.

“Now,we are attending only COVID-19 cases. We are not gaining expertise in other health complications. Why should PGs only from Gandhi Medical College lose out on the crucial clinical exposure?,” questioned Dr Naveen. The junior doctors stated that this could affect their final examinations.

Earlier, the State Health department too has announced plans to resume non-COVID services at the hospital. At the end of September, the State Health Minister Eatala Rajender has directed officials to resume non-COVID services at the hospital.

If patients with complications other than COVID-19 were to be attended too, additional resources such as diagnostic machines are needed as same equipment cannot be used to attend COVID and non-COVID patients. The junior doctors said that old patients with serious complication who consulted them have called to enquire when can they visit for follow-up consultation or treatment.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/gandhi-jr-docs-seek-non-covid-services-threaten-boycott-of-duty/article32946849.ece
176,2020/10/26,"Congress, BJP condemn police action","BJP trying to gain sympathy, says Harish

Finance Minister T. Harish has charged the BJP with trying to get sympathy and playing games as part of that. “BJP is depending on money and playing games. When police raided the house of the relative of Raghunandan Rao the BJP activists behaved like goondas and took away the money. Money being sent to the BJP candidate was caught on the outskirts of Hyderabad. Police checked the house of our party leader Rajanarsu. They have even stopped my vehicle and party candidate S. Sujatha vehicles. Why are BJP leaders not cooperating with the police if they are sincere and right?” asked Mr. Harish Rao while addressing a gathering.

Congress party national spokesperson Dasoju Shravan in a statement said Telangana police had stooped down to such a low level in Dubbak bypolls. He questioned whether the ECI has the guts to take action. He demanded that the entire existing police under Siddipet Commissionerate and Dubbak be transferred immediately to ensure fair and free elections. Former PCC president V. Hanumantha Rao accused the TRS and BJP of playing money politics in Dubbak bye-elections.

The BJP strongly condemned the police raids at the residences of party candidate Raghunandan Rao and his relatives in Siddipet ahead of the bye-elections to Dubbak assembly constituency on November 3.

BJP MLC N. Ramachander Rao, in a statement, termed the police raids “political vendetta”. The TRS party is using police as it is fearing defeat. It was a police high handedness to create fear in the minds of party workers, he alleged and asserted that party candidate Raghunandan Rao would win the seat with thumping majority as people are fed up with the functioning of State government and they are determined to teach a lesson to the ruling TRS. Further, the police did not show any notice or authorization before conducting the raids and even threatened inmates of house, he alleged.

He said Raghunandan Rao on getting information of police raids abandoned his election campaign and rushed home. But the police not only prevented him from entering his own house but also did not allow him to speak to his wife, Rao accused.

Several hours of high drama was witnessed at Siddipet and Dubbak on Monday among police, BJP and TRS activists. Police arrested BJP State president Bandi Sanjay on the outskirts of Siddipet stating that his entry into the town was likely to lead to tensions. He was forcibly sent away to Karimnagar.

In a related development, BJP leaders G. Vivek and Jitender Reddy were arrested and sent back to Hyderabad.

It all started around noon when some police personnel reached the house of Ramgopal Rao, father-in-law of BJP candidate in Dubbak bye-election M. Raghunandan Rao, at Lecturers Colony in Siddipet town. The police also claimed that they conducted raids on houses of eight persons and seized as much as ₹ 18.65 lakh cash. The police also stated that they conducted raids on the residence of TRS leader and Municipal chairman K. Rajanarsu and could not find any amount.

According to information, BJP workers confronted a police personnel, when he was found moving in a “suspicious manner” and found that he was allegedly carrying money in a bag. They alleged that the bag was brought from a neighbouring house. BJP workers charged the police with trying to plant the cash bag at the residence of BJP leaders only to implicate them in election-related cases.

Though police claimed that they have seized the amount from BJP leaders, party activists said that police came with the money and tried to plant it in house of Mr. Ramgopal Rao. They even recorded police coming with money bag and tried to overpower the police and seize the bag. At one video that went viral on social media a party worker is seen snatching the money from the police and showing it to the camera. Hectic activity was witnessed at the residence of Mr. Ramgopal Rao for sometime.

178,2020/10/26,"Widow of cotton trader, who ended life due to alleged harassment by suspended ASI, seeks justice","She accused the ASI of occupying their nearly 300 square yards of land in Bommakal of Karimnagar.

Nagamalla Uma Rani cannot control her tears. While all homes in her neighbourhood of Katta Rampoor here are still engulfed in Dasara celebrations’, she is struggling to come out of the sorrow of her husband Venkata Narsaiah’s suicide.

A cotton trader, Narsaiah, ended his life by consuming poison unable to bear alleged harassment by suspended police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) B. Mohan Reddy and others. “Mohan Reddy’s harassment killed my husband. While other families are having happy moments this Dasara, we are pushed into deep sorrow,” she said on Monday, after performing third month ritual of her husband’s death.

On August 28, her husband was found dead in a room in a lodge in Nacharam in Hyderabad. A suicide note purportedly written by Narsaiah accusing Mohan Reddy of occupying his nearly 300 square yards of land in Bommakal of Karimnagar was found in the room.

In 2012, Narsaiah purchased the plot in Bommakal from a person Nagaraj but some tried to take possession of it claiming that Nagaraj had already sold it to them. Worried about his hard-earned money invested in the plot being lost, Narsaiah approached Mohan Reddy who was working as ASI then for help.

“The ASI convinced my husband to transfer plot rights to him stating that no one would interfere if people know that the plot belonged to him,” Uma Rani recalled. The ASI got the plot first transferred onto the name of one of his associates, Pulgam Mallesh, and later on the name of his wife B. Srilatha.

On learning that Mohan Reddy started construction in that plot, Narsaiah begged him to give back his plot. “Mohan Reddy started dilly-dallying the matter. Meanwhile, the ASI got arrested in 2015 over multiple charges of land grabbing, extortion and corruption.”

The first case, however, against him was that of a private school correspondent Prasada Rao who committed suicide allegedly due to Mohan Reddy’s harassment. For next two years, Mohan Reddy was either in prison or roaming around courts in the cases slapped against him. Mohan Reddy eventually came out on bail and started his ‘activities again’.

“My husband started requesting Mohan Reddy to give back the plot so that he would sell it to clear his debts. For past two years, he met him almost every week,” Uma Rani said. She claimed that her husband realised that Mohan Reddy would never return the plot. Uma Rani and Narsaiah had two daughters. The couple performed their marriages but further slipped into debt.

Selling the plot was the only option for Narsaiah. “My husband died because of Mohan Reddy. At least even after his death, police can help us get back our plot,” Uma Rani pleads with folded hands.

179,2020/10/26,Bringing cheer to farmers in distress,"Police, jail officials and philanthropists celebrate Dasara with ryots

In a rare gesture of social assurance, that too on a festival day, a team of police and jail officials reached out to the farming community and celebrated Dasara with them on Sunday. The women farmers celebrated the occasion with joy as though it was their own brothers who came all the way to great them on the festival day.

Bobbiligam village in Sadashivapet mandal has a large number of farmers, and majority of them are tenants who take land on lease to cultivate crops. For past several years they have been cultivating cotton. This year too they sowed cotton and the recent rains damaged most of the standing crop. As a result these farmers are now deep in debt and many of them are not in a mood to celebrate the festival.

In a move to create confidence among them and assure them that they are with the farmers, Sangareddy Deputy Superintendent of Police P. Sridhar Reddy, District Jail Superintendent Shivakumar Goud, social activist Ch. Uday Kumar from Gummadidala and Puram Pandaiah from Sangareddy came together and gave away new clothes and sweets to the tenant farmers. “We are here to assure you that we are with you in difficult times. Though we could not reach out to everyone, we want to celebrate Dasara with the farmers, who are filling our plates three times a day, and what we have done is our responsibility,” said Mr. Sridhar Reddy.

Mr. Shivakumar Goud said farmers are in distress due to crop loss. “A good tradition of celebrating festival with farmers has started in this remote village. We wish that this tradition could spread to more villages where everyone in society comes out to assure the farming community,” he said.

“We are happy that you came here all the way from Sangareddy to celebrate the festival. It’s like our brothers coming and offering new clothes.

183,2020/10/26,Teething problems continue to haunt Dharani,"Existing land records have many errors, say officials

As the date for the official launch of Dharani — the integrated land records information management system — draws closer, teething problems continue to haunt the new software conceived as one-stop solution for land-related transactions.

A brainchild of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, the State government has decided to integrate the entire land records and host them on the Dharani portal facilitating speedy online transactions avoiding cumbersome procedures which are making the people to run from pillar-to-post. A special session of the legislature was convened to pass the new revenue laws last month and this was followed by stoppage of the registration process until further notice from September first week.

The stoppage of the registration process has raised concerns among the people who paid huge amounts for purchase of lands as the transactions were halted abruptly.

Intense training sessions are being conducted for the field-level staff for smooth operation of Dharani, but doubts persist on the efficacy of the system as there are lapses in the existing land records which need to be rectified before opting for the new system.

The online system envisages on the spot registration and mutation of the documents and handing over of the records the same day itself. Revenue officials are, however, apprehensive that allowing transactions with details available online could result in problems. They suggest that the government continue the existing system of registration till the new system is successfully tested and its efficacy established.

They are pointing out to the discrepancies in the data of Resettlement Register (RSR), which could pose a major problem in the coming days. Moreover, there were numerous instances where the extent of land shown in the revenue records is different from what is recorded in the survey numbers. This was because of pattas distributed to the poor by successive governments without actually showing land. “The extent of land shown in the passbooks is much higher than the actual land available,” an official said.

This apart, there are instances of registration of same land more than once that is set to make it difficult for the field-level officers to update the record. The process is likely to progress smoothly from payment of stamp duty, obtaining digital signatures of the parties concerned and uploading record online. But errors pertaining to the RSR data are likely to show up at the time of endorsement by the approving authority, the tahsildar in case of agricultural lands and sub-registrar for non-agricultural properties.

The record-related problems apart, problems related to connectivity and speed of the network are said to have shown up during the trials conducted. Sources said there were server related problems during the peak hours as a result of which the officials were unable to upload documents in time.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/teething-problems-continue-to-haunt-dharani/article32945462.ece

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday organised “tiranga yatras” in the twin capitals of J&K to commemorate the Accession Day, when then Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession with India in 1947, as the day was also declared a holiday first time since the region was designated as a Union Territory (UT) last year.

A “tiranga yatra” was organised in Srinagar, where the BJP activists hoisted the tricolour on a cavalcade of cars and marched from Tagore Hall to the Boulevard around the Dal lake.

“The purpose of the ‘tiranga yatra’ is to send a message to those parties, especially [Peoples Democratic Party president] Mehbooba Mufti, who don’t accept the tricolour. These parties have been acting like a virus for the last 70 years and we will not allow their spread any more,” BJP leader Ali Muhammad Mir said.

BJP leaders Sofi Yousuf and Altaf Thakur, who raised pro-India slogans, demanded action against Ms. Mufti for her remarks that “she will not unfurl the tricolour till J&K’s flag was returned”.

Three BJP leaders were detained in Srinagar on Monday when they marched to unfurl the tricolour.

A police official said the three leaders from the Kupwara unit arrived at the commercial hub Lal Chowk on Monday morning and were detained and shifted to the Kothi Bagh police station.

“These activists were heading towards a busy centre and could have caused interruption in traffic. They were also violating the standard operating procedures (SOPs) laid down for the COVID-19 pandemic,” a police official said.

The detained included BJP spokesman from Kupwara Mir Basharat, Mir Ishfaq and Akhtar Khan.

“We wanted to hoist the tricolour to send a message to the members of the Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) that only the national flag will remain in Kashmir,” Mr. Basharat said.

A “tiranga yatra” was also carried out in the winter capital of Jammu by the youth wing of the BJP. Scores of two-wheelers and four-wheelers were decorated with the flags.

Three Jammu-based PDP leaders quit the party “in protest against the recent remarks of Ms. Mufti”. “Some of the actions and utterances are unforgivable.

186,2020/10/26,Gujarat High Court quashes poll code violation complaint against Minister,"Pradipsinh Jadeja was alleged to have distributed pamphlets during 2007 Assembly polls when model code of conduct was in place.

The Gujarat High Court on Monday quashed and set aside a criminal complaint against State Home Minister Pradipsinh Jadeja for alleged violation of the model code of conduct during the 2007 Assembly polls when he was the BJP candidate from Asarwa seat in Ahmedabad.

Justice Ilesh J Vora allowed Mr. Jadeja’s petition seeking quashing of the criminal complaint against him for offences under the Representation of the People (RP) Act and additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate’s order in December last year issuing summons to him to face trial in the case.

The metropolitan court, on the basis of a report of the investigating officer concerned and statements of two witnesses, had ordered that a criminal case be registered against Mr. Jadeja for alleged violation of the model code of conduct by distributing pamphlets.

It had also issued summons to Mr. Jadeja to face trial in the case.

The High Court in its order on Monday said, “The impugned order dated December 21, 2019 summoning the applicant and directing to register the complaint for offences under Sections 127A(1), 127A(2)(a), punishable under Section 127A(4) of the Act and proceedings of the criminal case of 2019 are hereby quashed and set aside.”

The High Court observed that “prima facie no offence is disclosed against the applicant” on the basis of the inquiry report and statements of the two witnesses.

The pamphlet, on the basis of which the offence was registered, is not an “election pamphlet” as per definition under the RP Act, it said.

“In light of the provisions of law as well as facts of the complaint and in support of material evidence, this court is of the view that the trial court failed to consider the facts and applicable law in its proper perspective and without any basis initiated judicial process mechanically against the applicant,” the High Court said.

It said that continuation of proceedings against Mr. Jadeja to face trial for the aforesaid offences would be “nothing but abuse of the process of law and harassment“.

A private complaint, filed by one Prakash Makwana in his capacity as the then Election Officer in the 2007 Assembly polls, alleged that Mr. Jadeja was involved in circulation of pamphlets carrying slogans ‘Aapnu Gujarat’ (our Gujarat) and ’Aagvu Gujarat’ (leading Gujarat).

The pamphlets also had the BJP’s party symbol lotus along with a photograph of Goddess Ambey with a prayer under the petitioner’s name, the complaint said.

The pamphlets were circulated when the model code of conduct was in force, after the Election Commission on October 10, 2007 declared December 11 and 16 as dates for the Gujarat Assembly polls, Mr. Makwana alleged in his complaint.

Based on Makwana’s complaint, the District Collector through a letter dated October 25, 2007, filed a written complaint against the petitioner (Mr. Jadeja), publisher and printer of the pamphlets.

Upon verification of the complaint, the metropolitan court directed Meghaninagar Police Station in Ahmedabad to investigate it under section 202(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Mr. Jadeja then moved the High Court seeking to quash the complaint and also stay the summons issued by the lower court while initiating the criminal case against him.

The High Court stayed the summons against him in an order in February this year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/e5kxjv/article32244477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GujaratHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gujarat-high-court-quashes-poll-code-violation-complaint-against-minister/article32944189.ece

188,2020/10/26,"Kamal Nath, Digvijaya ‘biggest gaddars’; BJP will win majority of seats in bypolls: Scindia","He also expressed confidence that the BJP will “win a majority”, if not all, of the 28 assembly seats where bypolls will be held on November 3

Accusing former Chief Ministers Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh of being the “biggest traitors” in Madhya Pradesh, BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia on Monday said they betrayed voters’ trust by running a “corrupt” government and he had to leave the Congress after people’s issues raised by him were not addressed despite approaching “every port of call”.

He also expressed confidence that the BJP will “win a majority”, if not all, of the 28 assembly seats where bypolls will be held on November 3.

In an interview with PTI, Mr. Scindia said 27 out of the 28 assembly seats which are going to polls were Congress seats, so the BJP has everything to gain, while the Congress has everything to lose.

By-elections were necessitated after 22 rebel Congress MLAs, loyal to Mr. Scindia, resigned from the party in March this year leading to fall of the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh. Later, three more MLAs resigned and joined BJP, while further three seats fell vacant due to the death of sitting MLAs.

“The Congress needs to win 28 out of 28 seats to be able to even think of coming close to forming the government and they have just lost another MLA (in Rahul Lodhi) who has joined the BJP. It is very clear that people do not have any hope in the Congress party, not only at grassroots, but also in sitting MLAs of the Congress,” Mr. Scindia said.

“I do not think in any other state you would have seen MLAs in such a large number — almost about 30% — leaving. It very clearly shows the lack of trust and faith in the state leadership of the Congress party which is Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh, and who are in a partnership,” the Rajya Sabha MP said.

Asked about the Congress campaign narrative of betrayal and being called ‘gaddar’ by Congress leaders during canvassing, Mr. Scindia said it is not a term that he normally uses in politics as he believes that there must be a certain level in politics that should be adhered to.

“If they indeed are using that term then the biggest gaddars (traitors) in Madhya Pradesh are Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh who have been ‘gaddars’ towards seven and a half crore people because none of the poll promises were fulfilled, they were busy in rent-seeking activities and holding on to power and chair rather than serving the people of the state,” Mr. Scindia said.

Talking about Kamal Nath’s ‘item’ jibe at BJP candidate Imarti Devi, the 49-year-old leader said public figures must adhere to certain values and morals and set an example.

Mr. Scindia said the remark was directed at a woman who has risen from the grassroots-level, fought a sarpanch election, became MLA three times and was a Cabinet minister in the Kamal Nath government.

“Kamal Nath says he cannot remember her name, which shows his arrogance of power that he cannot remember the name of a colleague who was part of his cabinet. After all, he was only the Chief Minister, who is the first among equals, and she was a colleague,” Mr. Scindia said.

To top that, he calls a woman and that too a Dalit woman “an item”, which speaks of his mentality towards both women and Dalits, he said.

“What is very sad is that he has not been alone in this. He has been followed very arduously by the former leader of the opposition Ajay Singh who in a statement said ‘Imarti should be made into a ‘Jalebi’ after the election’,” he said.

Mr. Scindia also alleged that former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh had also also made a derogatory comment about Meenakshi Natrajan two-three years ago

“This shows the attitude of the Congress party towards women and scheduled castes. If Baba Saheb Ambedkar was alive today, he would be very deeply grieved and pained,” Mr. Scindia said.

Kamal Nath has maintained he did not say anything disrespectful.

Asked if like Arjuna of Mahabharata, he feels any dilemma in taking on people with whom he was close to and fought together, Mr. Scindia said he is fighting for the cause of the people of Madhya Pradesh and for their well being.

Mr. Scindia said his father Madhavrao Scindia, grandmother Vijaya Raje Scindia and he joined politics only for the welfare of the people.

“For me, a political party is a medium to be able to reach that goal of public service. So for me, politics is not important, what is important is the goal of public service,” he said.

Mr. Scindia said he is willing to do whatever it requires to fulfil the aspirations of people, and if it “entails sometimes fighting with those with whom you have worked for over 20 years, so be it”.

“I tried to change the way the (Kamal Nath) government was functioning for 15 months, I went to every single port of call that one can to try and address these issues, but when they lay unaddressed, what option was I left with,” the former Union minister said.

Mr. Scindia said when the Congress came to power, aspirations of citizens of the state rested squarely on the shoulders of Kamal Nath, but he ran a “corruption-riddled government during the span of 15 months”.

Accusing the Nath government of indulging in corruption in numerous areas from “sand mining to liquor mafia”, Mr. Scindia said the Congress dispensation “literally ridiculed and belittled” the aspirations of the people.

“Not fulfilling any of the election promises left me no options but to look for a better governance mechanism for the people of the state. I firmly believe that the Shivraj Singh government would be able to provide that to the people under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president J.P. Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vddieq/article31151949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SCINDIAKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kamal-nath-digvijaya-biggest-gaddars-bjp-will-win-majority-of-seats-in-bypolls-scindia/article32944015.ece
189,2020/10/26,“Miya Museum” proposal stirs debate in Assam,"A committee comprising BJP legislators had approved the idea that Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma rejected.

Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma rejected a Congress MLA’s idea of setting up a “Miya Museum” at the Srimanta Sankaradeva Kalakshetra, a centre in Guwahati showcasing the State’s cultural heritage.

The proposal from Sherman Ali Ahmed, who represents the Baghbar Assembly constituency, and the Minister’s reaction have stirred a debate in Assam.

But independent Rajya Sabha member Ajit Kumar Bhuyan pointed out that a 16-member panel, which included six MLAs of the BJP, had already approved such a proposal.

In a letter to the Director of Museums on October 18, Mr. Ahmed sought the establishment of a museum at the Kalakshetra reflecting the culture and heritage of the people living in the char-chaporis (river islands or sandbars).

He also referred to the recommendations of the Standing Committee on Art and Culture presented to the 126-member Assembly on March 24.

“As the people living in char areas are mostly referred to as Miya, I have proposed to the government to establish a museum that would highlight and reflect the culture and heritage of the Miya people,” he said.

Dr. Sarma was quick to trash the idea. Reacting to the Congress MLA, he said: “In my understanding, there is no separate identity and culture in the char areas of Assam as most of the people there had migrated from Bangladesh. In the Kalakshetra, which is the epitome of Assamese culture, we will not allow any distortion.”

The cultural centre is named after Sankaradeva, a 15th-16th century saint-reformer who had propagated Vaishnavism across present-day Assam and beyond.

Mr. Bhuyan countered the Health Minister by posting on social media the pages of the Standing Committee’s recommendations. The committee was headed by Asom Gana Parishad MLA Utpal Dutta and included six BJP legislators — Padma Hazarika, Manshing Rongpi, Utpal Borah, Ganesh Kumar Limbu, Binod Hazarika and Rupak Sarmah.

Apart from a museum on the “people of the Char-Chaporis”, the committee had recommended the establishment of a separate museum on the Gurkha community in Assam.

“The Char-Chapori museum was recommended by the committee whose majority members are from the BJP and its ruling coalition. Now, after passing a recommendation with support from majority members, the BJP is politicising the whole issue to garner political mileage,” Mr. Bhuyan said.

“Will the members of the committee disclose on what basis was a museum on Char-Chapori proposed in the Kalakshetra premises? Will the MLAs from the ruling coalition answer why they supported the recommendation in the first place?” he asked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/x62wdv/article32759147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BISWASARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/miya-museum-proposal-stirs-debate-in-assam/article32943993.ece
190,2020/10/26,"Graveyards and cremation grounds should be as per population, says BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj","The Uttar Pradesh MP has alleged that Hindus were facing “injustice” as Muslims had larger graveyards in villages.

The size of graveyards and cremation grounds available in a village should be as per the population of the communities living there, BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj has said.

Reminiscent of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's comments about ‘kabristan and shamshaan’ during the 2017 Uttar Pradesh Assembly poll campaign, Mr. Sakshi has alleged that Hindus were facing “injustice” as Muslims had larger graveyards in villages. The comments were made by the Unnao MP during a ‘nukkad sabha’ on Sunday while campaigning for the Bangermau Assembly by-poll.

“Anupat ke adhar pe qabristan aur shamshaan hona chaiye (Graveyards and cremation grounds should be as per the population),” said the MP.

“Even if there is a single Muslim in the village, the qabristan is very large. But you (Hindus) cremate your dead in the farms or in the Ganga. Is this not gross injustice,” Mr. Sakshi asked.

A video of the speech by the controversial saffron-clad leader often accused of divisive comments was widely shared on social media. It is not clear in what context Mr. Sakshi made the comments.

Mr. Sakshi further said that the [Hindu] community's patience and decency should not be tested.

While campaigning for the UP Assembly polls in 2017, Mr. Modi had suggested discrimination under the then ruling Samajwadi Party and said that if a graveyard was made in a village, it should also have a cremation ground.

191,2020/10/26,Supreme Court stays Madhya Pradesh High Court order directing ‘virtual’ campaigns for bypolls,"Court refuses to “say anything on the merits of the case”, asks EC to consider the issues raised in the petitions.

The Supreme Court on Monday stayed a Madhya Pradesh High Court order which directed ""virtual"" election campaigning and rallies for the by-polls to 28 Assembly seats in the State.

Serving a fillip to ""physical"" poll campaigns and rallies amid the pandemic, a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar prima facie agreed with the petitions filed by the Election Commission and BJP candidate Pradyuman Singh Tomar, represented by advocate Astha Sharma against the High Court order of October 20.

The Supreme Court asked the Election Commission to consider the issues raised in the petitions and the High Court order of October 20 and ""proceed in the matter in accordance with law"". The court refused to ""say anything on the merits"" of the case.

Mr. Tomar argued that the order ""violated his right to conduct election campaigns through physical gatherings as permitted by the Election Commission, Central Government and the State of Madhya Pradesh"".

The Election Commission had on September 29 had issued a Press note announcing by-elections to the Legislative Assemblies of several States, including Madhya Pradesh. The EC had permitted public gatherings, election rallies subject to the COVID-19 guidelines.

The Centre had also permitted political gatherings beyond the existing limit of 100 persons under the National Disaster Management Act.

However, the High Court countermanded the EC by allowing campaigns and rallies only by virtual mode not by physical gathering.

The High Court made a condition that physical gathering is permissible only if the local District Magistrate is convinced that virtual mode is not possible. But even then, physical gatherings would be allowed only after the political parties deposit with the District Magistrate money sufficient to buy ""double the number of masks and sanitisers required for protecting the number of persons expected in the gathering"".",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6yjh4z/article32883893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/supreme-court-stays-mp-high-court-order-directing-virtual-campaigns-for-bypolls/article32942271.ece

Former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has been in “high spirits” 60 days after he was discharged from the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on October 25.

Mr. Gogoi had been admitted to the intensive care unit of the GMCH on September 24 following a drop in his oxygen saturation level. Doctors had attributed his condition to post-COVID-19 complications.

The 85-year-old veteran Congress leader was admitted to the GMCH on August 26 after testing positive for COVID-19.

“We cannot say he is fully recovered, but he is in high spirits. We cannot thank the doctors, medical staff and the Health Minister enough for ensuring quality treatment,” Congress spokesperson Rhituparna Konwar said.

Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said Mr. Gogoi would continue to be under medical surveillance.

“His further treatment shall continue in his official residence under the supervision of the doctors from medical college,” the Minister said.

The GMCH authorities had during the course of Mr. Gogoi’s treatment consulted doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi.

194,2020/10/26,"Bulandshahr by-poll | AIMIM, ASP trade charges","Both lodge complaints about attacks during campaigning.

The Bulandshahr Police on Sunday lodged FIRs under section 307 (attempt to murder) on Monday after the Azad Samaj Party (ASP) and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) accused each other of attacks on their party chief and party candidate respectively during campaigning for the Bulandshahr Sadar bypoll.

Police sources said while the AIMIM candidate Dilshad Ahmed had named the ASP in the complaint, the latter had blamed unidentified persons for the attack.

The incident gained traction late after ASP chief Chandrashekhar Azad tweeted that his convoy had been fired upon by unidentified men in Bulandshahr when he was campaigning in the old city area. He said their rivals had committed the cowardly act worried by the rise of the party.

Madan Pal Gautam, the district president of ASP, who had lodged the complaint, said the incident occurred when Mr. Azad was campaigning for the candidate Haji Yamin near the Maniharan Chowk area of the old city.

'Worried rivals'

“I was part of the convoy and heard 5-6 gunshots. We don’t know what party the assailants belonged to. It is for the police to investigate. Our rivals are worried about increasing voter base of the party. They want to silence us but we will continue our struggle for the deprived,” he said.

However, Dilshad Ahmed, the AIMIM candidate for the seat, said he was holding a meeting in the area when the members of the ASP attacked his party workers and fired in the air. “My clothes were torn off and chairs were thrown at us. I had to run to save my life. The brother of the ASP candidate has a criminal record and he has brought his cronies to Bulandshahr. I appeal to the administration to provide me security,” he told reporters.

SSP, Bulandshahr Santosh Kumar Singh, however, said the skirmish was more incidental than deliberate.

“There was no firing from either side. We have videos of party workers from both sides where they deny that shots were fired. The locality is so congested that had there been firing, it would not have gone unnoticed,” said Mr. Singh. “It was a minor incident that happened because the ASP convoy reached the same lane where AIMIM candidate was holding a meeting. There was a wedding in the area as well. As the lane got blocked, the ASP workers started throwing chairs which led to a heated argument and pushing and shoving,” he explained.

Mr Singh claimed it was Mr Azaad’s tweet that created a buzz around the incident. “So, I urged both the parties to lodge complaints .”

195,2020/10/26,Officials fear animals being trapped inside floating bio-mass,"The high officials of the wildlife wing of the forest department, Manipur, wildlife enthusiasts and other activists are worried that several wild boars, kharsa and other animals from the Keibul Lamjao national park might have been trapped inside the 10 hectares of floating bio-mass locally known as phumdi that had drifted from the Loktak lake in Bishnupur district on Saturday night. Forest officials, local volunteers visited some of the lake in country canoes on Sunday.

The floating bio-mass had drifted following heavy rains in the past few weeks. As all rivers deposit the water to the Loktak, the largest fresh water lake in the Northeast the water level of the lake was increased. The Ningthouhong side of the lake where the phumdi is anchored now is near the national park.

Range officer, Sukham Ratan said, “ The floating bio-mass is a part of the national park which is the natural habitat of the brow-antlered deer, the rarest deer in the world. The population of this endangered deer in its natural habitat is less than 300. Since the water weeds are more than 10 ft high the combined team could not see any animals . However we are fairly certain that there must be a big number of wild boar and kharsa in this drifting phumdi”.

Rebecca Soibam, district forest officer who was among the combined team said, “We are inspecting the bio-mass by rowing in 6 country canoes. As we are certain that some wild animals must be in this phumdi we appeal to all sections of the people to extend all possible helps in rescuing these wild animals. We are hoping that this floating bio-mass will be drifted back again to the main portion of the lake. Because a strong wind had caused drifting of this mass towards the present position”.

She further said that the drifting portion of the floating bio-mass is within the areas where census of the wild animals is done in the national park several animals must be trapped there.

The Manipur government had deployed armed paramilitary personnel in the national park. Since the poachers of all, sorts are armed with guns and other deadly weapons the skeleton staff of the wildlife wing of the forest department could not make their presence felt. An employee said ,”With the help of the personnel we rounded up poachers. Besides some persons have been making a comfortable living by catching the migratory birds. However the personnel were withdrawn on the pretext that they are needed in the capital to maintain law and order. The poachers and bird catchers are back to the lucrative business.

Though it is customary to break ash gourd and coconuts after the puja, the vegetable pieces left on the roads pose threat to road users. The civic body had asked residents, traders and shopkeepers to refrain from the practice. However, smashed gourds and coconut pieces were left uncleared not only on arterial roads, but also on roads in residential areas.

Conservancy workers said that garbage, including banana steam, mango leaves and unsold items left by traders on the road, were minimum compared to last year. The quantity of items put up for sale by the traders was very less and hence less waste, they said. “After puja, we face a daunting task of removing the garbage. But this year, very few items were dumped on the road,” said a conservancy worker. He said that the bins did not overflow and all the accumulated garbage were removed on Monday.

203,2020/10/26,"Around 2,200 children enrol in anganwadis in Coimbatore","Around 2,200 children aged between two and five enrolled in anganwadi centres across Coimbatore district on Monday to mark Vijayadasami.

An official from the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) said the enrolment took place at 1,697 anganwadis in the district. Though it was expected that the enrolment in anganwadis would see a decline due to COVID-19, many parents came forward to enrol their children on Monday, the ICDS official said.

“We were thinking whether the parents would be willing to come to anganwadis for enrolment in this situation,” said S. Sobia, a teacher at an anganwadi at Dhamu Nagar in Puliakulam. Four anganwadis in the Dhamu Nagar area saw the enrolment of 20 children on Monday, she said.

205,2020/10/26,Migratory birds begin to arrive at Nanjarayan Tank,"With migratory birds from various parts of India and world arriving at the Nanjarayan Tank near Uthukuli in Tiruppur district, birdwatchers remain hopeful about an increase in the number of birds visiting this year.

A Forest Department official said on Monday that the birds started arriving in the first week of October and more birds were expected to arrive in the coming months. Whether the overall reduction in air pollution levels and other environment impacts of COVID-19 would affect the number of birds visiting this year were yet to be seen, the official said.

K. Ravindran, bird watcher and president of Nature Society of Tiruppur, said the initial stages seemed to be satisfactory without any apparent drop in the arrival of the migratory birds. “The Nanjarayan Tank is attracting shore birds,” he said, referring to the birds found on shorelines or shallow waters across the world such as sandpipers (common, wood and marsh), ruffs and Temminick’s stints.

Other migratory birds from Europe that arrived included garganeys and northern shovelers. Birds such as spot-billed pelicans, Indian cormorants, grey herons and painted storks were some of the birds that migrated to Nanjarayan Tank from other parts of India, Mr. Ravindran said. Most of the migratory birds would arrive by December and leave by the beginning of March.

The forest official said that Forest Department staff visited the Nanjarayan Tank every day to ensure no activities that might disturb the migratory birds took place. “The public have been quite supportive so far,” the official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/sm3fz2/article32947728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB27BIRDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/migratory-birds-begin-to-arrive-at-nanjarayan-tank/article32947729.ece
206,2020/10/26,More MSMEs seek services of facilitation council to get dues,"More number of Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs) are seeking the support of the facilitation council of the government to get payment arrears from larger industries.

B. Karthigaivasan, General Manager of District Industries Centre, said MSME facilitation council held four hearings for this region during the last six months and 12 cases had been settled with payments made to the tune of ₹ 88.57 lakh. Further, judgements were passed for 52 cases for ₹ 11 crore. As many as 225 cases were heard, including some cases that came up for second or third hearing.

Apart from this, 150 applications were pending.

Mr. Karthigaivasan said applications came to the council from across the region. After the lockdown, there were more applications. Most of these were from Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode, and Krishnagiri.

Usually, a large industry that gave job orders to vendors need to make the payment within the agreed period. Micro or small-scale enterprises approached the council when the pending amount was substantial or the large unit had severed business ties with the vendor. “There seems to be undue delays in payments now,” he said.

Mr. Karthigaivasan pointed out that the State government issued a communication recently pointing out that there were reports of inordinate delay in payment of dues to the MSMEs from government departments and organisations too. All departments and public sector undertakings were asked to make payments for goods and services from MSMEs within 45 days.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/more-msmes-seek-services-of-facilitation-council-to-get-dues/article32947701.ece
207,2020/10/26,Micro units plan to step up awareness on industrial safety,"Micro and small-scale units plan to step up awareness on industrial safety measures following the death of a 27-year-old micro unit owner on Sunday evening because of an electrical accident at his unit.

According to J. James, president of the Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, the unit owner had completed Navarathri pujas at the unit and had accidentally touched a live wire. There was a similar accident seven or eight years ago and the unit owner died in an electrical accident. The workers at micro units may not notice while cleaning the machinery wires that were unprotected. There was certainly a need to improve awareness among the micro and cottage units on electrical safety. “We plan to take up measures regarding this,” he said.

B. Karthigaivasan, General Manager of District Industries Centre, said micro units normally did not come under the focus of the government for industrial safety measures. The government had taken a lot of steps to encourage units to go in for energy audits. A similar campaign could be taken up among micro and small units on industrial safety, he said.

C. Sivakumar, president of Coimbatore and Tiruppur District Tiny and Micro Enterprises Assocaition, said 90 % of these units functioned out of rented buildings. Earthing and wiring were important and the unit owners may not be aware of how strong these two were in the buildings. Several accidents could be prevented with proper earthing. “We keep telling the units that they need to focus on these two,” he said.

Mr. James added that the Association would work with the DIC to create awareness among the units on electrical safety.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/micro-units-plan-to-step-up-awareness-on-industrial-safety/article32947688.ece

209,2020/10/26,Codissia’s defence innovation centre to be inaugurated,"The Codissia Defence Innovation and Atal Incubation Centre (CDIIC), an initiative of the Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (Codissia), will on October 28 sign Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) with 5 Base Repair Depot and Air Force and Naval Ship Repair Yard, Kochi, to indigenise defence sector components and products.

R. Ramamurthy, president of the Association, told The Hindu that for the last four years, Codissia was working with the Central Government to encourage involvement of MSMEs in defence sector indigenisation. This would be done through the CDIIC, to be inaugurated on October 28, that had come up in the Defence Corridor in the State.

The total project cost for the Centre was ₹ 45 crore. While the Defence Ministry would provide ₹ 20 crore, including ₹ 5 crore soft loan to product developers in need of financial support, the Atal Incubation Centre would give ₹ 10 crore as grant, at ₹ 2 crore each for five years. Codissia would invest ₹ 10 crore apart from providing land and machinery.

The building for the Centre, to come up at Codissia Industrial Park at Kallapalayam, was awaiting approval for building plan. Meanwhile, the Centre had already placed orders for machinery and the Centre’s operations would take off at the Codissia Trade Fair Complex.

Through the Atal Incubation Centre, CDIIC endeavoured to handhold a minimum of 10 Incubatees and ensure that at least five incubatees graduated every year from the second year. Many aspiring and existing entrepreneurs with ideas shall be mentored and guided towards succeeding in their projects, which would both be towards domestic as well as defence requirements.

With the signing of agreements, there would be regular interaction between the MSMEs and the defence PSUs regarding development of spares and components. Products to be developed at the Centre would be finalised soon, he added.

The event on October 28 would have a question and answer session for MSMEs to know more about opportunities in the defence sector.

Interested MSMEs can take part in the virtual launch by logging on to Twitter (@CDIIC1), Facebook (www.Facebook.com/CDIIC), Linkedin (www.linkedin.com/in/info-cdiic-a94b701a6) or Youtube (https://bit.ly/3kce4Er).",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/codissias-defence-innovation-centre-to-be-inaugurated/article32947678.ece

Unarvugal, a non-governmental organisation and Rotary Club of Erode Central began a door-to-door collection of books from the public here on Monday for children in Gundri Hills, which did not have a library.

Founder-president of Unarvugal Makkal G. Rajan said there were over 5,000 people living in hamlets in Gundri Hills where access to libraries was a key challenge to children. Children needed access to books outside of their syllabus in order to increase their knowledge. But there was no library in the hills and children could not access books, he said.

Mr. Rajan said used and new books, and dress materials, would be collected till November 6 and handed over to the children in the hills. He called upon the public to contribute to this effort, pointing out such a gesture could transform the life of the children in the hills.

Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan inaugurated the campaign by handing over books for the children. Later, Rotary and NGO members collected books from people in Periyar Nagar and Sampath Nagar.

214,2020/10/26,Indian Premier League 2020 | Rohit Sharma resumes training for Mumbai Indians,"Rohit Sharma has missed the Mumbai Indians’ last two IPL games owing to a left hamstring injury.

Minutes after he was excluded from India’s forthcoming tour of Australia on medical grounds, Rohit Sharma’s Indian Premier League franchise released pictures of India’s limited overs vice-captain resuming training after a weeklong break.

Rohit has missed the Mumbai Indians’ last two IPL games owing to a left hamstring injury. It was followed with the BCCI selection committee omitting him from Test, ODI and T20I squads for the tour to Australia that is to follow the IPL.

“The BCCI Medical Team will continue to monitor the progress of Rohit Sharma and Ishant Sharma,” stated a BCCI media release.

But two hours after the release was issued, Mumbai Indians posted pictures of Rohit padded up and walking out to bat during its training on Monday, ahead of Wednesday’s clash against Royal Challengers Bangalore. While it led to confusion over Rohit’s fitness, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar during a post-match show on Star India called for “transparency” over Rohit’s fitness.

While making his injury official, just before the start of the Mumbai Indians’ game against Chennai Super Kings on Friday, MI had also issued a similar statement. “Rohit Sharma has suffered left leg hamstring strain during Mumbai Indians’ last outing (vs Kings XI Punjab on October 18). Rohit has made good progress over last four days, while the management is taking one day at a time monitoring the recovery process in consultancy with BCCI,” MI had said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/7lg9dd/article32947845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RohitSharma,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-2020-rohit-sharma-resumes-training-for-mumbai-indians/article32947846.ece
215,2020/10/26,Hanuma Vihari says there will be enough time to adapt to take on Australia,"Batsman excited about Test series down under

Hanuma Vihari says that there will be enough time to adapt and get back into the desired mode, as the team will play a couple of practice games too, to take on Australia in the forthcoming tour down under.

“Personally it is all about mindset. I just want to be mentally and physically fresh in the run-up to the first Test. I will use all the available opportunities, including the warm-up games, to get into the right frame of mind for the major challenges ahead,” the 27-year-old Vihari told The Hindu recently.

“Definitely it is not the kind of 100 per cent preparation I should have had before the tour because match practice is something totally different,” he said referring to the fact that his last First-Class game was the Test in New Zealand this March before the pandemic broke out.

“We have to work more on fitness and fielding once we land there,” he said.

“It certainly takes time for anyone to get back to competitive cricket after such a long break. It is fine with batting and bowling which I have not missed in the last seven months thanks to the makeshift nets at my place of residence,” Vihari said. “Fortunately, I worked with our Indian team fielding coach Sri sir (R. Sridhar also from Hyderabad) a lot on catching and fielding,” he said.

Vihari said this Australia series would be different as some of the big names are back and in form too.

“But our captain (Virat Kohli) and the coach (Ravi Shastri) always ensure that we have a positive approach to any task on hand,” he said. “Their attack is similar to what we played last time. Of course, we have to expect tough battles,” he added.

Pink ball Test

The soft-spoken Vihari is also excited at the prospect of playing a pink ball Test. “It will be great to play in that pink ball Test at Adelaide. My earlier playing experience is only in the Duleep Trophy match,” he said.

On his targets, Vihari says he wants to be a key performer in the Indian team which is aiming to clinch the prestigious ICC world Test championship.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/9yl75a/article32947205.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27-VIHARI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/hanuma-vihari-says-there-will-be-enough-time-to-adapt-to-take-on-australia/article32947206.ece
216,2020/10/26,"India’s tour of Australia: Rohit Sharma misses out due to injury, Rahul and Siraj selected for Tests","Mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy the new face in T20 squad

Rohit Sharma, who has missed the last two Mumbai Indians games in the Indian Premier League after sustaining an injury, has been omitted from the squads for India’s tour of Australia.

The BCCI on Monday announced the squads picked by the senior national selection panel, headed by Sunil Joshi, for three ODIs, three T20Is and four Tests to be played from November 27 to January 19.

“The BCCI Medical Team will continue to monitor the progress of Rohit Sharma and Ishant Sharma,” stated a BCCI media release. Ishant, the pace spearhead, returned home from the IPL after getting injured.

While Rohit and Ishant have fitness concerns, wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant has been dropped from the limited-over squads. While K.L. Rahul, who has also been elevated as vice-captain for the ODIs in Rohit’s absence, is the sole ’keeper in the 50-over format, he has back-up in Sanju Samson, who has retained his place in the T20I squad.

Rahul also makes a return to the Test squad. In Ishant’s absence, Mohammed Siraj has been named as the fifth pacer for the Test series in a squad of 18.

Varun Chakravarthy in T20I squad

Varun Chakravarthy, the mystery spinner from Tamil Nadu, couldn’t have timed his maiden IPL five-wicket haul better, as he has earned a maiden call-up for the T20I squad. In fact, he is the only uncapped cricketer to have been selected across three squads.

In addition to the 28 players who will feature in the three squads combined, the selection committee has chosen pacers Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Kartik Tyagi, Ishan Porel and T. Natarajan to travel to Australia as back-up.

The squads are

T20I squad: Virat Kohli (Captain), Shikhar Dhawan, Mayank Agarwal, KL Rahul (vice-captain and wicket-keeper), Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Hardik Pandya, Sanju Samson (wicket-keeper), Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

217,2020/10/26,IPL 2020 | Revitalised Kings’ fifth win on the trot lifts them to fourth,"After bowlers restrict KKR to 149 for nine, Mandeep and Gayle power the chase; Gill-Morgan counterattack not enough.

When Mandeep Singh reached a well-deserved fifty, he raised his bat towards the sky. He was dedicating the knock to his father Hardev Singh, who passed away on Friday.

His measured 66 not out (56b, 8x4, 2x6) and Chris Gayle's swashbuckling 51 (29b, 2x4, 5x6) — the pair added 100 for the second wicket — guided Kings XI Punjab to a comfortable eight-wicket victory over Kolkata Knight Riders at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Monday.

A target of 150 for a formidable batting line-up on a ground with small boundaries was never going to be enough. KXIP romped home with seven balls to spare.

It was the fifth win in a row for K.L. Rahul's men. What a turnaround it has been for them; two weeks ago, they were placed right at the bottom.

They are playing so well now that not even the absence of Mayank Agarwal, the edition’s fifth-highest scorer with 398 runs, has affected them.

They have moved up to fourth on the table with 12 points, the same as KKR, which has an inferior net run-rate.

The win was set up by a spirited effort from the KXIP bowlers, who justified their captain's decision to field first. KKR was reduced to 10 for three in the second over.

Though Shubman Gill (57, 45b, 3x4, 4x6) and captain Eoin Morgan (40, 25b, 5x4, 2x6) rallied with an 81-run stand for the fourth wicket, another collapse, in the lower-middle order, meant the side could not end up with enough runs on the board for the bowlers to make a match of it.

Disastrous start

KKR had begun disastrously, with Nitish Rana, the hero in the last match, choosing to sweep the first ball he received. He ended up giving Gayle a comfortable catch at short fine-leg and bowler Glenn Maxwell a reason to smile.

The second over proved even more dramatic, as Mohammed Shami struck twice within the space of three balls.

Both Rahul Tripathi and Dinesh Kathik were forced to edge behind the stumps.

Although the latter reviewed the decision, it was in vain. This wasn't going to be KKR's night.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/79dfd7/article32947995.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHRISGAYLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kolkata-knight-riders-vs-kings-xi-punjab-indian-premier-league-2020-sharjah/article32945708.ece

It must be noted that Saini, who could be a part of India’s touring team to Australia, will also need the permission of BCCI’s medical team, which is a keeping a tab on all the international players.

In the 18th over, Saini was hit on the right thumb while fielding off his own bowling. He immediately left the field and got his webbing stitched up by a surgeon.

“Saini has split his webbing in the last ball there,” RCB team physio Evan Speechly told RCB TV after the match.

“He obviously got hit on the right thumb. Fortunately, we had a good hand surgeon, who stitched up nicely, put five stitches.

“So we will monitor him overnight and check whether he can ready for next match. I cannot be sure when he is good to go but hoping he will play next match.”

Speechly said he cannot say with certainty if Saini will be able to play against MI as the injury is on his bowling hand.

“It’s also because Saini’s injury is on his bowling hand, so it puts a lot of pressure on him.

“I cannot be sure when he will be good to go. I am hoping that he will be good to play in the next game and the rest of the tournament,” he said.

Kohli’s experience

Speechly said the injury is similar to what RCB skipper Virat Kohli suffered in the 2016 season.

“Virat four-five years ago had it in Kolkata. We managed to stop the bleeding and he smashed a 100 (113, against the Kings XI Punjab) after we got a plastic surgeon, who had stitched it. Unfortunately, you cannot compare the two injuries,” he said.

“Some people manage it and some can’t.”

Kohli had finished that season with 973 runs despite having nine stiches on his right hand.

Saini has been a key bowler for RCB, having taken five wickets conceding just 7.95 runs an over.

RCB, who finished runners-up in 2016, are currently placed in the third spot in IPL standing with 14 points, behind Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals.

He was installed in the newly created position of president of the Members Council - the country’s highest decision-making body made up of the 14 provincial affiliate presidents

Cricket South Africa’s 10-member Board of Directors has resigned, clearing the decks for an interim administrative structure in the crisis-ridden body as sought by the country’s olympic committee.

Six directors, including former acting president Beresford Williams, had stood down following a meeting on Sunday. The remaining four quit on Monday.

“After the Members’ Council had deliberated and resolved that in order to best serve the interest of cricket in South Africa, the entire Board should resign - which they did. All Independent and Non-Independent Directors have now resigned,” CSA said in a statement on Twitter on Monday.

“Following the Members’ Council meeting held yesterday, 25 October 2020, the Members’ Council received and accepted resignations from Board members.”

The development comes just days before the start of the domestic season on November 2. England’s men’s team also arrives next month to play three ODIs and three T20Is.

An interim steering committee is likely to be put in charge of CSA, as per the instruction of the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC).

For now, Rihan Richards is in control of cricket in South Africa. He was installed in the newly created position of president of the Members Council - the country’s highest decision-making body made up of the 14 provincial affiliate presidents - on Sunday.

The en masse resignation came after several calls in the past months from a range of stakeholders, including the South African Cricketers’ Association (SACA), for the Board of Directors to go.

As recently as last week, CSA had refused to disband, rejecting suggestions from the Members’ Council to comply with SASCOC.

As a result, SASCOC had referred the matter to the country’s sports minister Nathi Mthethwa, who had given CSA until Tuesday to provide him with reasons not to use the National Sports and Recreation Act to intervene.

Mthethwa had also issued a notice to the ICC that he would be wading in to CSA in a bid to reform the organisation.

Now, CSA may be able to avoid government interference by working with SASCOC and instituting a new administrative structure.

CSA has been plagued by allegations of racism, payment issues and malpractices in administration which has attracted the central government’s attention.

It had for long resisted making a report by independent investigators into its affairs public. It later released a summary of the findings, more than two months after it received the report.

CSA was also forced to hand over the full report, nearly 500 pages long, to a committee of South African lawmakers after they demanded to see it.

220,2020/10/26,IPL 2020 | Delhi Capitals eyes playoff berth in clash against SRH,"Shreyas Iyer's team has had two back-to-back defeats.

Delhi Capitals would look to complete the unfinished business and seal their place in the playoffs when they take on Sunrisers Hyderabad in a crucial Indian Premier League match in Dubai on Tuesday.

Two back-to-back defeats against Kolkata Knight Riders and Kings XI Punjab must be hurting but Delhi Capitals needs to shrug it off and add two points to take their tally to 16, which will elevate them to the top of the table.

On the other hand, Sunrisers’ hopes to reach the playoffs are hanging by a thread. David Warner and his men occupy the penultimate spot with eight points from 11 outings.

To reach the qualifiers they must win their remaining three games and hope all other results go their way.

The Capitals possess an explosive batting department as well as a formidable bowling unit. They have not been dependent on any one person, as different players have raised their hands at different points of time to deliver the goods for the team.

However, apart from Shikhar Dhawan, the Delhi batsmen have been very inconsistent in the last three games.

In the win against CSK, Dhawan, who scored a century, did the heavy lifting with the bat.

The senior opener again notched up a hundred against KXIP but with no substantial contributions from the other batsmen, Delhi lost the game.

Against KKR, the Delhi batsmen crumbled under pressure, managing to put up only 139 runs in 20 overs while chasing 194.

Opener Prithvi Shaw, who has been going through a lean patch, was replaced by Ajinkya Rahane but to no avail as the senior Indian player perished without opening his account.

Rishabh Pant and Shimron Hetmyer have also struggled since their return to the playing XI.

The South African pace duo of Kagiso Rabada (23 wickets) and Anrich Nortje (14) has been exceptional. Tushar Deshpande and Ravichandran Ashwin’s performance has been erratic in recent matches, while Axar Patel has done well to suffocate the opposition teams.

Sunrisers heads into the clash after a demoralising loss. Chasing a modest 127 against KXIP, the complexion of the match changed following the dismissal of openers Warner and Jonny Bairstow in quick succession.

The former champions lost five wickets in the final two overs to suffer a humiliating defeat.

The team heavily relies on its batting unit, mainly on Bairstow, Warner and Manish Pandey. Vijay Shankar did well in the win against Rajasthan Royals but couldn’t replicate his performance against KXIP.

The bowling unit strengthened by the inclusion of Jason Holder was outstanding in the previous game and skipper Warner will desperately hope they put up a similar display against Delhi.

The Orange Army will also take confidence from the fact that they defeated Delhi earlier in the tournament.

Delhi Capitals: Shreyas Iyer (c), Kagiso Rabada, Marcus Stoinis, Sandeep Lamichhane, Ishant Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin, Shikhar Dhawan, Shimron Hetmyer, Alex Carey, Mohit Sharma, Prithvi Shaw, Lalit Yadav, Avesh Khan, Axar Patel, Tushar Deshpande, Rishabh Pant, Harshal Patel, Keemo Paul, Amit Mishra, Anrich Nortje, Daniel Sams.

221,2020/10/26,CSK becomes first team to be eliminated from IPL 2020,"The Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side had made it to the play-offs in each of the 10 IPL seasons that it participated in since the league started in 2008.

Three-time champions Chennai Super Kings have been knocked out of the race of securing an IPL play-offs berth for the first time in 13 years after Rajasthan Royals defeated Mumbai Indians by eight wickets in Abu Dhabi.

The Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side had made it to the play-offs in each of the 10 IPL seasons that it participated in since the league started in 2008.

However, CSK endured an inconsistent run in this IPL.

Dhoni’s men on Sunday notched up an eight-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bangalore to keep their slim chances alive for a few hours but all hopes ended when RR beat MI later in the day.

The win over RCB took CSK to 8 points from 12 matches but they can only achieve a maximum of 12 points if they win their last two games, which won’t be enough to seal a place in the play-offs.

In the points table, Mumbai Indians, Delhi Capitals and RCB are already on 14 points with Kolkata Knight Riders at 12 with three games to go, followed by Kings XI Punjab and RR — both on 10 points each with three and two matches left.

“We don’t really have a chance to make it to the play-offs, leave the mathematical part of it,” Dhoni had said after CSK beat RCB on Sunday.

“You have to enjoy the game no matter where you are on the table. If you are not enjoying the cricket, it can become cruel and painful. So I am glad with how the youngsters have responded.”

CSK had won back-to-back titles in 2010 and 2011, before reclaiming the crown in 2018 following a two year gap.

222,2020/10/26,IPL 2020 | Hope this hundred gives family some happiness in difficult time: Stokes,"Things are a bit tough back at home, says Rajasthan Royals’ star allrounder referring to his father’s battle with brain cancer.

Rajasthan Royals’ star England all-rounder Ben Stokes is hoping that his swashbuckling return to form with a hundred would not just rejuvenate his side but also give some happiness to his family as it copes with his father Ged’s battle with brain cancer.

Rajasthan rode on a blistering 107 by Stokes and an equally aggressive 54 by Sanju Samson to overhaul a 196-run target set by defending champions Mumbai Indians with 10 balls to spare on Sunday. The duo forged an unbeaten 152-run stand for the second wicket.

“It’s a bit difficult at the moment, things are a bit tough back at home, hopefully, this will give them some happiness,” Stokes told official broadcaster Star Sports in the post-match presentation.

Stokes, who missed the early part of the tournament to be with his father in New Zealand, said he was relieved to finally come to the party after a sluggish start in the opening role.

“Sort of bittersweet to be honest - it took so long to get one for the team. I would have preferred to get this form two or three games before when we weren’t relying on other results to get us through to the qualifiers,” he said.

“Came into the game with a lot more confidence than the other games. Nice to spend some time out in the middle and finish the game off. The ball was coming on nicely - be it short or full.”

Rajasthan Royals skipper Steve Smith described the partnership between Stokes and Samson as “sensational” and said the eight-wicket win was just the kind of result they needed to get their IPL campaign back on track.

“Very pleased, that’s what we were crying for, two of our experienced players take the game deep and the way I think those two (Stokes and Samson) finished it off today and played was sensational, so very pleased,” Smith said.

“I thought that partnership with him (Stokes) and Sanju was sensational,” added the Australian.

Smith said that his team was lacking match-winning contributions from experienced players, which it finally got against Mumbai.

“I hope our batters from tonight take a bit of confidence and momentum into the next game.

“That is what we have lacked, our experienced players going on to make match-winning contributions and getting the team close to home or home, as they did tonight, so I thought the guys did a fantastic job and hopefully we can take that into the next two games,” he said.

Losing skipper Kieron Pollard conceded that Mumbai were unable to contain the destructive duo of Stokes and Samson.

“Sometimes in life you have to do that (say well played to the opposition). They batted fantastically well. But 195/5 at half-time, I thought Hardik brought us back into the game, but well played to Stokes and Samson,” said Pollard.

“We got a couple of early wickets but were not able to capitalise on that. When you play a game of cricket, someone has to win and someone has to lose and we ended on the losing side this time around,” added the West Indian.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/b3zm80/article32941540.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDSTOKES,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-hope-this-hundred-gives-family-some-happiness-in-difficult-time-stokes/article32941543.ece
223,2020/10/26,Hardik Pandya first player in IPL to take a knee supporting ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement,"Mumbai Indians all-rounder Hardik Pandya has become the first player in the ongoing Indian Premier League to take a knee in support of the ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement.

Pandya’s gesture came during the game against Rajasthan Royals here on Sunday.

The all-rounder smashed 60 run from just 21 balls. After reaching his half century in the 19th over, he went down on a knee with his right arm raised to show solidarity with the movement against racism.

West Indies all-rounder and Mumbai’s stand-in skipper Kieron Pollard responded by raising his right fist.

After the match Pandya even tweeted a picture of himself with the caption “#BlackLivesMatter“.

Last week, West Indies Test skipper Jason Holder, who plays for the Sunrisers Hyderbad, had expressed his disappointment over none of the IPL teams taking a knee in solidarity with the movement, which, he felt, went unnoticed in the league.

“To be honest, I haven’t had one conversation up here around it (BLM). Sometimes it seems it has gone unnoticed, which is a sad thing.

“I guess it’s for us to re-highlight the importance of it, for people to understand what is happening in the world,” Holder had said.

The “taking a knee” gesture started in the West Indies’ Test series in England this summer in protest against racism after African-American George Floyd was killed by an on-duty white police officer in Minneapolis.

Mumbai Indians all-rounder Hardik Pandya said their bowlers were left with “not much options” against the marauding duo of Ben Stokes and Sanju Samson, who executed their skills to perfection to guide Rajasthan Royals to an eight-wicket win here.

Courtesy Pandya’s (60 off 21 balls) blitzkrieg, Mumbai put up an imposing 195 for five but Stokes and Samson made light work of the target, conjuring a match-winning unbroken 152-run second wicket stand to take Rajasthan home with 10 balls to spare.

“Sometimes you have to give credit to the opposition as well, and I feel that they really batted well. Our bowlers had not much to do; it was their skills and execution, which worked for them...they were better today in batting,” Pandya said at the post-match press conference.

The Baroda player, who smashed seven sixes and two fours, said they had enough runs on board and gave credit to Stokes and Samson for successfully chasing down the score.

“Hitting sixes is fun, which I enjoyed. I thought we got enough runs, initially when the second strategic time-out happened we were looking more at 165-170, and obviously we got 25 runs more, which I thought was enough but credit goes to Stokes and Sanju, they really batted well,” he said.

According to Pandya, luck was also on Rajasthan’s side. “They took their chances and I think even luck was there on their side ... actually multiple inside and outside edges went for boundaries. But having said that, they still played some outstanding shots, (about) which I don’t think our bowlers had much options (left) to do,” he said.

Despite the hammering, Mumbai sit at the top of the top of the table with 14 points.

“I feel from this game we should rectify our mistakes, and (fix) the other things we didn’t do and focus on the positives,” he said.

Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli on Sunday said that his team “wasn’t expressive enough” during the IPL match against Chennai Super Kings but accepted that in a marathon league, there would be a defeat “here and there“.

CSK beat RCB by eight wickets but Kohli’s men are well and truly on their way to the play-offs with 14 points from 11 games and need only one win to officially clinch a berth.

“140+ is a competitive total on that pitch, we were targeting 150. I thought we still could have bowled change of pace and the odd bouncer. We weren’t expressive enough. We let batsmen dictate stuff,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation.

Kohli said that CSK’s smooth run-chase wasn’t a true reflection of the tricky track that was on offer where his team could muster only 145 for 6.

“What you saw in the second innings wasn’t a true representation of how the pitch was. They bowled stump to stump. I don’t think we got a ball to drive when we batted. Their spinners kept it tight too.”

The Delhi High Court has refused to pass a blanket order on a plea by Unitech MD Sanjay Chandra, who is lodged in Tihar Jail for allegedly cheating home buyers, seeking to permit him to be produced physically before the meditation centre here to settle disputes.

Justice Vibhu Bakhru said the Court was of the view that no such blanket order can be passed in this regard.

The High Court, however, granted liberty to Mr. Chandra to apply to the concerned trial court specifying the particulars of the matters and the dates on which he requires to attend the mediation proceedings.

It said in a hearing on Friday that if any such application is made before the concerned court, it may be considered in accordance with law.

Mr. Chandra sought permission to be produced physically before the mediation centre at Patiala House Courts Complex here.

Advocate Vishal Gosain, representing Mr. Chandra, submitted that he was endeavouring to settle his disputes with various persons and mediation proceedings in this regard are underway.

He said the mediation proceedings were suspended for a brief period of time on account of the outbreak of COVID-19 but have since resumed.

Mr. Chandra is lodged in jail under judicial custody since August 2017 for allegedly siphoning off home buyers’ money.

The audit revealed that around ₹5,063 crore of home buyers’ money and around ₹763 crore of funds received from financial institutions were not utilised by the company and high value investments were made off-shore tax-haven countries between 2007-2010.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/82jpbr/article25522118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16UNI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-high-court-refuses-blanket-order-on-plea-by-unitech-md-to-allow-physical-presence-for-mediation/article32942903.ece
229,2020/10/26,"Senior doctors of NDMC hospitals go on mass leave, threaten indefinite strike","They demand release of pending salaries from the past three months.

Senior doctors of North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC)-run hospitals went on a day-long casual leave en masse on Monday as the crisis over pending salaries of medics of civic-run facilities deepened with no resolution in sight, officials said.

R R Gautam, president of the Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association (MCDA) on Monday said, “If our demands are not met, we will go on indefinite strike from tomorrow.”

The MCDA, an association of senior permanent doctors of the civic hospitals, was established in 1974 and has about 1,200 members. It also includes doctors from hospitals run by other two municipal corporations.

The MCDA on Saturday had issued a statement and threatened that its members from NDMC hospitals would go on a mass casual leave if their pending salaries of the last three months were not released.

The association already has given sufficient time to authorities concerned to resolve the issue and pay our salaries, “but they have not done anything to solve the problem, and instead they appear to be unconcerned with the plight of doctors,” it had said.

Recently, it had also issued a statement expressing solidarity with their agitating colleagues - resident doctors - of Hindu Rao Hospital and Kasturba Hospital, both under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), who are also protesting over their pending salaries.

The MCDA had recently threatened to go on an indefinite strike from October 19, but it had later decided to defer the strike in “public interest“.

The association, after holding an emergency General Body Meeting on Saturday, had “unanimously decided to protest against non-payment of our salaries for the past three months,” MCDA general secretary Maruti Sinha had said.

“The first decision taken in the General Body Meeting was mass casual leave by all senior doctors of the NDMC on Monday. And total strike for indefinite period of all senior doctors from Tuesday, if salaries of all doctors, including resident doctors are not released by Monday, and if a permanent solution like handing over MCD health services to the central government, is not decided,” the MCDA statement said.

The authorities are to be held “solely responsible for this unprecedented strike, as they are neither bothered about their doctors - so-called ‘Corona warriors’ - nor are they concerned about patients,” the statement said.

The crisis over the pending salaries has deepened as five of the resident doctors of the 900-bed Hindu Rao Hospital are sitting on a hunger strike since Friday with the Resident Doctors Association (RDA) saying the step was taken as no one is resolving the issue of their pending salaries.

Resident doctors of Hindu Rao Hospital on Sunday took their protest to the streets as they demonstrated at Connaught Place and later burnt an effigy of Ravana on the premises of the facility to draw attention to their plight.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/yfqq0y/article32943111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THHINDURAOHOSPITALRESIDENTDOCTORSSTRIKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/senior-doctors-of-ndmc-hospitals-go-on-mass-leave-threaten-indefinite-strike/article32942826.ece
230,2020/10/26,Coal scam: Ex-Minister Dilip Ray awarded 3-year jail term,"He was Minister of State (coal) in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.

A special court on Monday sentenced former Union Minister Dilip Ray and three other individual convicts to three years of jail term for irregularities in the allocation of the Brahmadiha coal block in Jharkhand in 1999.

The four convicts were fined ₹10 lakh each, while Castron Technologies Limited and Castron Mining Limited were asked to pay a fine of ₹60 lakh and ₹10 lakh respectively.

Ray, who was Minister of State for Coal in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, was later granted bail on furnishing a bond of ₹1 lakh.

Earlier this month, the court convicted him, along with then Additional Secretary Pradip Kumar Banerjee and then Adviser (Project) Nityanand Gautam, in the Coal Ministry.

Castron Technologies Limited, its director, Mahendra Kumar Agarwalla, and Castron Mining Limited were also convicted. The case pursued by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) alleged corruption in the allocation of 105.15 hectare of the abandoned coal mining area in Giridih in favour of Castron Technologies.

The CBI registered the case on January 7, 2014. It was alleged that Dhanbad-based Castron Technologies Limited, Castron Mining Limited of Kolkata and others conspired with public servants for allocation.

According to the agency, the beneficiary company was given an undue favour by violating the guidelines framed for the allotment of Brahmadiha coal block.

“Investigation also revealed that the company was to establish the end use plant for consuming the coal, but it did not establish the same. It was also alleged that the Brahmadiha coal block was not included in the list of captive coal mining at any point of time,” said the CBI. After investigation, the agency filed a chargesheet against the six accused. During the court proceedings, it examined around 51 prosecution witnesses through their affidavits.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/mctxnu/article32941735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DILIPRAYORISSATHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/coal-scam-ex-minister-dilip-ray-awarded-3-year-jail-term/article32941736.ece
231,2020/10/26,The jivatma in samsara,"Every jivatma through countless births is heir to the joy and sorrow in samsara, and thereby also compelled to come to grips with the challenges it poses. This means that either one gets used to the attractions of worldly life that are not easy to renounce, or chooses to get out of it by renouncing it in favour of salvation. Of course, all want salvation; but the effort to strive for it in earnest arises in a jivatma through the grace of God and the effects of one’s good samskaras.

The episode of Vibhishana seeking repose in Rama exemplifies this situation very clearly, pointed out Velukkudi Sri Krishnan in a discourse. Vibhishana is by nature a dharmatma and a devotee of the Lord. When he is spurned, humiliated and chased away by Ravana, he sees no option but to seek Rama who he knows is the Lord incarnate. So he leaves Lanka along with four well known attendants and reaches the other shore where Sugriva and the monkeys watch him poised above in the skies.

Fully aware of the sensitive nature of his coming from the enemy camp, he explains to the monkeys the purpose of his visit. He wishes to seek refuge in Rama. He has tried in vain to convince Ravana to hand over Sita to Rama. But Ravana, impelled by fate, has not heeded the good advice. He announces that he has abandoned Lanka, his possessions, sons, wife, etc. That is, he has renounced hold on whatever he thinks belongs to him and seeks Rama as the only support and succour.

Such a mindset that engenders a direct and personal relationship between the jivatma and God is crucial in the act of surrender. As one begins to reflect deeply on one’s inability to protect oneself; he also becomes aware of the untold benefits of reposing total faith in God, the ultimate protector.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/the-jivatma-in-samsara/article32947189.ece
232,2020/10/26,India much safer against tsunami threat: INCOIS director,"‘Communities need to be prepared better’

India is much safer against tsunami threat than it was in 2004, thanks to the state-of-the-art tsunami early warning system established at Indian National Centre for Ocean Information System (INCOIS) here. However, the best of warning systems could fail, if communities are not prepared, if they do not understand the official and natural warning signs of a tsunami, and if they do not take appropriate and timely response, warns Tummala Srinivasa Kumar, the new INCOIS Director.

""We have made impressive progress in building tsunami early warning capability. From absolutely no warning capability or for that matter any public knowledge of tsunamis in the Indian Ocean, we have reached a stage where we can detect large under sea earthquakes in real-time and provide a tsunami warning in 10 – 20 minutes after the earthquake occurrence. In fact, for Indian Ocean earthquakes where the network of seismometers is reasonably good, quakes can now be detected in less than five minutes and a tsunami warning issued within 10 minutes if the quake occurs elsewhere in the globe”, says the 48-year-old.

Dr. Kumar is among the first batch of scientists to join INCOIS when it started operating from National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) and was project manager of the Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre when it was established in 2007 after the 2004 Tsunami which caused havoc in Indian Ocean rim countries.

After a stint as head of Intergovernmental Coordination Group for Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System (ICG/IOTWMS) secretariat of Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO stationed at Perth, Australia, he has returned to take over as director.

He says the focus in recent times has been on enhancing community awareness and response through several capacity building activities, biennial Indian Ocean wide tsunami drills and piloting of the UNESCO-IOC Tsunami Ready initiative to provide a structured framework to build and measure capacities of coastal communities to respond effectively to tsunamis, through 11 important indicators.

Two villages -Venkatraipur in Ganjam district and Noliasahi in Jagatsingpur district in Odisha are now ‘Tsunami Ready’. “This has to be replicated in other vulnerable coastal communities as it also enhances ability to respond to cyclones and storm surges too,” says Dr. Kumar.

Tsunami early warning system in INCOIS has been continuously upgrading “observation network, forecast models, communication and computational systems”. In fact, “ we were among the first few centres to introduce quantitative tsunami forecasts. IOC-UNESCO accredited Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre as Tsunami Service Provider (TSP) for 28 Indian Ocean rim countries, along with Indonesia and Australia in 2011, for issuing regional warnings"", he points out.

“Tsunami warning is a race against time and for near-source regions like Andaman & Nicobar Islands, we have less than 10 minutes to issue warnings. To overcome such challenges we are establishing a network of 35 stations of which 31 GPS stations are ready. These help us estimate the tectonic plate’s movements in real-time and measure the vertical displacements under the sea directly,"" explains Dr Kumar.

INCOIS other major work has been on identifying the Potential Fishing Zones (PFZ) for the fishermen community. ""We are able to give species' specific information for Yellowfin Tuna and work is on developing advisories for species like Hilsa. Another improvement is overcoming the cloud cover through usage of geostationary satellites and numerical modelling. We have nearly 7 lakh fishermen’s mobile numbers to send advisories on whether it is safe to navigate into the sea,"" he says.

The institute under the Ministry of Earth Sciences has also partnered with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Airports Authority of India (AAI) to develop a satellite based message broadcasting services through the indigenous navigational satellite communication system 'NAVIC'. ""Seafarers, anywhere in the northern Indian Ocean, have access to these fisheries and safety information on their mobile phones,"" he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/mtmatn/article32947533.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26KRAINTERVIEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/india-much-safer-against-tsunami-threat-incois-director/article32947534.ece

238,2020/10/26,"Flood relief only partially distributed, claim residents","People who have not experienced inundation reportedly offered more than the allotted amount

Several instances of discrepancies have come to fore with regard to the distribution of financial relief to the victims of recent flooding in the city, especially in the Old Malakpet area flooded by the Musi River.

Quite a few families have claimed that they had received only ₹ 5,000 in place of the ₹10,000 announced by the government, while people who have not experienced inundation too were reportedly offered more than the allotted amount. “I stay in the same house with my four brothers and their families. Officials arrived and offered ₹ 50,000, calculated at ₹10,000 per family. And come to think of it, my house was not even affected during the floods,” said Syed Bilal, a social activist who stays in the Shankar Nagar basti. He claims that the distribution in Old Malakpet is ridden with politics and those whoever questioned the same are being threatened.

“As per our survey, only 178 homes were affected in Shankar Nagar, and as per the MRO’s survey, the number was 200. But here, the undeserving too are being paid full compensation, while those who have been hit very badly by the flood are denied the same,” he complains. Mohammed Ayoob Qureshi, another resident of Shankar Nagar has lost all his belongings to the flood, yet received only ₹ 2,500 as his share. “Water entered waist deep, and our fridge and washing machine have conked out. We had to throw away even our clothes as they were full of sludge, and unusable. Staying away with relatives for a couple of days, later we found shelter in a mosque,” Mr. Qureshi related.

Officials who visited the home, however, gave ₹10,000 in total for the four families living in different portions of the same building, he said. Akbar Qureshi, resident of Padma Nagar, said he got only ₹5,000 in compensation for the loss suffered, but entries were made in the records that he had received ₹10,000. “They said, by grace of God I was getting even that amount, and I should be grateful for that. I lost my ration, mattresses, clothes, television, set-top box, and several valuables. Neighbours helped by giving shelter in their home, or else my wife and I would have perished,” he said.

Bibi Reshma, another resident of Padma Nagar said her family, one among the two tenants in the building, got ₹5,000, within which to recompense her loss of cooler, refrigerator and washing machine. Women were seen on a video clip, vouching that they had received only ₹5,000. Residents under the condition of anonymity also complained that they were asked to produce ration card too in addition to Aadhaar for disbursement of relief.

Officials from GHMC, however, denied all the allegations and said details along with photos were uploaded on to the app, which functioned on the basis of the house numbers. However, relief was distributed to all houses in the affected localities, irrespective of whether a home was inundated or not, they said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/flood-relief-only-partially-distributed-claim-residents/article32947214.ece
239,2020/10/26,Missing boy’s body found in bushes,"Teen caught after ransom call confesses to murder

A five-year-old boy, who was missing for the past 10 days, was killed by a teenager and the former’s body was dumped near the Nehru Outer Ring Road, Shamirpet police said on Monday.

The 17-year-old migrant labourer from Odisha confessed to smothering young Adiyan to death after he accidentally fell on the ground and suffered head injury while shooting a video for ShareChat, social media platform. The teenager, who works at a dhaba, is a neighbour for the boy’s family at Shamirpet. “The teenager wanted to shoot a video of Adiyan kick jumping and post it on ShareChat. During the act, the boy, fell down and received an injury on his head. Fearing that Adiyan’s parents would rough him up, the juvenile killed him,” Balanagar DCP P.V. Padmaja told The Hindu.

She said that further he tied the boy’s hands and legs with an adhesive tape and stuffed the body in a luggage bag. “He walked till Shamirpet junction, from where he took a share autorickshaw till ORR and dumped the body in the bushes,” the officer said. Later, he met his friend, took ₹ 200 from him and went to Gajwel in search of work. However, he returned to Shamirpet as he could not find a job there.

Ms. Padmaja said that on the evening of October 15, Adiyan left home informing his mother that he was going out to play. When he did not return home, the boy’s parents searched for him in the locality and later lodged a missing complaint at Shamirpet police station.

Initially, as there were no clues of kidnapping or murder, the investigators assumed the boy might have been swept away in the floods and launched a manhunt in the nearby nalas and lake. However, on October 23, the owner of the building where the boy’s parents reside, received a call from an unknown number, demanding that ₹ 15 lakh ransom be paid to set Adiyan free.

“With the help of call details, we traced the teenager, who confessed to killing the boy as he fell off while shooting a video,” the DCP said. As he could not find a job and wanted to go back to Odisha, he demanded ransom, police said. “He thought of running away with the money and booked a train ticket for his return journey,” Ms. Padmaja said. Based on the juvenile’s confession, the police recovered Adiyan’s decomposed body and sent it to Osmania General Hospital morgue for autopsy.

The PGPMAX (Post-Graduate Programme in Management for Senior Executives) offered by the Indian School of Business (ISB) has been ranked as number one in India and 53rd globally in the Financial Times 2020 EMBA rankings released on Monday.

A release from ISB, announcing this, said the PGPMAX is a 15-month global executive MBA-level programme for senior executives and business owners with a minimum of 10 years of experience. The ranking reaffirms ISB’s leadership in management education, it said.

Dean Rajendra Srivastava said “the rankings not just highlight the relevance of the PGPMAX programme but also the importance of an Executive MBA for working professionals. It becomes more critical for the experienced executives to equip and brace themselves up to be ahead of the curve with the current circumstances. The need of the hour is to reinvent and gear up to meet uncertainties and looming challenges.”

According to the release, ISB Alumni from PGPMAX Class of 2017 were surveyed for this year’s ranking. This assessment has brought forth some other interesting findings such as PGPMAX being ranked 11th in the standalone programme category in Asia. The school is ranked 12th globally in terms of salary today (average alumni salaries three years after graduation). The salary increase is measured based on the average difference in alumni salary between their salary before the EMBA and now. The PGPMAX programme is ranked 28th globally for work experience of its students.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/isbs-programme-ranked-1st-in-india/article32947002.ece
241,2020/10/26,Social distancing missing at flower market,"The rush at the Gudimalkapur flower market was not surprising as flowers form a big part of Dasara celebrations in Telangana

It was business as usual at Gudimalkapur flower market on Monday morning as hundreds of farmers, traders and buyers descended to make their Dasara purchases. The COVID-19 lockdown appeared like a distant memory as the men and women jostled to bid, bargain and buy mostly marigolds, chrysanthemums and roses.

“I was afraid that business will be affected due to COVID-19 fears but over the last three days it was like old times,” said Jagannath Reddy, a wholesale flower trader, while adjusting his mask. While some traders wore masks and gloves, a majority of the shoppers could be seen without masks and social distancing norms were observed more in the breach. Hyderabad has seen closure of multiple wholesale markets including Osman Gunj, Begum Bazar and even Laad Bazaar due to COVID-19 super-spreader events.

The Durga Puja celebrations in the city have been low key events where the size of idols was limited to 2.5 ft, worshippers to 50 and the bhog (food) distribution among devotees was barred. The rush at the flower market was not surprising as flowers form a big part of Dasara celebrations in Telangana where they are used for the 9-day Bathukamma festival, as offerings for goddesses, and also for decorating vehicles and machinery for Ayudha Puja. “We sold the chrysanthemums for ₹ 300 per kg for two days and now the price has dipped to ₹ 140 as festival shopping is almost over,” said Venkatesh Reddy, who buys flowers in bulk and sells them in different parts of the city to retailers.

At the retail level, chrysanthemums were hawking for ₹ 20 for 50 gm (chatak) in the city as people made last-minute purchases before the puja.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/avn3t8/article32946836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY26FLAARS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/social-distancing-missing-at-flower-market/article32946837.ece
242,2020/10/26,"1,152 double-bedroom units launched in Hyderabad","Govt. building 2.5 lakh double-bedroom units across State with an outlay of ₹18,000 crore: KTR

Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao has, on Monday, launched a total of 1,152 double-bedroom dwelling units at three locations in the city.

Of these, 840 units were built at Jiyaguda, 192 at Ghode ki Kabr, and 120 at Kattelamandi, with a total outlay of ₹ 95.58 crore. At Jiyaguda, the structure is stilt plus five floors with a cost of ₹71.4 crore, with 568 units allotted for the slum dwellers who vacated for in situ construction of homes. At the remaining two locations, the structure is ground plus three floors. At Kattelamandi, the cost of construction is ₹ 9.3 crore, with 103 allotted for the in situ allotment, while at Ghode ki Kabr, the cost of construction is ₹14.88 crore, with 139 earmarked for in situ allotment.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Rama Rao said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is pitching in with financial assistance with regard to two most difficult life tasks of the common man, namely building a house and getting a daughter married. The government is building a total of 2.5 lakh double-bedroom units across the State with an outlay of ₹18,000 crore. Market value of these houses would be to the tune of ₹ 70,000 crore, Mr. Rama Rao said. Already 50 per cent of the houses have been completed.

Of the total, one lakh houses are being constructed for the urban poor within the city, with an expenditure of ₹ 9 lakh for each, he claimed, and said the market value of each house would be around ₹ 40 lakh. He questioned the veracity of the figures about construction of 40 lakh houses under the weaker sections’ housing programme since 1985, and wondered had it been true then why there were still poor families without homes. Existence of the double-bedroom dwellings built by the Telangana government, on the contrary, can be verified on the ground, he said.

The Minister has cautioned people against trusting any middlemen for allotment of the units, and said the selection of beneficiaries would be done by officials in a transparent manner. At Jiyaguda, beneficiaries in the housing colony have been urged to form a society and take care of the maintenance and sanitation of the colony with the rents obtained from the shopping complex built within the premises, comprising 56 shops. All the colonies will have Basti Dawakhana, Anganwadi centre, library, and all infrastructural facilities including roads, drinking water, and electricity on a par with gated communities, he said.

Five Nepalese, including a woman, have been arrested by the Rachakonda police for committing theft at a businessman’s house. They recovered stolen property worth ₹ 7 lakh from their possession.

The accused, who committed the theft on October 19 at the businessman’s house at HMT Colony of Nacharam, were arrested by the sleuths of Central Crime Station, Malkajgiri in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, between October 22 and October 25, and were brought to Hyderabad, said Rachakonda Commissioner of Police Mahesh M Bhagwat.

He said that two of the accused worked as servants at the victim’s house. “The complainant and his wife were not at home. The duo gave tea laced with sedatives to the former’s 70-year-old mother. After she lost consciousness, the duo made away with 18 tolas of gold jewellery, 40 tolas of silver ornaments and ₹ 10 lakh cash. When he returned home around 9 p.m. from his office, the complainant found his mother in an unconscious state. Then immediately he went to the first floor and found that that the bedroom door, cupboard and almirah lockers were broken and the servants were missing,” Mr. Bhagwat said.

The complainant strongly suspected his maid servant for the offence and for the attempt to kill his mother, he said. Based on his complainant, a case was registered and 15 teams, consisting of 45 officers from CCS, SOT, IT and law and order police, were pressed into service to nab the accused. Teams were sent to Mumbai, Pune, Jhansi, Lucknow along with railway stations, airport and to Nepal borders, including Rupadiah and Gourifanta checkposts.

244,2020/10/26,Instinct over sight: Why cooking vloggers kavithanagavlogs is seeing online success,"Nagalakshmi, a cook with visual impairment, and her sister-in-law Bondala Kavitha use their cheery vlog to remind us that the best kind of food is simple

“So what if I can’t see? Other people can and I can teach them to cook my specialities,” says Nellore-based Boddu Nagalakshmi, who along with her sister-in-law Bondala Kavitha launched Kavitha Naga Vlogs for food videos and friendly chatter in September.

What makes the videos of these 26-year-olds stand out is the simplicity with which they are presented. So much so, that this month-old vlog has pulled in 40,000 subscribers and gets between 1 lakh and 3 lakh views per video.

Nagalakshmi, who is blind in her left eye and has about 10% sight in the right, is a bundle of energy. She loves the camera and is always up for fun. She says, “I always wanted to be on YouTube but didn’t know how. My sister-in-law and I discussed it and decided to make home-cooking videos.”

Proud of her cooking skills, she says, with all honesty, that though she cooks everything well, her pappu charu and pacchadi are the best.

“I never used to cook when my mother was around. After she passed away, one of our tenants introduced me to the nuances of cooking. While I add salt and other ingredients with the judgement of my touch, I decided quantity of oil purely by practise.”

Kavitha says, “Till date, no one can say that Nagalakshmi has used excess oil in any dish. Her food is simple and very tasty.

She adds, “I love her range of pachchadis the most. There is no ingredient with which she has not made a pachchadi. The video where she made pachchadi with chukka kura (spinach dock/khatta palak) was viewed by a lot of people. Viewers tried the recipe and shared the results with me on Instagram handle @kavithareddybondala.” Kavitha continues, “Nagalakshmi also makes an amazing chutney with urad dal.”

It is obvious that they enjoy each other’s company as well as creating the vlog. They are excited about the channel’s earnings so far, though they are yet to withdraw the amount.

“When it increases some more, I want to buy something nice in gold for Nagalakshmi,” says Kavitha.

The two recently posted a video of Nellore chepala pulusu, with side notes on why the dish is famous. For this, they asked Kavitha’s sister for help, to find the most authentic recipe possible.

Nagalakshmi says, “Akka’s chepala pulusu is top class in Nellore.”

Through Kavitha Naga Vlogs, they want to show regional dishes, some forgotten and some yet to be discovered.

Says Nagalakshmi, “We want to shoot a video with Kavitha’s mother. She makes an excellent mutton dish that lasts many days without refrigeration. Kavitha is the chicken expert in the family and we love whatever chicken dish she makes.”

When asked how she learnt to face the camera and speak confidently, Nagalakshmi laughs, “TV. With whatever eyesight is left, I watch all the serials. I learn from there. I have studied till fifth class and can manage a little in English as well. And all that I have learnt from Telugu TV serials like Gruhalaksmi, Kasturi, Trinayani, Nagabhairavi .”

Kavitha adds that Nagalakshmi’s positive and cheerful demeanour is a big attraction. “She never indulges in self-pity. She is always looking to do something new and keeping us all engaged and happy.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/5wz6s6/article32944249.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Nagalakshmi-and-Kavitha,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-vlog-kavithanagavlogs-shows-regional-dishes/article32944251.ece
245,2020/10/26,Man held on murder charge,"The Palluruthy police arrested a person in the early morning hours of Monday on the charge of murder.

The arrested man was identified as Rajesh, 32, of Ambalapuzha in Alapuzha district. He is accused of murdering Sudharmani, 65, of Kuruvithara Road, Palluruthy, on Sunday around 7.30 p.m.

The police said that the two families had a row earlier in the day and later, when the victim had turned up to dump waste in a nearby drain, the accused, who was visiting his wife’s house, confronted her alleging that she was polluting the neighbourhood. A verbal spat erupted amidst which the accused shoved the victim, who collapsed to the ground and complained of chest pain.

She died while being rushed to the hospital. The accused had gone into hiding following the incident.

246,2020/10/26,Minor nabbed with 2.25 kg of ganja,"The excise department on Monday arrested a 17-year-old Plus Two student allegedly with 2.25 kg of ganja from near the Thripunithura railway station.

Originally from Kunnathunadu in Ernakulam, the teenager is now living in Tirur, Malappuram district. He allegedly confessed to the excise officials that he had bought the ganja for one Jinudev to whom he had allegedly sold 15 kg of ganja a month ago.

The teenager was tracked down following the statements of one Nithin of Kannankulangara, who was arrested with 500 grams of ganja last week. He used to supply ganja only against advance payment online, which the excise said, was a ploy to ensure that it was not a trap by the police or excise.

According to excise, the minor confessed to have been using drugs since the age of 13 before turning to sale a year later. Initially, he dealt in small quantities before switching to wholesale trade eyeing a luxurious life.

He used to purchase ganja for ₹10,000 a kg from Tamil Nadu and then trade it off for ₹50,000 mainly to drug dealers in Malappuram, Thrissur, and Ernakulam districts. He also used social media platforms for the purpose.

Excise officials said that the student started leading a solitary life after his parents were separated and married afresh. He reportedly confessed to have lived in a luxurious flat in Malappuram.

A team led by Thripunithura range excise Inspector Biju Varghese; preventive officer Kochumon; civil excise officers Sunilkumar, Naufal, Dhiru J. Arakkal, and Manoj, and woman civil excise officer Raseena.

Ganja found dumped

The Kunnathunadu police seized 11 kg of ganja filled in sacks, which were found abandoned in a rubber plantation near Pattimattom.

A tapping worker had found the suspicious package when he turned up for work in the early morning hours on Monday. He promptly alerted the plantation owner who in turn informed the police.

On opening one of the sacks at the station, the police found ganja in five tightly sealed packets covered with brown paper. Another abandoned packet containing 2 kg of ganja was found along the Pattimattom-Kizhakkambalam Road on Sunday night.

The police are trying to find out whether the two incidents were connected. The initial hunch is that the peddlers may have abandoned the drug on failing to change hands as planned owing to police patrolling in the night.

249,2020/10/26,Temples witness symbolics rituals for Vidyarambham against the backdrop of pandemic,"Most children enter the world of letters at home.

Against the backdrop of the spurt in COVID-19 cases, Vidyarambham functions were reduced to symbolic rituals in various temples in Thrissur on Monday. Most of the children entered the world of letters in simple functions at their homes.

In a symbolic ceremony at Thiruvullakkavu Sree Dharma Sastha Temple, Cherpu, which is famous for Vidyarambham ceremonies, only one child participated in the ritual. Acharya Sreedhara Warrier led the child to the world of learning.

Normally, the temple would witness huge crowds from early morning on Vijayadasami day. Around 10,000 children would usually attend the Vidyarambham rituals in the temple, which start as early as 4 a.m., and last till 7.30 p.m. in the evening, recalled the temple sources.

“However, maintaining the COVID-19 guidelines, we conducted ceremonies as a simple ritual. Special pujas, including Saraswathi Puja, were held. Around 500 people had dharshan at the temple by maintaining social distance. Devotees were allowed to enter the temple through West Nada and exit through east Nada,” the temple sources added.

250,2020/10/26,Coronavirus | Hopes rise for Oxford vaccine,"Work began on the Oxford vaccine in January.

The COVID-19 experimental vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly as well as young adults, British drug maker AstraZeneca Plc, which is helping manufacture the vaccine, said on Monday.

A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people worldwide, shuttered swathes of the global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people.

“It is encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults and that reactogenicity was lower in older adults, where the COVID-19 disease severity is higher,” an AstraZeneca spokesman said.

“The results further build the body of evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of AZD1222,” the spokesman said, referring to the technical name of the vaccine.

AstraZeneca did not provide details of the data behind the statement or say when it would publish eagerly awaited late-stage phase III trial data, which would show whether the vaccine works well enough in large scale trials for it to be approved.

The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech's candidate.

Also read: Coronavirus | Trials of a dozen vaccines progressing, says Gagandeep Kang

The news that older people get an immune response from the vaccine is positive because the immune system weakens with age and older people are those most at risk of dying from the virus.

British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said a vaccine was not yet ready but he was preparing logistics for a possible roll out mostly in the first half of 2021.

Asked if some people could receive a vaccine this year he told the BBC: “I don't rule that out but that is not my central expectation.”

Work began on the Oxford vaccine in January. Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the viral vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.

Immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants echo data released in July which showed the vaccine generated “robust immune responses” in a group of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55, the Financial Times reported earlier.

“We need to see the data before concluding that the responses were 'similar',” Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said.

He said that reactogenecity, which refers to common side-effects of vaccines like soreness and redness of the arm, was “often, but not always” associated with a vaccine’s immunogenicity.

“Studies carried out in the first stage of development of a vaccine will result in choosing a dose that does not cause too much reactogenicity,” he said.

AstraZeneca has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world as it gets closer to reporting early results of a late-stage clinical trial.

251,2020/10/26,Coronavirus | Third phase human trial of Covaxin to begin in Bhubaneswar soon,"Like the previous phases, half of the volunteers would receive placebo and the remaining half would be administered Covaxin.

The third phase of the human trial of the indigenous vaccine against COVID-19, Covaxin, will commence at a private hospital in Bhubaneswar soon, an official said.

The search for a suitable vaccine for COVID-19 has almost come to the final stage, Dr E Venkata Rao, Principal Investigator in the Covaxin human trial and Professor in the department of Community Medicine at the Institute of Medical Sciences and SUM Hospital, Bhubaneswar said on Sunday.

IMS and SUM Hospital is among the 21 medical institutes selected across the country by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) where the third phase trial would be conducted.

The indigenous vaccine, being developed by ICMR and Bharat Biotech has received the approval of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) for initiating the third phase trial. After completion of the first and second phase of the trial with demonstrable safety profile and immunogenicity, the large-scale efficacy trial involving thousands of volunteers has been planned now, Dr Rao said.

Dr Rao, who is the head of the Preventive and Therapeutic Clinical Trial Unit (PTCTU), said during this phase the age limit and eligibility/ screening criteria would be relaxed and several volunteers who are otherwise apparently healthy would be recruited for the trial.

Like the previous phases, half of the volunteers would receive placebo and the remaining half would be administered Covaxin in this phase. Even health care workers would be recruited for the trial. The volunteers would be followed up over a considerable period of time to look at the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing the development of the Coronavirus disease, he said.

Dr. Rao said there had been a huge response and enthusiasm among people who had offered themselves to be volunteers for the trial. He said persons above 18 years will be taken for the human trial.

The interested volunteers for the project could enrol themselves for the trial by registering online at www.ptctu.soa.ac under the section register for clinical trials, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/mzc2lk/article32187647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24-BINDU-AIIMGVH7K7EGP3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-third-phase-human-trial-of-covaxin-to-begin-in-bhubaneswar-soon/article32941715.ece
252,2020/10/26,"In Kolkata, empty pandals and roads mark Durga Puja","The city, by and large, abided by the Calcutta High Court order, which had declared pandals as no-entry zones for the general public

Durga Puja of 2020 turned out to be a ‘rossogolla’ without syrup for the people of Kolkata as restrictions and restraint dictated the festival.

Except a handful of places in south Kolkata, such as Ekdalia, where people still showed up in large numbers, pandals and roads across the city remained mostly deserted throughout the five days of Durga Puja. Those visiting friends and relatives could easily drive from one part of the city to another — something unthinkable in normal times.

It was obvious that the city, by and large, abided by the Calcutta High Court order, which had declared pandals as no-entry zones for the general public. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation, asking people to exercise caution, and repeated appeals by doctors, also appear to have worked.

“Calm and comfortable,” is how Sritama Chaudhuri, assistant professor of sociology at Asutosh College, described the mood in her neighbourhood. “I live in a housing complex, where they had the usual puja, but on the whole people were less puja-crazy this year. Everything was calmer. People enjoyed the real luxuries of life — food and rest,” said Ms. Chaudhuri, a resident of Paikpara in north Kolkata, which usually witnesses dizzying crowds.

The neighbourhood of actor Devtanu, who lives near Ruby Hospital, was also quieter than usual, and this prompted him to visit a few popular pujas in south Kolkata on the evening of ‘navami’, in the hope that they too would be deserted. At Ekdalia, however, he ran into a large crowd and he fled, but not before making a small video that showed hundreds gathered there.

“People wore masks, but of the designer variety, and made a mockery of social distancing. If people choose to behave irresponsibly, what can the government do? If people had behaved responsibly and if there was proper planning, the roadside hawkers who depend on outdoor festivals like Durga Puja for a living wouldn’t have been deprived of income this year,” Devtanu said.

CM tweets wishes

But on the whole, the celebrations remained muted. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee confined herself to extending her daily puja wishes to people on Twitter. A particular tweet by Governor Jagdeep Dhankar, however, did not go down well with many people: it showed him and his wife calling on the ailing Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, the former Chief Minister, on ‘ashtami’. The CPI(M) objected to the Governor sharing his pictures with the veteran leader when he was “most vulnerable” and asked him to take them down. Some others pointed out that the BJP itself never made public pictures of Atal Bihari Vajpayee when he was bedridden.

Throughout Durga Puja, Bengal’s most respected actor Soumitra Chatterjee remained in hospital, where he was admitted on October 6 after he showed symptoms of COVID-19. Even though the 85-year-old actor subsequently tested negative for the virus, his condition took a turn for the worse on ‘navami’ evening due to complications induced by the infection.

The impact of the celebrations — even if without the trademark flavour — on Kolkata, as far as the spread of COVID-19 is concerned, now remains to be seen. “From what we gather from media coverage and other sources, the crowd was definitely less than usual. But unfortunately, in several renowned pujas of the city and also in adjoining towns, one could see significant gatherings. The number of (COVID-19) cases is rising, but the real picture of the impact will be clear in about a week or so, provided there is appropriate testing and reporting of cases if transparent and real-time,” said Koushik Chaki, a founding member of the West Bengal Doctors’ Forum.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/g6ln8z/article32942931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN26EMPTYPOOJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/in-kolkata-empty-pandals-and-roads-mark-durga-puja/article32942889.ece
253,2020/10/26,"Coronavirus | Include disabilities in comorbidity survey, activists urge Kolkata Municipality Corporation","“We are dismayed that although the KMC survey includes columns on religion, caste etc, there is no column on disability in the survey form,” activists write in letter to KMC

In the last week of September, Bahni Bhattacharyya Mondal and her 24-year-old daughter with autism tested positive for COVID-19. When no help came from neighbors or the local civic authorities, the family residing in Dum Dum area in the northern fringes of Kolkata, approached the State Health Department which suggested that the mother and daughter would have to undergo treatment at different health facilities. The 61-year-old mother who has been caregiver to her daughter could not accept this proposition from the Health Department.

Finally, after a few more days of search and with the help of a doctor, the family managed to find at a private facility where they could admit themselves with their daughter.

“There is no protocol on how people with disabilities will be treated. People with disabilities like autism cannot be isolated and require more support in fighting with disease like COVID-19,” the mother said.

Several disability rights activists have written to Kolkata Municipal Corporation ( KMC) to include a column on disability in the comorbidity survey that the KMC has been conducting.

“We are dismayed that although the KMC survey includes columns on religion, caste etc, there is no column on disability in the survey form. Our practical experiences in the past months show that when persons with disabilities are getting infected, they need specific requirements,” a letter written by several disability rights organisations said. The letter addressed to the Chairman of the Board of Administrators of Kolkata Municipal Corporation, Firhad Hakim, suggested a “column on disability in your further surveys including on co-morbidities”.

Shampa Sengupta, who runs an organization, Sruti Rights Disability Centre, said that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has pointed out persons with disabilities as one of the most vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We are not trying to say that disability is related to comorbidity. But what we are trying to emphasize is that data on disability at ward level will help the policy-makers in being better prepared to deal with natural and health emergencies like COVID-19,” Ms. Sengupta said.

In the letter the activists have highlighted examples of how dedicated medical teams in other parts of the country are taking care of children and people affected with COVID-19, citing an example of a COVID-19 hospital in Bandra-Kurla Complex. Reports have suggested that about 2.2 % of the population in the country suffers from different kinds of physical and locomotor disability, which according to activists, is an understatement.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1f4rrw/article32752260.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KOLKATACORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/include-disabilities-in-kolkata-municipality-corporations-comorbidity-survey-say-activists/article32942312.ece

Both the projects, inaugurated by Minister for Excise and Labour T.P. Ramakrishnan on Monday, will be managed by a Community Development Society of the Kudumbasree Mission.

The municipal authorities say the She Lodge facility at Puthiyappu has been a long pending demand of women who come to the municipal area for training, interviews, official meetings and travel purposes.

The newly constructed two-storey building has amenities for accommodating 22 persons at a time.

Two air-conditioned double rooms apart from separate single and double rooms are available at the place at affordable rates. Dormitory facility is also available for eight people at a time.

As the project comes under a special component scheme, the fare of air-conditioned double rooms has been limited to ₹400 per head. Single rooms will be available at a daily rent of ₹300. While ordinary rooms are given at ₹250 per head, the dormitory facility can be availed at ₹150 per head. Continuous stay will be limited to three days as the service will have to be made available for all needy women.

The Pakalveedu project for senior citizens will offer an array of facilities, including medical and entertainment services. There are now facilities to admit 16 persons at a time. According to the municipal authorities, more such units would be set up based on the feedback of the elderly. Expenses for managing the facility will be borne by the municipality. There is also a plan to introduce pick-and-drop service for needy persons.

256,2020/10/26,Civic body polls: Thottathil Raveendran opts out of race,"First Mayor to complete five-year term in corpn., he was elected to council five times

Mayor Thottathil Raveendran has decided not to run for the Kozhikode Corporation council polls slated for December this year.

However, the 74-year-old popular Mayor will not hang up his political boots, possibly hinting to be in the electoral race for the Assembly polls next year. “Certainly, it is for the party to decide on my candidature,” Mr. Raveendran, who had been elected to the council for a record five times since 1979, told The Hindu on Monday. Incidentally, the post of the Mayor will be reserved for women for the next five years.

Clean image

Known for his clean image, Mr. Raveendran was the first Mayor to complete the full five-year term in office (2000-2005) since the formation of the Kozhikode Corporation in 1962. He also had a stint as Deputy Mayor during the 1995-2000 period and for a brief term of one month as Mayor in-charge in 1998.

The CPI(M) chose him to hold office from June 2016 after V.K.C. Mammed Koya, who was the Mayor, had to step down following his election to the Assembly from the Beypore segment. In the 2015 civic body polls, the party was compelled to field many leaders after facing anti- incumbency.

Mr. Raveendran was also the chairman of the Guruvayur Devaswom Board from 2007-11. It was during his time the management changed the centuries-old dress code, allowing women to wear churidars to enter the Sree Krishna temple. Previously, the custom insisted that only women clad in saris or traditional ‘mundu’ and ‘veshti’ could enter the shrine.

‘Radical changes’

He said that his five-year tenure had made some radical changes in the functioning of the corporation including a facility to obtain building permits without having to physically visit the office and also the smooth online payment of property tax. “These e-platforms have to go full- fledged enabling citizens to secure the services of the civic body,” Mr. Raveendran said. The Kozhikode Corporation, the Mayor said, had been able to achieve several milestones such as the full utilisation of the Plan fund. Apart from infrastructure development, the corporation had given top priority to prevent waterlogging during the monsoon. Some of the projects were implemented under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Rural Transformation (Amrut) project.

The newly constructed foot overbridge with escalator linking indoor stadium and the Kozhikode moffusil bus stand was the first of its kind in the State. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan would inaugurate the project, constructed under the Amrit Nagaram scheme at a cost of ₹11. 35 crore, on November 1, he said

Quality of governance

Mr. Raveendran claimed that the corporation had improved the quality of governance and municipal services to a great extent. “The city should have a perfect sewerage system as well as a waste treatment plant. These would come up in the near future. Also, corruption in the office has been reigned in, ” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/aligwm/article32947531.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27tvkzmayor,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/civic-body-polls-thottathil-raveendran-opts-out-of-race/article32947532.ece

258,2020/10/26,Passengers’ forum flays move to raise rail fares,"The Malabar Rail Users’ Forum has requested the Central government to refrain from the move to raise the rail tariff in the name of revenue generation. The forum has termed the move unscientific and has suggested several alternatives to improve revenue.

In a memorandum to the Railway authorities recently, the secretary of the forum, Manalil Mohanan, said that the move to raise the tariff, especially the minimum charge by three times, will adversely affect not just the passengers but the Railway employees and catering labourers. The conversion of passenger services into express services will result in more expense to the travellers while the number of stops will be cut.

The forum has suggested that MRMU services be run in the routes where there will no longer be passenger services and also that the stops for long distance trains should not be cut unless MEMU service starts. The forum suggested introduction of facilities to ensure clean food at reasonable rates while putting an end to the pantry cars in trains as non-availability of food is a major problem faced by long distance travellers.

As for revenue generation, the forum has suggested that the Railway get into courier service, cargo transportation in connection with airports and to make ticket checking more effective.

It has also suggested the auction of scraps and timber that have been abandoned in Railway station yards for years.

The forum suggested regular consultation with users’ forums across the country.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/passengers-forum-flays-move-to-raise-rail-fares/article32947357.ece

The man, suspected to be a gang leader of many such local criminal groups which target train passengers and parcels, was detained from Mumbai by a special squad led by RPF Inspector Vijayakumar.

According to RPF sources, the accused was mostly involved in major parcel thefts reported from the Konkan railway route. One of his close aides, Chetan Ramdas, had already been arrested by the squad. Mohiddin was arrested from Mumbai on October 24 and brought to the State on transit warrant. He was remanded in judicial custody on Monday.

RPF officials said that Mohiddin had about 10 years’ criminal history in executing well-planned parcel thefts. It was the frequent thefts at the Kannur railway parcel office that prompted the RPF to make a serious investigation.

260,2020/10/26,MP flays State ordinance on fish auction,"M.K. Raghavan, MP has come down heavily on the State government over its new ordinance in connection with the fisheries sector and has termed it as worse than the oppressive taxes imposed during the rule of kings in the country.

The MP, in a press release, said that the norms in the ordinance were unjust to fishing sector labourers, who though hailed as the State’s own navy during the floods, were the class that faced most hardships.

The fishing sector heavily depended on nature’s blessings. Due to climate change and pollution, the fish wealth of the State had been on a decline. Combined with the financial crisis brought on by COVID-19, many fishermen were on the verge of suicide. Yet, when they were slowly limping out of the crisis, the new ordinance had come as a new shock for them, the MP said.

Under the new ordinance that pertains to fish auction, the sale and quality control, auction can be held only at the government-designated places while only licensed auctioneers could take part in it. Besides, the government would get 5% of the proceeds as commission.

Mr. Raghavan said that this would adversely affect fishermen who went to the sea in small boats. The authorities did not even take into consideration the variation in quantity of fish yield in different season, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/mp-flays-state-ordinance-on-fish-auction/article32947332.ece
261,2020/10/26,Minister calls for efforts to check COVID-19 mortality rate,"Ayurvedic clinics for all districts to address post-COVID syndrome: Shylaja

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja has called for high alert by people as well as health workers to reduce the number of deaths due to COVID-19, pointing out that experts had predicted a high mortality rate in Kerala compared with other places.

Addressing the media after a review meeting here on Monday, she claimed that a majority of those who died in the State owing to COVID-19 had other health issues. The high prevalence of lifestyle diseases, high population density and a large number of senior citizens were some of the reasons. Constant vigil would be required to reduce the number of deaths. Telemedicine facilities would be set up at medical college hospitals to ensure individual attention to people who get admitted there.

Ms. Shylaja claimed that the death rate in the State since October this year was lower compared with that in previous years, even during the situation caused by the pandemic. She said quoting health experts that the infection spread was likely to come down by November. This was mainly due to the enforcement of the social distancing norms, wearing of face masks, and hand hygiene. The health systems, however, had been equipped to address a possible spike in cases.

Patients should not die due to lack of treatment facilities, she said. The Minister noted that directives had been issued to medical college hospitals to make required number of ventilators available to the patients. Sixty-eight ventilators had been set aside for COVID-19 patients at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. Only 14 among them were being used by patients now, She said.

Steps had also been taken to increase the number of beds with oxygen support. Right now, there was stock of 177 tonnes of oxygen, of which only 31 tonnes were being used daily. The Kozhikode MCH right now had 300 beds with oxygen support and 211 of them were being used now. Another 200 such beds would be set up. Ms. Shylaja claimed that there was a shortage of doctors though the government was trying to solve the issue.

Ayurvedic clinics would be set up in all districts to address the issue of post-COVID syndrome among people who had recovered from the infection, she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/minister-calls-for-efforts-to-check-covid-19-mortality-rate/article32947324.ece

266,2020/10/26,‘Spineless’ AIADMK will be taught a lesson in Assembly poll: Congress,"Party launches signature campaign against Farm Acts

The ruling “spineless AIADMK”, which is dancing to the tune of BJP-led Narendra Modi government at the Centre without resisting the anti-people and anti-farmer policies, would have to face the wrath of people of Tamil Nadu, All India Congress Committee secretary Sanjay Dutt has said.

Speaking to reporters here on Monday after kick-starting the signature campaign against the recently introduced farm laws, Mr. Sanjay Dutt said the BJP government enacted the “anti-farmer laws” in Parliament without debate even as Opposition parties were clamouring against it.

In order to highlight the resistance to the Acts, the Congress was conducting the signature campaign across the country and planned to takeout ‘tractor rallies’ against them from November 1 to 10 in all districts.

“Even as the BJP’s allies are opposing these laws and a Minister resigns from the Union Cabinet, the ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu supports the laws as it is dancing to the tune of the BJP for obvious reasons. Even after the Narendra Modi-led government is taking several regressive anti-Tamil Nadu and anti-Tamil measures, the AIADMK is helplessly watching it silently. The smart Tamil Nadu voters, who are angrily following this ‘puppet show’, will teach a fitting lesson in the ensuing Assembly polls to the AIADMK and its ally, the BJP,” Mr. Sanjay Dutt said.

He also alleged that the BJP government had miserably failed to protect women, the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes from all forms of aggressions and said the Congress would stage a nation-wide agitation against the atrocities on November 5.

267,2020/10/26,120 trees to be uprooted and relocated at Vaeinthankulam,"Construction activity at bus stand has prompted move

With new constructions coming up and existing structures being repaired at Vaeinthankulam bus stand, around 120 trees — 10 to 15 years old — have been uprooted and replanted along the tank that will brim with water during the northeast monsoon.

When renovation and construction activity started recently at the bus stand under the smart city programme, 106 trees on the premises, mostly neem, were in danger of being axed. When the Corporation updated Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish about the progress of work, she asked the civic body to explore the possibility of relocating the trees.

Sub-Collector, Tirunelveli, Siva Krishnamurthy inspected the trees that were to come under the axed and scouted for new locations where they could be replanted within the shortest possible time.

The Collector suggested that the uprooted trees be replanted along the bunds of the new-look Vaeinthankulam, which was desilted last year with public contribution of ₹12 lakh.

Corporation Commissioner G. Kannan consulted his counterparts in other urban local bodies and finally contacted Bharathiyar University, Coimbatore, for technical guidance from the Department of Environmental Sciences.

Bharathiyar University Vice-Chancellor P. Kaliraj selected A. Manimekalan of Department of Environmental Sciences and ‘Osai’ K. Syed Kattuva, Project Officer, for the project.

“We have to relocate 120 trees, including neem, pungan and nuna, to Vaeinthankulam bunds, which will consume a minimum of 30 days,” said Mr. Syed.

When the first tree was relocated on October 25 with Ms. Shilpa planting it, there was a drizzle.

When a crow’s nest with two eggs was found in a neem tree, it was left intact. “We will come to this tree only after the eggs hatch and the chicks fly away,” said Mr. Syed, who also spared another tree that nestled a squirrel’s home.

After replanting the trees, he explains to each one of them the situation that necessitated their relocation and assures it of every possible care to ensure their germination.

In order to relocate a tree, ₹6,500 is spent on slicing the branches to ensure easy transportation, applying cow dung to them and deploying heavy equipment to uproot, shift and replant in a new pit, taking thaai mann (original soil) in a lorry, and watering for some time.

Organic manure and coconut pith are also put in the pit. To avoid drying up of the branches and the trunk, the entire portion is covered with gunny bags, which are kept wet throughout the day by sprinkling water. The contractor involved in the renovation of the new bus stand readily came forward to bear all expenses.

Mr. Syed, who opposes felling of trees, said relocation of trees should be the last resort. “When the situation demands, we should always strive hard to relocate the tree to a conducive spot instead of slicing it,” he said.

On its part, Nam Tamirabharani Iyakkam has sowed seeds of palmyrah trees on the bund to make it stronger. “We have sowed 100 palmyrah seeds. We are getting 150 more,” said Nallaperumal of the Iyakkam that renovated Vaeinthankulam last year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/120-trees-to-be-uprooted-and-relocated-at-vaeinthankulam/article32946346.ece

The residential schools provided primary and secondary education to students living in remote areas.

However, the basic infrastructure required was not made available in some of the schools, he complained.

274,2020/10/26,Madurai GRH slowly starts resuming elective surgeries,"There is a rise in number of outpatients in the hospital

After spending many months primarily focusing on COVID-19 pandemic, Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai has slowly started performing elective surgeries with necessary safety precautions. Post relaxation of lockdown norms, the number of outpatients visiting the GRH is also on the rise.

In the wake of the COVID-19 positive cases, elective surgeries were put on hold in a number of government hospitals, including the GRH.

GRH Dean J. Sangumani said that emergency and semi-elective surgeries have picked up in the hospital in the last two months. A total of 3,210 surgeries for non-COVID-19 patients were performed across all departments in September, he said. ""Currently, on an average around 50 surgeries are being performed in the hospital everyday,"" he said.

The Dean said that a total of 237 surgeries have been performed for COVID-19 positive patients from April till date at GRH. ""If any patient displays clinical symptoms, we do a CT scan and test the patient for COVID-19. But, if it is an emergency situation, we do not wait for the test results and perform the surgery, as saving the patient's life is more important,"" said Dr. Sangumani.

K. Senthil, Treatment Coordinator for the COVID-19 speciality wing of GRH, said in case of COVID-19 positive patients, surgeries were performed only if there was an emergency.

A majority of the surgeries were performed in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology department of the GRH. Head of the department N. Sumathi said that apart from deliveries, elective surgeries like family planning procedures were also performed by the doctors.

Performing surgeries wearing personal protective equipment for long a duration is quite challenging for the doctors, added Dr. Sumathi. “Sometimes doctors feel suffocated while performing surgeries, leading to dehydration. So, another team of doctors are asked to be ready to continue with the surgery,” she added.

Concurring with this viewpoint, Dr. Senthil said that doctors were also advised to take short-duration breaks in between the surgeries.

Currently the number of outpatients visiting the GRH is around 90% of the outpatients who used to visit the hospital before the COVID-19 pandemic, said the Dean.

With the increase in inflow of people, the hospital is taking additional measures to manage crowds and ensure adherence to precautionary norms, said Dr. Sangumani. “Wash basins with soaps have been set installed within the hospital premises to ensure that the patients and attenders wash their hands frequently. We are also repeatedly announcing the attenders to maintain adequate personal distance from each other inside the hospital,” he added.

Dr. Senthil said that entry inside the GRH is allowed only through three gates in order to avoid crowding inside the hospital.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ssx3gc/article32949476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27MACITY-OUTPATIENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/madurai-grh-slowly-starts-resuming-elective-surgeries/article32943519.ece
275,2020/10/26,Plea to name Madurai Railway Station after NMR Subbaraman,"“It would be a fitting tribute for his yeomen services rendered to the ancient city, especially to the Dalits”

The members of Gandhi Memorial Museum Madurai have appealed to the Railway Minister to consider naming Madurai Railway Station as ‘Madurai Gandhi NMR Subbaraman Railway Station'.

In a letter addressed to the Union Minister, the Museum president T R Dinakaran said here on Monday that it would be apt to name the Railway Station after NMR Subbaraman as it would be a fitting tribute for his yeomen services rendered to the ancient city, especially to the Dalits.

From his student days, Subbaraman had always believed in the Swadeshi movement and was a close follower of Mahatma Gandhi in fighting the Britishers.

Though born in an affluent family, Subbaraman gave everything to the needy people and during the visit of Gandhi and Vinoba Bhave here, the family gave their many valuables including land to the landless through the Vinoba Bhave Movement.

Museum secretary K.M. Natarajan said that Subbaraman, who was a Member of Parliament from Madurai and chairman of Madurai Municipality, had established a number of institutions for girls education and health care for women from weaker sections. Many of them had celebrated 75 years recently since inception and were useful to the masses.

Subbaraman had formed a trust in memory of his wife in 1978 and through the revenue, it was intended for spending on higher education to poor girl children. In fact, the sprawling building in which he lived in Madurai, was given on a monthly rent of ₹1 to the Madurai Kamaraj University for a 25 year period.

Considering the services of the late leader, Madurai Railway Junction can be named after Subbaraman, they appealed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/plea-to-name-madurai-railway-station-after-nmr-subbaraman/article32942471.ece
276,2020/10/26,Two held for double murder near Madurai,"The arrests were made two weeks after the murder of Kunnathur panchayat president

Two weeks after the murder of Kunnathur Panchayat President, R. Krishnarajan, and a pump operator, A. Munisamy (40) near Karuppayoorani, Madurai district police have arrested two persons on Sunday.

The police identified the accused as P. Balaguru (26) of Kunnathur and K. Senthil (40) of Varichiyur. Senthil is younger brother of history-sheeter, ‘Varichiyur’ Selvam.

The police said that Senthil had developed enmity with Krishnarajan over the defeat of his wife, Malarvizhi, in the rural local body election and hence conspired with Balaguru to eliminate Krishnarajan.

The police said that Malarvizhi lost the election to the post of councillor of Ward 18 of East Union. However, Krishnarajan had supported her rival, Tamilarasi, who had won the election.

Besides, Balaguru, who is a relative of Krishnarajan, was angry over Krishnarajan, as he failed to keep his promise of getting him a tender. Senthil and Balaguru, who were friends, joined hands and murdered Krishnarajan and Munisamy when they were in an isolated place in Parai, Oomachikulam Deputy Superintendent of Police, Vijayakumar, said.

Local villagers had ransacked the houses of two other persons in the village suspecting them to be the accused.

278,2020/10/26,"On the moon, water everywhere but not a drop to drink yet","Earth is a wet world, with vast salty oceans, large freshwater lakes and ice caps that serve as water reservoirs.

The moon lacks the bodies of liquid water that are a hallmark of Earth but scientists said on Monday lunar water is more widespread than previously known, with water molecules trapped within mineral grains on the surface and more water perhaps hidden in ice patches residing in permanent shadows.

While research 11 years ago indicated water was relatively widespread in small amounts on the moon, a team of scientists is now reporting the first unambiguous detection of water molecules on the lunar surface. At the same time, another team is reporting that the moon possesses roughly 15,000 square miles (40,000 square kilometres) of permanent shadows that potentially could harbour hidden pockets of water in the form of ice.

Water is a precious resource and a relatively plentiful lunar presence could prove important to future astronaut and robotic missions seeking to extract and utilize water for purposes such as a drinking supply or a fuel ingredient.

A team led by Casey Honniball of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland detected molecular water on the lunar surface, trapped within natural glasses or between debris grains. Previous observations have suffered from ambiguity between water and its molecular cousin hydroxyl, but the new detection used a method that yielded unambiguous findings.

NEWS: We confirmed water on the sunlit surface of the Moon for the 1st time using @SOFIAtelescope. We don’t know yet if we can use it as a resource, but learning about water on the Moon is key for our #Artemis exploration plans. Join the media telecon at https://t.co/vOGoSHt74c pic.twitter.com/7p2QopMhod — Jim Bridenstine (@JimBridenstine) October 26, 2020

The only way for this water to survive on the sunlit lunar surfaces where it was observed was to be embedded within mineral grains, protecting it from the frigid and foreboding environment. The researchers used data from the SOFIA airborne observatory, a Boeing 747SP aircraft modified to carry a telescope.

“A lot of people think that the detection I've made is water ice, which is not true. It's just the water molecules - because they're so spread out they don't interact with each other to form water ice or even liquid water,” Honniball said.

The second study, also published in the journal Nature Astronomy, focused upon so-called cold traps on the moon, regions of its surface that exist in a state of perpetual darkness where temperatures are below about negative 260 degrees Fahrenheit (negative 163 degrees Celsius). That is cold enough that frozen water can remain stable for billions of years.

Using data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, researchers led by planetary scientist Paul Hayne of the University of Colorado, Boulder detected what may be tens of billions of small shadows, many no bigger than a small coin. Most are located in the polar regions.

“Our research shows that a multitude of previously unknown regions of the moon could harbor water ice,” Hayne said. “Our results suggest that water could be much more widespread in the moon's polar regions than previously thought, making it easier to access, extract and analyze.”

NASA is planning a return of astronauts to the moon, a mission envisioned as paving the way for a later journey carrying a crew to Mars. Accessible sources where water can be harvested on the moon would beneficial to those endeavours.

“Water is not just constrained to the polar region. It's more spread out than we thought it was,” Honniball said.

Another mystery that remains unsolved is the source of the lunar water.

“The origin of water on the moon is one of the big-picture questions we are trying to answer through this and other research,” Hayne said. “Currently, the major contenders are comets, asteroids or small interplanetary dust particles, the solar wind, and the moon itself through outgassing from volcanic eruptions.”

Earth is a wet world, with vast salty oceans, large freshwater lakes and ice caps that serve as water reservoirs.

“As our closest planetary companion, understanding the origins of water on the moon can also shed light on the origins of Earth's water - still an open question in planetary science,” Hayne added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/nprfpe/article32947194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NASA-MOON,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/on-the-moon-water-water-everywhere-and-not-a-drop-to-drink-yet/article32947195.ece
279,2020/10/26,New species of Echinops found in Sahyadri mountains,"It is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants and unique because of the size of its composite inflorescence

A Mumbai University M.Sc. (Botany) student is reported to have discovered a new species of Echinops Sahyadricus (English Common Name — Sahyadri Globe Thistle) from the Rajgad Fort in the Sahyadri mountains in collaboration with researchers of Fabio Conti of the University of Camerino, Italy, and Harshal Bhosale of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS).

Echinops is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants found in tropical and north Africa, the Mediterranean basin and West Asia, extending eastwards to China and Japan. The highest number of taxa (76) are concentrated in the Iranian plateau. Five species are found in India including two in Maharashtra.

The new species was discovered while the botanists were working on a project called “Assessing the endemic biodiversity of high elevational plateaus of northern western ghats” led by Mr. Bhosale.

“The new species is unique because of the size of its composite inflorescence which measures up to 9 cm in diameter that is relatively large compared to other Echinops species found around the world,” said Sushant More, M.Sc., Sathaye College, Mumbai University, who discovered the species.

“I love to study the angiosperms AKA flowering plants and love exploring the western ghats mountains,” he said on the reason why he ventured into the project as part of the curriculum. The team worked last year during the monsoon, he said.

The discovery and the research paper has been published in the Nordic Journal of Botany, an international scientific journal.

The species is endemic to Western Maharashtra and found only on a few open hilltops in the northern western ghats. It is named after the Sahyadri mountains.

As per the research paper, the new species is close to other Indian species called Echinops echinatus AKA Indian Globe thistle and one European species called Echinops sphaerocephalus. But it differs in size of inflorescence, types of whorls of spine-like Bracts around the floret and type of leaves surface.

“In India, Echinops is represented by five taxa out of which three, E. cornigerus DC, E. niveus Wall and E. prionolepis Bornm & Mattf are restricted to the Himalayas and neighbouring areas,” the paper said.

Echinops rajasthanensis R.P. Pandey & V. Singh is endemic to Rajasthan and E. echinatus Roxb is seen throughout India, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Myanmar in dry open scrub lands, it said.

It grows vegetatively on open grassy slopes of mountains in four months of monsoon and blooms in November. Fruiting can be seen in December.

The researchers said projects like road widening in the ghats and construction activities on forts could affect populations of this species and this should be protected at all costs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/q6sen6/article32944265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Flower-Head,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/new-species-of-echinops-found-in-sahyadri-mountains/article32944224.ece
280,2020/10/26,"‘Interest-on-interest waiver to cost exchequer ₹7,500 crore’","About 75% of borrowers will benefit, a Crisil analysis shows

More than 40% of system credit and 75% of borrowers stand to benefit from interest-on-interest concession announced by the government, an analysis by Crisil Ratings showed.

It indicated that the ex-gratia payment of interest-on-interest by banks and non-banking financial companies for the moratorium period (between March 1 and August 31) would amount to ₹7,500 crore of benefit for eligible borrowers. Lenders will not be impacted as the Centre had agreed to pick up the tab.

The benefit will be extended to borrowers with outstanding loans (standard as on February 29, 2020) of less than ₹2 crore under select categories, irrespective of whether the moratorium was availed of or not.

Such loans account for more than 40% of systemic credit and 75% of borrowers, Crisil said. The cost to the exchequer would have halved if the waiver were allowed only for cases where moratorium was availed of, it added.

The government has asked lenders to credit the amount to eligible borrowers by November 05, 2020.

The amount will be the difference between compound interest and simple interest over six months (March 1 to August 31).

Borrowers who had availed of higher-yielding loans would benefit more than others.

281,2020/10/26,"Reliance, Future commit to conclude the deal despite Amazon’s legal challenge","The company said that it was not a party to the agreement under which Amazon has invoked arbitration proceedings.

A day after Amazon Inc. secured an interim order from Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) restraining Future Retail Ltd. (FRL) and Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. (RRVL) to go ahead with their ₹24,713 crore assets acquisition deal, Future Retail said it was not party to the agreement under which Amazon has invoked arbitration proceedings and it would proceed with the proposed transaction ‘unhindered’ without any delay.

RRVL has also said that it would enforce its rights without delay.

“The company has received a communication from the SIAC, enclosing an interim order of the Emergency Arbitrator in the arbitration proceedings under shareholders’ agreement between Amazon, Future Coupons Private Ltd. and the promoter group,” Future Retail informed the BSE.

“The company is examining the communication and the order. It may be noted that the company is not a party to the agreement under which Amazon has invoked arbitration proceedings,” it said.

In a regulatory filing, the company said it had been legally advised that actions taken by the FRL or its board, which are in full compliance with the relevant agreements and eminently in the interest of all stakeholders cannot be held back in arbitration proceedings initiated under an agreement to which FRL is not a party.

“As per the advice received by FRL, all relevant agreements are governed by Indian law and provisions of Indian Arbitration Act... and this matter raises several fundamental jurisdictional issues which go to the root of the matter. Accordingly, this order will have to be tested under the provisions of Indian Arbitration Act in an appropriate forum,” it said.

“In any enforcement proceedings, FRL would take appropriate steps to ensure that the proposed transaction will proceed unhindered without any delay,” it added.

In a statement issued late Sunday, RRVL, the subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), said it had entered into the transaction for acquisition of assets and business of Future Retail Ltd. under proper legal advice and “the rights and obligations are fully enforceable under Indian law.”

“RRVL intends to enforce its rights and complete the transaction in terms of the scheme and agreement with Future group without any delay,” it added.

Soon after the order, an Amazon spokesperson said, “We are grateful for the order which grants all the reliefs that were sought. We remain committed to an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration process.”

“SIAC’s decision to put a stay on the sale of Future Group’s consumer business to RIL is unlikely to impact the latter’s credit profile, given its position as the leading retailer in India and its strong financial position.” Sweta Patodia, analyst, Corporate Finance Group, Moody’s Investors Service said.

“Nonetheless, the decision will likely delay RIL’s plans to expand its retail footprint in India,” she added.

282,2020/10/26,Govt. may extend soft loans to grain-based distilleries to boost ethanol production,"Petroleum and Food Ministries are of the opinion that ethanol production cannot rely solely on sugarcane.

To boost ethanol production in the country, the government is considering extending subsidised loans to grain-based distilleries also under the ongoing scheme, according to government sources.

The sources said both the petroleum and food ministries are of the view that ethanol production cannot be dependent on one feedstock, that is, sugarcane, for achieving the target of 20% ethanol blending with petrol by 2030.

There is a need to look at other agri-feedstock such as rice, maize, sorghum and barley for making ethanol. After several rounds of discussion, both the ministries are of the opinion to extend soft loans to grain-based distilleries as well under the ongoing scheme, the sources said.

As part of an incentive scheme announced in June 2018, the Centre had approved soft loans for sugar mills to set up new distilleries or upgrade the existing ones, expand capacity, and encourage them to divert sugarcane to ethanol making.

Under the scheme, the government has extended twice the interest subvention that comes up to ₹4,600 crore for a loan amount of ₹22,000 crore.

A proposal to modify the existing scheme to include grain-based distilleries would require Cabinet approval, the preparation for which are going on at present, the sources said and added that unused funds under the current scheme will be used for this.

The sources also mentioned that the grains-based distilleries association says that they have at present 75 crore litres capacity for ethanol making. Oil marketing companies have floated tenders for buying grain-based ethanol from them.

When the scheme was launched in 2018, the sources said the government had approved soft loans to sugar mills for augmenting about 195 crore litres of ethanol capacity. Out of which, 101 crore litres capacity is available for use now and the balance will be ready by 2022.

In September-October this year, the government received about 400 applications from sugar mills for installation of 400 crore litres ethanol capacity availing soft loan facility under the scheme. The applications are being vetted now.

In the wake of enhanced ethanol capacities and good cane crop, the government has estimated that over 300 crore litres plus ethanol would be available for blending in 2020-21, much higher than 180 crore litres in 2019-20.

Currently, India has a total 426 ethanol capacity, of which about 130 crore litres capacity is used for making other products like portable liquor and sanitisers. The rest is available for ethanol making.

With an expected increase in supply of ethanol this year, the government hopes to achieve the target of 10% ethanol blending in 2020-21.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hx1km7/article29323369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THSUGARCANE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/govt-may-extend-soft-loans-to-grain-based-distilleries-to-boost-ethanol-production/article32943547.ece

286,2020/10/26,"SEBI bans Birla Pacific Medspa, Yashovardhan Birla, 8 others from securities markets for 2 years","SEBI has barred Birla Pacific Medspa Ltd, Yashovardhan Birla and eight others from the securities market for two years for mis-utilisation of the IPO proceeds.

Birla Pacific Medspa Ltd (BPML), which came out with offer documents in March 2011, had floated its over Rs 65-core initial public offering (IPO) in June 2011.

The regulator found that the company made misstatements in the prospectus in respect of the objects of the IPO.

While around 75% of the IPO proceeds were promised to be utilised in setting up of Evolve Medspa centres under the ‘objects of the issue’ in the prospectus, no such centres ultimately have been set up, SEBI said.

Similarly, while 15 such centres were promised to be set up by the end of March 2012, but not even a single centre was set up by that time, it added.

On the contrary, SEBI said, 50% of the IPO proceeds or ₹31.54 crore were deployed as inter-corporate deposits (ICDs) to group companies, out of which 60% of ICD’s were never returned to the company.

This was in stark contrast to the objects of the IPO or the interim use of funds as stated in the prospectus.

The prospectus permitted the interim deployment of proceeds as an investment in liquid instruments only and did not permit such deployment of funds as ICDs.

“The fact that funds of IPO proceeds would be deployed as ICDs to group companies of BPML as against the setting up of Evolve Centers was never disclosed in the prospectus. In fact, the prospectus never contemplated that funds would be deployed as ICDs to group companies within five days from the receipt of IPO proceeds without any event of exigency,” SEBI noted.

The statements in the prospectus relating to ‘objects of the issue’ and ‘interim use of funds’ were untrue and inadequate on material terms, Sebi said in an order passed on Friday.

Through such acts, the entities violated the provisions of ICDR (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations.

Accordingly, SEBI has barred the company, Yashovardhan Birla and eight other individuals from accessing the securities market and further prohibited them from buying, selling or otherwise dealing in securities for two years, while one individual has been prohibited from the capital markets for six months.

These individuals were the signatories to the prospectus of Birla Pacific Medspa, the order noted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/4tjsx7/article32726237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THBUSEBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/sebi-bans-birla-pacific-medspa-yashovardhan-birla-8-others-from-securities-markets-for-2-years/article32943563.ece

Mr. Goenka further added that market participants would look to adjust their positioning across asset classes ahead of the U.S. elections next week.

“We could see some risk on bets being rolled back. The overall mood is likely to be that of caution. Markets would also become less hopeful of a pre-election agreement on fiscal stimulus between the Democrats and the White House,” he said.
