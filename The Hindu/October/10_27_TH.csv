Researchers at Stanford University have collaborated with Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT) to develop ultra high-resolution organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display with up to 10,000 pixels per inch (PPI) resolution.

The new OLED display architecture was developed using existing designs for electrodes of solar panels, and could be used in televisions, smartphones, and virtual or augmented reality devices, according to a Stanford release.

“Our designs worked really well for solar cells and now we have a chance to impact next generation displays,” Mark Brongersma, a Stanford professor and an author of the research paper said.

The displays will be able to produce high-quality images with true-to-life detail because of the high pixel density, and could give a better user experience when used in headset displays designed for virtual or augmented reality.

Each pixel in an OLED display is composed of smaller sub-pixels that produce red, green or blue colour. When the resolution is sufficiently high, the pixels are perceived as one colour by the human eye, it explained.

The displays could serve as alternatives for red-green-blue (RGB) OLED displays – used in smaller devices like smartphones, as well as white OLED displays – used in larger devices like televisions.

The new OLED displays would also be brighter and have better colour accuracy than existing versions, and they’d be much easier and cost-effective to produce as well. Further, integrating this work into a full-size display is being pursued by Samsung, according to Stanford.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/3xakhr/article32955988.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OLED,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/samsung-stanford-develop-oled-display-with-10000-ppi-resolution/article32956068.ece
1,2020/10/27,"State-sponsored hackers are diversifying tactics, report says","This includes techniques used to steal user authentication credentials like usernames and passwords to allow attackers to move across the network to compromise other systems and accounts while disguised as a valid user.

Some of the world’s most skilled nation-state cyber adversaries are diversifying tactics to inflict more harm, a report by consulting firm Accenture said.

These ransomware gangs are deploying an arsenal of new open-sourced tools, actively exploiting corporate email systems and using online extortion to scare victims into paying ransoms, Accenture stated in the ‘2020 Cyber Threatscape Report’.

Throughout this year, suspected state-sponsored and organised criminal groups have been using a combination of off-the-shelf tools to carry out cyberattacks. This includes ‘living off the land’ tools which refer to the network infrastructure already available in the target environment.

Other tools include shared hosting infrastructure and publicly developed exploit codes.

In the study, Accenture tracked the patterns and activities of an Iran-based hacker group called SOURFACE. The group is known for its cyberattacks on oil and gas, communications and transportation businesses in the U.S., Israel, Europe and Saudi Arabia.

It observed that the group used legitimate Windows functions and freely available exploitation tools like Mimikatz for credential dumping.

This technique is used to steal user authentication credentials like usernames and passwords to allow attackers to move across the network to compromise other systems and accounts while disguised as a valid user.

These actors will continue to use off-the-shelf penetration tools owing to their effectiveness and cost efficiency, the report noted.

Ransomware became a more lucrative business model in the past year. The criminals behind Maze, Sodinokibi and DoppelPayner ransomware strains are the pioneers of the growing tactics, which is delivering bigger profits and resulting in a wave of copycat actors and new ransomware peddlers.

In businesses, the LockBit ransomware emerged earlier this year, which gained attention due to its self-spreading feature that quickly infects other computers on a corporate network.

The company also tracked cybercriminals on Dark Web forums, and found them to be advertising regular updates and improvements to the ransomware. They were also actively recruiting new members promising a portion of the ransom money.

App Store applications and in-app purchases to cost more in India as Apple adds 2% equalisation levy.

""When taxes or foreign exchange rates change, we sometimes need to update prices on the App Store,"" Apple said in a statement.

The new equalisation levy of 2% is in addition to the existing goods and services tax of 18%, Apple added.

The levy is applicable on the online sales of any goods or provision of any services by or through a non-resident e-commerce operator.

The levy was initially introduced in the Finance Act 2016, and amended four years later in the Finance Act 2020 at 2%.

Apple has also updated its prices for app and in-app purchases on the App Store in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Russia, South Africa, Iceland and Albania.

The Pricing and Availability section of My Apps will be updated, once the changes are effective. The proceeds will be adjusted and calculated based on the tax-exclusive price, Apple said.

The iPhone maker said it will implement the changes in the next few days, but this will exclude the apps with auto-renewable subscriptions.

However, the company will allow the developers to change the price of their apps and in-app purchases including auto-renewable subscriptions. This can be done at any time in App Store Connect.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/3okyp/article32952486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/images-2-1jpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/app-store-apps-in-app-purchases-to-get-expensive-in-india/article32952431.ece

Facebook launched several cloud-streamed games for its 380 million gamers on the app and browser that can be played instantly without downloading.

It is not a separate cloud gaming service, Facebook clarified in a blog post on Monday. All cloud-streamed games are playable in the Gaming tab or from the News Feed. No special hardware or controllers will be required and all games can be played with a mouse and keyboard on the desktop.

Cloud gaming will increase and not replace PC or console gaming that is likely to stick around for a long time, Facebook said. All games in the initial stages will be free of cost.

Facebook's cloud games will initially be available only to Android and web users, and the company said it will work on alternate gaming options for iOS users. With Apple's new cloud games policy, launching on the App Store is not a viable path, the California-based company stated. “Apple treats games differently and continues to exert control over a very precious resource,” Facebook stated.

Facebook also announced the beta version of cloud games on Facebook Gaming, starting with a range of mobile-native games in Android APK formats. The first set of games available include Asphalt 9: Legends, Mobile Legends: Adventure, WWE Supercard and PGA TOUR Golf Shootout.

Starting 2021, the service will offer additional games in different genres, along with the launch of in-app purchases and ads, depending on the game’s format and developer choice.

Among Us, the viral multi-player online game has been hit with a massive spam attack that is promoting a mysterious online handle, Eric Loris.

Last week, players across the globe noticed their in-game chat logins were filled with messages promoting Loris’ YouTube channel. Some messages threatened users of hacking their devices if they did not subscribe.

Other messages asked players to vote for Trump, along with the YouTube promotion.

“I hate it here, I just want to play a simple game without eric loris PLEASE,” wrote a user on Twitter.

“Hey guys, Among Us is getting hacked. The rooms get blacked out, players get kicked off, and a red character spams this nonsense,” wrote another player.

While many players called this the most annoying hack ever and requested the developer to address the issue.

Developer InnerSloth said Thursday it was aware of the current hacking trouble and the team was looking into it. It advised users to play private games or with people they trust.

According to a Eurogamer report, the hacker claims to have 50 computers to ‘add more fire power’ to the attack. The spam attack is claimed to have hit 1.5 million games, affecting about 5 million players.

InnerSloth developer Forest Willard rolled out an emergency server update last week. He said that delay in update was to avoid false positive.

Another wave of anti-hacks was launched recently that Willard says should resolve chat spam.

“Wave 2 is fully out. I am aware of some bugs, but it does seem like it was pretty effective,” Willard wrote on Twitter.

He added that not all hacks are blocked but banning or finding another room should be viable again.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/1dur8a/article32951481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/among-usjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/among-us-online-game-hit-with-massive-spam-attack/article32951447.ece

China's top cyber authority said on Monday it would carry out a “rectification” of Chinese mobile internet browsers to address what it called social concerns over the “chaos” of information being published online.

China's strict internet censorship rules have been tightened numerous times in recent years and in the latest crackdown, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has told firms operating mobile browsers that they have until Nov. 9 to conduct a “self examination” and rectify problems.

The problems include the spreading of rumours, the use of sensationalist headlines and the publishing of content that violates the core values of socialism, it said in a statement.

“For some time, mobile browsers have grown in an uncivilised way ... and have become a gathering place and amplifier for dissemination of chaos by 'self-media',” the CAC said, referring to independently operated social media accounts, many of which publish news.

“After the rectification, mobile browsers that still have outstanding problems will be dealt with strictly according to laws and regulations until related businesses are banned.”

The campaign will initially focus on eight of the most influential mobile browsers in China, including those operated by Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, Alibaba Group Holding's UCWeb and Xiaomi Corp, it said.

Others include the QQ platform owned by Tencent, Qihoo-owned 360, Oppo and Sogou.

A U.S. appeals court on Monday rejected a Justice Department request that it allow the government to immediately ban Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google from offering Tencent's WeChat for download in U.S. app stores.

The three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said in a brief order the government had not demonstrated it would “suffer an imminent, irreparable injury during the pendency of this appeal, which is being expedited.”

On Friday, a U.S. judge in San Francisco rejected a Justice Department request to reverse her decision preventing the WeChat ban sought by the U.S. Commerce Department in response to a lawsuit filed by WeChat users.

The WeChat users said the ruling will avoid an “unprecedented shutdown of a major platform for communications relied on by millions of people in the United States.”

Social media company Twitter Inc on Monday flagged a tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump about mail-in ballots, adding a disclaimer describing the post's content as “disputed” and potentially misleading.

“Big problems and discrepancies with Mail In Ballots all over the USA. Must have final total on November 3rd”, Trump tweeted late on Monday, with the tweet giving no evidence for his assertion.

“Some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about how to participate in an election or another civic process”, Twitter's disclaimer said. The disclaimer included a link to a page highlighting how mail voting was legal and safe.

Just a week ahead of the Nov. 3 election, President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden are criss-crossing the country on Tuesday in an intense day of campaigning, with Mr. Biden making a thrust into traditional Republican territory in a show of optimism.

Leading his Republican rival in national opinion polls, Mr. Biden landed in Georgia, which has not supported a Democrat in a U.S. presidential election since 1992.

He was due to speak in Warm Springs, at the vacation home of former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Democrat who led the nation of the Great Depression and through World War Two. A banner reading “Battle for the soul of the nation” hung above the stage where Mr. Biden was to speak.

Mr. Trump will hold rallies in three states key to his re-election hopes: Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska.

The 2020 presidential campaign has been unlike any other as a raging coronavirus pandemic that has so far killed more then 225,000 Americans pushes record early voting.

In another show of confidence in the Mr. Biden camp, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Tuesday he will spend around $15 million on television advertising in Texas and Ohio in the coming days.

Texas has long been seen as a bridge too far for Democrats in a presidential election and not worth the expenditure in the last days of a campaign.

Bloomberg, who lost to Mr. Biden in a crowded field for the Democratic nomination, decided to make the ad buys after reviewing polling data from multiple states on Monday, a spokesperson said by email.

In Georgia, opinion polls show the race to be tight, and a win by Mr. Biden there would likely be a severe blow to Mr. Trump’s chances. Mr. Biden told reporters on Monday he believes he has a ”fighting chance” to take Georgia.

He will hold an afternoon event in Warm Springs, Georgia, before capping the day with an evening rally in Atlanta.

The aggressive move also carries risks for Mr. Biden, whose trip to Georgia precludes visits to more traditional battleground states that can swing toward either party’s candidate.

Early votes

More than 66 million votes have been cast so far, approaching half the total 2016 vote, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.

The huge volume of mail ballots could take days or weeks to tally, experts have said. Mail voting is nothing new for the United States - about one in four ballots were cast that way in 2016 - but is surging amid the pandemic.

Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly and without evidence claimed that mailed ballots are likely to be subject to fraud, on Monday said on Twitter: “Must have final total on November 3rd.” Twitter flagged the tweet with a disclaimer describing the post’s content as “disputed” and potentially misleading.

Mr. Trumps planned rally in Nebraska, meanwhile, suggests his campaign is preparing for a close finish. The state apportions three of its five electoral votes by majority vote in its three congressional districts, with the Omaha-area district a potential pick-up opportunity for Mr. Biden while the rest of the state is expected to go for Mr. Trump.

In a scenario where Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden finish close to a tie in the U.S. Electoral College, that Omaha district with its single vote could make the difference of clinching the 270th elector needed to win. Mr. Trump’s rally is also likely to draw attendees from neighboring Iowa, another state that is likely to be competitive.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump also stages rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin - two states he won by narrow margins in 2016 but where polls show him now trailing Mr. Biden - before stopping overnight in Nevada.

Mr. Trump will be able to tout the confirmation of his nominee Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court. Barrett cleared the Senate on Monday and was sworn in during a night-time outdoor ceremony at the White House, meeting the president’s goal of having her on the court by Election Day.

In a string of early morning posts on Twitter on Tuesday, Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Biden’s potential handling of the top court, and again played down the COVID-19 pandemic despite the record numbers of new U.S. cases in recent days.

Former President Barack Obama was also back on the trail in Florida on Tuesday to boost Mr. Biden, his former vice president.

At a drive-in rally in Orlando, Mr. Obama attacked Mr. Trump’s record on the coronavirus and urged Democrats to vote in large numbers to avoid a repeat of the 2016 election when Mr. Trump won the battleground state and defeated Hillary Clinton.

12,2020/10/27,Thailand protesters ask Germany to investigate King,"Their demands include resignation of PM, constitutional changes and reforms to the monarchy.

Pro-democracy demonstrators in Thailand have expanded their protests internationally, marching to the German Embassy to appeal to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government to investigate whether Thailand’s King has exercised political power during his extended stays in Bavaria.

The protesters acted while criticising their own Parliament, which began a special two-day session earlier Monday to address political tensions resulting from the near-daily pro-democracy protests demanding the Prime Minister’s resignation, constitutional changes and reforms to the monarchy.

They believe the King wields an inordinate amount of power in what is nominally a democracy under a constitutional monarchy.

The scrutiny and public criticism of the monarchy displayed by some of the protesters is unprecedented in a country where the royal institution has been considered sacrosanct. It has also led royalists to stage counter-rallies.

Letter to Embassy

The protesters, between 5,000 and 10,000, defied police warnings that they constituted an illegal assembly and marched to the embassy in an effort to bring attention to the time King Maha Vajiralongkorn spends in Germany. The King in recent weeks has been in Thailand with a schedule of ceremonial events.

A statement from the protest group said they presented a letter to Embassy officials asking that Germany investigate whether the king “has conducted Thai politics using his royal prerogative from German soil or not.”

The German government already brought up the issue in early October, when Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, responding to a question in Parliament, expressed concern over any political activities the King might be conducting in the country.

On Monday in Berlin, Mr. Maas said the government was following developments in Thailand and was aware of the demonstrations and “people taking to the streets for their rights.” He added that he also was watching the King’s activities in Germany.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gredxx/article32957817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-TOPSHOT-THAILAND-ROYALS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/thailand-protesters-ask-germany-to-investigate-king/article32957818.ece
13,2020/10/27,California wildfires force major evacuation,"1,00,000 affected; power supply hit.

Fast-moving wildfires forced evacuation orders for more than 1,00,000 people and seriously injured two firefighters in Southern California on Monday as powerful winds across the state prompted power to be cut to hundreds of thousands to prevent utility equipment from sparking new blazes.

A smoky fire exploded in size to over 29 sq. km after breaking out around dawn in Orange County, south of Los Angeles. Gusts pushed flames along brushy ridges in Silverado Canyon and near houses in the sprawling city of Irvine, home to about 2,80,000 residents. There was no containment.

Nearby, a much smaller fire in the Yorba Linda area prompted the evacuation of at least 10,000 people, officials said.

14,2020/10/27,Philadelphia police shooting of Black man sparks unrest,"30 police officers injured in the face-off with protesters.

Police shot and killed a 27-year-old Black man on a Philadelphia street after yelling at him to drop his knife, sparking violent protests that police said injured 30 officers and led to dozens of arrests.

The shooting occurred before 4 p.m. on Monday as officers responded to a report of a person with a weapon, police spokesperson Tanya Little said.

Officers were called to the Cobbs Creek neighbourhood and encountered the man, later identified as Walter Wallace, who was holding a knife, Ms. Little said. Officers ordered Wallace to drop the knife, but he instead “advanced towards” them. Both officers then fired “several times,” Ms. Little said.

Wallace was hit in the shoulder and chest. One of the officers then put him in a police vehicle and drove him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later, she said.

Police cars and dumpsters were set on fire as police struggled to contain the crowds.

Thirty officers were injured, most of them from being struck by projectiles such as bricks and rocks, according to preliminary information from police. .

Video of the fatal confrontation recorded by a bystander and posted on social media shows officers pointing their guns at Wallace as he walks in the street and around a car. He walks toward the officers as they back away from him in the street, guns still aimed at him. They yell at him to put his knife down.

Both then fire several shots and Wallace collapses in the street.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1yh1wk/article32957784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-PHILADELPHIAPOLICESHOOTING1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/philadelphia-police-shooting-of-black-man-sparks-unrest/article32957785.ece

Around 10,000 people in Bangladesh rallied in the South Asian nation’s capital on Tuesday to protest France’s President Immanuel Macron and his staunch support of secular laws that deem caricatures depicting the Prophet Muhammad as protected under freedom of speech.

Protesters from the conservative Islami Andolon Bangladesh group, which supports the introduction of Islamic law in the Muslim-majority country, carried banners and placards reading: “All Muslims of the world, unite” and “Boycott France.” It was the largest protest yet against the cartoons in recent days.

16,2020/10/27,France boycott call pushes Turkey ‘even further’ from EU,"‘Erdogan’s support for a boycott of French goods a setback’.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s support for a boycott of French goods is a further setback to Turkey’s already stalled bid to join the EU, the European Commission said on Tuesday.

“Calls for boycott of products of any member state are contrary to the spirit of these obligations and will take Turkey even further away from the European Union,” a spokesman said.

Accession talks

Turkey applied to join the then European Economic Community in 1987 and began formal accession negotiations to the European Union in 2005, but the talks are seen as effectively frozen.

Protests erupted in several mainly-Muslim countries after President Emmanuel Macron defended a cartoonist’s right to caricature religious leaders in the wake of a French teacher’s murder.

History teacher Samuel Paty was killed in the street on October 16 after a social media campaign criticised him for showing students cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed during a lesson on free speech.

Turkey has condemned the murder, but Mr. Erdogan has also resumed his long-standing and intense war of words with Mr. Macron, and has added his voice to calls for a boycott of French goods.

This is turn has been criticised by several European leaders, exacerbating the tensions surrounding Turkey’s bid to drill for gas in waters claimed by EU members Greece and Cyprus.

Now, the European Commission, which oversees the EU application process, has warned that an official boycott would breach the terms of Turkey’s relationship with the bloc.

“EU agreements with Turkey foresee free trade of goods,” the spokesman said.

“The bilateral obligations that Turkey has committed to under these agreements, as expressed in the Association Agreement, the Customs Union and the agricultural and coal and steel FTAs, should be fully respected.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rkxaut/article31958660.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EUFLAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/france-boycott-call-pushes-turkey-even-further-from-eu/article32957012.ece
17,2020/10/27,Hong Kong arrests 3 activists under national security law,"The three include former Studentlocalism leader Tony Chung and former members William Chan and Yanni Ho

Three members of a former student group advocating independence for Hong Kong were arrested Tuesday under the city’s new national security law on suspicion of publishing content inciting secession on social media platforms.

The three include former Studentlocalism leader Tony Chung and former members William Chan and Yanni Ho. The arrests of the three were confirmed on the now-disbanded group’s Facebook page.

Police said they arrested two men and one woman between the ages of 17 and 21 on secession charges, but did not name them.

Mr. Chung was arrested near the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning, a police official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. The other two were detained while reporting to police stations, Studentlocalism said.

The three had previously been arrested under the national security law in July, on charges of inciting secession.

Studentlocalism was a student group in the city that advocated localism, and aimed to set up a Republic of Hong Kong. Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed over to China in 1997 and now runs as a semi-autonomous Chinese territory under the one country, two systems framework that allows Hong Kong certain freedoms not found on the mainland.

In June, the group announced that it ceased activities in the city in light of the national security legislation.

The law, which was imposed on Hong Kong by the central Chinese government and took effect on June 30, is widely seen as a means to curb dissent after anti-government protests rocked the city for months last year.

The legislation outlaws secessionist, subversive and terrorist acts, as well as collusion with foreign forces in the city’s internal affairs. The maximum punishment for serious offenders is life imprisonment.

Others who have been arrested under the legislation include media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who founded the pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily, and prominent pro-democracy activist Agnes Chow.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xtz6kr/article32956164.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Chungjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hong-kong-arrests-3-activists-under-national-security-law/article32955974.ece
18,2020/10/27,"Poland’s PM defends abortion ruling, condemns protests","Protesters called for the women to have the right of choice.

Poland’s prime minister on Tuesday defended the tightening of the country’s abortion law and condemned massive nationwide protests led by women’s rights activists, saying they shouldn’t be happening amid heightened coronavirus restrictions and decrying acts of aggression.

Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki was reacting to five days of massive protests across Poland against a ruling Thursday by the country’s top court that declared abortions due to fetal congenital defects unconstitutional.

On Monday, protesters led by women’s rights activists blocked traffic for hours in most cities and also gathered outside churches, chanting obscenities against Poland’s influential Catholic Church leaders, who condemn abortions.

They called for the women to have the right of choice.

In order to have the freedom of choice you first must be alive, Mr. Morawiecki, whose conservative government backs tight restrictions, said in defending the court’s ruling.

Mr. Morawiecki added that the situations that we are seeing in the streets and which amount to acts of aggression, vandalism, attacks, are absolutely inadmissible, should not be taking place at all.

The prime minister urged everyone to observe restrictions that ban gatherings of more than five people in an effort to fight a sudden spike in coronavirus cases.

The Constitutional Tribunal’s ruling tightened what was already one of Europe’s most restrictive abortion laws. When it takes effect, abortion will be permitted only when a pregnancy threatens the woman’s health or is the result of crime like rape or incest.

19,2020/10/27,"Stop sowing discord between China, regional countries: Beijing on Pompeo’s visit to India","After his India visit, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due to visit Sri Lanka and the Maldives

China on October 27 urged U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to stop sowing discord between Beijing and countries in the region, undermining the regional peace and stability, amidst his visit to India for a high-level dialogue aimed at further ramping up their overall defence and security ties, and boost strategic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.

Mr. Pompeo arrived in India on October 26 along with Defence Secretary Mark T. Esper for the third edition of the U.S.-India 2+2 dialogue with their counterparts, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.

After his India visit, Mr. Pompeo is due to visit Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

Asked about Mr. Pompeo’s visit to India and other South Asian countries during which the top U.S. diplomat’s focus would be on China’s threats, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing in Beijing that Mr. Pompeo’s attacks and accusations against China are nothing new.

He repeated time and again, Mr. Wang said.

“These are groundless accusations which reflect that he is clinging to the Cold War mentality and ideological biases. We urge him to abandon the Cold War and the zero-sum game mentality and stop sowing discord between China and regional countries as well as undermining the regional peace and stability,” Mr. Wang said.

His remarks came amidst India and the U.S. signing the landmark Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) that will allow sharing of high-end military technology, classified satellite data and critical information between the two countries.

The signing of the long-negotiated BECA between the two strategic partners also signals further boosting of bilateral defence and military ties, and it comes in the backdrop of India’s tense border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh.

In August, Mr. Pompeo said that China poses a threat to the West that is in some ways worse than that posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

What’s happening now isn’t Cold War 2.0. The challenge of resisting the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) threat is in some ways worse. The CCP is already enmeshed in our economies, in our politics, in our societies in ways the Soviet Union never was, he had said in a speech to the Czech Senate.

In July, Mr. Pompeo criticised China for its aggressive moves against its neighbours, including “instigating” a deadly confrontation with India in eastern Ladakh, saying Beijing cannot threaten countries and bully them in the Himalayas.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will travel to Sri Lanka on Tuesday for a two-day visit during which he will hold talks with the top Sri Lankan leadership, as America seeks to balance China’s growing influence in the region and to advance the common goals for a free and open Indo-Pacific.

Mr. Pompeo arrived in India on Monday along with Defence Secretary Mark T Esper for the third edition of the U.S.-India 2+2 dialogue with their counterparts in New Delhi.

After his India visit, Mr. Pompeo will travel to Sri Lanka later on Tuesday on an invitation extended by his Sri Lankan counterpart Dinesh Gunawardena.

Satisfied that Indo-U.S. ties have grown in every domain: Pompeo-Jaishankar meeting

Mr. Pompeo, the highest-level U.S. official to visit Sri Lanka during the tenure of President Donald Trump, will hold official discussions with the Lankan leadership covering several areas of the multifaceted engagement between the two countries.

The top U.S. diplomat will hold talks in Colombo on October 28, Cabinet spokesman and Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said.

“Secretary Pompeo will travel to Colombo to underscore the commitment of the United States to a partnership with a strong, sovereign Sri Lanka and to advance our common goals for a free and open Indo-Pacific region,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement last week.

The Chinese military has been flexing its muscles in the strategically vital Indo Pacific region and is also engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea (SCS) and the East China Sea (ECS).

India, U.S. ink strategic defence pact

Early this month, India, the U.S., Japan and Australia agreed to step up coordination in creating a free and open Indo-Pacific.

Mr. Pompeo’s visit to Lanka comes two weeks after a high-powered Chinese delegation led by ruling Communist Party Politburo member Yang Jiechi visited Colombo.

Just a day before Mr. Pompeo’s visit to Colombo, the Chinese Embassy in Colombo accused the U.S. of interfering in the relations between China and Sri Lanka.

“We are firmly opposed to the United States taking the opportunity of the State Secretary’s visit to sow and interfere in China-Sri Lanka relations and to coerce and bully Sri Lanka, the Embassy said in a statement on Monday.

It said that China and Sri Lanka have enough wisdom to handle relations with each other and do not need a third party to dictate.

The statement hoped that the U.S. will “correct the ugly practices of arbitrarily interfering in other countries’ domestic and foreign affairs.”

China is one of the biggest investors in various infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka. But there has been criticism, both locally and internationally, and growing concerns that China has lured Sri Lanka into a debt trap.

The previous Maithripala Sirisena government had entered into a 99-year lease with China in 2017 as a settlement of its debt by way of equity. Sri Lanka’s economy, especially the tourism sector, has been hit hard since last year - initially by the Easter Sunday attacks, which killed over 250 people and later by the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

The Reserve Bank of India in July this year signed necessary documents for extending a $400 million currency swap facility to Sri Lanka to boost the nation’s draining foreign exchange reserves due to the coronavirus pandemic. The currency swap arrangement will remain available till November 2022.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ffl0zt/article32575214.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-POMPEOUNITEDSTATESIRAQ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mike-pompeo-to-hold-talks-with-sri-lankan-leadership-during-two-day-colombo-visit/article32954346.ece

An 18-year-old of Chechen origin beheaded near Paris on October 16 a teacher who had shown caricatures of Muhammad in class.

A powerful association of clerics in the Iranian city of Qom also urged the government late Monday to condemn Mr. Macron for his remarks while calling on Islamic nations to impose political and economic sanctions on France.

22,2020/10/27,"Coronavirus | Air pollution linked with 15% COVID-19 deaths worldwide, finds study","The study, published in the journal Cardiovascular Research, is the first to estimate the proportion of deaths from the coronavirus that could be attributed to the exacerbating effects of air pollution for every country in the world

About 15 per cent of deaths worldwide from COVID-19 may be linked to long-term exposure to air pollution, according to a study published on Tuesday.

Researchers, including those from Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, Germany, found that in Europe the proportion of COVID-19 deaths linked to air pollution was about 19 per cent, in North America it was 17 per cent, and in East Asia about 27 per cent.

The study, published in the journal Cardiovascular Research, is the first to estimate the proportion of deaths from the coronavirus that could be attributed to the exacerbating effects of air pollution for every country in the world.

The team noted that these proportions are an estimate of the fraction of COVID-19 deaths that could be avoided if the population were exposed to lower counterfactual air pollution levels without fossil fuel-related and other anthropogenic -- caused by humans -- emissions.

Also read | Air pollution helps COVID transmission, finds study

This attributable fraction does not imply a direct cause-effect relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 mortality, the researchers said.

Instead it refers to relationships between two, direct and indirect, i.e. by aggravating co-morbidities, or other health conditions, that could lead to fatal health outcomes of the virus infection, they said.

The researchers used epidemiological data from previous US and Chinese studies of air pollution and COVID-19 and the SARS outbreak in 2003, supported by additional data from Italy.

They combined this with satellite data showing global exposure to polluting fine particles known as ‘particulate matter’ that are less than or equal to 2.5 microns in diameter (known as PM2.5), information on atmospheric conditions and ground-based pollution monitoring networks.

Also read | Air pollution now biggest health risk in India, says report

The researchers created a model to calculate the fraction of coronavirus deaths that could be attributable to long-term exposure to PM2.5.

The results are based on epidemiological data collected up to third week in June 2020 and the researchers say a comprehensive evaluation will need to follow after the pandemic has subsided.

Estimates for individual countries show, for example, that air pollution contributed to 29 per cent of coronavirus deaths in the Czech Republic, 27 per cent in China, 26 per cent in Germany, 22 per cent in Switzerland, and 21 per cent in Belgium.

“Since the numbers of deaths from COVID-19 are increasing all the time, it’s not possible to give exact or final numbers of COVID-19 deaths per country that can be attributed to air pollution,” said Professor Jos Lelieveld from Max Planck Institute for Chemistry.

“However, as an example, in the UK there have been over 44,000 coronavirus deaths and we estimate that the fraction attributable to air pollution is 14 per cent, meaning that more than 6,100 deaths could be attributed to air pollution,” Lelieveld said.

“In the US, more than 220,000 COVID deaths with a fraction of 18 per cent yields about 40,000 deaths attributable to air pollution,” he said.

Professor Thomas Munzel from the Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany noted that when people inhale polluted air, the very small polluting particles, the PM2.5, migrate from the lungs to the blood and blood vessels, causing inflammation and severe oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between free radicals and oxidants in the body that normally repair damage to cells.

“This causes damage to the inner lining of arteries, the endothelium, and leads to the narrowing and stiffening of the arteries. The COVID-19 virus also enters the body via the lungs, causing similar damage to blood vessels, and it is now considered to be an endothelial disease, Munzel said.

“If both long-term exposure to air pollution and infection with the COVID-19 virus come together then we have an additive adverse effect on health, particularly with respect to the heart and blood vessels, which leads to greater vulnerability and less resilience to COVID-19,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/5p6xym/article32922870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DelhiAirQualityjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/air-pollution-linked-with-15-covid-19-deaths-worldwide-finds-study/article32952577.ece

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has said his government has decided to strengthen relations with Afghanistan “no matter who is in power” in Kabul.

Mr. Khan said his government was making efforts to enhance connections with the business community of Afghanistan in order to benefit from each other’s experience and give impetus to trade and economic relations.

The Prime Minister said his government has decided to strengthen relations with Afghanistan “no matter who is in power” in the neighbouring country.

“Future of both countries is dependent upon their unity, mutual trade, and enhanced economic interlinks,” Mr. Khan said while highlighting the need to support Afghan traders and investors.

He said both the Muslim countries had vast potential for investment and economic activities, which would bring regional prosperity and development.

Both Afghanistan and Pakistan could benefit from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and become hubs of trade and business, he remarked.

Mr. Khan made it clear that the Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace process was the chief concern of his government and no other country in the world could take credit equal to Pakistan in its efforts to maintain peace in Afghanistan.

Speaker of Afghan Wolesi Jirga Mir Rahman Rahmani said Afghanistan valued Pakistan’s contributions to the Afghan peace process.

He said the relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan was deep-rooted in common culture, faith, and values. He also stressed the need for enhancing parliamentary contacts between the two countries.

While appreciating the steps taken by Pakistan to facilitate Afghan transit trade, which had reduced the time of shipment clearance on the border, Rahmani said opening new border points for trade would facilitate the trade further.

Pakistan’s Speaker National Assembly Asad Qaisar said that 2,640 kilometres Pak-Afghan border was not only the longest border that Pakistan shared with any of its neighbours, but it was also the thread that weaves the two nations into a historic tapestry of “social, cultural, linguistic, economic, religious and fraternal ties”.

He proposed the formation of a task force to oversee the terms of negotiation of Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA), which was going to expire next year and needed input from parliamentarians and institutional stakeholders from both sides of borders for a comprehensive future trade agreement.

The two-day seminar was organised by National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser at a time when trade and political relations between the neighbouring countries have improved lately.

Climate activists abseiled from bridges near Germany's financial hub Frankfurt on Monday in protest at the planned expansion of a motorway, causing backed-up traffic on busy roads during the morning rush hour.

The activists called for a stop to the clearing of part of the Dannenroeder forest, which they refer to as “Danni”, to make way for a highway. The felling of trees in the forest, which lies in a nature protection area north of Frankfurt, started this month and police removed activists from tree houses they had built in protest.

25,2020/10/27,"Bomb at seminary in Pakistan kills 8 students, wounds 136","According to police, more than 30 including two teachers have been injured in the explosion

A powerful bomb blast ripped through an Islamic seminary on the outskirts of Peshawar on Tuesday morning, killing at least eight students and wounding 136 others, police and a hospital spokesman said.

The bombing happened as a prominent religious scholar during a special class was delivering a lecture about the teachings of Islam at the main hall of the Jamia Zubairia madrassa, said police officer Waqar Azim. He said initial investigations suggest the bomb went off minutes after someone left a bag at the madrassa.

TV footage showed the damaged main hall of the seminary, where the bombing took place. The hall was littered with broken glass and its carpet was stained with blood. Police said at least 5 kilograms of explosives were used in the attack.

Several of the wounded students were in critical condition, and hospital authorities feared the death toll could climb further. Authorities said some seminary teachers and employees were also wounded in the bombing.

Initially police said the bombing killed and wounded children studying at the seminary but later revised their account to say that the students were in their mid-20s.

Shortly after the attack, residents rushed to the seminary to check up on their sons or relatives who were studying there. Many relatives were gathering at the city’s main Lady Reading Hospital, where the dead and wounded students were brought by police in ambulances and other vehicles.

Some Afghan students studying at the seminary were also among the wounded, officials said.

Imran Khan condemns bombing

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the bombing and asked authorities to ensure the provision of best possible medical aid to the victims.

""I want to assure my nation we will ensure the terrorists responsible for this cowardly barbaric attack are brought to justice,” Mr. Khan said.

The bombing drew condemnation from the country’s opposition party, which has been holding rallies meant to force Khan’s government to quit.

Mohammad Asim, a spokesman at the Lady Reading Hospital, said eight students died and they received dozens of wounded people, mostly seminary students.

The attack comes days after Pakistani intelligence alerted that militants could target public places and important buildings, including seminaries and mosques across Pakistan, including Peshawar.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in Peshawar which is the provincial capital of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan.

Muslims in the Middle East and beyond on Monday broadened their calls for boycotts of French products and protests, as a clash over depictions of the Prophet Muhammad and the limits of free speech intensified.

Kuwaiti stores pulled French yogurts and bottles of sparkling water from their shelves, Qatar University cancelled a French culture week, and calls to stay away from the Carrefour grocery store chain were trending on social media in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Protests have been held in Iraq, Turkey and the Gaza Strip, and Pakistan’s parliament passed a resolution condemning the publication of cartoons of the prophet.

Also read | Indian Muslim forum condemns beheading in Paris

The beheading earlier this month of a French teacher who had shown caricatures of the Prophet in class has once again ignited a debate over such depictions — which Muslims consider blasphemous. The growing confrontation is raising political tensions between France and some Muslim-majority nations, especially Turkey, and could put pressure on French companies. Other European countries have also entered the fray in support of France.

The teacher, who was killed by an 18-year-old Chechen refugee, has been heralded at home as a national symbol of France’s dearly held secular ideals and its rejection of any whiff of religious intrusion in public spheres.

We will not give in: Macron

French President Emmanuel Macron has vigorously defended such depictions as protected by the right to free speech. At a memorial for the teacher last week, Mr. Macron said: “We won’t renounce the caricatures.”

On Sunday, he appeared to double down. In tweets published in both Arabic and English, he wrote: “We will not give in, ever.” He added, however, that France does not accept hate speech and respects all differences.

Mr. Macron’s stance has drawn anger from both everyday people and some political leaders in the Muslim world.

On Twitter, some criticised what they said is France’s hypocrisy and bias against Muslims. One cartoon widely shared put forth the argument that caricatures of Muslims are defended in “The West” as fair game under freedom of speech protections, while caricatures of Jews are labelled hate speech.

Egypt’s top cleric, Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, who is also the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, Sunni Islam’s highest seat of learning, also accused those who “justify insulting the prophet of Islam” of hypocrisy.

In France, a law aimed at addressing the country’s role during Nazi occupation specifically mentions that anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial are crimes, but it can also be used to prosecute anti-Muslim discrimination - or hate speech, in general.

Erdogan criticises Macron

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been the most vociferous in his criticism among political leaders, saying Mr. Macron needed his head examined and had lost his way. France responded by recalling its ambassador to Turkey. On Monday, Erdogan also called on Turks not to purchase French goods.

Both Jordan and Pakistan have summoned the French ambassador in their countries to express their displeasure. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan accused the French leader chose to encourage anti-Muslim sentiment.

Muslims debate

The dispute is also creating debate within the Muslim world. Diana Moukalled, a Lebanese writer and co-editor of the independent Daraj news site, criticised how some people appear to be more offended by the cartoons than by the beheading of the French teacher.

Muslim scholars have condemned the caricatures, but some also sought to curb swelling anger.

Saudi Arabia’s senior council of clerics issued a statement saying that defamation of the Prophet Muhammad only serves extremists who want to spread hatred. While denouncing insults against Islam, the clerics also cited the prophet’s “mercy, justice, tolerance” in their statement.

The head of the Saudi-based Muslim World League, Sheikh Mohammed al-Issa, told a Saudi news channel that while the caricatures are insulting, the prophet’s influence and status are greater than any impact from such drawings. He said Muslims should not overreact.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/stores-in-muslim-majority-nations-boycott-french-goods-to-protest-caricatures/article32950320.ece
27,2020/10/27,U.S. announces planned $2.37 billion weapon sale to Taiwan,"The announcement comes just hours after Beijing announced sanctions on U.S. defense contractors

The Trump administration on Monday notified Congress of plans for a $2.37 billion sale of Harpoon missile systems to Taiwan just hours after Beijing announced sanctions on U.S. defense contractors, including Boeing, the lead contractor on the Harpoon deal.

""The United States maintains an abiding interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and considers the security of Taiwan central to the security and stability of the broader Indo-Pacific region,” the State Department said. It said the sale would not alter the military balance in the region.

Earlier Monday, China said it was imposing sanctions on Boeing, Lockheed Martin and other U.S. defense firms for providing weapons to Taiwan.

The ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan, which split with the mainland in 1949 during a civil war, as part of its territory and has threatened to invade. Washington promised in the 1980s to reduce and eventually end weapons sales to Taiwan but insists its dispute with Beijing must be settled peacefully.

A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, gave no details on what penalties might be imposed or when.

""In order to safeguard national interests, China decided to impose sanctions on the American companies that were involved in arms sales to Taiwan,” Zhao said.

Chinese-U.S. relations have plunged to their lowest level in decades amid disputes about security, technology, the coronavirus pandemic and human rights.

Taiwan has long been an irritant in relations. Washington has no formal relations with the island’s democratically elected government but is its main ally. U.S. law requires the government to ensure Taiwan can defend itself. Weapons sales to the island have increased in quantity and quality.

Beijing regularly pressures American companies including Boeing in an effort to influence U.S. policy. China is one of Boeing’s biggest markets for commercial aircraft, which might make it vulnerable to a boycott, but Zhao mentioned only Boeing’s military arm, Boeing Defense, not its civilian jetliner business.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ng8deh/article32949657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDTAIWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-announces-planned-237-billion-weapon-sale-to-taiwan/article32949647.ece
28,2020/10/27,Malaysia's PM Muhyiddin gets reprieve from key ally in political crisis,"Mr. Muhyiddin, who has a razor thin majority in Parliament, is under pressure from unhappy coalition partners who have demanded more powerful positions

The largest party in Malaysia's ruling coalition declared its support for Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, providing some respite for the premier who has faced calls to resign after a failed bid to impose a state of emergency.

Mr. Muhyiddin, who has a razor thin majority in Parliament, is under pressure from unhappy coalition partners who have demanded more powerful positions amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases and a pandemic-battered economy.

Calls for him to resign grew after the king on Sunday rejected his request for him to declare emergency rule amid a leadership challenge. Critics have accused the premier of using the pandemic as a pretext to suspend parliament and avoid a test of his majority.

The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party, which had earlier this month threatened to withdraw support for Mr. Muhyiddin, said it will now back him as the time has come for national reconciliation between political parties to ensure political stability and to focus efforts on managing the pandemic.

UMNO also said it will not work with opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's party, rejecting a proposal by former Malaysian premier and now-ruling party lawmaker Najib Razak.

Last month, Mr. Anwar declared that he had secured majority support from federal lawmakers to form a new government, sparking the political crisis.

In a Monday meeting of the former ruling Barisan Nasional coalition led by UMNO, Najib asked lawmakers in the alliance to endorse Anwar, three sources familiar with the matter said.

Najib's backing of Anwar marks a striking turnaround in their relationship. Anwar was one of the key leaders in a coalition that defeated Najib in a historic election in 2018.

Muhyiddin has maintained a tenuous alliance with UMNO, whose backing was key in his bid to secure the premiership in March after a bout of political wrangling led to the collapse of the administration led by veteran politician Mahathir Mohamad.

Leaders in UMNO, which had led the country for over 60 years until its defeat in a 2018 election, have balked at playing second fiddle to Muhyiddin's party. Some of UMNO's corruption-tainted leaders, including Najib, have been trying to revive their political fortunes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/q9mywt/article32949634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDMALAYSIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malaysias-pm-muhyiddin-gets-reprieve-from-key-ally-in-political-crisis/article32949635.ece
29,2020/10/27,U.S. says airstrike killed 7 leaders of al-Qaida in Syria,"This will disrupt the terrorist organisation’s ability to further plot and carryout global attacks, says official

The United States believes it killed seven senior leaders of al-Qaida in Syria in an airstrike last week as the leaders were meeting near Idlib, U.S. Central Command said Monday.

A Central Command spokeswoman, Maj. Beth Riordan, said the strike was conducted Oct. 22. She did not identify the seven leaders by name.

The removal of these AQ-S leaders will disrupt the terrorist organisation’s ability to further plot and carryout global attacks threatening U.S. citizens, our partners, and innocent civilians, she said.

AQ-S takes advantage of the instability in northwest Syria to establish and maintain safe havens to coordinate terrorist activities, she added.

“With our allies and partners, we will continue to target al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations.

30,2020/10/27,Senate votes to confirm Amy Barrett to U.S. Supreme Court,"President Trump’s choice to fill the vacancy of the late liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg potentially gives the top court a 6-3 conservative majority for decades

With just a week to go until Election Day, Senate Republicans pushed through the confirmation of Trump Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett, potentially giving the Supreme Court a 6-3 conservative majority for decades.

The Senate voted 52-48 to confirm the 48-year-old judge – with GOP Senator from Maine, Susan Collins, joining Democrats to vote against the nomination. Ms. Collins faces a tight election in Maine against Indian American candidate and Maine House Speaker Sara Gidoen.

The Hindu Explains | Why are Democrats and Republicans squabbling over nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court?

Ms. Barrett, who was nominated to replace liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, will be the first mother of school-aged children and the fifth ever woman appointed to the Court. With her appointment, six of the nine judges of the Supreme Court will be Catholic.

Democrats campaigned publicly against the nomination – saying it was hypocritical for Senate Republicans, who had blocked Merrick Garland, a Barack Obama nominee from the former President’s last year in office, to go through with Ms. Barrett’s confirmation with an election underway. Some sixty million Americans have already cast their ballots.

Ms. Barrett’s potential positions on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), immigration, abortion rights, climate change, gay rights and how she may rule on any election related cases in the event that a narrow victory or loss is litigated could impact the country for decades to come.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s eleventh hour nomination had become a campaign talking point for both parties. During and before her confirmation hearing, Democrats warned that Americans’ health insurance could be in jeopardy during a raging pandemic if Ms. Barrett’s appointment went through. The Court is scheduled to hear a challenge to the ACA in November.

During her confirmation hearing, Judge Barrett had declined to say whether she would recuse herself from the ACA case or any election-related cases. On the elections, she said she would not allow herself “to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.”

When asked by Democratic Vice-Presidential candidate Kamala Harris whether climate change was “happening “ and “threatening the air we breathe and the water we drink,” Ms. Barrett declined to answer, saying the issue was “very contentious” and a matter of public debate.

A gathering Mr. Trump had hosted to announce Ms. Barrett’s nomination at the end of September is thought to have been a “super-spreader event” — one that resulted in a number of attendees, including Mr. Trump, getting infected with the coronavirus. At Ms. Barrett’s confirmation ceremony on Monday night at the White House, officials decided to follow social distancing norms: chairs were spread out and most attendees wore masks.

“The Barrett family has captured America’s heart. It is highly fitting that Justice Barrett fills the sea of a true pioneer for women, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,” Mr. Trump said with a smiling Barrett at his side.

With Ms. Barrett’s appointment to the Court, Democrats are expected to consider term limits for Supreme Court justices as well as increasing the number of justices in the court.

“My Senate Republican colleagues have just done great harm to the American people by confirming Judge Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. There is no question about that,” said Ms. Harris, who had paused her campaigning to return to Washington for the Senate vote.

Amy Coney Barrett has taken the first of two oaths she needs to officially join the Supreme Court.

Chief Justice John Roberts is set to administer a second oath — known as the judicial oath — to the former federal appeals court judge at a private ceremony at the court on Tuesday.

31,2020/10/27,Wave of new COVID-19 cases crashes across U.S. and Europe as winter looms,"U.S. stocks had their worst day in four weeks over the double whammy of record coronavirus cases and political deadlock in negotiations to provide more economic aid.

The United States, Russia, France and many other countries are setting records for coronavirus infections as a tidal wave of cases washes over parts of the Northern Hemisphere, forcing some countries to impose new curbs.

The gloom weighed on global financial markets on Monday as surging infections clouded the economic outlook.

U.S. stocks had their worst day in four weeks over the double whammy of record coronavirus cases and political deadlock in negotiations to provide more economic aid.

Word that a vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc produced immune responses in both elderly and young people offered some positive news as autumn turns to winter in northern countries and more people socialise indoors.

But British Health Secretary Matt Hancock cautioned that the vaccine would not be widely available until next year and said, ”We’re not there yet”.

Any vaccine faces both scientific and public relations hurdles. Surveys have shown only about half of Americans would get a COVID-19 vaccination due to concerns about safety, effectiveness and the approval process.

In the United States, the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is at a two-month high, straining health care systems in some states.

U.S. President Donald Trump, facing a tough re-election battle on Nov. 3, lashed out again at reports that the coronavirus is surging.

He repeated his unfounded claim that COVID-19 cases are rising because there is more testing, an assertion not supported by data and one that has been rejected by health experts.

“Cases up because we TEST, TEST, TEST. A Fake News Media Conspiracy. Many young people who heal very fast. 99.9%. Corrupt Media conspiracy at all time high,” Trump said in a Twitter post.

The number of new COVID-19 cases in the United States last week rose 24% while the number of tests performed rose 5.5%, according to a Reuters analysis.

‘Lockdown light’

In Europe the picture was unrelentingly grim as a string of countries reported record increases, led by France, which posted more than 50,000 daily cases for the first time on Sunday, while the continent passed the threshold of 250,000 deaths.

France may even be experiencing 100,000 new infections a day, professor Jean-Franśois Delfraissy, who heads a council that advises the government, told RTL radio.

Governments have been desperate to avoid the lockdowns which curbed the disease earlier in the year at the cost of shutting down their entire economies. But the steady rise in new cases has forced many in Europe to tighten curbs.

“We are facing very, very difficult months ahead,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a meeting of leaders from her Christian Democrat party, according to daily Bild.

She plans “lockdown light” that will focus on closing bars, restaurants and public events, the newspaper said.

The Spanish government faced a backlash over its plans to put one of Europe’s worst COVID-19 hot spots under a six-month state of emergency. Opposition parties said six months was too long, epidemiologists said this may be too little too late and some citizens balked at nightly curfews.

Russia’s daily tally of new COVID-19 infections surged to a record high of 17,347 on Monday as the Kremlin warned the pandemic was beginning to take a greater toll outside Moscow.

Russia in August became the first country to grant regulatory approval for a vaccine against COVID-19 after less than two months of human testing, raising eyebrows among sceptical scientists in the West. Regulators approved a second vaccine earlier this month.

With 1.5 million infections, the country of around 145 million people has recorded the world’s fourth largest COVID-19 case load - after the United States, India and Brazil.

Italy, the country worst hit in the early stages of the crisis in March, imposed new restrictions, ordering restaurants and bars to close from 6 p.m., shutting cinemas and gyms and imposing local curfews in several regions.

More than 43 million people are reported to have been infected by the coronavirus globally and 1.15 million have died, according to a Reuters tally. The United States has the highest number of deaths and infections.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4s4903/article32949279.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SPAIN-VIRUS-HEALTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wave-of-new-covid-19-cases-crashes-across-us-and-europe-as-winter-looms/article32949280.ece
32,2020/10/27,"U.S. Presidential Elections | Trump, Biden make their pitches to voters in pivotal Pennsylvania","“We win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,” the Republican president told cheering supporters in Allentown as he predicted a win there despite trailing Mr. Biden in many opinion polls.

With eight days to go until the U.S. election, President Donald Trump addressed boisterous rallies in Pennsylvania while Democratic rival Joe Biden made a low-key appearance in the state considered crucial to the chances of victory for both men.

“We win Pennsylvania, we win the whole thing,” the Republican president told cheering supporters in Allentown - the first of three stops in the state - as he predicted a win there despite trailing Mr. Biden in many opinion polls.

Mr. Biden made a small-scale appearance in the city of Chester, near Philadelphia, meeting with about a dozen campaign volunteers and speaking with reporters. Mr. Biden said he was “not overconfident about anything” and “with the grace of God” he would win Pennsylvania, the state where he was born.

“I think we're going to win Michigan, I think we're going to win Wisconsin. I think we're going to win Minnesota. I think have a fighting chance in Ohio. I think we have a fighting chance in North Carolina. We have a fighting chance in Georgia,” Mr. Biden added, referring to other election battleground states.

Mr. Biden also stepped up his criticism of Mr. Trump's handling of a coronavirus pandemic that has killed roughly 225,000 Americans, saying, “The bottom line is, Donald Trump is the worst possible president, the worst possible person to lead us through this pandemic.”

More than 60 million Americans already have cast ballots ahead of the Nov. 3 election, a record-breaking pace that could lead to the highest U.S. voter turnout by percentage in more than a century.

Surging coronavirus cases in many parts of the country have dominated the campaign, along with news of a COVID-19 outbreak within Vice President Mike Pence's staff. Pence, due in Minnesota, tested negative for the coronavirus on Monday, his office said, after multiple senior aides tested positive over the weekend.

Despite Mr. Biden's solid lead in national opinion polls, the contest appears tighter in the most critical battleground states that could decide the outcome. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from Oct. 20-26 gave Mr. Biden a narrow advantage over Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania.

A state where voters can swing toward either major party, Pennsylvania has been heavily courted with frequent visits by both candidates. Mr. Trump went from Allentown to Lititz and then was due to head to Martinsburg. Mr. Trump also planned multiple stops in Michigan and Wisconsin this week, as well as visits to Arizona, Nebraska and Nevada.

Mr. Trump told reporters he expects to win Pennsylvania by a larger margin than the narrow one he achieved in defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Addressing supporters, Mr. Trump touched on what he called “an existential” issue for Pennsylvania, Mr. Biden's comment during last week's presidential debate that if elected he would “transition” the United States away from oil and natural gas.

“He wants to go with windmills that are made in Germany and China,” Mr. Trump said, adding, “Biden's plan is an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania's energy sector.”

In Chester, Mr. Biden defended his stance, saying, “I'm not shutting down oil fields. I'm not eliminating fracking. I'm investing in clean energy.” Mr. Biden previously said the country should eventually replace oil with solar, wind and other forms of non-polluting power, adding that his plan for a more climate-friendly economy would create high-paying jobs and boost U.S. businesses.

Pandemic politics

Record numbers of new U.S. COVID-19 cases in recent days have offered Mr. Biden's campaign a chance to remind voters of how Mr. Trump and his allies have played down the advice of public health experts to wear masks and observe social-distancing guidelines to battle the pandemic.

Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Biden on Monday, calling him “a pathetic candidate” while again asserting that his administration was ”doing a great job” against the pandemic and saying again that the United States was “absolutely rounding the corner.”

Mr. Biden again denounced White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows' comments on Sunday that the Trump administration was ”not going to control the pandemic,” and was instead focused on vaccines and therapeutics. Mr. Trump earlier on Monday disagreed with Meadows, saying “absolutely the opposite” was true.

Pence spoke at a campaign event in Hibbing, Minnesota. Police confirmed that there were more than 650 people in attendance, exceeding Minnesota state health guidelines to restrict crowds to 250 people amid the pandemic. Pence has headed the White House coronavirus task force.

Mr. Trump in Lititz, Pennsylvania, criticized international trade entities and complained about economic powerhouse China's status as a developing nation under World Trade Organization rules. “We want to be a developing nation also,” Mr. Trump said.

Mr. Trump also won cheers from supporters when he touted his nomination of conservative appellate judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court “to defend our God-given freedoms.”

The Republican-led Senate was expected to confirm Barrett to the lifetime job later in the day.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/aqf9vx/article32949082.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-DONALD-TRUMP-HOLDS-MULTIPLE-CAMPAIGN-RALLIES-ACROSS-PENNSYLVA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-elections-trump-biden-make-their-pitches-to-voters-in-pivotal-pennsylvania/article32949083.ece
33,2020/10/27,Bihar Assembly elections | The end of social justice politics in Bihar,"2020 marks the end of an era in the State’s politics

This year’s Assembly election in Bihar is the first in three decades in which Lalu Prasad Yadav (72) is not the central character — he is in jail and ill. Ramvilas Paswan died in the midst of the election, at 74. Nitish Kumar (69), incumbent Chief Minister, is fighting hard to slow down this terminal political decline. This is his last battle, win or lose. The three, all products of the Jayaprakash Narayan movement in the 1970s, pursued various versions of social justice politics.

Bihar has been an epicentre of Indian politics for at least a century. The State significantly shaped the course of India in the last 30 years, in the cross currents of forces unleashed by ‘Mandal, Mandir and Market’. 2020 marks the end of that era in Bihar; what new beginning this end portends is not entirely clear.

The era in question began exactly 30 years ago, on October 23, 1990, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader L.K. Advani’s Ram Rath Yatra was stopped in Samastipur by Mr. Yadav, who was the then chief minister. The arrest of Mr. Advani brought to the forefront the conflict between the goals of social justice and Hindutva, until then concealed by the shared anti-Congressism of their proponents. Social justice politicians experimented with various coalitions at the Centre. Beyond opportunism, these divergent routes also signified different approaches to social justice.

Mr. Yadav never allied with the BJP and remained the most consistent, steadfast critic of Hindutva. He built a social coalition of OBCs (Other Backward Class), Dalits and Muslims that survived for 15 years, until 2005. He combined wit, empathy and an uncompromising opposition to communalism. He spoke about religious harmony, U.S. foreign policy and India’s nuclear policy in a manner that made them all legible to the rural voters of the State. He critiqued the developmentalism of state and market, from the subaltern perspective with regard to equity and representation. The rise of subaltern politics under his leadership was resisted by the upper castes. Political violence, crime and corruption on his watch shrunk his legitimacy and he ended up in jail, convicted on corruption charges. His social coalition crumbled as Dalits and the Extremely Backward Caste (EBC) groups rebelled against the Yadav preeminence in it.

Paswan pursued a narrow strand of social justice politics, with no ideological exploration or grassroots mobilisation. He fashioned himself as a Dalit leader, but keeping himself in power became the sole marker of Dalit empowerment for him. His way of demonstrating secularism was to have a bearded Muslim cleric on his campaign trail. His politics spoofed social justice and secularism.

Mr. Kumar broke from Mr. Yadav in 1994, and rose as an alternative to his model of social justice. He pitched himself as the Mandalite for the market era. Bihar’s engagement with the market did not come through rising investments or urbanisation within the State, but through the export of workers to urban centres in the west and south, new centres of growth after liberalisation. A marginal increase in disposable incomes, rising media consumption, and a new religiosity characterised Bihar’s highly mobile youths, opening the space for a new model of politics.

The EBCs and Maha Dalits who were left out of Mr. Yadav and Paswan’s politics, found a new hope in Mr. Kumar, who specifically addressed their concerns regarding representation in jobs and politics. He also spoke the language of market-friendly developmentalism. In alliance with the BJP that brought the upper caste votes, Mr. Kumar toppled the Yadav model in 2005. His ties with the BJP remained unsure all the time. In 2015, he joined hands with Mr. Yadav to win his third term, and returned to the BJP’s embrace in 2017 — tamed and humbled. Mr. Kumar’s claims of governance and social justice now sounds far-fetched in the aftermath of the pandemic. At least 23 lakh migrant workers returned to the State during lockdown, a large number of them walking thousands of kilometres. Unemployment has become the most resonating topic in Bihar in this election, against the backdrop of the ravaging pandemic. His hope of re-election is that his critics may not resent him enough to vote for his key opponent.

Mr. Yadav fades into history as a figure who fought hard on questions of secularism and social justice, inadequate as he surely has been. His son Tejashwi Yadav is trying to restore the social coalition that he had built and lost — a tough, lonely test for the 30-year old. His father’s legacy is more of a burden, and is not mentioned in the campaign. Paswan’s son Chirag Paswan, 37, is advancing apolitical politics to new heights. Mr. Kumar is fighting with his back to the wall. He is the prime target of all others, including his ally, the BJP.

The BJP’s rise to prominence in its strongholds has followed the pattern of first riding piggyback with allies who are then swallowed up or discarded. That inevitability is closing in on Mr. Kumar. The BJP has its own version of social justice — accommodation of lower caste aspiration within its fold, and antagonism toward Muslims. Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi, another contemporary of the social justice trio, is a Backward face of Hindutva, and there are several others who have risen in recent years. The BJP will hold its place and grow, but there is an evolving emptiness in the rest of the field in Bihar politics. Social justice politics as we knew it comes to an end with this election. It is an yearning that has lost its language. What will be its new language and who will speak it remain open questions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/ep6f1z/article32956603.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28TH-NIT,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-elections-the-end-of-social-justice-politics-in-bihar/article32956604.ece

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar fired another salvo at RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, though without naming him, saying no development can be expected from people producing 8-9 kids for a son, inviting a strong retort from Tejashwi Yadav who said the JD(U) boss is tired — both mentally and physically. Mr. Kumar used the slur at an election meeting at Mahnar in Vaishali district Monday.

“Kisi ko chinta hain. 8-9 bachha paida karte hain. Beti par bharosa nahi hai. 7-8 beti ho jane ke bad ladka hua. Kaisa Bihar Banana chahte hain...agar logo ka yahi aadarsh hain to Bihar ka kya hoga.”

“Does anybody care? They produce 8-9 kids. They have no faith on daughters. They had 7-8 daughters before a son. What kind of Bihar they want to make? If this is their ideal, what will happen to Bihar? Mr. Kumar said, without naming anybody but his obvious target was RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi, who have nine children.

Reacting to Mr. Kumar’s statement, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav told reporters in Patna Tuesday that by making such comments Mr. Kumar is targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has 5-6 brothers and sisters.

Mr. Yadav further said he takes Mr. Kumar’s “abuses” too as “blessings”.

He said the Chief Minister’s remark was an affront to the dignity of his mother as well as to other women’s.

He is tired — both physically and mentally. And hence he is making such remarks, Mr. Yadav said.

In the same Mahnar election meeting, Mr. Kumar explained to people as to why he left the Grand Alliance in 2017 just two years after forming a government with the RJD and Congress in 2015.

“I told him (Tejashwi) to come clean on a charge levelled against him in a money laundering case. He could not. Soon, I realised they have returned to their old habits of influencing even police stations and so I thought it’s difficult to work with them and walked out of the alliance,” Mr. Kumar said.

He had dumped the grand alliance in July 2017, barely two years after forming government of the opposition coalition in Bihar in 2015. Soon, he joined hands with the BJP and led the NDA ministry in the state since then.

Mr. Kumar also slammed the RJD for “humiliating” its founding member Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, allegedly forcing him to quit the party before his death last month.

“Raghuvansh babu was with them since the beginning in 1990 but how they treated him. These people are bothered only about their wife, sons and daughters,” Mr. Kumar said, attacking Mr. Prasad, who is lodged in a jail in Ranchi after conviction in four cases of fodder scam.

Raghuvansh Prasad Singh’s son Satya Prakash Singh, who has joined the JD(U) since his father’s death, also hit out at Prasad’s family for “mistreating my father in his last days.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/6w864l/article32936607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Nitish-Tejaswi,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-elections-nitish-kumar-fires-8-9-kids-jibe-tejashwi-retorts-with-mentally-tired-barb/article32954313.ece
35,2020/10/27,"Bihar Assembly elections | Jungle Raj, Babu Raj and now what, ask voters","Voters say ‘jungle raj’ replaced by ‘babu raj’ (bureaucrats’ rule) and muscle power replaced by money power

A common refrain in the northern belt of Bihar is the lack of ‘vikalp’ or option the voter is looking for a change but does not know where to go. People say the ‘jungle raj’ has been replaced by a ‘babu raj’ (bureaucrats’ rule), and muscle power replaced by money power.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and BJP leaders talk about development. But voters say this development is coming at a cost. Umesh Mandal, a daily wager in the Rupauli constituency of Purnia district, sums up, “Road ka badmash salta gaya. Block main badmash ko la kar baitha diya.

Corruption is a common theme in this election and perhaps the only recent parallel of such a sharp discourse against bribery was in the 2014 general election against the Congress-led UPA government. People complain about being forced to pay “cuts” for every little work, from getting their pension to government entitlements such as the Indira Awas Yojana, where the government gives funds to construct a pucca or brick house.

“If you want a house under the Indira Awas Yojana, then you have to pay ₹ 30,000 in bribes. For toilets, under the Swachch Bharat Mission, you have to shell out ₹ 2000. There is some error in my voter ID card. To get that corrected, I have to pay ₹ 200,” says an exasperated Kedarnath Mahant, who is from the Tanti community, an extremely backward caste.

Bihar Assembly Elections | When politics is an end in itself

List is long and urgent

People point out how roads last only a season, prohibition that is only on paper, about vapour street lamps that were promised but not delivered, about schools that have buildings but no teachers, about graduates who are lazying around the village without any viable employment. The list is long and urgent. Equally strong is the refrain for a change and the lament that there is no option.

“Nitish hamari mazboori hai, option hi kya hai,” Mijesh Kumar from Damadaha Dakshin says. He is clear: his choice in Narendra Modi, and the vote for the NDA is a vote for Mr. Modi. Mr. Kumar and his friends, all sitting around a machan, rue about unemployment. “If there were factories here, why would anyone go to Punjab,” says Ravikant Thakur, who belongs to the Nai community. But ask them about RJD’s chief minister contender Tejashwi Yadav’s poll promise of 10 lakh jobs, Mr. Thakur observes that he can’t be their choice. “We want Modi, so we have to vote for Nitish”.

Subash Shah, who runs a small roadside stall about 30 km away from Purnia town, points at the road ahead with its top layer missing with just stones and gravel and vehicles plying on it rhythmically jingle jangle. “Vote dena padega Modi ko hi, Lalu ko dete hai toh laaltain bujh jaayega,” [will have to vote for Modi, if we vote for Lalu, then the hurricane lamp will be doused], he says.

Miles away at the Banmakhi constituency, Vijay Kumar, who belongs to the Mallah community, says he is voting for Mr. Modi and not for Mr. Nitish Kumar. “We don’t want Nitish as our chief minister,” he asserts. There is no cogent explanation as to why he wants Mr. Kumar replaced except that he has been at the helm for 15 years.

Memories of Lalu-Rabri regime

And memories and stories of the 15-year Lalu-Rabri regime are still alive, at least in the minds of some. At Forbesganj, in Araria district, a lively debate ensues on Mr. Nitish Kumar vs Mr. Lalu Prasad. Vishnu Dev Yadav, a daily wager, speaks nostalgically about how Mr. Prasad gave them the social recognition, ensuring that they can sit across a forward caste person on a chair instead of being told to sit on the ground. Chandra Mandal a kurmi, snaps back, “Have you forgotten how the police used to snatch money from us. Any one with a gun was a raja back then,” he notes.

And it is not just Mr. Nitish Kumar’s loyal vote bank of kurmis and koeries, he has a few rare votaries among older Muslims too.

At the Korha assembly constituency, in Katihar district, Shahbuddin, who is in his early 40s and runs a vehicle repair shop gets, into a spat with 19-year-old first-time voter Mohammad Tariq, who is training to be an electrician. “No other government has done as much as the Nitish government has done. He got us roads, electricity... ” Mr. Shahbuddin says. ‘These are no favours’, Mr. Tariq interjects. “Road, water, electricity are our basic rights. By providing these, no government is doing us a favour,” he points out.

And Mr. Tariq is in no mood to buy the ‘jungle raj’ narrative. That was 15 years back, he says. Now things have changed. “My father is a farmer and I am studying in ITI. Father and son do not have to be alike,” he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/1obyqi/article32953029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EVMS,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-election-voters-complain-of-lack-of-option/article32952909.ece
36,2020/10/27,Bihar Assembly elections | NGO moves SC against electoral bonds scheme,"The court had denied a stay on a similar plea moved by the NGO ahead of the Delhi elections earlier this year.

Ahead of Bihar Assembly elections, an NGO has moved the Supreme Court seeking urgent hearing of its 2017 PIL challenging the 2018 Electoral Bonds Scheme meant for funding political parties.

The NGO, ‘Association for Democratic Reforms’, had earlier also moved a similar plea seeking a stay on the scheme ahead of Delhi Assembly polls in January this year. The Supreme Court had refused to grant the interim stay on the scheme.

The Supreme Court, however, had sought responses from the Centre and the Election Commission within two weeks on the interim application filed by the NGO on January 20 and since then the PIL has not been listed for hearing.

The three-phase elections in Bihar will be held from October 28 to November 7 amid the COVID-19 pandemic; the counting of votes will be on November, 10.

Right before the Bihar legislative Assembly elections, the State Bank of India, in the XIV Phase of sale, has been authorised to issue and encash Electoral Bonds through its 29 authorised branches with effect from October 19 to October 28, 2020, said the fresh plea, filed through lawyer Prashant Bhushan.

Seeking urgent hearing, it said even though a notification of January 2, 2018, stipulated the sale of electoral bonds in months of January, April, July and October months of each year and the window was not opened in April and July, but has been opened in October, (this year) right before the Bihar legislative election.

It said in view of passing of more than 9 months since the last date of hearing of the PIL and new developments relating to Bihar legislative election having taken place, the instant plea required an urgent hearing.

As the reason for urgency, the NGO said that it had filed the PIL on September 4, 2017 on the issue of corruption and subversion of democracy through illicit and foreign funding of political parties and lack of transparency in the accounts of all political parties.

Certain amendments made through Finance Act, 2017 and earlier Finance Act, 2016, both passed as money bills, and which have opened doors to unlimited political donations, even from foreign companies and thereby legitimising electoral corruption at a huge scale, while at the same time ensuring complete non-transparency in political funding, it said.

The scheme has opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate donations to political parties and anonymous financing by Indian as well as foreign companies which can have serious repercussions on the Indian democracy, it said.

The Finance Act of 2017 has introduced the use of electoral bonds which is exempt from disclosure under the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951, opening doors to unchecked, unknown funding to political parties, it said.

The amendments to the law have removed the existing cap of 7.5% of net profit in the last 3 years on campaign donations by companies and have legalised anonymous donations, it said.

Earlier, the Supreme Court had refused to grant interim stay on the 2018 Electoral Bonds Scheme ahead of Delhi Assembly polls.

The poll panel filed its reply in February and had told the Supreme Court that it has received status of filing of electoral bonds from various political parties, including the BJP and the Congress, in a sealed cover.

The EC had filed the affidavit in pursuance to the Supreme Court’s direction asking the political parties to furnish all details of funds received through electoral bonds to the poll panel in a sealed cover.

The government had notified the Electoral Bond Scheme on January 2, 2018.

As per provisions of the scheme, electoral bonds may be purchased by a person, who is a citizen of India or incorporated or established in India.

An individual can buy electoral bonds, either singly or jointly with other individuals.

Only political parties registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and which secured not less than 1% of votes polled in the last general election to the House of the People or the Legislative Assembly of the State, are eligible to receive electoral bonds.

As per the notification, electoral bonds shall be encashed by an eligible political party only through a bank account with an authorised bank.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6yjh4z/article32883893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10SC,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/bihar-assembly-elections-ngo-moves-supreme-court-against-electoral-bonds-scheme/article32952679.ece
37,2020/10/27,Bihar Assembly elections | Voting in first phase for 71 seats on October 28,"It will be a close contest between the BJP-led NDA and the RJD-led mahagathbandhan

Voting in the first phase of the Bihar Assembly elections for 71 seats across 16 districts will be held on October 28.

Also read: Bihar Assembly elections | The end of social justice politics in Bihar

It will be a close contest between the BJP-led NDA and the RJD-led mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) despite issues of corruption at lower levels of bureaucracy and prohibition plaguing the incumbent government, while the Opposition led by Tejashwi Yadav is getting “advantage by default” and narrowing the gap.

Bihar is the first State going to the polls amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Election Commission has issued several guidelines for the voters and those engaged in conducting the poll.

In the first phase, the RJD is contesting in 42 seats and alliance partner Congress in 21 seats. Similarly, the ruling NDA alliance JD(U) candidates are in the fray in 41 seats, the BJP in 29 and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) in 41 seats. The LJP is not part of the NDA in Bihar as it has fielded party candidates in 143 seats, mainly to contest against JD(U) nominees. Altogether, 1,066 candidates are in the fray in the first phase of elections, of whom 114 are women.

The electoral fate of over half-a-dozen ministers of the Nitish Kumar Cabinet, such as Krishnandan Verma, Jai Kumar Singh, Santosh Kumar Nirala, Vijay Kumar Sinha, Prem Kumar, Shailesh Kumar, Brij Kishore Bind and Ram Narayan Mandal, will be decided in the first phase in districts such as Maoist-affected Gaya, Rohtas and Aurangabad.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several other top BJP leaders have addressed a number of public meetings, while Congress leader Rahul Gandhi too addressed two in Nawada and Bhagalpur.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav have also addressed several meetings. Mr. Modi and Mr. Gandhi are also scheduled to address public meetings in Bihar on Wednesday.

Tejashwi factor

For mahagathbandhan, Mr. Tejashwi Yadav is the main campaign star in whose public meetings a large number of youths have turned out. The young leader has promised 10 lakh jobs to youth of the State with his first signature in first Cabinet meeting if voted to power.

“Seemingly, he (Tejashwi Yadav) is getting an advantage by default due to likely support of anti-Nitish Kumar votes. He is attracting huge gatherings at his public meetings, mostly the negative votes”, said political analyst Ajay Kumar.

Similarly, CPI star campaigner Kanhaiya Kumar too is getting an encouraging response from crowds at his public meetings largely confined to Begusarai district.

On the other side, Mr. Nitish Kumar is facing a huge anti-incumbency feeling and has been seen losing his cool at times during public meetings. The 69-year-old veteran has faced strong protests and pro-Lalu Prasad slogans at his public meetings. He is seeking a fourth consecutive term in power and Mr. Tejashwi Yadav has highlighted in his public meetings that Mr. Nitish Kumar has now become a “tired” person “who is not able to govern”.

Meanwhile, prominent BJP leaders like Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, poll in-charge Devendra Fadnavis and former Union Ministers Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Shahnawaj Hussain have fallen prey to COVID-19 while campaigning.

The second and third phases of the poll will be held on November 3 and 7.

38,2020/10/27,"Vote for change, build a ‘new Bihar’, Sonia Gandhi appeals to electors","Ms. Gandhi called upon people of State to build a “new Bihar”

Accusing the Nitish Kumar government of being steeped in ‘arrogance and ego’, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday appealed to the electors to vote for ‘mahagathbandhan’ (grand alliance) and build a ‘new Bihar’.

She issued a video appeal ahead of the first phase of Assembly election on October 28 and asked people to vote against the government whose “actions and intentions are questionable”.

Bihar Assembly election: Phase I campaign ends

“Today, the Bihar government, steeped in power and arrogance, has gone astray. Neither they speak well nor do they do any good. Workers are helpless, farmers are harassed and the youth are disappointed today. The fragile state of the economy overshadows the lives of the people and there is a serious crisis for the sons of the soil. Dalits and Mahadalits have been left on the verge of misery and backward sections of society are also victims of this plight,” Ms. Gandhi said in her message.

“The voice of the people of Bihar is with the Congress grand alliance. This is the call of Bihar today.”

She accused the governments of Delhi and Bihar of being ‘bandi’ or ‘lockdown’ governments — demonetisation, shutdown, economic shutdown, farms captive of new laws and a lockdown on employment and earnings.

“That’s why the people of Bihar are ready to create a new Bihar. Now change is in the air. Change is passion, energy, new thinking and power. Now is the time to write a new script of change,” Ms. Gandhi said.

Though Bihar had immense qualities in its hands, skill, strength and the power to construct, it had always had to deal with migration, unemployment, inflation and starvation.

“The inked finger that votes now will ask questions: The question of unemployment, question to save farming, the question about earning and employment, about education, health and industry. The question is to stop the unbridled crime. The question is on dictatorial governance,” she said.

Of the 243 Assembly seats, the Congress is contesting 70 seats as part of the grand alliance led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal and comprising the Left parties, including the CPI, the CPI (M) and the CPI (ML).

39,2020/10/27,Composer Carlos Rafael Rivera created individual scores for the chess matches in ‘The Queen’s Gambit’,"The Miami-based composer also talks about making music for the moments of addiction, loss, heartbreak, and victory, in the Netflix limited series

For composer Carlos Rafael Rivera, it all began in April 2018, with an email. Long-time friend and partner in crime, Oscar-winner Scott Frank, had just read The Queen’s Gambit by Walter Tevis and emailed to say that this was their next project. Carlos then proceeded to read the book, and immediately mapped out ideas for the score that would inexorably amplify the narrative in profound ways.

The duo had worked on Godless, a Western series on Netflix. But Netflix’s The Queen’s Gambit taps into the world of chess through a fictional story. Set in the Cold War era, it follows Elizabeth Harmon (Anya Taylor Joy) who develops a talent for chess during her early years in an orphanage. She is then adopted by a couple, and her talent is encouraged taking her around the world. However, Beth descends into a dependency on tranquilisers which darkens the plot — ultimately inviting Carlos to experiment with compositions.

Composing intrigue

“We were all concerned about visually translating the sport,” recalls Carlos over a call from his home in Miami, USA. “I’ve seen all the films and documentaries about chess that I could and I realised I had to score for 20-odd games where each one would have its own thing. And how do you make it interesting to people that do not know? I know baseball and football... I grew up with chess in that my dad played a little, but I never cared about it. But as long as you know that someone stands to lose, you can score for it. It didn’t work to write music that would apply to the games like a template.”

Carlos and Scott had gone back and forth for months until Carlos realised that writing for context was key — he had to score according to what happened before and after the match. The composer agrees that, given the story is centred on Beth, the music channels her emotions during a match too; if she’s feeling particularly competitive, there’s battle music, if she almost apologetically wins, the music portrays this too.

Beth, aloof in some moments and actually relatable in others, was “not a mono-thematic character.” Carlos, who is deeply impressed by actor Anya, started scoring aspects of her character, be it victory, addiction, heartbreak, or loss. He chuckles, adding, “These are very nerdy musical things! I wanted to present very cold and simple instrumentation in the form of piano and cello as she leaves the orphanage. By the time she goes to the USSR to compete, it is fully orchestral.”

The Queen’s Gambit features soundtrack as well as score, so Carlos states, “The songs of that time — such as Bill Compton’s ‘25th of the 12th’ and Peggy Lee’s ‘Fever’ — help place you in time more successfully than music ever would.” He also commends Wiley Stateman, the series’ sound designer, whom everyone dubs ‘Obi Wan Kenobi’ because he has worked for many Quentin Tarantino films including Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Carlos describes the symbiosis: “Music doesn’t live just against the picture, music lives in a landscape that is really terraformed by the dialogue and sound design. So Wiley and I collaborated very early on, working in tandem to help tell Scott’s story.”

Throughout the series, audiences will feel anchored by the sound of the ticking chess timer, around which some of the music was scored. “It’s in the main title which I wrote in December 2018 and Scott approved it,” agrees Carlos, “and it’s always been about a game of time… because it’s not only the two people playing against each other, it’s each individual playing against time. That clock is ever-present in the games. I had to let go of being at ‘quarter note equals 60’ or the tempo of an actual clock. At some point, the music just has to service the story. That was one of the great examples of collaborating with Wiley, in having these moments where music takes over or the clock takes over; it’s symbiotic. We had plenty of conversations about balancing the clock and the music. I also thought ‘this may be annoying to some people’ because the clock has its own tempo and then the music has another tempo. First of all, I try to avoid any percussive instruments that would kind of compete with it to create confusion because the clock is a percussion instrument in its own way. It was complicated to weave around without it becoming insanity-inducing.”

A lot of Beth’s pain is shown through the music, agrees Carlos who adds that he scored Beth’s biological mother, who is seen in flashbacks through the series. “Beth didn’t know how to love in those first eight years of her life — her father was absent and her mother was unstable — and she doesn’t understand that part of life. She does, however, understand chess, because she feels like she can control it. There was an empathy machine trigger that wasn’t activated in the first stage of her life, to no fault of her own; the music for these flashbacks are a variation that is darker and lower.” Then came scoring addiction. “There was this melodic idea that was actually slowed down and you’d hear it in the cello, to resonate that stoned point-of-view.”

A breakthrough

The series concludes with a tension-brimming match in the USSR between Beth and Vasily Borgov (Marcin Dorocinski). It’s a scene (no spoilers here) upon which Carlos looks back with a lot of respect. “When I got the final scene, I cried. I hadn’t written music. The scene was beautifully edited by Michelle Tesoro, beautifully shot by Steven Meizler, and beautifully directed and written by Scott Frank [laughs]. And Borgov, oh, [played by Dorocinski], I love his face, he’s such a good antagonist to her.” That scene propelled a creative outflow from Carlos,who says there was no heavy-lifting involved. “All the work that I had been doing for two years with all these melodies, fully matured like Beth. The music was written so fast then, and it was cathartic.”

Carlos feels blessed to be involved in storytelling that empowers women. “The time had come for women and chess, but represented fictionally. It’s about an orphan girl from Kentucky beating the Russians at their own game during the Cold War era, so it’s been a privilege to be a part of that storytelling.”

40,2020/10/27,Bharti Q2 loss narrows to ₹763 crore,"Bharti Airtel on Tuesday reported a net loss of ₹763 crore for the quarter ended September 30 even as it posted its highest-ever consolidated quarterly revenue of ₹25,785 crore driven by a rise in data usage and new 4G users.

The net loss for the second quarter is significantly lower than the net loss of ₹23,045 crore recorded in the July-September 2019 quarter on account of higher provisioning following a Supreme Court order related to adjusted gross revenues (AGR). “Despite being a seasonally weak quarter, we delivered a strong performance with revenue growing at 22% year-on-year,” said Gopal Vittal, MD and CEO, India & South Asia. “Our continued focus on ARPU improvement and cost optimisation led to EBITDA margin expansion by over 158 basis points in the quarter sequentially,” he added. The company said India revenue for the quarter came in at ₹18,747 crore, an increase of 22%, while mobile revenue rose 26%. The ARPU (average revenue per user) increased to ₹162 compared with ₹128 in year-earlier quarter. It added that 4G data customers increased by 48% to 152.7 million, while traffic increased to 77.3 petabytes (PB)/day compared with 48.9 PB/day a year earlier. Meanwhile, the home business segment witnessed a revenue growth of 7.3% with more than 1.29 lakh customers added during the quarter, taking the total base to 25.8 lakh customers.

On the AGR issue, the company said, “The group has represented to DoT that it has already paid more than 10% of the total dues as demanded by the DoT and will ensure ongoing compliance with the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s orders.”

Iron Pillar, the lead investor from the earlier round, has now invested $19 million.

The funds would be used for expansion in India and West Asia, Shan Kadavil, co-founder and CEO of FreshToHome, said in an interview.

FreshToHome, currently delivers 15 lakh orders of fish and meat a month and arns an annualised revenue of over ₹600 crore, is eyeing a revenue of ₹1,500 crore by March 2021.

“Fish and meat is a whopping $94 billion market in India, as estimated by Euromonitor International, and 99.97% of it is currently managed by unorganisesd players and retail stores. We see a huge opportunity for etailing in the sector. Even single digits market share means multi-billion dollars in revenues,’’ he said.

44,2020/10/27,‘About 25% of 5 mn Indian tech force facing existential crisis’,"They are in the 40-45 age bracket, possess generic skills: experts

About 25% of the country’s five million tech force falls under the ‘bulging middle’, who are in the age bracket of 40-45. Close to 30% of this generation, which works between the younger lot and the top management, are perennial job seekers, according to industry experts.

This means over 3.5 lakh CVs of mid-to-senior professionals are floating around in the job market and a large portion of these professionals possess only ‘generic, commodity skills’.

This ‘sandwiched generation’, therefore, faces an existential crisis as it finds it tough to align with the new realities, caution industry watchers.

For those above 40, who are not engineers from top institutions like the IITs, NITs, BITS Pilani, or are unemployed, career progression will be tough. Also, director-level openings at tech firms remain cold as employers are reworking the talent pyramid to fit into changing customer requirements, according to Xpheno, a city firm specialising in staffing.

Peter Bendor-Samuel, CEO at Everest Group, observes, “I see significant disruptions to the existing operating model which relies on large India-based talent factories. The model will have greater onshoring and the skillsets needed will evolve from traditional customer-facing to hardcore engineering with more industry and domain focus.”

Customers today want their service partners to bring in capabilities ranging from cloud engineering, to AI and data science. Also, creative skills around design thinking, story-telling, robotic process automation, mobility, data science, machine learning, data analytics, applied mathematics, ethnography, user interface, and communication will be most sought-after.

Hansa Iyengar, Principal Analyst - Digital Enterprise Services, Omdia, a London-based analyst firm, says, the pandemic is forcing rapid advancements across verticals as businesses accelerate digital transformation. Tech services vendors need to transform their internal processes and organisational structures for a business to move at customers’ desired speeds.

“This requires a rethink on how companies attract, train and retain people. We are seeing large-scale retraining and re-skilling targeting the middle-layer bulge most at risk of redundancy as digital takes the pilot seat,” points out Hansa.

Explaining the mid-work crisis further is Some of these mid-senior guys have been working on integration, processing of information, quality checks, analyses, bug clearing, etc.

“Today, developers are equipped to do full-stack development. Also, release cycles have fallen to a day from 3/4 months. Tools have changed too, now customers pick up tools [like Jira] for solutions,” said Krishnakumar Natarajan, Mindtree’s co-founder, and managing partner, Mela Ventures.

“Because of this scenario, many senior people doing information collation are losing jobs. Some started as developers, but as they grew they lost touch with technology. A majority are trying to catch up by learning new skills, but a sizeable number are finding it tough to pick up new skills and will become irrelevant,” he added.

B.S. Murthy, CEO of Leadership Capital, a CXO hiring firm in Bengaluru said, the biggest casualty of the digital transformation are professionals above 45, with 80% of them out of sync with hardcore technology.

He added, “Professionals who drive process-related middle management will see their roles automated. It is the generic project management, programme and delivery management roles that face extinction as these are commodity skills today.”

Commenting on the latest hiring trends, Kamal Karanth, co-founder, Xpheno, said: “There is a slowdown in active openings for director level and above positions as employers are currently working on changing the shape of their people pyramid. The active openings for senior managers are still 30% of pre-COVID-19 levels and hiring in this category is yet to pick up.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/5gsu0n/article32957720.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27BUSOFTWARE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/about-25-of-5-mn-indian-tech-force-facing-existential-crisis/article32957721.ece

46,2020/10/27,Harley opts to ride pillion with Hero,"Hero MotoCorp on Tuesday said it had entered into a distribution and licensing agreement with Harley-Davidson Inc. to develop and sell a range of premium motorcycles under the Harley-Davidson brand name in the country.

The move comes almost a month after the U.S. company announced its decision to discontinue sales and manufacturing operations in India as part of a global strategic restructuring plan — The Rewire.

“Hero MotoCorp will sell and service Harley-Davidson motorcycles, and sell parts and accessories and general merchandise riding gear and apparel through a network of” exclusive Harley-Davidson dealers as well as Hero’s existing dealer network, the Indian two-wheeler maker said in a statement.

These actions, Hero said, were aligned with Harley-Davidson’s business overhaul plan.

“This arrangement is mutually beneficial for both companies and riders in India, as it brings together the iconic Harley-Davidson brand with the strong distribution network and customer service of Hero MotoCorp,” it added.

Profit climbs

Separately, Harley-Davidson beat profit expectations on Tuesday as shipments improved from pandemic lows and the company reined in costs as part of CEO Jochen Zeitz’s restructuring plan, Reuters reported.

Net income rose to $120 million, or 78 cents per share, in the third quarter ended September 30, from $87 million, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier.

47,2020/10/27,"‘Negative or zero growth, but firm recovery on’","FM says overall GDP growth in FY21 could be close to IMF’s -10.3% estimate; expects festive season to spur, sustain demand

In the government’s first remarks about the growth outlook for this year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said that India’s GDP could see zero or negative growth, somewhat close to the International Monetary Fund’s projection of -10.3% for 2020-21.

The Minister, however, exuded confidence that a steady and sustainable recovery was already underway, adding India would emerge as one of the fastest growing economies next year.

‘Agri doing well’

“The indicators show that the primary sector and related sectors of agriculture and rural India are doing very well,” Ms. Sitharaman said. “As a result, the demand for durables, agriculture equipment, tractors, vehicles are all going up. The festival season has commenced in India, as a result of which I expect the demand to go up and therefore, be sustainable also,” she added.

Citing the Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector in September, which stood at 56.8, Ms. Sitharaman said that this was the highest since 2012 and indicated that the revival was going to be steady and sustainable. “If that sustainable revival is going to happen between the third and fourth quarters, we expect that the overall GDP growth, notwithstanding the pandemic, should be something which as is being predicted by the IMF, growth will be negative or near zero this time. Next year, it will be clearly India seeing itself as one of the fastest growing economies,” she said.

The IMF, in its World Economic Outlook released earlier this month, forecast India’s GDP would shrink 10.3% in 2020-21, and likely rebound to grow at 8.8% in the next financial year.

The contraction in the first quarter was a result of the government’s conscious decision to ‘put lives before livelihoods’ and enforce a ‘very firm lockdown’, the Minister said in response to a query about India’s economic outlook by Lance Uggla, chairman and chief executive officer of IHS Markit, which compiles the PMI. Mr. Uggla said the firm’s global economics team expects India’s GDP growth to reach 9.3% next year.

‘Build assets’

To revive the economy, the government is eyeing sectors that can help build assets and generate employment, the Minister said, adding that public spending on infrastructure and boosting agriculture and easing farm produce exports, were part of that plan.

Ms. Sitharaman, who was speaking at the India Energy Forum, said that India should have a greater role in setting global fuel prices as one of the largest consumers of energy, adding that the country was looking at investing in strategic fields overseas to achieve this objective.

“We are investing in strategic reserves not just within India, but also looking at buying out fields outside India. This gives us the feeling and commercial sense that units elsewhere where India invests, will enable us to be a part of the global value chain and get to play a part in price determination… Because being the largest consumer, we should also play a part in being active in determining the price,” Ms. Sitharaman said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/gnm3sr/article32957616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THBUNIRMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/negative-or-zero-growth-but-firm-recovery-on/article32957617.ece
48,2020/10/27,10th accused arrested in TRP manipulation scam,"Hansa Research denies allegations of financial transaction with Republic TV

The Mumbai Police have arrested a 10th person, a resident of Thane, for his alleged involvement in the Television Rating Points (TRP) manipulation scam.

“During investigation, he confessed that he has been accepting money from at least two news channels [Republic and News Nation] and used to pay to certain households through his associates. Two of such associates have earlier been arrested in this regard,” the Detection Crime Branch of the Mumbai Police said in a statement.

It said many of the arrested and some of the wanted accused were employees of Hansa Research Group Pvt Ltd and they misused the confidential data. “It has apparently been done for wrongful gains of various TV channels which had resulted in wrongful loss to various advertisers and their agencies. Preliminary investigations also revealed that the accused persons have manipulated the sampling metering services by inducing the barometer users by paying them periodically to watch particular TV channel/s,” the statement added.

“Many people, in whose homes these barometers were installed, have accepted that they have been monetarily benefited for keeping their TV sets on even if they actually didn’t watch.”

Stating that a team of forensic auditors had been specially deployed to assist the Special Investigation Team (SIT), the Mumbai Police said it had been revealed during the course of the investigation that the suspected TV channels were manipulating the viewerships to get better rates of advertisements as it was their only source of revenue.

The police said a money trail of transactions between a Hansa Group company and ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, which is the company operating Republic TV channels, was revealed. “These transactions and such connectivity with the suspect channels was not revealed to the SIT by any of the witnesses from any of the Hansa Group companies. As a matter of policy, the SIT is committed towards a fair probe,” the statement said.

Hansa Research said it had no business dealings with Republic TV and had not made any payment to the channel nor received from it. Shekar Swamy, group CEO, Hansa, said: “Our group company Hansa Vision India Pvt Ltd is in the advertising business. It purchases advertising time and space in various TV channels and other media regularly for its clients. This is normal, routine business.”

The last time Hansa Vision had purchased advertising time in Republic TV was two years ago for a value of ₹108 lakh. “The Mumbai Police are perhaps incorrectly linking this with the current TRP-related investigation.” Mr. Swami said in 2019 and 2020, Hansa Vision had not bought any advertising time from the Republic TV.

“Hansa Research and the people working for this company have nothing to do with the advertising activities of the group company Hansa Vision.” Hansa Research works for BARC to collect data from the 30,000 barometers installed across Indian homes to monitor various programmes for assignment of TRP.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/10th-accused-arrested-in-trp-manipulation-scam/article32958177.ece

50,2020/10/27,Dynastic corruption is a challenge to progress: PM Modi,"Inaction against one generation emboldens several: Modi

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said dynastic corruption, which had become a part of political culture in several States over the past few decades, had emerged as a major challenge and could enfeeble the country.

Inaugurating the three-day National Conference on Vigilance and Anti-Corruption, organised by the Central Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Modi said ineffective action against one generation of offenders emboldened the next generation to indulge more in corrupt practices.

The Prime Minister said laxity in even one case contributed to creating a conducive atmosphere for more corruption in the future. Owing to ineffective action, corruption would become business as usual for a large section of society and the media, and such a situation was a big stumbling block in the country's development.

52,2020/10/27,Coronavirus | Centre expresses concern over decline in daily COVID-19 tests in Odisha,"We are following the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, says official

The Centre has expressed concern over the decline in the number of daily COVID-19 tests in Odisha.

Coronavirus India lockdown day 215 updates

At a recently held meeting with 14 States, the Union Health Ministry pointed out that there was a steady decline in the number of tests being conducted in Odisha.

The State, which had touched 68,906 tests on August 22, has been bringing down them consistently. The last over 50,000 tests were carried out on September 29.

According to the Health department, 30,303 tests were conducted during the past 24 hours. On October 22 and 23, more than 40,000 tests were conducted. Experts believed that the daily spike in the cases was going down as the State was testing fewer people.

Asked why there had been consistent decline in the daily tests, Shalini Pandit, State Mission Director of the National Health Mission, said, “Odisha is testing as per requirements following the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines on testing. Our testing load will depend on the number of symptomatic cases, contacts of positive cases and active containment zones. It will rise or fall as per these indicators.”

The proceedings of the review meeting say the split of tests is skewed more towards antigen tests while this needs to be balanced with adequate rapid antigen tests of symptomatic with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

The Centre has directed Odisha to go for a robust follow-up of home-isolated patients either through physical visits or telephonic monitoring of their clinical status. The directive was issued as about 70% of patients were under home isolation.

53,2020/10/27,Agriculture laws | Farmers plan national road blockade on November 5,"Delhi Chalo protest on Nov 26, 27 could draw thousands of farmers to capital

Over 500 farmers groups plan to block roads across the country on November 5, as part of an all-India “chakka jam”, the next step in their protests against the three controversial farm reform laws passed by Parliament last month.

The groups, which include several major federations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Union and the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, are also planning a march to the national capital on November 26 and 27, if their demands to repeal the laws are not accepted. They are also opposing the Electricity Bill 2020, which could affect the power subsidy given to farmers. Some leaders estimated that more than 40,000 farmers from Punjab alone could take part in the Delhi Chalo protest.

Also read: Ground Zero | Farm Bills leave farmers, commission agents and workers worried

The farmers groups also slammed the Centre’s ban on the movement of goods trains to Punjab, terming it as ‘blackmail’ of the people. The Railway Ministry had refused to run goods trains unless the State ensured that the tracks were completely cleared of protesting farmers who are still preventing some passenger trains from running.

“We have mostly ended our rail roko five days ago itself on October 22. There are still some protesters near Amritsar, blocking passenger trains and trains running to some private power plants,” said Darshan Pal, president of the Krantikari Kisan Union, which is one of the leaders of the Punjab protests.

“But without the goods trains, there is a shortage of essential items in Punjab, and farmers also find it difficult to get fertilizers and other inputs. That is why we stopped the rail roko. But the BJP is intent on giving a bad name to the protesters, and so it is carrying out this blackmail of the people and farmers of Punjab.”

After a meeting at Gurudwara Rakabganj in the capital on Tuesday, it was decided that the November protests would be coordinated under the leadership of a committee including AIKSCC convenor VM Singh, BKU-Ekta president Balbir Singh Rajewal, BKU’s Haryana chief Gurnam Singh, former Maharashtra MP and Swabhimani Paksha head Raju Shetti and Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav.

Farmers leaders were keen to emphasise the national nature of the struggle, as opposed to the popular perception that it is limited to a few northern States. “This will be an all-India protest. There are ongoing protests in Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, but the media is focussing only on Punjab and Haryana. We will show that the farmers of India are united against these laws,” said Sunilam, convenor of the National Alliance of People’s Movements, which is also an AIKSCC constituent.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/g8iwra/article32941327.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDFARMERSPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/farm-laws-farmers-plan-national-road-blockade-on-nov-5/article32956741.ece
54,2020/10/27,"Coronavirus | Children could be spreaders or super-spreaders of COVID-19, says ICMR","‘Pollution is a major contributor to COVID-19 mortality’

Asserting there is clear indication that pollution is a major contributor to COVID-19 mortality, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) also said on Tuesday that children who were earlier thought to be better protected against COVID-virus are now showing some evidence of being spreaders or even super spreaders.

Also read: Coronavirus | ICMR approves low-cost testing method developed by IIT Kharagpur

“This has been seen in Mizoram, where the number of active COVID cases is small. Children (under 17-years) form only a very small portion (8%) of the total active cases across India,” said ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava, while speaking at a Health Ministry press meet on Tuesday.

Speaking about Kawasaki disease occurring alongside COVID-19, he said that Kawasaki disease is an auto-immune disease that affects children who are less than 5 years of age. “It is less common in India. I don’t think we have had any experience of Kawasaki with COVID-19 in India so far. That’s a very rare condition,’’ he said.

Stating that there should be no hurry to declare ourselves COVID-19 free, the Health Ministry said that the idea was to tackle the virus in a slow, steady manner.

“What is a matter of concern now is the fact that States like Kerala, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi are not showing an improvement to the level we were expecting. 58% of new deaths are reported in five States and Union Territories [Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka] in the last 24 hours,” added Rajesh Bhushan, Secretary, Union Health Ministry.

Calling COVID-19 a “mischievous virus” which is “still threatening an overwhelming [part of the] population”, NITI Aayog member V.K. Paul said, “Though India’s numbers are improving, we are still vulnerable. We are seeing a second wave in several regions and the U.S. is seeing its third peak.”

“Winters could be playing a role as is the fact that we may be becoming lax about the prevention measures. Slowing down containment strategy is also playing an important role [in the pandemic],” he said.

“The fact that even countries of much greater economic capability, per capita income and good health systems can succumb to a huge second peak is a lesson for all of us,” Dr. Paul added.

Drop in new cases

Speaking about the COVID-19 trends in India, Mr. Bhushan said that the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases in India in the last 24 hours has fallen below 36,500 (36,470) for the first time in three months. The new cases were 34,884 on July 18, 2020.

“With a high number of COVID patients recovering every day, and the sustained fall in the mortality rate, India’s steady trend of registering dipping active cases continues. The active cases have declined to 6.25 lakh, and the total positive cases of the country are 6,25,857 and now comprise 7.88% of the total cases,” he added.

The Ministry said that 35% of the total active cases in the country on Tuesday are being reported from only 18 districts.

“The slide in active cases is supplemented by an exponential rise in the recoveries. The total recovered cases have crossed 72 lakh (72,01,070). The national recovery rate has further grown to 90.62%,” said Mr. Bhushan.

He added that 78% of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 States/UTs, with Maharashtra leading with more than 9,000 single day recoveries, followed by Karnataka with more than 8,000 recoveries. 76% of the new confirmed cases are from 10 States and UTs, and Kerala and West Bengal have contributed the maximum to the new cases, with more than 4,000 cases each.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Tuesday said the “guidelines for reopening” issued last month, permitting cinema halls, entertainment parks and swimming pools for sports persons to open, will continue to be applicable till November 30 in areas outside the containment zones.

Full coverage on coronavirus

The guidelines issued on September 30 were to be in force till October 31.

The lockdown shall continue to be implemented strictly in the containment zones during the period, the MHA said.

Appropriate behaviour

“The essence behind graded reopening and progressive resumption of activities is to move ahead. However, it does not mean the end of the pandemic. There is need to exercise abundant caution by adopting COVID-19 appropriate behaviour by every citizen in their daily routine,” the MHA order said.

The Ministry said it had advised Chief Secretaries and administrators of all States and Union Territories that they “should endeavour to promote COVID-19 appropriate behaviour extensively at the grass roots level and take measures to enforce the wearing of masks, hand hygiene and social distancing.”

Coronavirus India lockdown day 215 updates

A countrywide lockdown in the wake of the pandemic was first imposed on March 24. It has been relaxed considerably over the past seven months with many economic activities allowed. The total number of COVID-19 cases has surged past 79 lakh and more than 1.19 lakh deaths have been reported.

The guidelines said that international travel, except those permitted by the Centre, would remain shut while the State governments were given the flexibility to decide on reopening of schools and coaching institutions in a graded manner.

The decision is to be taken in consultation with the respective school and institution managements, based on their assessment of the situation, and subject to certain conditions, according to the guidelines.

The activities permitted in areas outside the containment zones were -- cinemas, theatres and multiplexes with up to 50 % of their seating capacity, Business to Business (B2B) exhibitions, swimming pools used for training of sportspersons, entertainment parks and similar places.

Various ministries and departments have issued standard operating procedures for the reopening of activities.

Political gatherings in poll-bound Bihar and those constituencies where by-elections will be held were allowed with an attendance of a maximum of 200 people in a close space or hall and in an open space depending on its size. The political gatherings can be held only outside the containment zones.

The lockdown shall continue to be implemented strictly in the containment zones during the period.

56,2020/10/27,Tanishq ad: Plea in High Court to regulate news channels from broadcasting content on communal disharmony,"The plea said it can be clearly inferred from the Tata jewellery brand advertisement that its purpose was to showcase the spirit of unity and brotherhood amongst two religious groups.

Amid row over the recent Tanishq advertisement showing inter-faith couple, a plea has been moved in the Delhi High Court seeking to regulate news channels over broadcast and publishing of content based on communal disharmony and hate speech.

The plea said it can be clearly inferred from the Tata jewellery brand advertisement that its purpose was to showcase the spirit of unity and brotherhood amongst two religious groups.

However, news channel Sudarshan TV in its October 12 show ‘Bindas Bol’, made their best attempts to incite hatred amongst the two religious groups by terming the ad as ‘advertisement jihad’, the petition filed by an advocate said.

The government on Tuesday unveiled a set of guidelines for recognising and regulating awarding bodies and assessment agencies, to improve the outcomes and standardise the processes under the Skill India Mission.

The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), in collaboration with its unified regulator National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET), unveiled the guidelines and operation manuals. The norms have been developed for the recognition and regulation of awarding bodies and assessment agencies, as these two entities are key elements in the skilling ecosystem.

The guidelines, aimed at boosting the skilling ecosystem in the country, will strengthen the regulation of bodies that certify skilled candidates across sectors.

“The measures announced today (on Tuesday) to improve skilling outcomes through NCVET will impart a lot of effectiveness to the process of assessment and certification,” Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Minister Mahendra Nath Pandey said at a virtual conference to launch the guidelines.

He said that with the government focusing on building skilled manpower, nearly 5 crore youth have been trained during the past five years and the number of industrial training institutes (ITIs) in the country has gone up to around 15,000 with 24 lakh seats.

“Our country caters to a diverse skilling ecosystem which is supported by key stakeholders, and organisations. Therefore, it is imperative to have a vibrant policy framework that encourages improvements and key transformations in the skilling network,” said the minister.

He added that the innovative methods and constructive tools underlined under the guidelines in the management of skilling institutions will create a regulated regime.

The NCVET was notified by the skill development and entrepreneurship ministry in December 2018. It acts as an overarching skills regulator that regulates the functioning of entities engaged in vocational education and training, and establishes standards for the functioning of such entities.

“With NCVET’s sincere efforts in framing the guidelines and the operational manuals, the country’s skilling ecosystem will witness robust regulations addressing the needs of multitude of stakeholders,” according to an official statement.

It added that the uniform certificate formats developed by NCVET is also a step in the right direction and a much-needed reform. “It will bring about uniformity and and enhance the authenticity of the certification.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k71e0o/article32955276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PANDEYKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-unveils-new-norms-for-awarding-bodies-assessment-agencies-to-boost-skilling-ecosystem/article32955277.ece

“You have to do something... You have to find some solution”, Justice M.R. Shah, a member of the three-judge Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan, addressed Additional Solicitor General K.M. Nataraj, representing the Centre.

But the Centre said it was making every attempt to bring them home and the “availability of flights is no more a reason for being stranded in Kuwait”.

Referring to a short affidavit filed in court, Mr. Nataraj said the government was “fully sensitive to the difficulties faced by the Indian citizens”.

Flights scheduled

Mr. Nataraj said 83 flights of Air India, Air India Express and IndiGo have already been scheduled to fly from Kuwait to various destinations in India.

Foreign airlines have also been pitching in with flights to India. The Vande Bharat Mission was on its seventh phase of operations in October.

Mr. Nataraj hinted that there were some “diplomatic issues” to be considered.

“That is why we are saying you have to find some solution... They want to get out of Kuwait”, Justice Shah said.

Senior advocate S. Nagamuthu, for Velinadu Vazh Tamilar Nala Sangham, said nearly 33,000 Indians were in dire straits in Kuwait without food, water and basic comforts. Every day was a trial for them while awaiting repatriation.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday left it to the Allahabad High Court to monitor the CBI investigation into the alleged gangrape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit girl by four upper-caste accused persons in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh.

A three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, in a 16-page verdict, concluded that there was no need to divest the Lucknow Bench of the High Court of the case to directly monitor the case itself.

Without expressing any opinions on the facts of the case and the allegations made, the apex court left it open for the High Court to consider the CBI probe and grievances about the “illegal cremation”. The CBI has to report to the High Court about its progress.

The apex court said the High Court had taken suo motu cognisance of the case and passed a detailed order on October 1.

“The High Court has adequately delved into the aspects relating to the case to secure fair investigation and has also secured the presence of the father, mother, brother and sister-in-law of the victim and appropriate orders are being passed, including securing reports from various quarters. In that circumstance, we do not find it necessary to divest the High Court of the proceedings and take upon this Court to monitor the proceedings/investigation”, the judgment said.

The court, moreover, said since the incident occurred within the jurisdiction of the High Court, it would be “appropriate” for the High Court to monitor the probe “in the manner in which it would desire”.

The court said there was no need to transfer the trial to Delhi for the time being as the CBI had taken over the investigation and there was “no room for apprehensions at this stage”. The central agency took over the probe on October 11.

The Bench said it would be appropriate if the probe was completed first. However, it kept the question of transfer of trial open for consideration, if required, in the future.

The court gave liberty to the petitioners to approach the High Court with their respective pleas regarding the manner in which she lost her life and how she was cremated in the middle of the night allegedly in the absence of her relatives.

CRPF security

The court said it felt that adequate security for the victim’s family and witnesses have been provided by the State police. The Bench, however, to address the “normal perception and pessimism which cannot be said as being without justification”, ordered security arrangements to be transferred to the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), which has to swing into action within a week.

It directed the State Chief Secretary to forthwith communicate the order to a competent CRPF officer. A status report will be filed in the High Court in this regard.

The order of transfer of security duties should not be construed to be casting an aspersion on the State police, the court stressed. “The step is to be seen only as a ‘confidence-building measure’,” the Bench recorded.

The court found no need to pass any specific orders for the appointment of a Special Public Prosecutor as sought by senior advocate Indira Jaising, who appeared for some women advocates.

65,2020/10/27,India calls for complete ceasing of support to terrorist forces in Middle East,"“Political instability, long-festering conflicts, sectarian divides, issue of refugees and terrorism continue to plague the region.”

India has called on all concerned parties to completely stop supporting terrorist forces, like the ISIL, while urging all stakeholders in the Middle East to work constructively for peace, stability and development.

India underscored that it has invested considerably in the peace and stability of the region by deploying its personnel as part of UN peacekeeping forces, through humanitarian assistance, development cooperation, capacity building, and will continue contributing towards peace-building in the Middle East.

India calls on concerned parties to completely stop support to terrorist forces, like ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) and others. India also urges all parties in the region to work constructively and in good faith to promote peace, stability and development for the benefit of all people in the Middle East, India said in a written statement on Monday on the Security Council’s open debate on ‘The Situation in the Middle East’.

India said the truce between Israel and the Hamas has eased the humanitarian situation in Gaza and expressed hope that the temporary truce is converted into a permanent ceasefire, which can save precious human lives on both sides and create a conducive environment for talks.

“It is an unfortunate reality that the interlinked and mutually reinforcing challenges faced by the people of the Middle East have not yet been resolved. Political instability, long-festering conflicts, sectarian divides, issue of refugees and terrorism continue to plague the region. The COVID-pandemic has only exacerbated the threats posed by these challenges,” India said.

The statement made India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador T.S. Tirumurti, will go as part of the official record of the Council.

India said it appreciates the agreement between Fatah and Hamas for holding Parliamentary and Presidential elections and also elections for the Palestinian National Council, which will help fulfill the democratic aspirations of the Palestinian people.

India also welcomed the agreements for normalisation of relations between Israel and the UAE and Bahrain. India has always supported peace and stability in West Asia, which is our extended neighbourhood, India said.

Further, India said the commencement of discussions on the disputed border between Israel and Lebanon is a significant development, expressing hope that this will provide an opportunity to resolve the longstanding issue between the two countries.

India highlighted that Palestinian aspirations for a sovereign and independent state are yet to be fulfilled and stressed that New Delhi has been unwavering in its commitment to the Palestinian cause and continues to remain supportive of a peaceful negotiated resolution of the Palestinian issue.

“India has supported the two-state solution as a just and acceptable solution to the conflict. Establishment of a Palestinian State living side-by-side in peace and security with Israel, within mutually agreed borders should be achieved through negotiations directly by the two parties, India said adding that any stalemate could strengthen the hands of extremists and shut the door to cooperation thereby jeopardising the security, stability and prosperity of the people on both sides and the region.

Accordingly, India urged Israel and Palestine to resume direct negotiations at the earliest and called upon the international community to take concrete steps towards resuming and facilitating these negotiations quickly.

India noted that the decade-long armed conflict in Syria has claimed over 400,000 lives, displaced 6.2 million people internally and compelled another 6.3 million people to seek shelter in neighbouring countries.

While we are heartened to see return of normalcy to major parts of the country, we are also reminded of the enormous resources that would be required to provide urgent humanitarian aid, rebuild infrastructure, enable return of the refugees and restore a normal and dignified life of all Syrians, the statement said.

India said in the statement that it is not only contributing to the return of normalcy and rebuilding of Syria, but has also consistently called for a comprehensive and peaceful resolution of the Syrian conflict through a Syrian-led dialogue, taking into account the legitimate aspirations of the people of Syria.

India voiced concern over the security and humanitarian situation in Yemen and said the recent exchange of prisoners by the Government of Yemen and Ansar Allah, who had been detained in connection with the conflict, is a welcome development.

“India hopes that the parties will take more confidence building measures to provide the necessary impetus for the full implementation of the Stockholm Agreement,” the statement read.

India also hopes for peace and stability in Iraq with full respect for Iraq’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

India noted that in the aftermath of the August blast that brought destruction to vast swathes of Beirut and inflicted heavy loss of lives, India stood in solidarity with Lebanon.

New Delhi sent emergency humanitarian aid of over 58 metric tons to Beirut. We look forward to the swift formation of a new government that can offer political stability and also tackle the grave socio-economic challenges being faced by the people of Lebanon, the statement said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/iifhqc/article32952415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAQ-SECURITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-calls-for-complete-ceasing-of-support-to-terrorist-forces-in-middle-east/article32952416.ece

“We have no problems if other States also give free vaccines, our promise relates to the fact that health is a State subject and if NDA is voted to power in the State, we will provide free vaccines. The Congress party has in the past promised farm loan waivers in almost every election they have fought with a patchy compliance on that promise, attracting far less opprobrium,” he said. Mr. Prasad has been campaigning in the Assembly polls and has expressed the confidence that the NDA will form the next government in the State.

The BJP had, in its manifesto promised free vaccines for COVID-19 if voted to power and 19 lakh jobs as well. The vaccine promise had set off a controversy with Opposition leaders questioning the morality of promising free vaccines to one State as an election promise while the whole country was suffering. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister E. Palaniswami have also promised free vaccines once they were approved for disbursal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/t2zr8w/article32952001.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAVISHANKARPRASAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ravi-shankar-prasad-says-bjp-is-proud-of-free-covid-19-vaccine-promise-in-bihar/article32952002.ece
67,2020/10/27,PM Modi lauds beneficiaries of scheme for street vendors,"During interaction with PM SVANidhi loanees from U.P., Modi says most repaying on time

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday interacted via video-conferencing with street vendors from Uttar Pradesh who had availed of loans under the PM Street Vendors Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) and said most of the beneficiaries were repaying their loans on time.

The scheme, which provides vendors collateral-free working capital loans of ₹10,000, was announced on June 1 as a part of the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat package in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis.

So far, 24.76 lakh applications have been received, of which 12.37 lakh have been sanctioned and over 5 lakh loans have been disbursed, according to the PM SVANidhi portal.

While addressing the street vendors, Mr. Modi said Uttar Pradesh accounted for 6.5 lakh applications and 4.25 lakh approved loans. He said those who played politics in the name of the poor had given the impression that the poor would not repay loans. But, he added, the poor had presented an example of their honesty by repaying their PM SVANidhi loans.

Modi interacts with street vendors

Earlier, Mr. Modi interacted with vendors from Agra, Varanasi and Lucknow, and asked them about their experiences with the lockdown and the scheme.

Preeti Devi, a fruit seller from Agra, said she used to sell vegetables prior to the lockdown.

“During the lockdown, we felt like we were drowning,” she said. She added that with the PM SVANidhi loan she was able to restart her work and set up a fruit cart. Ms Preeti said she had repaid the first instalment.

Arvind Maurya, who runs a stall selling momos and coffee in Varanasi, which is Mr. Modi's Lok Sabha constituency, told the Prime Minister that he was able to get the loan within a week of applying.

Mr. Modi asked him if momos were a popular snack in Varanasi, adding that security personnel don’t let him eat street food during his visits. The Prime Minister appreciated Mr. Maurya’s initiative of giving one free momo to customers who wear masks, maintain social distancing and pay digitally.

Mr. Modi also interacted with a food stall owner from Lucknow, Vijay Bahadur.

In his address later, Mr. Modi congratulated bank employees for their efforts in disbursing loans.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/10brnv/article32951001.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SVANidhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-interacts-with-street-vendors-benefitted-from-pm-svanidhi-scheme/article32951002.ece

He made the comments at a review meeting of the IOEs chaired by him along with Minister of State for Education Sanjay Dhotre.

“Various topics were discussed during the meeting like: What measures can be taken to accelerate the recruitment of #international faculty. The progress of IoEs shall be mapped with the indicators of THE/QS World University Rankings and international standards,” Mr. Nishank tweeted.

“An incentive mechanism for institutions shall be developed to reward the IoEs that are doing well. An integrated portal containing world-class #research papers from all HEIs shall be made,” he further said.

The Minister said that numerous measures shall be taken to engineer a better perception of IoEs.

“Officials were directed to develop a detailed strategy (with both qualitative and quantitative parameters) for brand building of the institutes. NEP recommendations such as Multiple Entry-Exit, Online Degrees, Multidisciplinary, Internationalization etc. shall be leveraged to ensure the success of IoEs,” he said.

According to officials, the institutions have been asked to put more efforts to represent India in a better way in global rankings .

“The Minister pointed out in the meeting that institutions should work on the internationalization of our education and should promote multidisciplinary streams in their institutes as per the vision of NEP,” a senior official said.

The Education Ministry had launched the IoE scheme in 2018 as per which 20 institutions were to be selected — 10 public and 10 private — that will enjoy complete academic and administrative autonomy.

In the first lot, IIT-Delhi, IIT-Bombay and the Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Science (IISc) were awarded the status in the public sector, and Manipal Academy of Higher Education and BITS Pilani in the private sector, while the Jio Institute by Reliance Foundation was given the tag in Greenfield category.

Last september, five public institutions including Delhi University, Banaras Hindu University, University of Hyderabad, IIT-Madras and IIT-Kharagpur, were granted the eminent status.

A Letter of Intent for granting the IoE status was also issued to five private universities — Amrita Vidyapeetham and Vellore Institute of Technology in Tamil Nadu, Odhisha’s Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology, Jamia Hamdard University in Delhi and Satya Bharti Foundation’s Bharti Instiute in Mohali.

While the government will provide funding upto ₹1,000 crore to public institutions with IoE tag, in case of the private institutions proposed as Institutions of Eminence, there will be no financial support. But they will be entitled to more autonomy as a special category Deemed University.

“During these challenging times, we have witnessed investments through the oil and gas value chain and are seeing similar signs in other sectors too,” Mr. Modi said, stressing that a self-reliant India, with energy security at its core, ‘will also be a force multiplier for the global economy’.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi flew down to address as many as three rallies where he urged the voters to vote Chief Minister Nitish Kumar back to power. Rahul Gandhi, whose party is contesting the elections in alliance with Lalu Prasad's RJD and 3 Left parties, also chipped in with two rallies.

71,2020/10/27,Male govt. employees entitled to child care leave as single parents: Jitendra Singh,"Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Monday said male government employees who were single parents were now entitled to child care leave.

“Single male parent” included employees who were unmarried or widower or divorcee and might therefore be expected to take up the responsibility of caring for a child single-handedly, he said.

Describing it as a path-breaking and progressive reform to bring ease of living for government servants, Mr. Singh said orders regarding the decision were issued some time ago but somehow did not get enough traction in public domain.

In further relaxation, the Minister of State for Personnel said an employee on child care leave might now leave the headquarters with the prior approval of the competent authority, according to an official statement.

In addition, the Leave Travel Concession (LTC) might be availed by the employee even if he was on child care leave, he added.

The child care leave could be granted at 100% of leave salary for the first 365 days and 80% of leave salary for the next 365 days, Mr. Singh said in the statement issued by the Personnel Ministry.

Based on inputs received over a period of time, he said another welfare measure introduced in this regard was that in case of a disabled child, the condition of availing child care leave up to the age of 22 years of the child had been removed.

Now child care leave could be availed by a government servant for a disabled child of any age, he added.

With the personal intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his special emphasis on governance reforms, Mr. Singh said, it had been possible to make several out-of-the-box decisions in the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) over the last six years.

The basic purpose behind all these decisions had always been to enable a government employee to contribute to the maximum of his potential, although at the same time there would be no leniency or tolerance towards corruption or non-performance, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/das4xj/article32948553.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JITENDRASINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/male-govt-employees-entitled-to-child-care-leave-as-single-parents-jitendra-singh/article32948554.ece

All the six were residents of Rajshahi district. According to the BSF, since there is a ban on Hilsa fishing, the fishermen had entered Indian waters.

The other two, a farmer and a 19-year-old youth, were arrested last week for entering India at two different locations in the south Bengal frontier, the BSF statement said.

74,2020/10/27,"21% decline in cases, preliminary enquiries registered by CBI","Conviction rate increased from 68% to 69.19% in 2019 compared to the previous year, says CVC annual report

There was a 21% decline in the registration of cases and preliminary enquiries (PEs) by the CBI in 2019 compared to 2018, according to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) annual report.

The agency registered 899 cases and PEs in 2018, while the figure was 710 last year. The cases of alleged bribe demand also declined by almost 26%, from 156 in 2018 to 116 in 2019.

In 2018, 898 investigations were pending for more than one year, while in 2019 the probe was pending for over a year in 744 cases. The number of investigations pending at the end of the year stood at 1,541 in 2018 while it was 1,239 last year.

The conviction rate increased from 68% to 69.19% in 2019 compared to the previous year.

Under the Prevention of Corruption Act, the cases declined from 460 involving 867 public servants in 2018 to 396, involving 607 public servants, last year.

“The CBI is normally required to complete investigation of a registered case within one year. Completion of investigation would imply filing of chargesheets in courts wherever warranted, after receipt of sanction from the competent authority. The Commission has observed that there have been some delays in completing investigations in certain cases,” said the report.

Listing the reasons, the CVC said there was work overload, inadequate manpower, delays in obtaining responses to Letters Rogatory sent to foreign jurisdictions for gathering information, verification of documents in disproportionate assets cases and in getting reports from forensic laboratories and other experts.

There were also delays in receipt of prosecution sanction from competent authorities and supply of departmental records; scrutiny of voluminous records took time, specially in economic offences and bank fraud cases; and locating and examining witnesses living in distant places was also a time-consuming exercise.

In its last year’s annual report, the CVC had noted that with effect from July 26, 2018, the Prevention of Corruption Act was amended with the introduction of Section 17-A.

It lays down that “no police officer shall conduct any enquiry or inquiry or investigation into any offence alleged to have been committed by a public servant under this Act, where the alleged offence is relatable to any recommendation made or decision taken by such public servant in discharge of his official functions or duties, without the previous approval of the competent authority”.

Under Section 8(1) (d) of the CVC Act, the Commission has the power to inquire or cause an inquiry or investigation to be made into any complaint against any official under its jurisdiction wherein an offence under the PC Act is alleged to have been committed.

“However, there is no exemption from the operation of Section 17-A of PC Act [of previous approval] in respect of cases referred by the Commission under Section 8 of CVC Act leading to the decision/order of the Commission being subjected to further consideration by the competent authority under Section 17-A of PC Act. This, apart from leading to an anomalous situation of Commission’s orders being reviewed by a lower authority, also leads to delays,” the 2018 report said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vzdos4/article32947978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CBI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/21-decline-in-cases-preliminary-enquiries-registered-by-cbi/article32947979.ece

Ramesh Kumar on local body polls as it suspected that the SEC might have “ulterior motives”.

In a letter, Mr. Rambabu said the SEC should have waited for the Supreme Court judgment, and said that the apex court had stated that the SEC should consider the views expressed by the State Government before going ahead with the poll process. He wondered why the SEC was going ahead with the process without consulting either the Chief Secretary or the Medical and Health Secretary on whether it was possible to conduct local body elections. This shows that the SEC has a different agenda and hence the party decided to keep off the meeting, he said.

He said that the SEC move to hold one-on-one discussions with parties without holding discussions with the State government or the Chief Secretary on the feasibility of holding the polls, was part of a ploy being played by Mr. Ramesh Kumar and N. Chandrababu Naidu.

MR. Rambabu claimed the motive of the meeting in calling parties that do not command any vote base in the State would soon be exposed.

He questioned why the SEC postponed the polls when there were less than three COVID-19 cases in the State but was ready to hold he polls when the State was registering 3,000 cases a day. Mr. Rambabu exuded confidence that the YSRCP would win all the seats in the elections.

It will enable the SSSCT to actively engage with ECOSOC and its subsidiary bodies and participate in their programmes in several ways. The trust can also make representations to the United Nations in the fields where it has contributed over the past many decades.

Managing trustee R.J. Rathnakar said the status was of enormous significance for the trust and the Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organisation as it would give the SSSCT a global stage for promoting and spreading the five human values ‘sathya (truth), dharma (righteousness), shanti (peace), prema (love) and ahimsa (non-violence) advocated by Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba.

“This also gives us a great opportunity to expand the service activities of the Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organisation all over the world and reach the people who are in need so that we can spread the love of Sai Baba for the humanity,” Mr. Rathnakar added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/un-body-confers-special-status-on-sathya-sai-trust/article32956333.ece

By midnight, the crowd was beyond the control of the police as devotees, in two different groups, tried to get hold of the ceremonial deities. District officials from the Medical and Health department, deployed in the villages around, treated the injured immediately.

BJP State president Somu Veerraju has said that both the YSRCP and the TDP have belied the expectations of the people on Amaravati, whereas the Central government has made a significant contribution to the development of the State by sanctioning many projects.

Addressing the media here on Monday, Mr. Veerraju said the BJP’s stand on the capital was very clear and it was committed to the establishment of the High Court in Rayalaseema.

“The YSRCP government has neglected many projects undertaken by the previous dispensation. Both the YSRCP and TDP governments are mired in corruption. The BJP will expose the alleged complicity of the YSRCP MLAs in irregularities in 21 projects sponsored by the Central government,” he said.

He insisted that TDP national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu should give the details of the financial assistance extended by the Centre for the development of Amaravati.

“The YSRCP government too failed to translate its words into deeds. The Centre has sanctioned several infrastructure projects keeping in view the help which the State needed after bifurcation,” he said.

‘TTD funds being diverted’

The BJP leader demanded that the government should refrain from diverting the funds belonging to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD). The BJP has already written a letter to the government, he said.

“There are many issues in which the government owes an explanation to the public,” Mr. Veerraju said, adding that the BJP and the JSP would soon stage protests to protect people’s interests.

86,2020/10/27,Ashok Gajapathi Raju’s family to stay away from Sirimanotsavam,"The festival will be held without participation of devotees today

Former Union Minister Pusapati Ashok Gajapathi Raju’s family has decided to stay away from the direct participation in the ‘Sirimanotsavam’, scheduled to be organised on Tuesday. Mr. Ashok used to offer prayers on the occasion of ‘Tolellu’ and the Sirimanotsavam of Pyditalli Ammavaru till last year when he was the chairperson of the MANSAS Trust.

The deity is believed to be the incarnation of Pydimamba who, the legends says, had sacrificed her life by jumping into the Pedda Cheruvu after hearing the death news of her brother Peda Vijayarama Gajapathi Raju in the Bobbili war in 1757.

MANSAS Trust row

Mr. Ashok and his family members are unhappy with the reported priority being given to MANSAS Trust chairperson Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju, daughter of Uma Gajapathi Raju, the first wife of Mr. Ashok’s elder brother late Ananda Gajapathi Raju. Ms. Sanchaita offered prayers at the Pyditalli Ammavaru temple on Monday morning.

“I would have a virtual darshan. I am not expecting any special respect from the temple authorities. As per tradition, the male heir of the Pusapati royal family used to play a key role in the Sirimanotsavam and the temple affairs,” Mr. Ashok told the media here.

The appointment of Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju the MANSAS Trust chairperson and the removal of Mr. Ashok from the post without any prior notice may have an affect on the festival.

Mr. Ashok, along with his wife Suneela Gajapathi Raju and daughter Aditi Gajapathi Raju, would watch the the Sirimanotsavam from the Vizianagaram fort every year. However, they would not participate this year, even as they have got an invitation from the temple authorities.

Meanwhile, the State government haws made all arrangements for the festival. Usually, around 3 lakh people from different parts of the State participate in the event every year. But this time, the devotees will be not be allowed to take part in the festival, due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal on Modnay went to Hukumpet where the ‘Siri Manu’ was being decorated. Visakhapatnam Range DIG L.V.K. Ranga Rao, SP B. Rajakumari said that the restrictions would remain in force till the end of the festival.

The APSRTC has not been allowed to operate buses from other places this time.

87,2020/10/27,Centre should bear entire cost of Polavaram project: Minister,"‘The State government is only playing the role of a facilitator’

Irrigation Minister P. Anil Kumar Yadav on Monday said that the TDP was responsible for capping of the cost of the Polavaram Project at ₹20,399 crore by the Centre and the party should apologise to the people of the State for it.

“'There is no question of compromise on the issue. It is the responsibility of the Centre to fund the entire project cost, including the rehabilitation of the displaced persons. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy will write to the Centre and meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi shortly with facts and figures to press the State’s case,” the Minister told the media at Tadepalli on Monday.

Dig at TDP

The State government is only playing the role of a facilitator in constructing the project. If the construction cost goes up, it is the responsibility of the Centre to bear it and there can be no two opinion on this, he explained.

“It was the Centre’s responsibility to construct the project as per the A.P. State Reorganisation Act. Why then Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu government took over the project,” he asked.

Revised estimates

The TDP owes an apology to the people of the State for not dissenting though it was part of the BJP-led NDA at the Centre, when the irrigation component of the project cost was capped by the Union Cabinet in March 2017 as per the revised estimates for 2014. The YSRCP, which was in the Opposition then, had raised objections, the Minister pointed out.

“When the total project cost, after being considered by the Polavaram Project Authority and approved by the Central Water Commission, was put at ₹55,450 crore at the 2017-18 price level, how did the then Chief Minister agreed to ₹20,399 crore,” he asked.

Special package

It is natural that the estimated cost goes up over time in the case of a big project such as Polavaram. “However, it was unfortunate that then TDP government had agreed for the Special package announced by the Centre and hailed it through a resolution passed in the State Assembly, instead of insisting upon the Centre to bear the entire project cost as assured by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the floors of the Rajya Sabha at the time of State bifurcation,” said Mr. Anil Kumar.

Mr. Naidu, who went to Polavaram to review the progress of the irrigation component of the project on Mondays, did not take any interest on the issue of rehabilitation over one lakh people displaced, said the Minister, adding that the TDP regime had neglected the project by spending only ₹265 crore between 2014 and 2016.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/hsd7lh/article30656854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26VJPG4-ANILKUMARYADAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/centre-should-bear-entire-cost-of-polavaram-project-minister/article32948518.ece

Officials informed the Chief Minister that seven companies including some multinational companies had evinced interest in setting up the plant, and it would take at least seven weeks to select a qualified bidder. A target has been set to start the construction works in a month after that.

Electronic cluster

Taking stock of the development of the Kopparthy Electronic Manufacturing Cluster (EMC) in Kadapa district, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said a top priority should be accorded to it keeping in view the prospects of large-scale employment the project offered.

Officials said the consumer electronics maker Dixon Technologies had proposed to set up its manufacturing unit in the cluster at an investment of ₹300 crore. Some other companies were also keen on investing in the Kopparthy EMC.

Telugu Desam Party national general secretary Nara Lokesh has alleged that the State government has failed in rescuing farmers from floods and claimed that about 750 ryots committed suicide after the YSR Congress Party came to power.

Mr. Lokesh, who toured Krishna district to inspect the crops damaged due to floods on Monday, criticised the government for not coming to the rescue of the farmers whose crops were inundated in floods and suffered huge losses. Cotton, paddy, chilli, horticulture and aquaculture crops, worth crores of rupees, were damaged due to heavy rains that lashed in the last one month, he said.

The former Minister walked into the fields and observed the damage suffered by the crops in the island villages on the Krishna and West Godavari district borders.

While the TDP government had completed 70% of the Polavaram project, the YSRCP government could not take up any construction work in the last 17 months but had mortgaged the national project with the Centre for Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s self interests, the TDP leader alleged.

Instead of helping the farmers in distress, the Ministers were insulting them and even ration was not being supplied to flood victims, Mr. Lokesh said as he interacted with paddy farmers. The villagers showed him the crops soaked in the floodwater that stagnated in the fields for 15 days.

Loss assessment

The aquaculture farmers, who invested about ₹5 lakh per acre, suffered huge losses due to the floods, but government had not yet started the enumeration process, Mr. Lokesh alleged.

“How can the YSRCP government claim itself as Rythu Rajyam, when the farmers were weeping with losses?” he questioned and demanded that the government take measures to bail them out of losses.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jagan-mortgaging-polavaram-with-centre-for-self-interests-alleges-lokesh/article32948462.ece

96,2020/10/27,CREDAI urges govt. to check sale of sand in ‘grey’ market,"‘Issues in bulk online orders need to be resolved’

Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India’s AP State chapter general secretary K. Subhash Chandra Bose has urged the government to control the sale of sand in grey market and ensure hassle-free supply to revive construction activity in the State.

He expressed concern over the sale of sand at exorbitant rates in black market in the North Andhra region and other parts of the State. Mr. Bose, the managing director of Pride Developers and Constructions, Vizianagaram said that the entire economic chain and construction activity were badly affected in the State. “Hundreds of projects under construction in the 13 districts were stalled due to the non-availability of sand. “A lorry load of sand costs around ₹12,000 as per the government rates but it is being sold at ₹30,000, which is a huge burden on buyers,” he said and urged the government to take stringent measures to check black marketing of sand.

Workers badly hit

“Apart from builders, 17 lakh labourers lost their livelihood. Many labourers who returned to their native places during the lockdown period are eagerly waiting for works to resume. That is why, CREDAI has sent a detailed letter, requesting the government to resolve sand problem and other issues immediately,” said Mr. Bose.

“Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has introduced a good sand policy to streamline the rates and supply but its implementation at the ground level needs to be improved,” he added.

Online booking

According to him, CREDAI sought the attention of AP Mineral Development Corporation over technical glitches in online submission of bulk orders. The portal allows booking only at a particular time in the day and offers a limited quantity of sand at different locations. The stock is exhausted within minutes of opening of the website, he said, adding the government has to ensure supply of sand from nearby reaches to avoid huge transport charges.

Non-availability of fine quality sand is another concern for the construction industry.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/9g35ft/article32948226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27VJCREDAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/credai-urges-govt-to-check-sale-of-sand-in-grey-market/article32948227.ece

East Godavari Collector D. Muralidhar on Monday directed the AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) and district authorities to gather 20 acres to develop tourism infrastructure in Konaseema and Maredumilli forest cover in Rampa Agency in East Godavari district.

In an online meeting of the District Tourism Development Council, Mr. Muralidhar said the existing tourism facility centres at Adurru and Pasarlapudi should be renovated to put them into use in the Konaseema area.

The officials concerned, including the APTDC, have been told to prepare an action plan to convert the Havelock Bridge across river Godavari in Rajamahendravaram city into a tourist destination. The Indian Railways has in principle recently consented to handover the bridge to the State government for tourism purpose.

“The Environment Education Centre (EEC) built by the APTDC at the Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary should be handed over to the AP Forest Department to utilize the available infrastructure for the promotion of the tourism in the sanctuary,” said Mr. Muralidhar. The EEC was built in recent years with the special grant sanctioned by the Union Ministry of Tourism.

Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA- Rampachodavaram) Praveen Adithya and ITDA Chintoor Project Officer A. Venkata Ramana have been directed to explore the tourism potential in the Agency, with focus on tribal tourism.

99,2020/10/27,Corruption rife in govt. hospitals: Cong.,"‘Conditions at Govt. Children’s Hospital in Tirupati deplorable’

Cadres of the Congress party on Monday alleged that several thousands of files pertaining to public health matters were pending at the medical and health department at Amaravati, leading to lack of supervision and corruption in government hospitals.

The party activists led by All India Congress Committee member K. Prameelamma and State SC cell convener P. Prabhkar staged a protest in front of the Government Children’s Hospital in Tirupati demanding immediate solution to the public health issues.

The Congress leaders alleged that though a 300-bed exclusive children’s hospital was set up in Tirupati during the UPA government, lack of supervision and funds led to its getting almost defunct over years. They alleged that though over a hundred patients visit the hospital daily, it is not in a position to treat them, forcing the parents to approach private hospitals. In spite of the presence of medical and surgical specialist, the hospital is hit by acute shortage of medicines.

They deplored that though 25% percent of the people in Tirupati were affected with coronavirus, the government was playing down the figures, besides initiating risky treatment to patients through sanitary workers. The Congress leaders also alleged corruption in SVIMS and SVRR Hospitals, throwing public health of the poor and downtrodden in jeopardy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/5p0u9i/article32948026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27VJCORRUPTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/corruption-rife-in-govt-hospitals-cong/article32948027.ece

101,2020/10/27,We have come together to work for the BJP: Munirathna,"The leader, who shifted loyalties from Congress to BJP, claims old rivalries have been sunk

Munirathna had to win a legal battle waged by a BJP leader, challenging his 2018 election from the Congress on grounds of malpractice, before facing the people of Rajarajeshwarinagar again this time from the BJP. While others who changed loyalties and joined the BJP with him faced the bypolls 10 months ago, he had to wait longer for the legal hurdle to be cleared after he faced disqualification as MLA in July 2019.

The Hindu caught up with him on the campaign trail. Excerpts:

How do you justify your defection to BJP and this bypoll?

Congress MLAs got a raw deal from the coalition government. I was nominated as chairman for Karnataka Skill Development Corporation, but was not allowed to take charge. What upset me more was that our development works were held up. Tumakuru Road has a bottleneck at Goraguntepalya, which I sought to get fixed. I ran from pillar to post for a year between the JD(S) and the Congress leadership, but to no avail. Why should we be part of a government where even development work is put on hold? The Congress seemed neither prepared to sit in the Opposition nor was in power. So, as MLAs we had to prepare ourselves for five years of such stalemate or defect to the BJP, bring in a change of regime, which we did.

How has shifting to BJP helped development works in R.R. Nagar?

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has sanctioned grants to the tune of ₹960 crore for R.R. Nagar constituency alone. This includes several infrastructure works, but mainly the elevated corridor project that passes through the constituency. My dream is to build a Namma Metro line from Mysuru Road to Hebbal via Outer Ring Road. The Chief Minister has shown interest in the proposal.

You have had troubled relationships with most of BJP leaders, including Tulasi Muniraju Gowda and former councillors. Will this affect your prospects?

A man makes mistakes, sometimes because of wrong advice and sometimes prejudice. But we should forgive and forget. We have now all come together and are working for the BJP, not Munirathna. The BJP is a disciplined party where no man is larger than the party.

You are facing a candidate new to politics. Do you think her clean image will affect you?

I will not speak against Kusuma as she is a novice in politics and has never contested elections before. I respect her. But, I have a track record of development and work to show, which she doesn’t.

Would you demand to be made Minister, if you win this bypoll?

What I will say is not important. The CM and party high command will decide.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/96dgp7/article32958144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGMUNIRATNAMEDIACONFERENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/we-have-come-together-to-work-for-the-bjp/article32958145.ece

103,2020/10/27,Mysuru to remain partially illuminated till November 1,"Though the scaled-down Dasara celebrations concluded on Monday, with the Vijayadashami procession restricted to the Mysuru palace premises, the main thoroughfares of the city will remain illuminated till November 1.

A senior official of Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation told The Hindu that the illumination of Raja Marg (or the royal path) — starting from Mysuru palace and passing through K.R. Circle and Sayyaji Rao Road — will be continued till November 1. Illumination of the remaining parts of the city will be discontinued.

The dazzling lights adorning the streets of Mysuru is one of the major attractions during Dasara. However, the government had scaled down the illumination from 100 km of roads last year to just 50 km this year in view of the decision to keep the celebrations simple during times of COVID-19.

With most of the Dasara programmes cancelled, the illumination of the roads in Mysuru’s core heritage zone around the palace was among the only attractions this year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-to-remain-partially-illuminated-till-november-1/article32957958.ece
104,2020/10/27,Three rare literary works released in Mysuru,"The Oriental Research Institute (ORI) in the city, which is a treasure trove of ancient manuscripts, released three books as part of its efforts to make some of the rare literary works available to the public at low prices.

The books were released by G. Hemantha Kumar, Vice-Chancellor, University of Mysore, under which the ORI functions. Of the three, Manushastravivaranam is reckoned to be a translation from one of the earliest manuscripts, which is dated 8th Century CE, according to ORI director S. Shivarajappa. The second work is titled Khadga Shastra and the third is relatively recent and pertains to Mummadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar. The original work is dated 19th century and is titled Srimatkrishnarajagunaloka, said Mr. Shivarajappa.

Khadga Shastra throws light on the arms and weaponry of ancient India, while the work on Wadiyar is a study of the Mysuru ruler and his taste for literature, culture, and art.

Prof. Shivarajappa said this is part of the ORI’s ongoing efforts to make available at low cost some rare works to scholars and students of Indian history, culture and arts, apart from members of the public who may have interest in these subjects.

The ORI since its inception has published 225 rare works and there are six more ready for release within the next fortnight.

105,2020/10/27,Details of Dasara expenditure will be released by November 1: Minister,"S.T. Somashekar told reporters that the State government had sanctioned ₹15 crore for the Dasara celebrations, which included ₹5 crore from Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA).

The details of the expenditure incurred by the State government on Dasara celebrations will be released by November 1, said S.T. Somashekar, Minister in charge of Mysuru district, on Tuesday

Mr. Somashekar, who is also the Minister for Cooperation, told reporters in Mysuru that the State government had sanctioned ₹15 crore for the Dasara celebrations, which included ₹5 crore from Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA). But, all the expenses came under the ₹10 crore sanctioned by the government, and the MUDA fund was not utilised, he said. “The breakup will be released by November 1,” he added.

With the government deciding to scale down the celebrations and keep them simple in view of COVID-19, he said the number of elephants participating in the Dasara festivities had been brought down to just five instead of the 12 to 15.

Similarly, he said the illumination of roads too was considerably reduced. Instead of about 100 km, only about 50 km of roads in the city were illuminated this year.

This year’s Dasara programmes were restricted to Chamundi Hills and Mysuru palace, and the number of people gathering for the events was within the numbers fixed by the technical advisory committee on COVID-19.

Though the number of people at the Dasara programme venues atop Chamundi Hills and Mysuru palace was limited this year, Mr. Somashekar claimed lakhs had watched the programmes virtually, through Doordarshan, Facebook, YouTube, private television channels, and social media.

A large number of people watched the Jamboo Savari, which had been confined to the palace premises on Monday, on the Facebook page of the Department of Information and Public Relation.

The Dasara programmes webcast on the Facebook page alone recorded six lakh views, Mr. Somashekar said. This was in addition to the lakhs of views on the links provided by different media houses, he added.

Though the Dasara festivities remained simple, the festival was celebrated in a meaningful manner with cardiologist C.N. Manjunath inaugurating the festivities atop Chamundi Hills, while corona warriors, including a pourakarmika, an ASHA, a police personnel, a health officer, and a social activist, were felicitated.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/g9k9j9/article32957937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGMYSELEPHANTCHILLING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/details-of-dasara-expenditure-will-be-released-by-november-1-minister/article32957938.ece
106,2020/10/27,A pilot project commissioned for better railway communication,"Mysuru Division of South Western Railway (SWR) is implementing a pilot project to enhance the quality of the communication network linking controllers and station masters, paving the way for greater safety.

The pilot project is being implemented in three railway divisions across India, and Mysuru is the first off the block to commission it. Based on the progress, the Voice over Internet Protocol-based Train Control Communication System (TCCS) is to be implemented in all railway divisions across the country.

The authorities said train traffic control communication between the Divisional Control Office and station masters at the wayside stations is vital for safe and efficient train operations. To strengthen it, the Ministry of Railways decided to commission a VoIP-based TCCS in one controlled section in each of South Western, Central, and North Western railways where the OFC system is available.

This scheme is being operationalised over the Mysuru Division of SWR between Birur Junction and Sampige Road and Hassan Junction and Arsikere Junction, covering 18 stations over a distance of 150 km.

The rail authorities said the distinct advantages of TCCS include better call quality, less noise, facilitating monitoring up to the endpoint, and adapting future technology upgrades in an existing system at a relatively low cost. Each controller has nearly 30 station masters with whom there is constant communication through conference calls, but the signals tend to be weak or accompanied by noise, which adds to stress. But the new system eliminates the noise to provide for better audio reception.

The new communication system was inaugurated last week in Mysuru by Ajay Kumar Singh, General Manager, SWR, Hubballi. D. Sreenivasulu, Senior Divisional Signal and Telecommunication Officer, SWR, Mysuru Division, led the technical team in harnessing this state-of-the-art technological tool in communications to pave the way for enhanced safety margins in train operations, said the authorities.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a-pilot-project-commissioned-for-better-railway-communication/article32957868.ece
107,2020/10/27,Hukkeri’s statement continues to draw reactions in Belagavi,"Congress leader Prakash Hukkeri’s statement that he would campaign for the BJP if it were to field a member of the Suresh Angadi family in the Lok Sabha bypoll continued to draw reactions in Belagavi on Tuesday.

Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee working president Satish Jarkiholi asked Mr. Hukkeri to introspect on his stand. “I don’t think it is right for such a senior Congress leader to speak of supporting the BJP,” he added.

He is among the senior most Congress leaders in the State and has enjoyed a series of posts from being a member of the zilla panchayat to Parliament. He should reflect on his statements, Mr. Jarkiholi told journalists.

He said that it was natural for a political party to witness internal fights. The BJP is not immune to it. “Their internal fights are bigger than ours,” he said.

“His statement has come as a surprise. Let us see; nothing is going to change immediately. I have no idea about what our high command plans to do about it,” he said.

To a question, he said that he would not raise the issue before the party senior leaders, to ask them either to punish Mr. Hukkeri or to favour him.

Meanwhile, Ramesh Jarkiholi, district in-charge Minister and BJP leader, said that he would want to understand why Mr. Hukkeri made such a statement, before he made any comments on it. “However, at a personal level, he is my good friend. I would not want to politicise the issue,” he said.

To a question, he said that he would not invite Mr. Hukkeri to the party but would leave such decisions to the party high command.

BJP leader and former Minister Umesh Katti said that Mr. Hukkeri should try to build a consensus towards ensuring the election of a BJP candidate from Belagavi, without laying conditions, including a member of the Angadi family getting ticket. Mr. Hukkeri should request the Congress leadership not to contest the Belagavi seat, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hukkeris-statement-continues-to-draw-reactions-in-belagavi/article32956974.ece
108,2020/10/27,Royal Dasara: Continuing a tradition amidst pandemic,"Though a battery of priests under the guidance of Dharmadhikaris supervise the rituals every year, their numbers were reduced this time

The low-key Dasara of the Wadiyars held under the cloud of the pandemic concluded with the ‘victory procession’ taken out in the presence of a few select invitees but devoid of the usual paraphernalia, at the palace premises here on Monday.

The religious rites associated with Navaratri were conducted over the last 10 days amidst the imperatives of maintaining social distancing.

Though a battery of priests under the guidance of Dharmadhikaris supervised the rituals, their numbers were reduced this year in view of the pandemic and it was entirely a private affair.

Though the Khas Durbar is devoid of any significance after the abolition of the privy purse, it is conducted for 10 days in what is a throw back to a bygone era and was no different this year. It entails the current titular king Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar ascending the golden throne in the presence of the courtiers dressed in Stately attire. A large crowd, mainly invitees, witness the proceedings during Navaratri but this year the palace was out of bounds to the invitees as well and it remained a low-key affair.

Another practice of the bygone era held during the Navaratri used to be Vajra Musthi Kalaga in which the wrestlers wearing knuckledusters with spikes, engage each other and whosoever draws first blood was declared the winner.

But this form of wrestling which has long gone extinct and conducted only during the Navaratri, was dropped this year due to the pandemic. The wrestling bout used to attract people in hundreds and posed challenges in ensuring social distancing.

The last day of Dasara saw the culmination of the rites with special prayers to the Banni tree performed by Yaduveer. The ‘vijaya yatre’ (victory procession) entailed a visit to the Bhuvaneshwari temple accompanied by the caparisoned elephants, the royal cow and the royal horse in the backdrop of traditional music played by an ensemble of musicians.

Though held far from the public gaze and the media spotlight, the private Dasara of the Wadiyars marked the continuation of the tradition started by Raja Wadiyar on ascending the throne at Srirangapatana in 1610 CE. This is also the link to the Navaratri as celebrated by the rulers of the Vijayanagar empire and inherited by the Wadiyars of Mysuru.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/di1tgp/article32948489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGMYSURUWADIYAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/royal-dasara-continuing-a-tradition-amidst-pandemic/article32948490.ece

The books were released by Minister for Tourism C.T. Ravi and the District in-charge Minister S.T. Somashekar. Mr. Ravi said history based on empirical evidence was imperative to understand the past. He said it will also dispel, what he termed as ‘false history’ and called for greater research and field work. The Minister said the education system introduced by Thomas Macaulay has failed to throw light on the scientific achievements of ancient India. Nor has any effort been made to project the valour of Indians and it is ironic that the country still pursues the same educational system.

India’s achievements

Mr. Ravi said there was widespread belief that science and technology originated in Europe.

With the procession confined to the Mysuru palace premises in view of the decision taken to keep Dasara celebrations simple and low-key on account of COVID-19, many shops and commercial establishments on Sayyaji Rao Road remained open and carried out their business as usual.

The Torch Light parade grounds, which used to be out of bounds on Vijayadashami Day, had turned into a playground on Monday for youngsters to play cricket.

With the district administration banning entry of the general public into the palace premises, the roads leading to the entrances were barricaded from all sides, which also led to the blocking of entry to City Bus stand.

Buses operating

The buses, however, operated from Agrahara, Ramaswamy Circle, Dasappa Circle, Five Lights Circle and Gun House Circle. The Suburban bus stand, however, was operational.

However, a few people from nearby villages including a few youth were trying to gain entry into the Palace premises from the Southern Gate. Their efforts were thwarted by the police. Barricades had been put up near Sayyaji Rao Road, Gun House Circle and Chamaraja Circle, which led to the Palace.

Restaurants open

It was a rare sight to find many hotels and restaurants, besides textile shops on Sayyaji Rao Road remaining open and catering to the customers on Vijayadashami. Pavement hawkers too put up their wares and carried out business as usual on the road. However, a few establishments had downed their shutters on Monday.

Many shops on adjoining D. Devaraj Urs and Dhanvantri Roads too remained open. However, a large number of people flocked the roads in the evening to enjoy the sight of the illuminated roads and circles.

Protesters arrested

Meanwhile, activist Vatal Nagaraj, who had opposed the government’s decision to restrict the Dasara celebrations, was arrested along with his supporters when they turned up at the Silver Jubilee Clock Tower, also known as Dodda Gadiyara, on Ashoka Road to take out their own procession of Chamundeshwari with a portrait of the deity on a chariot.

Yediyurappa has failed to handle the flood situation in Kalyan Karnataka and has not announced any compensation after his recent aerial survey to assess the loss caused by floods in Yadgir and Kalaburagi districts, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah has said.

He was addressing a press conference in Yadgir after visiting flood-hit Hurasagundagi and Roja villages in Shahapur taluk on Monday.

Mr. Siddaramaiah, who visited flood-hit areas in Bidar and Kalaburagi districts before coming to Yadgir, said that “Yadgir district suffered a crop loss in 24,000 hectares in rain in September. Now, in October, it is said that the crops in 45,000 hectares may have been lost in rain. In all, crops in 69,000 hectares have been lost. However, not a single paisa of compensation has been announced for the district.”

He also said that the Revenue Minister and district in-charge Minister paid namesake visits to the flood- hit areas in the district. The State government has availed itself of ₹ 1.30 lakh crore loan. It could have used the amount as compensation for flood and rain victims. But, it did not. It used ₹ 4,200 crore to tackle COVID-19. Where is the remaining amount? he asked and added that the government is involved in rampant corruption.

Terming the BJP government as the most corrupt, he said that “then, Mr. Yediyurappa had taken bribe through cheque. Now, his son is taking bribe through RTGS. We were reiterating that administration should be transparent but these people have made corruption transparent.” He said that the government has become bankrupt and has no money to release compensation.

Mr. Siddaramaiah also said that the Congress will move court against corruption in the purchase of COVID-19 equipment as “our demand for a judicial inquiry under the supervision of a Supreme Court judge has not been considered”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5p6jke/article32948400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGYADGIRFLOODS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/crops-on-69000-hectares-of-land-in-all-lost-in-yadgir-district/article32948401.ece
112,2020/10/27,"‘We need to increase our strength in Legislative Councils, Rajya Sabha’","Congress is disrespecting people’s mandate as it does not believe in democracy: Pralhad Joshi

Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi has said that considering the disrespect of people’s mandate by the Congress, it has become politically important to increase the party’s numbers in the Legislative Councils and also in the Rajya Sabha.

Addressing presspersons along with Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar in Hubblali on Monday, Mr. Joshi said: “The Congress does not believe in democracy. As an Opposition party it should respect the mandate of the people and allow the government to work according to what it has promised to the people of the State. However, as the Congress and the Opposition parties have more strength in the Legislative Councils and in the Rajya Sabha, they are stalling important legislation of the governments,” he said.

Considering the disrespect of the Congress to democracy, now it has become crucial for the BJP to increase the number of its representatives in the Legislative Councils, he said and added that it was now time for people to show the Congress its place.

Referring to the pandemonium created by the Congress and the Opposition parties during the tabling of the farm Bills, Mr. Joshi said that the Congress believed that it was born to rule and now it could not digest the fact that it has been unseated from power.

“The mentality of the Congress is that whenever there is a crisis in that party, its leaders tried to project it as if it was a crisis for the country. It is time to show the Congress its place,” he said.

Terming Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s statement on Indo-China conflict, Mr. Joshi said that Mr. Rahul Gandhi was issuing foolish and illogical statements and his own partymen disagreed with them.

He said that they were confident of winning all the four Council seats and the two bypolls to the Assembly.

113,2020/10/27,Jamboo Savari confined to palace for third time in 25 years,"This is not the first time Jamboo Savari in Mysuru has been limited to the Mysuru palace premises. The Vijayadashami procession was confined within Amba Vilas Palace in the past instead of the usual itinerary on the streets of Mysuru.

The pneumonic plague had struck parts of Surat in Gujarat in 1994 and the Government of Karnataka led by then Chief Minister M. Veerappa Moily decided to scale down the procession, confining the grand spectacle to the palace premises. The decision was taken as a preventive measure to contain the spread of plague since the Dasara finale used to attract tens of thousands of people from various parts of the country.

In 2002, eight years later, the Jamboo Savari was again restricted to the palace in the wake of severe drought besides former Minister H. Nagappa’s kidnap by forest brigand Veerappan. Then Chief Minister S.M. Krishna decided to keep Dasara procession simple since his government was facing many issues with the State in the grip of successive droughts.

This is the third time in a span of two and half decades that the procession was limited to the palace with the grand spectacle that usually accompanies the celebrations missing.

The erstwhile Mysuru royal family too had kept the celebrations simple and by and large it was a family affair with no visitors and invitees to witness the family’s centuries’-old Dasara rituals. The number of elephants too was less this year with only five jumbos led by Abhimanyu.

This year, the challenge faced by all those associated with the Dasara festivities was keeping the key staff at the venue COVID-19 free as the pandemic was posing a serious health risk even as Mysuru was reporting second highest cases in the State after Bengaluru and was also a COVID-19 hotspot. Keeping the elephants, mahouts and the staff safe from COVID-19 was a test which the forest officials successfully handled, taking all precautions like not allowing the key staff venture out of the palace fort, providing them with all essentials, and screening them periodically along with COVID-19 tests so that they remained fit and healthy for the occasion.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qw6p39/article32948276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGMYSURUABHIMANYU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jamboo-savari-confined-to-palace-for-third-time-in-25-years/article32948277.ece
114,2020/10/27,Restoration of damaged infrastructure to be launched soon,"Works worth a total ₹230 crore have been approved for Hubballi-Dharwad, says Industries and district in-charge Minister Jagadish Shettar

Minister for Large and Medium Industries and Dharwad district in-charge Jagadish Shettar has said that after the restrictions under the poll code of conduct were relaxed, works pertaining to restoration of damaged infrastructure would be launched.

Addressing presspersons here on Monday, Mr. Shettar said that the natural calamity had caused lot of damage across the State and there was a need for restoration of infrastructure. “However, because of the COVID-19-induced lockdown and financial constraints, funds under the Chief Minister’s Nagarotthana Yojane were not released for works, including those pertaining to Hubballi-Dharwad. Although the Finance Department had given permission, it was held back due to the announcement of poll code,” he said

Mr. Shettar said that under the Nagarotthana Yojane, approval had been given for the release of ₹ 150 crore infrastructure development in Hubballi-Dharwad alone.

“The Hubballi Dharwad Municipal Corporation will get ₹ 150 crore under the Nagarotthana Yojane and ₹ 50 crore under the 15th Finance Commission. This apart, it will get ₹ 30 crore under general funds. Once the poll code of conduct is withdrawn, the tender process will start, probably, by November first week,” he said.

The Minister said that all steps were being taken to generate employment by promoting industrial development, and amid the COVID-19 situation, the State had received good investment proposals which was 42 % of the investment proposals in the country. Setting up of new industries would generate employment for youths, including graduates, and the government was working towards making the State more investment-friendly, he said.

Regarding the BJP promise for stipend for unemployed youths, Mr. Shettar said that the party would work on it. As much time was spent fighting COVID-19, the BJP government would look into it now. But, meanwhile, the focus was also on employment generation, he added.

Taking a dig at the Congress for its allegations against the BJP government in the State, Mr. Shettar said that at a time when the Chief Minister’s post was not vacant, the Congress leaders were fight among themselves for occupying that coveted post.

Already, across the nation, the Congress was in a very sorry state and post the Bihar elections and the bypolls in Karnataka, that party would go into a coma, he said.

Mr. Shettar said that the BJP had systematically worked for the council elections and would win all the four Council seats. “Such has been the preparation that for every 20 voters in the Council elections, there is one party worker who will coordinate with them till they exercised their franchise. We will win comfortably for the work we have done,” he said.

115,2020/10/27,Special Assembly session sought to discuss consequences of floods,"‘Farmers have lost standing crops and thousands have become homeless’

The former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah has sought the convening of a special Assembly session to discuss the consequences of heavy rain and floods in the State in the last three months.

Addressing a press conference in Kalaburagi on Monday, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that the life of flood-hit people has come to a grinding halt. Farmers have lost their standing crops and thousands of families in rural areas have become homeless overnight due to heavy rain and floods.

In this case, convening an Assembly session would be appropriate to discuss the problems of the flood victims and the relief measures taken.

He accused the State and the Union governments of not releasing compensation to the flood-affected people. He also pointed out that the victims of last year’s floods have not yet received compensation for their loss.

He criticised Deputy Chief Minister and district in-charge of Kalaburagi Govind Karjol for not visiting the flood-hit villages in the district.

Mr. Karjol has not visited Kalaburagi for the last five months, he said and added that this shows the lackadaisical attitude of the Minister towards the flood victims.

Criticising Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s aerial survey of the flood-affected areas, he said that “through aerial survey, you cannot understand the pain of the affected people. When the flood victims in these districts were waiting to meet the Chief Minister, why did Mr. Yediyurappa not visit a single village and meet the affected people.”

Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of showing step-motherly attitude towards the State, he said that Mr. Modi had toured Bihar when that State was grappling with floods and immediately released financial assistance.

But he [Mr. Modi] neither visited Karnataka nor released financial assistance to take up relief measures, he added.

Damage and loss

The initial estimates have put the loss due to heavy rain and floods in the district at ₹ 700 crore — agriculture crop loss estimated to ₹ 100 crore, damage to roads, bridges and check-dams estimated at ₹ 360 crore and damage to houses and government buildings estimated at ₹ 240 crore.

This estimation may go up four times after the actual damage is surveyed, he added. Mr. Siddaramaiah visited Saradagi and Katti Sangavi villages of Jewargi taluk and interacted with the flood victims.

116,2020/10/27,Three men rounded up for questioning in murder case,"A habitual offender was hacked to death in Belagavi

The police have rounded up three persons for questioning in the murder of a repeat offender in Gangawadi in Belagavi on Sunday night.

The three were rounded up from some villages surrounding the city, a police officer said.

He is part of a team that is investigating the murder of Shahabaz Khan (24), who was facing several criminal cases.

He also faced charges in some serious crimes and the police had included his name in the list of repeat offenders.

A gang of four or five persons attacked him when he was leaning over his motorcycle near a hospital in Gangawadi.

Eyewitness accounts told the police that Shahabaz Khan ran towards the residence of a former Deputy Superintendent of Police who is living in the neighbourhood after his retirement.

However, the assailants gained speed upon their target and hacked him near the officer’s house.

He was bleeding profusely when the police shifted him to the district hospital with help from local residents. He died in a few minutes as he had been grievously wounded.

The police suspected that a long-standing dispute over money could have led to the attack.

The police said that Shahabaz Khan went into hiding after attacking two persons near a hotel in Kakati. There were rumours that he was hiding in Goa and that he had returned to Belagavi in the recent months.

A case has been registered in the Mala Maruti Police Station. Deputy Commissioner of Police Vikram Amate has constituted a team of officers led by B.R. Gaddekar to apprehend the accused.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/three-men-rounded-up-for-questioning-in-murder-case/article32948224.ece
117,2020/10/27,Abhimanyu carries golden howdah with precision and ease,"The 54-year-old Abhimanyu pulled off the big task of carrying the 750 kg golden howdah in his maiden attempt with precision and ease at this year’s Jamboo Savari at the palace here on Monday.

Though he has been taking part in Mysuru Dasara for over 20 years now, the task of carrying the howdah was new. Known for its mastery in forest operations, Abhimanyu succeeded in seeing the job through with sheer stateliness, drawing accolades.

Impressively decorated as the lead elephant, Abhimanyu, who emerged as the successor to Arjuna - who turned 60 this year and was retired from the Dasara task after eight years of carrying the howdah with finesse and perfection, was the cynosure of all eyes at the Vijayadashami procession on Monday.

The good-natured jumbo waited for the artists to complete their embellishment on its trunk, head and legs. Four other elephants too were specially decorated being the star attractions of the event. Since its arrival here from the forest camp, Abhimanyu, who was the frontrunner when the Forest Department was looking for the successor to Arjuna, successfully underwent weight training so that it was fully prepared for the big day. When Arjuna was the lead elephant, Abhimanyu used to carry weights during the daily rehearsals as a stand-by and therefore the task was not that difficult for the tusker.

After the successful Dasara sojourn, the gentle giants – Abhimanyu, Vikrama, Gopi, Vijaya and Kaveri – are expected to return to their respective camps with their mahouts and kavadis for next year’s Dasara.

The Forest Department officials took special care and precautions for the jumbos and the administration has extended special gratitude to the mahouts and kavadis for their efforts in making it a successful Dasara.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2jxfpq/article32948210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGMYSURUHOWDAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/abhimanyu-carries-golden-howdah-with-precision-and-ease/article32948211.ece

Seventeen-year-old K.K. Radhika from Wayanad is in the limelight for cracking the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT), said to be the first among a particularly vulnerable tribal group (PVTG) in the country.

Radhika, elder daughter of Kariyan and Bindu of the Kallur Kunnu Kattunayakka tribal settlement at Valluvady, near Sulthan Bathery, is the only student who cracked the test among the PVTG group in the district this year.

Her father is a daily-wage worker and her mother is a worker under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.

“My teacher A.Vineetha, who is my mentor, informed me the result on Tuesday noon,” Radhika told The Hindu.

“I would do my best for the betterment of the marginalised sections of society, including my community, after the completion of my course,” she said.

The District Legal Services Authority and the Integrated Tribal Development Project (ITDP) provided three-month training for nine PVTG students, include six girls, to appear for the test.

The ITDP would bear all expenses for her higher studies and the programme would continue in the coming years too to bring the marginalised sections to the mainstream, K.C.

119,2020/10/27,Actor rape case: prosecution to move HC this week,"Seeking a change of court

The prosecution in the female actor rape case will move the Kerala High Court this weekend seeking a change of court, as it apprehends that justice may be denied to the victim if the trial is continued in the present court.

The prosecution may highlight what it terms as the hostile atmosphere in the trial court, the alleged procedural violations in the case, and the reported inappropriate conduct of the presiding officer of the court.

It may also list out the reported instance of bias on the part of the presiding officer against the prosecution. There have also been instances of violation of natural justice, according to sources.

The case is being tried at the Additional Special Sessions Court (SPE/CBI)-3, Ernakulam, for nearly three years. The Kerala High Court had deputed a woman judicial officer to try the case considering the plea of the victim. Actor Dileep, the eighth accused in the case, has been charged with conspiracy.

The trial in the abduction and rape case is being held in-camera and only the lawyers concerned, the investigation officer, and minimum number of court staff are permitted inside the court hall during the trial.

Some of the reported comments and remarks of the judicial officer against the prosecution in the court and discussing the contents of an anonymous letter may also figure in the petition. There were also reported conversations in the court on the possible outcome of the trial, which according to the prosecution, marred the hope of a fair trial.

The reported off-the-cuff remarks of the presiding officer in open court may also be brought to the notice of the higher judiciary, sources indicated.

At the same time, legal sources indicated that the directives of the Supreme Court and the High Court and the procedures as laid down by law were strictly followed in the case. Only those conversations permitted in the legal process took place in the court room, the sources indicated.

As the rift widened, A. Sureshan, the prosecutor in the case, sought time in the trial court for moving the Kerala High Court nearly 10 days ago. After waiting for about eight days for filing the petition, the trial court rejected the plea and ordered the resumption of trial on November 3.

Incidentally, the Supreme Court-fixed deadline for completing the trial will end on February 4, 2021.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/actor-rape-case-prosecution-to-move-hc-this-week/article32958038.ece
120,2020/10/27,Walayar case: ex-prosecutor takes on CM,"Police failed in building a strong case: Jalaja Madhavan

The former public prosecutor who represented the government in the sensational Walayar case involving the death of two minor sisters said here on Tuesday that the case had been too weak for any prosecution to get a conviction for the accused.

“The case had only circumstantial evidence, and no scientific evidence. Even if the case is reinvestigated, only the circumstantial evidence can be presented before the court. The police failed miserably in building a strong case by collecting pieces of evidence,” said Jalaja Madhavan, who had been public prosecutor for three months in the Walayar case.

Ms. Madhavan lashed out at Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for blaming the prosecution for the acquittal of the accused in the case. The Chief Minister had held the prosecution responsible for the failure of the case.

“The police built the case so weakly that no prosecution will be able to bring the culprits to book,” she said. “The Chief Minister should explain how the prosecution failed.”

Ms. Madhavan said she had pointed out to investigating officer M.J. Sojan (DySP) about the misreckoning of including ‘suicide’ in the first information report (FIR) in spite of having plenty of circumstantial evidence to make it a murder. The postmortem examination report too had mentioned that murder could not be ruled out.

“I told DySP Sojan about it, but he never cooperated,” she said. According to her, the former chairman of the Child Welfare Committee too refused to intervene for the victims. She demanded an investigation into their roles.

She said the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government replaced her with Lata Jayaraj, who had been appointed by the United Democratic Front (UDF) government. “I am a Left sympathiser. Still I don’t know why I was replaced by a UDF nominee. The Home Department should explain the reason for it,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2gb8x3/article32958672.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jalaja-Madhavan4---Copy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/walayar-case-ex-prosecutor-takes-on-cm/article32958010.ece
121,2020/10/27,"Now, a palliative care unit for big cats in Kerala","Unit in Wayanad following straying of tigers into settlements

The Forest and Wildlife Department is gearing up to set up an animal hospice and palliative care unit for big cats in Wayanad in view of the rise in cases of tigers straying into human settlements, especially in the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary.

The sanctuary is home to more than half the number of tigers present in Kerala.

The animal hospice and palliative care unit, the first such initiative in the State, will be set up in the Kurichiad range of forest under the sanctuary, Vijayananthan, Chief Conservator of Forest, Wildlife, Palakkad, said.

“We are planning to set up the unit on five acre on the premises of Vanalakshmi, an abandoned pepper plantation of the department, at Pachadi in the Kurichiad forest range at an estimate of ₹78 lakh,” he said.

“The unit will be a rehabilitation centre for major carnivores such as tigers and leopards and could hold four animals at a time,” he said.

Under the project, injured and diseased animals will be treated at the centre after capturing them. They will either be rehabilitated here or released into the wild after treatment. The construction works have already been tendered and awarded, Mr. Vijayananthan said adding that the project would be completed in three months.

Most of the felines that stray into human settlements are aged ones and will not be able to hunt prey in the wild in case the department lets them out into the forest. Keeping tigers in the custody of the Forest Department is a challenge as zoo authorities are bound by restrictions on keeping the captured felines in custody, he said.

The department has captured five tigers from Wayanad, including a nine-year-old tigress from a tribal settlement near Pulpally on Sunday, in the past two years after they strayed into settlements.

The tigress captured on Sunday is under observation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/s2uj90/article32957955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27tvwy2tiger3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-palliative-care-unit-for-big-cats-in-kerala/article32957954.ece
122,2020/10/27,Kerala government fixes base price for 16 agricultural produce,"The scheme is to protect farmers from price fluctuations, says Pinarayi Vijayan

The government expects to produce an additional one lakh tonnes of vegetables and tubers alike in a year, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Tuesday. A project would be prepared to ensure the best market for the produce.

Mr. Vijayan was speaking after announcing the base price for 16 agricultural items, including vegetables, fruits, and tubers, in what the government termed a first-of-its-kind initiative in the country, here. The scheme, designed to protect farmers from adverse price fluctuations, would come into effect from November 1.

Mr. Vijayan said the base price would provide relief and support to both traditional farmers and those newly farming the land. While farmers around the country were discontent and had taken up protests, the Kerala government supported them and rolled out several initiatives aimed at development of agriculture in the past four-and-a-half years. The base price was one such measure.

Sixteen agricultural produce would be covered in the first phase. Crops such as tapioca, ‘nendran’ plantain, pineapple, bitter gourd, cucumber, snake gourd, tomato, cabbage, and beans that were produced in the State had been included in the base price, which would be 20% above the production cost of the vegetable.

If the market price dipped below the base price of a vegetable, the produce would be procured at the base price and the money transferred to farmers’ accounts. The produce would be graded on quality, and the base price fixed on that basis. There was also a provision to revise the base price regularly, the Chief Minister said.

Local self-government institutions would have an important role to play in the scheme as they would coordinate the procurement and distribution of vegetables, he said.

The scheme would benefit a farmer with cultivation on a maximum of 15 acres in a season. They would have to register on the Agriculture Department’s registration portal after insuring the crop to get the benefit of the base price. The registration would begin on November 1.

Initially though, the registration would not be mandatory for farmers intending the procurement to happen through primary agricultural credit cooperative societies. The procured produce would be sold through the department’s markets or the societies’ marketing network. Any excess produce would be converted into value-added products. The scheme also envisaged setting up of supply chain process such as cold-storage facilities and refrigerated vehicles.

He pointed out that vegetable production in the State had more than doubled from 7 lakh tonnes to 14.72 lakh tonnes in the past four-and-a-half years. Area under paddy cultivation had increased from 1.96 lakh hectares to 2.15 lakh hectares. This was the result of schemes such as Subhiksha Keralam and Jeevani that had attracted non-residents Keralites who had returned home, women, and the youth.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fj9s57/article32726489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29KRAPINARAYIVIJAYAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-government-fixes-base-price-for-16-agricultural-produce/article32957834.ece

Thiruvananthapuram

Kerala’s COVID-19 case graph on Tuesday again remained sluggish, reflective of the low testing on Monday, which was a public holiday.

The State reported 5,457 cases on Tuesday when 46,193 samples were tested in the past 24 hours, with which the cumulative case burden of the State crossed the four-lakh mark, to touch 4,02,674 cases.

However, the backlog of the low testing and the proportionate lower burden of new cases in the past three or four days would probably get reflected in tomorrow’s case figures.

The State also recorded more recoveries than new cases on the day, discharging 7,015 patients from hospitals.

The test positivity rate, which had been hovering in the 12-14 % range, slid to 11.8% on Monday.

The cumulative recoveries in the State till date being 3,09,032 cases, the number of active cases at present in the State is 92,161. Of the active cases, 817 are critically ill and in ICUs with 200 patients requiring ventilator support.

The addition of 24 deaths pushed the State’s official COVID-19 toll to 1,376 cases. Thrissur reported six of these deaths, Ernakulam four, Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam three each, while Idukki, Palakkad, Malappuram and Kasaragod reported one case each.

Of the new cases reported on Monday, 98.3% or 5,369 cases are locally acquired infections, with the source of infection remaining unknown in 607 cases. The number of healthcare workers who contracted the infection amongst this is 60.

In the districts, Thrissur reported 730 cases, Ernakulam 716, Malappuram 706, Alapuzha 647, Kozhikode 597, Thiruvananthapuram 413, Kottayam 395, Palakkad 337, Kollam 329, Kannur 258, Pathanamthitta 112, Wayanad 103, Kasaragod 65, and Idukki 49 cases.

The active case pool in southern districts have gone down, especially in Thiruvananthapuram, where the number of active cases have dropped from over 12,000 cases to 8,587 cases.

129,2020/10/27,Deliberate bid to oust government: Kerala CM,"‘BJP trying to erase communist martyrs from history’

Deliberate attempts are being made to oust the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in the State, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

He was addressing the valedictory function of the week-long observance of the 74th anniversary of the Punnapra-Vayalar uprising on Tuesday.

“Attempts are being made to finish off the LDF government and weaken the left-secular front. The United Democratic Front (UDF) is engaged in anti-LDF activities. Both the Sangh Parivar and the Congress have joined hands to destroy the left front. The UDF, in a bid to strengthen its base, is bringing communal forces to its fold. It is joining forces with Islamic terrorism. The UDF has lost its credibility,” Mr. Vijayan said.

The Chief Minister said the BJP-led Union government was engaged in erasing part of the history of the country's independence struggle. Referring to the move to drop the Communist martyrs of Punnapra-Vayalar, Karivelloor and Kavumbayi agitations from the list of martyrs, Mr. Vijayan said it was an attempt to remove agitations led by communists and people belonging to the minority communities from the pages of history.

“Those trying to erase the history were not part of India's Independence struggle. They want to prevent the public from knowing who all took part in the freedom struggle,” he said.

Mr. Vijayan said the Constitution and parliamentary system was under attack. “The Centre is intruding into States jurisdiction. The latest example is the agriculture sector reform bills. The Congress party has failed to bring opposition parties together in the fight against the BJP government. Many of their leaders are deserting the party and joining the BJP,” the Chief Minister said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bkk0l9/article32959928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tval1--Punnapra-Vayalar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/deliberate-bid-to-oust-government-kerala-cm/article32956485.ece

KSUM said that while women’s participation in the Kerala’s start-up ecosystem was below par, it was even worse in the technology sector.

The programme began with a hackathon orientation named ‘InnovatHer’ on Monday. This was followed by She Loves Tech India 2020, a pitch workshop for start-ups. The winners of She Loves Tech India 2020, Best Inclusive Incubator, Best Inclusive Startup and Best inclusive IEDC will be announced before the end of the event.

131,2020/10/27,State told to enforce MV Act strictly,"SC appointed panel seeks comprehensive compliance report

The Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety has asked Kerala to strictly enforce the provisions of the Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Act 2019 and to review the decision to impose compounding fee, fine and punishment for violations other than those prescribed in the Act.

The State has been asked to use the provisions of the Act to disqualify and revoke driving licences of two wheelers and Light Motor Vehicles for over-speeding and non-wearing of helmets.

The three-member committee headed by Abhay Manohar Sapre has directed to invoke the provisions of the Act on community service by offenders.

Bowing to pressure from motorists, the State had reduced the penalties while implementing the amended Act last year against the wishes of the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH).

While over-speeding will attract ₹1,000 to ₹4,000 under the Act, in Kerala one has to pay only ₹1,500 to ₹3,000. Driving without seat belt and helmet (rider and pillion rider) will earn a penalty of ₹500 in the State, while it is ₹1,000 as per the Act. In the case of not giving way to emergency vehicles, the penalty as per the Act is ₹10,000, but it is ₹5,000 in the State.

Sanjay Mitra and Nishi Mittal are the other members of the committee.

The observations should be complied with by the authorities concerned by January 31, 2021. A comprehensive compliance report along with the copy of orders issued should be submitted by February 15, 2021, the Secretary of the committee said in a letter to the Chief Secretary.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-told-to-enforce-mv-act-strictly/article32956008.ece

Following complaints raised against the appointment by Janardhanan Nair, the executive council of the Central University had referred the matter to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

The CBI had recommended the dismissal of the lab assistant to the university. Based on the CBI report, the executive council has decided to suspend Ms. Sudha and proceed with departmental action to terminate her service.

The university has also decided to issue a notice seeking her reply with regard to the decision.

The executive council also decided to take disciplinary action in consultation with the Central Vigilance Commission against Central Vigilance Officer M.C.

134,2020/10/27,Concern over conversion of passenger trains to express,"Express trains will not have stoppages at Edamon, Thenmala

While rail services have resumed in the Kollam-Sengottai route, the conversion of passenger trains into express trains is causing great inconvenience to commuters from the eastern parts of the district.

“The decision to convert Kollam-Tambaram, Punalur-Guruvayoor and Punalur-Madurai services into express trains should be reconsidered. The express trains will not have stoppages at Edamon and Thenmala, making it difficult for passengers,” said N.K. Premachandran, MP.

The Punalur-Sengottai section was completed as part of the 325-km Kollam-Sengottai-Tenkasi- Tirunelveli- Thiruchendur gauge conversion project. Train services in this section was stopped for broadening in 2010 and the rail route was commissioned in March 2018.

“Operating only express trains in the route will prevent the benefits of multi-crore gauge conversion from reaching the public. The stoppages at Thenmala and Edamon should be restored,” he said.

The Railways had suspended all services in Kollam-Sengottai route post lockdown and Egmore Express was the first train to resume operations as a special service on October 26. The Egmore Express, which started off as a tri-weekly service on an experiential basis, was made a daily train from March 2019.

The service was started after gauge conversion and in early days it ended at Tambaram. Before the conversion, there was a daily Chennai-Egmore-Kollam train operating in the route which got cancelled when the works for conversion began. It was a long-standing demand of the travellers from Kollam to restore the service.

At present, the Egmore Express will operate as special Train No.06101 with two AC 3-Tier coaches, eight sleeper class coaches and two general second class coaches reaching Kollam from Chennai on 8.45 a.m.

Train number 06102 in return direction will leave Kollam station at 12 noon and arrive at Egmore at 3.05 a.m. the next day. The train earlier had stoppages at Sengottai, Bhagavathipuram, Aryankavu, Tenmala, Edamon, Punalur, Auvaneeswaram, Kottarakara and Kundara.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/concern-over-conversion-of-passenger-trains-to-express/article32955823.ece
135,2020/10/27,New lease of life for Pampa aquatic ecosystem,"CM inaugurates project to restore rich riparian vegetation of the river

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday inaugurated a programme to restore the rich riparian vegetation of the Pampa, which faced severe damage during the 2018 floods.

The project, implemented by the Kerala State Biodiversity Board (KSBB), covers the riverbanks across 10 panchayats in three blocks. The primary phase of the project, initiated at a cost of ₹2 crore under the Rebuild Kerala initiative, envisages restoring as many as 94 riverine species, including threatened ones, along the riverbanks.

Inaugurating the project through videoconferencing, Mr. Vijayan sought the cooperation from people across all walks of life to ensure the sustainability of the programme. As part of it, he also spoke of the plans to impart training to the people residing along the riverbanks through the Kudumbashree for enabling them to earn a living from the wetland ecosystem.

UN study

“A study conducted by the United Nations in the wake of the 2018 floods highlighted the need to adopt nature restoration and conservation programmes to suit the topography and ecology of the location concerned. The project to restore the vegetation along the Pampa banks takes a cue from this recommendation,” he said.

136,2020/10/27,"Elephant skeleton, Chinese pots: Kerala temple cellar throws up a surprise","Skeleton of elephant, Chinese pots, wooden articles among find at Thiruvayamkudy temple

A recent attempt to restore the Thiruvayamkudy Mahadeva temple, near Kaduthuruthy, Kottayam, appears to have brought to light an interesting facet of history associated with the centuries-old structure.

The temple authorities have unearthed several objects, including the skeleton of an elephant, its chain and other wooden articles from a basement in the temple complex here. The articles were found hidden underneath the vegetative growth inside the cellar, which is about 5-ft deep from the ground and can hold only one person at a time.

Several wooden articles, Chinese pots of different sizes and lamps made of bell metal too have been recovered from the vault.

A team of forest officials visited the location and commenced efforts to conduct radiocarbon dating of the animal’s remnants. As part of subjecting the bone samples to carbon-dating, a team from the College of Veterinary Science and Animal Sciences, Mannuthy, Thrissur, will soon inspect the skeleton parts.

G. Prasad, Assistant Conservator of Forests, said the recovered materials included jaw bones, knee bones and a few other bones of the elephant. “Preliminary reports suggested that these belonged to a makhna elephant that lived nearly two centuries ago,” the officer said.

According to him, the temple authorities may now seek permission from the Chief Wildlife Warden to keep these wildlife articles in their possession after making an inventory declaration under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

Meanwhile, the temple trust commenced efforts to open a museum in association with the Department of Archaeology to showcase the articles.

“The elders have passed on information about a mozha (Makhna) elephant that died here over a century ago. The animal is believed to have been cremated in a property just outside the temple complex and some of its bones and chain might have made their way into the vault,” said Vasudevan Namboothiri, president of the Thiruvayamkudy temple trust.

Long history

The history of the temple could be traced back to 1,000 years. “The recovery of elephant bones is indeed a unique incident to have reported from any of the temples. It highlights the need to preserve this heritage temple complex, a one of its kind in the entire region,” observed Pallikonam Rajeev, who has carried out extensive research on the history of the temple.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4t5pe3/article32960901.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/elephent-5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/temple-authorities-stumble-upon-several-objects-during-restoration/article32955751.ece

138,2020/10/27,COVID-19 | Last rites of victims now a bone of contention,"A section of religious bodies have sought permission to clean the bodies as well

Last rites of COVID-19 victims appear to be snowballing into a fresh row having political overtones after the Indian Union Muslim League recently threw its weight behind religious groups that have sought tweaking of the Health Department directives. Meanwhile, the latest guidelines brought out by the World Health Organization (WHO) say that people who die of COVID-19 can be “buried or cremated” according to “local standards and family preferences”.

T. Jayakrishnan, Professor, Department of Community Medicine, Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, points out that it is the duty of the kin to ensure the last rites to the departed. He says, quoting the WHO guidelines, that national and local regulations might determine how the remains should be handled and disposed. Family and friends may view the body after it has been prepared for burials, in accordance with local customs. They, however, “should not touch or kiss the body” and should perform hand hygiene after the viewing.

The guidelines of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare are somewhat similar. Religious rituals such as reading from religious scripts, sprinkling holy water and any other last rites that do not require touching of the body can be allowed, they say.

Though the State government recently allowed kin of the deceased to have a final glimpse of their dear ones before cremation or burial, a section of religious bodies have sought permission to clean the bodies as well. A recent meeting of Muslim organisations decided to petition the Chief Minister and the Health Minister to drive home their point.

WHO norms

The WHO says a body in a body bag or coffin needs to be treated in accordance with local customs and standards. If a body will be buried or cremated without a casket or body bag, surgical or waterproof rubber gloves can be used to place the body in the grave or the funeral pyre. If traditional funeral rituals are required, families and traditional burial attendants can be equipped and instructed in the preparation of bodies for burial or cremation. Although burials or cremations should take place in a timely manner and in accordance with local practices, funeral ceremonies that do not involve the disposal of the body should be postponed, if possible, until the end of the epidemic. If a ceremony is held, the number of participants should be kept to a minimum, says the WHO.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/f605f/article32956186.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28TVMP-COVID-DEATH3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/last-rites-now-a-bone-of-contention/article32955441.ece
139,2020/10/27,Probe on into KTU question paper leak,"28 mobile phones that were allegedly sneaked into the exam halls seized

The probe into the question paper leak of an examination conducted by the A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technological University (KTU) gathered momentum with the seizure of 28 mobile phones that were allegedly sneaked into the examination halls.

The mobile phones were confiscated by the managements of four of the five colleges that had reported malpractice during the conduct of a third semester BTech supplementary examination on ‘Linear Algebra and Complex Analysis’ on October 23.

The mobile phones were apparently used to circulate photos of the question paper on WhatsApp groups that would soon generate the answers to the questions. Despite a similar modus operandi, the authorities were yet to conclude if the malpractice was operated by the same racket.

The incidents were reported from a government-controlled self-financing college, an aided college and three private institutions, where students from other colleges had also appeared for the paper. With the authorities being unable to ascertain whether the fraudulent acts were confined to the five colleges, the examination had been cancelled with a fresh one being scheduled for November 5.

As part of enforcing measures to prevent such malpractice during examinations, Vice Chancellor M.S. Rajasree convened a meeting of college principals and examination superintendents on Tuesday.

Indicating the possibility of a planned strategy, the erring students pursued various ploys to mislead invigilators. College officials, who participated in a hearing conducted by the Syndicate examination subcommittee chaired by Pro Vice Chancellor S. Ayoob, said some students kept a mobile phone outside the examination hall while entering with another.

Preliminary inquiry found that multiple WhatsApp groups were formed for the same subject with some even sharing the answers for 75 marks. Posing technical hurdles to the investigation, college officials claimed that many of the seized mobile phones were currently ‘locked’, suggesting that they could have been blocked using duplicate SIM cards. WhatsApp accounts have also been seemingly migrated to other mobile phones.

The principals have been tasked with convening disciplinary committee meetings and submitting reports of the action adopted within five days. The university’s examination rules provided for debarring those who enter examination halls with mobile phones for the particular paper for the next three consecutive terms.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/probe-on-into-ktu-question-paper-leak/article32955154.ece
140,2020/10/27,"Dip in road accidents, fatalities in Kerala","Increase in fines, lockdown lead to safer roads in the past one year

Increase in penalties following amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act and the COVID-19-induced lockdown have resulted in accidents coming down by 9,700, injuries by 11,325 and in saving 1,233 lives on roads in the State during the 12-month period ending September 2020.

The accidents, injuries and fatalities that were 41,206, 46,140 and 4,468 respectively in the 12 months from September 2018 have come down to 31,508, 34,815 and 3,235 respectively from September 2019 to September 2020.

The reduction is 30%, 31% and 33% respectively for road accidents, injuries and fatalities.

Analysis of the road accident statistics by the Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA) has revealed that there were no significant changes in the accidents from September 2019 to December 2019, the period after the Motor Vehicles Act amendment. However, there was a slight decline in their severity. After the penalties for various offences on the road went up, there was a 4% reduction in crashes and injuries and 17% reduction in road fatalities in January-March 2020.

In the April-May 2020 period when the lockdown was enforced due to the pandemic, the road accidents declined by 75% and fatalities by 78% in the State.

In the ‘Unlock’ period from June to August 2020, the road accidents and injuries across the State were lesser by 40% and fatalities by 34%.

Enforcement measures

A 25% decline in road fatalities during the period, excluding the lockdown period, can be attributed to the stern enforcement measures by the MVD and the police following the MV Act amendment and the roll out of the Safe Kerala Project, says KRSA Executive Director, Road Safety, T. Elangovan.

The accident data for the period from January 2020 to September 2020 period has also shown a decline of 34.7% in accidents and 40.1% in fatalities.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/6w78a5/article32949668.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27tv-accidentsKERcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dip-in-road-accidents-fatalities-in-kerala/article32949669.ece

He regretted the fact that the State had to wait 32 years after the actor's death for a memorial to him. It should have come up in the very next years after his death. The first superstar of Malayalam cinema, Prem Nazir acted in around 600 Malayalam films and more than 30 Tamil films in a career that spanned four decades, Mr. Vijayan noted.

Planned in three storeys, the 15,000 sq ft memorial includes a mini theatre, museum, open-air theatre, stage, library, cafetaria and board rooms.

The facility is being constructed by the Cultural Affairs Department at a cost of ₹4 crore.

Besides, only 3,331 people were tested during the last 24 hours, whereas the number of tests stood at 4,182 the previous day.

Testing has remained over 5,000 for several weeks in the district. Nonetheless, the test positivity rate was yet to drop below 15.

Probably for the first time in several months, no cases of confirmed COVID-19-related death were reported in the district on the day.

14 health workers

Among those who tested positive, 359 people are known to have contracted the infection through local transmission, while the source of infection in 137 others are unknown. Fourteen health workers also tested positive for the disease.

145,2020/10/27,Children initiated into world of letters in Kerala,"Shorter queues seen at many temples in capital due to COVID-19 protocols

Given the COVID-19 scenario, many parents in the district appeared to have opted for an ‘at-home’ Vidyarambham for their children this year, but popular venues such as temples and cultural centres still found takers on the occasion of Vijayadashami on Monday.

COVID-19 containment protocols governed the conduct of the ceremony at the public venues in the capital city.

Writing on rice

Hundreds of tiny tots took their first step into the world of letters by writing on rice at venues including the Saraswathi Mandapam, Poojappura; Thunchan Smarakam, Iranimuttom; Attukal Bhagavathy Temple, and Karikkakom Sri Chamundi Temple.

Unlike in past years, this time the children sat on the laps of their parents who helped them write. At some venues, 'acharyas' were present to offer verbal guidance.

This year, the organisers had also directed parents to bring the rice and trays to further reduce any chance of infection.

“The queues were way shorter this year,” said Poojappura Krishnan Nair, patron, Saraswathi Devi Temple and Mandapam, Poojappura.

Approximately 600 children sat for Vidyarambham at the popular venue on Monday, where the ritual began at 5.30 a.m.

“'Last year, there were around 1,700 children and 55 acharyas. This year, the COVID-19 guidelines were strictly observed. The children were assisted by their parents,” Mr. Krishnan Nair said.

The Poojappura Mandapam drew families from places outside the city limits including Nedumangad and Karakkamandapam.

Less than 50 children sat for Vidyarambham at the Thunchan Smarakam at Iranimuttom.

“'Usually, the number is above 1,000. The families were allowed inside in batches of five every half hour,” said Sudha Harikumar, secretary.

The temples in Thiruvananthapuram also witnessed shorter queues this year, according to the temple trusts. Approximately 300 children each were ushered into the world of letters at the Attukal Bhagavathy Temple and the Karikkakom Sri Chamundi Temple.

Less crowds

Both temples usually see crowds exceeding 1,000.

Taking into account the COVID-19 situation, the State government had requested parents to perform the ceremony at home to reduce the chances of the virus from spreading. The Health Department and the Thiruvananthapuram district administration had issued guidelines for safely conducting the ceremony at public venues.

At Cliff House

The Cliff House, the official residence of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, also witnessed a Vidyarambham ceremony this year. Mr. Vijayan initiated Devana, granddaughter of his driver Vasanthakumar into the world of letters. Mr. Vijayan's wife Kamala and Vasanthakumar's family members were present. Five children at the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare also were initiated into the world of letters on Monday by V. P.

146,2020/10/27,Desecration of cemeteries: 6 detained under NSA,"Eight persons have been accused in the case

Six of the eight accused who have been arrested in connection with vandalism at 86 cemeteries under the control of Sacred Heart Church at Udaiyarpatti here on October 16 have been detained under the National Security Act.

Sabarirajan alias Ayyappan (50) of Murappanadu in Thoothukudi district, A. Sermadurai (43) of Tirunelveli Town, and A. Kanthan (38) of Tirunelveli.

A group of men, armed with crowbars, hammers and other weapons trespassed into the cemetery at Manimurtheeswaram on October 16 night and smashed the granite cross on 86 tombs and crushed polished granite slabs on the tombs in the cemetery.

As the matter came to light the following morning, it triggered tension in Udaiyaarpatti area and the hostility intensified further when the parishioners of Sacred Heart Church blocked North Bypass Road near the church.

Based on the complaint from Rev. Fr. Joseph Michael Selvaraj, parish priest of the church, Thatchanallur police started their investigation that reportedly revealed that it was the handiwork of S. Udaiyar and seven others.

Subsequently, the police registered case under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 297 (trespassing on burial places), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 294 B (sings, recites or utters any obscene songs or words in public places), 353 A (assaults or uses criminal force to deter public servant) and 506 (2) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code against Udaiyar, Muruganantham, Sankar, Sabari Rajan alias Ayyappan, Sermadurai, Kandan, Radhakrishnan (58) of Vannarpet, S. Subramani alias Soda Mani (49) of Veeravanallur.

Moreover, Bishop of Palayamkottai RC Diocese Most Rev. S. Antonysamy, accompanied by the office-bearers of all political parties, including the ruling AIADMK, submitted a petition to Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish on October 18 seeking stringent action against those involved in the desecration of cemeteries with the objective of triggering clash between different religious groups.

147,2020/10/27,BJP condemns police for detaining its leaders,"‘Party becomes suspicious of the intentions of police’

Bharatiya Janata Party State president L. Murugan condemned Tamil Nadu police for detaining party functionaries, who wanted to protest against those who made “derogatory” comments against women, and allowing opposition parties to stage protests.

Without naming Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan, Mr. Murugan told reporters here on Tuesday that his party had planned a State-wide protest against those who defamed women and the parties that supported them.

But the police stopped the BJP leaders and functionaries and detained them. However, the same police had given permission for the VCK to conduct protest demonstration in Chennai and allowed Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam president M.K. Stalin to protest near Raj Bhavan, he charged.

Alleging that the BJP cadre were attacked and the women party members were detained in Madurai, he said that this made the party suspicious of the intentions of the Tamil Nadu police. “Some people are hatching conspiracy to incite communal clashes in the State to further their political interests,” Mr. Murugan claimed.

When asked why the BJP was using the images of MGR on its promotional video, Mr. Murugan said that it was only to reflect that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was following in the footsteps of MGR in helping women.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bjp-condemns-police-for-detaining-its-leaders-madurai/article32957508.ece

Dismissing the bail petition, Justice G.K. Ilanthiraiyan observed that it was a case of honour killing. The petitioner, with an intention to kill both his daughter and son-in-law, attacked them with a billhook in the wee hours when they were asleep. They succumbed to the injuries.

The case of the prosecution was that Alagar’s daughter A. Petchiammal fell in love with T. Solairaja and they got married in April last year against the wish of the woman’s family. Irked by this, Alagar killed the couple, it was submitted.

After their marriage, Solairaja and Petchiammal, both salt pan workers, moved to a small single-room house in Thanthai Periyar Nagar near Kulathur in Thoothukudi district. The man’s mother was staying in a relative’s house situated close by.

151,2020/10/27,"Doctor ends life, blames DSP in suicide note","Relatives refuse to sign post-mortem documents, accept body

Accusing a Deputy Superintendent of Police of harassing and threatening him, a doctor from Parakkai, who was running a clinic here, committed suicide by consuming poison on Monday night.

In a suicide note purportedly left behind by him, the doctor, Sivarama Perumal (45), accused Kanniyakumari DSP Bhaskaran of harassing and threatening him for a while.

The relatives of the deceased said Sivarama Perumal was returning home in his car with his wife Seetha (40), also a doctor working at Agastheeswaram Primary Health Centre, and two children around 8.30 p.m. on July 12. As they reached Mela Krishnanpudhur, their car was stopped by a police team, led by the DSP.

“When Sivarama Perumal tried to tell the police officer who they were in English, the DSP verbally abused him for speaking in English. The DSP also verbally abused Dr. Seetha in the presence of their children when she intervened,” a relative said.

The doctor’s suicide note also recalls this unpleasant incident, in which he had accused Bhaskaran of having used unparliamentary words against him and his wife.

Though Sivarama Perumal was a qualified physician and had a clinic at Parakkai, he did not practise medicine while his wife continued the practice. However, one of the deceased doctor’s relatives, S. Vijay Anand of Elanthaivilai, allegedly informed government officials that Sivarama Perumal was not qualified for practising medicine.

“Following this, the torture by the DSP increased so much that it has driven Sivarama Perumal to take the extreme step,” the relative added. However, none could explain the reasons for the repeated torture or threats as claimed by the doctor in his suicide note.

After Sivarama Perumal consumed poison, he was rushed to the Government Medical College Hospital at Asaripallam here on Monday night. However, the doctors declared him “brought dead”. Agitated over this, his relatives refused to sign the documents relating to post-mortem and accept the body on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Superintendent of Police V. Badri Narayanan deputed Colachel ASP Vishwesh B. Shastri and Nagercoil DSP R. Venugopal to conduct inquiries and check the veracity of the allegations being levelled against Bhaskaran. “If the allegations are found to be true, appropriate action will be taken,” Mr. Badri Narayanan said.

In his speech, he attacked Mr. Velumani, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and the Coimbatore city police. He alleged corruption in multiple projects undertaken by Coimbatore Corporation such as the Smart Cities Project and entering into a contract with Suez India for water distribution.

“Tamil Nadu has been letting go of its rights one after the other,” Mr. Udhayanidhi alleged, highlighting issues such as the delay in the implementation of the 7.5% horizontal reservation for NEET-qualified students from government schools in the undergraduate medical admissions and Anna University seeking Institute of Eminence status from the Central government.

DMK MPs on Tuesday sought a direction from Union Home Minister Amit Shah to Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit to grant assent without delay to the bill providing 7.5% horizontal reservation for the NEET-qualified State government school students in the undergraduate medical courses.

In separate letters to Mr. Shah, the MPs pointed out that the Governor had been holding the bill, which was passed in the Tamil Nadu Assembly 43 days ago. “The DMK has been demanding the scrapping of NEET, which acts as a hindrance to the rural and urban poor students to pursue medical studies and to realise their dream of becoming future doctors,” the MPs said.

They said party president M.K.Stalin had already written a letter to the Governor, urging him to give assent to the bill immediately so that the government school students could avail of the benefit of reservation in this academic year itself.

“But, surprisingly the Governor had replied that he would need another three to four weeks to decide on the bill – after holding back this very important Bill for about 40 days,” they pointed out.

These stretches have been marked as accident prone zones and recommended for corrective measures. The measures involved short, mid and long-term steps comprising fixing of barricades, speed breakers, automated signals, installation of high mast lights, solar blinkers and caution boards”, Superintendent of Police Ziaul Haque told The Hindu.

Since Kallakurichi is a new district, the Police department has proposed safety measures to the tune of ₹1 crore under the Road Safety Fund. The proposal has been sent to the District Collector to be forwarded to the Transport Commissioner, Mr. Haque added.

An analysis of the accident spots revealed that four-lane narrowed down to two-lane at five stretches, which the road users fail to notice while driving at high speed. “We have now placed barricades at these five stretches to slow down. The barricades would ensure that ensure that vehicles never crossed the stretch at high speeds.

The Department has also written to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for installation of high-mast lamps to ensure visibility at night”, he said.

The District police have also chalked out an action plan to reduce road accidents and to ensure compliance of rules. More than 50 police personnel have been pressed into service to conduct mass vehicle check daily within the jurisdictional limits of the three police sub-divisions in the district on a rotational basis.

A zero-tolerance policy is being followed against traffic violations including those driving without helmets, drunk driving and triple riding. Cases are booked against violators. Motorists found violating the rules are also asked to read awareness messages on banners put up at the locations where vehicle checks are being conducted.

While imposition of fine is not the primary objective, the motorists are involved in the awareness campaign in the hope that it would convince them of their mistakes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/um49au/article32950574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/kallakurichi-police-analyse-accident-data-to-promote-road-safety/article32950575.ece
162,2020/10/27,Kushboo held ahead of protest against Thirumavalavan,"Visit and protest may create tension in Chidambaram town, according to police officer

Actor-turned politician Kushboo and her supporters were on Tuesday arrested by the police when they were proceeding towards Chidambaram to lead a protest against Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader and Chidambaram Lok Sabha member Thol. Thirumavalavan for his recent remarks against what he claimed Manusmriti said on women.

A senior police officer said she and 20 others of the BJP were taken into preventive custody as their visit and protest may create tension in Chidambaram town. They will be booked under Section 151(knowingly joining or continuing in assembly of five or more persons after it has been commanded to disperse) of IPC or Section 7(1)(a) (with intent to cause any person to abstain from doing or to do any act which such person has a right to do or to abstain from doing, obstructs or uses violence to or intimidates such person) of Criminal Law Amendment Act. The provisions will be decided later, said police sources.

A statement made by Mr. Thirumavalavan during a webinar in September became controversial last week, after a clipping went viral. He claimed that Manusmriti must be banned as it treated women badly.

Ms. Kushboo, who recently jumped ship from the Congress to the BJP, accused him of denigrating women, challenging him to find passages in the Manusmriti to support his charge.

BJP members showed their opposition to Mr. Thirumavalavan when he visited Kavunthapadi, Erode district, on Monday.

In the meantime, the BJP planned to stage a protest on Tuesday against Mr. Thirumavalavan in Chidambaram and other places across the State. On Monday night, a group of VCK workers demanded permission from the Collector to conduct a counter protest.

Sensing trouble, the district officials and top police officers met and decided to deny permission to both.

In the morning hours, Ms. Kushboo was stopped by the Chengalpattu police on East Coast Road near Muttukadu and picked up. Along with her, BJP supporters were also taken into preventive custody, said police.

BJP vice-president K.T.Ragavan was also picked up near Tindivanam, police added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/acqzl8/article32950457.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kushboo-held,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/kushboo-held-ahead-of-protest-against-thirumavalavan/article32950445.ece
163,2020/10/27,Udhayanidhi to lead protest condemning police action,"12 DMK cadre were arrested for tearing posters that allegedly insulted party president Stalin

DMK youth wing leader Udhayanidhi Stalin will lead a protest in Coimbatore on Tuesday to condemn police action against DMK workers who tore posters that appeared in different parts of the city, which, according to them, mocked and belittled party president M.K. Stalin.

After 12 DMK workers were arrested for tearing the posters on Sunday, Mr. Udhayanidhi condemned the action on Twitter, stating that the Coimbatore city police were functioning as an extension of the AIADMK.

DMK general secretary S. Duraimurugan also condemned the police action, in a statement, in which he asked the AIADMK to quit the politics of using “uncivilised posters” and seek votes by listing authentic facts. He also criticised the police for not taking action against those who put up the posters, which did not have the name of the printing press where they were printed.

As per details provided by the Coimbatore city police, 12 DMK workers were arrested by R.S. Puram, Selvapuram and Kuniyamuthur police for charges including unlawful assembly, creating public nuisance and issuing threats to complainants who questioned them while tearing posters. The cadre were released on bail on Sunday.

It is learnt that the DMK sought permission from the city police to picket Kuniyamuthur police station, where a maximum of seven DMK workers were arrested. Permission was denied, following which the DMK leadership planned for a protest in front of the south taluk office on Tuesday.

Posters in Tiruchi

In Tiruchi, the Fort police have launched an investigation into posters put up at a few spots, featuring caricatures of DMK president M.K. Stalin, coupled with insulting inscriptions. The police could not immediately determine where the posters, found at three spots near the Chathram bus stand, were printed.

The posters have photos of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on one side and caricatures of Mr. Stalin on the other, apparently showing the latter in poor light.

164,2020/10/27,A Thoothukudi salon catches the PM’s eye,"Maintaining a library in his salon has ensured national fame for Pon Mariappan

For his customers of Millerpuram in Thoothukudi, hairdresser Pon Mariappan’s passion for books is well known. His salon is equipped not just with hair-dressing equipment but also a mini-library to encourage clients to read a book until their turn comes.

For his customers, his small but neatly maintained salon even during the pandemic is a ‘temple of knowledge’, where the portraits of gods and goddesses share space with photographs of icons like Thiruvalluvar, Mahatma Gandhi, Vivekananda, Bharati and Abdul Kalam.

And his message on the importance of books and reading attracted national attention last Sunday, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to an elated Mr. Mariappan during his latest national radio ‘Man ki baat’ after hearing about his hairdresser’s library.

Though Pon Mariappan could not continue his studies after Class 8, his tenure as the clerk of an advocate brought home to him the importance of reading. After he started his hairdressing unit at Millerpuram a few years ago, Mr. Mariappan was pained to see his customers indulging in pointless small talk while waiting their turn. The situation, he says worsened with the advent of smartphones and social media.

“So, I set up the library in my salon having experienced the benefits of reading. After the library became a part of my workplace, absolute silence prevails here as the visitors get involved in a book while waiting. When the waiting customers sit idle without reading anything, lectures of Sukhi Sivam, Nellai Kannan, Thamizharvui Manian, Parveen Sultana, mostly on positive thinking, literature, Thirukkural etc. is played to get them engrossed instead of allowing them to discuss ‘rubbish’,” Mr. Mariappan says.

Once the hairdressing is done, customers are requested to record thier opinions on the books they read. “The valuable opinions of my customers encourage me to add more books on diverse topics,” he says.

When Mr. Modi greeted him in Tamil saying “Vanakkam… Nallaa Irukkengala?” and asked him about the reason behind his creating a library in the salon, Mr. Mariappan was on cloud nine as he could voice his views on the importance of reading to an national audience. He also told the Prime Minister during the brief conversation that Thirukkural was close to his heart always.

“The wishes I could get from the Prime Minister is something special,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/56vc1p/article32948497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THHAIRDRESSER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/a-thoothukudi-salon-catches-the-pms-eye/article32948498.ece

166,2020/10/27,"AIADMK govt. reduced quota to 7.5%, says Stalin","‘Justice Kalaiyarasan recommended 10% reservation’

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Monday said the AIADMK government reduced the horizontal reservation for NEET-qualified State government school students in undergraduate medical admissions to 7.5%, even though Justice Kalaiyarasan had recommended 10% reservation.

Speaking at the wedding of a family member of a party functionary, he said the government was not able to get the Governor’s assent even for a Bill that sought to give just 7.5% reservation. “Forty days have passed since the Bill was adopted in the Assembly. The Governor is yet to give his nod to the legislation,” he said.

Mr. Stalin said the Governor had sought four weeks to take a decision on the Bill and by delaying his consent, he only intented to dilute the issue. “That was why we organised a demonstration and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami accused us of politicising the issue. But the AIADMK is only interested in getting commission,” he said.

He said the AIADMK government should be removed to protect the interests of the State.

“The 2021 Assembly election have provided us an opportunity to complete the task, and let us make use of it,” he said.

In a separate statement, he urged Mr. Palaniswami to exert pressure on the Centre to implement reservations in medical seats surrendered to the Central pool by the State government.

“If the BJP government refuses to implement it, the Chief Minister should announce that he will not form an alliance with the BJP in the Assembly elections,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-govt-reduced-quota-to-75-says-stalin/article32948479.ece
167,2020/10/27,"From just 1,945 in 2010-11, we now have 3,400 MBBS seats: CM","‘Centre has approved medical colleges in 11 districts’

From 1,945 MBBS seats in 2010-2011, the number of medical seats in the State has risen to 3,400 now. In the coming years, 11 new government medical colleges will offer 1,650 more seats, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said.

“To enable more students from rural areas and economically backward sections to realise their dream of becoming doctors, the State government, in a short period, has got the Centre’s approval to establish new medical colleges in 11 districts — Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Dindigul, the Nilgiris, Ariyalur, Nagapattinam, Kallakurichi, Tiruvallur, Tiruppur, Namakkal and Krishnagiri. Foundation stones have been laid and construction is under way. The State government has taken measures to create an additional 1,650 MBBS seats in the coming years,” he said after inaugurating the Fortis Hospital in Vadapalani here on Monday.

The State government had passed a Bill to provide 7.5% horizontal reservation in medical admissions to enable students of government schools to become doctors, he said.

The Chief Minister emphasised that medicine was a “fine art” and not a “business”. Listing out the State’s achievements in healthcare, the Chief Minister said: “Last year, the infant mortality rate came down from 16 to 15 (deaths per 1,000 live births), while the State has already achieved the 2030 target of Sustainable Development Goals in reducing the maternal mortality rate.”

A total of 254 new primary health centres (PHC) have been established, and 166 PHCs upgraded. In the last three years, 56 CT scan machines, 22 MRI scan machines, 18 cath labs and 530 dialysis machines have been provided to government hospitals, he said.

He added that to enhance cancer care in the government sector, Linear Accelerators were being installed at 10 government hospitals, at a cost of ₹190 crore. Work to upgrade the Adyar Cancer Institute, at ₹120 crore, too was nearing completion, while the Government Arignar Anna Memorial Cancer Hospital in Kancheepuram was being upgraded at a cost of ₹120 crore, he said.

“Along with government hospitals, private facilities too are functioning well in the State, providing quality healthcare to the people,” he said.

168,2020/10/27,Stalin writes to Prime Minister on SC verdict on OBC quota,"Leaders express disappointment over court order

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Monday sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention to ensure that the terms of implementation of the State-specific quota for OBC students in the all-India quota (AIQ) seats for medical admissions were finalised by the committee constituted for the purpose.

In his letter to the Prime Minister, a copy of which was released to the media, he said there was a real concern that students belonging to the Other Backward Classes (OBC) would not benefit from the State-specific reservation in the current academic year.

The Supreme Court on Monday declined to order interim relief of implementing 50% reservation this year itself for NEET-UG students belonging to OBCs in medical and dental seats contributed to the AIQ by State government-run colleges in Tamil Nadu.

“Without the implementation of reservation, thousands of students will not have a chance to pursue higher education in the field of medicine. Therefore, I urge you to intervene immediately and ensure that thousands of students and medical aspirants from disadvantaged and underprivileged communities are given an opportunity to study medicine,” he said.

Mr. Stalin also pointed out the order of the Madras High Court, in a case filed by the DMK, reiterating that OBC students had a right to reservation in AIQ Seats.

“It would be an unimaginable loss to our country, especially during the time of an unprecedented [COVID-19] pandemic, if students from underprivileged communities are not provided opportunities to study medicine and serve our country,” he added.

‘Disappointing verdict’

The PMK, MDMK, VCK, CPI(M) and MMK blamed the stance taken by the Centre for the Supreme Court’s refusal to provide the interim relief.

PMK Founder S. Ramadoss said in a statement: “The verdict is disappointing. The stance taken by the Centre that it cannot be implemented this year due to the various cases pending on the issue is the reason for the outcome.” He urged Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to send a delegation comprising political leaders from the State to New Delhi to meet the Prime Minister.

The team should urge the Prime Minister to stop online medical counselling for AIQ seats, which is going to commence in the next few days, and the Centre can decide on the OBC quota and implement it immediately, Mr. Ramadoss noted.

MDMK chief Vaiko said the Centre had shown deceit on the issue, from the beginning, and strongly condemned it. He expressed disappointment over the verdict.

VCK founder Thol. Thirumavalavan urged the Chief Minister to immediately call for an all-party meeting to express consensus on the issue and pursue legal options.

MMK president M.H. Jawahirullah also urged the Chief Minister to call an all-party meeting and take action to uphold the principles of social justice.

CPI (M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan pointed out that the verdict would affect OBC students and said the BJP government at the Centre had betrayed them and acted against social justice.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/i0k58f/article32824088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stalin-writes-to-prime-minister-on-sc-verdict-on-obc-quota/article32948452.ece

170,2020/10/27,Water from Poondi released into Red Hills reservoir,"Surplus inflow from Kosasthalaiyar helps maintain storage

With the Poondi reservoir, one of the city’s drinking water sources, receiving more inflow besides Krishna water, the surplus has been released to the Puzhal lake in Red Hills to step up its storage.

Heavy rain over the past few days in the catchment areas upstream and the surplus water released from Ammapalli reservoir in Andhra Pradesh into the Kosasthalaiyar have been bringing considerable inflows to the Poondi reservoir.

The waterbody has already been receiving Krishna water from Andhra Pradesh for a month now. Of the inflow of 810 cusecs (cubic feet per second), the reservoir got 352 cusecs as flood water runoff from catchment areas and the Kosasthalaiyar.

Officials of the Water Resources Department said water was discharged to the Red Hills reservoir due to a dip in storage. Its storage stood at 2.01 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) against a capacity of 3.3 tmcft, and it received about 160 cusecs of water from the Poondi reservoir on Monday.

“We have also been diverting water to the Chembarambakkam reservoir for a week now to boost its storage. Water is being drawn from both lakes to supply the city’s drinking water,” an official said.

The city has been receiving Krishna water since last month, and it has added nearly 2.1 tmcft of storage in the nearby reservoirs.

The four reservoirs together have storage of 5.4 tmcft, which is nearly 50% of their capacity, as on Monday. This will be sufficient to maintain supply till the summer of next year.

With near normal rainfall predicted during the northeast monsoon, officials noted that Krishna water and rain water would be sufficient to maintain supply.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/l1jv26/article32948355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26OCTTHPUZHAL-RES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/water-from-poondi-released-into-red-hills-reservoir/article32948356.ece
171,2020/10/27,Tension erupts over VCK leader’s visit,"BJP cadre raise slogans; wordy duel ensues between members of both parties

Tension prevailed for some time in Kandasamiyanur village, near Kavindapadi in Erode, on Monday, after Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) cadre allegedly pelted stones at a police vehicle, in which Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) cadre were being taken for raising slogans against the visit of VCK founder and Chidambaram MP Thol. Thirumavalavan, for his interpretation of how the Hindu text, Manusmriti, viewed women.

Mr. Thirumavalavan was scheduled to attend the wedding of a doctor’s son on the hospital premises, in the village, where over 100 VCK cadre had gathered. As the news of his visit spread, BJP cadre also gathered at the spot and raised slogans against Mr. Thirumavalavan for his recent remarks on the Manusmriti and women. At 10.45 a.m., the leader arrived at the marriage hall. BJP cadre raised slogans, and efforts by the police to pacify them failed.

Tension erupted after cadre from both parties got involved in a wordy duel, and the police, realising that the situation was worsening, removed 15 BJP cadre, in a police vehicle. VCK cadre allegedly pelted stones at the vehicle, breaking the vehicle glass. The BJP cadre were taken to the Kavindapadi police station. At 11.30 a.m., Mr. Thirumavalavan left for Salem after attending the wedding.

Later, condemning the arrest of the BJP cadre, party members staged a road roko at the Kavindapadi Four Road junction, and 14 persons were removed in a police vehicle and taken to a marriage hall.

172,2020/10/27,Oxygen capacity augmentation under way,"Works have been taken up on a war footing

Amid the pandemic, augmenting oxygen capacity at government hospitals has turned into a focus area for the health authorities. Keeping in line with the increasing demand for oxygen among patients, the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) has taken up work to install liquid medical oxygen tanks at government hospitals in the State.

Installation of liquid oxygen tanks was taken up across institutions under the Directorate of Medical Education (DME) and the Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services (DMS) from July. Around 40 to 45 COVID-19 hospitals in the two directorates — including government medical college hospitals and affiliated institutions, government hospitals and district headquarters hospitals — are being covered.

TNMSC officials said work to augment oxygen capacity at government hospitals was nearing completion.

According to data with the TNMSC, the total existing liquid oxygen tank capacity of institutions under the DME was 349.039 kilolitre (kl), and it was 6.026 kl in DMS institutions, till the augmentation works began in July.

Between July and August, the proposed augmented capacity was 66 kl for government medical college hospitals (DME institutions) and 8 kl for DMS institutions. For the period from September to October (including ongoing), the proposed augmented capacity was 317.5 kl for DME institutions and 22 kl for DMS institutions. With this, the capacity after augmentation/shifting at government medical college hospitals will rise to 732.539 kl and that of DMS institutions to 36.026 kl — in total, amounting to 768.565 KL.

“The State’s average oxygen requirement, in a day, varies according to the patient load. At peak demand, it was above 120 kl, and it should have come down now. The requirement of oxygen has increased by 3.5 to 4 times since March in the State,” P. Umanath, managing director, TNMSC, said. He added that liquid oxygen tanks were being installed at a cost of around ₹11 crore. “The work is nearing completion,” he said. The largest single tank that is being installed is a 35 kl structure at the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital in Salem, while 24-kl tanks are being installed at the Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, and the Villupuram Government Medical College Hospital.

A senior government doctor in Chennai said oxygen was the primary treatment for many patients, especially those with moderate and severe COVID-19. “Some patients with mild disease do require oxygen. This includes obese persons in the mild category and those with co-morbidities,” he said.

Another hospital authority said the augmentation of oxygen tanks would enable the uninterrupted supply of oxygen for those in need of support.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8n3790/article32948340.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27New-liquid-oxygencol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/oxygen-capacity-augmentation-under-way/article32948341.ece

174,2020/10/27,Harshvardhan Rane: Bollywood fails to notice what you are capable of when you are unfamiliar,"As he recovers from COVID-19, actor Harshvardhan Rane discusses the effort it took to be part of Bejoy Nambiar’s upcoming ensemble drama, ‘Taish’

He calls it “karmic coincidence”, but expecting any other response from Harshvardhan Rane — a self-confessed fan of filmmaker Bejoy Nambiar — is futile. “I’m a blind fan of Bejoy’s. There is a TV clip he used in one of his earlier works, a short film, and I was the actor in that clip. I think we were destined to work together,” he says.

Such is the admiration, that the 36-year-old actor admits to quarantining himself in his room for a week (much before his tryst with COVID-19) to mentally prepare for the role of Pali in Nambiar’s upcoming film Taish.

The primary emotion driving Pali, says Harshvardhan, is rage. “It was important for me to find out where that rage comes from. It is not an everyday emotion. I think it has to do with incidents from one’s childhood. When I got the role, I spent a week without my phone in a room, stayed away from all human contact, and asked the people in my home to just slide the food to me on a plate so that I don’t see anyone. I started recording myself and took notes of things that could have affected Pali’s relationship with his parents and siblings. I wanted to build the rage gradually,” says Harshvardhan, over phone from Mumbai.

Offbeat track

That one of his actors was subjecting himself to this treatment did worry Nambiar, especially after — Harshvardhan remarks with a laugh — the latter told him: “I will see you on the other side.” The output of his efforts, however, convinced the filmmaker that it was the right thing to do. “Before the shoot, he (Bejoy) told me that I should refer to my notes if ever I felt that the character was not developing according to the ‘graph’ that both of us had agreed on. So I think he was satisfied with my work,” he adds.

The actor is still on the recovery trail after contracting COVID-19; his voice is coarse and the stress of uttering words floats through in his tone. “Apart from strong medicines, it is the belief that is bringing me back. When you are down with COVID, it is essential for people to mentally look forward to something. I’m grateful that Bejoy kept sending me teaser, trailer and the poster (for Taish) whilst I was in ICU. I even did a bit of dubbing from there,” Harshvardhan says.

Taish is an action-drama set in the UK and follows the lives of five people, some of whom are baying for revenge. Besides Harshvardhan, the film stars Pulkit Samrat, Kriti Kharbanda, Jim Sarbh, Abhimanyu Singh and Sanjeeda Shaikh among others. Interestingly, Taish is set to release as a film as well as a six-episode web series simultaneously, and while it has kicked up intrigue among movie buffs, Harshvardhan is clear about his preference.

“I ran away from my house when I was 16 to be a part of films. So I’m rooting for Taish as a film because we shot it as one, but I’m blown away by Bejoy’s genius to experiment with the content.” But he is quick to note: “It is not any disrespect [for web series]. It is just due to the unfamiliarity.”

He then tries to draw a parallel with a remark that is more a sharp take on how the film industry perceives outsiders. “It is like how people [in films] don’t know me, so they look through me and don’t notice me. It is not that I do not want to deliver or cannot work on myself. It is just that there is no familiarity,” Harshvardhan says.

The actor was supposed to have started work on his next Bollywood film a couple of weeks ago, if not for the virus. “My COVID situation pushed the start date to November 9. I think there will be an announcement about the film at the end of October,” he says.

175,2020/10/27,Voice of the stars: Singer Madhura picks her favourite female solo tracks,"A powerful solo can hold a song entirely on its own. For this week’s Playlist, singer Madhura Dhara Talluri, the voice behind ‘Unakaaga’ in ‘Bigil’, lists her favourite tracks that ride on the female singer’s musical prowess

Aaja Ri Nindiya (Do Bigha Zamin)

This is not your average lullaby by Lata Mangeshkar. The video has a mother singing to her child, and how the household help misses her own. Across the world, people can relate to it. When I first tried to sing this, it brought out so many emotions. Thinking of the strong visual helped me deliver it. Even now, when I speak about this Salil Chowdhary-composed track, I choke.

Chupke Se (Saathiya)

This is the Hindi version of the popular Tamil track ‘Snehitane’; the lyric and melody go hand in hand here. There are two contrasting melodies inside this, yet they gel well. Lyricist Gulzar’s vivid yet relatable imagery drew me to this song. There’s a mystical setting to this AR Rahman-composed song that has been sung beautifully by Sadhana Sargam.

Manasuna Mallela (Malliswari)

The background music is negligible in this classic Telugu song; it’s just the singer and the shruti playing in the background. This plays out in an intimate sequence, and the song talks about how the leading lady is at peace... singer-actor Bhanumathi whispers the word ‘hai’ which brings out the intimacy in her voice. The gamakas Bhanumathi brings out are unique. I would recommend singers to try reproducing her phrases in this song.

Vaan Varuvaan (Katru Veliyidai)

I was not too fluent in Tamil when this song released, but still I understood what it was trying to convey. The melody did that so beautifully. Later, when I understood the meaning of the words, it just made it more wholesome. There’s a pristine quality to both the audio and video of this track sung by Shashaa Tirupati.

Agar Tum Saath Ho (Tamasha)

This song generates a feeling of helplessness. The word ‘Agar’ (if) is so important in this track, but beyond the pain, there is sense of comfort. What I adore about this track by Alka Yagnik is its nature to protect and comfort you as well as well as throw you into the reality of the situation, which is all about loneliness. The contrasting emotion this song generates really hits you.

We would love to know how you are keeping busy at home.

177,2020/10/27,COVID-19 claims life of veteran Gujarati film star,"His contribution to field of entertainment, social service will always be remembered, says PM

Veteran Gujarati film star-turned-politician Naresh Kanodia died on Tuesday due to COVID-19 at a city-based hospital. He was a BJP MLA and had a massive following base in the State.

The 77-year-old died at the UN Mehta Institute of Cardiology and Research Centre where he was put on ventilator support after he was admitted on October 20. He had also undergone a bypass surgery.

His death came two days after his elder brother and leading Gujarati singer Mahesh Kanodia died at his residence in Gandhinagar after prolonged illness. Known as Naresh-Mahesh duo, they were the main faces in Gujarati movies in 1980s and 90s.

Mahesh Kanodia was also once parliamentarian from the Patan Lok Sabha seat and legislator from the BJP. The entire family has been associated with the ruling party. Mr. Naresh Kanodia’s son Hitesh is also a BJP legislator from north Gujarat.

The Kanodia brothers performed together in a number of stage shows in India and abroad.

Mr. Naresh Kanodia had worked in over 100 films in his career spanning several decades. He later joined politics and was elected a BJP MLA from the Karjan constituency between 2002 and 2007.

After the news of his demise became public, condolences started pouring in from all quarters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter, “Saddened by the death of veteran actor and former MLA Naresh Kanodia. His contribution to the field of entertainment and social service will always be remembered. Condolences to family members and fans.

“In a span of two days, we have lost both Maheshbhai and Nareshbhai Kanodia. Their contributions to the world of culture, especially popularising Gujarati songs, music and theatre will never be forgotten. They also worked hard to serve society and empower the downtrodden.”

Chief Minister Vijay Rupani also posted his message on Twitter. “I am saddened by the sad demise of Gujarati film superstar and BJP leader Nareshbhai Kanodia. Gujarat will always feel the loss of an evergreen actor who won the hearts of Gujaratis by popularising Gujarati films through his leading performances.

“His invaluable contribution in social and art fields will inspire the new generation,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/veteran-gujarati-actor-naresh-kanodia-dies-at-77/article32952975.ece
178,2020/10/27,"Soumitra Chatterjee very critical, stops responding to treatment","The 85-year-old actor, under treatment for the last 22 days, is suffering from secondary pneumonia and his kidneys are not functioning well

The health condition of legendary Bengali actor Soumitra Chatterjee, who is currently on ventilator support, worsened further on Tuesday, and the thespian has almost stopped responding to treatments, a senior doctor at the hospital, where he has been admitted, said.

The 85-year-old actor, under treatment for the last 22 days, is suffering from secondary pneumonia and his kidneys are not functioning well, he said.

“Mr Chatterjee is barely conscious. He has been given oxygen support and is being treated for dehydration. His kidneys are not functioning properly. The octogenarian’s urea and creatinine levels have gone up and he is not responding to treatments. His overall condition has worsened. He is very critical,” the senior doctor said.

The veteran actor’s neurological condition has also deteriorated and that was of primary concern, he said.

Chatterjee was put on ventilator with an endotracheal intubation to protect his airways on Monday evening. His haemoglobin level and platelet count have gone down. Endotracheal intubation is a medical procedure in which a tube is placed into the windpipe through the mouth or nose.

The critically acclaimed actor, the first Indian film personality to be awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres —France’s highest civilian award —was admitted to the hospital here on October 6 after he tested positive for COVID-19.

Last week, he was shifted to a non-COVID Intensive Trauma Unit (ITU), having recovered from the viral disease.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/x2ozmb/article32952594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NATIONALFILMAWARDS2012,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/soumitra-chatterjee-very-critical-stops-responding-to-treatment/article32952595.ece

180,2020/10/27,Emily Ratajkowski and Sebastian Bear-McClard expecting first child,"The model also shot a video at home chronicling her pregnancy, directed by her friend, writer-actor Lena Dunham

Supermodel-actor Emily Ratajkowski is expecting her first child with actor and producer Sebastian Bear-McClard.

The “Gone Girl” star made the announcement in an essay for Vogue magazine on Monday.

Ratajkowski, who didn’t disclose when she was due, said she doesn’t want to reveal her baby’s sex.

“When my husband and I tell friends that I’m pregnant, their first question after ‘Congratulations’ is almost always ‘Do you know what you want?’ We like to respond that we won’t know the gender until our child is 18 and that they’ll let us know then,” she wrote.

This is a “wondrous and terrifying concept”, one that renders the couple both helpless and humbled,” Ratajkowski said.

“Everyone laughs at this. There is a truth to our line, though, one that hints at possibilities that are much more complex than whatever genitalia our child might be born with: the truth that we ultimately have no idea who - rather than what - is growing inside my belly. Who will this person be? What kind of person will we become parents to? How will they change our lives and who we are?” she added.

Ratajkowski said she doesn’t like how society forces “gender-based preconceptions” onto people, let alone babies.

“I want to be a parent who allows my child to show themself to me. And yet I realise that while I may hope my child can determine their own place in the world, they will, no matter what, be faced with the undeniable constraints and constructions of gender before they can speak or, hell, even be born.”

The model also wrote and shot a video at home for the publication chronicling her pregnancy. It was directed by her friend, writer-actor Lena Dunham.

181,2020/10/27,Police keep tight leash on BJP leaders across Telangana,"State party chief Bandi breaks fast

The BJP protest against the police actions in bundling out the party president, Bandi Sanjay Kumar, from outskirts of Siddipet and raids on party leaders houses as a prelude to the Dubbak byelection reverberated for the second day on Tuesday.

While Mr. Sanjay Kumar, also Karimnagar MP, broke his self-imposed protest fast on the request of leaders like Jithender Reddy, Vivek and others once his sugar levels dropped late in the night, at Karimnagar, the police kept leaders across the State under a tight leash preventing them from coming out to take out any protests.

City president and MLC N. Ramchander Rao was put under house arrest, Nizamabad MP D. Aravind was not allowed to come out of his home and another leader G. Manohar Reddy was confined to the Saifabad police station

Senior leaders like national BC morcha president K. Laxman, former MP Vivek Venkataswamy, D.K. Aruna, Babu Mohan, P. Sudhakar Reddy and others strongly criticised the police action against the party leaders. It only reflected the Government’s fear of losing the byelection, they observed.

Vice-president N.V.S.S. Prabhakar demanded the Election Commission take cognisance of the happenings at Siddipet and immediately take steps to ensure finance minister T. Harish Rao is kept out of the area to allow free and fair poll. The top police officials of Siddipet should be transferred out.

Siddipet district collector Venkatrami Reddy has already been shifted following charges of “misuse” of official machinery by the BJP and the Congress Party and Mancherial collector Bharati Hollekeri has been posted in his place.

Chief spokesperson Krishnasagaar Rao has denounced the “highhanded behaviour” of police in arresting Mr. Sanjay Kumar. “If the police had any grounds for his arrest, they could have very well done it without having to use brute force”, he said.

Mr. Rao questioned if the police were acting independently or with the permission of the election commission. The level playing field is missing in the current campaign and hence, the EC should look into the matter, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/jfy34s/article32957814.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY28SGRBJP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/police-keep-tight-leash-on-bjp-leaders-across-telangana/article32957815.ece

183,2020/10/27,Greedy traders exploiting cotton growers: CPI,"The CPI State Assistant Secretary K Sambasiva Rao alleged that greedy traders were exploiting the gullible cotton growers at the Khammam market yard by denying them Minimum Support Price (MSP) citing moisture content.

He was addressing a demonstration organised by the CPI district council in front of the market yard on Tuesday. Earlier, mild tension prevailed when some aggrieved farmers tried to stall the transactions at the yard alleging that the errant traders were fleecing the hapless farmers. The agriculture market committee chairman M Venkataramana intervened and assured to look into the grievances of the agitated farmers.

Mr Samabasiva Rao alleged that cotton farmers suffered severe losses due to the recent rain devastation. “The unabated exploitation by the greedy traders further compounded the woes of the cotton growers,” he charged, alleging that several of them were compelled to sell their produce at a meagre ₹ 2,000 to ₹ 2,500 per quintal as against the MSP of ₹ 5,825 per quintal. He demanded that the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) should commence cotton procurement immediately to ensure remunerative price for the cotton growers.

184,2020/10/27,CEC asked to deploy Central forces for Dubbak bypoll,"State police working under control of TRS, say TPCC leaders

The Congress party has demanded that the Central Election Commission deploy Central forces in Dubbak bye-election to stop use of money power, bribery and corrupt practices by the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to create an atmosphere for free and fair elections.

In the backdrop of incidents related to seizure of cash reportedly from the BJP candidate Raghunanda Rao’s relatives and the accusations over TRS using the police to nail the opponents, the Congress wrote a letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora to direct the officials to book cases against all those involved in the incident.

The letter signed by TPCC chief N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka and chairman of TPCC Election Commission Coordination Committee Marri Shashidhar Reddy said that the seizure of ₹18.67 lakh allegedly from Raghunandan Rao’s relatives and Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy rushing to hush-up things confirmed the distribution of money.

Earlier on October 15 too an amount of ₹ 40 lakhs was seized from four persons, Similarly, the Congress had brought to the notice of the Election Commission on October 22 about the offer of bribe made by Finance Minister T Harish Rao to a Congress party mandal president Laxman Goud to join the ruling TRS party, the letter said.

The Congress leaders alleged that the TRS party would resort to influence the voters with the the use of money and liquor and that the local police would not be in a position to check their movement as they are totally under the influence of the State government and are under threat by the TRS leadership.

The Congress recalled that in the past large sums of money were seized during the RK Puram Assembly bye-election in December 2017 and the Vellore Lok Sabha election in April 2019 in Tamil Nadu. In both those instances EC had cancelled the elections. At least the EC can deploy Central forces and direct officials to be fair, the letter said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cec-asked-to-deploy-central-forces-for-dubbak-bypoll/article32956725.ece
185,2020/10/27,BJP seeks Governor’s intervention to ‘safeguard democracy’,"‘Gross misuse of State machinery in Dubbak bypoll’

Telangana Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday urged Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, to seek an explanation from Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, on the “misuse” of State machinery in Dubbak, instruct Director General of Police (DGP) to immediately transfer all police officials of Siddipet involved in “high-handedness” against the BJP workers, leaders and family members of party candidate M. Raghunandan Rao and transfer the Siddipet Police Commissioner for “abusing” party chief and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar.

In a memorandum to the Governor, a copy of which was released to the media, the BJP leaders — city president and MLC N. Ramchander Rao, general secretary G. Premananda Reddy — also requested her to “appoint a team of observers to Dubbak to take stock of the situation and submit the report” and “advise the Chief Electoral Officer of Telangana to take due cognisance of the incidents at Siddipet and Dubbak and initiate appropriate action to ensure fair polls”.

Drawing her attention to the “gross misuse of power and brazen attempts to muzzle the opposition space” in the ongoing campaign for the Dubbka Assembly segment bye-elections, the leaders charged that the local officials instead of providing a level-playing have adopted an extremely “lopsided” stance to benefit the ruling party. The officials have been behaving as TRS agents right from the beginning of the campaign with police not allowing BJP leaders to canvas in the constituency.

The police have been rounding up youth and confining them to the police station for hours to “psychologically browbeat and emotionally blackmail the families”. Raids are being conducted across the homes of various party leaders and functionaries without any due standard operating procedures being followed “just to please the political bosses”. Mr. Sanjay Kumar was halted outside Siddipet and forcibly bundled into a vehicle unceremoniously.

“TRS has been taking recourse to these intimidation-tactics as the defeat stares at them in Dubbak. It is sheer frustration at its worst. It is now evident that a fair bye-election would not be possible in Dubbak. The TRS government wouldn’t allow it under the circumstances, we seek your intervention as you are the constitutional head to safeguard the democracy in the State,” they appealed in the memorandum.

Earlier, the party delegation complained to the Election Commission that the ‘anganwadis workers’ who were designated as booth level officers instead of confining to the election work have been warning the people of not getting pensions if they do not vote for the ruling party Hence, it was necessary to remove them from the posts and appoint others.

186,2020/10/27,Verdict in Warangal murders today,"Nine members of migrant workers’ families were killed by single person

A local court in Warangal will pronounce on Wednesday the judgment in the sensational case of nine murders committed by a single person five months ago in Gorrekunta village of Geesukonda mandal here.

Despite the constraints due to COVID-19, the investigators and the prosecutors got the trial of the case completed in less than five weeks in the First Additional District and Sessions Judge court of Warangal. Final arguments by public prosecutor Mokila Satyanarayana Goud and defence counsel T. Sridhar were completed on October 22.

The PP sought capital punishment to the accused Sanjay Kumar Yadav citing it as the rarest of the rare case. All, the accused and the nine victims were members of migrant workers’ families. The nine victims were Maqsood Alam, 50, his wife Nisha Alam, 45, their sons Shabaz Alam, 21, Sohail Alam, 20, daughter Bushra Alam, 22, Bushra’s three-year-old son, Sriram, 35, Shyam, 40 and Shakeel, 40.

Twenty-four-year-old Sanjay of Bihar came to Warangal six years ago for livelihood. He used to work in a gunny bag making unit where Maqsood worked and lived with his family. Sanjay developed relationship with a woman Rafika of West Bengal, also a migrant worker, living close-by. She was a relative of Maqsood’s wife.

Rafika used to live with her three children separately. Police stated that Sanjay promised to marry Rafika but eventually cast an eye on her teenaged daughter. Suspecting that he had sexually assaulted her daughter, the woman questioned him.

To get rid of her, Sanjay led her to believe that they had to meet his elders in Bengal. Along with Rafika, he boarded a train in March third week. On reaching Tadepallygudem, he administered sleeping pills to her. When she fell unconscious, he threw her from running train and returned to Warangal.

Maqsood’s wife grew suspicious of Sanjay’s contradictory replies after asking him about Rafika. She threatened to approach police if he failed to reveal facts. Worried of consequences, he decided to eliminate Maqsood’s family. He mixed sleeping pills in the food prepared for the birthday party of one of Maqsood’s children. Shyam, Sriram and Shakeel, who lived in the same compound, also had food and fell unconscious along with Maqsood and his family members.

Sanjay allegedly dumped the nine unconscious people in an abandoned well nearby. “We are confident of securing stringent punishment to the accused,” said Mamnoor ACP Shyam Sunder who investigated the case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/verdict-in-warangal-murders-today/article32956621.ece
187,2020/10/27,Defeat TRS to bring KCR out of Pragathi Bhavan: Ponnala,"KCR reacts only at time of elections, says former PCC chief

Former PCC president Ponnala Lakshmaiah has said that the defeat of TRS candidate in Dubbak bye-elections will force Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to come out of Pragathi Bhavan and see the plight of people under his regime.

Mr. Lakshmaiah said declaration of support price for maize and assurance of DA to employees is people’s moral victory. “KCR made insulting remarks on employees but no sooner did the aspect of elections arise he came down to announce DA for them.”

This realisation is because of the fight of the Congress party on behalf of farmers as well. “It is only when he is confronted did he satisfy the farmers and employees. So, it is only when we defeat KCR in Dubbak elections he will fulfil all the assurances he made. If we fall into his trap and elect TRS again he will conveniently cheat us once again,” he claimed.

Claiming that every decision of the Chief Minister is linked to elections, Mr. Ponnala said the decision to give ₹ 10,000 per household in Hyderabad was taken keeping in view elections to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). On the other hand CM has not taken any decision on the recent crop damage due to heavy rains that left the farmers in agony.

“So the breakdown of the ‘car’ is what will bring land for Dalits, double bedroom houses, Aarogya Sri, jobs for every home, reservations for Muslims and tribal people and the promise of free education from KG to PG,” the former minister said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/defeat-trs-to-bring-kcr-out-of-pragathi-bhavan-ponnala/article32956584.ece

The number of major lift schemes was 125 and there are another 20 medium lifts and 13 small lifts in the State.

Further, the inventory states that number of tanks and ponds in the State is 38,510, check dams number another 8,021 and the length of tunnels is 175 km. There are 1,26,477 structures on canals, 108 sub-stations, 64 rain gauges and 21 river gauges.

The details of the inventory were unveiled at a workshop organised here on Tuesday. Speaking at the meet, Principal Secretary (Irrigation) Rajat Kumar said the inventory of all assets of the Irrigation Department was a prerequisite for proper reorganisation the department as also the management of assets.

He stated that the exercise had been taken up following the directions of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to prepare a comprehensive inventory on all assets of the department, including the land acquired. He stated that the officials of the Irrigation and Revenue departments had been working on preparing the inventory for the last six months and it had a taken a proper shape now.

Mr. Rajat Kumar complimented the officials of Irrigation department for completing the task of inventory preparation, which was not done for the last 50 years, in just six months. The inventory would now allow proper project monitoring system (PMS).

However, completion of preparing the inventory was not the end of work but it had to be kept updated from time to time to make their hard work meaningful, Mr. Rajat Kumar suggested to the Irrigation officials. The inventory would also play a significant role in the reorganisation of the department that is on cards. He asked the engineers of the department from assistant executive engineer level to chief engineer to be part of the PMS.

Details of the inventory forming part of the PMS were explained by Godavari Basin Commissioner Madhusudan Rao. After detailed discussion, it was decided that the details of land to be acquired from now on had to be updated by May 31 every year along with lands leased to other departments.

190,2020/10/27,How can police link money in Siddipet to the Dubbak bypoll: Revanth,"BJP divided between KCR supporters and those opposing him, says Congress leader

Congress MP A. Revanth Reddy has said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was now experiencing the high-handedness of the Telangana police with the assault of BJP State president Bandi Sanjay by a police officer.

“When we lodged several complaints with the Central government after the Congress leaders were ill-treated and manhandled by the police, for frivolous reasons, there was no response. Now they are realising when their State president himself faced it,” he said during an informal interaction with reporters here.

Mr. Reddy said the Mr. Sanjay was not only the party president but was also a public servant being a Parliament member. “How can the police obstruct him when he wanted to visit Siddipet? Cases should be booked against the police for obstructing a public servant,” he argued.

The Congress leader also questioned the role of police saying how can they relate anyone to the contestant in Dubbak and that too in a different town, Siddipet where elections were not being held. If it was illegal money the Income Tax department should have been alerted. “That money could have been of TRS supporters as well,” he claimed.

Claiming that the BJP was divided as KCR supporters and those against his policies, he said even the response of Union Minister of Home for State G. Kishan Reddy to the incident clearly indicated that. “Instead of seeking an inquiry into the incident, he played it soft. YSRCP MP Raghurama Krishnamraju has been given protection with Central forces while requests for the same from Bandi Sanjay and Nizamabad MP D Arvind are pending. What does that indicate,” he asked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/odj2fi/article32956517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY28REVANTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/how-can-police-link-money-in-siddipet-to-the-dubbak-bypoll-revanth/article32956347.ece

All the development in Dubbaka was done when her husband represented it and the ruling TRS party ignored the constituency totally after it came to power, said Vijayalakshmi, widow of late minister Cheruku Muthyam Reddy.

During her campaign at Chegunta village in support of her son and Congress candidate Cheruku Srinivas Reddy, she said he was the face of the constituency and it was known across the combined Andhra Pradesh through Muthyam Reddy’s work. She recalled how several educational institutions came up in the backward constituency and said it was time for them to repay the gratitude to the late leader who worked for the masses and led a simple life.

Along with former Cherial MLA, Kommuri Pratap Reddy and TPCC secretary Banda Chandra Reddy and local Congress leaders Laxmi, Ganesh and Ali, she visited several areas in Chegunta on Tuesday. Mr. Pratap Reddy said people themselves recalled the development done by Mr. Muthyam Reddy, who served as a minister in Y.S. Rajashekar Reddy government.

The late leader’s wife, Vijayalakshmi asked the people to analyse the promises made by the TRS government and their delivery.

With the stage set for the official launch of Dharani, the land record information management system, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar has instructed the officials of the Revenue Department to extend hassle free registration and mutation services to the citizens.

The staff and officials should live up to the expectations for the successful implementation of Dharani portal by providing services in simple, transparent and speedy manner. The Chief Secretary attended a training programme conducted for officials of Revenue and Registration departments on Tuesday ahead of the launch of the portal by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on October 29.

The Chief Secretary said that under the Dharani Portal, registration and mutation would be completed with immediate effect and the portal was set to become a trendsetter in the country. Mr. Somesh Kumar, who made a power point presentation on the highlights of Dharani, explained to the officials about slot booking, citizen open portal, successor modules and partition modules. The roles and responsibilities of tahsildars and data entry operators was also explained in detail.

He said that the role of the Revenue department would increase manifold as they would henceforth function as joint sub-registrars. The Revenue department employees should work as a team and bring a good name to the government.

The government was committed to resolve issues pertaining to the Revenue department and it was decided to set up a State-level control room to address the technical issues.

Similarly, district-level technical support teams would be constituted to resolve issues arising at that level, he said instructing the officials concerned to put in place necessary infrastructure at all the offices.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/training-of-officials-on-dharani-portal-held/article32955691.ece
193,2020/10/27,Dubbak by-election | Embarrassment to BJP as police release money seizure video clips,"When the MRO and police personnel were stepping out of the house, screaming BJP workers surrounded the authorities, overpowered them and snatched away part of the seized cash.

Bharatiya Janata Party leaders received a rude jolt on Tuesday with the Siddipet police, whom it accused of planting money to implicate its candidate Raghunandan Rao in Dubbak by-election in a false case, releasing video clips of seizing the money.

Controversy erupted on Monday after police seized ₹18.67 lakh from the house of Surabhi Anjan Rao, a close relative of Mr. Raghunandan Rao. While BJP leaders charged that police planted money in Mr. Anjan Rao’s house to falsely implicate Mr. Raghunandan Rao, TRS leaders responded saying it was case of pot calling the kettle black.

Also Read TRS, BJP continue to spar at Dubbak

The allegations and counter charges continued till late in the night with TV channels airing visuals of a policeman carrying a bag of cash and some BJP activists snatching away part of the cash seized from the police. On Tuesday, Siddipet police released three video clips substantiating their claim that they genuinely seized the money from Mr. Anjan Rao’s house.

The video footage showed police seizing a total sum of ₹18.67 lakh from Mr. Anjan Rao’s house. “Our police teams accompanied local Mandal Revenue Officer who went to Anjan Rao’s house. The cash was seized from that house and even Anjan Rao signed the panchanama report,” Siddipet Police Commissioner Joel Davis told The Hindu over phone.

The Commissioner said that Mr. Anjan Rao claimed that the money was sent to him by a person called Jitende Rao. “The audio of the video footage was not clear but Anjan Rao suggested that the money was meant for Dubbaka by-election and supposed to be distributed in small amounts,” Mr. Davis said.

On learning about the cash, several BJP activists gathered outside Mr. Anjan Rao’s house and some entered the house premises. When the MRO and police personnel were stepping out of the house, screaming BJP workers surrounded the authorities, overpowered them and snatched away part of the seized cash.

Later, police realised that BJP workers took away ₹12.80 lakh of the seized money. The remaining sum of ₹5.87 lakh was still with the police. Two criminal cases were registered in connection with the currency seized and the subsequent snatching of the money.

A case of alleged influence and bribery was registered following seizure of the money. The second case was booked over snatching of the money. Five persons were already arrested by the police in connection with snatching money. Police suspect that 20 persons were involved in the money snatching incident. Others are being identified.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/dubbak-by-election-embarrassment-to-bjp-as-police-release-money-seizure-video-clips/article32954159.ece

A day after a tense situation was witnessed in Siddipet and Dubbak over the recovery of money from a relative of BJP candidate M. Raghunandan Rao, major political parties continued campaigning without hurdle.

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao, addressing a motorcycle rally at Toguta mandal headquarters on Tuesday, said, ""It was nothing but a self goal by BJP. Why did Raghunandan Rao go from Dubbak to Siddipet to Dubbak within half an hour if the money did not belong to him?

They are in frustration and reacting with that. They will distribute money in the next few days, be careful”.

BJP leaders alleged that the TRS has been trying to fix them as it fears defeat in bye-election.

195,2020/10/27,An ink that cured a creative block,"Kerala-based artist Thaj Backer says a naturally-made Arabic ink helped him overcome a creative slowdown

Thaj Backer

On one of his strolls around his hometown Ponnani, artist Thaj Backer stumbled on something that ignited his curiosity: a vendor who sold Arabic ink to the madrassas in the locality. The ink, he found, was used in the ceremonial initiation of a child into the world of letters. Intrigued, Thaj began to learn more about it.

Available only in a few shops selling the Quran in the area, this natural ink is made using burnt rice and tree gum (as a binder) and is powdered. “I believe there is a certain honour in working with local resources and this ink was a discovery,” says Thaj, who wasted no time in buying it.

“The powdered ink is usually mixed with either boiled and cooled water or rose water. The mixture is then poured into a piece of muslin, tied and hung up so that the pure ink is collected,” he says. It is jet black and flows easily on paper, Thaj adds.

Inktober series

He has been felicitously using the Arabic ink for the drawings he has been doing as part of Inktober, a month-long global art challenge, which has artists showcasing their inking skills. Participating artists are expected to submit one drawing a day through the month, based on the theme provided.

The themes are random — ‘crow’, ‘hope’, ‘trap’ and ‘coral’ for example. Thaj says the series helped him overcome a creative block he had been experiencing ever since the pandemic broke out.

“This has been an especially taxing period for artists who derive inspiration from human interactions and travel. For me, art is not a solitary activity. I derive a lot of energy from people for my work,” he says. “I am the kind of person who takes off on a train journey without a particular destination in mind when I feel stressed. It is stifling not being able to do that.”

Inktober series

Thaj is also a performing artist. For the past 10 years has explored mediums that include theatre, painting, sculpture and designing.

He was part of ABC (Art by Children), a programme initiated by the Kochi Muziris Biennale Foundation to run research-driven art interventions for children and art educators to help them reach their creative potential.

Inktober series

Thaj is currently working on a series that explores the nuances of romance, the body and nudity. Titled Udalukalude Unmaadam, (Ecstasy of the Body), it has over 60 works done in charcoal on paper.

Thaj will be part of a virtual residency organised by House Conspiracy, an arts organisation based in Australia. He will also be showcasing his work in an online group show, ‘For the Kisans’.

Inktober series

The works done for Inktober will be documented as a personal collection and can be viewed at @Thajbackerofficial on Instagram.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/kerala-based-artist-thaj-backer-uses-a-locally-made-arabic-ink-for-inktober-series/article32950257.ece

197,2020/10/27,Gupkar alliance opposes new land laws,"Alliance will fight the anti-Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh measure on all fronts, says PAGD spokesman Sajad Lone.

The People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), an amalgam of around seven political parties in Jammu and Kashmir, on Tuesday opposed the amendments made to the land laws by the Centre.

“We strongly condemn the repealing of the J&K land laws and stripping the permanent residents of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh of exclusive right to acquire and hold immovable property. It is a massive assault and grossly unconstitutional. The Alliance has vowed to fight the anti-Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh measure on all fronts”, PAGD spokesman Sajad Lone said.

Mr. Lone, also the chairman of the Peoples Conference (PC), said these measures were clearly “designed as an attempt to pre-empt the outcome of the challenge before the Supreme Court”.

NC general secretary Ali Muhmmad Sagar termed the new land laws “unacceptable”. “We will fight against this deceitful move”, he said.

Daylight robbery of land: CPI(M)

CPI(M) leader M.Y. Tarigami said the move was a design to disempower the people of J&K further and put their land on sale for corporations. “It is a daylight robbery of land in the name of integration, development and security”, he added.

Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari said he would take up his reservations before the top leadership in the country. “Better would have been if such laws were left to or dealt with in consultation with the duly elected government in J&K. Any laws, which do not safeguard the interests and rights of people of J&K, would be unacceptable to our party”, he said.

According to a spokesman of the Congress, it goes contrary to the repeated assurances by the BJP. “It’s another betrayal by the BJP of people of J&K, as time and again they were assured that their right to land and jobs shall be protected at all costs. The Congress always sought the restoration of statehood with constitutional safeguards for lands and jobs and will intensify its struggle”, the spokesman said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/76v9am/article32238592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN31SAJADLONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gupkar-alliance-opposes-new-land-laws/article32956834.ece
198,2020/10/27,Congress slams JD(U)-BJP govt. over Munger firing,"Police action on idol immersion group leaves 1 dead, several injured

The Congress on Tuesday slammed the JD(U)-BJP government in Bihar for the police firing and baton charge in Munger district on a group taking a Durga idol for immersion, in which one person has died and several persons were injured.

Sharing a video which has gone viral on social media, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala asked, “Will the BJP-JD(U) government thrash Goddess Durga worshippers like animals?... This baton charge and police firing on worshippers was done on the indications of BJP-JD(U).”

“Why Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keeping mum over it?..where are these union ministers like Giriraj Singh, Ravi Shankar Prasad, R K Singh and Nityanand Rai,” asked the Congress leader.

According to officials, with voting for Assembly polls scheduled in Munger in the first phase on October 28, the police had insisted that organisers immersing idols do so before midnight of October 26. However, the group allegedly baton charged by the police refused to follow the directions and threw stones on policemen which triggered a clash. According to the police nearly 25 policemen, including officers-in-charge of Sangrampur and Qasim Bazar police stations, were injured.

The police also recovered some country-made weapons and cartridges from the site of the clash. Around 30 people too were injured in the clash and allegedly one person Anurag Poddar, a local resident, was killed in firing. The seriously injured persons are Saurabh, Chandan, Ashutosh and Chhotu.

“We’re collecting video footage of the spot to identify troublemakers... Adequate forces have been deployed to ensure no further untoward incident happens,” Munger Superintendent of Police Lipi Singh told media, adding that “over 30 people have been detained and were being questioned.”

Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan also attacked the Nitish Kumar government over the incident.

“Opening fire on devotees shows the Talibani rule of Nitish Kumar government,” Mr Paswan said and demanded “strict action against the policemen responsible for the incident”.

Communist Party of India leader Kanhaiya Kumar who is campaigning in Begusarai, too demanded “a thorough and strict probe against police personnel who opened fire on the people”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/2yg39s/article32281216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THMain2NTHGGS17LA9IT3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/opposition-slams-jdu-bjp-govt-over-munger-firing/article32956425.ece

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath at an election rally in Unnao on Tuesday said those involved in cow slaughter would be dealt with sternly within the boundaries of the law.

While Mr. Adityanath had in the past too issued such warnings, his remarks come in the backdrop of the Allahabad High Court recently observing that the anti-cow slaughter law was being misused against innocent persons in the State.

In Bangermau, which is scheduled to hold bypoll along with six other seats, Mr. Adityanath said: “If anyone [is involved] in cow slaughter, that person will land in jail.”

“We will protect gau mata [mother cow] at all costs,” the CM said, adding that his government would deal with ‘sternly’ those accused of the crime “within the boundaries of law”.

In an order dated October 19, the HC observed that “accused persons in cow slaughter cases in U.P. continue to be in jail for an offence that may not have been committed at all and which is triable by a Magistrate Class I, having a maximum sentence up to 7 years. UP Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, 1955 is being misused against innocent persons,” it said as it granted bail to Rahmuddin, a person from Shamli accused of alleged cow slaughter and in jail since August though there was no allegation against him in the FIR.

Mr. Adityanath’s speech was also laced with references to the Ram Mandir and dilution of Article 370.

On the one hand he claimed that there had been no riots in the State since his government came to power in 2017. On the other, referring to the protests against the Citizenship [Amendment] Act last year, he said the damage to public property was recovered from the accused by selling their houses.

“We also put up their posters,” Mr. Adityanath said, referring to the controversial “name and shame banners” put up in Lucknow of those activists and persons accused of vandalism and arson during the protest last December but who are not yet convicted of the alleged crime.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nz7juh/article32956165.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YOGIKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/yogi-adityanath-issues-warning-against-cow-slaughter-at-bypoll-rally-in-unnao/article32956166.ece
200,2020/10/27,"It is not about individuals, but what ideology you stand for, says Sachin Pilot","Rajasthan Congress leader takes on former colleague Jyotiraditya Scindia in M.P. bypolls

Having weathered the political turmoil in Rajasthan just a few months ago, Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Tuesday hit the campaign trail for byelections to 28 Assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh, aimed at bolstering the party’s prospects especially in the Gwalior-Chambal region, a stronghold of former party colleague Jyotiraditya Scindia. The nation needs the Congress as a pan-India, political presence which is centrist, secular and forward-looking, says Mr Pilot.

Who is the main adversary of the Congress in the byelection. Is it Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan or Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia?

It is the Bharatiya Janata Party.

Mr. Scindia and you were party colleagues and considered its young leaders. While he has quit, you’ve stayed on with the Congress despite the political turmoil in Rajasthan. What kept your faith in the party?

The Congress has given me quite a lot in the last 20 years of public life. And I believe it is the core ideology of the party that this nation needs, a pan-India political presence which is centrist, secular and forward-looking. Yet it upholds traditions. It is the only party I believe that has the thought capacity and the bandwidth to take on the BJP.

You’re on the opposite sides today. How does it feel to be campaigning in this changed scenario against the BJP?

I am campaigning for my party, and Mr. Scindia is campaigning for his. It’s not about individuals, but more about what ideology you stand for. And one is free to make political choices. I have campaigned in Madhya Pradesh in the past too, and I have been asked by the party to do so again.

What has changed since the 2018 Vidhan Sabha election. How is the party’s strategy different this time?

That was an election after five years; this one is being forced in Madhya Pradesh. And people are not going to choose just between individuals but two parties. I am absolutely confident we will get an overwhelming majority.

The previous election was about anti-incumbency after 15 years. The BJP was voted out, yet they wriggled their way back to power. Questions are now being asked, more by the public than the Congress, why they were back in the government again after being voted out.

There is a continuing string of defections from within the Congress. Recently, the party in Madhya Pradesh lost its 26th MLA since March to the BJP. What do you believe are the causes?

We all know who is instigating these defections and what is the purpose behind it. But people are smart. Ultimately every MLA and MP is accountable to those he or she represents. So they will be the final judge of whether it was right or wrong.

The party has not had a full-time president for more than a year. Do you think it’s affecting the organisation at the grassroots?

I think that matter has been settled in the last working committee. And it has decided to conduct elections for the party president soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7s104h/article32955982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PILOTKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/it-is-not-about-individuals-but-what-ideology-you-stand-for-says-sachin-pilot/article32955983.ece

BJP MP Jyotiraditya Scindia on Tuesday said he met his former colleague and senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot in Gwalior and that he is welcome to the State to campaign for the November 3 by-elections.

Mr. Pilot arrived in Madhya Pradesh for a two-day visit on Tuesday morning to campaign for Congress candidates in Gwalior, Shivpuri, Bhind and Morena districts of the State.

“I met him in Gwalior and welcomed him,” Mr. Scindia, who quit the Congress in March and joined the BJP, told PTI. “Madhya Pradesh has the tradition of welcoming everyone on its soil, therefore he [Pilot] is also welcome here,” said Mr. Scindia, the scion of the erstwhile Gwalior royal family.

Asked whether his [Pilot’s] presence will make any difference in the bypolls, Mr. Scindia said in a democracy everyone has the right to campaign. By-elections to 28 Assembly seats in the State are scheduled on November 3. Twenty-five of these seats fell vacant after sitting Congress MLAs resigned and joined the BJP, leading to the collapse of the Kamal Nath-led State government.

Most of these rebel Congress MLAs were considered close to Mr. Scindia. Besides, three seats fell vacant due to the death of their sitting MLAs.

To a question on his meeting with Mr. Pilot before the political crisis in Rajasthan a few months back, Mr. Scindia said he does not want to comment on the internal affairs of the Congress.

In July, Mr. Pilot and 18 other MLAs rebelled against the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan, leading to Mr. Pilot’s sacking as Deputy Chief Minister and State party chief.

Following his patch-up talks with senior Congress leaders, the political crisis was resolved after nearly a month.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/h0y7ib/article32955963.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27IN-SACHIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/madhya-pradesh-bypolls-jyotiraditya-scindia-meets-sachin-pilot-in-gwalior/article32955964.ece
202,2020/10/27,Madhya Pradesh bypolls | EC sends M.P. Minister Imarti Devi notice,"Her remarks about a rival candidate were allegedly in violation of Model Code of Conduct

The Election Commission on Tuesday sent a notice to BJP candidate and Madhya Pradesh Minister Imarti Devi over remarks about a rival in the ongoing byelections campaign that were allegedly in violation of the Model Code of Conduct and the EC’s advisory against any speech or actions against the dignity of women.

The EC gave the BJP candidate from Dabra 48 hours to respond to the notice. According to the transcript of her address that was shared on social media, Ms. Devi spoke about an unnamed rival who was from Bengal and went ‘paagal’ (insane) after stepping down as Chief Minister. She also said perhaps his “mother and sister” were ‘items’ in Bengal.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday hit out at the Uttar Pradesh government for rising prices of vegetables during the festival season.

She alleged that the rising prices have wreaked havoc on the common man during the festival season. “Vegetable prices are skyrocketing. Work and businesses are already stalled”, she tweeted in Hindi.

Ms Vadra also put a chart with the retail prices of vegetables in Lucknow that showed onions selling at ₹ 80 a kg and capsicum between ₹100 and ₹120 a kg. While potato and tomato prices ranged between ₹50 and ₹ 60, pointed gourd (parwal) was sold at ₹ 80

204,2020/10/27,"Chouhan announces memorial of Rani Padmavati, slams Bhansali film","Ahead of bypolls, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday announced that a memorial of Rani Padmavati will be built in Bhopal, and cases against those who protested against the film “Padmavat” would be withdrawn.

Speaking at the traditional ‘shastra pujan’ (weapon worship) programme of the local Rajput community, Mr. Chouhan said land for the memorial has been earmarked at Manuabhan Ki Tekri in Bhopal.

He attacked Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s controversial 2018 period drama “Padmavat”, calling it a “blow to society’s honour”, and noted that it was banned in Madhya Pradesh.

“We have decided to withdraw all the cases registered during the protest against the film in the state as the protesters were opposing injustice,” he said.

Lessons on Rani Padmavati will be included in school curriculum from the next academic year, the BJP leader said.

Annual prizes of ₹ 2 lakh each will be instituted in the names of Maharana Pratap and Rani Padmavati to felicitate men and women who have exhibited exemplary bravery, Chouhan announced.

Bypolls to 28 Assembly seats will be held in the state on November 3.

Bhansali’s film on queen Padmini/Padmavati had faced stiff resistance from Rajput organizations which alleged that it distorted history.

Meanwhile, some members of the audience including women shouted slogans against caste-based reservations when the chief minister’s speech was nearing its end.

Standing on chairs, they also shouted “Mamaji (as Mr. Chouhan is popularly known) give jobs to everyone”.

Mr. Chouhan left the venue even as slogans continued.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/c94x99/article32955324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/chouhan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/chouhan-announces-memorial-of-rani-padmavati-slams-bhansali-film/article32955325.ece

A case has been registered against BJP leader Pankaja Munde and 40 to 50 others for allegedly violating prohibitory orders during her rally at Sawargaon in Maharashtra’s Beed district, police said on Tuesday.

Ms. Munde visited Bhagwan Bhakti Gad in Sawargaon on October 25 and addressed an online Dussehra rally from there.

An offence has been registered at Amalner police station against Pankaja Munde, Rajya Sabha MP Dr. Bhagwat Karad, MLAs Monica Rajale and Megnana Bordikar and others who attended the rally, an official said.

“Only five persons had been permitted to be present and prohibitory orders had been enforced in district. The rules were violated, which is why the offence was registered under section 188 (disobeying an order issued by a public servant) and other provisions of the IPC and Disaster Management Act,” the official told.

Meanwhile, reacting to the development on Monday night, Ms. Munde tweeted, “I went to Bhagwan Bhati Gad after obtaining necessary permission and now this offence has been registered.

207,2020/10/27,Samajwadi Party adds prominent members ahead of U.P. by-polls,"A former Union minister, a former BSP MP, and the brother of a Minister in the current BJP State government are among the latest additions.

A former Union minister, a former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MP, and the brother of a Minister in the current Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday became the latest additions to the Samajwadi Party (SP).

Saleem Shervani, former five-time MP from Budaun who also served as a Union minister during 1996-1998, joined the SP in the presence of the party president Akhilesh Yadav.

Mr. Shervani, who first became an MP in 1984 on a Congress ticket, was sent to Parliament as an SP candidate four times, in 1996,1998, 1999 and 2004, before he shifted his loyalty back to the Congress.

In the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, he contested on a Congress ticket from Budaun, securing over 51,000 votes, but that was enough to spoil the chances of the SP as he cut into the base votes of the SP candidate Dharmendra Yadav, who lost to Sanghamitra of the BJP by less than 20,000 votes.

Along with Mr. Shervani, former BSP MP from Akbarpur in east U.P. Tribhuvan Dutt; Indrapal Singh Pal, brother of BJP minister Ajit Singh Pal; and Chaudhary Naseem Begum, wife of BSP MLA from Hapur Aslam Chaudhary, joined the SP. Former MLA from Hardoi’s Shahbad seat Asif Khan Babbu, Zilla Panchayat Chairperson from Maharajganj Prabhu Dayal Chauhan, and retired Provincial Civil Service (PCS) officer B.K. Saini also joined the SP.

The boost to the SP comes at a time when the State is holding by-polls to seven Assembly seats, which observers say would test the ruling party as well as the Opposition parties in establishing their respective positions in the build-up to the 2022 Assembly elections.

“People of U.P. are ready to remove this government. When the people get an opportunity, you will see how this government is removed,” said Akhilesh Yadav, SP chief.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tjmiuq/article31453985.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AKHILESHYADAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/samajwadi-party-adds-prominent-members-ahead-of-up-by-polls/article32954393.ece
208,2020/10/27,Meghalaya staring at economic blockade from organisations in Assam,"COVID-19 restrictions have upset traders

After Nagaland and Mizoram, Meghalaya is staring at an economic blockade from organisations in Assam.

While conflicts of different kinds made truckers keep off the roads to Nagaland and Mizoram, the latest cause of friction is Meghalaya’s alleged obsession with COVID-19 restrictions that have denied entry to traders from Assam.

At least 40 organisations, including the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU), All Rabha Students’ Union and All Bodo Students’ Union, have threatened to block all points of entry to western Meghalaya’s Garo Hills from October 29 if the Meghalaya government “does not get over its pandemic obsession”.

These organisations questioned the logic behind the Meghalaya government’s decision to ban entry of Assam traders when people from Meghalaya have been trading in border areas of Assam.

“When the Ministry of Home Affairs has asked the States not to impose restrictions on trading and movement of people, there cannot be any logic behind the Meghalaya government’s decision to keep our people out,” a local AASU leader said.

Leaders of some of these organisations met the authorities of western Assam’s Goalpara district for resolving the issue.

“I had a meeting with my counterpart of North Garo Hills district (in Meghalaya, adjoining Goalpara). I have also written to the Meghalaya government and all the Garo Hills district heads. They are in discussion for possible relaxations,” said Varnali Deka, Goalapara’s Deputy Commissioner.

Officials in Meghalaya said a “mutually beneficial” decision would be taken soon.

Parts of Nagaland had suffered a temporary blockade when five truckers’ unions imposed an “indefinite economic blockade” on September 29. The blockade was to protest the killing of an Assam-based trucker in Nagaland’s Dimapur on September 22.

Truckers in Assam had also stopped plying to Mizoram following an inter-State boundary dispute that led to violence. The blockade was lifted on October 22.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/meghalaya-staring-at-economic-blockade-from-organisations-in-assam/article32953326.ece
209,2020/10/27,Woman shot dead by stalker outside college in Faridabad,"Attempted abduction had failed after victim offered resistance

A 20-year-old woman was shot dead outside her college by two men in broad daylight during an abduction bid in Ballabgarh here on Monday. Both the accused have been arrested.

Nikita, a B.Com Final Year student, had gone to college in the afternoon for an examination and was accosted by the duo when she came out from the premises. The closed circuit television (CCTV) footage of the incident shows one of the accused, with his face covered, trying to push her inside a white car, but she is seen offering stiff resistance. A woman passer-by tried to intervene to help her, but the man shot Nikita point-blank with a country-made pistol and drove away with his friend in the car. The incident took place on the road outside the college in full public view.

Nikita was taken to a private hospital and died during treatment. She was a resident of Sanjay Colony in Sector 23 in Faridabad.

Her brother, Naveen, in the First Information Report (FIR), identified one of the assailants as Tausheef. He said the accused had been harassing his sister for long and bore a grudge against her.

The family was informed about the incident by one of their relatives over phone around 3.30 p.m.

Tausheef, a resident of Gurugram’s Sohna, was arrested late on Monday night after a five-hour-long search operation across three districts, including Faridabad and Palwal. His friend Rehan, a resident of Nuh, was arrested on Tuesday. Both arrests were made from Nuh.

Faridabad Police Commissioner O. P. Singh said a case had been registered against Tausheef in 2018 for kidnapping Nikita, but her family later gave an affidavit to withdraw it. He said the matter was transferred to the Crime Branch and a Special Investigation Team was constituted for thorough investigation.

Mr. Singh said the police were serious about ensuring maximum punishment to the accused and all evidence, including forensic and digital, would be gathered during the course of the investigation to build a strong case. He said there was CCTV footage of the incident, and also eye-witnesses to the murder.

210,2020/10/27,"Now, outsiders can buy land in Jammu and Kashmir","Centre notifies Jammu and Kashmir land laws, omits ‘permanent resident’ as criteria

People as well as investors outside Jammu and Kashmir can now purchase land in the Union Territory (UT) as the Centre on Tuesday notified new land laws for the region, ending the exclusive rights of locals over the land granted under now abrogated Article 370.

Under the newly introduced J&K Development Act, the term “being permanent resident of the State” as a criteria has been “omitted”, paving the way for investors outside J&K to invest in the UT.

Also read | Jammu traders for “riders” on land purchase, investments by outsiders

The Centre has been arguing that Article 370 hampered development in the U.T. as investors were unable to purchase land prior to August 5, 2019.

Laws for Ladakh soon

The Centre is likely to notify separate land laws for the UT of Ladakh soon.

“We want that like other parts of India, industries should be set up in J&K. My government is committed to peace, progress and prosperity”, Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha said.

Under the ‘transfer of land for the purpose of promotion of healthcare or education’, the government may now allow transfer of land “in favour of a person or an institution for the purpose of promotion of healthcare or senior secondary or higher or specialized education in J&K”.

According to amendments made to “The Jammu & Kashmir Land Revenue Act, Samvat, 1996”, only agriculturists of J&K can purchase agricultural land. “No sale, gift, exchange, or mortgage of the land shall be valid in favour of a person who is not an agriculturist,” it reads.

Fact check | What is true and what isn’t on J&K, Article 370

The Restriction on Conversion of Agricultural Land and Process for Permission of Non-Agriculture clause, however, puts conditions on the use of agricultural land. “No land used for agriculture purposes shall be used for any non-agricultural purposes except with the permission of the district collector”, it reads.

Under a new provision, an Army officer not below the rank of Corps Commander can declare an area as “Strategic Area” within a local area, only for direct operational and training requirements of the armed forces.

The introduction of the UT of J&K Reorganisation (Adaptation of Central Laws) Third Order, 2020 by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has resulted in the repeal of at least 11 land laws in vogue in J&K earlier, including the J&K Big Landed Estates Abolition Act that had resulted in famous ‘Land to tiller’ rights.

Also read | Is Jammu and Kashmir underdeveloped as stated by Amit Shah?

NC, PDP oppose move

Political parties, including the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) opposed the move.

“The amendments have put J&K up for sale. With these new laws in place, tokenism of the domicile certificate has been done away with, as purchasing non-agricultural land has been made easier. These new laws are unacceptable to people of J&K”, NC vice president Omar Abdullah said.

Editorial | Scrapping J&K's special status is the wrong way to an end

PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said, “Yet another step that’s part of nefarious designs to disempower and disenfranchise people of J&K. From the unconstitutional scrapping of Article 370 to facilitating loot of our natural resources and finally putting land in J&K up for sale. Such brazen measures reinforce the need of people of all three provinces of J&K to fight unitedly”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5r3ter/article32957079.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Srinagar-Chinar-garden,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/now-outsiders-can-buy-land-in-jammu-and-kashmir/article32952629.ece
211,2020/10/27,Bear cubs ride ‘palanquin’ to planned freedom in Arunachal,"Handlers cover 8 km through fast-flowing streams and dense foliage to shoulder the trip of two orphaned cubs deep inside an acclimatisation centre in Pakke Tiger Reserve.

Loki and Hela, two orphaned Asiatic black bear cubs, were individually driven almost 1,000 km in customised vehicles to the Centre for Bear Rehabilitation and Conservation (CBRC) during the COVID-19 lockdown in May.

The centre adjoins the 861.95 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in Pakke-Kessang district of Arunachal Pradesh.

But the two cubs probably had the ride of their life more than a fortnight ago — in bamboo ‘palanquins’ shouldered by their handlers through fast-flowing streams and dense foliage in PTR, their home to be.

There are numerous streams within the park that appear benign but are difficult to cross even in winter when there’s less water. | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Few are as acquainted with the PTR as forest employees Tinku Kino and Kampu Kino and CBRC’s Doluk Dagong and Biri Aman. Familiarity with the landscape, however, was no insurance against a false step during a 20 km journey — an 8 km stretch on foot — for shifting the cubs from the CBRC to an acclimatisation centre deep inside the PTR.

“Rivers such as Kameng, Pakke and Pasanala serve as natural boundaries for much of the PTR. There are numerous streams within the park that appear benign but are difficult to cross even in winter when there’s less water,” PTR’s Divisional Forest Officer T. Pali told The Hindu.

“The rivers provide us a ring of protection, helping us manage with 41 anti-poaching camps. But these very rivers and streams prevent us from covering more ground. It is not easy to negotiate the rivers, especially while carrying bear cubs in a palanquin-like cage,” he said.

According to wildlife veterinarian Panjit Basumatary, the cubs may take about six months at the acclimatisation centre before they can be safely released in the PTR like 26 other cubs reintroduced in the wild since 2003, when the CBRC was set up by International Fund for Animal Welfare and Wildlife Trust of India (WTI).

Loki, the male cub, was found by a farmer near Dekapam village near Pasighat in East Siang district (of Arunachal Pradesh) on March 30. Hela, the female cub, was rescued from Patgaon village in Assam’s Kamrup district on March 26.

“The cubs could not be brought to the CBRC immediately due to the COVID-19 restrictions. While forest officials in Assam knew how to deal with Hela, my predecessor Madhurjya Borah advised the Dekapam farmer over phone on handling Loki until both could be brought to the CBRC,” Mr. Basumatary said.

The two cubs travelled to the CBRC almost at the same time but they did not meet until August 26. It took a few days for them to get over their aggression towards each other.

“Animals take time to adjust to new environment and overcome the proximity to humans at the rehabilitation centre. Hopefully, they will adapt soon to the acclimatisation centre for an early release into the wild,” Mr. Pali said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ajg898/article32952278.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bear-palanquin,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bear-cubs-ride-palanquin-to-planned-freedom-in-arunachal/article32952279.ece
212,2020/10/27,Train runs non-stop from UP’s Lalitpur to Bhopal to rescue ‘kidnapped’ girl,"It turns out that the girl was taken away by her father.

An express train with an ‘abducted’ minor girl was made to run non-stop on Monday for more than 200 kilometres from Lalitpur railway station here till Bhopal with police there in waiting to catch hold of the kidnapper, who eventually turned out to be the child’s father.

Police said the father apparently had a fight with his wife and left home with their three-year-old girl around 3 am on Monday. The couple’s home is said to be close to the Lalitpur station. It appears that the girl’s mother had all along known that her husband had taken away their daughter.

Yet, the mother informed the RPF jawans posted at the Lalitpur railway station in the early hours on Monday that her child had been ‘kidnapped’ and the ‘kidnapper’ had boarded one of the trains to escape, Lalitpur Superintendent of Police (SP) Capt M.M. Beg said.

On going through CCTV footage, it was found that one person with the girl was boarding Rapti Sagar Superfast Express which had just left for Bhopal, the SP said, adding that RPF personnel informed their inspector at the Jhansi Junction who in turn informed the operating control room at Bhopal and requested the train be allowed to run non-stop to avoid the ‘kidnapper’ from escaping.

Instead of halting at the next scheduled stop of Jhansi, the express train then continued on till Bhopal, 241 kilometres away from Lalitpur station.

As soon as the train reached Bhopal Junction, officials from the RPF, Government Railway Police and Railways managed to recover the girl and the ‘kidnapper’ was taken into custody. During questioning, they got to know that the ‘kidnapper’ was the girl’s father, the SP added.

The father and the girl were brought back to Lalitpur later in the day and reunited with the family, police said adding that the couple were counselled following the incident.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bosnsn/article32952113.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07HYVGN06-EXPREGP86978114jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/train-runs-non-stop-from-ups-lalitpur-to-bhopal-to-rescue-kidnapped-girl/article32952092.ece
213,2020/10/27,Income Tax Department cracks down on large network of entry operators,"Papers showing entries of more than ₹500 crore seized

The Income-Tax Department has conducted searches against a large network of “accommodation entry” operators and allied entities in Delhi and its neighbouring region of Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa.

The searches carried out on Monday at 42 locations, during which ₹2.37 crore in cash and jewellery worth ₹2.89 crore were found along with 17 bank lockers, led to seizure of papers showing entries of more than ₹500 crore.

“The search has led to seizure of evidence exposing the entire network of the entry operators, intermediaries, cash handlers, the beneficiaries and the firms and companies involved,” said the department in a release.

Several shell entities were used by the entry operators in question for laundering unaccounted money and cash withdrawals against fake bills issued and unsecured loans given.

Their personal staff, employees and associates were made dummy directors/partners of these shell entities and all bank accounts were managed and controlled by the entry operators.

“Statements of such entry operators, their dummy partners/employees, the cash handlers as well as the covered beneficiaries have also been recorded, clearly validating the entire money trail,” said the agency.

The suspects were also found to be controllers and beneficial owners of several bank accounts and lockers opened in the name of their family members, trusted employees and shell entities.

The operators were managing the accounts and lockers allegedly in collusion with the bank officials.

The agency said the beneficiaries had made huge investments in the real estate in prime cities and in fixed deposits running into hundreds of crores.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/i-t-raids-hawala-operatives-across-delhi-goa-other-states/article32951435.ece

A member of a gang involved in highway robberies was killed allegedly in an encounter with the Special Task Force (STF) of the Uttar Pradesh Police on Monday, officials said.

Five people were killed after two country boats capsized in a water body here on Monday, police said.

The bodies of five men, all of whom were residents of Beldanga, were fished out of Dumni water body, a senior police officer said.

The incident took place around 5:15 pm on Monday, October 26, 2020. The two boats were carrying around 10 people each for Durga idol immersion, he said.

217,2020/10/27,Sena needs certificate from us on Hindutva: BJP,"The Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday said the Shiv Sena needed to take certificate of Hindutva from it and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

The attack on Sena president and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray came a day after he challenged the BJP on its ideology of Hindutva and said he did not need certificate of it.

“The Shiv Sena’s Hindutva has now become contaminated as it joined hands with the Congress and the NCP for the sake of power. Hindutva of the Sena and the RSS cannot be compared. The Sena will have to take certificate of Hindutva from the BJP and the RSS,” said BJP MLA Ashish Shelar.

Mr. Thackeray had slammed the BJP who had termed that his Hindutva was different than that of his father the late Bal Thackeray. “Your idea of Hindutva is clanging pots and ring bells. Ours is not like that,” he had said. Mr. Thackeray had made reference to the Dasara speech of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, asking the BJP to take lessons from him. Mr. Shelar claimed that the Sena chief made wrong reference of Mr. Bhagwat’s speech.

“The clanging of pots and claps was not about Hindutva but to encourage corona warriors. Linking it with Hindutva was unfortunate,” said the BJP leader.

BJP Rajya Sabh MP Narayan Rane said Mr. Thackeray had no right to lay claim on Hindutva as he betrayed it by allying with the Congress and the NCP for the sake of power. Mr. Rane was with the Congress for over 10 years and worked as a senior minister in two successive State governments from 2004. He switched sides to join the BJP in 2018.

Replying to Mr. Thackeray’s dare to destabilise his government, Mr. Shelar said the Chief Minister himself was unsure about the stability of his government. “Our leaders have already dared him to first concentrate on governance. He is claiming religion is being used to dethrone him. But this government will fall by its own deeds, so no need to bring religion here,” he said.

Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) partner NCP slammed the BJP for using derogatory language against the Chief Minister. “No matter how much one blabber. But one has to follow decorum while speaking about the CM,” said Minority Affairs minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/d3v56a/article32948551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ASHISHSHELARBJP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sena-needs-certificate-from-us-on-hindutva-bjp/article32948552.ece

In a bid to check coronavirus, the Rajasthan government will bring a bill in the upcoming assembly session to make wearing face masks mandatory, a release said.

According to the release, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said coronavirus can be avoided only by adopting measures such as masks, social distancing and washing hands repeatedly.

The CM said the state government is considering making wearing face masks mandatory and a bill will be brought in this regard in the assembly session. Interacting with district collectors, college principals and other officials through a video conference held to review the outcome of a movement against coronavirus, Mr. Gehlot said every section of society should join the government to make this campaign successful.

He said the campaign will not be completely successful until people realise the need of wearing face masks.

The chief minister also appealed to people to celebrate Diwali without firecrackers, saying pollution caused by them increases the risk for coronavirus patients.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a virtual dialogue with the beneficiaries of the ‘PM Street Vendors Atmanirbhar Nidhi Scheme (SVANidhi scheme)’ from the State on Tuesday.

The State government said Uttar Pradesh had secured the first rank in all three categories under the scheme — applications, sanctions and disbursal of loans.

Till October 26, loans had been disbursed to 2.59 lakh beneficiaries. While 6.4 lakh applications were submitted, loans were sanctioned to 3.62 lakh vendors.

Deepak Kumar, Principal Secretary, Urban Development Department, said there were 3,050 registered vending zones in the 651 urban local bodies in the State. More than 7.78 lakh vendors had been identified in these zones.

While the State has more than 6.68 lakh registered vendors, the government said it had issued certificates to 4.70 lakh vendors.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/eas3yx/article32948540.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STREETVENDORS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/modi-to-interact-with-beneficiaries-of-street-vendors-scheme-in-uttar-pradesh/article32948541.ece
221,2020/10/27,"Post-COVID, loss of income acute among trafficking survivors: study","The women have little support of institutional schemes such as MGNREGS, it says

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the earnings of Fatima (name changed), a survivor of human trafficking, rescued in 2017. Already she was grappling with the legal process. She was earning some money from a self-help group of survivors in the Canning subdivision of West Bengal’s South 24 Parganas district when the pandemic affected her plans.

“I have had no earning for the past six months and there is little hope that I will be able to make some money in the coming months. My Father, a driver who works in Kolkata, has no earning either and we have to support a family of six,” she said.

The 24-year old, a leader of then Indian Leadership Forum Against Trafficking, said the plight of other trafficking survivors was no different and they were also facing economic hardship.

In an attempt to understand the distress among survivors of trafficking and other vulnerable women, several non-government organisations associated with Tafteesh and Survivors Leadership Programme conducted a vulnerability analysis of 236 survivors of human trafficking, survivors of commercial sex work and women in sex work from West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. The women were identified by organisations such as Goranbose Gram Bikas Kendra, HELP, Partners for Anti Trafficking and Sanjog. The vulnerability assessment was carried among 120 women from West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas district and 116 women from Prakasam, Guntur and Krishna districts of Andhra Pradesh.

“Out of the 236 survivors assessed, 79 [or 33%] had no income of themselves before the lockdown, the number increased to 183 [or 77.5%] after the lockdown. Similarly, the number of no income for their family heads before lockdown was 65 [27.5%], which got increased to 206 [87%] following the lockdown,” the study revealed.

Saroj Kumar Pattnaik, associated with Tafteesh, an access to justice programme under which the analysis was done, said the study revealed that the women had little support of institutional schemes such as the MGNREGS.

“Only 26 or 11% of the women had reported to have job cards. This means even if government schemes such as MGNREGS start in their localities they might not get any work in the absence of a job card,” Mr. Pattnaik said.

No ration card

On the access to food grains under the public distribution system (PDS), of the 236 vulnerable women, 41 reported that they did not have a ration card, while 25 of them had neither ration card nor a coupon to receive free or subsidised ration during the lockdown period. About 56 reported that they had no access to regular ration supplied under the PDS.

The loss of income coupled with little institutional support has put the women with no option but to turn to moneylenders.

“Of the 236 women, 143 had taken some loan before the lockdown, and another 106 joined them in taking loans to cope with the financial crisis. The loan amount varies from as low as ₹1,500 to ₹4,30,000,” the study revealed.

Loans with high interest

The study revealed that women from Andhra Pradesh were reported to have taken heavy loans with high interest rates from private moneylenders compared to women from West Bengal. “There are at least 28 women from Andhra Pradesh who appear to be at very high risk in terms of repayment of debts that can lead to bondage, servitude and harassment by the moneylenders,” the report added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uvd990/article32948536.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRAFFICKINGSURVIVORS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/post-covid-loss-of-income-acute-among-trafficking-survivors-study/article32948537.ece
222,2020/10/27,Campaigning picks up in Manipur for bypolls,"The ruling BJP, NPP and Congress are major players

Campaigning for the November 7 by-polls to four Assembly constituencies in Manipur has gained momentum. The major players are the ruling BJP, the opposition Congress and the National People’s Party, a coalition partner.

Chief Minister N. Biren said on Monday, “The BJP-led coalition government will wipe out all tears of the have-nots. The coalition government was saved by six Congress MLAs who had tendered resignations from the party. It is in recognition of their support that some former Congress MLAs were inducted into the Ministry.”

Campaigning for the BJP candidate of the Wangoi constituency, Oinam Lukhoi, Mr. Biren said people should decide whom to vote for in the constituency. Though he had resigned from the Congress, Mr. Lukhoi was now made Cabinet Minister. “Should people vote for a candidate who may never become a minister, forgetting that the BJP candidate is now already the Agriculture Minister,” he asked. Mr. Biren said some opposition members were making personal attacks on Mr. Lukhoi.

The Chief Minister said his government was trying to stamp out corruption. He said, “Several persons were killed in the past in controversial encounters. But there has been no such killings under the present ministry.”

Deputy Chief Minister Yumnam Joykumar of the NPP said the party candidate would defeat the BJP in Wangoi. He however said the NPP would not withdraw support to the coalition ministry. The four NPP MLAs were made Cabinet Ministers. Recently two Ministers were sacked. Despite the intervention of national NPP president Conard Sangma, who is the Chief Minister of Meghalaya, the two Ministers were not reinducted.

Addressing a campaign meeting for Abdul Nasir, a former Congress MLA, who along with five others had resigned, Mr. Biren said people should stop taking bribes from candidates in elections if they wanted to check corruption. The Chief Minister said that during its three and a half years of rule, the coalition government had implemented many developmental works which the Congress could not do. Referring to the ban imposed on Mr. Nasir and his supporters from entering some villages in the Lilong constituency, Mr. Biren said if the ban was not lifted the government would have to use force to ensure unrestricted entry for electioneering.

Reacting to Mr. Biren’s charge, Congress MLA and spokesperson K. Ranjit said, “Though some other BJP members may not be aware of the developmental works done by the Congress, at least Mr. Biren should be knowing all details. Mr. Biren had been a Cabinet Minister or chairman of various corporations and boards in the 15 years.” It was only a few months ahead of the last Assembly elections that Mr. Biren had defected to the BJP.

Congress candidate in Wangoi, Salam Joy, said some community centres were constructed while he was MLA. But the present government had constructed just the verandahs of these centres to “inaugurate them as the BJP achievements.” Congress leaders charged that for the BJP, political power was more important than the lives of people. They said there was a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths. They claimed that there was no social distancing in the election meetings addressed by BJP leaders.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/campaigning-picks-up-in-manipur-for-bypolls/article32948521.ece
223,2020/10/27,EC advises Kamal Nath not to use words like ‘item’ again,"Issues notices to BJP leader Vijayvargiya and a Congress leader for code violation

The Election Commission on Monday found that former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath had violated its 2019 advisory to politicians to refrain from any speech or action against the dignity of women when he referred to BJP candidate and Minister Imarti Devi as an ‘item’ while campaigning for the byelections in Dabra, Gwalior, on October 18.

The EC advised Mr. Nath not to use such language while the Model Code of Conduct was in force, according to the order. It had issued a notice to Mr. Nath on October 21 for his statement on Ms. Devi.

The EC order quoted Mr. Nath’s response to the notice as saying the comments were not pre-meditated or meant to dishonour a woman.

“It was an admonition of the political scenario which is replete with drama. There was no malice or intent to disrespect a lady,” he said, adding that he had expressed regret the day after the speech.

Citing his experience of 40 years as an MP, Union Minister and Chief Minister, he said: “The hubris of electioneering cannot and must not ignore the life record of an individual.”

The EC found that Mr. Nath had violated its April 29, 2019 advisory and advised him not to use such words.

The EC also issued notices for alleged MCC violations to BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya and Congress leader Sajjan Singh Verma. Mr. Vijayvargiya had referred to Mr. Nath and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh as “chunnu-munnu” during a rally in Sanwer, Indore on October 14, while Mr. Verma called Mr. Vijayvargiya ‘raavan’ at a rally there the next day.

224,2020/10/27,B.Tech. student-turned-militant surrenders in Pulwama district,"He was made to talk to his parents at Kashmir encounter site

A 22-year-old engineering student-turned-militant was convinced to surrender amid a raging encounter, which left his associate dead, in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district on Monday evening.

A “specific tip-off” led the security forces to encircle Saqib Akbar Waza, a B.Tech student of a varsity in Punjab, and his associate, Showker Ahmad, in a built up area of Noorpora village of Awantipora area in Pulwama.

The first few minutes of exchange of fire resulted in the killing of Ahmad, a recycled militant who was trained in Pakistan and shunned violence only to rejoin the Hizbul Mujahideen last year. The remaining armed militant was Waza.

“When we came to know about Waza, a local, being alive and trapped, we halted the fire at the house. A special team had already contacted the family. The parents were brought to the encounter site to have a conversation with their trapped son. We positioned ourselves patiently to ensure he surrenders,” IGP Vijay Kumar told The Hindu.

Within 35 minutes, Waza, who was carrying a pistol and a grenade, surrendered before the security forces.

“Waza, a resident of Batagund was pursuing his B.Tech when he was reported missing on September 20 this year. His gun-toting images also surfaced online. He is the fourth youth to surrender during a live encounter this year,” IGP Kumar said.

The J&K police and the Army, of late, have started a surrender policy for the local youth, where parents of the trapped militants are called to the encounter site to convince them to surrender.

“We appeal to parents of recently recruited youth to persuade their sons to surrender and leave the path of violence.”

Despite the security forces killing around 190 militants this year, the militant recruitments have not shown any significant let up in the Kashmir valley.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9qljb0/article32948485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201026-WA0015,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/btech-student-turned-militant-surrenders-in-pulwama-district/article32948486.ece
225,2020/10/27,Scindia’s candidates grapple with sullen BJP workers,"For BJP worker Chattur Singh, the task of convincing voters to back a candidate who till recently was with the Congress is fraught with challenges.

“Well, I am not sure why Maharaj (Jyotiraditya Scindia) and his supporters changed sides. Maybe because they felt ignored?” he ventures when confronted by a voter attending Mr. Scindia’s public meeting in Shivpuri district.

Foes-turned-friends

As in 25 of the 28 Assembly seats up for byelection in Madhya Pradesh, older BJP workers in Pohari Vidhan Sabha constituency have reluctantly buried the hatchet to canvass for their former adversaries, against whom they had campaigned vehemently just two years back in 2018.

On the podium in Chharch village, BJP leader Prahlad Bharti found himself standing awkwardly next to candidate Suresh Dhakad, who had defeated him on a Congress ticket. And Mr. Scindia’s strong influence, which he successfully thwarted twice to be elected to the Assembly, now looms over him.

“The BJP is one family, and we welcome those who join us with open arms,” said Mr. Bharti with a smile pasted on his face. “The sangathan is supreme and we will follow its instructions. Anyway Mr. Dhakad was elected for five years so why not let him continue? At least the BJP government is back.”

Image diminished

The stature and public appeal of Mr. Scindia or ‘Maharaj’ as he is referred to had visibly declined after he switched sides in March, admitted Mr. Singh.

“It’s like he had a permanent government job, but now holds a contractual one. There is no certainty. How do we resolve the inner conflict to support those we’ve fought against so far? The leadership has told us we needed to be patient. Apna time aayega (Our time will come). ”

On the banner in the backdrop, portraits of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Mr. Scindia appear on the opposite ends, as if emblematic of the former acrimonious political relationship. “Why are both of them holding rallies separately? This still shows some differences are yet to be resolved,” said Devesh Mohne, a college student. On October 23, Mr. Chouhan addressed the public in the same village.

A group of 300 BJP workers from Baran district, 150 km away in Rajasthan, are also eagerly listening to the speakers. “Even Sachin Pilot should have joined the BJP. All young leaders within the Congress are being ignored,” said Surendra Khatik.

Squatting along with another villager, Tarasia Adivasi is miffed at being forcibly told to attend the meeting. “We will anyway vote for whoever we want. I have just come to see the helicopter,” he said. For tribals in the constituency, land grabbing by upper castes was the major poll issue, he said. An owner of 65 bighas, Mr. Tarasia gets to cultivate only five.

“The Congress dared me to take to the streets, and I am here now. We will make them taste the dust,” Mr. Scindia concludes, amid roaring applause and cheers, and rushes to the helicopter. The mass of 5,000 villagers abruptly breaks off, and they perch atop tree branches and rooftops to wave at the helicopter as it takes off, leaving a cloud of dust behind.

“We will vote in the wind’s direction,” quipped Mausambi Adivasi. “I didn’t understand what was said from the stage, as they were all shouting in the microphone. I will press the hand button and vote for Mr. Scindia,” said Ms. Mausambi, unaware of the leader’s new political affiliation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/676i6o/article32948469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHIVRAJSINGHCHOUHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/scindias-candidates-grapple-with-sullen-bjp-workers/article32948470.ece

227,2020/10/27,Non-opening of temples makes priests financially desperate in Odisha,"To vent their anguish, they have decided to sound gongs or ring bells in front of all temples tomorrow

The unusual decision to sound gongs or ring bells in front of all temples across Odisha on Wednesday as a mark of protest against non-opening of temples may make the State government see red. But, by doing so, priests across the State would be venting their anguish.

Ask Bhabani Shankar Mishra (54), a priest at the Balunkeswar Temple at Dandamukundapur in Puri district, why he would sound gongs and ring bell which is not part of any worship.

“Since March 22, I have been confined to my home. The income has since dried up. Before COVID-19 struck, I used to earn from the donation of devotees. My family did not face any food shortage as the monthly income of around ₹10,000 was enough,” said Mr. Mishra.

During past eight months, the priest’s family had to borrow from their relatives as it had exhausted the little savings they had. His family members have resorted to making brooms and selling them in market.

In Mayurbhanj district, Kameswar Tripathy, who heads the Odisha Mandir Sevayat Sangh — a priests’ body — also works as a priest in the Shree Jagannath Temple at Baripada.

“The situation is worsening every passing day. I usually earn ₹50,000 during the rath yatra celebration. The lockdown snatched my major income of the year. The income supplements the meagre, yet critical regular income which is about ₹8,000 to ₹9,000 from temple,” said Mr. Tripathy.

August and September mark the beginning of the festival season in Odisha. Apart from the regular income from temples, the priests are invited to homes for personal pujas. With fear of COVID-19 reigning, devotees have postponed the rituals to next year.

“This is a big blow. Many priests, who live in towns in rented accommodation, have left for their villages where they have little land for taking up agriculture,” said the president of the priests’ body.

To assuage anger in Shree Jagannath Temples, Puri and the Lingaraj temple, Bhubaneswar, where a large number of priests are organised, the government has released some instalments of ₹5,000 in the past couple of months. However, no package has been announced for other priests in the State.

Urging the government to take immediate steps to open temples in accordance with the COVID-19 guidelines, Janardan Pattajoshi Mohapatra, head of the Chhatisa Nijog, a sevayats’ body in the Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri, said, “Priests are in acute financial crunch. Only opening of temples will solve the crisis. Once devotees start visiting temples, the economy around the religious institutions would get back to normalcy.”

On October 8, the State government initiated steps to open temples. “Districts Collectors were asked to consider the possibility of opening up places of worship for public of all religious faiths where compliance to guidelines is feasible and report to government. They may prefer graded opening to containing the disease,” Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy had tweeted.

Besides, the government had directed the temple administration of Shree Jagannath Temple, Puri and other major temples under the Endowments Commission to prepare a plan of action for opening temples for worshippers adhering to the COVID-19 regulations.

Though the Collectors were asked to submit reports after consultations with all stakeholders in 10 days, there has been no word on opening the temples. The delay now makes priests desperate.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/non-opening-of-temples-makes-priests-financially-desperate-in-odisha/article32948256.ece

Congress general secretary Priyanka Vadra held a meeting with the weavers of Varanasi through video conferencing to discuss the problems faced by them, the Congress said on Monday.

Ms. Vadra is learnt to have told the weavers that the Congress would stand with them in their fight against ‘injustice’.

The weavers of part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Lok Sabha constituency complained about losing electricity connection after being unable to pay the high power tariffs.

231,2020/10/27,‘Effort on to block child pornography’,"Google responds to HC query on removing ‘offending images’

Search engine major Google has informed the Delhi High Court that there is an ongoing effort to develop more effective automated tools to prevent hosting of child pornographic content on its platforms.

Google said that when any child pornographic content hosted on its platform is reported, it is removed immediately. “However, it is difficult to prevent uploading of the same prior to the content being reported,” senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, appearing for Google said.

Google was responding to High Court’s query on removing “offending images” of children and preventing them from resurfacing.

‘Technology limitations’

Mr. Poovayya submitted that Google does use artificial intelligence and Machine Learning to prevent the uploading of child pornographic content in respect of any known and reported image. “However, the said technology has its limitations because a known hash file or a digital fingerprint is then applied for removing images with the same value,” the senior advocate said.

The senior advocate explained that even a minor change in the properties of the image would enable it to evade discovery or action through the automated processes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/effort-on-to-block-child-pornography/article32947885.ece
232,2020/10/27,Anti-traffic pollution drive launched in Delhi,"State govt. seeks support of people

Environment Minister Gopal Rai, while launching the ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign in all the 70 Assembly constituencies on Monday, said that everyone, including MPs, MLAs, agencies and the residents should participate in the campaign and contribute on their behalf, leaving their political affiliations aside, to combat the problem of air pollution in the Capital.

He said that a single vehicle contributes to 15%-20% pollution while idling at traffic signals and the aim is to reduce that percentage by switching vehicle ignitions off. Mr. Rai also announced that from November 2, the government will be taking this campaign forward in all the 272 wards in the city, so that more and more people can participate.

“The Delhi government believes that active participation from the people is required to combat the problem of air pollution. The impact of the campaign and other measures will be ascertained by the scientists,” he also said.

The Minister, answering a question regarding whether the government was considering issuing any advisory on pollution for the people in the coming days said the governments and all agencies concerned such as the Supreme Court, the EPCA, the DPCC were monitoring the situation and would take action wherever needed.

He alleged that the Delhi government had not received a positive response from the BJP MLAs and MPs.

Air quality ‘very poor’

Meanwhile, the Capital’s air quality remained in the ‘very poor’ category for the fourth consecutive day as a layer of toxic haze lingered over it. A central government monitoring agency said the air quality was likely to remain in the same category till October 31.

The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was 16% on Monday; 19% on Sunday and 9% on Saturday.

234,2020/10/27,Rohit’s omission from Oz tour shrouded in mystery,"More than 24 hours after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the squads for India’s forthcoming tour to Australia, the mystery over Rohit Sharma’s exclusion from the squad for all three formats seems to have compounded.

Rohit, India’s vice-captain in ODIs and T20Is, has missed Mumbai Indians’ last two games in the Indian Premier League owing to a left hamstring injury, as made official by his franchise.

Since then, there has been no word on Rohit’s fitness. But minutes after the BCCI announced the squads on Monday evening, stating that the BCCI’s medical team “will continue to monitor the progress of Rohit”, the batsman had a full-fledged batting session in UAE. In fact, the manner in which Mumbai Indians put out an edited video of his batting across its social media handles gave rise to speculation on whether Rohit was making a statement with the bat.

No explanation

Barring the one-line update in the BCCI statement, there has been no explanation from anyone involved in the team. The player himself, the selectors, the BCCI, even the franchise have remained tightlipped over Rohit’s exclusion. As legendary batsman Sunil Gavaskar so eloquently put it in Monday’s post-match show on Star Sports, the fans deserve to know the reasons behind Rohit not being in the team for Australia. Instead of being transparent, the Indian cricket machinery has continued to operate in conspicuous ways.

Was Rohit omitted from limited-overs squads due to the injury or does he not meet fitness criteria for international cricket? Did he make himself unavailable, citing the life in a bio-bubble, possibly without the family in Australia? Or was he ruled out of the ODIs and T20Is due to fitness concerns and was not considered for Tests? To add to it, is it the end of Rohit’s IPL campaign?

Hopefully, the BCCI, headed by a former India captain, will put an end to all the questions soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/s6f5mm/article32878248.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ROHITSHARMA-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/rohits-omission-from-oz-tour-shrouded-in-mystery/article32957492.ece
235,2020/10/27,India gets extra warm-up game before Oz Tests,"CA accedes to BCCI request; first practice match will clash with white-ball series

India is set to play two warm-up games — instead of one, as originally scheduled — ahead of the four-Test series in Australia.

According to the provisional itinerary shared by Cricket Australia (CA) with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the tourists were offered a solitary practice match, a day-night affair in Adelaide from December 11 to 13, ahead of the pink-ball Test at the Adelaide Oval from December 17.

But considering that there has been no First Class cricket for the Indian players since the conclusion of the Ranji Trophy in March, the BCCI had asked for an additional warm-up tie. The Hindu understands that CA has acceded to the request.

Cramped schedule

Since the itinerary is cramped, the first warm-up game — to be played either in Canberra or at a venue in Sydney — will clash with the limited-over series.

It will be followed by a three-day floodlit tie at the Sydney Cricket Ground before the team departs for Adelaide on December 14.

The change of venue for the day-night practice game was to ensure that the preparation for the Test at the Adelaide Oval isn’t affected.

Besides, since the Australian broadcaster is keen on televising the match, it will have to be hosted at an international venue.

All the 32 India cricketers selected across three formats, including the four back-up bowlers, along with the coaching and support staff, will travel to Australia together immediately after the conclusion of the Indian Premier League on November 10.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/4er4pk/article32957482.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28VIRAT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-gets-extra-warm-up-game-before-oz-tests/article32957483.ece

237,2020/10/27,‘Think I let the noise get to me last time around’,"Starc says ‘time will tell’ if his extra preparation will help in the India series

Pace spearhead Mitchell Starc says he let the noise get to him when India toured Australia two years ago but “couldn’t care less” now as he gears up for the upcoming home Test series against Virat Kohli’s team.

Starc had received flak for his performance against India after taking 13 wickets in the four-Test series in 2018-19.

“I think I let the noise get to me, to be perfectly honest, which is a big reason why I don’t pay attention to anything now,” Starc was quoted by cricket.com.au.

“By the end of that summer I was just running in and trying to bowl as fast as I could, just to focus on one thing. It worked out for the last Test of that summer.”

Australia lost its first-ever Test series at home to India in 2018-19. India is set to tour Australia again for three T20Is, as many ODIs and four Tests next month.

“The noise just got to me and (so did) people who really didn’t have any part of the team, (who voiced) opinions which they’re entitled to, (but) now I just couldn’t care less what people say,” said Starc.

“I just don’t need to listen to that stuff anymore. I don’t read it and I’m a happier person for it. As long as I have people around me who I trust talking to, and (in) the changeroom as well that positive reinforcement is there no matter what.”

Technical changes

Starc said he made some technical changes during last year’s Sheffield Shield games ahead of the home series against Pakistan.

Starc, who had skipped the IPL to be with his family, said only “time will tell” if his extra First Class preparation would hand him an advantage in the upcoming series.

“To have a couple of Shield games now, to just focus on that and continue to reinforce some of the little changes I’ve made over the last couple of months, it’s a good chance to make that happen against some good domestic players.

“The wickets have been quite flat here so it’s just a chance to hone those skills on wickets that aren’t offering too much.

“You can look at it either way — the guys over in the IPL are over there playing an extremely high level of cricket, but I get to hone my skills with the red ball.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/8c225e/article32957091.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28STARCY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/think-i-let-the-noise-get-to-me-last-time-around/article32957092.ece
238,2020/10/27,I’ve battled depression: Johnson,"Found it tougher since retiring, says former Aussie pacer

Former Australia pacer Mitchell Johnson has opened up on his battle with depression, saying he continues to struggle with his mental health even after retiring from all forms of cricket in 2018.

“Through my cricket career I actually just dealt with it (depression), it’s just about me now actually moving forward and taking it upon myself to be active with certain things, to keep my mind going,” Johnson said in Channel 7’s SAS Australia.

“I’ve found it tougher since retiring from cricket. All of a sudden, you’re not doing as much. You sort of lose your purpose a little bit,” he added.

Johnson, who took 313 wickets from 73 Tests, retired from Tests in 2015, but continued to play for three more years in the IPL and Big Bash.

Transition phase

“I struggle with, probably, confidence at times. I’m in that transition now where I’ve been out of playing cricket for about two years,” the 38-year-old said.

Asked if he had found retirement hard, Johnson replied: “Yeah, plenty of times. I found out I’ve got depression, but I think that was something I’ve had even from a younger age.

“It (cricket) sort of blocked things out in a way. It sort of hid the depression, but there was a lot of times where you would go back to your room, you’re away from family and you start to dwell on things.”

Lifestyle plays a role

Johnson feels a cricketer’s lifestyle is at times responsible for such a condition.

“You have your moments where you struggle with it really bad and it can be tricky when you’ve got a lot of time to think about things,” he said. You’ve just got no control whatsoever and your mind starts playing those tricks on you, you start thinking of the worst,” the left-arm pacer added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ecoyim/article32957060.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28JOHNSON,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ive-battled-depression-johnson/article32957061.ece
239,2020/10/27,"IPL 2020 | Saha, Warner deflate Capitals before Rashid has them in knots","Emphatic 88-run win keeps Sunrisers’ playoff hopes alive; Shreyas’ men suffer third successive loss, drop to third after net run rate takes a hit.

Chasing a target of 220 is never easy but Delhi Capitals lacked intent and eventually faltered against Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Dubai International Stadium on Tuesday.

SRH beat DC by 88 runs to stay alive in the tournament.

Leading from the front

David Warner led from the front, scoring a 34-ball 66 (8x4, 2x6) and then taking two catches to help dismiss the in-form Shikhar Dhawan — for a golden duck off Sandeep Sharma’s third ball — and Marcus Stoinis, off Shahbaz Nadeem, inside the PowerPlay.

He even took the right DRS call towards the back end of the game, which saw the end of Rishabh Pant (36, 35b, 3x4, 1x6).

Ajinkya Rahane (26, 19b, 3x4, 1x6) had tried to build a partnership with Shimron Hetmyer in the chase, but that was cut short by leg-spinner Rashid Khan, who dismissed them both.

Rashid’s 17 dot balls

Rashid’s three for seven strangled DC. He bowled 17 dot balls to finish with an economy-rate of 1.75.

Earlier, Warner and Wriddhiman Saha (87, 45b, 12x4, 2x6), who replaced Jonny Bairstow, punished the DC bowling.

Speeding to 77 in the first six overs without losing a wicket, SRH recorded its best PowerPlay performance of the season, with Warner taking on fast-bowler Kagiso Rabada to score 22 in an over.

The southpaw smashed four fours and a six to completely change the momentum. The signature slash cut, the swipe over cow corner and the familiar flat-batted strikes left the Delhi fielders clueless.

Saha — playing his second game of the season — swept the spinners and pulled the quicks with gusto.

Warner and Saha added 107 runs off 58 balls before R. Ashwin sent down a loopy off-break to entice the left-hander; the mistimed lofted shot found extra cover.

Saha looked set for his second IPL hundred, but he mistimed a length ball from Anrich Nortje to be caught at mid-off. Ashwin and Nortje were the only DC bowlers among the wickets.

With this huge win, SRH has moved to sixth on the table. Its net run rate (0.396) is the best of the chasing pack. DC’s third straight loss puts it in jeopardy. Although still third with 14 points, its remaining games are against Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore, the top two.

The all-pervasive COVID-19 threat notwithstanding, the Boxing Day Test between India and Australia might feature crowds with the Victoria government saying that it is “very confident” of having fans in the stands for the much-awaited clash.

After being in lockdown for over four months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Melbourne will soon start reopening following a reported decline in the number of cases in the State. The India-Australia Test series starts mid-December with the traditional Boxing Day Test lined up for December 26.

The head of government in the Australian State of Victoria, Daniel Andrews said he is “very confident” that fans will be able to attend and the administration is “working towards” it.

“The Boxing Day Test of course is very different because that is some way off. I am very confident that we will get a crowd at the MCG for the Boxing Day Test,” Andrews was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.

“I don’t know how big it will be but there will be a crowd, that’s the advice that I have, that’s what we’re working towards.”

India’s tour of Australia will consist of three T20Is, as many ODIs and four Test matches. It is set to get underway from November 27.

Sydney and Canberra are likely to host the white-ball leg while the four-match Test series is starting with a D/N pink-ball match in Adelaide from December 17. Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney are the venues of the other three Tests.

The Indian team will travel to Sydney immediately after the IPL ends on November 10 but there are still some issues related to the bio-secure arrangements which are being discussed by the two boards.

242,2020/10/27,"Feels surreal, says Varun Chakravarthy on his surprise India call-up","“My basic goal was to play in the team regularly and perform and contribute to their wins.”

“It feels surreal,” said the architect-turned-mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy after he got a maiden India call-up for the T20 series in Australia following his exploits for Kolkata Knight Riders in the ongoing IPL.

The 29-year-old, who only started taking his spin bowling seriously in 2018, said he was not expecting to be picked in the national team. He has played only 12 T20s and featured in a lone First-Class game.

“After the match got over I got to know (of my selection into the Indian team). I keep using the same word again and again, it feels surreal,” he told BCCI.tv after the game against Kings XI Punjab on Monday night.

“My basic goal was to play in the team regularly and perform and contribute to their wins. Hopefully I’ll be able to do the same for India. I am not very active on social media and I have to thank the selectors for keeping their faith in me. I don’t really have words.”

Varun took a five-wicket haul against Delhi Capitals earlier in the competition, forcing the national selectors to take notice.

“I pretty much started my spin bowling in 2018, that’s when I got my breakthrough in TNPL, it’s been high and lows - last year, I didn’t get many chances and I injured myself, I’m grateful for making a comeback this year,” he said.

“I have been working hard, but the motivation and faith has come from a lot of people around me,” Varun had said at the post-match presentation after the game against Capitals.

“Around 2015, when I was not making a lot of money (the switch from being an architect to becoming a cricketer), was freelancing and wasn’t able to meet my needs, I thought I would do something different, that’s when I turned to cricket.

“I still do it, I like that as well (being an architect),” he had said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/fdvjsw/article32954270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VARUNKBjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/feels-surreal-says-varun-chakravarthy-on-his-surprise-india-call-up/article32952999.ece
243,2020/10/27,"IPL 2020 | Mumbai Indians to face-off against RCB, winner to secure play-off berth","Virat Kohli’s team suffers an injury scare on the bowling front with pacer Navdeep Saini suffering a split webbing.

Rohit Sharma is likely to miss his third game in a row when Mumbai Indians face Royal Challengers Bangalore in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday with both teams aiming to secure their spot in the IPL play-offs.

While Mumbai are sitting on top of the table despite their eight-wicket hammering by Rajasthan Royals with 14 points, Virat Kohli-led RCB too remain on 14 following their loss to Chennai Super Kings on Sunday.

A win for either side on Wednesday should be enough to take it to the play-offs.

Rohit’s fitness has become a subject of unwanted attention ahead of the game. Having missed the last two games due to a hamstring injury, Mumbai Indians skipper returned to the nets on Monday, a day when he was not named in the India squad for the Australia series.

There is still no conclusive update on his fitness from either Mumbai Indians or the BCCI.

In Rohit’s absence, Mumbai would persist with both Saurabh Tiwary and Ishan Kishan, who has played some scintillating knocks.

Quinton De Kock (374 runs) had a rare failure against Rajasthan and he would be keen to make an impact. Kishan (298 runs) and Suryakumar Yadav (283 runs) are among the leading run-scores who can go on the offensive against any attack.

The six-hitting prowess of Hardik Pandya (224 runs) was on display in the RR game, when he plundered seven maximums.

Along with stand-in captain Kieron Pollard (214 runs) and Krunal Pandya (85 runs), he can take any attack to cleansers and their hard-hitting ability could prove to be the difference between the two sides.

Mumbai bowlers would be more than keen to forget the hammering they received from Rajasthan’s Ben Stokes and Sanju Samson.

Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah have been lethal both at front and at the death, accounting for 33 wickets amongst themselves. For the third pacer spot, MI could choose between James Pattinson and Nathan Coulter Nile.

For RCB, Kohli (415 runs) would like to continue his splendid run in the tournament. Australian Aaron Finch (236 runs), young Devdutt Padikkal (343 runs) and AB de Villiers (324 runs) need to be more consistent and support their skipper.

De Villiers has shown time and again, why he is regarded as one of the best T20 batsmen by turning the clock back on few occasions. If the RCB top-order fires in unison, then they can pummel the MI attack into submission.

The likes of Chris Morris, Moeen Ali and Gurkeerat Mann, who form the lower-middle order, can also chip in with useful cameos.

But for the southern team there is injury scare on the bowling front with pacer Navdeep Saini suffering a split webbing. There is no clarity on his participation for the game against Mumbai.

In case he misses, Chris Morris and Mohammad Siraj would need to shoulder greater responsibility along with Isuru Udana.

Mumbai Indians: Rohit Sharma, Aditya Tare, Anmolpreet Singh, Anukul Roy, Chris Lynn, Dhawal Kulkarni, Digvijay Deshmukh, Hardik Pandya, Ishan Kishan, James Pattison, Jasprit Bumrah, Jayant Yadav, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Mitchell McClenaghan, Mohsin Khan, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Prince Balwant Rai, Quinton De Kock, Rahul Chahar, Saurabh Tiwary, Sherfane Rutherford, Suryakumar Yadav, Trent Boult.

244,2020/10/27,"I’ve battled depression and continue to struggle with it, says Mitchell Johnson","“I’ve found it tougher since retiring from cricket. All of a sudden, you’re not doing as much. You sort of lose your purpose a little bit,” he added

Former Australia pacer Mitchell Johnson has opened up on his battle with depression, saying he continues to struggle with his mental health even after retiring from all forms of cricket in 2018.

“Through my cricket career I actually just dealt with it (depression), it’s just about me now actually moving forward and taking it upon myself to be active with certain things, to keep my mind going,” Johnson said in Channel 7’s SAS Australia.

“I’ve found it tougher since retiring from cricket. All of a sudden, you’re not doing as much. You sort of lose your purpose a little bit,” he added.

Johnson, who took 313 wickets from 73 Tests, retired from Test cricket in 2015 but continued to play for three more years in the IPL and Big Bash.

“I struggle with, probably, confidence at times. I’m in that transition now where I’ve been out of playing cricket for about two years,” the 38-year-old said.

Asked if he had found retirement hard, Johnson replied: “Yeah plenty of times. I found out I’ve got depression but I think the depression was something I’ve had even from a younger age.

“It (cricket) sort of blocked things out in a way. It sort of hid the depression, but there was a lot of times where you would go back to your room, you’re away from family and you start to dwell on things.”

Johnson feels a cricketer’s lifestyle is at times responsible for such a condition.

“You have your moments where you struggle with it really bad and it can be tricky when you’ve got a lot of time to think about things,” he said.

“You’ve just got no control whatsoever and your mind starts playing those tricks on you, you start thinking of the worst,” the left-arm pacer added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/63s38/article24733719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th20-ckt-johnsoG6H4I6I0E3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ive-battled-depression-and-continue-to-struggle-with-it-mitchell-johnson/article32952060.ece
245,2020/10/27,Gavaskar seeks clarity regarding Rohit Sharma’s fitness status,"The Mumbai Indians skipper was left out of the team for the Australia tour after suffering a harmstring injury in the game against KXIP on October 18.

Former India skipper Sunil Gavaskar has called for more transparency on the status of limited-overs’ vice-captain Rohit Sharma’s hamstring injury after he was seen practising at the Mumbai Indians’ nets within hours of being left out of the squad for an upcoming tour of Australia.

The BCCI did not throw much light on Rohit Sharma’s fitness and just stated that it is monitoring his progress while announcing the three teams for the Australia tour on Monday. On the same day, Rohit Sharma was seen practicing at the Mumbai Indians nets.

“We are talking about the Test matches, which are a month and a half way. What actually is the problem with him will help everybody. And if he is practising in the nets for Mumbai Indians, then honestly I don’t know what kind of injury it is,” Gavasakar told IPL broadcaster Star Sports after the game between Kings XI Punjab and Kolkata Knight Riders in Sharjah on Monday.

“I think a little bit of transparency, a little bit of openness about what actually is the problem with him will help everybody,” he added.

The tour of Australia comprises three T20 Internationals, as many ODIs and four Tests. The series is scheduled to start on November 27.

Opener Mayank Agarwal, who too has missed out on the last two games for KXIP due to injury, was named in the Indian contingent for the tour.

“The Indian cricket fan deserves to know, more than anything else. The franchisees, I understand. They don’t want to give their hand away. They don’t want to give the oppositions any psychological advantage. But we are talking about the Indian team here. Even Mayank Agarwal for example. For an Indian cricket fan, they ought to know what happens to two of their key players, Gavaskar said.

Rohit Sharma may not be in the India squad but there is a possibility that he will return to lead Mumbai Indians later in the IPL.

Ahead of the CSK game on October 23, Mumbai Indians had said that Rohit Sharma had suffered a hamstring injury in the game against KXIP on October 18.

“Rohit Sharma has suffered left leg hamstring strain during Mumbai Indians’ last outing. He has made good progress over last four days, while the management is taking one day at a time monitoring the recovery process in consultancy with BCCI,” the statement had read.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/8rdb1m/article30309156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15-LEAD-IND-WG7V6RMQJ53jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/gavaskar-seeks-better-transparency-regarding-rohit-sharmas-fitness-status/article32951500.ece
246,2020/10/27,"Du Plessis, Russell and Miller pull out of Lankan Premier League","While the South African players are unavailable because of the limited-overs series against England, West Indian Russell has pulled out due to a knee injury

The inaugural Lankan Premier League (LPL) have been dealt a severe blow with five overseas players, including Faf du Plessis, Andre Russell and David Miller, pulling out of the T20 tournament less than a week after they were drafted into various franchises.

While South African trio of Miller, du Plessis and Dawid Malan are unavailable because of the limited-overs series against England, West Indian Russell has pulled out due to a knee injury.

Indian wicket-keeper batsman Manvinder Bisla, who played 35 IPL matches, is the fifth player to withdraw from the tournament, scheduled to be held from November 21 to December 13.

“The franchises that had these players will have to negotiate with other players to take their place,” LPL director Ravin Wickramaratne told ESPNcricinfo.

Russell, Miller, du Plessis and Malan all had been picked up as marquee players. While these withdrawals are a significant blow to the tournament, they are not a death knell just yet.

The hardest hit franchise is the Colombo Kings, who had all three of Russell, du Plessis and Bisla on its roster. The Jaffna Stallions had Malan.

The five-team tournament is scheduled to be held at two venues — Pallekele International Cricket Stadium in Kandy and Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium in Hambantota.

247,2020/10/27,Indian Premier League 2020 | Way Mandeep played made everyone emotional: KL Rahul,"Mandeep lost his father a couple of days back and he attended his funeral through video call.

Kings Xi Punjab KL Rahul was all praise for his teammate Mandeep Singh, who battled personal grief to play a match-winning knock of unbeaten 66 against Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL on Monday.

Mandeep lost his father a couple of days back and he attended his funeral through video call.

“With the bubble, you don’t have your closed ones. The way he (Mandeep) played, it makes everyone emotional,” said Rahul, terming it as “complete team performance”.

With M Ashwin and Ravi Bishnoi, the two wrist spinners bowling well in tandem, Rahul said the credit goes to head coach Anil Kumble.

“When you have Anil Kumble as the coach, it’s not surprising that we have two leg-spinners. Complete team effort, a lot of credit has to go to the coaches.”

KKR skipper Eoin Morgan said that he was disappointed that there wasn’t too many partnerships during their innings save the one between him and Shubman Gill.

“Disappointed with the partnerships, thought we could have scored more (runs). When we were three down, we wanted a partnership going,” Morgan said.

“Around 180-190 would have been a good score, but we kept losing wickets.

The Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) on Tuesday unveiled Sector 50 Metro Station as a ‘Pride Station’ and dedicated it to the transgender community.

Six members of the community have been recruited by the NMRC, undergone training and will work at the Sector 50 station.

Sensitised staffers

NMRC said that it has worked closely with NGO Nazariya to get a better understanding of the community’s concerns. The NGO also conducted workshops for NMRC staffers to sensitise them about transgenders.

In a statement, NMRC said that the station has been named “pride” as it feels extremely proud and privileged to have qualified members of the transgender community as part of the NMRC family.

Breaking stereotypes

“It instils a sense of pride among the community and this step by the NMRC is bound to be a ray of hope for the upliftment of the members of this community and help in breaking stereotypes about them so that they too can live a dignified life with their head held high,” the NMRC said.

The public transporter had come out with six vacancies — four for ticket vending operators and two for housekeeping staffers of the transgenders — specifically for deployment at the ‘Pride Station’.

254,2020/10/27,Khan Market gets its ‘resident musician’ back,"Anshu Sinha, stuck at home in Bihar during the lockdown, says the music scene has changed

“I had to announce to the world that I am back in town… it is almost like starting over,” said Anshu Sinha, a 23-year-old singer performing in the open spaces of Khan Market.

Mr. Anshu had gone back to his hometown in Bihar before the lockdown but returned to his haunt in early October. “As fate would have it, I had gone back home before the lockdown and then got stuck there. I returned in October first week and realised the music scene has changed. Now, I am back on the Khan Market street to tell everyone that I am back in business,” he said.

Anshu is from Barh, a town in Patna district, where his father Pramod Kumar Sinha had a major influence on him.

Anshu’s grandfather was also a musician.“It’s probably in the DNA,” he said.

An ache, however, remains that his father couldn’t get a stage to display his talent or an opportunity to refine his skills. “My grandfather played harmonium and banjo. My father sings very well but he remained a bathroom singer. Unfortunately, he never got the opportunity to hone his skill. He is otherwise a teacher at a private school and has a law degree,” he said, adding that his mother Madhuri also teaches at a private school.

College days

For Anshu, music and singing only began in college at Jamia Millia Islamia where he was pursuing a diploma in computer engineering in 2014. The first two years, he said, went by quickly but in the third year, ""I started singing in the canteen and a crowd would gather, enjoying my song covers.""

“During one of those sessions, a friend said that I should also learn to play guitar. I started learning from a local school in LaxmiNagar,” he said.

In his fourth year of college, Anshu started playing in cafes of Hauz Khas village but it didn’t give him the kind of recognition he was looking for. Coming from a ‘small’ town has a huge bearing on decisions you make in life, he said.

“Things were not working out for me here. I was thinking what to do… should I get a ₹10,000-₹15,000 job or should I go back… but I didn’t want to go back to my small town empty handed… what would I tell my parents,” he said.

One day, while surfing the Internet, he stumbled on the concept of busking – street performance for gratuities popular across the world – and he decided to explore the streets of Delhi.

“I started with Connaught Place because that was where everyone in Delhi likes to hang out. I thought what better place than that, but the experience was bad. People there only came to pass time… they didn’t see me as an artiste… many just looked down upon me,” he recalled.

Anshu then decided to hit Khan Market. The crowd respected him and his art of singing. “My aim to go to Khan Market or CP wasn’t to make money. We were financially weak but were still managing. My aim was to get contacts… for people to know that I can sing. Khan Market gave me that opportunity” he said, adding that money, however, is an important factor.

Within a few months, he was being called for private gigs in cafes and clubs for live music and earned a “decent” name in the local singing circuit of the city.

In February, however, Anshu flew home to attend to a personal matter and had decided to return right after Holi. “I got comfortable back home and decided I’ll go in a few days but by March 20, lockdown was announced and I got stuck. I only returned this month,” he said.

For Anshu, who managed with his savings over the last eight months, returning has certainly helped but “it is slowly picking up” as he has started visiting the market every evening. I have been invited to seven events in the last 20 days, he said.

“Of course I am scared of health but the fear of losing it all and going back to my small town with nothing is even scarier”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/qipsb6/article32958213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28DEANSHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/khan-market-gets-its-resident-musician-back/article32958214.ece
255,2020/10/27,3 members of Neeraj Bawana gang arrested after gunfight,"The accused were involved in an extortion and firing case

The Delhi police on Tuesday said that three members of the Neeraj Bawana gang were arrested early on Tuesday after an exchange of fire in north-west Delhi’s Karala.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said that the accused have been identified as Manish Dabas (27), resident of Ladpur Village, Deepak alias Katia (26), resident of Sultanpur Dabas, and Prince Panchal (23), resident of Burari.

The police said that Manish and Deepak got bullet injuries but are stable. The three were involved in an extortion case and firing outside the house of a businessman in north-west Delhi’s Model Town.

Threats to businessman

The police said that the businessman received a threat call on October 2, wherein the caller said that he belongs to Neeraj Bawana gang and demanded ₹50 lakh.

On October 21, the complainant again received an extortion call and the caller threatened to kill him or his family members if he did not fulfil their demand.

On Saturday, they fired multiple rounds near his house, the police said.

During investigation, the police got a tip-off on Monday that three members of the gang will come near Karala village, Mr. Yadav said, adding that a trap was laid and the accused were arrested.

Exchange fire

256,2020/10/27,Big task ahead for DG (Prisons) as paroled inmates set to return,"This comes after HC decision to end blanket order extending bails during lockdown

With over 6,800 inmates, who were released on interim bail or parole, set to surrender again following a Delhi High Court’s decision last week, the total population of the prisons is likely to reach an unprecedented 22,000, which may become unmanageable owing to the present COVID-19 situation.

Director General (Prisons) Sandeep Goel has informed a high-powered committee (HPC) set up to look into decongesting jails pursuant to the COVID-19 outbreak, that till date only on one occasion the maximum population of Delhi prisons has touched 18,000.

The development came following an HC decision on October 23 to end its blanket order extending all interim stays and bails granted during the lockdown as the situation has improved.

Significant number

The DG (Prison) told the committee that at present, the total population of inmates inside the jails was around 15,800. He informed that owing to the High Court order, over 2,300 under trial prisoners (UTPs) or convicts will surrender by November 13, raising the population of inmates significantly.

Mr. Goel, further, said if another 3,337 UTPs and 1,182 convicts who have been granted ‘interim bail/emergency parole’ under different criteria laid down by the HPC, are asked to surrender during the same duration, then the total population of Delhi prison is likely to reach 22,000.

This, the DG (Prisons) said, would be “unprecedented and may become unmanageable, owing to the present situation and circumstances”.

Calls for extension

The HPC, headed by Justice Hima Kohli, taking note of the situation opined that interim bail granted to 3,337 UTPs under its criteria needs to be extended for a further period of 30 days.

The HPC said it would be “highly inconvenient” for the jail authorities to accommodate UTPs and convicts released on ‘interim bail/emergency parole’ under its criteria, alongside those who would be surrendering in terms of the High Court’s orders. The recommendations of the HPC will be forwarded to the High Court for necessary action. The committee also stressed that its earlier decision to relax the criteria for grant of interim bail to the UTPs were made to help decongestion and to avoid the spread of virus in the jails. “...While doing so, it was to be kept in mind that the benefit of interim bail granted in such circumstances, cannot be to the detriment of social order,” the committee said.

Since courts have resumed functioning through physical mode/videoconferencing mode, the committee has decided not to further relax the criteria for the purposes of recommending grant of interim bail to the UTPs.

Cases in prisons

Of the three active cases of COVID-19 among jail inmates, one is admitted in Lok Nayak Hospital, the other is recuperating in DDU Hospital. The third jail inmate is admitted in Maharaja Agarsen Hospital.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/p685b6/article32958198.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27DELPRIYAJAIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/big-task-ahead-for-dg-prisons-as-paroled-inmates-set-to-return/article32958199.ece
257,2020/10/27,Shameful that civic bodies not releasing doctors’ salaries: CM,"Kejriwal says Centre should give ₹12,000 crore to Delhi municipal corporations

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, launching an all-out attack on the BJP-run Municipal Corporations here on Tuesday stating that the protest by doctors due to non-payment of their salaries by the MCDs was “shameful.”

A day after the Mayors of the three MCDs staged a protest demanding dues to the tune of Rs. 13,000 crores outside his residence, Mr. Kejriwal said that the Central government should grant funds to the MCDs so that the salaries of the doctors and other unpaid staff can be released.

According to Delhi government sources, an amount of Rs. 1965.91 crores was due to the MCDs between April 1 and October 26 of which Rs. 1752.61 crores had already been paid and the remainder had already been disbursed and was in the process of being credited to the civic bodies as per Urban Development department records.

""The MCD doctors are on strike due to non-payment of salaries for many months now. This is utterly shameful. The doctors who risked their lives to protect, treat, and serve us and our families, this is not right. This is a very sensitive matter, and there should be no politics on the issue,” he said.

“The MCD owes us Rs. 3800 crores which were given in the form of loans by the Delhi government. They also owe Rs. 3000 crores as bills to the Delhi Jal Board. The Central government gives grants to all municipal corporations across the country, based on Rs 485 per person. However, the central government is not paying grants to the three MCDs for the last few years,” he also said.

According to Mr. Kejriwal, since the population of Delhi is 2.25 crore the per year calculation comes to Rs. 1100-1200 crores according to Rs. 485 per person which amounts to Rs 12000 crores for 10 years. The Central government, he said, should be giving Rs. 12,000 crores to the MCDs; how else will they function, he asked.

The budget for the MCD, he said, was Rs. 12,000 crores of which the budget for salaries is Rs. 6000 crores. If the MCDs get these funds, why can't they pay salaries to their staff, he demanded. Currently, he said, the Delhi government was also suffering from an economic loss because of the Coronavirus pandemic and no tax collection. He said,

259,2020/10/27,Marginal improvement in Delhi’s AQI as wind speed picks up,"An improvement in local wind speed will counter the effect.

Pollution levels reduced marginally in the national capital on Tuesday morning but the air quality was still recorded in the very poor category.

A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department said the air quality index (AQI) is likely to improve with the wind speed picking up.

Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed help in their dispersion.

The city recorded an AQI of 335 at 10 a.m.. The 24-hour average AQI was 353 on Monday. It was 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday.

An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’,201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’

According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, the wind direction and speed were favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring regions.

It, however, said an improvement in local wind speed will counter the effect.

The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was 16% on Monday. It was 19% on Sunday and 9% on Saturday.

Cluster of fires

NASA’s satellite imagery also showed a very dense cluster of fires in Punjab, Haryana and nearby regions.

According to the Punjab Pollution Control Board, the State has recorded 14,461 incidents of stubble burning between September 21 and October 25 as compared to 9,796 during the corresponding period last year.

Haryana has recorded around 4,284 incidents of stubble burning this season so far.

The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said Delhi’s air quality was likely to remain very poor till October 31.

The air quality warning system said the ventilation index — a product of mixing depth and average wind speed — was expected to be around 11,500 metre square per second on Tuesday — favourable for dispersion of pollutants.

Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.

A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.

Severe air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.

The Centre had on Monday told the Supreme Court that it will bring a legislation to curb air pollution in the Delhi-NCR.

According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most — 18 to 39% — to Delhi’s air pollution.

Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38%), followed by industries (2 to 29%), thermal power plants (3 to 11%) and construction (8%).",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/dlmz2k/article32919691.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16-KDR-SC-stuG9V7S8V8V3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/marginal-improvement-in-delhis-aqi-as-wind-speed-picks-up/article32950997.ece
260,2020/10/27,Hindu Rao crisis a sign of systemic failure: IMA,"It demands North civic body immediately pay pending salaries of doctors

The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Monday said that it “takes serious exception to the unfortunate situation in Hindu Rao Hospital, which is under the management of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation”.

Highlighting the issue of non-payment of salaries to the municipal doctors for several months, the association said the situation pointed towards systemic failure. “Doctors who have served the nation during the pandemic deserve appropriate accolades and incentives. It defies logic when they have to resort to roadside agitations to get their salaries. Retreat of the political class from governance across India seems to be a byproduct of the pandemic,” the IMA said in a statement.

All the three municipal corporations in Delhi are controlled by the BJP.

“The Supreme Court had directed that salaries of healthcare workers should be paid in time. The IMA demands that the authorities should pay the salaries of the doctors along with the dues immediately,” said the IMA.

Meanwhile, senior doctors of North Corporation-run hospitals went on a day-long casual leave en masse on Monday as the crisis over pending salaries deepened with no resolution in sight.

R.R Gautam, president of the Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association (MCDA) said, “If our demands are not met, we will go on indefinite strike from Tuesday.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hindu-rao-crisis-a-sign-of-systemic-failure-ima/article32947994.ece
261,2020/10/27,Mayors sit on dharna outside CM residence,"They seek dues worth ₹13,000 crore

The Mayors of the three BJP-ruled Municipal Corporations sat on a dharna outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s official residence on Monday demanding financial dues to the tune of thousands of crores.

North Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Jai Prakash, South Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Anamika Mithilesh Singh and East Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Nirmal Jain demanded that the Delhi government release ₹13,000 crore to the civic bodies.

The alleged fund crunch is understood to have affected an estimated two lakh municipal employees, including doctors, nurses and sanitation workers.

The three Mayors said they had reached Mr. Kejriwal’s official residence at 6, Flagstaff Road, in the morning to meet him but were not allowed to enter the premises. They remained outside his residence till 8 p.m., following which Health Minister Satyendar Jain met them and, according to the BJP, assured them that the needful would be done.

“I told the three Mayors that the Centre is supposed to give ₹12,000 crore to the civic bodies. The Centre is supposed to give ₹488 per individual as grant to civic bodies but they have not paid for years. The Delhi government also has outstanding loan of ₹6000 crore on the municipalities and if there is any due on us we will repay them,” Mr. Jain said, adding that he had received instructions from Mr. Kejriwal to meet the Mayors at 2 p.m. but the BJP leaders did not turn up.

He accused the Mayors of politicking over the issue instead of seeking to solve it. “If they were facing trouble in running civic bodies, they could have asked the Centre for help,” Mr. Jain said, adding: “We have given an open invitation to hand over the civic bodies to us.”

Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the Mayors will seek a meeting with the CM again on Tuesday and added that the funds were being deliberately stalled by the Delhi government.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/mayors-sit-on-dharna-outside-cm-residence/article32947989.ece
262,2020/10/27,Family of ASI denied ex gratia,"He worked in Crime Branch, passed away in May after testing positive for COVID

The family of a 53-year-old Delhi Police Assistant Sub Inspector has been denied ex-gratia of ₹1 crore by the Delhi government.

ASI Shesh Mani Pandey was posted in Crime Branch’s fingerprint bureau and passed away on May 30 after testing positive for COVID-19 on May 26.

In a letter dated October 7, accessed by The Hindu, it is stated that the case had been examined and “is not found covered under the Cabinet Decision No. 2835 dated 13.05.2020, as the deceased was performing his routine duty assigned to him and was not deployed for COVID-19 duty which is a mandatory condition to become eligible for grant of ex-gratia of ₹1 crore”.

Mr. Pandey’s case filed had been processed in April.

His son Krishna Kumar Pandey said that the family was shocked to hear about the denial on Saturday.

“We were informed by Delhi Police that our file has been rejected. We were shocked because we were heavily dependent on this money. Also, we were always assured by authorities that we would get this money,” he said.

“How can they say he was not on COVID-19 duty? He was a policeman… employees in rest of the country were asked to work from home but people in the force did not have that option. My father caught the virus after visiting a murder spot in Nabi Karim and the deceased was COVID-19 positive,” Krishna said, adding that he had asked his father to take leave from work.

“He said he would not be able to get leave. But added that he was in a government job and if something happened to him, the government would take care... though none of us had thought that anything will happen,” he added.

Commissioner of Police S.N. Shrivastava, after Mr. Pandey’s demise, had tweeted: “Delhi Police family mourns the loss of 2 brave police officers in our fight against Corona pandemic despite best efforts to save them. We pay homage to ASIs Vikram and Shesh Mani Pandey and may their souls rest in peace. We are committed to providing all help to their families [sic].”

Mr. Pandey was an ex-serviceman who retired as Naik Subedar in 2012 and joined Delhi Police in 2015. He was from Madhya Pradesh’s Rewa, and is survived by his wife and two sons. “My brother is pursuing engineering in Delhi. I, along with my mother, wife, son and grandparents live in Rewa.

267,2020/10/27,Travel agency director fined ₹10.80 lakh for sexual harassment of employee,"Panel ordered his immediate removal, told to tender unconditional apology

Holding the director of a travel agency here guilty of sexually harassing a woman employee at the workplace, the Local Committee (Gurugram) has directed the accused to pay ₹10.8 lakh to the complainant as one-time compensation and tender an unconditional apology. It also ordered his immediate removal from his current role.

Fine on start-up too

The committee also imposed ₹50,000 fine on the agency for failing to provide a safe environment to the employees.

Set up under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, the Local Committee, also known as Local Complaints Committee, has the mandate to hear cases for companies without Internal Complaint Committees or in case the accused is a director/CEO of the firm.

Passing the directions, the committee said the award was based on a similar judgment in the case of IP Infusion Software India Private Limited, Bengaluru on December 27, 2016 and meant to serve as reminder and deterrent to the accused to refrain from such actions in the future.

The 27-year-old complainant had accused the company’s director Amit Rai Malhotra, 45, of sexually harassing her on several occasions between September 2019 and January 21, 2020.

She said she brought up the matter with her supervisor, department head, and even the Chief Executive Officer, but to no avail.

The committee in its judgment relied on the consistency in the complainant’s narration of events, supporting evidence in the form of WhatsApp messages sent by her to the supervisor showing that she had experienced discomfort and the testimonies of two eyewitnesses.

Bid to delay case

In a 27-page-order, the three-member committee chaired by Rshmi Khetrapal also observed that attempts to drag the case by filing complaints with the National Commission for Women, police and the committee itself with allegations and counter allegations of influencing witnesses and tampering with the evidence were clearly aimed at delaying the case and tiring the victim.

The respondents in the case alleged that the complainant had conspired with her two colleagues since they were terminated and levelled false charges. But the committee dismissed the conspiracy theory saying the complainant came from a conservative family and was not likely to risk her reputation for her colleagues.

The committee also noted that none of the defence witnesses stated anything untoward regarding her character or performance at work. In her complaint, she never raised any demand for financial compensation or to reinstate her colleagues, the order said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/travel-agency-director-fined-1080-lakh-for-sexual-harassment-of-employee/article32947899.ece

269,2020/10/27,Govt. officials meet to discuss EV charging stations,"List of locations where stations would come up expected in the coming weeks

The second meeting of the working group on accelerated rollout of charging infrastructure in Delhi was held here on Monday to discuss the status of identification of potential land sites owned by government departments and agencies for setting up electric vehicle charging infrastructure in Delhi.

Senior officials from the Transport Department, Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System Limited (DIMTS) and Delhi Transco Limited (DTL) attended the meeting.

Faster uptake

During the meeting, the government said in a statement, emphasis was laid on building an effective EV infrastructure across the city for faster uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) and the final list of locations where charging stations would come up was expected over the coming weeks.

The first meeting to this end was held on September 17 where the members had agreed that Delhi Transco Limited (DTL) as the State Nodal Agency for EVs, will pool government land parcels and integrate a State-wise tender to instal charging stations across Delhi.

Land parcels

Simultaneously, DTL and Delhi discoms will also conduct a joint survey of the land parcels to identify sites for Priority 1 of the tendering process.

The Delhi EV policy, 2020, targets 25% of all new vehicle registrations by 2024 to be battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In order to encourage the rapid adoption of electric vehicles, the government is focusing on the speedy rollout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure in Delhi.

For installation of EV charging stations, a centralised tendering system will be adopted to hire an energy operator to run, maintain and upgrade charging stations.

270,2020/10/27,E-boarding for international air passengers,"Service available for select flights of IndiGo airlines

GMR’s Rajiv Gandhi International International Airport (RGIA), which had earlier launched paperless e-boarding facility for domestic passengers, has now rolled out a similar indigenously developed digital solution for international passengers, becoming the first airport in India to do so.

In line with the Government of India’s ‘Digital India’ campaign, the service is currently available for select international flights of IndiGo airlines following a successful pilot project. IndiGo became the maiden carrier to commence this facility when their Sharjah-bound passengers e-boarded themselves from Hyderabad (6E 1405 flight) on October 2.

Other scheduled international carriers operating out of Hyderabad are in the process of integration with the airport’s e-boarding system, which will be rolled out soon, an official spokesman informed.

The procedure

Passengers are free to choose between using conventional paper boarding passes or electronic boarding passes on their mobile phones to use the system. Those opting for e-boarding can book the ticket online and do a web check-in. Once the passenger reaches the airport, the digital/printed boarding card should be displayed at the e-boarding scanner; the CISF personnel then validates the documents and allows entry.

At the check-in counter, the agent scans the boarding card/s when passengers drop off luggage at the counter. Passengers then complete passport verification by officials of the Bureau of Immigration, the hand baggage is put on automatic tray retrieval system and follows the security check. The boarding card is scanned on an e-boarding scanner. The boarding card is once again scanned on an e-boarding scanner before the passenger moves towards the gates for boarding the aircraft.

All international departures passengers are being processed from the Interim International Departures Terminal (IIDT).

Airport CEO Pradeep Panicker pointed out that the e-boarding facility for domestic passengers was being run successfully for the last five years after its introduction in December 2015 and the process was automated for international passengers enhances safety and security during the present COVID-19 pandemic scenario.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/e-boarding-for-international-air-passengers/article32957697.ece
271,2020/10/27,Keeping a hawk’s eye on Shukoorsagar dam embankment,"Police personnel guarding area since a week to prevent flood-affected residents from pumping water out of the lake

The embankment of Shukoorsagar dam has become a high security no-go zone in the aftermath of flooding in Osman Nagar, Shaheen Nagar, Sufa Colony and other areas. A posse of policemen from Balapur Police Station, mobile surveillance cameras and floodlights have been deployed in the area to restrict access. Only the residents of Venkatapur are being allowed to cross the dam bund to reach their homes.

“Hundreds of houses are under water in the other part of the lake. We are guarding this place for the past one week to prevent anyone from trying to release water from the lake,” said a police official. Before the lake got filled up, the embankment and the Katta Maisamma temple had untrammelled access.

The fear is not unfounded as the residents whose houses are under water have been demanding release of the water or pumping it out. “A government which can bring down a massive building like the secretariat can easily pump out water from this lake,” said Muhammad Ahmed of Sufa Colony who is now staying at a relative’s house in Yakutpura. “They should drain the water. How long can we live on charity of others,” asked his wife as they waited to collect relief material being distributed in the area. According to residents of the area, the water level is still rising due to seepage and release of drain water from other areas into the lake.

Below the dam is the village of Venkatapur and further downstream are Babanagar and many other areas which have already borne the brunt of flash floods. “Water from that dam has never overflowed. The farmers here use it for irrigation by pumping it,” said Satish who lives in the Venkatapur village where the paddy fields are making way for apartments. One of the unfinished apartments has ankle-deep water while the surrounding areas have knee-high water.

Mass Foundation, an NGO working in the area, has applied to the Commissioner of Jalpally to allow usage of pumps to drain the water from the lake. “The main problem of the people here is that they have lost everything. But if the water is drained, at least they will have a roof over their heads,” said Mazher Ahmed of the NGO.

“We have failed at the policy level to bring relief to the people there by not draining the water. Irrigation experts can easily come up with a solution that is pragmatic and would not cause harm to the surrounding areas. We require governmental intervention to solve this problem rather an individual solution,” said Anant Maringanti of Hyderabad Urban Labs.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/dvuszb/article32957659.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY27-STANDALONE-PAGE2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/keeping-a-hawks-eye-on-shukoorsagar-dam-embankment/article32957648.ece

A total of 14,621 people in and around flooded localities of Hyderabad have been detected with fever. The cases were detected at outreach health camps organised by the Health department from October 15 to 26 after heavy rains flooded several parts of the State capital, especially Old City.

Sewage water with silt inundated streets and gushed into homes too, forcing people to wade through the muck to reach safer places.

3,113 people with rashes

Medical staff posted at the health camps also found that 3,113 people developed rashes while 39,109 had common cold. There were 1,62,405 miscellaneous cases. Each health camp had a doctor, two staff nurses and a supporting staff. People from 2,843 vulnerable localities were covered.

Hyderabad’s District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) J. Venkati said house-to-house surveys were also carried out by Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) and Auxiliary Nursing Midwives (ANM) in which the affected people were asked about the source of water and food they were consuming. Contaminated water often leads to typhoid, jaundice, diarrhoea, and other infections.

On a case to case basis, ASHA and ANMs, passed information to departments concerned in case clean water was needed at a particular home. “They also enquired if anyone has diabetes, hypertension, or other diseases. We supplied medicines to those in need,” Dr Venkati said. Patients with life-threatening diseases such as cancer or those in need of dialysis were shifted to government hospitals.

While tests to detect coronavirus were conducted at the relief camps, response to it dropped as people went back home or found accommodation elsewhere.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/deluge-leaves-behind-a-trail-of-infections/article32957602.ece

278,2020/10/27,Police rein in BJP leaders prompting them to approach EC,"Senior party members decry 'high-handedness’ and excessive use of force by police.

BJP’s top brass, including city president and MLC N. Ramchander Rao, were put under house arrest while other senior leaders were detained at police station as police tried to thwart the party's efforts to take up protests against the police raids on Dubbaka candidate M. Raghunandan Rao's house on Tuesday.

While party president Bandi Sanjay Kumar continued his fast at his house at Karimnagar, party leader G. Manohar Reddy was arrested at the Saidabad police station. Police personnel also surrounded Nizamabad MP D. Aravind’s house to prevent him from coming out.

A delegation of the party leadership including N. Indrasena Reddy is scheduled to meet the Chief Electoral Officer later in the day and lodge an official complaint against the police. Siddipet district collector Venkatrami Reddy has already been shifted following charges of ""misuse"" of official machinery and Mancherial collector Bharati Hollekeri given his charges.

Senior leaders like national BC morcha president K. Laxman, former MP Vivek Venkataswamy, D.K. Aruna, Babu Mohan and others strongly criticised the police action against the party leaders. It only reflected the Government's fear of losing the byelection, they observed.

Chief spokesperson Krishnasagaar Rao has denounced the ""highhanded behaviour"" of the police towards Mr. Sanjay Kumar and others. ""If the police had any grounds for his arrest, they could have very well done it without using force. The videos on social media clearly show excessive force used by police"", he said.

Mr. Rao asked if the police were acting independently or with the permission of the Election Commission.

279,2020/10/27,Hyderabad airport extends e-boarding platform for international passengers,"GMR led Hyderabad International Airport which had earlier launched the paperless e-boarding to all its domestic passengers across all flights has now rolled out an indigenously developed similar digital solution for international flights, becoming the first airport in India to do so, on Tuesday.

The service is currently available for select international flights of IndiGo Airlines following a rigorous and successful pilot project. IndiGo Airlines became the maiden carrier to commence this facility when their Sharjah-bound passengers e-boarded themselves from Hyderabad on the 6E 1405 flight on Oct.2. Other scheduled international carriers operating out of Hyderabad are in the process of integration with the airport’s e-boarding system, which will be rolled out soon, an official spokesman informed.

Passengers are free to choose between using conventional paper boarding passes or electronic boarding passes on their mobile phones to use the system. Those opting for the e-boarding can book the ticket online and do a web check-in. Once the passenger reaches the airport, the digital/printed boarding card should be displayed at the e-boarding scanner; the CISF personnel then validates the documents and allows passenger entry.

At the check in counter, the agent scans the boarding card/s when passengers can drop luggage at the counter. Passengers then complete passport verification by officials of the Bureau of Immigration, the hand baggage is put on automatic tray retrieval system and follows the security check. The boarding card is scanned on an e-boarding scanner. The boarding card is once again scanned on an e-boarding scanner before the passenger moves towards the gates for boarding the aircraft.

All international departures passengers are being processed from the Interim International Departures Terminal (IIDT). Special screening and safety measures are in place during the flight’s handling to protect against the COVID-19, which includes thermal screening prior to terminal entry, mandatory social distancing enforced through special queuing arrangements at all passenger processing points, he said in a press release.

Airport CEO Pradeep Panicker pointed out that the e-boarding for domestic passengers was being run successfully for the last five years after introduction in Dec.2015 and automating the process for international passengers too enhances the safety and security during the present pandemic scenario. “We are confident of getting all our international carriers operating from Hyderabad onto our e-boarding platform,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hyderabad-airport-extends-e-boarding-platform-for-international-passengers/article32952977.ece
280,2020/10/27,Abhay Jodhpurkar: Melodies have a long shelf life,"At ease with both film and independent music, Abhay Jodhpurkar talks about collaborating with composer Jeet Gannguli for ‘Ae Mere Dil’

‘Ae mere dil’, an independent music video with the song composed by Jeet Gannguli and sung by Abhay Jodhpurkar, crossed a million views on YouTube within a few hours of its launch last week. The music video, produced by VYRL Originals, features Shaheer Sheikh and Tejasswi Prakash and is the first collaboration between Abhay and Jeet.

Abhay had sung a Tamil version of the composer’s popular Hindi track ‘Muskurane ki wajah’ from the film City Lights, which had caught the latter’s attention: “He liked my rendition and much later, I got to work with him for ‘Ae Mere Dil’,” says Abhay.

The love ballad addresses relationship turmoil and Abhay says he was moved to tears by Manoj Muntashir’s lyrics: “It’s beautifully written and brought back memories. Anyone who has been through heartbreaks will relate to this song which spells hope.”

Romantic melodies have become Abhay’s forte, since ‘Moongil Thottam’ from Kadal (Tamil). There were other groovy, foot-tapping hits like ‘Helana…’ (Iru Mugan, Tamil), but romantic melodies became his trump card. There was ‘Itu itu…’ (Kanche, Telugu) and later his first Hindi film soundtrack ‘Mera naam tu’ (Zero): “Melodies have a long shelf life and I am happy I got to sing these songs. I am sensitive by nature and can cry at the drop of a hat; I am happy to have been typecast in this segment, though I have tried out various songs. In fact, I remember AR Rahman mentioning in an interview that there was something spiritual about my voice. I take it as a huge compliment,” says Abhay.

On his YouTube channel, one can listen to his cover versions of all-time hits ‘Lag jaa gale’, ‘Yeh haseen vadiyan’ and a medley tribute to Mohammed Rafi: “I love the golden age of Hindi film music and the cover versions are my tribute to the legends. When I choose a song for cover rendition, I don’t think of how many views it will get; I select songs that I love listening to.”

Stepping out of his comfort zone, he also tried an acapella rendition of ‘Cherathukal’ from Kumbalangi Nights (Malayalam), accompanied by Keshav Ram. “I loved ‘Cherathukal’ and have heard it repeatedly. We had fun working on the acapella version,” he says.

Those who have followed Abhay’s musical journey might be aware that the Indore-born singer pursued Engineering in Chennai, learnt music at KM Music Conservatory and is a protégée of AR Rahman. The college years in Chennai helped him learn to speak in Tamil, and he got familiar with Telugu and Kannada during his initial years as a singer.

He admits that Malayalam was tougher. He remembers recording one song for three days, struggling to learn the pronunciation, when he first recorded a Malayalam song.

A familiar voice in South Indian languages, Zero gave him a break in Hindi film music. Simultaneously, Abhay has been exploring the independent music space. He acknowledges the resurgence in independent music and says, “It’s a good time for original music; the OTT space is opening up and there’s a lot of scope to look beyond the norm.”

Reverting to talk about ‘Ae Mere Dil’, Abhay says the collaboration with the composer, lyricist and the creative team happened over Zoom meetings: “It was rejuvenating to share ideas; music kept us going during the lockdown. The virtual collaboration was rather smooth.”

Next, he looks forward to the Tamil version of A R Rahman’s 99 Songs for which he has sung, and has a few other projects lined up.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/3honwp/article32953519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Abhay-Jodhpurkar-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/abhay-jodhpurkar-on-collaborating-with-jeet-gannguli-for-ae-mere-dil/article32953520.ece

A community skill park, opened as part of a government effort to create additional skill acquisition, was inaugurated at the Kinfra Park at Kalamassery on Tuesday by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

The government’s Additional Skill Acquisition Programme (ASAP) has been trying to train skilled youth from Kerala through practical training in communication, IT, and and other areas to equip the youth further and enhance their employability.

The community skill park in Kalamassery will be a place for industrialists and workers to come together in such a way that the employers and employees will meet the skills that are needed to help each other.

The State government has planned 17 such skill parks. A total of nine skill parks have so far become operational and others will be launched soon.

Artificial intelligence, machine learning, business analytics, data science, cyber security, block chain management, and Internet of Things are some of the courses being opened at the skill park.

The additional skill acquisition parks are envisioned as advanced development hubs to meet international standards.

282,2020/10/27,Flow of ganja to district rising steadily,"After a brief lull following the lockdown in the last week of March, the flow of ganja to the district seems to be steadily on the rise over the past couple of months.

In the past eight-month period since the clamping and the lifting of the lockdown, September has accounted for the most number of cases under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act at 33 and seizure of the maximum volume of ganja of 37.56 kg during a single month in the Ernakulam excise division. Notwithstanding the restrictions on arrests, 46 persons were detained during the month.

So far this month, 8.73 kg of ganja has been seized and 14 persons have been arrested under 28 NDPS cases. The arrest of a teenager with 2.25 kg of ganja from Thripunithura on Monday was the latest seizure.

In March, 3.77 kg of ganja was seized, which dropped to 0.26 kg in April at the height of the lockdown. It surged to 21.39 kg May before dropping to 2.15 kg in June, 0.15 kg in July and 0.53 kg in August. In total, 74.56 kg of ganja was seized and 57 ganja plants were uprooted during the March-October period.

“Due to the severe restrictions of COVID-19 protocol, enforcement is now mostly restricted to specific tip-offs, leaving traffickers with a congenial atmosphere for smuggling in ganja. For every seizure we make, many more consignments may be entering the district undetected,” said T.A. Ashok Kumar, Deputy Excise Commissioner, Ernakulam.

Hiding the contraband in cargo vehicles from neighbouring States, mainly from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, remains one of common modus operandi now to smuggle in ganja in the knowledge that not all vehicles would be checked in the prevailing situation.

“It is common for youngsters from here to go to Cumbum or Theni in Tamil Nadu or Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh to take delivery of ganja. There is a significant drop in the prices of ganja in those States considering that supply exceeds demand and that smuggling to faraway places like Mumbai is not possible now,” said Mr. Kumar. “This means that the carriers who manage to get the consignment into the district undetected can make a huge profit,” said Mr. Kumar.

The excise department had recently formed a six-member special squad led by an excise inspector to stem the influx of ganja into the district.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/flow-of-ganja-to-district-rising-steadily/article32957418.ece
283,2020/10/27,Police out to crack puzzle over ganja hoard,"13 kg of narcotic in two lots was found abandoned in Kunnathunadu

The Kunnathunadu police have launched a probe into the mysterious incident in which 13 kg of ganja was found abandoned within its limits on the intervening night of Sunday.

The contraband was recovered in two lots containing 2 kg and 11 kg from two separate locations.

The first package along the Pattimattom-Kizhakkamabalam road was found by a youngster who mistook it for a courier packet that had accidentally fallen off a vehicle and brought it to the police. It turned out to be a tightly packed consignment of ganja measuring 2 kg.

No sooner was it found than a few more packets containing 11 kg of ganja were recovered from a rubber plantation not far away. A tapping worker had found the suspicious packages when he turned up for work in the morning hours on Monday. He promptly alerted the plantation owner, who in turn, informed the police.

On opening it at the station, the police found ganja in five tightly sealed packets covered with brown paper. “All the packages were similarly packed, giving the impression that perhaps they were part of the same consignment,” said V.T. Shajan, Station House Officer, Kunnathunadu.

The police have started collecting CCTV footage from the locality for clues. Efforts are on to collect the call data record of mobile phones, which were active in the nearest tower locations during the hours immediately before and after the packages were recovered.

Ganja trade has been common in Kunnathunadu limits with a large migrant population, though things were quiet during the lockdown and the months immediately after that.

“Our primary hunch is that the carriers might have spotted our night patrolling team engaged in vehicle checking and panicked. So, they probably abandoned it in the hope of recovering it later,” said Mr. Shajan.

The police have registered two cases under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act in this connection.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/police-out-to-crack-puzzle-over-ganja-hoard/article32957380.ece

289,2020/10/27,Decision to allow boats from Other States welcomed,"‘Thoppumpady harbour can now operate at full capacity’

The decision by the Ernakulam district administration to allow fishing boats from other States to use harbours in the district amid strict curbs has come as a great relief for fishing operators in major harbours like Thoppumpady.

The fishing harbour, which has been seriously affected by the ban on operations by other-State fishers, would now be able to operate at full capacity, said M. Majeed of the Fisheries Harbour Coordination Committee on Monday.

The decision by the district authorities brings to an end the confusion created by the ban. The ban had prevented long and tuna liners from using the Thoppumpady harbour, the biggest harbour in Kerala, over the past one month. Mr. Majeed said that there were around 650 longliners and gillnet boats that were the mainstay of the harbour.

He also said that about 5,000 people worked at the harbour and the harbour was the nerve centre of activities for supply of raw materials for processing units in Edakochi and Alappuzha’s northern towns like Eramalloor and Aroor.

The arrival of a fleet of longliners and gillnet boats early in October had triggered a stand-off between purse seine boat operators, who refused to allow their catch to be unloaded and auctioned off at the harbour. In protest, harbour workers had said that they would not work for purse seine boat operators. The stand-off between the groups had brought the operations of the fishing harbour to a halt for more than a fortnight.

Mr. Majeed said that the government decision to impose a strict watch over the operations was welcome as the fishing industry as a whole wanted to cause no disruption in the COVID-19 containment activities.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/decision-to-allow-boats-from-other-states-welcomed/article32956561.ece

291,2020/10/27,"Social media producing biases, says Romila Thapar","Historians urged to defend ideas based on reliable evidence

Noted historian Romila Thapar has said that historians should be ready to debate and defend their ideas on the basis of reliable evidence.

“We should not dismiss a bias but try and understand why there is a bias. Every human being has a bias and its conditioned by the context in which you grow up and think or what you read and these days by the new invention that you call social media, which produces all kinds of biases,” she said at a webinar on ‘Meet the Historian’ organised by the Kerala History Congress on Tuesday.

“The main thing then is looking for a range of sources and defending what one picks up and how one interprets its sources does require very wide reading. A historian today has to read books in other disciplines in order to understand what some historians are writing,” she said.

Theoretical knowledge

On whether her writings were too theoretical, Ms. Thapar responded by referring to it as a comment on the decline of emphasis on intellectual work in what we today call education. “The content of education today does not encourage people to think analytically. I think that is really a big crisis not to people like myself. But for the younger generation that is growing up and seeking education. Education does not mean its only for jobs. It should also make you think. Theoretical knowledge may be a problem for wider public for whom history is a narrative of events,” she said.

Continuity and change

Ms. Thapar pointed out that historians had to recognise that there was something in the past that continued in a different form into the present. “We as historians have to recognise both the continuity and the change. A historian is like a detective that searches for clues. You are asking a question of what happened and you are searching for clues. We have to understand what happened in the past in order to understand something that is happening in the present,” she said.

Rajan Gurukkal, president of Kerala History Congress, said that similar sessions would be held with renowned historians aimed at understanding their methodology and methods of historical research.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/social-media-producing-biases-says-romila-thapar/article32956156.ece
292,2020/10/27,SmartCity Kochi refutes allegation over termination of tenancy,"Alleges misinformation campaign by a few tenants

SmartCity Kochi has shot down allegation that it has terminated 12 companies operating out of it as baseless and attributed it to an alleged misinformation campaign by a couple of its tenants.

In a release issued here, SmartCity Kochi said that it had not initiated any eviction process but had only issued demand notices to six of its tenants for pending dues. Lease termination notices had been served to three tenants for continued breach of agreements, it said.

The clarification was issued in the wake of a news channel report in which the chief executive of a company alleged that his company was terminated by SmartCity Kochi. “We refute such false information and confirm that the company so represented on the television news has not been served any demand/termination notice since it is no more a defaulting tenant. The reasons for an unconnected person from a tenant organisation to represent as a ‘terminated tenant’ in the media is only to tarnish the image of SmartCity Kochi before the general public for reasons best known to him,” stated SmartCity Kochi.

It further stated that one of the tenants even resorted to verbal and written abuse demeaning the officers of SmartCity Kochi, which were on record and the matter was currently before the law enforcement authorities. The tenants needed to honour the tenancy agreements and law, it said.

The company further reiterated that it being not a Government IT Park, the government’s order dated April 27 granting rent waiver and payment deferment to IT/ ITeS companies operating out of such parks was not applicable to it.

Out of the 37 current tenants, 28 had chosen to honour the tenancy agreement with a few accepting SmartCity Kochi’s offer for deferred payment of rentals, which was offered early in April. The terminated tenants were defaulters and failed to make timely payments of dues in spite of numerous opportunities provided to them. “However, SmartCity Kochi will not forcefully evict them from the premises since it is against SmartCity Kochi’s culture and ethos. If they clear their dues, they will be reinstated as tenants,” the release said.

Seven tenants had approached SmartCity Kochi for amicable settlement of unpaid rent, and some of them had even started to settle their dues, in the wake of a High Court direction in this connection, the release said. As directed, SmartCity Kochi would either adjust the unpaid rent dues from the security deposit or would accept dues from the tenants, as the case may be.

“The matter is now restricted to only four tenants and they have full clarity on the matter by way of court and government orders and should settle the dues and fulfil their obligations as per the tenancy agreements,” said SmartCity Kochi.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/smartcity-kochi-refutes-allegations/article32955914.ece
293,2020/10/27,"COVID-19 cases in Ernakulam dip, with fall in testing","457 new cases and 1,096 recoveries take active caseload to 11,771

The number of new COVID-19 cases in Ernakulam dipped to 457 on Monday, accompanied by a fall in testing.

A total of 3,780 samples were sent for testing from government and private facilities. The number of tests has fallen from 5,377 samples on Sunday and over 7,000 samples each on Friday and Saturday.

While 337 people have contracted the infection through local contact, the source of infection of 111 persons could not be traced. Eight health workers have newly been infected. Positive cases were reported from areas including Nayarambalam, Thripunithura, Thrikkakara, Vazhakulam, Fort Kochi, Kaloor, Kadungaloor and Kalamassery.

With 1,096 recoveries, the district’s active caseload stands at 11,771.

At the Government Medical College Hospital, 199 patients are being treated. As many as 47 patients are at PVS Hospital, and 682 patients are at private hospitals.

294,2020/10/27,Growing number of active COVID-19 cases poses threat to surveillance system in Ernakulam district,"Tracing all contacts of patients and alerting them no longer practical in district

Systems that were in place in the district to trace contacts of COVID-19 patients and enforce quarantine are beginning to crumble beneath the weight of a growing number of active cases.

Ward-level rapid response teams were formed to handle COVID-related exigencies earlier. The teams, comprising the local ASHA worker, Kudumbashree and anganwadi workers, local health officials and the councillor or panchayat member, were still keeping track of people in quarantine in the district, said Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission. But it was no longer practical to trace and track all contacts and enter their details into the system. “We are relying on people being aware themselves,” said Dr. Numpeli.

A junior health inspector in Kadungalloor said secondary contacts were no longer being traced. “Primary contacts in the family or workspace are alerted and then asked to inform people they came in contact with,” he said. A junior health inspector in Eloor also said that if there were 18 to 20 positive cases in a single division in a day, it was no longer possible to identify and alert all contacts.

While the ward-level response teams would meet regularly earlier, those meetings rarely happen at present, said P.M. Harris, councillor representing Kaloor. Besides, some of the community-level health workers also ended up in quarantine routinely, making such meetings nearly impossible, he added.

A senior police officer who asked not to be named said the services of the police in the contact tracing process were currently marshalled only in some cases where the source of infection was unknown and a patient’s memory jogged using call records retrieved by the police. “With law and order problems, there is little time to trace contacts or enforce quarantine as we did earlier,” he said. The Ernakulam Rural Police had introduced an app, Happy@Home, in April to enforce quarantine norms. But, the app was barely in use any more and enforcing quarantine even among primary and secondary contacts was proving to be difficult considering the number of active cases in the district, he added.

A doctor part of the District Surveillance Unit for COVID-19, who also asked not to be named, said some of health workers at the field level were engaged in entering data onto three different software portals – the State government’s Healthmon and COVID Jagratha, and the district administration’s Coronasafe Network – and at least five spreadsheets that collated information from the local level on testing and details of patients. Besides tracing contacts and symptom surveillance, health workers in some places where data entry operators had not been appointed, also had to enter large volumes of data, he said. The system hinged on such data being made available on time even from private labs, to avoid a situation where the control room was not immediately aware of patients who tested positive and asked to be shifted, he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/growing-number-of-active-covid-19-cases-poses-threat-to-surveillance-system-in-ernakulam-district/article32948448.ece
295,2020/10/27,"Ahead of elections, Kochi Corporation tries to revive bottled water project","Of the three plants set up four years ago, only the one at Fort Kochi is still running

With the term of the current Kochi Corporation council set to end in a few weeks, the civic administration is attempting to revive a bottled drinking water supply project that did not take off despite an ambitious launch in 2016.

Of the three plants that were set up four years ago, one each at Ravipuram, Edappally and Fort Kochi Veli, only the one in Fort Kochi is still running.

The Ravipuram plant is likely to begin operations soon, according to local councillor David Parambithara. “The project is to be handled by Kudumbashree groups. Though some groups had expressed willingness to take up the supply at Ravipuram, they eventually backed out. After years of trying to get a group to take it up, five members have come forward to run the plant,” he said. The place was cleaned and the water recently sent for testing, he added.

The plant was set up at a cost of ₹25 lakh in association with the Kerala State Women’s Development Corporation, and had been lying defunct for the most part of the past four years.

While the project initially involved selling a 20-litre can of water for ₹20, that amount might not be feasible any more considering the amount it could cost to supply the water, said Mr. Parambithara.

The plant at Fort Kochi, which is being operated by three Kudumbashree members, had hiked the rate of the can from ₹20 to ₹30 to meet the expenses of handling logistics. The Kudumbashree group had purchased a goods autorickshaw to supply the cans and had to pay off the loan taken for the vehicle, said Sheeba Lal, councillor representing Fort Kochi Veli. The COVID-19 cases in several places in West Kochi had briefly hit their supply when they would not be allowed to cross the barriers of containment zones, but till then, it had been running fairly well with a supply of 200 to 300 cans daily, she said. The plant was still operating much below its capacity, but lifting, loading, transporting and delivering the cans was a time-consuming process for just three people.

Soumya Sunil, who is part of the three-member team running the project in Fort Kochi, said the COVID-19 restrictions had hit them hard. The closure of banks, schools and homestays meant that business had dipped. The cost of hiring another vehicle and driver for supply, besides having to pay off the loan on their autorickshaw, had been eating into the little revenue they were making, she said. While they began as a five-member team, two women dropped out when they found it difficult to bear the weight of the 20-litre cans.

Of the ₹30 from each can, ₹10 would go towards the operations of the plant, ₹10 would be paid to hire the second vehicle, and only ₹10 was left to for the three of them together, she said. The cost and the prospect of paying off a loan could be keeping other groups away from running the other two plants, she added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ahead-of-elections-kochi-corporation-tries-to-revive-bottled-water-project/article32948433.ece
296,2020/10/27,Man held on charge of theft,"Nearly two years after he allegedly cheated a courier company of gold ornaments worth ₹6 lakh in 10 bogus transactions, the Aluva East police arrested the accused from Kundara in Kollam on Monday.

The arrested was identified as Sandeep, 31, of Azhikode in Kannur district. The accused had allegedly cheated the courier company based at Thayikkattukara in Aluva where he was temporarily employed from February to March 2019.

The police said the accused had resorted to a rather novel method to pull off the act without immediate detection. He used to place orders for gold ornaments to fake addresses using the cash-on-delivery option through his courier company.

Later, when he was entrusted with the parcels for delivery, he allegedly took the articles and returned the parcels in sealed condition claiming that the buyer was away. The cheating was exposed when the Bengaluru-based company found out that the valuables were missing when they scanned the returned parcels. Following this, they lodged a police complaint. The accused had been absconding since then.

“The accused has revealed the places where he had sold the ornaments. Now, we will have to take them to those places for recovery after securing his custody,” said Rajesh P.S., Station House Officer, Aluva.

The police have registered a case invoking Section 381 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/man-held-on-charge-of-theft/article32948428.ece
297,2020/10/27,"From their homes, children enter the world of letters","Temples forced to scale down Vidyarambham rituals

Sitting on her mother’s lap, two-and-a-half-year-old Dhara Sadhvi was initiated into the world of letters at their apartment in Kaloor on the occasion of Vijayadashami on Monday.

In the company of her parents and grandparents, the child wrote her first letters on a platter of rice without raising any objections. “We had promised to initiate her into the world of knowledge at a temple in Thrissur as an offering. However, we dropped the plan considering the restrictions in place in view of the pandemic. We consulted the temple and followed all the rituals,” said Meenu Nidhun, the child’s mother.

A majority of parents followed the same path as most places of worship did away with the customary Vidyarambham rituals in the wake of COVID-19 spread.

Technology-driven events were also held in compliance with physical distancing norms. Sukrutham, an Ernakulam-based organisation, joined hands with Bhagavatham Village in Chalakudy to introduce children to the world of letters through an online meeting.

“Around 20 children participated in the hour-long event in which Swami Udit Chaithanya played the role of guru. Parents had arranged everything associated with the event at their homes and wrote the first letters on their wards’ tongues using gold rings immersed in honey. Without hot and humid conditions and with no strangers around, it proved to be a smooth initiation for the children,” said Sunil Illam, vice president of Sukrutham.

The famed Dakshina Mookambika Temple at North Paravur, usually thronged by thousands of devotees on Vijayadashami day, had a scaled-down ceremony to mark the occasion. From the regular list of gurus, the temple only roped in those aged below 65 years this time.

“We strictly followed the COVID-19 protocol and did not let devotees into the nalambalam, with the event restricted to the makeshift pandal outside. Not more than 600 children took part in a function that lasted over six hours from 5 a.m.,” said P.D. Pushpalatha, a temple office bearer.

The Chottanikkara Bhagavathy Temple did away with all Vidyarambham ceremonies. “It was a big loss both for us and the devotees, many of whom were saddened by the decision to cancel the event. There was no other alternative since we could not have controlled the event,” said an office bearer.

The Ernakulam Siva Temple had no official event, though some parents chose to conduct the ceremony at the temple’s Saraswathy Mandapam. “Only a percussion performance by child artistes was held to mark the occasion,” said Rajendraprasad T., president of the temple committee.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/njk62/article32948414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26KI-VIJAYADASHMI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/from-their-homes-children-enter-the-world-of-letters/article32948415.ece

A low-key immersion of idols on Monday marked the end of week-long Durga Puja festival in West Bengal that was held amidst the COVID-19 pandemic under extreme caution. No immersion procession was allowed at the ghats and only one or two members of the Durga Puja committee was allowed to go to the river.

Elaborate arrangements were made at the 21 ghats in the city, where hundreds of idols were immersed in the river Hooghly. Chairman of Board of Administrators of Kolkata Municipal Corporation Firhad Hakim said the civic body was following the restrictions both due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the order of the National Green Tribunal on immersion of idols.

Cranes were used at major ghats to extricate the immersed idols. The State Transport Department has commissioned a jetty so that people can watch the immersion from the river. There was low-key immersion in the other rivers and water bodies of the State, including Ichamati, where people on both banks — India and Bangladesh — come in boats to witness the immersion.

Mr. Hakim said that most of the immersions in the city would be over by Tuesday and only a few big-ticket Pujas would be left. The size of Durga idols were smaller this year and environmentalist say that it is good news for the river as the pollution will be under control.

The festival saw few people on the streets in Kolkata and other towns as the Calcutta High Court had ordered that all Puja pandals would be no entry zones.

299,2020/10/27,‘The Almirah’ - a fashion project by Kerala artist-entrepreneur that looks at limited spaces for women as a fallout of the pandemic,"This fashion project looks at limited spaces and opportunities available to women as a fallout of pandemic-led restrictions

In Sharmila Nair’s multidisciplinary installation, The Almirah, a woman says joyfully, “Tenth day of the lockdown and you are beside me…while another voices her anguish, “When was the last time we shared the sinking emptiness...”

The fashion project looks at the limited spaces available to women as a fallout of pandemic-led restrictions. “After the lockdown was announced, I stood in front of my almirah looking at my stock of saris, which would go unsold and unseen for a long time, and I began to wonder about the privations of women across the world,” says the artist-cum-entrepreneur, who in 2019 came up with 18 Shades of Black, in which a black sari symbolised the restrictions faced by women in daily life.

The almirah also forms a part of a woman’s trousseau in some communities of Kerala and Sharmila uses it as a metaphor to interpret different aspects of feminism. “For a bride, the almirah, which she gets as a gift, is perhaps the only personal space that connects her to her family. It is a link,” says Sharmila, who keeps her stock in an ancient, century-old cupboard that once belonged to her grandmother.

Being stuck within the four walls of the home can affect women in many ways. Sharmila’s friend’s grandmother fell into depression and had to be hospitalised because her only outing to a place of worship had ceased. However, there are others who see the lockdown as a boon because they have been able to spend quality time with their families.

Combining these ideas, Sharmila had a six-by-four foot almirah constructed in the basement of a building and, together with Bharatanatyam dancer Ramya Suvi and filmmaker-cinematographer Ratheesh Ravindran, created a telling narrative of women confined to a space.

Dressed in saris from the almirah, Ramya performed within the tight, ‘unshelved’, closed space expressing diverse emotions ranging from the agony of entrapment to a sense of security.

The installation combines art fashion, photography, performance and poetry. Ratheesh who wrote the poetry says, “We started the campaign with happiness, as many women felt happy with extended time on their hands. But it soon changed to fear, frustration, anger and sadness. We tried to capture all these nuances.” Lighting the cupboard space, he says, was a challenge because of the reflective glass.

Sharmila also hopes to start a campaign titled Open the Almirah. “Through Open the Almirah we aim to inspire corporates to take this up as a CSR project where they can put across the idea of donating one valuable thing inside the almirah, for those in need. The valuables may be anything, ranging from clothing to basic essentials,” she says

Currently The Almirah, which was released on social media on October 10, can be viewed on the FB page and Instagram handle of Red Lotus. There are plans to showcase it in gallery space post pandemic.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/8wj1zm/article32951624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpalmirah1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/a-fashion-installation-looks-at-feminism-and-the-pandemic/article32951627.ece

Improved safety arrangements are in place at the Armed Reserve Camp of the Kozhikode Rural police at Keezhariyur where 48 SARS-CoV-2 cases have been confirmed by the Health Department. Though the number of active cases is only five now, many personnel are in room quarantine.

The total strength of the camp is 360 apart from the Anti-Naxal Squad members, which prompts the authorities to go for stringent safety measures. Office rooms of senior officials have been rearranged to ensure a safe working environment. A convenient shift arrangement has been introduced to ensure physical distancing.

‘Allegations baseless’

An official from the camp said some of the recent allegations against them that they were not complying with the health protocol were baseless. He pointed out that policemen on duty would not be able to move around wearing personal protective gear like a medical professional considering the very nature of the job.

The official claimed that RT-PCR tests had been conducted in the camp following their own demand. “We will be able to ensure our safety only if there are no law-and-order issues. These days, a number of quirky protests are taking place and we have to tackle them as part of our duty,” he said.

Officials from the camp also pointed out that there were many police stations in the city and rural areas where a large number of policemen contracted the virus while performing their duty. The Payyoli police station was one of the recent examples, they said.

A functionary of the Kerala Police Association said their members were going through a risky situation as the number of positive cases among them was found increasing. “On Friday, eight policemen, including a Circle Inspector and a Sub Inspector, tested positive at Elathur station. They all contracted the virus while performing duty,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/safety-measures-stepped-up-at-ar-camp/article32957497.ece

BJP councillors of the Kozhikode Corporation began a seven-day satyagraha in protest against the alleged corruption and misgovernance in the civic body in front of the corporation office on Tuesday.

Inaugurating the protest, BJP State general secretary M.T. Ramesh accused the ruling CPI(M) of utter failure to undertake development programmes in the city. Corruption had been rampant in all spheres of activity.

Crores of rupees were swindled off in the name of various projects, he alleged.

Mr. Ramesh said that the activities of the civic body during the past five years should be subjected to auditing.

Incidentally, he also alleged that the Congress party, which was in the opposition, was hand-in-glove with the CPI(M) in all such deals. These parties should clarify whether they gave priority to the welfare of the citizens or the interests of wealthy capitalists, the BJP leader said.

BJP councillors Nambadi Narayanan, N. Satheesh Kumar, E. Prasanth Kumar, Navya Haridas, Ponnathu Shyma, and Jisha Gireesh are staging the protest for a week.

306,2020/10/27,Work on Kerala’s first waste-to-energy plant begins at Njeliyanparamba in Kozhikode,"₹250-crore project coming up on 12.67 acres of Kozhikode Corporation land

Work on the first waste-to-energy plant in the State began at Njeliyanparamba in Kozhikode on Monday with a bhoomi pooja. Mayor Thottathil Raveendran and Kozhikode Corporation’s standing committee chairpersons took part in the event, which marked the first step towards the construction of the plant, expected to begin in January 2021.

The waste-to-energy plant is being set up on 12.67 acres of Corporation land by a Bengaluru-based consortium led by Zonta Infratech Private Limited. The ₹250-crore project is expected to process around 450 tonnes of solid waste and create 6 MW of electricity per day.

The plant will benefit Ramanattukara, Feroke and Koyilandy municipalities, and Olavanna, Kunnamangalam and Kadalundi panchayats besides the Kozhikode Corporation.

The Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) is the nodal agency for the project and a special purpose vehicle named Malabar Waste Management Private Limited has been formed to carry out the project.

The local bodies are expected to pay a tipping fees to the company and also take responsibility for waste collection in their jurisdiction. The waste collected will be segregated and taken to the plant by the company from designated collection points.

Crimes against women, especially Dalit women, had risen under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, said All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Sanjay Dutt here on Tuesday.

He was addressing the mediapersons on the sidelines of the preparatory meeting with AICC cadre for the 2021 Assembly elections. Mr. Dutt said that the downtrodden and the women were the worst-affected under the BJP government.

The enactment of farm Acts was against the interests of the farmers. “Although the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister identifies himself as a farmer, he failed to raise objections to the the Bills that were against the interests of the farmers,” he added.

The Union government did not understand the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic and failed to take measures to contain its spread, said Mr. Dutt. “Although former Congress president Rahul Gandhi suggested some steps that the government must take to contain the pandemic to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Union government failed to act upon them,” he said.

The BJP government was against the interests of the people of Tamil Nadu, he added.

Earlier, Mr. Dutt started a signature campaign in Madurai against the passage of the farm Acts. Party’s Madurai district president V.

The three-member team including Dr. T Sabeetha from the Directorate of Medical Education, Radhakrishnan, nodal officer from National Medical Council of India visited the new buildings under construction. The Dean Alli accompanied them.

In a brief chat with reporters, Dr Sabeetha said that despite the pandemic, the work was progressing at a fast pace. ‘I am hopeful that the building would come up as we have nine more months as per the schedule,’ she said.

The State government obtained permission to start 11 new medical colleges across different districts in Tamil Nadu a few months ago. The Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had laid the foundation stone for the building here along with Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan.

Even as the building work commenced, the pandemic halted the pace as restrictions were imposed.

However, after a gap of nearly 120 days, the works have resumed and going on in full-swing, the team members said.

The government would soon apply for NOC and once the buildings were completed, a high-level team would inspect the buildings and accord approval for admission.

310,2020/10/27,Farmers and villagers stage road roko,"They demand release of water into the Kudaganaru

Demanding release of water for irrigation and drinking purpose, thousands of farmers and villagers including women and children resorted to road roko along the Dindigul-Batlagundu road here on Tuesday.

A large posse of police personnel led by DIG of Police (Dindigul Range) M S Muthusami and Superintendent of Police Ravali Priya chased away agitators and arrested 286 people.

The protesters raised slogans and refused to give way for motorists. Because, a large number of habitations including Mallayapuram, Veerakal, Anumantharayan Kottai, Paarati, Ponmaanthurai did not get water from the river for almost eight years. Water from the Kamarajar dam had been flowing into the Kudaganaru from time immemorial. The water used to flow into the Cauvery near Karur district after flowing for about 110 km covering several habitations on the way. But the flow of water into the Kudaganaru stopped eight years ago when a check dam was constructed at Raja Vaaikaal.

‘We used to get water for at least six months in a year,’ Karuppiah, a farmer from Ponmanthurai, told reporters and added that a series of agitations over the last three years including non-participation in the local body polls did not fetch any result. When the villagers resorted to agitations last month continuously, officials released water in the Kudaganaru for about 10 days but suddenly suspended it without any reason, another farmer, Vincent Arockiam, said. So, they decided to resort to wait-in protest until officials conceded their demand. The police, who were taken aback after seeing a large turnout, ensured that more personnel were deployed. When the agitators were told that the revenue and PWD officials would hold a joint meeting with all representatives, they refused to agree to the initiative. So, the police decided to arrest the villagers. As many of them dispersed, they arrested 286 people and released them later in the evening.

The police said that they would register cases against the villagers for violating the Disaster Management Act, among others. Meanwhile, the villagers accused the officials of misleading them and threatened to boycott the ensuing Assembly polls if water was not released in Kudaganaru soon.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/water/article32958090.ece

The LUB must work towards implementing various schemes of the Central government for the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), said M. Ramalingam, General Manager, District Industries Centre. “Many industries in the district will fall under the micro enterprises category, following the change in definition of MSMEs. So, LUB must work with these industries towards their upliftment,” he said.

Mr. Ramalingam said ₹372. 4 crore had been sanctioned for 11,338 MSMEs in the district under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme.

The member-secretary of Centre for Entrepreneurship Development R. Jayaraman said LUB must empower, enrich and train more young entrepreneurs.

K. Subramanian, zonal manager of Indian Bank, said LUB must work for industrial development in all the 13 blocks in the district.

313,2020/10/27,Coastal marine aquarium complex proposed on Karnataka coastline,"To showcase the flora and the fauna of the Western Ghats and the aquatic biodiversity, the College of Fisheries, Mangaluru, has proposed setting up a coastal marine museum complex along the 320-km coastline of the state.

Modelled on a proposed museum district ‘Panchjanya’ in New Delhi, the college has proposed setting up the marine museum complex at an elevated place on the coastline. A part of this complex will extend to the sea and give people a real feel of the aquatic life, said A. Senthil Vel, Dean.

“This complex will not only showcase the rich biodiversity and culture of the Western Ghats, but also give a good understanding of the aquatic life,” said Prof. Vel, who, incidentally, was involved in conceptualising the proposed Panchjanya Aquarium Complex.

Ideally the marine complex should be at a place where water is not polluted. This place should also connected to different parts of the State and to Goa, he said.

Prof. Vel made this proposal during a meeting chaired by Minister for Fisheries, Inland Transport department and Muzarai, Kota Srinivas Poojary, at the college on Tuesday.

Prof. Vel said the complex can be set up in about 10 acres. One among the 25 of the 120 islands along the Karnataka coast, which are 5 metres above sea level, can also be considered for this complex.

These 25 islands are ideal for integrated tourism development projects, he added.

The construction of the museum complex can be taken up either under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada scheme or any other scheme of the State government.

The museum complexes are allowed under the Coastal Regulatory Zone norms.

Mr. Poojary asked Prof. Vel to sit with officials of the Fisheries Department and select three ideal places in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Uttara Kannada districts where this complex can be built.

Palakkad Railway Division under the Southern Railway and Mysuru Division under the South Western Railway that have jurisdiction over railway network in Dakshina Knnada got new heads on Tuesday.

Trilok Kothari, an officer of the Indian Railway Service of Stores took over as DRM of Palakkad Division from Pratap Singh Shami, who has been transferred and posted to the North Central Railway, said a release from Palakkad Division.

Prior to this assignment, Mr. Kothari was the Chief Materials Manager, Head Quarters, Diesel Locomotive Works, Varanasi. He had worked as Additional DRM, Nagpur Division, in the Central Railway. He has also worked in the Railway Board as Director looking after Procurement Policies. Besides these assignments, he has worked in Rail Coach Factory, Kapurthala, Northern Railway, and North Central Railway in various capacities.

Belonging to the 1989 batch of IRSS, Mr. Kothari joined Indian Railways in 1991 after completing B.Tech and M.Tech from IIT Delhi.

At Mysuru, Rahul Agarwal took charge as the new DRM from outgoing DRM Aparna Garg, who is now posted as the Principal Financial Advisor, Rail Wheel Factory, Bengaluru.

315,2020/10/27,College of Fisheries in city seeks university tag,"College of Fisheries, Mangaluru, that celebrated the golden jubilee of its inception last year, has urged the State government to declare it as a university so as to take the State to new heights in the fisheries sector thereby generating considerable revenue. College Dean A. Senthil Vel made this proposal at a review meeting chaired by Minister for Ports and Fisheries Kota Srinivas Poojari here on Monday. “The demand is not just for the growth of the institution but also for the overall growth of the fisheries sector in the State,” he said, assuring the government of the larger entity taking the State to the top position in terms of revenues from the fisheries sector.

The college that was with the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, was brought under the Karnataka Veterinary, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Sciences University, Bidar, in 2005. “Consequently, fisheries has remained isolated and is neither getting attention nor funds,” Prof. Vel said, pointing out at resources on the 75-acres campus lying in disuse.

While the institution is the only fisheries college in the State, Prof. Vel said that Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andra Pradesh already have a fisheries university each. Maharashtra has four fisheries colleges, he said.

Professor in the Department of Aquatic Environment Management of the college A.T. Ramachandra Nayak said that the proposed university can run diploma and polytechnic courses too. Opening of Fish Information Centres of the university in different parts of the State will help in effectively reaching out to fishermen. New departments in climate change, remote sensing and artificial intelligence, fisheries business management and Pharmacology and Toxicology will go a long way in addressing emerging issues in the fisheries sector, he said.

Concurring with the demand, Mr. Poojari asked the college to place the proposal before the Secretary to the Fisheries Department. “Make it a point to explain how this university will make a difference in changing the fortune of the State in the fisheries sector,” he said and added, “I have all hopes that the proposal will be approved by the Cabinet.”

Mr. Poojari asked the institution to help the State government in strengthening the Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation. The institution should come up with effective means of dredging estuaries.

The additional outgo to combat the impact of COVID-19 will significantly erode the fiscal consolidation achieved by the State governments in the past three years, the RBI said in a report on Tuesday.

In its study of the State budgets of 2020-21,the RBI has dwelled on ‘COVID-19 and its Spatial Dimensions in India’ and said that Gross Fiscal Deficit (GFD) of the States would spiral during the current fiscal.

“States have budgeted their consolidated GFD at 2.8% of GDP in 2020-21; however, the COVID-19 pandemic may alter budget estimates significantly, eroding the gains of consolidation secured in the preceding three years — the average GFD for States that presented their budgets before the outbreak of COVID-19 is 2.4% of GSDP, while the average for budgets presented post-lockdown is 4.6%,” the RBI said.

Credibility at stake

Observing that the quality of spending and the credibility of State budgets will assume critical importance, it said, “The next few years are going to be challenging for the States. They have played an important role in the frontline of the defence against the pandemic. Going forward, they need to remain empowered to provide growth impulses to the Indian economy and build resilience against future pandemics as well.

“Sustaining the recovery from the pandemic will reshape State finances, entailing boosting investment in health care systems and other social safety nets in line with the States’ demographic and co-morbidity profiles,” it added.

States’ responses by delaying or cutting down expenditures, even wages and salaries, also need to be taken into account in the assessment of the pandemic’s effects on State finances.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/46d19u/article32957610.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THBURBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/covid-to-erode-3-years-of-fiscal-consolidation-gains-of-states-rbi/article32957611.ece

A resurgence in COVID-19 infections in Europe is a cause of worry for India’s engineering exporters; and could potentially impact their performance this fiscal as the European Union remains one of the top three markets for them, according to a leader of industry body EEPC India.

“The COVID-19 situation in Europe in the last 7-10 days is getting bad to worse; we are keeping fingers crossed. If we can reach our last year’s figures, we will happy about it,” former chairman of the engineering exporters body Rakesh Shah said on Tuesday.

“It is reviving and we are looking at a positive situation in times to come,” he said, adding that the engineering exports declineds 29.40% in theApril-June quarter and increased 3.17% in the July-September quarter. Overall in the first six months of the fiscal, the decline was 13.73%.

The EU is among the top three partners in India’s engineering trade constituting 17% of the exports. India’s engineering exports to the EU is about $14.24 billion. Though there was a drop in exports to the region in the COVID scenario, the market remains still promising, he said.

Along with other EEPC leaders, including chairman Mahesh Desai, Mr. Shah addressed the media virtually ahead of the inauguration of EEPC India’s 'India Subcontracting Expo 2020’ for overseas buyers.

It is the first virtual exhibition by EEPC India and is a four-day event. Nearly 100 engineering exporters are showcasing their products and technologies to major buyers from Europe, including the U.K., seeking to bag manufacturing contracts and thus give a boost to Make In India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat programmes.

In a statement, Ajit Mohan, vice president and managing director, Facebook India, said, “Ankhi has decided to step down from her role in Facebook to pursue her interest in public service.”

“Ankhi was one of our earliest employees in India and played an instrumental role in the growth of the company and its services over the last nine years. She has been a part of my leadership team over the last two years, a role in which she has made enormous contributions. We are grateful for her service and wish her the very best for the future,” he added.

The controversy over Facebook’s and Ms. Das’s role in not adequately controlling hate speech on the platform, and political bias in India, started over two months back, when a report published by The Wall Street Journal alleged that the company violated its own rules for hate speech to favour some individuals, including those associated with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), after Ms. Das’s intervention. The report had stated that, according to Ms. Das, punishing violations by politicians from the ruling party “would damage the company’s business prospects in the country”.

This was followed by another report by the paper stating that Ms. Das had over the past years shown support for the BJP via posts in a Facebook group for employees, while disparaging the Opposition parties. The report said that in one of the messages, posted the day before BJP won the 2014 national elections, Ms. Das wrote, “We lit a fire to his social media campaign and the rest is of course history.”

The Reserve Bank on Tuesday asked all lending institutions, including non-banking financial companies, to implement the waiver of interest on interest for loans up to ₹2 crore for the six months moratorium period beginning March 1, 2020.

On October 23, the government had announced the scheme for grant of ex-gratia payment of difference between compound interest and simple interest for six months to borrowers in specified loan accounts.

The scheme mandates ex-gratia payment to certain categories of borrowers by way of crediting the difference between simple interest and compound interest for the period between March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020 by respective lending institutions.

The government had asked the lending institutions to complete the exercise of crediting the amount in the accounts of borrowers by November 5.

“All lending institutions are advised to be guided by the provisions of the Scheme and take necessary action within the stipulated timeline,” the RBI said in a notification.

The Finance Ministry had issued the operational guidelines in the backdrop of the Supreme Court’s direction to implement the interest waiver scheme.

The apex court on October 14, directed the Centre to implement “as soon as possible” interest waiver on loans of up to ₹2 crore under the RBI moratorium scheme in view of the COVID-19 pandemic saying the common man’s Diwali is in the government’s hands.

Housing loans, education loans, credit card dues, auto loans, MSME loans, consumer durable loans and consumption loans are covered under the scheme.

As per the scheme, the lending institutions shall credit the difference between compound interest and simple interest with regard to the eligible borrowers in respective accounts for the said period irrespective of whether the borrower fully or partially availed the moratorium on repayment of loan announced by the RBI on March 27, 2020.

The scheme is also applicable on those who have not availed the moratorium scheme and continued with the repayment of loans.

The lending institutions after crediting the amount will claim the reimbursement from the central government.

India’s fight against COVID-19 is at a critical juncture. Against the backdrop of recent economic reforms by the government, and significant stimulus packages, recovery measures are poised to lift millions from this unprecedented economic and health crisis and tackle widening inequalities. The recovery is offering India two golden opportunities: one, to build climate resilience for the most vulnerable by ensuring that stimulus measures are green; and two, to meaningfully address long-standing gender equality issues.

The pandemic has exacted a heavy toll. Fragile health systems and frontline health workers are overburdened and lives and livelihoods impacted. The poor, Adivasis, migrants, informal workers, sexual minorities, people with disabilities and women all face a greater brunt than most. Beyond this, the causes and effects of climate change — stressed agriculture, food insecurity, unplanned urban growth, thinning forest covers, rising temperatures and shrinking water resources — have also hit vulnerable groups disproportionately.

Vulnerable group

Women in particular have their work cut out for them. Greater demands of unpaid care work during the pandemic and rising rates of reported violence are a stark reminder of the work that remains to be done. According to the India Voluntary National Review 2020, female labour force participation rate for the 15-59 age group is showing a declining trend and stands at 25.3%. This is one of the lowest rates in the world.

Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund estimates that equal participation of women in the workforce will increase India’s GDP by 27%.

The Indian government has invested nearly $22.5 billion in COVID-19 recovery. Strengthening social protection using targeted and appropriate fiscal and policy measures is a good start. Aligning these recovery packages with India’s commitments on climate change by investing in green jobs will improve lives and make our planet healthier. These green investments ought to be reflected across agriculture, urban planning, energy and the health sectors and in climate-resilient civil works, including under MGNREGA.

Women, particularly those from indigenous and marginalised communities, play a significant yet unsung role in various sectors. Comprising more than 50% of the agricultural labour force, and nearly 14% of all entrepreneurs, women’s relationship with the environment and the informal economy can be a useful lever of action to transform the lives and livelihoods of their families and communities.

Equipping women with skills

Disha, a UNDP initiative supported by the IKEA Foundation, has reached one million women and girls with skills and livelihood opportunities. This initiative has shown the benefits of investing in local jobs for women and vulnerable communities. These investments energise local economies, reduce carbon emissions, enhance climate resilience and disrupt social norms and behaviours that restrict women’s participation in the workforce. Another example comes from an initiative by the Self-Employed Women’s Association and the Electronics Sector Skills Council of India, and supported by the UN Environment Programme. By training young rural women to develop a cadre of 15,000 solar technicians for the maintenance of solar pumps in remote locations, the initiative will not only introduce clean energy options but also reduce production costs. Accelerating the transition to renewable energy will lower carbon footprints and can help provide sustainable livelihoods to poor women.

Creating the right financial incentives, fostering sustainable public-private partnerships and enabling women entrepreneurs to access markets, training and mentoring will be critical in scaling up these approaches. The Asian Development Bank projects that India’s GDP growth rate will rebound to 8% in 2021-22. Putting women at the heart of this recovery will make it faster, just and inclusive.

340,2020/10/27,The magic of mythmaking,"If we meekly allow advertisements to be withdrawn, we will foreclose for good the possibility of our cultural reinvention

Social historian Daniel Boorstin, writing in the 1960s, called advertising “the most characteristic and remunerative form of American literature”. Writing around the same time, Marshall McLuhan ranked advertising among the 20th century’s greatest art forms.

As it has played out, neither man was exaggerating. The ‘persuasion industry’ is well entrenched today, and it is hardly surprising that the 45-second commercial created by jewellery brand Tanishq should have taken up so much mindspace these past few weeks.

We are no strangers to religious controversy nor has fanaticism been the preserve of any one community. From the exile of M.F. Husain to the blacklisting of Taslima Nasreen to regular book burnings and film bans, the fanatics excel at outrage. But this time they outdid themselves. The ad that was viciously trolled showed a Muslim mother-in-law celebrating her Hindu daughter-in-law’s pregnancy with Hindu rituals. In other words, they were offended not by intolerance but by tolerance.

A tenuous argument

Besides the usual commentariat on either side of the debate, a third stream emerged asking if brands need ideology. This argument is tenuous. Through the 20th century, as advertising took upon itself the role of shaping the aspirations and desires of entire societies, its function expanded vastly beyond the mere selling of products to selling a way of life. The streaming images — beautiful woman, muscular man, uniformed chauffeur — point not just to a car but to mindsets and life choices that can make that car come true. That’s why Roland Barthes called advertising the supreme mythmaker of our age and ads the closest modern approximation to ancient myths. When Nike uses Serena Williams to relate the story of women in sports, it isn’t just selling sports shoes, it is selling the myth of women’s empowerment — the social condition that lets women play sports and buy sports shoes.

Also read: Viewer complains against Tanishq ad for ‘promoting communal intermingling’; ASCI junks it

By ‘selling’ at this subliminal level, advertising insinuates itself into everyday customs and practices, and becomes popular culture. It defines social constructs, such as ‘modernity’ or ‘success’ — ‘modern’ men load washing machines; ‘successful’ women use food delivery apps. And via these definitions, advertising is able to construct new social mores — where men aren’t ridiculed for washing clothes, nor women for not cooking. The motive might be commercial, but that advertising is constantly moulding and reflecting society is indubitable.

Creating desirable myths

Less than 3% of marriages in India are inter-religious, and this figure is unlikely to change dramatically anytime soon. A majority of Indians will continue to marry within their own religion and community, just as a majority of women will continue doing the household chores. But by depicting an inter-religious marriage, advertising creates a certain desirable myth — not of a society where such marriage is a norm but one that accepts it when it happens. When online portal ‘Myntra’ featured a lesbian couple in its 2015 ad, it essentially conjured up a society that accepts a non-heterosexual relationship. By placing them within conventional tropes of shopping, clothes and parents, it erased the taboos and ostracism such couples face in real life. It allowed them social sanction.

As society gets more secularised and modernised, we begin to seek our moral markers from places other than religion. Cultural studies scholar Judith Williamson said, “Advertising has a function which I believe in many ways replaces that traditionally fulfilled by art and religion — it creates meaning.” This meaning-making is not optional but intrinsic to advertising. The Amul girl doesn’t just innocently sell butter — she sells an image of the nation, reflected through sporting triumphs, national tragedies, election results or, increasingly, even Rafale plane deals. As we consume, we subconsciously also seek such reflections that let us reimagine ourselves and the world we inhabit through the lens of the ad.

Whether the Tanishq commercial or the Surf Excel ad last year that showed a Hindu girl protecting a Muslim boy from being splashed with Holi colours on his way to namaaz, both propose a myth of harmonious co-existence — of the kind an Amar Akbar Anthony created — which could well be self-fulfilling in the long run. (Just as men who load washing machines are no longer unicorns.) These myths reflect not just who we are but who we want to be. The trolls shut down these stories not because they are real but because they could become real. It might no longer be possible to eradicate trolls in this hyper-malevolent era, but we need to cling at least to our myths. If we meekly let these be destroyed and the dream factories shut down, we will foreclose for good the possibility of our cultural reinvention. And that will signal our final bankruptcy of imagination. Yet, it’s more clear than ever now that imagination, after all, is also a nation.

341,2020/10/27,The many lessons from COVID-19,"What we have done so far, and what all remains to be done

The global pandemic is marching on. As I had said at the JRD Tata Oration, hosted by the Population Foundation of India on its 50th anniversary, of the lessons I have learned over the last nine or 10 months, the most important one is the significance of investing in public health and primary healthcare. Countries that invested in primary healthcare over the past decade or two are reaping the benefits now. Another lesson is the positive role of science and scientists. The global collaboration between scientists to take forward advances in knowledge so that science is continuously informing our response to the pandemic has been encouraging.

Gendered impact

In India, the pandemic has had a differential impact on women. Despite gaps, India had seen progress in maternal mortality. There have been significant gains in infant mortality, institutional births and replacement level fertility. However, there is still a high unmet need for family planning and improved access is required to contraceptive services and safe abortions. A recent modelling study showed that because of the reduction in coverage of essential services, the prevalence of wasting in children could increase by 10% to 50%. There could also be 60% more maternal deaths because interventions like the administration of uterotonics and antibiotics, and clean birth environments, are no longer available.

COVID-19 has also disrupted the education system. It has also adversely affected access to nutritious food as a huge number of children depend on school meals.

Another worrying development is the surge in domestic violence. In India, a third of women said that they had previously experienced domestic violence, but less than 1% sought help from the police. Governments can include response to violence against women in the package of essential services.

Many women have lost their work and livelihoods. More women than men work in the informal economy and therefore their income fell by over 60% during the first month of the pandemic. In India, the number of women and girls living in extreme poverty is expected to increase from 87 million to 100 million.

A few months ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) emphasised the importance of gender analysis and gender-responsive public health policies. One of the major issues is the lack of availability of data that is disaggregated by sex and age. We also do not have data on violence against women and children. We have urged WHO Member States to collect data, report and analyse it, disaggregated by sex, and include responses to violence against women as an essential service.

Over 70% of countries reported partial or complete disruption of immunisation services. Other services disrupted include diagnosis and treatment of non-communicable diseases, cancer diagnosis and treatment, family planning, contraception, antenatal care, malaria and TB case detection, treatment facility-based births, and urgent blood transfusions, as well as emergency surgery. This will have a huge impact. On the one hand, essential services have to be provided; on the other hand, we must ensure financial protection. This can be guaranteed only if there is either a health coverage scheme, like Ayushman Bharat, or through private health insurance.

Out-of-pocket payments cause about 100 million to fall into extreme poverty every year, and 800 million globally spend more than 10% of their household budget on healthcare. The World Health Organization has been urging countries to ensure financial protection and effective coverage of health services.

The effective coverage index is a useful measure of the quality of health services — it looks at the provision and efficacy of services in terms of health outcomes. This metric suggests that 3.1 billion people worldwide would still not be covered if we continue to do what we’re doing. The index enables us to move away from just measuring process towards measuring outcomes. Many countries do not have the data systems to be able to accurately measure both mortality and the incidence of certain diseases. India needs to invest more in its vital registration system.

What can we do better?

Many countries have moved to digital technology, especially using platforms to provide telemedicine, for example, to overcome the problem that people could not meet physically. Platforms like ECHO have been used in many States to train healthcare workers and the government’s e-Sanjeevani platform is enabling telemedicine appointments.

We now have a national digital health blueprint and a road map. We want to move towards electronic and portable health records. It is important to think about not only data governance principles, but also new ways of collecting, using and sharing data, enabling local, contextualised decision-making.

We also need to think about working with the private sector, which is already playing a very big role in technology. But we need to think about technologies that are considered public health goods. At the Aravind Eye Hospital in Puducherry, for example, they did an experiment with shared medical appointments. This seemed to result in better health outcomes as well as higher productivity, apart from reducing costs and saving a lot of time for doctors.

We need to further integrate social protection systems, food systems and health systems in order to really have an impact on nutrition. India has done much to ensure these services, but it needs to expand these to protect its most vulnerable population groups. We must ensure that the pandemic does not further increase food insecurity.

False or misleading information leads to harmful behaviours, and mistrust in governments and the public health response. In the last eight months we have done an incredible amount of work with many tech companies. But infodemic management is not straightforward; it is linked to people’s beliefs and behaviour. Therefore, we’ve set up a behavioural insights group to provide advice on behaviour change.

We often think about health as purely as delivery of services to take care of the sick. The risk factors and the social and environmental determinants of health, such as the quality of water and air impact our health. But investments here are much more difficult as they lie outside the health sector. It is a question of all arms of the government looking at the impact of their policies on health.

Empowering our frontline health workers will yield rich dividends. We need to invest in them to ensure that they have the tools they need, receive regular training and mentoring, and are well paid.

We need to invest in strong institutional mechanisms and capacities in our regulatory bodies, research centres and public health institutions. We have seen so much fear, stigma and discrimination circulated on social media. This must be countered by health literacy.

India is on the path to investing in Universal Health Coverage. Financial resources are very important for this, but we also need investment in human resources and to engage and empower communities. A health system cannot only be about the supply side. It has to keep in mind how to involve citizens and the people it is trying to serve and have them involved in developing the services that we are bringing to them.

342,2020/10/27,"Contesting neighbours, revised geopolitical playbooks","The engagement by India and China in the West Asia region is a good example of their metamorphosing approaches

The year 2020 has been a watershed moment for relations between India and China following the most serious clashes between the two countries in the Galwan region of Ladakh since the 1962 war; relations between New Delhi and Beijing are at new lows. These events have had a cascading effect on the very thought process of foreign policy, not just for New Delhi with regard to its neighbourhood but also Beijing’s understanding of its own threat perceptions as well.

What dictates alignment now

Strategic autonomy is today a term New Delhi’s power corridors are well-acquainted with. According to a former Foreign Secretary of India, Vijay Gokhale, the ideation of ‘strategic autonomy’ is much different from the Nehruvian era thinking of ‘non-alignment’. Speaking in January 2019, Mr. Gokhale said: “The alignment is issue based, and not ideological.”

For Beijing and New Delhi, one region where both contesting neighbours have employed similar versions of ‘non-alignment’ thinking is in West Asia, and the ethos of equitable engagement with the three poles of power in Saudi Arabia, Iran and Israel, without stepping into the entanglements of the region’s multi-layered conflicts and political fissures. Such were the commonalities in thinking that at one point in time, suggestions were made to construct an ‘importers OPEC’ in order to put forward the interests of major oil importers, mostly developing Asian economies, against the producers’ cartel. However, the year 2020 and the tectonic geopolitical shifts it has brought in its wake, from deteriorating U.S.-China ties, to the COVID-19 pandemic that started in China, followed by the Ladakh crisis, is forcing a drastic change in the geopolitical playbooks of the two Asian giants, and, by association, global security architectures as well.

Pre-dating 2020, India’s outreach to West Asia sharpened since 2014 with the coming of the Narendra Modi government. As the powerful and oil-rich Gulf states looked for investment alternatives away from the West to deepen their own strategic depth, persuaded by Mr. Modi’s centralised decision-making style, India doubled down on its relations with the likes of Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, giving open economic and political preference to the larger Gulf region. While engagements with Israel moved steadily forward, Iran lagged behind, bogged down by U.S. sanctions, which in turn significantly slowed the pace of India-Iran engagements.

Advantage Beijing

Meanwhile, China’s overtures have been steadily more adventurous as it realises two major shifts that have taken place in West Asia. First, Beijing has tried to capitalise around the thinking in the Gulf that the American security safety net is not absolute, and they need to invest more in others. China, being second only to the U.S. in both economic and military terms today, is the obvious engagement. The fact that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) obtained Chinese Wing Loong drones in 2016 — a copy of U.S.’s infamous armed MQ-9 ‘Reaper’ drone that Washington refused to sell — offers a good example of the Gulf’s resolve of attaining military capabilities from wherever possible. Second, the Gulf economies such as Saudi Arabia, even though attempting a hard shift away from their addiction to the petro dollar, will still need growing markets to sell oil to in the coming decade as they reform their economic systems. The obvious two markets here are China and India.

Sharp contrasts

However, Beijing’s recent plays in the region have not been subtle. A report in September shone light on a $400 billion, 25-year understanding between Iran and China, with Beijing taking advantage of U.S. President Donald Trump’s abandonment of the Iran nuclear deal. Scholars such as Scott J. Harr have pontificated that China is no longer happy with a passive role in West Asia, and through concepts such as “negative peace” and “peace through development”, in concert with tools such as the Belt and Road Initiative, Beijing is now ready to offer an alternative model for “investment and influence”. Over the past month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during an in-person meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested the development of a “new forum” to address the region’s tensions — an alternative to the West-led ecosystems that have prevailed for decades. It remains to be seen, however, how China balances itself between the poles of power while backing one so aggressively.

From India’s perspective, as it maintains its trapeze-wire balancing act of diplomacy in West Asia, the overt outreach to the Gulf and the ensuing announcements of multi-billion-dollar investments on Indian shores by entities from Saudi Arabia and the UAE is only New Delhi recognising the economic realities of the region. Despite entanglements in the Yemen war and general tensions between the Gulf states and Iran, the likes of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and so on have maintained relatively strong and stable economic progression. Israel’s recent peace accords with the UAE and Bahrain add much further weight towards a more stable Gulf region — the caveats withstanding that the operationalisation of the accords is smooth and long-lasting.

The theory of interests superseding ideology in foreign policy is fast unravelling practically, both from the perspectives of India and China. While in the recent past, the Indo-Pacific, with the development of the Quad, has taken centre stage, other geographies such as West Asia have also started to showcase bolder examples of New Delhi and Beijing’s metamorphosing approaches towards the international arena.

343,2020/10/27,The shade of grey: On FATF's mandated tasks,"Pakistan has little option but to complete its FATF mandated tasks in the next four months

The decision by the Paris-based watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force, last week to retain Pakistan on its greylist has clearly disappointed the Imran Khan government. His cabinet had projected confidence that the country would be taken off the greylist — monitored jurisdictions on terror financing and money laundering activities — having been cleared on 21 of the 27 mandated action points. Pakistan will now face international strictures on its markets and on its ability to procure loans until the next FATF plenary in February 2021, by which time it is expected to complete the six pending issues. A bigger problem for Islamabad was that Turkey was the only other country in the 39-member FATF to push for Pakistan to be let off, by making a suggestion that the last six points be cleared by an “on-site” visit by an FATF team. The proposal was dropped when even other traditional backers of Pakistan such as China, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia did not support it. Clearly, Pakistan has little option but to complete its tasks in the next four months, which include: more action against UNSC-banned terrorists and terror groups, action against charitable organisations (Non-Profits) linked to these banned entities, tracing fugitive terrorists and pursuing convictions against them, revising the list of banned entities under the Anti-Terrorism Act to reflect all those banned by the UNSC, and cracking down on other channels of terror financing through narcotics and smuggling.

For those in New Delhi watching the outcome of the FATF decision, there are some broader dividends to consider from this process. To begin with, the fact that the FATF has retained Pakistan on the greylist for the third time this year, and not automatically downgraded it to the blacklist (with Iran and North Korea) when its deadline for action ended in September 2019, has ensured the pressure has continued to make Pakistan accountable on terror. The Khan government has been forced to make a real legislative push to bring Pakistani anti-terror laws in line with international standards, while, at least for the interim, also ensuring sufficient pressure on groups such as the LeT and the JeM that target India, to refrain from public comments and publicly raising funds. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s support to the U.S.-led Afghan process and talks with the Taliban are crucial to the peace process, and the FATF process has made Islamabad more amenable to helping Afghanistan. It remains to be seen if the actions it takes will permanently change Pakistan’s course in supporting and sheltering cross-border terror groups. India’s eventual goal is not just in stopping attacks by these groups, but for Pakistan to fully dismantle the infrastructure of terror in the understanding that it is in Pakistan’s own interests to do so. It is hoped that the prolonged FATF process will enable this realisation in Islamabad.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-shade-of-grey-on-fatfs-mandated-tasks/article32947421.ece
344,2020/10/27,Clearing the air: On Trump's criticism on India air quality,"Trump’s criticism may be gratuitous, but India’s air quality needs urgent attention

President Donald Trump’s scathing description of India’s air as “filthy” may have come as an embarrassment for the government, but it has not provoked a fierce nationalistic backlash in response to a foreign leader’s insult. Looking at the worsening pollution in northern parts of the country, triggered by stubble burning and later the Dussehra festivities, even Mr. Trump’s critics found no cudgels to pick up, while others readily agreed with him. The U.S. President’s remarks are, of course, gratuitous, considering that he has spent his term dismantling many environmental regulations, including those relating to pollution and emissions from coal plants and automobiles; his criticism of India and China is also incongruent as they have pledged to implement the Paris Agreement while Mr. Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the pact. Unfortunately, mere resolve cannot raise India’s stature. Sensors of the Central and State Pollution Control Boards and other private stations across the north currently show PM2.5, or fine particulate matter levels, in the very unhealthy or even hazardous bands. There is mounting concern about the health impacts, but the Centre has so far attempted to brazen it out by denying any confirmed link between bad air quality and a shorter lifespan. Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar last year said no Indian study on such a correlation was available. That view has been challenged, and WHO expressed worry about the situation. There is the added dimension of COVID-19 infection today, with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health contending that a one microgramme rise in PM2.5 is associated with an 8% increase in the death rate due to the novel coronavirus, based on long-term exposure data in the U.S.

India is seeking to address its chronic air quality crisis partly by raising emission standards and fuels. The country adopted the BS-VI fuel standard earlier this year, potentially lowering vehicular pollution, although the national air quality standard for annual average PM2.5 is 40 mcg per cubic metre, which is four times the WHO limit. It took the COVID-19 lockdown to let people experience clean air once again, with the conspicuous absence of vehicles. The unlock phase has reversed the ephemeral experience, as the burning of vehicular fuels has reverted to pre-lockdown levels, with no significant transition to green mobility, such as bicycle use, in urban centres. Continued burning of crop stubble in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh shows that the central sector scheme providing remedies in the form of farm mechanisation and management alternatives needs fresh impetus. No more time can be lost in addressing the crisis of foul air, as the country prepares to hasten with development in a post-COVID-19 era.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/clearing-the-air-on-trumps-criticism-on-india-air-quality/article32947422.ece
345,2020/10/27,Three-year deadline to complete suburban rail link to airport,"The cost of the entire 148-km rail network is estimated at ₹15,767 crore

The long awaited suburban rail project, which is finally inching closer to reality, will see the link to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) being given priority.

The Central government, while sanctioning the project, has indicated that suburban rail linking KIA with the city will be prioritised. Rail Infrastructure Development Company (Karnataka) Limited (K–RIDE), the special purpose vehicle implementing the project, will take up the Bengaluru City – Devanahalli Line in the first phase. The proposed alignment also connects Yeshwantpur and Yelahanka before reaching Devanahalli. The length of the line is 41.4 km.

The suburban rail project recently received approval of the Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs, and the document states that the 148-km project, with four corridors, will be completed in six years and Bengaluru City-Devanahalli with airport link has been planned for completion within three years after sanction.

A K-RIDE official said, “We have received sanction for implementing the project. The K-RIDE board will meet and decide on the future course of action. Land assessments and other related works are in progress. The tender is likely to be floated in November.”

The other three corridors of the project are Baiyappanahalli to Chikkabanavara (25 km), Kengeri to Whitefield (35.52 km) and Heelalige to Rajankunte (46.24 km).

Rail activists had demanded that the Bengaluru City to Devanahalli line be taken up on priority. The South Western Railway (SWR) has announced that it will operate train services to KIA using the existing railway line. An MoU has been signed by BIAL and SWR on managing the new halt station that has come up near the airport. The cost of the train ticket from KSR Bengaluru to the airport is likely to be ₹30.

Project cost

The suburban rail project is expected to cost ₹15,767 crore. The Central and Karnataka governments will bear 20% each, and the rest will be borrowed from banks and multilateral funding agencies. The project requires ₹1,470 crore for land, and ₹4,125 crore for alignment, formation and airport connectivity. The station building has been estimated at ₹1,981 crore. Other major spending includes ₹1,050 crore for traction and power supply, and ₹1,373 for signalling.

“K-RIDE will approach international funding agencies, such as JICA, ADB and EIB, for implementing the project,” an official said.

K-RIDE is also looking for private investments in development stations and running trains. The agency has floated tenders to study land developments and is hopeful of getting private investments for more than 30 stations proposed on the suburban rail alignment.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/unth9a/article32946933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGSUBURBANRAILP3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/three-year-deadline-to-complete-suburban-rail-link-to-airport/article32946934.ece
346,2020/10/27,BBMP to seek HC permission to clear encroachments on SWDs,"Relief cheques issued to all flood-affected families in Hosakerehalli, Uttarahalli, Kumaraswamy Layout

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) will be approaching the Karnataka High Court seeking lifting of the ban in removing encroachment on the stormwater drain (SWD) network in the city.

BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad told The Hindu that the civic body would seek the court’s permission to take up the encroachment clearing drive once again. Earlier this year, the Karnataka High Court issued a blanket stay till November-end on clearing encroachments on drains.

The city has a 842-km SWD network. With the heavy rains flooding several areas, especially in Hosakerehalli, Kumaraswamy Layout and Uttarahalli wards, the chinks in the civic infrastructure have been exposed, more so the immediate need to clear encroachments to ensure smooth flow of water.

Attempts by the BBMP have not always been successful since many owners of buildings encroaching the drains went to court and got a stay.

In April this year, the BBMP, in a statement submitted to the High Court, had claimed to have cleared 1,890 of the 2,626 encroachments. Of the rest, 348 were buildings that have been marked for demolition by the Department of Survey, Settlement and Land Records. The survey of the remaining 369 encroachments was under progress, the civic body had maintained.

Compensation cheques

Meanwhile, the BBMP has issued cheques to families that were affected by the flooding last week. While 304 affected families in Hosakerehalli ward received cheques, the relief was also given to 40 families in Kumaraswamy Layout and 181 in Uttarahalli wards.

As was announced by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, each affected family received a cheque of ₹25,000. While ₹ 10,000 was from the State Disaster Relief Fund, the remaining was from the BBMP, Mr. Prasad said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-to-seek-hc-permission-to-clear-encroachments-on-swds/article32946882.ece
347,2020/10/27,Quantum of festival waste dips,"Officials attribute this to low-key celebrations

With the outbreak of COVID-19 in the city, the celebrations of Ayudha Puja and Vijayadashami have been low-key. This has been reflected in the quantum of festival waste generated, say officials of the Solid Waste Management (SWM) cell of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).

Festival waste, largely comprising banana stems, ash gourds and flowers, was generated over the past two days. Every year, around 20% excess waste is generated during the last two days of Dasara festival. This year, however, with celebrations low-key, the waste generated was just around 10% in excess, officials added.

The civic body had identified traditional markets and other vending places, and organised additional trips by compactors and auto tippers to clear the waste.

However, in many places, the waste-laden vehicles were still seen parked by the side of the roads.

This, SWM cell officials, explained was because all processing plants and even the landfill were closed on the occasion of Ayudha Puja.

Every day, the BBMP has been sending nearly 1,500 tonnes of waste to the six waste processing plants. Around 300 truck loads of mixed waste are dumped in the landfill at Mittaganahalli.

“On Sunday, none of the plants functioned. That apart, just a little over 100 loads were dumped in the landfill.

The Ranga Shankara Theatre Festival, which has gone digital for the first time, begins on Tuesday. Due to the pandemic, the Bengaluru-based theatre group has decided to stream – and not stage – five plays and a workshop of former Shankar Nag Theatre Award recipients.

These six works, along with short-films and webcasts, among others, will also be streamed on a big screen on the theatre premises for up to 30 people.

“We are calling this year’s festival a hybrid one, born out of extraordinary circumstances but equally extraordinary solidarity. We have worked hard to ensure that the festival replicates the resilience of the human spirit and will be a celebration in every sense,” said Arundhati Nag, founder, Ranga Shankara.

Abhishek Majumdar’s Salt, Mohit Takalkar’s The Colour Of Loss, Anurupa Roy’s Teelapur Ka Rakshasha, Sankar Venkateswaran’s Criminal Tribes Act, and QTP’s Lunch Girls are the plays that will be streamed.

The six-day festival features an online discussion on the changing perspectives of theatre production, featuring veteran producers and hosted by production manager Toral Shah.

“I am very excited for them, as well as Ranga Shankara, and hope we can reach a much bigger audience because of the digital necessity this year,” added Ms. Nag.

349,2020/10/27,Homeless and hungry woman rescued from open field in Bengaluru,"Nasreen, was abandoned by her husband Nayeemul Alamin as he was unable to take care of her

Hungry, homeless and abandoned: the human cost of the COVID-19 outbreak can be seen in the many stories emerging as its fallout. A 30-year-old woman, who was found lying semi-conscious at an open field in Munnekolala, East Bengaluru, was rescued by members of a city-based NGO on Sunday.

The victim, Nasreen, was abandoned by her husband Nayeemul Alamin as he was unable to take care of her, according to Kaleemullah from Swaraj Abhiyan, who, along with his team, rescued her.

The couple, from West Bengal, had settled down in Thubarahalli camp a few years ago. While Mr. Alamin worked as a construction labourer, Ms. Nasreen worked as a maid at an apartment. But during the lockdown, the couple lost their jobs and suffered without money or food. A few days ago, Ms. Nasreen fell ill and grew anaemic without proper nourishment and medicine, the volunteers said.

Frightened, Mr. Alamin, who had no money for treatment, took Ms. Nasreen on his bicycle on the pretext of going to a hospital, but dumped her in the open field and fled. A few locals, growing suspicious, took a picture of him leaving. Later, some of them noticed Ms. Nasreen lying abandoned for many days and alerted Mr. Kaleemullah, who was helping migrant labourers during the lockdown.

Ms. Nasreen subsequently told the people that she had not had food for four days. When the rescue team tried to feed her, she started throwing up. She was then taken to Bowring Hospital, where she was admitted at the COVID-19 centre for further treatment.

There are over 5,000 people from West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Odisha, and North Karnataka living in the colonies of Munnekolala and Thubarahalli. They work as maids and construction labourers in the adjacent areas. As the lockdown was announced, most of them lost work and many left the camps, while others hoped that things would get better. But many are yet to find work again, with apartment associations not allowing them in as part of COVID-19 preventive measures.

“We are doing whatever is possible from our side to help them, but that is not enough,” said Zia Nomani, who was part of the rescue team. The team, with the help of locals, are now on the lookout for Mr. Alamin, who is absconding. “We want to trace him to help him and reunite him with his wife after treatment,” Mr. Kaleemullah said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/w4v7tk/article32949968.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NASREENBENGALURU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/homeless-and-hungry-woman-rescued-from-open-field-in-bengaluru/article32947948.ece
350,2020/10/27,Onion priced at over ₹100 a kg as wholesale-retail price gap widens,"At a grocery store near you, the onion, a staple in most homes, has been selling in the range of ₹100 to ₹120 a kg for a few days now. While extensive crop damage due to heavy rains in August-September has created a demand-supply gap in the market, driving onion prices north, retailers are allegedly artificially increasing the prices, earning a windfall.

The wholesale price of onion at the Yeshwantpur APMC market is in the range of ₹60 to ₹70, according to Udayashankar, president of Bangalore Onion and Potato Traders’ Association.

“In fact, arrivals improved over the past week and onions from Molakalmuru and Indore are coming into the market. The stocks are better when compared to previous weeks. This has also led to some correction in the wholesale price,” said Ravi Kumar, senior onion merchant at the Yeshwantpur yard.

But the retail prices are still abnormally high, with no signs of a correction. “Usually the difference between the wholesale and retail price at this cost price is around ₹10, accounting for transport and profit margin. But many retailers seem to be selling them for a windfall margin of ₹30 to ₹40 a kg,” said a senior procurement officer at a retail grocery chain in the city. The retail chain he works for was selling onion at ₹85 a kg on Monday.

“Retail prices of onions have crossed the ₹100 mark in several metro cities across the country, and this has even turned into an election issue in Bihar. This has since dominated media reports, in both national and regional media. This narrative has given licence to retailers to jack up prices artificially,” said a senior onion wholesale trader, who did not wish to be named. “In our case, there have been arrivals from Molakalmuru, Chitradurga, though not as much as in previous years, apart from arrivals from Nashik and Indore,” he said.

However, given that the next crop of onion is expected only by January and the present crop yield is already depleting against the demand, the wholesale price is only expected to increase. It might breach the ₹100 mark in the coming months, Mr. Udayashankar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/at4gl0/article32947919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGONIONP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/onion-priced-at-over-100-a-kg-as-wholesale-retail-price-gap-widens/article32947920.ece
351,2020/10/27,Chennai City Police distribute scarves to women shoppers in T. Nagar,"Move is aimed at preventing chainsnatching incidents, says DCP

To prevent chainsnatching incidents in the busy areas of T. Nagar, the police have adopted a novel measure of distributing scarves to women shoppers for covering the neck.

The idea was conceived by Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), T. Nagar, D.N. Hari Kiran Prasad.

“As chain-snatching incidents happen mostly when women are on the move on the busy streets while looking at the displays in the shop windows, we believe that scarves can deny the offenders a chance to strike,” Mr. Prasad said.

At the entry point of the shopping areas, the police stand and conduct body temperature tests on shoppers before letting them into shops.

They also hand out scarves to them free of cost and insist that they wear it.

M. Kalaiarasan, Mambalam inspector, said, “We distribute 500 free pieces to shoppers daily. This has received good response from the public. We also distribute them at bus stands and other places.”

More than 1,200 CCTV cameras installed around the shopping areas would be activated. In addition to carrying out surveillance using drones, police personnel with body cameras would also be deployed to monitor the crowds.

Facial recognition

And there are also cameras with facial recognition technology, which can easily detect the presence of history-sheeters in the crowd. The cameras have been installed on Usman Road, Ranganathan Street and near the Mambalam railway station.

Watch towers have also been erected, where policemen will be watching the public using binoculars. A temporary control room, too, has been established.

Shopkeepers have been asked to reduce the extension of their displays before their shops so that people can walk freely without any hindrance on Ranganathan Street and surrounding areas. In order to ensure free movement of pedestrians on Ranganathan Street, barricades have been placed in the middle of the street.

Those entering the busy shopping area can walk on one side of the barricaded area and come out on the other.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lqmcr0/article32948403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26OCTTHSCARVES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-city-police-distribute-scarves-to-women-shoppers-in-t-nagar/article32948404.ece
352,2020/10/27,Kerala police take away woman living with friend in Nungambakkam,"They had met through social media

A police team from Kerala on Saturday took a 21-year-old woman away from a house in Nungambakkam, where she had been staying with her female partner, acting on a ‘missing person’ complaint from her parents.

The police said the two women had become close friends on a social media platform. Following this, the woman from Kozhikode moved to Chennai to stay with her friend.

Her parents, who were opposed to this relationship, filed a complaint with the Kozhikode police, alleging that she had gone missing.

The Kerala police, accompanied by a sub-inspector from the Nungambakkam police station, on Saturday allegedly forced the 21-year-old to accompany them to Kozhikode.

When she was produced before a magistrate there, she said she would stay with her parents for 10 days.

Senior lawyer Sudha Ramalingam, however, said the police should not have taken her away, and should have instead directed her to present herself voluntarily, if needed.

A senior police officer in Chennai said she was not forcibly taken away, and the city police had merely accompanied the Kerala police and were not involved in escorting her.

“She said she would appear before the magistrate and return to Chennai,” the officer added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/kerala-police-take-away-woman-living-with-friend-in-nungambakkam/article32948329.ece
353,2020/10/27,A quiet Vijayadasami for schools this year,"Parents choose to wait out pandemic even as institutions conduct online admission drives

While Vijayadasami annually sees several parents make a beeline for pre-schools and early learning centres to get children started on their learning journey, this year it was a lot more subdued, with schools having remained shut since March.

Some parents are choosing to wait till schools reopen while a few others are considering online sessions offered by pre-schools and early learning centres.

At Alphabet School, the entire admission process has shifted online and Anil Saraf, CFO, said they had been receiving enquiries throughout the last few months as for Vijayadasami.

“Parents who want their children to be engaged and have them continue their learning have shown interest in online sessions. For Vijayadasami as well, the entire process was carried out online — parents were asked to submit applications through our website and we then processed them,” he explained.

Madhura Visweswaran, co-founder and principal, Redwood Montessori School, said parents who had been enquiring about admissions were briefed in-depth by the teachers and administrative team of the school.

“Parents have been told that they can either opt to enroll their child to attend sessions online or register and begin classes with us once schools reopen. Our school firmly believes that the focus at present should be on the emotional well being of children,” she said.

Their online sessions for children over the age of three, she said, were hands-on and interactive and strictly adhered to the dictates of screen time laid down by WHO and UNICEF.

“The child’s holistic development is kept in mind with a special focus on their emotional well-being,” she added.

A few private schools that had called for admissions asked parents visit the campuses to complete admission formalities.

“We had strict norms for physical distancing in place and had parents and children come in to complete admission formalities for those who enrolled in kindergarten,” said B. Purushothaman, senior principal, Everwin group of schools.

With no information yet on when schools will reopen, some pre-schools in the city said they did not invite admissions and had chosen to wait till there was some clarity to this effect.

“Instead of having longdrawn online sessions which children, especially those below 5 years, will not take to, it is best that parents are provided with resources such as activity suggestions and videos by pre-schools that they can engage their children with,” said K.R. Maalathi, founder, Happy Tots, an early education program.

The Tamil Nadu School Education Department opened up admissions for kindergarten and Class I in government schools across the State on Monday. A senior official from the Elementary Education Department said they were expecting a good response from parents as in the case of admissions to all other classes so far.

Schools had also been instructed to distribute free books once the admission formalities were completed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/q9v07c/article32948321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26OCTTHVIJAYADASMI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-quiet-vijayadasami-for-schools-this-year/article32948322.ece
354,2020/10/27,45-year-old five-storey building on Peter’s Road collapses,"Weak structure cited as reason for the accident; no casualties reported

A 45-year-old, five-storey, unoccupied building on Peter’s Road just opposite New College collapsed in Royapettah on Monday night. No casualties have been reported so far.

The building was built on a 1,560 sq ft plot of land by a businessman from Kerala, and four more floors were later constructed. The building was earlier occupied by 14 tenants. The family of a former Congress MP bought the building from the original owner, after which 13 tenants vacated the premises.

The remaining tenant occasionally used the premises. The family of the former MP had instituted a civil case against her.

The building collapsed around 9 p.m. after the tenant and her son left the premises.

On receiving the alert, the police and the Fire and Rescue Services personnel rushed to the spot and began operations.

Deputy Commissioner of Police, Triplicane, G. Dharmarajan and other police officers visited the spot.

Traffic on Peter’s Road was hit as the search and rescue operations were under way. “We have contacted the owner of the building for enquiry,” a police officer said.

The building collapse resulted in a huge cloud of dust and sand, residents said.

356,2020/10/27,Women will give Stalin a befitting reply for supporting VCK chief: Murugan,"DMK leader will not even be able to step out now, says BJP leader

DMK president M.K. Stalin will no longer be able to step out or go anywhere in the State, as women are waiting to give him a befitting reply for supporting a person (VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan) who insulted them, BJP State unit president L. Murugan said.

“Dear Mr. Stalin, our mothers and sisters are waiting to give a befitting reply to you, at the right time. Wherever you go from now, my mothers and sisters will reply to you in their own style. You will no longer be able to step out, or go anywhere,” Mr. Murugan said at an event at the party headquarters on Monday.

Mr. Murugan said the DMK was directly supporting someone who had insulted women. “His job is to just support these people,” Mr. Murugan said. “The BJP is a party that respects and worships women. Some [other parties] are insulting them,” he said. He, again, accused the DMK of supporting YouTube channel Karuppar Koottam.

When asked about the Manusmriti, Mr. Murugan said the book did not exist, and that a smokescreen was being created about it. “How can you ban something that is not there? Where is the proof of the book? There is no Manu needhi in India; just the Indian Constitution. The government functions on the basis of the Constitution and nothing else,” he said.

Mr. Murugan also said that he would not contest in the upcoming Assembly elections in the State, and, would rather work to ensure that the BJP has its representatives in the Assembly in 2021.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rffxve/article32948070.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26TH-LT-BJPSTATEPRESIDENTLMURUGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/women-will-give-stalin-a-befitting-reply-for-supporting-vck-chief-murugan/article32948071.ece
357,2020/10/27,BJP leader seeks inclusion of private schools in medical quota,"Letter to Governor was signed by BJP leader Nandakumar; party distances itself from representation

The BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit faced embarrassment on Monday when it transpired that its education cell secretary, K.R. Nandakumar, in his capacity as an office-bearer of an association of private schools, wrote to Governor Banwarilal Purohit seeking inclusion of private school students, who studied in Tamil, in the proposed 7.5% horizontal quota for medical admissions for NEET-qualified State government school students.

State BJP president L. Murugan was quick to issue a statement distancing the party from the demand. He said the letter was written by Mr. Nandakumar in his capacity as the general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Nursery, Primary, Matriculation, Higher Secondary and CBSE Schools Association. Mr. Nandakumar also clarified that he did not send the representation as a BJP leader.

In the letter to Mr. Purohit, the association said it was unfair to students of private schools that the horizontal quota would be applicable only for government school students.

“We are asking that at the bare minimum, private school students who have had their education in Tamil be given 7.5% quota in medical admissions. Everyone who is born in Tamil Nadu must have an equal law. The ruling party and the opposition must take into account the welfare of the students and frame laws than for their political gain and selfishness,” he said.

Mr. Nandakumar said providing the quota for all types of students alone would constitute an impartial legislation and the government should issue a G.O. to that effect. The Tamil Nadu Governor must also ensure this, the association said.

“If our representation is not accepted, our association will definitely obtain a stay from the courts and will ensure that the rights of private school students are protected,” he said.

Mr. Nandakumar’s stand on the issue is in contrast to the BJP’s position that the 7.5% horizontal quota must be implemented in the State.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/9u5cot/article32266452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BJPSTATEPRESIDENTLMURUGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bjp-leader-seeks-inclusion-of-private-schools-in-medical-quota/article32948029.ece
358,2020/10/27,"Five cross-breed dogs, trained in Chennai, to join RPF in Kashmir","The Bakharwal-Dutch Shepherd is known for being fearless and for their guarding instincts

As part of their training, five dogs — Bullet, Blackie, Jackie, Oscar and Jennie — at the Railway Protection Force (RPF) kennel in Perambur, climb up and down a vertical ladder covered with fencing wires.

What is peculiar about them is that they are a cross-breed between the Kashmiri Bakharwal and the Dutch Shepherd, both known for their fearlessness, intelligence and guarding instincts.

They will soon join the RPF in Kashmir on a trial basis. “They will be used for multitasking. This includes remaining alert, assault and barrack guarding,” said S. Louis Amuthan, Deputy Chief Security Commissioner of the RPF, who brought the Bakharwal breed, the mother of these dogs, from Kashmir.

He said Arunkumar, the Director General of the RPF, and IG Veerandrakumar were keen on inducting local breeds into the RPF.

While many pure-bred native Indian dogs have already joined the Indian Army and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Mr. Amuthan decided to experiment with the Bakharwal dogs as he had an opportunity to watch the breed in close quarters during his tenure in Kashmir.

“Bakharwal dogs are kept by the Bakharwal nomadic tribes of Kashmir and they are a very independent and fearless breed. The tribe will not part with their dogs, but I was able to get one from an employee of the RPF,” said Mr. Amuthan.

Brought up purely on vegetarian food, the Shepherd dogs have low breeding capacity. They can easily scale a wall and they were used as frontline dogs by the British during the War of Independence in 1857.

On the decline

“Their population, however, is on the decline. Many of them were killed by Kashmiri militants as they proved a nuisance to their secret activities in the Valley. Once they sense an outsider, they will bark continuously and in the process alert everyone,” said Mr. Amuthan.

Mr. Amuthan decided to mate the female dog with a Dutch Shepherd, and she gave birth to nine puppies in February, 2020. Five of them are now being trained at Perambur.

“We found that the puppies have inherited trainable qualities. We are waiting for the dog handlers from Kashmir. Soon, they will join the RPF in Kashmir on a trial basis,” he said. Unlike their mother, the five dogs are given non-vegetarian food.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7b2nju/article32947942.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26TH-LT-DOGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/five-cross-breed-dogs-trained-in-chennai-to-join-rpf-in-kashmir/article32947943.ece
359,2020/10/27,The President who called a spade a spade,"K.R. Narayanan was creative in upholding institutional obligations of an office and preserving the republic’s equilibrium

This October 27, K.R. Narayanan would have been 100 years old. But no one would perform any rites of remembrance. Another day and another time, Narayanan would have been showcased as a prime success story of an India that made one and all ‘meritorious’ Indians believe that they could find a place under the constitutional sun. A man from an ordinary, humble background could get inducted into the elite Indian Foreign Service — all that counted was his calibre and competence. He had no godfather or a clan to speak up for him.

Example of an inclusive India

And that K.R. Narayanan would hear the call of public office, get elected to the Lok Sabha, become the Vice-President of India and preside over the Rajya Sabha, and, then, go on to occupy the Rashtrapati Bhavan, told the tale of a Nehruvian India where all that mattered was the requisite temperament and character. India could take pride that it was an open system, a democratic arrangement, and a society committed to an egalitarian social order — and was comfortable with excellence and accomplishment.

In the process, K.R. Narayanan became a prime example of an inclusive India. He had the distinction of being the first Dalit President of India. His elevation to the Rashtrapati Bhavan had more than a token significance; and, even though the new, aggressive Ambedkarites may not think much of him, his election as President did announce the arrival of a new social assertion. It needs to be kept in mind that he was the presidential choice of the United Front coalition, a political dispensation that sincerely believed that if India had to progress and become a great nation, then it must be a country for all Indians, from all strata, unimpeded with competitive parochialism.

In his long innings of public service, K.R. Narayanan conducted himself as a modern man, well-tutored in scientific temper; he became the first Indian public figure when as Vice-President, he shook hands with an HIV-infected person, whereas the self-proclaimed charismatic saviours were shying up making the gesture. He was urbane and cosmopolitan, at ease with the best and the brightest at home; he never felt over-awed and certainly never felt intimidated in the world’s chancelleries because of his immense faith in the nobility of the great democratic experiment under way in the country he represented. However, it was as the President that K.R. Narayanan repaid his debt to the republic. Circumstances demanded that he creatively explored the potential of the office; and, he turned out to be a responsible custodian of the Constitution.

Reining in Governors

In the process he became the protector of constitutional morality, the most cherished republican virtue. Most gratifyingly, he twice used his position to rein in errant Governors, even though they had the ruling establishment’s patronage.

First, it was Romesh Bhandari at the Lucknow Raj Bhavan, who fell afoul of President Narayanan’s sense of constitutional fairness. Within months of taking over as the President, Narayanan stood up to the United Front political bosses and would not go along with the I.K. Gujral cabinet’s preference to invoke Article 356 to get rid of the Kalyan Singh Government in Uttar Pradesh. In his memoirs, Matters of Discretion: An Autobiography, Gujral himself notes that the President firmly reminded him of the Bommai judgment and the Sarkaria Commission recommendations. It was the first time that a President had asked the Union Cabinet to reconsider a proposed constitutional act.

The second time President Narayanan ticked off a Governor’s conduct was in July 2001 when the Raj Bhavan in Chennai disappointingly remained a mute spectator as a former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, M. Karunanidhi (and two serving central Ministers) were roughed up by the Tamil Nadu police, at the behest of an extremely vindictive Chief Minister Jayalalitha. It was President Narayanan who suggested to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to demand a report from Tamil Nadu Governor M. Fathima Beevi. A presidential rebuke was implicit in the Rashtrapati Bhavan suggestion; soon, the Governor was recalled.

In both these instances, the Governors had allowed the Raj Bhavan to be used to give respectability to shabby political calculations. Not on his presidential watch, insisted Narayanan.

Speaking his mind

The Indian Constitution does not envisage the President of India to be a power centre, leave alone set himself up as a rival power centre (to the Prime Minister). Yet, there is always considerable wiggle room for a President to have his presence felt.

Once A.B. Vajpayee became the Prime Minister, the National Democratic Alliance bosses learnt to their discomfort that the man occupying the Rashtrapati Bhavan was no push-over. No wonder, L.K. Advani, in his memoirs, disparagingly called him an “activist president.” Perhaps, for good reason.

After its 1999 Lok Sabha victory, the BJP crowd thought that it had earned a licence to make amendments to the Constitution. There was even a commission to review the ‘working’ of the Constitution. K.R. Narayanan used the prestige and the pulpit of his office to warn the nation of inherent danger to the Constitution from small minds, strutting around with an over-inflated sense of self importance.

And, a few months later, K.R. Narayanan again made his presence felt during U.S. President Bill Clinton’s visit to India. At the Rashtrapati Bhavan banquet for the visiting American, President Narayanan horrified the ministerial posse by reminding everyone of non-alignment as an instrument of Indian foreign policy in pursuit of autonomy and independence. That was the time when the Vajpayee government was doing all it could to cosy up to the Americans. The ruling coterie was not amused; it thought the President had gone off the reservation. Yet, it was a battle that the ruling politicians lost in the face of a resolute presidential rectitude.

President Narayanan, also, had a sense of political moment. In 1999, when A.B. Vajpayee lost the vote of confidence by a solitary vote, and, when an alternative government had to be formed, he tried to nudge the non-BJP forces to suggest the possibility of the West Bengal Chief Minister, Jyoti Basu, becoming a prime ministerial choice. The upper caste Congress leaders, led by M.L. Fotedar and Pranab Mukherjee, were dead set against the idea of a ‘communist’ becoming prime minister. Had President Narayanan’s hint been taken up, there would have been no second term for A.B. Vajpayee, and there would have been no “Gujarat, 2002” and no Narendra Modi.

As the President, Narayanan was nobody’s man. A President need not be anybody’s man or woman. The Constitution thrives on a dynamic interlocking institutional balance; failure of one functionary to perform his or her dharma ends up injuring the health of the entire Republic. Narayanan demonstrated how it was possible to be brilliantly creative in upholding the institutional obligations of an office — and, preserve the republic’s equilibrium.

360,2020/10/27,"Letters to the Editor — October 27, 2020","Quota Bill

The question of 7.5% horizontal reservation for students in Tamil Nadu who have studied in government schools has unfortunately come in for unjustifiable criticism. These students are not exposed to the same conditions as those who study in private schools. The social and economic backwardness of such students cannot bear comparison to those who can afford to join private schools which are run on different lines. Further, the Governor, who acts on the aid and advice of the State Cabinet, has a limited role to play. According to Article 200 of the Constitution, he has to sign the Bill as soon as possible after its presentation. If not, he has to return the Bill requesting reconsideration, and in case the Bill is passed again, he has to give assent. When such is the peremptory language of Article 200, it is surprising the Governor is seeking time of four weeks to make a decision (Tamil Nadu, “Need 3 to 4 weeks to decide on 7.5% quota Bill, says Governor”, October 23). The Governor, instead of playing a constitutional role, is playing a controversial role, unmindful of the responsibilities of the government.

To claim that the benefit of 7.5% reservation should be equally available to those from private schools is diluting the constitutional purpose of reservation for the socially and educationally backward and is encouraging privatisation which seems to be the agenda of the Centre. There are political overtones to this issue, which ultimately has to be decided on the basis of constitutional priorities and guarantees in education for students studying in government schools.

Metrics of happiness

Happiness for a plurality of people cannot be gauged by narrow metrics (Editorial page, “Metrics of world happiness and the Muslims of India”, October 24). Rather than beneficiaries, Indian Muslims are losers/victims under Indian democracy and have been marginalised in terms of the sharing of political power and delivery of justice. Consolidation of the majority community under a prominent political party itself would lead to the entrenchment of the majority religion. Thus, the governance of India could also exclude the minorities.

There are many examples of riots against the Muslims that demonstrate their painful conditions — their dignity, self-respect and pride are fading. The rise of majoritarian hatred is unfortunate. The unvarnished fact is that happiness for the marginalised and the powerless in India is still elusive.

Raining woes

The illegal occupation of lakes, either completely or partially, in the historical city of Hyderabad is a key reason why it faces misery and destruction in extreme weather events (‘Ground Zero’ page, “The revenge of the lakes in Hyderabad”, October 24). State governments, past and present, have failed to book cases against the real estate sharks. In the name of layout regularisation schemes, governments have instead collected lakhs of rupees from innocent buyers of land. No action has been taken against the actual culprits. This farce has been allowed to continue with periodical extension of the validity of these ‘schemes’. There has to be preparation and implementation of a scientific master plan to end this urban anarchy.

Biopic ‘800’

Expectedly, the biopic, 800, on Sri Lankan cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan, has been jettisoned by actor Vijay Sethupathi, who was to play a lead role (Editorial page, “A compelling life story, lost in the fog of illogic”, October 23). Protesting against the film just because it is about the feats of a cricketer from the island nation is stifling creativity. This does not mean that the genocide in that country is correct. Sport, films and music can help bridge many divides between nations.

The pressure of ‘crowd censorship’ on the freedom to think and act cannot be wished away. Even the Governor was not spared when he attempted to clear the cobwebs in the administrative set-up in many universities. Certain political parties, some of which exist only on letter pads, appear to be forming this chorus to intimidate artistes.

T.M. Ranganathan,

Srirangam, Tamil Nadu

The attempt to portray the cricketer as a ‘hill country Tamil’ would be to whitewash the cries of Tamil mothers seeking answers and justice for their lost sons who vanished in the genocide. It is also pertinent to note that the condition of hill country Tamils, whether in Sri Lanka or India, has not improved at all. A narrative of appropriating the interests of one group to pit it against another related group would be intellectual dishonesty.

361,2020/10/27,Home cooks turn social media top chefs,"Mothers and grandmothers are increasingly taking to the Internet to explore, relive and invent recipes

Leela Mathew skins, cores and chops an apple with the flair of a master chef. The apple is to go into a smooth dough and then dunked in hot oil. Home cook Leela is making apple appam (apple fritters Indian style) for an eager online audience.

Leela Mathew

Her YouTube channel and Instagram page, ‘My Mother’s Kitchen’, has been drawing followers from around the world ever since it was launched in March, 2020. The videos are edited by her septuagenarian husband, who also handles the photography. “He learnt an editing software just for this,” says Leela, from Baltimore, USA, where she lives.

A growing tribe of people over 55 is discovering the joys of social media. For the women particularly, it is an indulgent space, where they get to show off their recipes and share fond food memories. At least for a few of them, it has also been a way to beat lockdown blues.

Okra thoran by Leela Mathew

“When I first started, I didn’t know if anyone would be interested in watching at all. But I did the show because I wanted to record how to make traditional recipes for my children,” says Leela. Her videos are mostly of traditional Malayali dishes, a few with an American twist, such as a cabbage and kale thoran or a skillet cookie, for instance.

Leela is originally from Kottayam, and adds, “I like doing things the old fashioned way. I like when I hear people say that my cooking makes them nostalgic for Kerala and reminds them of their mother.”

Sundari Krishnamurthy with her students

Traditional food is also a hit with the fans of Sundari Krishnamurthy from Chennai, who says she gets emails and messages about traditional food. She started her Instagram page four years ago, and enjoys the fact that she can connect with her followers. “And for that reason, I manage the page myself,” says Sundari, who conducts cookery classes as well. Her videos include South Indian staples such as idli and ellu milagai podi, to innovative ones such as a bottle-sprouted green gram salad.

Manjri Varde

Artist Manjri Varde, 65, whose videos with her daughter-in-law, Bollywood actor Sameera Reddy, are already hugely popular, says she has never put herself out there much before, but is enjoying the fun. “Cooking is something I have always done. During the lockdown, Sameera suggested we do a video and we enjoyed it. All the content is prepared by her and I just try to be myself,” she says. One of the first videos Manjri and Sameera posted was on how to make a rotla with leftover rice. “Back in my day, we never wasted things. So this rotla was one such recipe.”

Sameera posts at least two videos a week under her #sassysaasu, which has not just culinary, but other aspects of saas-bahu bonding with a twist. Manjri, who is currently in Goa, makes Gujarati and Maharashtrian dishes mostly, with dashes of her own improvisations.

Simple steps

While most seek the help of grandchildren and children to shoot videos, edit them and manage their accounts, the Internet offers ready solutions for seniors new to social media. From how to create an account to finding friends, tagging and other tricks and tips, help is at hand.

Nalini Menon

Nalini Menon’s YouTube channel, ‘Ennu Swantham Amma’, is managed by her son Jay. “So I am not so clued in on the number of followers, but I feel happy when absolute strangers compliment me on my dishes and ask for recipes,” says the 68-year-old from Ernakulam. Nalini cooks simple Kerala food. “I don’t take any extra effort for this. I just cook what I normally do at home – sambar, theeyal, molakushyam (a loose lentil curry) and different kinds of chutneys,” Nalini adds.

Mary Mathew

Seventy-three-year-old Mary Mathew from Kolenchery, Kerala is a fan of MasterChef Australia, which she used to watch with her grandson John, who also shares her love for cooking. When Mary started her Instagram page, @cookingfrom1970, she sent a message to Matt Preston and George Calombaris of MasterChef Australia, introducing her page. Mary wasn’t expecting a response, but George replied saying her food looked tasty and Matt advised her on how to take a good food photograph so that the dish stood out, pointing out her kappa ularthu as a good example.

Mary Mathew’s candied jackfruit

Mary posts recipes of dishes her mother used to make. Chakkapazham unakkiyathu (candied jackfruit), bilimbi thoran (bilimbi stir-fry) and boiled yam with chilli chutney to mention just a few. “I get a lot of response from people, especially for traditional dishes, and I find there is a lot of interest in age-old recipes. While in the earlier days, we used to ask neighbours and relatives for tips, now we just put it out there for anyone from the world to access,” she says.

Neena Najma

Online definitely is the way ahead, so Neena Najma, just shy of 60, joined baking and pizza making classes on the Internet. Her Instagram page (@bakeshop37) is filled with images of “new-age” confections and pizzas. Her daughter-in-law Aysha Thaniya manages her account. “I have six grandchildren at home and I can afford to do a lot of experimenting with food; it never goes to waste,” she says from Alappuzha.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/mothers-and-grandmothers-are-now-taking-to-social-media-to-explore-their-love-for-cooking/article32953890.ece
362,2020/10/27,"With time at hand, hobbyists are making fermented foods at home","A side effect of the pandemic, fermented foods such as kimchi, kombucha, and kefir are being made at home now that hobbyists finally have the time and energy to babysit SCOBY

It all started with sourdough.

The shuttered COVID-19 world has been unexpectedly productive for brewers, cheese makers and picklers.

Called “fermentos”, by sociocultural writer Michael Pollan, this growing tribe is having a field day preparing kimchi, kombucha, kefir, tepache, kvass, congee, miso, sauerkraut, Piccolo, rai-pani ka aachar and of course, sourdough: foods they may never have prepared in a workaday world.

These alchemists, and an expanding group of hobbyists, have finally found the time to watch grain and water turn to malt over days; milk to cheese; yeast and bacteria feed on sugars and distil into healthy tea.

Kochi-based Ouso Chakola has been fermenting black tea to make Jun, which he explains is, “the champagne of kombucha,” by adding honey instead of sugar. He discusses this new-found indulgence, “All fermentation is difficult in a fast-paced city life.

Modern society does not have the time to watch a bottle for a week, a month. One of the benefits of COVID-19 has been of people indulging in making fermented foods.”

Fermenting during the lockdown turned into a business venture for Chennai-based young entrepreneur Divya Kumar. Kombucha (fermented yeast tea) was a passion for Divya, an engineer who relocated to the city at the end of last year from San Francisco, US, where she lived for over 10 years working as an app developer.

“During a chat with my neighbour, I came to know that she was a kombucha brewer and I was thrilled. She gave me some SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) and I began to brew it, and distributed it to friends and relatives. But within a few weeks, the demand shot up and that is how I ended up launching East Coast Brewery, from where I bottle and sell kombuchas,” says Divya.

She functions from her home in Panaiyur, ECR, and her handcrafted fermented health drinks, labelled Divs, are available in hibiscus, sweet lime, ginger, jasmine, rose, blue pea and strawberry flavours. “Inspired by the flowers in our garden, I started experimenting. The turmeric soda pop and the hibiscus soda pop are my innovations,” says Divya.

Animal activist Ashwini Prem has also been making and retailing kambucha during lockdown in Kochi. Though she does it on a small scale — making eight litres a week for customers in her apartment — Ashwini has been experimenting by adding pineapple, chilli, dill, passion fruit and apples. “The key to making a fermented drink is using sterile utensils and bottles,” says Ashwini, who begins tasting after four days of fermentation so as not to allow it to “sour too much or turn acidic.” On bottling, she ‘burps’ the bottles daily and advises customers to consume them within four days.

Desi cultures

Noticing the trend, food show director Shubhra Chatterjee, conducted a three day seminar called ‘desi cultures’ in August, on her Instagram handle @historywali, covering traditional fermentation done in cultures across India.

Over 150 people attended to listen to 13 speakers. The gamut of Indian fermented foods, from water pickles of coastal India, jackfruit and mango in brine, and variations of kanji (cooked rice left to ferment overnight in water), to pakhala in Odisha and poita bhaat in Bengal were discussed at the seminar.

According to Shubhra, the current buzz began when Goa-based sourdough maker Sujit Sumitran taught sourdough workshops online for free in the first month of lockdown.

“It initiated many into the world of bread making. Then as awareness grew that fermented foods are good for the gut and immunity, more joined in,” she says.

Wellness chef Moina Oberoi states that fermenting is not just a trend, “it is a medical science.” She adds, “Research on microorganisms and disease started only two decades ago but traditional cuisines in India, China, Tibet and many other cultures always had a holistic look at disease and lifestyle. Fermented foods have always been a part of traditional cuisine for their health aspect.” Moina’s company Mo’s Superfoods produces kefir yogurt. A fermented milk drink, kefir has its origin in Eastern Europe and is found in different variations across Europe. Like many other fermented foods, it is on a comeback trail.

Dehradun-based food and nutrition consultant, Sangeeta Khanna, who has been actively conducting virtual classes on lacto fermentation says she ferments just about anything, including chickpeas, kidney beans (rajma), okra, colocasia, yam, aubergine and bottle gourd. “As you keep trying, you will understand the process and once you get a hang of it, you will begin to reap the health benefits. Gradually, it will become a habit,” she says.

“The biggest thing about fermentation is time and patience, which the lockdown has provided in ample measure,” says Chef Gayatri Desai, who believes that The Noma Guide to Fermentation, by David Zilber and Rene Redzepi published in 2018, was a turning point in the popularity of the trend.

She founded her restaurant Ground Up in Pune last August which serves a menu inspired by fermentation. Gayatri’s lockdown creations include a granita made using strawberry vinegar; gochujang, a Korean spice paste fermented with malt; and Doburoku, made using Japanese koji rice, to add flavour to chicken broth.

Gooseberry, fresh turmeric and ginger root pickle (recipe by Sangeeta Khanna) Ingredients

(to fill 2 jars measuring 500 ml)

Amla cut into wedges 12

large sized green chillies, preferably mild hot 12

Ginger root cleaned and sliced 150 gms

Fresh turmeric root cleaned and sliced 150 grams

Mustard powder (yellow or black) 3 tablespoon

Turmeric powder 1 tablespoon

Red chilly powder 1 teaspoon

salt to taste 1 tablespoon

Method: Slice and chop everything as desired and mix with all the ingredients in a glass bowl. Give a good toss and fill in clean jars. This pickle is ready to eat in about 3 hours and keeps changing in taste for 2-3 days. In Indian summers we keep it only for 2 days at room temperature and then refrigerate. The pickle keeps maturing slowly and get sharper in taste by time. If refrigerated it lasts about 4 weeks.

NOTE: In watery vegetables, no need to add water as the vegetables itself would release water. But if using non-watery vegetables, we can add water to soften it. This water is also nutritious and can be consumed as a drink.

Thissur-based amateur cheese maker, Anu Joseph found this time ideal to experiment with natural fermentation to make goat cheese. “ I tried fermentation without adding any culture. It took 14 to 15 hours to get the right sourness,” says Anu, who started her venture Casaro Cremary in 2018. She has a batch of ageing goat cheese, which will be ready by December. Anu also tried her hand at making wine with black grapes.

Meanwhile Divya who was brewing five litres of kombucha per week in June increased her production to bottling 150 litres a week by September. “Brewing was a way of healing for me as I was mourning for the untimely death of my father and isolated during the lockdown,” says Divya, who also conducts blind kombucha tasting sessions every Saturday in order to familiarise people with this rather unusual product.",,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/poqw0i/article32952931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpdrink5jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/a-pandemic-and-the-trend-of-fermented-foods/article32952940.ece
363,2020/10/27,Row over Maratha quota law heats up in State,"MVA govt. not serious about vacating stay: BJP

With the Supreme Court on Tuesday listing for hearing after four weeks the Maharashtra government’s pleas seeking the lifting of the stay on the implementation of the law to provide reservation to Marathas in jobs and education, the row over the quota has intensified.

While the State government claimed the upper hand by stating that the court has granted time to hand over the matter to a Constitutional Bench, the Opposition said the government had yet again failed to deliver justice to the aggrieved community.

State Minister Ashok Chavan, who heads the Maharashtra cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation, said the Bench comprising Justices L. Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi accepted the State’s plea. “Today’s proceedings in the Supreme Court are being misinterpreted by the Opposition. A technical glitch delayed the start, which happens in many cases. Senior lawyer Mukul Rohatgi represented the State’s stand that since matter has been directed to a Constitutional Bench, the proceedings to lift interim stay should also be handed over to the same Bench,” he said.

The Supreme Court on September 9 ordered an interim stay on the Maratha reservation while referring the matter to a Constitutional Bench. On October 7, the State government demanded the formation of the Bench to conduct the proceedings to lift the stay. On October 10, the apex court informed the State that the matter should be taken up by a larger Bench.

Mr. Chavan said, “However, the matter was taken up by a three-member Bench. The State government had pointed it out to the registry and applied for deletion. Still it didn’t move.” He said the State government is of the view that proceedings on lifting the interim stay should be taken up by the Constitutional Bench.

Speaking to reporters in Kolhapur, State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government was not serious about vacating the stay on the Maratha quota. “Not only the Maratha community but the entire State is suffering because of the failure of the State government. There was no coordination between lawyers. They were not prepared. This failure has delayed the admission process in the State, leading to chaos,” said Mr. Patil.

Mr. Chavan said the Opposition is misleading the community. “BJP can always become a party to this case as over nine to 10 private individuals have come in support of the reservation. The Opposition is only interested in destabilising the government and has no intention of finding solutions.” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/lrcj9c/article32958138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BMASHOKCHAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/row-over-maratha-quota-law-heats-up-in-state/article32958139.ece
364,2020/10/27,Man arrested for raping minor girl,"Accused abducted victim’s 15-year-old cousin in 2018

The Rabale police have arrested a 27-year-old man for raping and impregnating a 15-year-old girl.

Sumit Saha, who hails from Bihar, was arrested on Sunday night from Ghansoli based on his call data records. The accused helped out at a vada pav stall and befriended the girl in November 2019 while she was assisting her father, who ran another vada pav stall.

On June 12 this year, the girl complained of persistent pain in her stomach. “Her father took her for a check-up and found out that she was eight months pregnant. A complaint was then filed with the Rabale police,” Vinayak Vast, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Vashi Zone, said.

The girl said the accused raped her repeatedly in a room near their vada pav stall. The accused went absconding soon after an FIR was registered against him under Sections 376, 376 (2) (n), 376 (3) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

During interrogation, the police learnt that in 2018 the accused had abducted the girl’s 15-year-old cousin, who is still missing. “That case, which was being investigated by the Anti Human Trafficking Unit, has now been transferred to us. The accused has not yet revealed the whereabouts of the missing girl,” assistant police inspector Dattatray Dhume said.

The accused has been remanded in police custody till November 2. The girl has delivered a baby and is at her parents’ house in Ghansoli.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/man-arrested-for-raping-minor-girl/article32958043.ece
365,2020/10/27,Police detain 350 PAPs outside CIDCO Bhavan,"Residents of all 10 villages acquired for Navi Mumbai International Airport project arrived to stage protest

The Navi Mumbai Police on Tuesday detained around 350 project-affected persons (PAPs) who lived on the Navi Mumbai International Airport site after they attempted to stage a protest outside CIDCO Bhavan in Belapur.

“The villagers had put up hoardings and gave us a notice regarding the protest. However, we called them a few days ago and requested them not to go ahead with the agitation. We told them that staging protests is not allowed during the COVID-19 pandemic, but they refused to obey our orders,” said senior police inspector Dinkar Mohite from Belapur police station.

Mr. Mohite said they had to detain them for unlawful assembly, rioting and disobedience of orders issued by a public servant. The villagers were let off after an FIR was registered. While 22 people have been named in the FIR, it also mentions the presence of 300 others at the site.

Residents of all 10 villages acquired for the airport project were present for the protest. The villagers said they had given a notice about the protest to the police around 15 days ago.

“It has been three years since our struggle for our rights started. Our homes and fields have been taken away. We don’t even have a home to stay now. Though our homes have numbers, they say we are not eligible for the package,” said Avita Mundkar, a PAP.

“Every officer is silent. No one has been answering our queries. All that belonged to us has been taken and we have not been even provided with jobs. CIDCO had promised to pay us rent till we were rehabilitated. We, however, got rent only for 18 months. We are paying at least ₹10,000 in rent. Though the fisherfolk have lost their livelihood, no package has been offered to them yet,” said Ajit Mhatre, another villager.

Protesting is our democratic right and they are not allowing us to do even that, Mr. Mhatre added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/police-detain-350-paps-outside-cidco-bhavan/article32957993.ece
366,2020/10/27,Maharashtra cuts COVID-19 test charges,"The Maharashtra government on Monday slashed the rate charged for the clinical testing for COVID-19 by ₹200, to bring it down to ₹980. This is the fourth cut announced by the State as the original cost of the test was ₹4,500.

“While ₹980 will be levied by pathological laboratories, for tests conducted through laboratories at COVID-19 centres, hospitals, and quarantine centres, where a large number of samples are collected daily, ₹1,400 would be charged. Similarly, for testing samples collected from residences of suspected patients, ₹1,800 has been fixed,” Health Minister Rajesh Tope said.

The minister said that the repeated cost rationalisations were a direct consequence of keeping with the State government’s focus to ease the burden of the COVID-19 exposure upon the common man.

Maharashtra has been emphasising upon a test and trace strategy, along with precautions like donning face masks and hand sanitisers.

“The testing ratio has improved to 70,000 tests for a population density of 10,00,000 (one million) in Maharashtra. We sought this to be further improved. We are doing everything in power to put curbs on the COVID-19 infection,” Mr. Tope said.

He further said that district collectorate officials and civic commissioners had been instructed to ensure that the rates charged by the testing centres adhere strictly to the government-approved tariff structure.

Last week, the State announced curbs on prices of masks. As per the order, N-95 masks can be sold in the range of ₹19 to ₹49 while the prices of two- and three-layered masks are capped at ₹3-₹4. The government has also fixed the price of remedesivir at ₹2,360 at the centres approved by it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-cuts-covid-19-test-charges/article32948480.ece
367,2020/10/27,Ajit Pawar tests positive for COVID-19,"Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Monday announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19. He is the 11th Cabinet minister from the Maha Vikas Aghadi government to have been infected with the virus.

Mr. Pawar said, “I have tested positive for COVID-19, but my health is fine. I have been admitted to Breach Candy hospital after being advised by doctors. There is no need to worry. I will soon be active and will join you all after a brief rest.”

The Deputy CM had been quarantined for the last four days though he was earlier tested negative. “Since he had symptoms, he had quarantined himself. But he was tested negative then. However, after being testing positive, he decided to get admitted to the hospital,” a source close to Mr. Pawar said.

Mr. Pawar’s absence from the function where former BJP leader Eknath Khadse joined the NCP had raised eyebrows. Party chief Sharad Pawar had to clarify that the Deputy CM was not against Mr. Khadse’s entry but he was quarantined as a precaution.

Earlier, Cabinet ministers Jitendra Awhad, Dhananjay Munde, Ashok Chavan, Balasaheb Patil, Aslam Sheikh, Nitin Raut, Hasan Mushreef, Varsha Gaikwad, Eknath Shinde, and Anil Parab, and ministers of State Abdul Sattar, Sanjay Bansode and Vishwajeet Kadam had tested positive.

369,2020/10/27,"Let’s expect a lot, but not too much: Brearley","In Spirit of Cricket, Brearley brings the threads together, occasionally travelling outside the game into the realms of literature, philosophy and psychology to borrow concepts that are both relevant and explanatory.

When, at the turn of the century, it was decided to add a 417-word ‘Preamble’ to the Laws of cricket, I felt uncomfortable. The intentions were good, but the idea that those who played the game needed to be told such things as “it is against the spirit of the game to indulge in cheating” seemed ridiculous. It was like adding, “It is not good manners to murder your neighbour” to the criminal code.

This was the ‘spirit’ of the game — every schoolboy is taught that you played within the written laws and the unwritten spirit, except that it was now decided to write down the spirit, thereby somehow diminishing it. You cannot build a fence around intent.

It was possible to conclude that the Laws defined the game itself while the spirit was the code by which the individuals who played it were judged.

Mike Atherton initially called the spirit “a lot of meaningless guff,” but few players or writers have explored the idea in detail. Till now, that is, when Mike Brearley, the sage of the game, has done so in his Spirit of Cricket.

Brearley has written about how the concept worried him. “I used to question the notion of the spirit of cricket,” he says, “I was worried that it was nebulous and I felt that those who advocated it most strongly tended to sound patronising or pompous.” Many of the ‘traditions of the game’, he says, “are not worthy of respect.”

In Spirit of Cricket, Brearley brings the threads together, occasionally travelling outside the game into the realms of literature, philosophy and psychology to borrow concepts that are both relevant and explanatory. The book is subtitled Reflections on Play and Life.

Reading Spirit of Cricket gave me a feeling of completion, as if there is nothing more to be said on the subject. Few books, cricket or otherwise, inspire this sense of completeness. And it has been done without preaching, without getting technical, without holding back on his own self-doubts. It is quite an achievement. There are risks in the (game’s) fantasy of purity and peacefulness,” writes Brearley; it is rugged, hard, passionate and urban. Harold Pinter called it, “a wonderfully civilised act of warfare” and a “very violent game.”

Vague

If the spirit is vague, the Laws tend to be too. They are a mixture of rules and playing conditions written by different organisations — the Marylebone Cricket Club, the International Cricket Council, the national bodies all add to them. By ‘spirit’, Brearley largely means ‘fairness’, a word unlikely to annoy those who get worked up by ‘spirit’. The spirit, admits Brearley, is meant to be vague, offering pointers rather than solutions to specific issues.

The conflict with Laws arises because “We are happier with precision (and) inclined to view the material and the measurable as more real than the often unmeasurable emotional/mental.” There is the suggestion that the ‘spirit’ alters with time and circumstance. Brearley’s objection to Bodyline, for instance, is not based on moral grounds — “I am conflicted about Bodyline,” he says, “Like Greg Chappell I have a sneaking regard for what Jardine did” — but on the physical danger during an era when the batsmen were not well protected, and because the tactic was “too ruthless.” But he admits Bodyline, which involved fast bowlers aiming at the batsmen’s body with a packed leg side field, was “against the spirit of cricket.”

Atherton (in a chapter where other writers speak on the issue) has this to say: “One man’s spirit of cricket is far removed from another’s.

“As the game spreads — Afghanistan, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, America etc. — local customs will alter what has been traditionally accepted as the spirit of cricket, rendering it utterly changed from its original conception to the point where it becomes almost meaningless.”

No longer an English game

Cricket is no longer an English game alone, and will have to accept that cultural (or even moral) relativism might render redundant many concepts enshrined in the unwritten spirit.

The theatre director Ian Rickson makes the point that ‘spirit of cricket’ has gone from a colonial maxim to teach subjects to obey a system of rules to a global market run by billionaires.

Brearley’s approach is pragmatic, and a lesson for our times. “Let’s expect a lot,” he says, “but not too much.” His advice: Don’t hype cricket up into something elevated and imagine that it is too special. His hope: Cricket is special, and our better selves can prevail.

370,2020/10/27,Brace yourselves!,"What’s worse: failing your Physics exam or being attacked by a giant asteroid? It’s 2020, so you can expect just about anything!

A global pandemic, online school, lockdowns with your pesky brother, fires in the Amazon, floods, and fights along our border… 2020 is on a roll, and the year isn’t even over yet.

I am all set to cast my vote in favour of 2020 being the suckiest year in the history of humankind. I mean, find me a year worse than 2020 and I’ll give you my pesky brother. Don’t want him, you say? Well, I thought it was worth a shot.

Well, apparently there have been worse years in the history of history. For example, if you had been alive during 536 CE, you would have been witness to two massive volcanic eruptions that covered the Earth in a super-dense fog that blocked out the sun. This led to an off-the-charts temperature drop, and it was so cold that it apparently snowed during the summer. Also, because the weather was so bad and so cold, the planet didn’t produce enough crops to feed everyone. Oh, and all this was the precursor to the Justinian plague that lasted for about 20 years.

(Universe, if you’re listening, PLEASE don’t let COVID-19 last that long. I beg you.)

More in store

It only makes me wonder: what does 2020 have in store for us over the next few months? Do you think things are going to worsen? What could possibly be worse than what we’ve been living through, for the last seven months? A giant, planet-eating asteroid hits the Earth? We are attacked by alien overlords who are way smarter than the aliens in Hollywood movies and we all end up becoming worker drones for them in their giant intergalactic hive? Or maybe, COVID-19’s big sister pays us all a visit? The possibilities are endless, and each is potentially worse than the other!

I was getting pretty worked up thinking of all the terrible things that could happen to us between now and January 2021. And it was not good for me. It was so bad that I actually did my Physics homework to distract myself. Yeah, it was that bad.

I wish I could say the distraction worked, but it only stressed me out about how little attention I’d been paying during Physics class. What’s worse? Failing your Physics midterm, or being swallowed by a giant, planet-eating asteroid?

Ooh! Maybe if a giant, planet-eating asteroid swallowed us before the Physics mid-term, I’d have a way out. Well, kind of!

Steps are being taken to fill up vacancies in government departments, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said here on Monday.

Addressing a virtual press conference, the Chief Minister said the recruitment process for police constabulary would start next month.

The government had also initiated steps to fill vacancies in the electricity department.

Heads of departments had been asked to furnish details about upper and lower division clerk vacancies, the Chief Minister said.

The Labour Department had been asked to conduct more job fairs in the coming days, he added.

Blaming the Lt. Governor for the delay in providing salaries for government aided school teachers, he said the teachers are protesting for the last 10 months demanding salary.

The Chief Minister said he was again forwarding the file for financial sanction. Sanction could be given to disburse two thirds of the pending salary and the remaining could be given after checking anomalies in the amount remitted by the schools to the exchequer. The aided schools are bound to remit the tuition fee collected from the students to the government coffers.

The Chief Minister also flayed the decision of the Tamil Nadu government to register a case against VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan for his reported remarks about women.

Over 100 aided school teachers were arrested near the Immaculate Conception Cathedral on Monday while taking out a march to the Raj Nivas demanding salary and pension arrears.

The protesters had gathered in front of the Cathedral to proceed to the Raj Nivas when they were intercepted by the police. The teachers sat in a dharna and raised slogans. They were later arrested and taken to the Gorimedu police community hall when they tried to proceed with their Raj Nivas picketing plan.

The teachers federation announced in the evening that they would not be deterred by arrests and would sustain their stir until their just demands were met.

A police officer said a case was registered against the protesters for violating the norms under which permission for the demonstration was granted. Later, though the police released the protesters, they refused to budge from the police camp for a few hours.

Around 400 teachers belonging to 32 aided schools have been on protest for the past three weeks demanding pay and pension pending for 11 months. The release of arrears has been caught up in red tape following difference in opinion between the Government and the Raj Nivas. While the government has sought to release at least a part of the arrears, the Raj Nivas has opted to withhold the payment until some of the school managements remitted their dues to the State coffers.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/a6sjmf/article32948137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THRAJNIVAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/protesting-teachers-held-while-marching-to-raj-nivas/article32948138.ece

375,2020/10/27,Union Territory registers 144 new cases but no deaths,"Lt. Governor Bedi chairs review meeting, says people are reluctant to get tested

No COVID-19 deaths were reported in Puducherry on Monday while 144 new cases were detected from 1,059 tests.

Of the new cases, 127 were reported in Puducherry, two in Karaikal, five in Yanam and 10 in Mahe.

The test positivity rate was 13.59%, case fatality rate 1.71% and recovery rate stood at 87.34%.

In the last 24 hours, 189 patients recovered and were discharged.

The overall tally in the Union Territory stands at 588 deaths, 3,758 active cases, a cumulative total of 34,336 cases and 29,990 recovered patients.

Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao said health teams of ASHA workers and ANMs had been visiting patients who had recovered from infection to check their health status. “Once the findings are consolidated, we will frame a treatment strategy for those with long-term effects,” he said.

The Minister said following decline in the caseload, instructions had been issued to stop referring COVID-19 patients to private medical colleges as a large number of beds and manpower at IGMCRI and Jipmer remained unutilised. The beds in the private sector can be earmarked as reserve capacity should there be a resurgence in the pandemic, he said.

Cross 3-lakh

The Union Territory, which had so far tested about 2,92,567 samples to date, would cross the 3-lakh mark shortly and attain a milestone of reaching 20 per cent of the population, the Minister said.

Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi called for better measures to encourage voluntary testing by the public.

Chairing a review, Ms. Bedi noted that while things seem to be coming under good control, it is being reported that people are reluctant to be tested.

“This needs better messaging to people to make them understand the purpose of testing, as it helps in early identification of the extent of prevailing infection,” she said.

She called for IEC campaigns to focus on creating better understanding among the public and possibly use music for higher appeal.

376,2020/10/27,Assembly ruckus | High Court refuses to stay summons issued to Jayarajan and Jaleel,"The Ministers were asked to appear before the court on October 28.

The Kerala High Court on Tuesday declined to stay the summons issued by the Thiruvananthapuram Chief Judicial Magistrate Court directing Ministers E.P Jayarajan and K.T. Jaleel to appear before it on October 28 in a criminal case registered in connection with the ruckus that took place in the State Assembly in March 2015.

When a petition challenging the magistrate court order dismissing the plea of the prosecution to withdraw the case registered against the Ministers and other CPI(M) leaders came up, the government counsel sought to stay the summons issued to the Ministers for their appearance on October 28. In fact, other CPI(M) leaders V Sivankutty, Kunjahammad, C.K. Sadasivan and K Ajith had appeared earlier before the trial court and taken bail in the case.

The Assembly had witnessed unprecedented scenes on March 13, 2015, as the then Opposition LDF members tried to prevent the then Finance Minister, K M Mani, who was facing charges in the bar bribery case, from presenting the State budget.

Besides flinging the Speaker's chair from the podium, electronic equipments such as computers, keyboard and microhpnes on the desk of the Speaker were allegedly damaged by LDF members.

Following the bedlam, a case was registered during the previous UDF government’s regime charging the six Opposition LDF MLAs with offences under the Prevention of Destruction of Public Property Act and IPC sections 447 (criminal trespass) and 427 (mischief causing damage). The case was based on a complaint filed by the Assembly Secretary.

The LDF government decided to withdraw the case after considering a petition by V Sivankutty, CPI(M) leader and former MLA who was among the accused in the case.

Dismissing the prosecution application seeking to withdraw the cases, the magistrate court had observed that the withdrawal of such cases would send a wrong message to society. It also added that the application seeking to withdraw the case was filed without good faith and on extraneous considerations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/g3hyh4/article31847001.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tvsrp07--JayaG517GONU83jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/assembly-ruckus-high-court-refuses-to-stay-summons-issued-to-jayarajan-and-jaleel/article32953470.ece
377,2020/10/27,Kerala reporting all COVID deaths: CM,"‘No need to fudge mortality data’

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday claimed that the State government was reporting all COVID-19 deaths in the State “responsibly” and “without fail.”

He claimed that the government did not need to fudge the State’s mortality data because even if all the “suspicious COVID-19 deaths” were included on the official list of COVID-19 deaths after a death audit, Kerala’s case fatality rate would still be lower in comparison to other States.

He claimed that earlier in 2018, when dengue cases were audited, in the initial phase only less than 40 deaths had been reported. But after auditing, even when the number of deaths turned out to be much more, the government published the report.

Kerala had been approaching COVID-19 containment in a very scientific manner and strategies were being revised in tune with the evolving epidemic.

378,2020/10/27,Roma draws level despite Ibrahimovic heroics,"Kane-Son combine works its magic again for Spurs

Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice but AC Milan dropped its first points of the Serie A season as Roma came from behind to draw 3-3 at the San Siro on Monday.

In a game played in an empty stadium after the imposition of a coronavirus curfew, Milan was without goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and young Norwegian striker Jens Petter Hauge, who the club announced earlier on Monday had tested positive for COVID-19.

Veteran Romanian goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who joined Milan in September, made his debut in place of Donnarumma, and was twice caught on his line from corners and also spilled a shot in the build up to Roma’s second-half penalty.

Diagonal pass

Ibrahimovic struck after just two minutes, running onto a diagonal pass behind the defence from Rafael Leao and poking the ball past goalkeeper Antonio Mirante.

Ibrahimovic completed his third double in three league appearances with a penalty after 78 minutes, but had an unwitting assist as Roma levelled for a third time.

Milan, with 13 points, remains at the top of the standings, two points ahead of Napoli, which has won all four games it has played, and Sassuolo. Roma remains ninth.

Lacklustre show

Son Heung-min pounced to steal a 1-0 win for lacklustre Tottenham on Monday, linking up with Harry Kane yet again as Jose Mourinho’s side climbed to fifth in the Premier League table.

The early weeks of the season have seen a string of unusual results and an off-colour Spurs looked likely to leave Turf Moor frustrated.

But South Korea forward Son scored his eighth league goal of the season in the 76th minute, heading in from close range after a headed pass from Kane.

Tottenham again struggled to find its fluency in the early stages of the second half, with Burnley threatening to take the lead.

James Tarkowski put a header wide from close range before Mourinho threw on Erik Lamela to replace Lucas Moura in the 57th minute.

Kane came to the rescue from another Tarkowski effort, heading off the line.

Tottenham was in front in the 76th minute when Lamela’s corner was flicked on by Kane and headed into the top corner at the back post by Son.

The results: Premier League: Brighton 1 (Livermore 40-og) drew with West Brom 1 (Grant 83); Burnley 0 lost to Tottenham 1 (Son 76).

Serie A: AC Milan 3 (Ibrahimovic 2, 79-pen, Saelemaekers 47) drew with Roma 3 (Dzeko 14, Veretout 71-pen, Kumbulla 84).

Bundesliga: Bayer Leverkusen 3 (Alario 16-pen, 74, Diaby 90+4) bt Augsburg 1 (D. Caligiuri 51).

379,2020/10/27,Premier League | Son strikes again as Spurs beat Burnley to move fifth,"The South Korean was left unmarked at the back post to nod home his eighth league goal of the season after Harry Kane had flicked on an Erik Lamela corner to give Mourinho's side a third win in six games.

Son Heung-min's prolific start to the season continued with his 76th minute header giving Tottenham Hotspur a 1-0 win at winless Burnley in the Premier League on Monday and moving Jose Mourinho's side up to fifth.

The South Korean was left unmarked at the back post to nod home his eighth league goal of the season after Harry Kane had flicked on an Erik Lamela corner to give Mourinho's side a third win in six games.

Kane had saved Spurs minutes earlier with a fine piece of defending as he cleared a goal-bound James Tarkowski header off the line.

Although Spurs always looked more comfortable on the ball it was Sean Dyche's side, who have just a point from their opening five games, who had come the closest.

Ashley Barnes had a 20th minute drive ruled out for offside and then Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris got down well to stop a low drive from Ashley Westwood.

Son is now the top scorer in the Premier League and Kane is becoming a leading creator with the assist his eighth of the campaign so far.

Mourinho's approach of asking Kane to play in a deeper role, often operating just behind Son and Lucas Moura, has produced the most potent attack in the league with 16 goals in six games.

“It is great, we need everyone to be scoring and assisting at the top end of the pitch. Me and Sonny have had a nice little partnership going recently and hopefully it continues,” said Kane.

“Even today it was not an amazing assist but it fell well for Sonny and 1-0 away to Burnley is a fantastic result,” he added.

Kane said the win, at a venue where they were defeated last season, was a sign of real progress for Tottenham.

“It was a massive game today, it is not an easy place to come. It is going to be a tough game, a big battle and these are the games you need three points if you are going to be up there at the end of the season. Massive fight from the lads,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/dqzgf4/article32949268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXBRITAINSOCCERPREMIERLEAGUE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/premier-league-son-strikes-again-as-spurs-beat-burnley-to-move-fifth/article32949269.ece

N. Murugan, prime accused in the Lalithaa Jewellery heist in Tiruchi and in the Punjab National Bank’s Bikshandarkoil branch burglary at Kollidam, died in a Bengaluru hospital on Monday.

Police sources in Tiruchi said Murugan, 45, had been lodged in the Bengaluru jail in connection with a case filed against him there. Murugan was undergoing treatment for various ailments at the Bowring and Lady Curzon hospital, where he died, the sources said.

384,2020/10/27,Flyover: Tiruchi Corporation issues NOC forland exchange,"Project has been in limbo for three years

Tiruchi Corporation has issued no-objection certificate (NOC) for transfer of a piece of land owned by Tamil Nadu Special Police (TSP) Battalion at Mannarpuram to the Defence Ministry in exchange of land of equal value owned by the Ministry at the location for completion of flyover near Tiruchi railway junction.

A resolution was passed at a special meeting chaired by Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian recently.

Although the civic body has no ownership right on the TSP battalion grounds, it is said that the civic body has had to issue a certificate so as to declare that it has no plan for any scheme on any government-controlled land if it is required to be transferred to other departments. To meet the requirement, the corporation has issued the certificate. It stated that the Corporation has no pending proposal for using the TSP battalion grounds for any civic infrastructure project.

Collector S. Sivarasu told The Hindu that he had received the resolution and it had been forwarded to the State Highways Department for offering land of equal value from the adjacent Tamil Nadu Special Police battalion grounds to the Defence Ministry for completing the road overbridge.

“The proposal is on the right track. We have expedited our efforts to get about 65 cents of land to resume construction of an incomplete portion of the road over bridge project,” he said.

The move was yet another attempt to get a piece of land sought by the State Highways Department from the Defence Ministry for construction of the road overbridge near Tiruchi junction. Construction of the overbridge was suspended for nearly three years now.

Though 90% of the project has been completed, the State Highways Department can proceed further only after getting a piece of defence land.

The long distance from Mumbai to Pudukottai hardly mattered to this couple during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown, determined that they were to be with their two minor children after a gap of seven months and to take part in the birthday celebration of their six-year-old son.

R. Selvam, 41, and S. Sangeetha, 35, covered nearly 1,400 km on a two-wheeler from Mumbai to remote Pillakurichi village in Karambakudi taluk where the children stayed in their grandmother's house.

Upon accomplishment of their mission a few days ago, the joy of the couple knew no bounds. They were elated to meet their 13-year-old daughter Veni and six-year-old son Yogeshwar and to celebrate the boy's birthday on October 28.

A native of Pudukottai district, Selvam says he settled down nearly 40-years ago in Mumbai where he runs a petty shop at Sion. His wife Sangeetha hails from Pillakurichi village.

A couple of days before the lockdown was clamped on March 22, Selvam brought his children to his mother-in-law's house at Pillakurichi as the school they were studying in Mumbai was closed.

“We took the children to Pillakurichi so that they could learn about the culture and rural life in Pudukottai district unaware of the commencement of the lockdown in only a matter of days from then,” says Mr. Selvam.

After leaving behind his two children, Selvam immediately returned to Mumbai after which the lockdown was clamped with complete suspension of train and flight services. For the past seven months, the children have been staying with their grandmother.

“We began to miss our children and decided to take part in the birthday celebration of Yogeswar as we never missed him on his birthday all these years,” said Mr. Selvam.

With no train service to Tamil Nadu from Mumbai and flight charges being costly, the couple decided to leave for Pudukottai district from Mumbai on their two-wheeler.

Selvam and his wife left Sion on October 20 evening and made night halts in lodges at Kolhapur in Maharashtra and at Neelamangalam in Karnataka during their journey covering 1,400 km. “We stayed put in lodges during the two night halts and filled fuel at the petrol stations situated along Maharastra - Bengaluru highway.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/oy9e2d/article32958071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY28-SCOOTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/mumbai-couples-1400-km-odyssey-on-two-wheeler/article32958072.ece

390,2020/10/27,Ghat road to Viralimalai temple to be ready by March,"The project is being executed at a cost of ₹3.8 crore.

Construction of a ghat road to Subramanya Swami Temple situated atop a hillock at Viralimalai in Pudukottai district is in full swing.

The State Highways Department (Construction and Maintenance) of Pudukottai division is executing the project at a cost of ₹3.8 crore with funds provided by the Tourism, Culture and Religious Endowments Department.

According to a senior official of the Highways Department, construction of a concrete retaining wall to a length of 360 metres from the base to the top is nearing completion. Simultaneously, earth work for laying the road is also underway. The two-lane ghat road will be laid to a length of 360 metres with paved shoulder to a width of one metre on either side.

The project envisages creation of a parking lot atop the hillock. Construction of a retaining wall surrounding the parking lot is also underway. The parking area measuring a little over 300 sq m is coming up near Idumbar temple. Street lights will be installed along the ghat road. Also, there will be concrete drains on the hill side to prevent stagnation of water, the official said.

The highlight of the project is provision of lift facility from the parking lot to the shrine. The lift is being provided especially for the benefit of elders and physically challenged devotees visiting the temple situated along Tiruchi-Madurai National Highway.

The entire project is expected to be completed before March ahead of Thai Poosam, Vaikasi Visakam, Arunagirinathaar Thiruvizha, Panguni Uthiram, Kanda Sashti and Thirukarthigai festivals.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/yxzyr7/article32956924.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY28-VIRALIMALAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/ghat-road-to-viralimalai-temple-to-be-ready-by-march/article32956925.ece
391,2020/10/27,ASI restriction on public access to thandava madi questioned,"Murals and stone sculptures adorn the circular pathway

The Archaeological Survey of India’s restriction on public access to thandava madi (upper deck) of the Big Temple in Thanjavur under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act has annoyed social activists and the general public.

The thandava madi is a small pathway located above the sanctum sanctorum of the temple, which has double walls — inner and outer — capped by a single summit. Murals adorn the inner side of the outer wall. The inner wall too sports some murals and an array of stone sculptures in bharatanatyam postures.

There are openings at the centre of all four inner walls through which one can enter the cement flooring, presumably put up by ASI above the giant granite idol of Brahadeeswarar in the sanctum sanctorum, to have a glimpse of the corbelling technique adopted in the construction of the 60-foot tower.

Though devotees and the general public have been allowed to visit the temple as far as the sanctum sanctorum, access to thandava madi, which has mural paintings of the Chola and Nayak periods, has been denied. Further, access to a similar cirumambulatory pathway around the sanctum sanctorum has also been denied.

When social activist and advocate V. Jeevakumar sent a written petition to ASI seeking access to thandava madi recently, the Department turned down his request stating that his plea could not be considered as per the provisions of the AMASR Act and Rules and as per the policy of the department keeping in view the safety of the paintings.

It further advised the petitioner to visit the replica of the paintings displayed at the interpretation centre located on the southern side of the temple.

In the present technological era, restriction on public access to art works depicting the skills of the forefathers of the land is unacceptable, he says.

“One wonders if the ASI, which claims credit for maintaining monuments by adopting the latest techniques, cannot think of making arrangements at thandava madi to safeguard the murals and sculptures from desecration by devotees and visitors by erecting fiber glass enclosures along the circumambulatory path,” he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/asi-restriction-on-public-access-to-thandava-madi-questioned/article32956317.ece
392,2020/10/27,Garbage blights Tiruchi roads,"Sanitary workers had a tough time clearing mounds of garbage on Satharaveedhi in Srirangam

Ayudha Puja festival celebration on Sunday generated heaps of garbage on streets and commercial thoroughfares in different parts of the city.

Though the usual fanfare attached to the festival was missing this year due to COVID pandemic fear, and the social distancing norms in place, most of the people including traders, two-wheeler and four wheeler mechanics, bus, taxi and auto rickshaw operators and others chose to perform no-frills pujas

Associations of various workers, traders, drivers, taxi owners, auto rickshaw operators, merchants usually come together to celebrate the festival by erecting pandals, decorating their business establishments with sparkling lights and playing music with loud speakers. But, it was hardly noticed in the city this year. However, they did not fail to clean up their premises as per the practice. They removed the unwanted items and dumped them on the streets.

According to sources in the Tiruchi Corporation, no sanitary worker, except those on medical emergencies and other pressing situations, was allowed to avail leave on Monday. However, despite their full attendance, garbage heaps were quite visible in several parts of the city.

Discarded and unsold plantain, mango leaves, and pumpkins were found heaped on the roadsides. The seasonal traders and farmers, who set up shops along the roadsides in the thickly populated areas including Woraiyur, Thennur, Thillai Nagar, Srirangam, Palakarai and East Boulevard Road left after abandoning the unsold leaves and banana plantain. They left huge garbage on college road near Chathiram Bus Stand and the other temporary markets including at Anna Nagar and others. Garbage were piled up in Singarathope, NSB Road, Big Bazaar Street, Chinnakadai Street, Nandi Koil Street, Bheema Nagar and many other locations.

Sanitary workers experienced a tough time to clear mounds of garbage on Satharaveedhi in Srirangam, one of the largest flower market in Tiruchi. The traders and workers, who worked overtime for the last two days to cash in on the demand of flowers on account of Ayudha Puja and Saraswathi Puja, had left behind a huge volume of waste.

In some places, volunteers of Shine Treechy and the traffic policemen of Cantonment and Ariyamangalam went on a mission to clear pumpkins and coconuts broken by traders in front of their commercial establishments on Sunday night. Manoj Dharmar, founder of Shine Treechy, said that besides clearing pumpkins and coconuts, they created awareness among the people on avoiding the practice by highlighting the danger posed to the motorists.

A senior official of the Corporation told The Hindu that the festivities had added about 50 tonnes of garbage to the daily collection of about 450 tonnes. Most of the garbage had been removed. Uncleared garbage would be removed on Tuesday, the official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/c51120/article32949565.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY27GARBAGETRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/post-puja-garbage-is-back/article32949566.ece

396,2020/10/27,Restrictions on large gatherings make Dasara a low-key affair,"Textile and automobile showrooms do brisk business

The Dasara festival was a low key affair this year due to the restrictions imposed on large gatherings. There were hardly any puja pandals in the city unlike scores of them, which spring up at all major junctions in the city during normal times.

A majority of the citizens remained confined to their homes. ‘Bommala Koluvu’, the arrangement of dolls in a step-like pattern, was organised by some families at their homes.

A beautiful ‘Bommala Koluvu’ arranged by Bhagyalakshmi, a classical singer, with the support of her husband P.B. Govinda Kumar, Deputy General Manager, NTPC, Parawada township, and her daughter Vaishnavi, won the appreciation of the residents of Deepanjali township of NTPC.

Consumer durable shops, textile and automobile showrooms did brisk business during the Navaratri festival.

Automobile dealers said they were unable to meet the demand from consumers in view of the shortage of supply due to the lockdown.

Wine shops, meat and chicken stalls did roaring business on Sunday.

“There was a temporary lull in sales after the lockdown was lifted. Subsequently, the demand picked up gradually. The festive season has seen a surge in demand for new cars with many people shunning public transport in view of the pandemic situation. We have seen very good demand this season but it would have been much higher, if we had more stock,” says Sunny of Jayabheri Maruti.

Pandemic situation

He estimates that the sales of cars of all brands in Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts this month at 3,500 as against the normal sales of 2,000 a month.

If there were adequate supplies, the sales would have gone up to 4,500 this month, he says.

398,2020/10/27,"2 from Punjab, Kerala held for ‘stealing cash’ from ATM","‘Accused committed offences in Hyderabad and Bengaluru’

The city police on Monday arrested two persons on the charges of robbing ₹9.59 lakh cash from an ATM in Sundarnagar in the city.

The arrested have been identified as Samarjot Singh (32), a native of Punjab, and Jafer Sadik (28), a native of Kerala. Both are reported to be habitual offenders and had become friends in a prison.

DCP (Crimes) V. Suresh Babu said that the duo came to the city on October 16 from Bengaluru in a flight and stayed in a hotel with the plan to loot cash from ATMs. The duo reportedly hired a two-wheeler to conduct recee in the city to identify potential ATMs to commit the crime.

Using the gas cutter and other equipment, the duo allegedly cut open the safe of the SBI ATM and stole the cash in the early hours on October 21 and left for Bengaluru on October 22. The duo was caught by police in Bengaluru.

Mr. Suresh Babu said that they had recovered ₹1.32 lakh cash, mobile phones and other goods worth ₹2.10 lakh from the duo.

The duo had earlier committed offences at an ATM in Hyderabad where they robbed about ₹16 lakh and in Bengaluru to the tune of ₹8 to ₹10 lakh.

According to the DCP, the duo were habituated to flamboyant lifestyle and the recovered goods include a leather waist belt that cost around ₹10,000, one shoe around ₹23,000 and one jogging suit that cost around ₹8,000.

It is learnt that about ₹3 lakh was transferred to the account of Samarjot’s brother and the cash has been frozen by the bank, on request from the city police.

The case was cracked within 35 hours, despite the accused being from out of the State and fleeing the city within 24 hours of committing the offence.

According to the Mr. Suresh Babu, evidences gathered from the spot and some CC TV footages, helped them solve the case.

On the date of the offence, the police had come to know that the offence was carried out by an outstation gang and modus operandi matched with the offences carried out in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. This was confirmed from CC TV footages at the airport.

Special teams

Commissioner of Police Manish Kumar Sinha formed special teams and one team was sent to Bengaluru.

399,2020/10/27,"Plans afoot to give Maddilapalem, Dwaraka bus stations a facelift","‘Proposal to build multiplexes and provide amenities to commuters’

The Dwaraka Bus Station (DBS), popularly known as RTC complex, and the Maddilapalem bus complex of APSRTC will soon get a facelift, if the plans of the corporation are any indication.

The RTC complex is the busy hub of the city, with buses moving in and out of the vast bus station-cum-shopping complex right from the early hours of the day to late in the night. The Main Road, going towards LIC Junction, is chock-a-block which traffic, as whenever buses try to make their way into the complex, the vehicles going behind are held up till the buses enter into the premises.

“Our idea is to develop it into an integrated bus station-cum-commercial complex. The plan is to develop multiplexes and modern passenger amenities,” says Regional Manager M.Y. Danam.

“The Sulabh complex close to the entry gate and the old cycle parking stand will be removed to provide a wide parking area. Though there are three roads leading into the complex, one beside the other, the entry is haphazard. We will widen the entry and allot the three entry points, exclusively for city and rural buses and the third for vehicles coming for parking,” Executive Engineer (DBS) K. Venkata Raju told The Hindu, when contacted.

The Maddilapalem bus complex and one of the two RTC Depots, adjacent to it, would be removed and a multi-storeyed bus station-cum-commercial complex will be constructed. The project has been given to a consultant.

This bus station and depot are located in a prime area in the city just beside the National Highway.

A plan was made to develop this bus station into a multi-storeyed bus station-cum-commercial complex with multiplexes and modern amenities, a few years ago, but the plan failed to take off.

Now, this is one of the six projects in the State, proposed by the government, for development under BOT (Build, Operate and Transfer).

The Maddilapalem Bus Station Complex will have 30 platforms and the DBS Complex will also have about the same number of platforms.

With Visakhapatnam poised to become the Executive capital of the State, a huge growth in population and traffic is anticipated and these two main city bus stations can meet the growing needs to a large extent. The MVP Colony Bus Station, Madhurawada, Simhachalam, Kurmannapalem and other bus stations can be developed, based on future needs of the growing city.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/6wfmqv/article32948049.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27-VZ-DWARAKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/plans-afoot-to-give-maddilapalem-dwaraka-bus-stations-a-facelift/article32948050.ece
400,2020/10/27,Degrees of darkness: Review of Kiley Reid’s ‘Such a Fun Age’ by Geeta Doctor,"Race, rage and retribution fuel this Booker longlisted novel, which also manages to be a fun read, as promised by the title

The one word that is trending on the political road map during these days leading up to the American elections is Race. To that you could add Rage. And if you are as finely tuned as Emira, the black American babysitter working for the Chamberlains — an aspirational white family from Philadelphia, the “Fourth most segregated of the big cities in the USA” — you might include Retribution.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

This does not mean that Kiley Reid’s debut novel, longlisted for the 2020 Booker, is not a fun read. Reid tosses the reader so expertly on the trampoline of race relations in Philadelphia, you don’t know if you are bouncing on the elasticity of her words or being pulled down by the gravity of the situation.

When you first meet Alix Chamberlain, the impeccably coiffed wife and mother who is confident enough to breastfeed her first child while sitting on the dais of a New York auditorium as speaker, you imagine her as auditioning for a role in Desperate Housewives. She has three friends who are similarly wired socially: they could be described as the chorus in a Greek drama. Emira has her own back-up of three buddies. The characters are straight out of an American sitcom.

One of Alix’s friends, Tamra, is black. As an empowered woman (Tamra is the head of an important educational institution in New York), she would fit into the category of “Third Race”, a phrase describing the Americans who with their professional degrees and wealth fall out of the

binaries of white and black. For those not as attuned to the degrees of darkness, or whiteness, Reid includes other markers such as the texture and springiness of hair, and most importantly, smell. Tamra’s girls have “inch long black afros”. Somewhere along the way you learn that Emira has to pay more for a bikini wax because of her skin type. When Alix returns to her Philadelphia home after five days in New York, her hair is blow-dried in such a bouncy manner as to immediately entice her husband, Peter.

Alix’s three friends are available at the other end of a text message in case of every emergency. And there are several in her life. These include a shift to Philadelphia from New York while she has her second child. Then there are birthday and Halloween parties to be organised. There is also retribution. It comes in the form of a boyfriend from her college days. Back then, Alix, the richest girl in class, had entrusted the poor mutt with the task of taking care of her virgin status. Here there are shades of Marjorie Morningstar, the 1955 novel by Herman Wouk, which dealt with similar problems but with less disastrous results.

Returning from New York with a chance of helping in the Hillary Clinton campaign, Alix needs Emira to work full time as babysitter. Emira, a first-time graduate in her family, has higher aspirations. But remember she’s black. The first time Alix hugs her (insincerely, of course), she registers among other things the scent of cheap perfume. Emira has forged a bond with the older child, Briar, a lexically precocious two-year old. We long for Emira to morph into that other classic American urban horror, the psychopathic babysitter. Instead, she loves Briar unconditionally.

Emira is too caught up in her predicament to be able to say what Barack Obama writes in his 1995 memoir, Dreams From My Father: “I learned to slip back and forth between my black and white worlds, understanding that each possessed its own language and customs and structures of meaning, convinced that with a bit of translation on my part the two worlds would eventually cohere.”

For all that she goes through, Emira does eventually choose between her two worlds. In that choice Kiley Reid might be signalling the audacity of hope.

401,2020/10/27,"Mission ISRO, Happiness Lab and more: Our favourite podcasts of 2020","Podcasts that discuss earthly matters and beyond

Suggesting you podcasts, week after week since the lockdown began, has been fun. For we got a chance to listen to a lot of fantastic episodes from podcasts we mightn’t have discovered otherwise. We hope you have found this column helpful too. This is going to be its last listicle. So, we bring you four of our favourite podcasts from our recommendations.

Mission ISRO

The podcast starts with this whistle-worthy dialogue:-

“Upar se Bharat kaisa dikta hain aapko? [How does India look from above?]” Prime Minister Indira Gandhi asks squadron leader Rakesh Sharma.

The squadron leader — the first person from his country to be in outer space — replies, quoting poet Muhammad Iqbal, “Saare jahaan se achcha! [Better than the whole world!]”.

This well-research podcast, featuring the delightful narration of Harsha Bhogle, tells us the story of how (and why) a fledgling nation, which was even struggling to feed its people, managed to kickstart a space mission. This is our must-listen recommendation for this year.

Episode length: 40 minutes (on average) Available on: Exclusively on Spotify

The Happiness Lab

Psychology and the Good Life, taught by Laurie Santos, is the most popular class in over three centuries of Yale University. Laurie, when she started the course, didn’t expect this overwhelming interest in the subject. The Happiness Lab is a way of taking the subject to people outside Yale. It’s a much-needed podcast for these times. It reveals the misconceptions about happiness and talks about habits that would help you increase your well-being. If you like the podcast, you can enrol for her Yale University course, which is now available for free on the online learning platform Coursera.

Episode length: 30 minutes (on average) Available on: Google podcast, Apple podcast, happinesslab.fm and more

Philosophize This!

Stephen West’s podcast discusses the thinkers and their ideas that shaped our world. His podcast won’t be enough if you are looking to get a PhD on the works of Plato. But this podcast will introduce you to different schools of philosophy across the world. It is ideal, albeit not necessary, to start listening from the first episode as West covers philosophers through the ages — from the shabbily clothed Socrates, who roamed the streets of ancient Greece to the more fashionable 20th-century American philosopher Robert Nozick and others.

402,2020/10/27,Norris apologises to Hamilton,"Lando Norris apologised to Lewis Hamilton on Tuesday after downplaying the six-time Formula One world champion’s record-breaking victory at last weekend’s Portuguese Grand Prix.

Hamilton surpassed Michael Schumacher’s feat of 91 race wins after triumphing at Portimao on Sunday.

Not impressed

But rival British F1 driver Norris did not appear overly impressed, suggesting the 35-year-old Hamilton ought to win most of the time given how superior his Mercedes car is compared to the rest of the field.

McLaren’s 20-year-old, however, backtracked on Twitter saying: “I owe an apology. I’ve been stupid and careless with some things I’ve said lately in media and interviews and, and I haven’t shown the respect I should have to certain people.”

He added: “I’m not that kind of person, so I know I should apologise to them but also everyone reading / listening. Sorry.”

Speaking after Sunday’s race, Norris was quoted by RaceFans as saying of Hamilton: “I’m just happy for him, nothing more.

“It doesn’t mean anything to me really. He’s in a car which should win every race, basically.

“He has to beat one or two other drivers, that’s it. Fair play to him, he’s still doing the job he has to do.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/formula-one/nsw0rp/article32957140.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28NORRIS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/formula-one/norris-apologises-to-hamilton/article32957141.ece
403,2020/10/27,No favouritism to Leclerc: Binotto,"Vettel had suggested his Ferrari teammate had been driving a faster car.

Team boss Mattia Binotto on Monday rejected mounting speculation that Ferrari is favouring Charles Leclerc over Sebastian Vettel by giving him a faster car.

The pair finished six places apart in Sunday’s Portuguese Grand Prix after which Vettel suggested that Leclerc had been driving a faster car.

Leclerc came home fourth and four-time champion Vettel 10th, a result that extended the German’s season-long run of defeats by his teammate as he seeks a dignified exit in his swansong season with the Italian team.

“The cars of Seb and Charles are identical, no doubt,” said Binotto. “I sincerely hope that Sebastian can qualify better at Imola and show more of what he is capable of during the race.

“Charles is very good, but maybe you can expect more from the second driver.”

Binotto’s cryptic comment followed an equally enigmatic explanation from Vettel for his struggle for form.

“On the one hand, I’m satisfied because I had the feeling that I drove a good race,” said Vettel.

“But, on the other hand, it’s obvious that the other car is much faster. Where do I lose time? I have been biting my tongue all year long. Some idiot might never figure it out, but am I a complete idiot? I doubt it.

“At some point, you should be lucky and hit the limit. I never hit it and, if I do, then only with a lot of difficulty. On the other side (of the garage) it looks much easier.”

A sparkling qualifying lap from Leclerc exemplified their differences as he claimed fourth on the grid and was half a second faster.

Vettel avoided making any direct accusations after the race, adding: “I have to think that we have the same car. I trust the people around me and in the garage.”

To add to Vettel’s current difficulties and much unwanted attention, he revealed also that he had sent Lewis Hamilton a pre-race text message, encouraging the six-time champion to claim a record 92nd race win.

Vettel was told before the season began that he was not being retained by Ferrari for 2021. Since then, he has agreed to join Racing Point, which will compete as Aston Martin next season.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/formula-one/7j9xgg/article32957120.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28VETTEL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/formula-one/no-favouritism-to-leclerc-binotto/article32957121.ece
404,2020/10/27,Coronavirus | No clarity yet on whether vaccine will be free for all in India,"Will depend on specific candidate, dosage, says NITI Aayog’s V.K. Paul

There is no clarity on whether a COVID-19 vaccine, whenever it is ready, will be free of cost for everyone in India and it being so would depend on the outcome of clinical trials underway to test the vaccine, said the head of the committee overseeing vaccine development as well as planning its distribution.

Also read: Coronavirus | Hopes rise for Oxford vaccine

“We'll have more clarity in the weeks ahead when trial data from the ongoing trials (phase 3) of the Serum Institute of India (which is testing the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine) is available. The success of it and the other candidates will determine the availability and the dosage required and then we can discuss financing. The next three weeks will yield clarity on this,” said Dr. V.K. Paul of the NITI Aayog, who heads the Centre’s expert committee on vaccines. He was speaking on the sidelines of a press briefing on Tuesday.

At the briefing, in response to a question from The Hindu, Dr. Paul said that “for the foreseeable future” it looked like “resources wouldn't be a problem” in making vaccines available for free.

“Consultations are on; we are drawing up blueprints in trying to work this out. We have requested States to keep the national interest in mind in questions of vaccine prioritisation and availability,” he said.

Also read: Coronavirus | Trials of a dozen vaccines progressing, says Gagandeep Kang

Last week, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said, when ready, the vaccine would be administered free to everyone in the State. The BJP’s poll manifesto in Bihar promised a free vaccine to residents. Union Minister Pratap Sarangi said in Bhubaneshwar that a vaccine would be free across the board.

Though the government provides several vaccines free to children and pregnant women under its National Immunisation Programme, the sheer scale of the pandemic and complex international financial agreements undergirding vaccine development and deployment, mean that there's uncertainty on the actual costs to the Centre.

The Gavi Covax Advance Market Commitment scheme, involving nearly 180 countries, is a mechanism to ensure that a vaccine, whenever ready, is equitably available globally. The scheme requires $2 billion to be able to ready 2 billion doses by 2021 and so far commitments by countries total nearly $1 billion to ensure access to high risk vulnerable groups. India’s financial commitment to this scheme is as yet unclear. This is separate from bilateral deals that countries have entered into to ensure access to their citizens.

Government officials have previously indicated that while the vaccine would be free for the poor, it could also retail at as much as ₹120-140.

A person, who's involved in screening potential vaccine candidates for the Department of Biotechnology, said on condition of anonymity that there are tremendous costs with actually administering vaccine to a person.

“The cost of administering a vaccine could be as much as the vaccine itself. This is a viral vaccine and culturing them is harder and costlier than bacterial vaccines. Also this has to be injected 30 days apart, which is much more expensive than say, the oral polio vaccine. There is a significant cost and somebody has to pay,” the scientist said.

Comment | More than a vaccine, it is about vaccination

Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech Limited, and ZyCovD by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadilla are two other vaccine candidates being tested in India that are in phase-2 trials, or the step before large phase-3 trials. While the AstraZeneca vaccine is being tested in India, Serum Institute has so far only committed 200 milion doses for India and 92 other low and middle income countries. The actual doses to be made available for India is uncertain.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/um7ncs/article31494185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VKPAUL,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-no-clarity-yet-on-whether-vaccine-will-be-free-for-all-in-india/article32957849.ece
405,2020/10/27,How this NGO is breaking taboos around menstrual hygiene in rural Andhra Pradesh,"Hyderabad-based Balamitra Foundation’s project of distributing menstrual hygiene kits in Andhra’s Billalavalasa village has started conversations on a topic often brushed under the carpet

When Sravani got her first period, she had no idea how to manage the bleeding since nobody had spoken about it to her. Even her mother was hush-hush about it. She ended up using cloth and missing a week’s class at school. Several girls like her in Billalavalasa village in Vizianagaram district, Andhra Pradesh, would miss school for a week every month, some even dropping out once they attained puberty.

Last year, the girls saw a ray of hope when Balamitra Foundation launched a crowd-funded project to distribute menstrual hygiene kits among girls of Classes VIII to X at the ZP High School (ZPHS), Billalavalasa. Around 150 sets were distributed by the Hyderabad-based NGO.

Stigma around menstruation is one of the biggest challenges faced by social organisations aiming to empower women in rural Andhra Pradesh. “When we approached the school, we realised that there were high numbers of absentees among girl students in higher grades, which eventually led to dropouts. We wanted to eradicate the taboo about menstrual hygiene by talking to the parents and counselling them,” says Chandrika Kanumuri, managing trustee, Balamitra Foundation.

“Our objective is to bring about empathy and empowerment in young India. This year, for the menstrual hygiene kit project, two volunteers from Visakhapatnam are leading the way in raising awareness for crowd-funding,” says Chandrika.

As part of the project, Balamitra Foundation’s Run For A Better Future 5K run was conducted in Hyderabad last year. The money raised was used to put together 150 menstrual hygiene kits. Each kit contains 100 sanitary pads, newspaper strips for disposal, two pairs of underwear, soap strips for handwashing, a pouch to carry napkins to school, and a pamphlet with information on maintaining menstrual hygiene.

The NGO procured bio-degradable sanitary pads from Hyderabad-based Mahina Napkins and Visakhapatnam-based women-led organisation, Sampoorna. These pads are made from wood pulp, gel sheets, woven fabric and paper.

“Menstrual hygiene practices are structured by cultural norms, economic status and socio-economic pressures in rural belts. We realised that making sanitary pads accessible was just one part of this issue. Creating a change in mindset was the main challenge. We hence visited the school with psychologists and counselled parents,” says Chandrika.

The crowdfunding for the project, during its second year, is already underway. “This year, due to the pandemic, we conducted a virtual run from October 19 to 24 to raise funds. We are also working with Bengaluru-based Fuel a Dream, a crowdfunding platform in which individuals can donate funds,” she adds.

The school staff of ZPHS in Billalavalasa are hopeful that this is a beginning that will bring positive behavioural change among the girls.“The distribution of menstrual hygiene kits has helped our high school girls immensely in knowing proper methods of usage and disposal. And more importantly, it has helped in addressing the taboo associated with menstruation,” says G Sanjeeva Rao, Headmaster ZPHS Billalavalasa. Balamitra Foundation engages with teachers, community members as well as students, and they ensure they involve fathers of the girls as well in conversations about menstrual health.

Similar initiatives have been undertaken by the NGO in Telangana in the villages of Ippalavalasa, Bhagiradhipuram, Kondalaveru, Korlam, Badam, Kunchigumadam and Siriyalapeta, reaching out to more than 700 beneficiaries including children studying in 10 government schools. “We support these schools by providing sports equipment, reading and art material, scholarships and menstrual hygiene kits for high school girls,” says Chandrika.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/rblolf/article32955334.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/balamitra,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/how-this-ngo-is-breaking-taboos-around-menstrual-hygiene-in-rural-andhra-pradesh/article32955316.ece
406,2020/10/27,Long-term immunity in doubt as UK study finds COVID-19 antibodies fall rapidly,"Imperial College London’s research, which tested more than 365,000 people in England, found that antibody response to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 wanes over time, which indicates that any level of immunity could last only a few months.

The hope for long-term immunity from COVID-19 was thrown into doubt on Tuesday as a large UK study concluded that protective antibodies in people fall “quite rapidly” after a coronavirus infection.

Imperial College London’s research, which tested more than 365,000 people in England, found that antibody response to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 wanes over time, which indicates that any level of immunity could last only a few months.

“Seasonal coronaviruses that circulate every winter and cause common colds can re-infect people after six to 12 months,” said professor Wendy Barclay, a virologist who was one of the researchers on the study.

“We suspect that the way the body reacts to infection with this new coronavirus is similar to that,” she said.

Antibodies are a key part of the body’s immune defences and stop viruses from getting inside the body’s cells. The Imperial College London team found the number of people testing positive with a finger-prick test for antibodies has fallen by 26% between June and September.

“Our study shows that over time there is a reduction in the proportion of people testing positive for antibodies,” said professor Paul Elliott, director of the programme at Imperial College London.

“Testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to COVID-19. It remains unclear what level of immunity antibodies provide, or for how long this immunity lasts. If someone tests positive for antibodies, they still need to follow national guidelines including social distancing measures, getting a swab test if they have symptoms and wearing face coverings where required,” he said.

Also read: 30% recovered COVID-19 patients have no antibodies: govt. survey

The downward trend was observed in all areas of England and age groups, but not in health workers, which could indicate repeated or higher initial exposure to the virus, the authors suggest.

“This very large study has shown that the proportion of people with detectable antibodies is falling over time. We don’t yet know whether this will leave these people at risk of reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-19, but it is essential that everyone continues to follow guidance to reduce the risk to themselves and others, said professor Helen Ward, one of the lead authors.

Age groups

The decline was largest in people aged 75 and above compared to younger people, and also in people with suspected rather than confirmed infection, indicating that the antibody response varies by age and with the severity of illness.

The decline was largest in people who didn’t report a history of COVID-19, dropping by almost two-thirds (64%) between rounds one and three, compared to a decrease of 22.3% in people who had an infection confirmed by lab testing.

UK Health Minister Lord Bethell said the research would help inform the government’s continued response to the disease.

“It is also important that everyone knows what this means for them - this study will help in our fight against the virus, but testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to COVID-19,” said Lord James Bethell.

“Regardless of the result of an antibody test, everyone must continue to comply with government guidelines including social distancing, self-isolating and getting a test if you have symptoms and always remember Hands, Face, Space, he said.

People in London had the highest proportion of positive tests across the country, at around twice the national average. Health and care workers, ethnic minority groups, and those living in deprived areas and large households also had the greatest burden of past infection.

The latest findings, part of the government-backed Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) studies, suggest a decline in the level of immunity in the population in the months following the first wave of the pandemic, leading to the second wave currently underway across the UK.

However, experts believe more work is still needed before any conclusive evidence on long-term immunity and also how the novel coronavirus would react to a viable vaccine that clears clinical trials to be rolled out against COVID-19. Some high-risk sections of the population may require additional follow-up booster doses to boost levels of immunity.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ppr12l/article31875552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TH-SCIANTIBODYjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/long-term-immunity-in-doubt-as-uk-study-finds-covid-19-antibodies-fall-rapidly/article32954603.ece
407,2020/10/27,Coronavirus | Types of heart damage experienced by COVID-19 patients identified,"The researchers assessed the heart scans of 305 adult patients

Scientists have identified the different types of structural injuries to the heart experienced by COVID-19 patients that are associated with life-threatening blood clots and cardiac arrest, findings that may lead to better monitoring of people vulnerable to these deadly conditions.

According to the study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, these abnormalities in the heart are associated with higher risk of death among hospitalised COVID-19 patients.

The researchers believe the new insights may help doctors better understand the mechanism of cardiac injury among those infected with the novel coronavirus, leading to quicker identification of patients at risk and guidance on future therapies.

“Early detection of structural abnormalities may dictate more appropriate treatments, including anticoagulation and other approaches for hospitalised and post-hospitalised patients,” said study co-author Valentin Fuster from The Mount Sinai Hospital.

In the current study, the scientists looked at the levels of the protein troponin, which is released when the heart muscle becomes damaged, in combination with the presence of cardiac scan abnormalities seen using an echocardiogram instrument. The researchers found that the combination was associated with worse prognosis and mortality than troponin elevations alone.

Diverse cardiac structural abnormalities

“This is one of the first studies to provide detailed echocardiographic and electrocardiographic data in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and laboratory evidence of myocardial injury,” explained study corresponding author Gennaro Giustino from The Mount Sinai Hospital. “We found that among COVID-19 patients who underwent transthoracic echocardiography, these cardiac structural abnormalities were diverse and present in nearly two-thirds of patients.”

The scientists assessed the heart scans of 305 adult patients with confirmed positive COVID-19 admitted to four New York City hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System, and two hospitals in Milan, Italy, between March and May 2020.

According to the study, the average age of the patients was 63 years and 67.2% were men.

It noted that 190 of the 305 patients had evidence of heart damage — 118 of them had heart damage at the time of hospital admission, and 72 developed cardiac injury during hospitalisation.

According to the study,

26.3% of the patients had dysfunction in the heart’s right ventricle chamber

23.7% had regional left ventricular wall motion abnormalities

18.4% had cardiac abnormalities which can be associated with inflammation of the heart and heart damage

13.2% had grade II or III diastolic dysfunction — a condition leading to stiffer cardiac chambers.

7.2% had extra fluid around the heart that causes abnormal pumping of the heart

The researchers said they adjusted for other major complications from COVID-19 including shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and renal failure.

According to the scientists, troponin elevation was 5.2% among patients who did not have heart injury, compared to 18.6% for patients with myocardial injury but without heart scan abnormalities, and 31.7% for those with heart injury that could be spotted visibly using the echocardiogram.

“Our study shows that an echocardiogram performed with appropriate personal protection considerations is a useful and important tool in early identification of patients at greater risk for COVID-19-related cardiac injury, who may benefit from a more aggressive therapeutic approach earlier in their hospitalisation,” said study co-author Martin Goldman from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the U.S. “Additionally, because this is a new disease with lingering symptoms, we plan on following these patients closely using imaging to evaluate the evolution and hopefully resolution of these cardiac issues.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/oaq6qj/article32953257.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKCZECHREPUBLIC,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/types-of-heart-damage-experienced-by-covid-19-patients-identified/article32953258.ece
408,2020/10/27,IIT-G develops low-cost tech to produce anti-ageing compounds,"Patented by a professor and a student, membrane technology uses a wide range of farm resources, including citrus fruits, berries, pulses, tea and onions

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati (IIT-G) have developed a low-cost membrane technology to produce psychoactive drugs and anti-ageing compounds from agricultural resources.

The technology, eliminating the use of any organic solvents, has been patented and developed by Mihir Kumar Purkait, professor of the Department of Chemical Engineering and head of the Centre of Environment and his M Tech student V.L. Dhadge.

According to the duo, the technology produces caffeine (psychoactive drugs) and flavonoids (anti-ageing compounds) from citrus fruits and peels, berries, ginkgo biloba, parsley, pulses, tea, sea buckthorn, onions and other farm resources.

“Commercially available techniques use costly organic solvents such as chloroform and acetone. These pharmaceutical raw materials ultimately increases the price of the antioxidant developed,” Professor Purkait said, adding that the use of organic solvents had other disadvantages.

The membrane technology used only water, thereby reducing the cost of pharmaceutical stimulants and anti-ageing compounds.

IIT-G researchers said there were very few global manufacturers who used solvent-based technology to produce costly flavonoids but with purity up to 80%. Data with the Ministry of Commerce say the global market for flavonoids is expected to increase from 347.8 metric tonnes in 2017 to 412.4 metric tonnes by 2022.

The IIT-G developers claimed the new membrane technology could help India reduce the import of flavonoids as camellia sinensis (tea), of which the country is the second largest producer on earth, is one of the key resources.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/s9l5/article25920896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IIT-G,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/iit-g-develops-low-cost-tech-to-produce-anti-ageing-compounds/article32953078.ece
409,2020/10/27,Lilly antibody drug fails in a COVID-19 study; others go on,"The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said a closer look did not verify a safety problem but found a low chance that the drug would prove helpful for hospitalised patients.

U.S. government officials are putting an early end to a study testing an Eli Lilly antibody drug for people hospitalised with COVID-19 because it doesn’t seem to be helping them.

Independent monitors had paused enrollment in the study two weeks ago because of a possible safety issue. But on Monday, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which sponsors the study, said a closer look did not verify a safety problem but found a low chance that the drug would prove helpful for hospitalised patients.

It is a setback for one of the most promising treatment approaches for COVID-19. President Donald Trump received a similar experimental, two-antibody drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. on an emergency basis when he was sickened with the coronavirus earlier this month.

In a statement Lilly notes that the government is continuing a separate study testing the antibody drug in mild to moderately ill patients, to try to prevent hospitalisation and severe illness. The company also is continuing its own studies testing the drug, which is being developed with the Canadian company AbCellera.

Antibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs; they attach to a virus and help it be eliminated. The experimental drugs are concentrated versions of one or two specific antibodies that worked best against the coronavirus in lab and animal tests.

Lilly and Regeneron have asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency use authorisation for their drugs for COVID-19 while late-stage studies continue. Lilly says its request is based on other results suggesting the drug helps patients who are not hospitalised, and that it will continue to seek the FDA’s permission for emergency use.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/qj99sx/article32950951.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAK-ANTIBODYDRUG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/lilly-antibody-drug-fails-in-a-covid-19-study-others-go-on/article32950952.ece
