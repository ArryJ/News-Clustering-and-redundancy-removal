0,2020/10/10,NBA Finals | Heat take it to Game Six,"Butler’s triple-double overshadows James’ 40-point effort

Jimmy Butler’s triple-double propelled Miami Heat to a 111-108 victory over Los Angeles Lakers on Friday. The win kept Heat alive in the best-of-seven NBA Finals, which Lakers lead 3-2.

Butler scored 35 points with 12 rebounds and 11 assists and Heat withstood a 40-point performance from Lakers superstar LeBron James. Game Six is on Sunday, and seven, if needed, will be on Tuesday.

Rare rally

Heat can become just the second team to rally from a 3-1 deficit to win the championship series. The only other team to do it was the James-led Cleveland Cavaliers against Golden State in 2016.

Butler drained two free-throws with 16.8 seconds left to put Heat up by one.

James, stymied under the basket, found Danny Green for a wide-open three-pointer with 7.1 seconds remaining but Green missed and Tyler Herro added two more free-throws to seal the game.

On a night that saw Heat lead much of the way, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope’s three-pointer with 6:18 remaining put the Lakers up 97-96.

But Heat dug in, Duncan Robinson’s three-pointer put the team ahead 101-99 with 3:16 remaining, and it was a heavyweight slugfest the rest of the way, the lead changing hands seven more times.

Robinson added 26 points for Miami. Kendrick Nunn had 14, Bam Adebayo 13, Herro 12 and Jae Crowder 11. James added 13 rebounds and seven assists for the Lakers, Anthony Davis 28 points and Caldwell-Pope 16.

Multiple triple-doubles

Butler is just the sixth player in NBA Finals history to have multiple triple-doubles in the title series, and just the second, along with James, to have multiple 30-point triple-doubles in the same Finals.

The result: Finals: Miami Heat 111 (Butler 35, Robinson 26) bt LA Lakers 108 (James 40, Davis 28) Lakers 3-2.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/2s77ak/article32822956.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11NBA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/nba-finals-heat-take-it-to-game-six/article32822957.ece
1,2020/10/10,Coronavirus | Swimming Federation launches video campaign to highlight key guidelines,"The guidelines, including regular temperature checks and sanitisation, will be posted on SFI’s social media handles and will be shared with parents and swimmers across various centres.

The Swimming Federation of India (SFI) on Saturday launched a video campaign to highlight the key guidelines of the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) issued by the Sports Ministry, ahead of the reopening of pools.

The guidelines, including regular temperature checks and sanitisation, will be posted on SFI’s social media handles and will be shared with parents and swimmers across various centres.

The National body has also communicated to all the state units to ensure implementation of the SOPs as their top priority and work with the state governments and local authorities to facilitate activities to resume on October 15 outside containment zones.

Last month, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had announced the reopening of pools used for training of sports persons across the country.

“These guidelines are sacrosanct and we have encouraged all State Units and Swimming Centres in the country who train competitive swimmers to ensure these SOPs are implemented while they plan to resume training on top priority,” SFI secretary general Monal Chokshi said.

SFI will also hold interactive online sessions led by international experts to further guide the swimmers on the important aspects to keep in mind when they return to competitive training.

“In the coming weeks, we have planned to hold virtual interactive sessions with experts who will further explain the micro-level precautions that can be followed while adhering to the guidelines issued by the Ministry,” Chokshi said.

Swimming had been hit hard by the pandemic as pools and complexes across the country remained shut ever since the lockdown was announced on March 24.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/tdefkk/article32820925.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSINDIA-CASES,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/swimming-federation-launches-video-campaign-to-highlight-key-guidelines-of-sop/article32820926.ece

3,2020/10/10,French Open | Swiatek dazzles in Paris to claim first Grand Slam title,"Swiatek produced another audacious display as she became the first Polish player to win a Grand Slam singles title.

Securing a first Grand Slam title is supposed to be an arduous task but 19-year-old Iga Swiatek crowned an extraordinary fortnight to win the French Open in a blaze of winners on Saturday, crushing Sofia Kenin 6-4 6-1.

Swiatek, who had dropped only 23 games en route to the final, produced another audacious display as she became the first Polish player to win a Grand Slam singles title.

Only briefly in the first set did Swiatek show any weakness, letting slip a 3-0 lead, but having edged a tightly-contested opening set she romped to victory, although fourth seed Kenin's challenge appeared to be hampered by a thigh injury.

Australian Open champion Kenin, herself only 21, needed treatment at 1-2 in the second set and on the resumption Swiatek was utterly ruthless, conceding only three more points, sealing the title with an unstoppable forehand, her 25th winner.

Unseeded Swiatek, who was ranked 54th at the start of the tournament, is the youngest woman to win the French Open since Monica Seles in 1992 and the first to do so without dropping a set during the fortnight since Justine Henin in 2007.

After claiming victory she made her way into the stands to celebrate with her family including former Olympic rower father Tomasz and her coach Piotr Sierzputowski.

“It was overwhelming for me. Two years ago I won a junior grand slam and now I'm here. It feels like such a short time. I'm just overwhelmed,” Swiatek, the lowest-ranked woman to win the French Open since rankings were introduced in 1975, said after returning to the court.

“Another underdog wins a Grand Slam in women's tennis, it's crazy.”

It was a sad end to the tournament for Kenin who was unable to find the form that saw her past Petra Kvitova in the semi-finals.

Swiatek began the match on the shady side of the Court Philippe Chatrier court with Kenin in bright sunshine, but it was the Pole's tennis that illuminated the 84-minute final.

She began as freely as if it was match down at her local club in Warsaw, sprinting into a 3-0 lead.

Kenin, whose tightly-wound and expressive demeanour was a stark contrast to Swiatek's calm approach, fought back to 3-3 as her backhand began to do some damage.

Swiatek came through a tense service game at 3-3 and in the best passage of play in the final then broke Kenin after another long game in which she saved a game point with a superb drop volley having chased down a drop shot.

Kenin broke serve with a glorious backhand to trail 5-4 but Swiatek was feasting on the American's serve and broke for the third time in the set to move to take the opener.

Swiatek dropped serve at the start of the second set but hit back immediately and Kenin's challenge faded rapidly after she had her left thigh heavily taped.

Logic suggests nerves might have became a factor as glory beckoned but Swiatek bashed winners all over the court to announce herself as the sport's latest sensation in style.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jqhazz/article32822736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SWIATEK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/french-open-swiatek-dazzles-in-paris-to-claim-first-grand-slam-title/article32822737.ece
4,2020/10/10,French Open | Djokovic survives Tsitsipas challenge to set up Nadal final,"Djokovic had a match point in the third set but saw the 22-year-old Tsitsipas fight back spectacularly to level the match at two sets apiece

World number one Novak Djokovic defended resolutely to outlast big-hitting Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 6-2 5-7 4-6 6-1 in an enthralling contest on Friday to advance to the final of the French Open.

The Serb will meet 12-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal, seeded second, in another mouth-watering clash on Sunday with the Spaniard also bidding to equal Roger Federer's record men's haul of 20 Grand Slam singles titles.

“Here, he (Nadal) is the favourite, it's his home here. With all the titles he's won ... but in 2015 I won here against him in the quarter-finals,” Djokovic said in his on-court interview.

“I hope I can recuperate, I need my best tennis. It's maybe the biggest challenge in our sport to play Nadal at Roland Garros. I look forward to it, I'm happy to be here and motivated to win.”

Djokovic, whose 2016 Roland Garros triumph features among his 17 major titles, had a match point in the third set but saw the 22-year-old Tsitsipas fight back spectacularly to level the match at two sets apiece.

Tsitsipas, seeded fifth, ran out of steam in the deciding set but saved another match point before the 33-year-old sealed the win with a crushing service return in three hours and 54 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.

“We have to congratulate Stefanos for this great battle. In the end he was tired obviously, it was not easy after four hours,” Djokovic said. “He's a very good player and I wish him well for his career.

“I was calm on the surface but inside it was something totally different. I thought that after losing the third set, and the fourth, I was still solid.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/rxl4o1/article32817701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NOVAKKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/french-open-djokovic-survives-tsitsipas-challenge-to-set-up-nadal-final/article32817702.ece
5,2020/10/10,Researchers use moths to airdrop sensors and measure environmental conditions,"The sensor system weighing only 98 milligram, about one tenth the weight of a jellybean, can ride aboard an insect like moth or a small drone to reach its destination.

Researchers have developed a light-weight sensor system that can be carried by small insects like a moth to destinations that are dangerous or too small for humans to reach. These sensors can be used to map out conditions like temperature and humidity in these regions.

“This is the first time anyone has shown that sensors can be released from tiny drones or insects such as moths, which can traverse through narrow spaces better than any drone and sustain much longer flights,” said Shyam Gollakota, an associate professor in University of Washington.

Researchers from the University have created the sensor system weighing only 98 milligram, about one tenth the weight of a jellybean, that can ride aboard an insect like moth or a small drone to reach its destination.

Once it reaches the destination, researchers can send a Bluetooth command to drop the sensor from its perch. The sensor is held on the insect using a magnetic pin surrounded by a thin coil of wire. As soon as a researcher sends a wireless command to release the sensor, it creates a current through the coil that makes the magnetic pin to pop out the sensor.

The sensor can fall from a maximum height of 72 feet without breaking. It is powered by a battery. On its way down, it begins rotating around the corner with the battery that slows its descent. This, combined with the sensor’s low weight, keeps the maximum fall speed at around 11 miles per hour, allowing the sensor to land safely, according to the researchers.

After landing, the sensor can collect data like temperature or humidity, for around three years.

The researchers believe that they can use this to create a network of sensors in a study area. This includes scattering sensors across a forest or farm to track them. They expect that this system can be deployed in different locations, including environmentally sensitive areas.

They are developing a mechanism to recover sensors once their batteries expire. They plan to replace the battery with a solar cell and automate sensor deployment in industrial settings.

The team was inspired by the idea of how the military drops food and essential supplies from helicopters in disaster zones. The same concept was implemented to develop this system.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/3zxjdx/article32820614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/airdroppingsensors,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/researchers-use-moths-to-airdrop-sensors-and-measure-environmental-conditions/article32820599.ece

7,2020/10/10,Taiwan President calls for ‘meaningful’ talks with China,"Tsai describes situation in the Taiwan Strait as ‘quite tense’

Taiwan wants to have “meaningful dialogue” with China on an equal basis, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Saturday, extending an olive branch at a time of heightened military tension with Beijing, which claims the island as sovereign Chinese territory.

Democratic Taiwan has come under increasing pressure from Beijing, which has ramped up Air Force activity near the island in the past few weeks, including crossing the Taiwan Strait’s sensitive mid line that normally serves as an unofficial buffer zone.

China says it is responding to “collusion” between Washington and Taipei, angered at growing U.S. support for the self-governed island. Beijing views this a precursor to Taiwan declaring formal independence, a red line for China.

Speaking at National Day celebrations, Ms. Tsai described the situation in the Taiwan Strait as “quite tense.” This, along with disputes in the South China Sea, a China-India border conflict and China’s crackdown in Hong Kong, showed democracy and peace in the region were facing big challenges, she said.

If Beijing can heed Taiwan’s voice and jointly facilitate reconciliation and peaceful dialogue, regional tension can surely be resolved, she added.

“As long as the Beijing authorities are willing to resolve antagonisms and improve cross-strait relations, while parity and dignity are maintained, we are willing to work together to facilitate meaningful dialogue,” Ms. Tsai said.

But China, which cut off a formal talks mechanism in 2016, said on Saturday that Taiwan continued to pursue independence and still held a confrontational mindset.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/luh5ms/article32823068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-TAIWANCHINANATIONALDAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taiwan-president-calls-for-meaningful-talks-with-china/article32823069.ece
8,2020/10/10,"Kyrgyzstan bans rallies, imposes curfew","Ex-President Atambayev re-arrested after he was freed by demonstrators

Authorities in Kyrgyzstan on Saturday arrested a former President, banned rallies and imposed a curfew in the Central Asian nation’s capital, seeking to end a week of turmoil sparked by a disputed parliamentary election.

The declaration of the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. curfew in Bishkek followed President Sooronbai Jeenbekov’s decree on Friday announcing a state of emergency in the city until October 21. He also ordered the military to deploy troops to the capital to enforce the measure.

Convoys of military trucks were seen driving into the city.

Mr. Jeenbekov has faced calls to step down from thousands of protesters who stormed government buildings a night after pro-government parties reportedly swept parliamentary seats in Sunday’s vote. The demonstrators also freed former President Almazbek Atambayev, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison in June on charges of corruption and abuse of office that hedescribed as a political vendetta by Jeenbekov.

Mr. Atambayev was arrested again on Saturday on charges of organising riots, the State Security Committee said in a statement.

The turmoil marks a third time in 15 years that protesters have moved to topple a government in Kyrgyzstan, a Central Asian nation of 6.5 million that is one of the poorest to emerge from the former Soviet Union.

As in the uprisings that ousted Kyrgyz presidents in 2005 and 2010, the current protests have been driven by clan rivalries that play a dominant role in the country’s politics.

Under pressure from protesters, the Central Election Commission has overturned the parliamentary vote results and protest leaders have moved quickly to form a new government. The President’s allies in Parliament on Saturday elected lawmaker Sadyr Zhaparov as new Prime Minister.

On Friday, supporters of Mr. Zhaparov assailed pro-Atambayev demonstrators on Bishkek’s central square, hurling stones and bottles. A man with a pistol fired several shots at Mr. Atambayev’s car, but the former President was unhurt. Two other politicians affiliated with Mr. Atambayev also had their cars shot at. They weren’t injured.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4r12kp/article32823024.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-KYRGYZSTANPROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kyrgyzstan-bans-rallies-imposes-curfew/article32823025.ece
9,2020/10/10,"Israel to bring over 2,000 Ethiopian Jews","13,000 reside in Addis Ababa, Gondar

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told his Ethiopian counterpart that his country has the intention to “immediately” bring over some 2,000 Ethiopian Jews. The announcement came on Friday after a phone call with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.

Mr. Netanyahu’s office said the decision comes “out of his commitment to the continued aliyah of Jews to Israel”.

Some 13,000 Ethiopian Jews are in the capital, Addis Ababa, and in Gondar, most of them waiting to be taken to Israel, which they call home. Most live in dire conditions and have threatened to stage a hunger strike if they’re not allowed to travel to their “homeland”.

“Some 250 people have left for Israel within the past year until COVID-19 came. Now the travel has stopped, but Israeli officials are conducting interviews online,” Nigusie Alemu Eyasu, programme director for the Ethiopian Jews Community, said.

Activists say Israel’s government in 2015 pledged to bring the remaining Ethiopian Jews to Israel. In 1991, while Ethiopia was in the midst of a civil war, Israel carried out the dramatic Operation Solomon, airlifting some 14,500 Ethiopian Jews in less than two days.

Jews are often referred to in Ethiopia as “Falashas,” a derogatory word which translates into “strangers” or “migrants”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israel-to-bring-over-2000-ethiopian-jews/article32823007.ece
10,2020/10/10,Louise Glück | The revenge against circumstance,"The Nobel laureate writes about life and its harshness with ‘austere beauty’

After several years of polarising the globe with its choice for the Literature Nobel, the Swedish Academy gave the 2020 Prize to contemporary American poet Louise Glück “for her unmistakable poetic voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal”. But such is the state of the world, divided over race, caste, creed, class, that Ms. Glück’s first thoughts on winning was that she was astonished. Then, which Nobel winner isn’t? Her surprise was directed elsewhere, “completely flabbergasted that they would choose a white American lyric poet,” she told The New York Times.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

And yet the 77-year-old Ms. Glück (pronounced Glick) is a celebrated poet in America. She has written 12 collections of poetry and essay volumes. Her work is often compared to poets like Emily Dickinson and Sylvia Plath. She has won all the top awards, from the Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for The Wild Iris to the National Book Award in 2014 for Faithful and Virtuous Night, and was anointed Poet Laureate in 2003. Her poems are spare. She often looks at life’s euphoria and struggles — love, loss, relationships, betrayal, death — through the prism of the past, especially the Greek myths. Ms. Glück had a difficult adolescence, often “at war with my mom” as she has said in interviews; struggled with anorexia, but even through the darkness she wanted to write. In ‘Persephone the Wanderer’ (Averno), she examines the mother-daughter relationship — “In the first version, Persephone/is taken from her mother/and the goddess of the earth/punishes the earth — this is consistent with what we know of human behaviour,/that human beings take profound satisfaction/in doing harm, particularly unconscious harm:/we may call this/negative creation.” Anders Olsson, chairman of the Nobel Committee, heard in her poetry, the voices of Dido, Persephone and Eurydice – the abandoned, the punished, the betrayed. They, he noted, were masks for a self in transformation, valid both personally and universally.

In her 2012 interview to the American Academy of Achievement, Ms. Glück said she began writing from an early age and was moved by William Blake (especially The Little Black Boy). Her first published collection was Firstborn (1968), which was acclaimed by critics. Talking about the process, Ms. Glück said she “feels alive” when she writes poetry. For her, writing is a kind of “revenge against circumstance – bad luck, loss, pain…”

Witness to intimacy

Ms. Glück has another vocation, explains Joanne Feit Diehl in her introduction to On Louise Glück: Change What you See. “She writes poems that bear witness to intimate occasions — subtle psychological moments captured by the austerity of her diction.” Like in ‘Parados’ (Poems 1962-2012): “I’ll tell you/ what I meant to be.../a device that listened…/Not inert: still./ A piece of wood. A stone….I was born to a vocation/To bear witness/To the great mysteries./Now that I have seen both/ birth and death, I know/to the dark nature these/ are proofs, not /mysteries...”

A teacher of English at Yale University, Ms. Glück has said that from poet Stanley Kunitz, she learnt to subordinate her ego to the needs of the poem. Collections like The Triumph of Achilles (1985) and Ararat (1990), where three characteristics which recur in her writing unite, were mentioned in the Nobel statement. “The topic of family life; austere intelligence; and a refined sense of composition” find echo in the poems, understandably endearing her to both readers and critics. Her new book, Winter Recipes from the Collective, is due for release next year.

Erica McAlpine, associate professor of English at Britain’s Oxford University, told Reuters that the occasional “bleakness” of Ms. Glück’s voice speaks especially well to the “present moment”. For Ms. Glück, as she said in her interview to NYT, “the hope is that if you live through it, there will be art on the other side”. There is an awakening after darkness, she appears to say in ‘Snowdrops’ (The Wild Iris): “I did not expect to survive,/earth suppressing me. I didn’t expect/to waken again, to feel/in damp earth my body/able to respond again, remembering/after so long how to open again/in the cold light/of earliest spring – /afraid, yes, but among you again/crying yes risk joy/in the raw wind of the new world.”

As the world battles a stubborn pandemic, the Swedish Academy’s pick is perhaps a reminder that amid mind-numbing uncertainties, there is art. And when there is art, there is hope.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7gxomz/article32822659.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/louise-gluck-FINAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/louise-glck-the-revenge-against-circumstance/article32822660.ece
11,2020/10/10,World Food Programme | Leading the global fight against hunger,"The UN humanitarian organisation, which won this year’s Nobel Peace Prize, says there won’t be a peaceful world as long as there is hunger

The most devastating conflict of the 20th century, even arguably of all known history, was the Second World War. The war and its aftermath saw large-scale hunger and privation across all of Europe and other parts of the world that the conflict had touched, on a scale hitherto unknown.

It was against this backdrop that one of the war's most decorated Allied Generals spoke these words. “The children of today are forming each day the mental concepts, the mental prejudices, the emotions, that are going to rule and govern them through their lifetime; and over at least half of the year, they are hungry. In many instances, in many countries, almost universally, they are going in packs, up and down alleys, they are searching for a garbage heap in which they find all too little of any kind of sustenance that will keep them alive. Every man here who served with me in Europe has witnessed this with his own eyes. How can we expect children, who are reduced almost to an animal-like level of existence, struggling each day for any kind of scrap that will keep them alive, how can we expect them to develop the ideas and the ideals that in the future will bring them to be apostles of peace. They are, by the very nature of the struggle they are carrying on, wedded to the philosophy of force, whatever they get, they get by their own efforts and by scratching in the garbage heap. That cannot go on if we are to have peace.” This was the kernel of a stirring speech made by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1948, to the UN General Assembly.

Eisenhower's experience as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, which landed on the beaches of Normandy in 1944 and ultimately oversaw the final phase of the war in western Europe that ended with Germany’s defeat, had given him a unique insight into the deadly privations the devastating conflict had wrought on children in almost every country on the continent. It was this experience that forged his conviction that childhood hunger and peace were incompatible.

In 1960, Eisenhower, who was by now into his second term as President of the United States, again focussed an address to the UN on global hunger and proposed that the UN spearhead the creation of a multilateral effort to provide food aid wherever it was needed. “The United States is already carrying out substantial programmes to make its surpluses available to countries of greatest need. My country is also ready to join with other members of the UN in devising a workable scheme to provide food to member states through the UN system, relying on the advice and assistance of the Food and Agriculture Organization,” he told the UN General Assembly. This proposal was then brought to fruition in 1961, when another American Second World War veteran, George McGovern, led the efforts of President John F. Kennedy's administration at the UN to help establish the World Food Programme (WFP) — the winner this month of the Nobel Peace Prize. Within months of its creation, in September 1962, the WFP faced its first test. A deadly earthquake in northern Iran had claimed the lives of more than 12,000 people and rendered tens of thousands homeless and desperate for succour. The UN’s infant agency flew in 1,500 tonnes of wheat, 270 tonnes of sugar and 27 tonnes of tea, marking its baptism.

By 1965, the experimental agency with an initial mandate of three years had proved its worth to the world after responding to multiple crises and was enshrined as a fully fledged UN programme: it is to last for “as long as multilateral food aid is found feasible and desirable”.

Largest operation

The next two decades saw the organisation facing some of its sternest tests in terms of the scale of humanitarian crises it had to address. From the famines in the Sahel in northern Africa in the 1970s to the famine in Ethiopia in 1984 and the conflict in southern Sudan in the late 1980s, the WFP learnt to marshal resources as varied as camel caravans and flotilla of cargo planes provided by national air forces. “In 1989, Operation Lifeline Sudan is launched: leading a consortium of UN agencies and charities alongside UNICEF, WFP releases 1.5 million tonnes of food into the skies above what has since become South Sudan. The dawn-to-dusk, 20-aircraft, three-sorties-a-day airdrop remains, to this day, the largest in history. It saved hundreds of thousands of lives,” the WFP says on its website.

In the six decades since its founding, the WFP has now grown to become the world’s largest humanitarian agency, providing aid to almost 100 million people in more than 80 countries. Commanding one of the biggest non-military and non-commercial logistics operations worldwide, the Rome-headquartered agency on any given day has up to 5,600 trucks, 30 ships and almost 100 aircraft engaged in delivering food and other assistance to those needing aid as well as developmental support, including in some of remotest and often conflict-stricken parts of the globe.

The organisation has widened its operational remit and is now a leading provider of not just emergency food aid but also an agency engaged in supporting the nutritional requirements of communities through food assistance programmes. These vary from supporting school meals projects in different countries, including India, to the provision of cash and vouchers as a complement to in-kind food distributions.

While theatres of conflict remain the largest areas of widespread deprivation and hunger, the WFP’s interventions have been witnessed in the wake of multiple natural disasters: the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and closer home Nepal’s devastating temblor five years ago.

The organisation has also honed its response capabilities to the point where it is able to serve as the frontline telecommunications and logistical support provider to all UN agencies and NGOs in any crisis situation — from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to the Nepali earthquake of 2015.

Not free from criticism

For an agency funded entirely by donors ranging from governments, companies and individuals, the WFP has had to face its share of criticism. These range from charges that the aid it provides encourages corruption among local politicians and officials, who often sell the food supplies in the black market hurting local farmers and traders, to complaints that it destabilises whatever rudimentary market conditions that may be prevailing by making it hard for small local producers to compete.

But with conflicts still raging from Syria to Yemen and Afghanistan, communities threatened by climate change and the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic pushing millions more to the brink of starvation, as the WFP’s executive director David Beasley says in a statement acknowledging the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize: “Every one of the 690 million hungry people in the world today has the right to live peacefully and without hunger. Without peace, we cannot achieve our global goal of zero hunger; and while there is hunger, we will never have a peaceful world.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1ywqon/article32822606.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FoodART,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world-food-programme-leading-the-global-fight-against-hunger/article32822607.ece
12,2020/10/10,Golden Dawn | The party can’t go on,"A Greek court found the far-right party guilty of running a criminal organisation

Wednesday’s landmark guilty verdict against Greece’s far-right Golden Dawn party draws a line under the country’s violent ultra-nationalist surge in the aftermath of its sovereign banking and debt crises. In a case that has been compared to the Nuremberg trials to investigate the Nazi Holocaust, a three- member tribunal ruled that while the party’s several former Members of Parliament, including the founder Nikolaos Michaloliakos, ran a criminal organisation, others were culpable of involvement in various brutalities.

Among the guilty is a Golden Dawn supporter who murdered a hip-hop singer in September 2013, those who attacked trade union members affiliated to the Communist Party the same year and hooligans who assaulted Egyptian fishermen in 2012. In all, 68 defendants and 200 witnesses were involved in four cases in a trial that lasted five years. Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has hailed the verdict as a victory for democracy in the country.

Mr. Michaloliakos, a former special forces commando in the Greek Army, launched the neo-Nazi party in the 1980s. A known Holocaust denier and admirer of Hitler, he has described Golden Dawn as a party of patriotic nationalists. By the time of Mr. Michaloliakos’s 2010 election to the Athens city council, his black-clad party cadres, the Swasthika-like party emblem and torch-lit parades had gained notoriety for taunting and even physically targeting trade union activists and migrant workers in the capital’s working class suburbs.

Their hate-mongering was on vivid display even as Greek society was convulsed by crippling austerity and high unemployment. The Mayor of Athens who tried to block the party’s food distribution and blood bank programmes exclusively for native Greeks was punched by one of the MPs. Another slapped a woman legislator in the house, and a third attacked a female panellist in a television show. When the government was debating a new anti-racism law, Golden Dawn countered the proposal with a draft Bill to ban racism against the Greeks.

The party was catapulted into the national Parliament in 2012, when it polled 7% of the vote and garnered 18 seats to emerge the third largest in the 300-strong legislature. Its meteoric rise from a few thousand ballots in the previous elections was a direct consequence of the erosion of public trust in mainstream politics, three decades after the end of military dictatorship in Greece. The severe economic strictures that Athens submitted to in return for the EU’s three bailout packages served as a fertile ground for the party to peddle its polarising propaganda, pitting the poor and the pensioners against the influx of immigrants.

Murder of a musician

The September 2013 murder of Pavlos Fyssas, a highly popular hip-hop musician and anti-racism campaigner, marked the brutal climax of Golden Dawn’s violent track record. Even as the incident drew nationwide outrage and demands for the party to be outlawed, its infiltration into the police machinery forced the investigation into the crime to be transferred to the anti-terror unit. The subsequent months saw a number of Golden Dawn MPs being stripped of their parliamentary immunity from prosecution to face charges of involvement in racial attacks and belonging to a criminal group. The party’s participation in the 2014 European parliamentary elections was, however, cleared by the Supreme Court since the charges were yet to be proved.

The dip in poll ratings following the murder of Fyssas was but short-lived. In the January 2015 election, Golden Dawn retained almost all of its seats. Significantly, the party failed in last year’s polls to secure the minimum 3% vote threshold to gain entry into the legislature. Notwithstanding these reverses and Wednesday’s ruling, it would be premature to downplay the potency of the party. It is the raison d’etre of the far-right anywhere to tap into popular disaffection with the government over the conditions of living and fuel divisions of race, religion, nationality and all other conceivable social cleavages. Europe’s far-right has demonstrated a capacity to mobilise across countries. The singular focus of the judicial trial on holding Golden Dawn accountable for the brutalities, as distinct from the party’s narrow nationalist ideology, to counter the party perhaps holds wider significance.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/umcfdz/article32822669.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-GREECE-RACISM-TRAIL-POLITICS-PARTY-CRIME,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/golden-dawn-the-party-cant-go-on/article32822672.ece
13,2020/10/10,China protests latest U.S. Navy mission in South China Sea,"Beijing calls it blatant navigation hegemony and provocation

China said it dispatched ships and planes to track the U.S. guided-missile destroyer John S. McCain as it passed near Chinese-held islands in the South China Sea.

The People’s Liberation Army accused the U.S. warship of trespassing into Chinese territorial waters on Friday near the Paracel Islands — called Xisha by China — during the latest freedom of navigation missions by the U.S. Navy aimed at defying China’s vast claims in the strategic waterway.

Spokesperson for the PLA’s Southern Theater Command Colonel Zhang Nandong said Beijing demanded the U.S. end such actions, calling them “blatant navigation hegemony and military provocation” that “seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security interests, and gravely jeopardized peace and stability in the South China Sea.”

“We urges the U.S. side to immediately stop such kind of provocative actions, strictly manage and control its maritime and air military operations so as not to cause any eventuality”, Mr. Zhang was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua News Agency.

Counter claims

China claims sovereignty over virtually the entire South China Sea, which is also claimed in whole or in part by Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam. Frictions between China and Indonesia have also increased over activities by China’s fishing vessels, the Coast Guard and Navy within Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone.

China ignored a 2016 arbitration ruling that invalidated most of its claims in the South China Sea.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nfq4y2/article32822664.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-USA-TRUMPNAVY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-protests-latest-us-navy-mission-in-south-china-sea/article32822665.ece
14,2020/10/10,"Mideast wildfires kill 2, force thousands to flee homes","The fires come amid an intense heatwave that is unusual for this time of the year

Wildfires around the Middle East triggered by a heatwave hitting the region have killed two people, forced thousands of people to leave their homes and detonated landmines along the Lebanon-Israel border, state media and officials said Saturday.

The areas hit by the heatwave are Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territories. The fires come amid an intense heatwave that is unusual for this time of the year.

Wildfires spread across different areas of Israel and the West Bank for a second day on Saturday, forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes.

Israeli Police said in a statement firefighters and police forces evacuated 5,000 residents from the city of Nof Hagalil in northern Israel.

One of the hardest hit countries is war-torn Syria where fires have killed two people and left dozens suffering from breathing problems over the past two days. The wildfires also burnt wide areas of forests, mostly in the central province of Homs and the coastal province of Latakia.

With fire fighters overwhelmed, some residents helped them using primitive methods such as carrying water in buckets and pouring them on the fire.

Director of the Forestry Department in Latakia Agricultural Department, Bassem Douba, was quoted as saying by state news agency, SANA, that the number of fires reached 85 in different sites.

Also in Latakia province, fires in President Bashar Assad’s hometown of Qardaha heavily damaged a building used as a storage for the state-owned tobacco company, part of which collapsed.

In Lebanon, firefighters backed by army helicopters fought fires in the country’s north, center and south. A big fire in the southern village of Bater burnt hundreds of pine trees and was getting close to homes when it was put under control.

Along the border with Israel, fires were reported by Lebanon’s state news agency in several villages, some of them triggering explosions of land mines placed along the heavily-guarded front.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a063rq/article32821871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LEBANON-WILDFIRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wildfires-in-mideast/article32821872.ece
15,2020/10/10,Pakistan Opposition parties come out openly against powerful military,"Mr. Sharif alleged that the military rigged the 2018 elections to bring Prime Minister Imran Khan to power.

For the first time, Pakistan’s two major Opposition parties have come out openly against the country’s powerful military, accusing it of rigging the 2018 elections that brought Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf party to power.

In the past, political leaders have only indirectly pointed to the involvement of the military establishment in the country’s political affairs but this is the first time that the leaders of the two main Opposition parties — the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) have openly criticised the military.

Former prime minister and PML-N supremo Sharif, who is in London since November last year and facing a number of corruption cases, fired the first salvo at the inaugural meeting of the Pakistan Democratic Movement, an alliance formed by Opposition parties last month to oust Prime Minister Khan.

Mr. Sharif alleged that the military rigged the 2018 elections to bring Prime Minister Khan to power.

He said interfering in politics in uniform amounts to treason under the country’s Constitution.

His allegations sparked an angry response from Khan, who said Mr. Sharif was playing a very dangerous game by humiliating the military and intelligence services. He dismissed the allegations of rigged elections as baseless.

Mr. Sharif served as Pakistan’s prime minister three times, first removed by a president in 1993, then by military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 1999. A court in 2017 ousted him from power over corruption allegations. Khan, a former cricketer, came to power in 2018.

After Mr. Sharif, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Friday accused the military of rigging the 2018 elections.

Mr. Bilawal warned that any interference in the coming legislative assembly elections in Gilgit-Baltistan would lead to a strong reaction from his party, including a siege of Islamabad and a sit-in in the city.

Such things were never witnessed even in dictatorships of General Zia and Gen Musharraf, Mr. Bilawal was quoted as saying by the Dawn newspaper.

I wonder how you deploy a soldier inside and another outside the polling station. That was so strange. Even if you (military establishment) have done something wrong or not, you would be blamed either way. This should not happen, he said.

He said the “PPP would not allow anyone to steal the peoples mandate in the coming elections in Gilgit-Baltistan.”

Pakistan has announced that the once-postponed election for the legislative assembly of Gilgit-Baltistan will be held on November 15, amidst India’s strong objection to Islamabad’s move to alter the status of the militarily-occupied region.

India also clearly conveyed to Pakistan that the entire Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of the country. Pakistan’s military top brasses have in recent times advised political parties to stop dragging them into politics and making baseless accusations against them.

Prime Minister Khan on Friday said the Opposition’s real issue with the military is that they remained unable to control the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) unlike other institutions after the agency found out about their corruption.

On September 20, the leaders of 11 major Opposition parties formed the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) to launch a three-phased anti-government movement under an action plan starting with countrywide public meetings, protest demonstrations and rallies before a decisive long march towards Islamabad in January 2021.

The Opposition parties will hold their first combined rally against the Imran Khan-led government on October 16 in Gujranwala city in Punjab province, demanding to oust the “selected” prime minister’s resignation and an end to the role of the powerful military in the country’s politics.

The Opposition leaders had announced that they would use all political and democratic options, including no-confidence motions and mass resignations from Parliament to seek “the selected prime minister’s resignation and an end to the role of the establishment in politics.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/l6zoja/article32821836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NAWAZSHARIF-OPPOSITION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-opposition-parties-come-out-openly-against-powerful-military/article32821837.ece
16,2020/10/10,Didn’t discuss troops for peacekeeping or for New Delhi to engage Taliban directly: Dr. Abdullah Abdullah,"The participation of India in the inaugural session of the negotiations was welcomed by the people of Afghanistan and also the rest of the international community, says Afghanistan’s Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation

Afghanistan’s Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation has been in Delhi this week to brief the government on the Doha peace talks with the Taliban. Speaking to The Hindu, he said he received India’s full support for the peace process in talks with PM Narendra Modi, NSA Ajit Doval and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar.

You said you are on a mission to build regional consensus for the reconciliation process. Were there specific assurances you were hoping for during your visit to New Delhi?

Well, it wasn’t like we were expecting something specific — more like we were exchanging our views. India has been supportive of the people of Afghanistan, supportive of the peace process and we wanted to share the details of what is going on and see how best each country can contribute to that was the aim of the visit. I found very friendly audience like always. All the leaders that I met were supportive of the people of Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, a unified Afghanistan, and also a peaceful Afghanistan, and supportive of an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process. It’s a common view between us and India.

India has taken one step by attending the inauguration of the Doha talks, the first time an Indian official has actually addressed a gathering including the Taliban. Did you discuss whether India would engage the Taliban more directly now?

The participation of India in the inaugural session of the negotiations was welcomed by the people of Afghanistan and also the rest of the international community. All the countries of the region, in the neighbourhood, are being affected because of the continuation of the war in Afghanistan. A peaceful Afghanistan will be an opportunity, so India will be further engaged there. I didn’t have a specific recommendation as far as engagement with the Taliban is concerned, but I will say India will be playing an important role, active role with the rest of the partners of the international community from the region [in the process] and beyond.

India has at times been cut out of the process. Like for example when the six plus two plus one regional discussions were held, it did not include India. Do you think India will be included in all future regional conversations?

I think so. We should bear in mind that these negotiations only really started in September, and prior to that those were discussions in different quarters and countries. But talks have started now between the Afghans. India’s stand is that so long as the outcome is acceptable for the people of Afghanistan, and is not a threat to anybody, through harbouring terrorism or other means, that will be acceptable for India. That is a very principled position which is welcomed.

Also read | India’s presence at talks with Taliban an important step, says Zalmay Khalilzad

One of the outstanding issues has been the lack of a ceasefire announcement by the Taliban. And a large part of the Taliban leadership does live in Pakistan. Did you receive any assurances on Pakistan’s support when it comes to announcing a ceasefire, during your visit there last week?

[We are still hopeful of] a ceasefire or significant reduction in violence. [Pakistani officials] were supportive of that idea and they also promised that they will communicate this and they will try to use their own influence to achieve that. We had extensive discussions on that as well as other aspects of the situation, for a peaceful Afghanistan. And thereby, I was assured that they will make efforts.

Even so, are you at all hopeful? I’m just looking at the figures — 1,300 civilian casualties in the first half of this year, a 60% rise in attacks on Afghan forces from this quarter compared to the previous quarter….

If you speak of the expectations of the people of Afghanistan, they were expecting that as the talks start, we will have a ceasefire or a significant reduction in violence. Our negotiating team was ready from day one to start discussions on a ceasefire. But these are complicated situations and we are only meeting the Taliban for talks now, rather than in the battle zones as we have for the past three decades. We are not under any illusions about the challenges that we are faced with. The progress so far has been slow. Hopefully, with the help of different players and also with the patience that we will show, the civility we will show there will be a transition to less violence.

But will talks continue regardless of whether that violence continues?

The talks should continue. But it’s not as if the violence can continue forever and the talks will continue forever. Without progress in the talks that’s not viable, that’s not sustainable and we do want to get to the other parts of the agenda.

What else is part of the talks? While the government has said the political structure of Afghanistan is not negotiable, from the Taliban side, the understanding seems to be that everything is on the table. So, is there a bottom line that says democracy is non-negotiable, the rights of women and minorities are non-negotiable?

Taliban will raise their own ideas and we will raise our own ideas. Can we agree on a common stand which accommodates the different views? The question is can we agree that while maintaining different views, we live in one system and compete and contest for the realisation of those ideas peacefully, through civil and peaceful means? That’s the bottom line.

Are you on the same page as the Afghan government? Just 10 months ago, you were in a legal battle with President Ghani contesting the presidential elections you both fought. Do you feel that the differences that you and President Ghani have had are an impediment to the peace process?

That’s democracy. Given the fact that we contested elections [against each other] means that we were not on the same page on some issues. But when it is in the interest of the country, in the interest of peaceful Afghanistan, democratic Afghanistan, an Afghanistan which respects the rights of its citizens, men, women, minorities and others, on that we are on the same page.

President Trump has already said that by Christmas, he hopes to have U.S. troops return. Other officials have said maybe 2,500 troops will remain in Afghanistan. Are you also considering the possible need for a regional peacekeeping force if the Americans do pull out completely?

First of all, on the recent announcement by President Trump, the details are not yet available to us. They already had announced according to their agreement, to keep 4,500 troops and to pull-out the rest of it, which will be completed by November. So, we are not sure what these announcements refer to. But eventually, Afghanistan needs to stand on its own feet and support from the region for a peaceful, inclusive settlement in Afghanistan is important. Hopefully, we will get to an agreement that that will not require security forces from other countries to keep us safe.

But have you discussed that possibility in India?

No, no, that was not part of our discussions.

As part of the Northern Alliance you fought with the Taliban for years. In government you were targeted, suffered attacks. Have you reconciled with a process that will bring the same people into the mainstream, perhaps into a place of power in government, that you have fought for so much of your life?

The point is that I have fought for certain principles in my life — the independence of Afghanistan, certain liberties, the rights of the people and those values. And that will not change. What type of shape that fighting will take, whether we can fight for it through peaceful means and without resorting to violence, that can change. What happened to me, and I survived several attacks, some very close calls. But look at the suffering of the people: sometimes as many as 50-100 people are killed in one day, sometimes, that needs to come to an end. That’s much more than these emotions or feelings and certainly when it comes to my experience in Afghanistan, I believe that there are no winners in a war, there are no losers in an inclusive, peaceful settlement.

Are you saying peace at any cost?

An acceptable, dignified, sustainable peace.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/l2fq89/article32821180.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ABDULLAHABDULLAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/didnt-discuss-troops-for-peacekeeping-or-for-new-delhi-to-engage-taliban-directly-dr-abdullah-abdullah/article32821163.ece
17,2020/10/10,"North Korea displays ICBMs, Kim Jong Un apologises for economic woes","He thanks troops for preventing coronavirus outbreak .

North Korea unveiled previously unseen intercontinental ballistic missiles at an unprecedented predawn military parade on Saturday that showcased the country’s long-range weapons for the first time in two years.

Analysts said the missile, which was shown on a transporter vehicle with 11 axles, would be one of the largest road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in the world if it becomes operational. “This missile is a monster,” said Melissa Hanham, deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network.

Also displayed were the Hwasong-15, which is the longest-range missile ever tested by North Korea, and what appeared to be a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).

Ahead of the parade, which was held to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party, officials in South Korea and the United States said Kim Jong-un could use the event to unveil a new “strategic weapon” as promised earlier this year.

A senior U.S. administration official called the display of the ICBM “disappointing” and called on the government to negotiate to achieve a complete denuclearisation.

The parade featured North Korea’s ballistic missiles for the first time since Mr. Kim began meeting with international leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, in 2018.

“We will continue to build our national defence power and self-defensive war deterrence,” Mr. Kim said, but vowed that the country’s military power would not be used preemptively. He made no direct mention of the United States or the now-stalled denuclearisation talks.

Mr. Kim blamed international sanctions, typhoons, and the coronavirus for preventing him from delivering on promises of economic progress.

“I am ashamed that I have never been able to repay you properly for your enormous trust,” he said. “My efforts and devotion were not sufficient to bring our people out of difficult livelihoods.”

The video showed Mr. Kim make an appearance as a clock struck midnight. Dressed in a grey suit and tie, he waved to the crowd and accepted flowers from children while surrounded by military officials in Pyongyang’s recently renovated Kim-il Sung Square.

Emotional moment

Mr. Kim spoke for nearly half an hour, often visibly sweating despite the cool morning air, shedding tears when thanking the troops, and smiling and laughing as he watched the missiles.

The parade was highly choreographed, with thousands of troops marching in formation, displays of new conventional military equipment including tanks, and fighter jets launching flares and fireworks.

Experts said that the new, larger ICBM is likely designed to carry multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing it to attack more targets and making interception more difficult.

‘Implicit threat’

The new ICBM is likely intended to dispel doubts about North Korea’s ability to strike the continental U.S., and an implicit threat that they are preparing to test the larger missile, said Markus Garlauskas, a former U.S. intelligence officer for North Korea. “If the Hwasong-15 could carry a ‘super-large’ nuclear warhead to anywhere in the U.S., then the natural question is what can this larger missile carry?,” he said.

18,2020/10/10,U.K. plans new three-tier system of COVID-19 lockdown measures,"According to a letter seen by the BBC, the details of each tier, including the level of infection at which an area would qualify for it and the nature of the restrictions, are being debated this weekend.

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to unveil a new three-tier system of measures alongside local regions across the country being handed greater decision-making powers as part of efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).

The new so-called traffic light system, to be laid out in the House of Commons on Monday, will see the most severe measures imposed for areas of England fall within the third tier and people being ordered not to have any social contact with anyone outside their household together with the expected closures of pubs, bars and restaurants where some of the highest numbers of cases are occurring.

Tier one is likely to see people expected to follow the rule of six on gatherings and maintain social-distancing. Tier two could ban households from mixing in homes, gardens, pubs, bars or restaurants.

According to a letter seen by the BBC, the details of each tier, including the level of infection at which an area would qualify for it and the nature of the restrictions, are being debated this weekend.

Mr. Johnson’s Chief Strategic Adviser Edward Lister has written to the members of Parliament to highlight engagement with local authority leaders as part of the process. It comes amid mounting criticism of the government using a top-down approach by shutting down parts of northern England without a full engagement process with the local authorities.

The government is operating under the misguided, arrogant and counterproductive view that ‘Whitehall knows best’, that decisions can be made behind closed doors, without any real consultation or even picking up the phone to those on the frontline, Opposition Labour Party Leader Kier Starmer wrote in ‘The Daily Telegraph’ earlier in the week.

Meanwhile, the British Medical Association (BMA) also criticised the government’s approach to reduce the spread of the virus and called for compulsory face coverings across all settings.

COVID-19 is just as infectious in offices as in supermarkets. We need clear consistent policy now requiring masks in all settings where people mix outside their household and not 2 metres apart,” said Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, BMA Council Chair.

A number of areas in the northern and Midlands of England are already subject to stricter restrictions, with the new tiered system being designed to try and better organise the differing set of rules for different parts of the U.K..

Public Health England’s national infection service warned that the number of cases was rising all over the country, but more quickly in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber than the South.

Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said he expected Liverpool — where there are currently 600 cases per 1,00,000 people — to be placed in tier three, under the highest set of restrictions.

Other cities, such as Leeds and Sheffield, could fall in the top tier. There is also a debate about whether the tiers should be tightly drawn around larger cities, or include the suburbs where infections are less.

Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan repeated his warnings that tougher restrictions in the U.K. capital are inevitable.

You’ve got three buckets: level one the least restrictions, level three the most – similar to lockdown-type measures. What’s clear to me is that it’s inevitable there will be additional restrictions in London, he told ‘LBC Radio.’

And one of the things we are discussing as ‘one London’ – that’s me and the 32/33 boroughs – is what we think the right level should be and then work with government to make sure we have the right level there, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-plans-new-three-tier-system-of-covid-19-lockdown-measures/article32820857.ece
19,2020/10/10,New Zealand election 2020 | PM Jacinda Ardern votes a week before polls close,"More than 700,000 people had voted by Saturday, a week before the official election day of October 17, according to the New Zealand Electoral Commission

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has voted in the nation’s general election, a week before polls officially close.

Ms. Ardern cast her vote in her Auckland district Saturday after visiting a market in the heavily Polynesian south Auckland suburb of Otara, where she was thronged by supporters.

Ms. Ardern’s Labour Party has governed since the 2017 general election, when it was able to forge a narrow majority in New Zealand’s 120-seat Parliament in a coalition with the left-wing Greens and right-wing New Zealand First parties.

Recent polls show a more comfortable result this year, with the Labour Party leading the National Party, led by 61-year-old conservative Judith Collins, by as many as 13 points.

More than 700,000 people had voted by Saturday, a week before the official election day of October 17, according to the New Zealand Electoral Commission. Hundreds of thousands more are expected to vote during the coming week.

Ms. Ardern’s visit to Otara was an effort to get out the vote in an electorate in which Labour out-polls National by around four votes to one.

“We’re seeing really high turnout at the moment for advance voting. We want to make sure everyone uses their voice until election day,” Ms. Ardern said.

Voters have four choices to make this year. They are picking a candidate to represent their electorate and choosing which party to give their party vote. Seats in Parliament are allocated on the basis of seats won and the percentage of the vote won by each party.

Voters also face two referendums. They will vote on the decriminalization of cannabis and on the legalization of assisted dying in limited cases.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cvt2vi/article32820686.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWZEALAND-ELECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-zealand-election-2020-pm-jacinda-ardern-votes-a-week-before-polls-close/article32820687.ece
20,2020/10/10,Divers discover French WWI submarine off Tunisia,"The almost intact wreck is covered in algae, its hatches and periscope now home to fish and crustaceans

Tunisian divers have discovered a French submarine wreck from World War I, the Ariane, which was sunk by a German submarine in 1917.

The craft was spotted off Cap Bon by the managers of a diving club in the country's northeast as they were exploring new sites to explore with their students.

“We knew they were wrecks but we didn't know what we were going to find,” said the diving director of the Ras Adar club, Selim Baccar. “On the first dive, we came across the submarine.”

The almost intact wreck is covered in algae, its hatches and periscope now home to fish and crustaceans.

After questioning several experts, the club deduced it could only be the Ariane, which was based in Bizerte, at the time a French port in northern Tunisia.

“This is the third submarine found in Tunisia, and the only one from the First World War. It's exciting, as if a history book has come to life,” said Baccar. “We came across military reports detailing minute by minute everything that was happening in the Mediterranean. And when we go back to that situation, I say to myself that I'm glad I didn't experience a war.”

During the First World War, German submarines wreaked havoc off the Tunisian coast, where they were initially deployed to cut the Allies off from their reinforcements of men and provisions from the French colonies, said historian Ali Ait Mihoub, from Manouba university.

About 80,000 Tunisians were mobilised to fight or work in French factories during WWI, he told AFP.

The Ariane was torpedoed by a German U-Boat while still on the surface, and only eight of the 29 crew could be saved, according AGASM, a French association of former submarine operators.

“It is not common to find wrecks of submarines, especially from the First World War, because we don't know exactly where they sank,” said Admiral Dominique Salles, president of the group.

Submarines, which played a decisive role for the first time during WWI, then provided very basic comfort. The French submarines, which originally had neither bunks nor toilets, were submersibles that remained mostly on the surface, says the Encyclopedia of French Submarines. They would only dive for a few hours at a time, for attacks, during which men and food were piled up in a suffocating engine room.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ok3kj7/article32820628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0008RP2MH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/divers-discover-french-wwi-submarine-off-tunisia/article32820630.ece
21,2020/10/10,Pakistan court asks Nawaz Sharif to appear by Nov. 24 to avoid being declared proclaimed offender,"The Registrar of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) issued a written order about the proceedings on the appeal by Sharif in Al-Azizia and Avenfield graft cases, the Dawn News reported

A Pakistani court has ordered Nawaz Sharif to appear before it by November 24 to avoid being declared a proclaimed offender after the former premier allegedly refused to receive non-bailable arrest warrants at his residence in London.

The Registrar of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday issued a written order about the proceedings on the appeal by Sharif in Al-Azizia and Avenfield graft cases, the Dawn News reported.

On October 7, the court recorded the statements of Dildar Ali Abro, the first secretary (consular affairs), and Rao Abdul Hannan, consular attaché, Pakistan High Commission, London, as well as Mohammad Mubashir Khan, director for Europe-I, at the Foreign Ministry.

They told the court that efforts were made in compliance with the court orders to effect service of non-bailable warrants of arrest on Sharif to ensure his attendance in the court.

Despite efforts, that service of warrant, issued by the Islamabad High Court on September 15, could not be effected, they said.

Irked by the attitude of Mr. Sharif’s representatives at his residence in London, the High Court on October 7 ordered that the advertisements be issued in newspapers to summon him.

The court directed the federal government to bear the cost of the advertisements in the Dawn and Jang newspapers.

The government later told the court that ₹60,000 were paid for advertisement in the nominated papers.

The court has asked Mr. Sharif to appear before it by November 24 otherwise he would be designated as a proclaimed offender. The proclamation may result in the confiscation of his properties as well as passport.

Mr. Sharif has been living in London since November last year after he was allowed by the courts and the government to go there for a period of eight weeks for medical treatment. But he did not come back, while his lawyers told the court that he was still recovering.

However, he made a scathing speech on September 20, blaming the armed forces for interference in politics.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v1v09y/article32466643.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NAWAZSHARIF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-court-asks-nawaz-sharif-to-appear-by-nov-24-to-avoid-being-declared-proclaimed-offender/article32820447.ece
22,2020/10/10,"WFP chief seeks aid from donors, billionaires for food","David Beasley urged donors, including governments and institutions, to help, and he made a special appeal to the more than 2,000 billionaires in the world to open their bank accounts

Even before COVID-19 became an issue, World Food Programme chief David Beasley was warning global leaders that the world would face the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II in 2020.

He said that was because of wars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, locust swarms in Africa, frequent natural disasters, and economic crises including in Lebanon, Congo, Sudan and Ethiopia. Then came COVID-19 which quickly became a pandemic that has swept the world, escalating the need for food — and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says it is still not under control.

Mr. Beasley, who got COVID-19 in April, has spent the months since he recovered reaching out to world leaders and visiting stricken countries with a new warning that he delivered to the UN Security Council last month: millions of people are closer to starvation because of the deadly combination of conflict, climate change and the coronavirus pandemic.

He said the WFP and its partners were going all out to reach as many as 138 million people this year — the biggest scale-up in our history.

Mr. Beasley urged donors, including governments and institutions, to help, and he made a special appeal to the more than 2,000 billionaires in the world, with a combined net worth of $8 trillion, to open their bank accounts.

Mr. Beasley called the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the WFP a humbling, moving recognition of the work of the staff who lay their lives on the line every day to bring food and assistance for close to 100 million hungry children, women and men across the world — people whose lives are often brutally torn apart by instability, insecurity and conflict.

He also paid tribute to the agency’s government, organisations and private sector partners who help the hungry and vulnerable.

Every one of the 690 million hungry people in the world today has the right to live peacefully and without hunger, Mr. Beasley said in a statement on the WFP website.

“Today, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has turned the global spotlight on them and on the devastating consequences of conflict. Climate shocks and economic pressures have further compounded their plight,” he said. “And now, a global pandemic with its brutal impact on economies and communities, is pushing millions more to the brink of starvation”.

“While the food crisis is mainly the result of conflict,” Mr. Beasley said in April, he added that he raised the prospect of a hunger pandemic because of the economic impact of COVID-19.

He told the Security Council last month that famine has been averted because of generous donations, but this fight is far from over — the 270 million people marching toward the brink of starvation need our help today more than ever. He said 30 million people who rely solely on WFP for food to survive will die without it, and WFP needs $4.9 billion to feed them for a year.

“We’re doing just about all we can do to stop the dam from bursting,” Mr. Beasley said. “But, without the resources we need, a wave of hunger and famine still threatens to sweep across the globe. And if it does, it will overwhelm nations and communities already weakened by years of conflict and instability”.

WFP’s logistics operation is key to delivering food to tens of millions in need, and lockdowns and closed borders because of the pandemic have created immense difficulties for the agency.

Mr. Beasley has stressed that measures to contain the coronavirus must be balanced with the need to keep supply chains and trade moving across borders. He has repeatedly expressed concern over COVID-19 shutdowns not only impeding the delivery of food but worsening other problems, such as disrupting vaccinations and treatments for other illnesses.

“There is a grave danger that many more people will die from the broader economic and social consequences of COVID-19 that from the virus itself, especially in Africa,” he has said, adding that the last thing we need is to have the cure be worse than the disease itself.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xeskhc/article32819557.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DAVIDBEASLEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wfp-chief-seeks-aid-from-donors-billionaires-for-food/article32819540.ece
23,2020/10/10,Scientist accused of hiding Chinese funds sues Harvard over legal fees,"“It is disturbing that Harvard acted solely its in own self-interest by turning its back on a dedicated faculty member who suffers from a terminal illness and who is presumed innocent,” the lawsuit says

A Harvard University professor charged with hiding his ties to a Chinese-run recruitment program sued the Ivy League school on Friday over its refusal to pay his legal defense costs, accusing it of “turning its back on a dedicated faculty member.”

Charles Lieber, who was chair of the department of chemistry and chemical biology, was arrested in January at his office on campus and charged in federal court with lying about his involvement in China’s Thousand Talents Plan, a program designed to lure people with knowledge of foreign technology and intellectual property to China.

Lieber’s attorney, Marc Mukasey, has promised to mount a vigorous defense and has said that “when justice is done, Charlie’s good name will be restored.”

The lawsuit says Harvard denied Lieber’s request to advance his defense costs, hasn’t agreed to reimburse him at all and is demanding that he essentially “prove definitively his innocence to Harvard” before his trial to get financial help. “Employees who find themselves accused of wrongdoing rely on their employers’ promises to pay their defense costs,” the complaint says.

“Instead of following suit, and supporting their long-standing, well-respected employee, Harvard has placed Professor Lieber on administrative leave, publicly denounced him, improperly characterized the charges against him, and permanently and falsely associated him with academic espionage, forever harming his reputation,” it said.

A Harvard spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit. The university is cooperating with authorities in the criminal case.

The lawsuit accuses Harvard of breach of contract and says the school’s failure to follow through will leave Lieber, who was diagnosed years ago with a blood cancer, and his family “impoverished.”

“It is disturbing that Harvard acted solely its in own self-interest by turning its back on a dedicated faculty member who suffers from a terminal illness and who is presumed innocent. More importantly, it is illegal,” the lawsuit says.

Authorities say Lieber was paid $50,000 a month by the Wuhan University of Technology in China under his Thousand Talents Program contract and awarded more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab at the Chinese university. In exchange, prosecutors say, Lieber agreed to apply for patents and do other work on behalf of the Chinese university.

Authorities say Lieber lied about ties to the program and the Chinese university, telling federal authorities that he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Plan. He’s been indicted by a grand jury on two counts of making false statements to authorities - a charge that calls for up to five years in prison if he is convicted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eegytq/article32819435.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARVARDSLAVERY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/scientist-accused-of-hiding-chinese-funds-sues-harvard-over-legal-fees/article32819437.ece
24,2020/10/10,Hong Kong police arrest nine suspected of helping 12 held in China,"Four men and five women, suspected of arranging transport for the 12 fugitives.

Hong Kong police said on Saturday they had arrested nine people suspected of helping 12 Hong Kong activists who fled the city in August, heading for Taiwan, only to be intercepted by Chinese authorities and held on the mainland.

The dozen, accused of crimes tied to anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, are being detained in the southern city of Shenzhen after authorities intercepted their boat and accused them of illegal border crossing.

Superintendent Ho Chun-tung, of the police's organised crime and triad bureau, said they had arrested four men and five women, suspected of arranging transport for the 12 fugitives.

He did not rule out the possibility of further arrests.

The police also seized HK$500,000 ($64,500) in cash, computers, mobile phones, and documents related to the purchase of a boat, Ho said.

The detainees' case has grabbed international headlines and human rights groups have raised concerns. The families say the detainees have been denied access to independent lawyers.

Hong Kong authorities have said the 12 will be represented by mainland lawyers chosen by the detainees from a list provided by Chinese authorities, and that they have offered “needed and feasible” assistance to the families and will continue to do so.

People began fleeing to Taiwan from the early months of the Hong Kong protests last year, mostly legally by air, but sometimes by fishing boat, activists in Taipei who have helped Hong Kong citizens obtain visas, have told Reuters.

This has caused a dilemma for Taiwan, which has promised assistance to the people of Hong Kong but is wary of antagonising China.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y2j6bz/article32819309.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THHONGKONDPOLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hong-kong-police-arrest-nine-suspected-of-helping-12-held-in-china/article32819310.ece
25,2020/10/10,"China has deployed 60,000 soldiers on India’s northern border: Pompeo","The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hits out at Beijing for its ‘bad behaviour’

China has amassed more than 60,000 troops on India’s northern border, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said as he hit out at Beijing for its “bad behaviour” and the threats it poses to the Quad countries.

The Foreign Ministers from the Indo-Pacific nations known as the Quad group — the US, Japan, India and Australia — met in Tokyo on Tuesday in what was their first in-person talks since the coronavirus pandemic began.

The meeting took place in the backdrop of China’s aggressive military behaviour in the Indo-Pacific, South China Sea and along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.

“The Indians are seeing 60,000 Chinese soldiers on their northern border, Mr. Pompeo told The Guy Benson Show in an interview on Friday after his return from Tokyo wherein he attended the second Quad ministerial with his counterparts from India, Japan and Australia.

“I was with my foreign minister counterparts from India, Australia, and Japan — a format that we call the Quad, four big democracies, four powerful economies, four nations, each of whom has real risk associated with the threats imposed — attempting to be imposed by the Chinese Communist Party. And they see it in their home countries too,” he said.

Also read: India rejects China’s ‘unilateral’ claims on LAC

Mr. Pompeo met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in Tokyo on Tuesday and they underscored the need to work together to advance, peace, prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe. He described his meeting with Jaishankar as “productive.”

“They see, the people of their (Quad) nations understanding that we all slept on this for too long. For decades, the West allowed the Chinese Communist Party to walk all over us. The previous administration bent a knee, too often allowed China to steal our intellectual properties and the millions of jobs that came along with it. They see that in their country too,” he said in the interview.

In another interview with Larry O’Connor, Mr. Pompeo said in his meetings with his counterparts from Japan, India and Australia, they began to develop a set of understandings and policies that can jointly take these countries to work to present a true resistance to the threats that the Chinese Communist Party poses to each of these nations.

“They absolutely need the United States to be their ally and partner in this fight,” he said.

“But they’ve all seen it, whether it’s the Indians, who are actually having a physical confrontation with the Chinese up in the Himalayas in the northeastern part of India, the Chinese have now begun to amass huge forces against India in the north — whether it’s the Australians who did the simple thing of saying the Chinese screwed this deal up with the virus, and we’d like to understand what happened and said we ought to have a full investigation, and in exchange for that, the Chinese Communist Party began to extort, coerce, bully the Australians, Mr. Pompeo said.

Every one of these countries has seen this, he said, adding that people in each of these countries now understand the Chinese Communist Party presents a threat to them. “The world has awakened. The tide’s begun to turn. And the United States under President Trump’s leadership has now built out a coalition that will push back against the threat and maintain good order, the rule of law, and the basic civic decency that comes from democracies controlling the world and not authoritarian regimes,” Mr. Pompeo said.

Coalition against China

In his third-interview to Fox News, Mr. Pompeo said that the US under Trump administration has begun to build out all the edifice of the structure and the allies and the coalition to push back against China.

“We aim to protect the American people from the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses,” he said.

Referring to his Quad ministerial meeting, Pompeo said that the three other countries Japan, India, and Australia were building out a coalition, build partners and allies around the world who understand the threat from the Chinese Communist Party in the same way that “we do so that they can protect jobs here at home“.

“Look, they’ve stacked 60,000 soldiers against the Indians in the north. When the Australians had the temerity to ask for an investigation of the Wuhan virus and where it began, something that we know a lot about, the Chinese Communist Party threatened them. They bullied them, Mr. Pompeo told Fox News.

“We need partners and friends. They’ll certainly try to react. But what the Chinese Communist Party had become accustomed to, frankly, for an awfully long time was watching America bend a knee, watching us turn the other cheek and appease them,” he said.

“That only encouraged their bad behaviour, their malign activity. Our push back — they understand we’re serious about it. They’ve watched that we’re going to confront them and impose costs upon them. I am confident that this activity, over time, will change the nature of what the Chinese Communist Party tries to do to harm America, Mr. Pompeo said.

27,2020/10/10,"COVID-19 vaccine delivery to begin in January, says U.S. official","The administration “is accelerating production of safe and effective vaccines ... to ensure delivery starting January 2021,” says Dr. Robert Kadlec

A Trump administration official leading the response to the coronavirus pandemic says the U.S. can expect delivery of a vaccine starting in January 2021, despite statements from the President that inoculations could begin this month.

And a growing, bipartisan chorus of lawmakers, experts and public health officials says the country is ill prepared for a projected winter surge of COVID-19.

Watch | Oxford's COVID-19 vaccine shows positive results

Dr. Robert Kadlec said in an email Friday that the administration “is accelerating production of safe and effective vaccines ... to ensure delivery starting January 2021.” Dr. Kadlec is the Department of Health and Human Services’ assistant secretary of preparedness and response. HHS says a vaccine could be approved before the end of the year but will take time to distribute.

President Donald Trump has said at rallies, debates and press conferences that a vaccine could arrive within weeks. “We think we can start sometime in October,” Mr. Trump said at a White House press briefing last month.

Dr. Kadlec wasn’t the first health official to counter the president’s optimistic timeline. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Thursday that there could be 100 million vaccine doses available by the end of the year “pending FDA authorizations.” And Dr. Moncef Slaoui, who is leading the government’s vaccine effort, told Marketwatch on Friday that researchers could know “by late October, or November, or in December” whether one of the vaccines in development is effective, but that it would then take weeks to get emergency authorization to administer it.

When asked about the disparity, the White House was not specific on a date but said Trump’s priority is to distribute a vaccine “as soon as possible.” Kadlec said, without elaborating, that it wasn’t correct to conclude that this meant the country couldn’t see a vaccine sooner than January.

Dr. Kadlec was responding to a series of questions from and FRONTLINE about the administration’s response to the pandemic and, in particular, about shortages of critical medical supplies.

Roughly nine months into the pandemic, health care workers and even the Government Accountability Office report there still isn’t enough protective equipment for frontline workers or adequate coordination from the federal government. And although there are emergency preparedness and response plans in place, implementation has been inconsistent.

""We went into this pandemic unprepared, and we remain so months later,” said Boris Lushniak, former acting surgeon general in the Obama administration. “It is time to reevaluate the complete medical supply chain in the U.S. The federal government needs to take on the leadership role here.”

Across the country, public health leaders are warning about the coming months.

""A cohesive national plan for equitably distributing PPE has still not been proposed, let alone implemented,” said Harvard Medical School professor Dr. Andrew T. Chan, who found Black, Hispanic and Asian health care workers had the highest risk of contracting COVID-19. “Thus, we will continue to fly by the seat of our pants with our fingers crossed for the foreseeable future.”

Michael Lu, dean of University of California, Berkeley’s school of public health, said one important part of the solution lies in a bipartisan bill fast tracked in the Senate that would rebuild the Strategic National Stockpile and strengthen U.S. manufacturing of medical masks, gowns and other protective gear.

“We weren’t ready for the pandemic,” Lu said. “And we are still not ready.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ilnsvs/article32818811.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDROBERTKADLEC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-vaccine-delivery-to-begin-in-january-says-us-official/article32818812.ece

Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to a Russia-brokered ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh starting Saturday, but immediately accused each other of derailing the deal intended to end the worst outbreak of hostilities in the separatist region in more than a quarter-century.

The Hindu Explains | What’s behind the Armenia-Azerbaijan clashes?

The two sides traded blame for breaking the truce that took effect at noon (0800 GMT) with new attacks, and Azerbaijan’s top diplomat said the truce never entered force.

The ceasefire announcement came overnight after 10 hours of talks in Moscow, sponsored by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The deal stipulated that the ceasefire should pave the way for talks on settling the conflict.

If the truce holds, it would mark a major diplomatic coup for Russia, which has a security pact with Armenia but also cultivated warm ties with Azerbaijan. But the agreement was immediately challenged by mutual claims of violations.

Minutes after the truce took force, the Armenian military accused Azerbaijan of shelling the area near the town of Kapan in southeastern Armenia, killing one civilian. Azerbaijan’s Defence Ministry rejected the accusations as a “provocation.”

The Azerbaijani military, in turn, accused Armenia of striking the Terter and Agdam regions of Azerbaijan with missiles and then attempting to launch offensives in the Agdere-Terter and the Fizuli-Jabrail areas. Azerbaijan’s Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov charged that “conditions for implementing the humanitarian cease-fire are currently missing” amid the continuing Armenian shelling.

Armenia’s Defence Ministry denied any truce violations.

The latest outburst of fighting between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces began September 27 and left hundreds of people dead in the biggest escalation of the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh since a separatist war there ended in 1994.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ljydvk/article32818770.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDNAGOMO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/truce-not-holding-say-armenia-and-azerbaijan/article32818771.ece
29,2020/10/10,Ex-officer charged in George Floyd’s death freed on $1 million bond,"Derek Chauvin was released from state prison, leading Minnesota’s governor to activate the National Guard to help keep the peace in the event of protests

The former Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in the death of George Floyd posted bail on Wednesday and was released from state prison, leading Minnesota’s governor to activate the National Guard to help keep the peace in the event of protests.

According to court documents, Derek Chauvin posted a USD 1 million bond and was released from the state’s facility in Oak Park Heights, where he had been detained.

Floyd, a Black man in handcuffs, died on May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes as Floyd said he couldn’t breathe.

Floyd’s death was captured in widely seen bystander video that set off protests around the world. Chauvin and three other officers were fired. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter; Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.

Upon news of Chauvin’s release, Gov. Tim Walz activated the National Guard to help local law enforcement.

Mr Walz said the Guard was mobilizing 100 soldiers and providing equipment and facilities “out of an abundance of caution” in light of public safety concerns.

Mr Walz said 100 state troopers and 75 Department of Natural Resources conservation officers were also mobilized to help local authorities.

As darkness fell on Wednesday evening, hundreds of people took to the streets in south Minneapolis where protests were centered in the days after George Floyd’s death.

They marched several blocks and blocked an intersection for a time, with chants including, “No Justice, No Peace — Prosecute the Police“.

Floyd family attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci released a statement saying Chauvin’s release “is a painful reminder” that the family is far from getting justice.

“The system of due process worked for Chauvin and afforded him his freedom while he awaits trial. In contrast, George Floyd was denied due process, when his life was ended over a USD 20 bill. There was no charge, no arrest, no hearing, no bail. Just execution,” the attorneys wrote.

Floyd’s aunt, Angela Harrelson, told FOX-9 that she was still trying to process the news.

“It’s something that I’m not happy with. I’m not pleased with it. But I know I have to accept it because this is what the judge allowed to happen. ... I know our family is not happy with this decision,” Harrelson said.

Source of funds

It was not immediately clear where Chauvin got the money to pay his bond. In Minnesota, someone who posts bond is required to pay 10%, in this case USD 100,000, to the bail bond company.

Then, the company and the defendant work out an arrangement for collateral to back all or part of the rest of the bond amount, said Mike Brandt, a criminal defense attorney who is not connected to the case.

A message left with the company that posted the bond, Allegheny Casualty Company, was not immediately returned.

The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, which has a legal defense fund, did not provide any money for bail, a spokeswoman said. Bob Kroll, president of the Minneapolis Police Officers Federation, said his union was not involved.

The website GiveSendGo.com, which says it is a free Christian crowdfunding site, has a Derek Chauvin Bail Fund that says it was created by his family.

According to the site, as of midday Wednesday that fund raised USD 4,198 of its USD 125,000 goal, with donations from more than 35 people. A posting on the site dated September 12 said it took time to set up a fundraising effort due to the high-profile nature of the case.

Conditions

Chauvin had the option of posting bail for USD 1.25 million without conditions or USD 1 million with conditions.

Under the conditions of his release, he must attend all court appearances, cannot have any direct or indirect contact — including social media contact — with any members of Floyd’s family, cannot work in law enforcement or security, and must not possess any firearms or ammunition.

Chauvin’s attorney had no comment on Wednesday.

Chauvin’s wife, Kellie Chauvin, filed for divorce shortly after Floyd’s death. The records in that case have since been sealed and Kellie Chauvin’s divorce attorney didn’t immediately reply to a message seeking comment.

In July, the Chauvins were charged with multiple felony counts of tax evasion for allegedly failing to report income from various jobs, including more than USD 95,000 from Derek Chauvin’s off-duty security work.

The criminal complaints in that case allege that from 2014 through 2019, the Chauvins under-reported their joint income by USD 4,64,433 and owe the state USD 37,868 in unpaid taxes, interest and fees.

The tax evasion case also listed other assets, including the couple’s second home in Florida and a USD 100,000 BMW.

The Chauvin home in the St. Paul suburb of Oakdale was sold on August 28 for USD 279,000, which was USD 26,000 less than the price it was listed at a month after Floyd’s death, according to online real estate records.

It was not clear where Chauvin was staying after his release, but one of the conditions of his bail was that he not leave Minnesota without permission.

The other three officers charged in Floyd’s death had previously posted bond amounts of USD 750,000 and have been free pending trial. Currently, all four men are scheduled to face trial together in March, but the judge is weighing a request to have them tried separately.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9aj1s4/article32818401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEREK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ex-officer-charged-in-george-floyds-death-freed-on-1-million-bond/article32818404.ece
30,2020/10/10,Donald Trump set to get back on campaign trail,"Biden calls it ‘reckless’; second Trump-Biden debate scrapped, leaving only Oct. 22 event before polls

U.S. President Donald Trump will give a public speech at the White House late on Saturday for the first time since testing positive for COVID-19, as he prepares a rapid return to the campaign trail just three weeks before the election.

Also read: Amid concerns, Donald Trump may campaign on October 10

The 74-year-old commander-in-chief has also announced a Florida rally on Monday in an attempt to relaunch his stumbling re-election campaign against surging Democratic rival Joe Biden, who called the president’s behaviour “reckless.”

Seeking to project strength and improved health, Mr. Trump had refused to participate in next week’s scheduled debate after organisers shifted it to an online format out of coronavirus concerns.

On Friday, the Commission on Presidential Debates made it official, saying next Thursday’s debate is scrapped, leaving an October 22 event — the final Trump-Biden showdown — before election day on November 3.

That prompted accusations of bias from Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh, who said “there is no medical reason to stop” the October 15 debate from proceeding.

Knocked off the campaign trail by his three-night hospitalisation last week, the President is in the midst of a frenetic bid to catch up with Mr. Biden.

On Friday, during an extended media blitz, Mr. Trump falsely claimed that COVID-19 now has a cure.

He also revealed that he’d been told he was near death at the worst of his bout with the virus, which has killed more than 2,13,000 Americans and severely dented his chances of winning a second term.

Saturday’s speech, which a senior administration official said would be on Mr. Trump’s favoured theme of “law and order,” will give him a chance to dispel lingering doubts about his health.

The crowd will be on the South Lawn of the White House, while the President will speak from the balcony.

A source with knowledge of the planning said all attendees will be required to wear masks and have their temperature checked.

Crucial state

On Monday, Mr. Trump will take another major step by holding a rally in a crucial battleground state.

“Will be in Sanford, Florida on Monday for a very BIG RALLY!” Mr. Trump tweeted.

The events come despite continued questions over how sick Mr. Trump was and how complete his recovery is now, with White House officials refusing to answer basic queries, including when the President first contracted the virus and whether he has tested negative since.

After Mr. Trump spent months mocking Mr. Biden for staying at home during the pandemic, it is Mr. Biden who has barnstormed swing States this week.

He visited Arizona on Thursday and campaigned Friday in Nevada. Mr. Trump won both States in 2016 but they are now narrowly tilting Democratic in polls.

At a drive-in style event in Las Vegas, Mr. Biden slammed the President.

“His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis, the destabilising effect it’s having on our government, is unconscionable,” Mr. Biden said.

As he boarded his campaign plane he offered a message for those attending Mr. Trump’s public events: “Good luck. I wouldn’t show up unless you had a mask and were distanced.”

On Friday, Mr. Trump gave a marathon interview to right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh in which he said the experimental Regeneron antibody cocktail that he took as part of therapeutic treatment was “a cure.” It’s “a total game changer.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/aaxpvc/article32817698.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-set-to-get-back-on-campaign-trail/article32817699.ece
31,2020/10/10,Indian-origin Srikant Datar named Dean of Harvard Business School,"An alumnus of University of Bombay and Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, Mr Datar succeeds Nitin Nohria and will assume charge as the school’s next dean on January 1

Eminent Indian-origin academician Srikant Datar has been named as Dean of Harvard Business School, succeeding Nitin Nohria and becoming the second consecutive dean hailing from India to lead the prestigious 112-year-old institution.

Mr Datar, an alumnus of University of Bombay and Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, is the Arthur Lowes Dickinson Professor of Business Administration and the senior associate dean for University Affairs at Harvard Business School (HBS).

He will assume charge as the school’s next dean on January 1, President Larry Bacow said.

Mr Bacow described Mr Datar as an innovative educator, a distinguished scholar, and a deeply experienced academic leader.

He is a leading thinker about the future of business education, and he has recently played an essential role in HBS’s creative response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. He has served with distinction in a range of leadership positions over his nearly 25 years at HBS, while also forging novel collaborations with other Harvard Schools, Mr Bacow said.

Mr Datar said he is in equal measures humbled and honoured to take on the new role.

Harvard Business School is an institution with a remarkable legacy of impact in research, education, and practice. Yet the events of the past year have hastened our passage to an unforeseen future, he said, adding that he looks forward to working with colleagues and friends of the school to realise our mission in what undoubtedly will be an exciting new era.

Mr Datar will become the 11th dean in the business school history. He will succeed Mr Nohria, who last November announced his plans to conclude his deanship at the end of June 2020, after 10 years of service.

Mr Nohria had agreed to continue through this December in view of the pandemic, a statement posted on the Harvard Gazette website said.

Career path

Mr Datar received his bachelor’s degree, with distinction, from the University of Bombay in 1973. A chartered accountant, he went on to receive a postgraduate diploma in business management from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, before completing master’s degrees in statistics and economics and a Ph.D. in business from Stanford University.

From 1984 to 1989, he was an assistant professor and then associate professor at the Carnegie Mellon Graduate School of Industrial Administration, where he was honoured with the George Leland Bach Teaching Award.

From 1989 to 1996, he served on the faculty of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he rose to become the Littlefield Professor of Accounting and Management and was recognised with the school’s Distinguished Teaching Award.

The statement added that as a native of India who has travelled widely on the HBS’s behalf, Mr Datar brings a broad international perspective to his work.

He has presented his research to audiences of academics and executives in North America, South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe.

He has led discussions and workshops on management education on several continents, has written numerous papers and cases focused on enterprises based abroad, and is faculty co-chair of the HBS Senior Executive Program—Africa, which was launched in 2016 and has since offered programs for executives in South Africa, Rwanda, Ghana, and Mauritius.

He also serves on the governing body of the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta.

The statement said that since joining the HBS faculty in 1996, Mr Datar has held a series of key positions, as the school’s senior associate dean responsible for faculty recruiting, for faculty development, for executive education, for research, and currently for University affairs.

He has served since 2015 as faculty chair of the Harvard Innovation Labs, or i-lab. Most recently, he has been intensively engaged in envisioning and implementing the innovative hybrid teaching and learning model that HBS has adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the statement said.

Mr Bacow added that Mr Datar will come to the deanship with a broad international perspective, decades of close engagement with business practice, and a strong commitment to building an increasingly diverse and inclusive HBS community.

“He is also a warm, generous, and thoughtful colleague and mentor — someone whose leadership experience, intimate knowledge of HBS, deep devotion to the institution, and talent for catalysing constructive change all promise to serve the School and the University well, at a pivotal moment for business education.”

Mr Nohria said Mr Datar is an outstanding choice as Harvard Business School’s next dean and he has thought deeply about the challenges and opportunities facing management education, and has a proven record of collaboration, innovation, and leadership — not only within HBS, but across Harvard and at other organisations.

Co-author of several books, Mr Datar played a key role in launching both the M.S.-M.B.A. in biotechnology and life sciences (with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Medical School) and the M.S.-M.B.A. in engineering sciences (with the Harvard Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences) joint degree programs.

Mr Datar currently serves on the boards of companies such as Novartis and T-Mobile US.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/r52vo8/article32817530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DATAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indian-origin-srikant-datar-named-dean-of-harvard-business-school/article32817531.ece
32,2020/10/10,Congress includes dissenting leaders in Bihar campaign,"Of the 243 Assembly seats, the Congress is contesting 70 seats in an alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Left parties.

The Congress on Saturday sent a list of 30 star campaigners to the Election Commission (EC) for the first phase of the Bihar Assembly polls. The list includes leaders who had questioned the party’s leadership through a letter in August.

The list, issued by general secretary K.C. Venugopal, included Rajya Sabha MP Ghulam Nabi Azad, Akhilesh Prasad Singh and Raj Babbar, who were part of Group of 23 who had questioned the leadership, as well Sachin Pilot who had rebelled against Rajashthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.

Apart from Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, former party chief Rahul Gandhi, general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the names include film-star-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha, former cricketer and MP Kirti Azad and popular Urdu poet Imran Pratapgarhi.

Other senior leaders who have been mentioned in the list include Meira Kumar, Randeep Surjewala and Nikhil Kumar among others.

Ms. Gandhi and Dr. Singh, however, are unlikely to travel to Bihar in the midst of the pandemic and the party may instead opt for digital rallies for them.

The former party chief is likely to be principal campaigner for the Congress even though Mr. Gandhi’s election tour programme is yet to be finalized, said a source.

Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled States including Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Ashok Gehlot (Rajasthan), Bhupesh Baghel (Chhattisgarh) will also be part of the opposition campaign.

Of the 243 Assembly seats in the State, the Congress is contesting 70 seats in an alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Left parties. The RJD is leading the coalition and will field candidates in 144 seats.

The Congress has, so far, announced only 21 names. The party’s central election committee will meet on Monday to finalise names for the remaining 49 seats.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/ny41jy/article32822974.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SACHINPILOT,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/bihar-assembly/congress-includes-dissenting-leaders-in-bihar-campaign/article32822975.ece
33,2020/10/10,‘Nagabhairavi’ takes you on a fantasy path from October 12,"The extravagant saga on Zee Telugu presents the efforts of two individuals to save ‘nagasampada’

If you like fantasy tales, here’s something on television to distract your mind from the stress of pandemic. Zee Telugu’s new serial Nagabhairavi is the saga of two individuals and their fight to save ‘nagasampada’. Highlighted by VFX extravaganza, the show is set to go on air from October 12

Shot in Nagavaram village near Andhra Pradesh and Hyderabad, the show chronicles the story of Nagarjuna (enacted by Pawon Sae) and Bhairavi (Yashmi Gowda). The onus of securing the legacy of Nagasampada is upon Bhairavi, as it has been passed on to her through ancestors. Lord Shiva blesses Bhairavi with a divine amulet and when her life is in danger, Nagarjuna is her only protector. The story depicts how the two fight all odds to secure Nagasampada and how courage, grit and determination are weapons to fight the evil.

Set in the present-day aesthetics, the show traverses a mystical and enigmatic world showing how the poison bearers struggle to attain the Nagasampada. The cast also includes Kalki Raja, Ashwini and Sravani. Interestingly, actors Pawon and Kalki have turned producers for the first time with this project.

Says actor-turned-producer Kalki Raja, “Nagabhairavi is my baby; we believe the show’s visual effects and presentation are of a different dimension and hope it will appeal to all members in a family.” Pawon considers Nagabharavi an opportunity to fulfil his dreams to be a producer.

Versatile actress Ramya Krishnan is the show’s brand ambassador. According to a release, the promo and title song featuring her have already created a buzz.

34,2020/10/10,The lockdown food factory,"A family has been providing the poor and the homeless with free food and safety kits

Every year, 79-year-old N. Chandramouli, his seven brothers and their families don’t miss participating in the Kapaleeshwar temple car festival in Mylapore. They have been following the tradition of serving food to the poor who attend the festival. The food is cooked by their three cooks.

The brothers were getting ready for the festival this year, when it was going to be held in April, and they had kept the stocks in their kitchen. And then the first lockdown came into effect in March, cancelling the temple car festival. But the lockdown restrictions did not stop them from continuing with the tradition of serving the poor. They have been providing them with free food for 156 days between April and September, on the trot. Along with the food, safety kits were also distributed. And, they still continue .

“We saw many poor people struggling to manage one square meal a day, and so with some support from our friends and relatives in the city and elsewhere we mobilised funds to serve the poor in the neighbourhood during the lockdown,” says 56-year-old N. Vidyanathan, the youngest among the eight brothers.

With the three cooks — Kannan, Krishnan and Kumar at their house on Mathala Narayanan Street near the Jain temple, off Kutchery Road, Mylapore — they divide the work the previous evening.

While the work of buying vegetables from the Broadway market and chopping them into varying sizes are carried out by the younger brothers and their children; washing the vegetables, rice and cooking them are done by the cooks and the women in the family. The menu includes sambar rice, vada, curd rice and sweets and a 200 ml water bottle.

“Many neighbours supported and helped us continue the free food distribution during the lockdown; some shared our roles and a few others shopped for vegetables at the Broadway market. Many others contributed monetarily,” says N. Pattabi, another brother.

Between noon and 2 p.m every day, the brothers and their children, along with a handful of neighbours, visit key roads and intersections in Mylapore, Luz Corner, Mandavali, Santhome, Royapettah and Foreshore Estate to distribute food packets to the needy.

Close to 1,200 persons including 300 frontline workers, mainly conservancy staff of the Greater Chennai Corporation were also provided with food on all days including Sundays. The brothers also gave 20,000 free safety kits which included face masks, gloves and hand sanitisers. With the easing of lockdown restrictions by the State government, the brothers have only slowed down the service, and not stopped it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/5ha5oq/article32821535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11DCBROTHERS,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-lockdown-food-factory/article32821536.ece
35,2020/10/10,Should schools take lessons from corporates on wellness?,"How institutions can help their students cope with challenges arising out of the pandemic

In 2020, amidst a pandemic that has left the corporate world largely working from makeshift, often ergonomically-challenged home offices, Elton Mayo has resurfaced. Mayo’s work in the first half of the twentieth century traced the link between the social side of work — to grab a ready example, the two-minute banter around the water-cooler on that hanging corridor — and organisational health. The pandemic has underlined the significance his theory holds for employee wellness.

Organisations now seek to virtually recreate the social side of work. So, you have colleagues sipping coffee together, parked at Google Meet, Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Non-work activities are offered virtually to help employees keep their sanity intact.

It is probably equally necessary to recreate the “social side of learning” for students, as they continue to “study from home” with some slipping further into the bog of gadget dependence.

“We plan online classes in such a way that children have time to share their daily experiences, interact with their peers and also have some physical exercise. We also plan for a few classes where we all have lunch or snacks together virtually. That way children feel connected with their peers and teachers,” says Abirami .P, counselling psychologist and facilitator-and-counselor at HLC International School in Karanai, off Old Mahabalipuram Road.

Communication strategy

Due to the challenges resulting from the work-from-home arrangement and from the pandemic itself, corporates encourage their leaders to practise “overcommunication” with their teams so that they can lead with greater empathy.

The study-from-home arrangement obviously requires a similar communication approach from teachers.

Peer-level interactions and increased points of contact with teachers are now more necessary than ever before, because challenges are steadily on the rise, states Malathi Karthiban, chief counsellor, Adarsh Student Counselling Centre, which primarily caters to students of five schools and one college in Chennai that come under the Punjab Association. (On account of COVID-19, it has extended its tele-counselling service to children and even adults outside)

Malathi points out that the grown-ups in a child’s world, including teachers, should engage children in conversations that can reveal coping difficulties.

“There is a world of difference between the concerns children raised at the beginning of the pandemic and now. Earlier, it would largely be academics-related. Now, emotional problems surface more frequently. Aware of COVID-19 deaths in their friends’ circles, some children fear for the safety of their family members, especially the elderly among them. There is much information about COVID-19 out there for the older children to figure out who would be at high risk for complications from the disease. Where younger children are concerned, the problem often stems from an inability to process the situation correctly. It is not unusual for us to come across little children who feel neglected because they are not allowed to step out of their room. With their inability to process the complexities of human existence, let alone the peculiarities of a pandemic, little children tend to equate ‘being quarantined’ on account of a Coronavirus infection with rejection. When a child runs a temperature, it is possible to attempt to persuade them to stay confined in a room and take rest. When the child has tested positive for the virus and is asymptomatic, they have trouble processing isolation measures,” elaborates Malathi.

“In these five schools, teachers now set aside two after-school hours every day — between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. — for non-academic interactions with the children of the class they handle, via a WhatsApp group. There is scope for interaction through this group during the weekends too. Teachers are expected to encourage children to discuss their day and anxieties, if any. If there is something personal to be shared, the child would be encouraged to have a one-on-one interaction. At this time, only online intervention is possible and we try to make the most of what is possible,” explains Malathi and points out that teachers of the five schools exchange notes on what works and does not in terms of making the online classes less tiresome for the children.

“One of the striking shifts in focus is that the classes now begin with compliments, claps and ice-breakers,” adds Malathi.

The family on board

Another takeaway from corporates during the pandemic is how they engaged with the employee’s family, particularly in the early part of the lockdown when they kept their employees’ children engaged through online contests and educative sessions.

To give two examples, Prione, which provides technology support services to SMBs, got these children to design sunglasses under a programme called ‘Parents of Prione’. Temenos, a banking software solutions provider, reportedly ran an online soft skills training programme for its employees’ children. Schools could look at organising programmes that would get the student’s family on board.

“We have conducted two online programmes engaging the entire family. One was a seven-day programme on gratitude, which encouraged parents to teach their children how to be grateful for the good things in their life, by first practising gratefulness themselves. We felt a need for this programme as the pandemic had led people to take a dim view of their own lives. The families were taught to be grateful not just for the things they had, but also for the things that they lacked and also for the things in their house they no longer had any need for. This way, they were being encouraged to recycle these things by offering them to people who may need them.

“The second programme was ‘Lockdown Camp’ in which we called the WhatsApp group, ‘Fun Room’ where every member of the family was being taught life skills,” says Malathi.

“We have started our third programme which is a self-care programme for our teachers and it covers the physical, psychological, spiritual, financial and professional aspects of their lives.”

Abirami believes that if interventions that activate peer-level interactions are not engineered now, when the pandemic is over, students would struggle switching to the old in-person learning environment.

In a sense, children are like astronauts on a prolonged stay in space — in this case, it is online space — who would have to make some adjustments as they start living as earthlings again. Abirami says the weaning-off should happen when they are still online. However, the process has to be gently administered.

Says Abirami, “The focus should not be only on academics, but also on emotional well-being. We don’t know in what ways children would have been affected during this time.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/k73bgn/article32821483.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11DCCHILD,https://www.thehindu.com/society/should-schools-take-lessons-from-corporates-on-wellness/article32821484.ece
36,2020/10/10,Why are we permanently anxious?,"Perhaps we are all anxious because no matter how hard we scroll, how incessantly we post, and how intently we binge-watch, we do not have the capacity to deny the state of the world

Has anybody else that has the luxury of home and hearth in these times experienced increased instances of anxiety? The feeling that every new day will bring a new disaster and a new unforeseen event, the contours of which could neither have been predicted nor controlled? Open the newspaper any given day of the week or listen to your favourite news anchor screaming their heads off at yet another hapless invitee, depending on your poison, and you will probably have more fodder to fuel such a feeling.

WebMD tells me that anxiety is a normal emotion. And that it’s a way of alerting the brain to potential danger and a standard reaction to stress. But when all that I consume every day is meant to create the feeling of potential danger, is it a wonder that I am permanently anxious?

Online threat

The Social Dilemma on Netflix makes the compelling argument that online platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are meant to nurture this addiction to anxiety and affect my mental health. A recent debate organised by NDTV and Roli Books argued the motion, ‘In a democracy, social media does more harm than good.’ Proponents for the motion cited the rise of hatred, bigotry, fake news, and violence of both the online and offline kind. Those against argued for the role of social media in the amplification of dissent, resistance and the voices of the marginalised in society.

Sociologist and Marxist writer Richard Seymour’s book The Twittering Machine suggests instead that it would be easier to ask as to what is wrong with us rather than what is wrong with these systems.

And he makes the perhaps controversial argument that compulsive participation in social media, whether as participant, spectator or addict to the dopamine loops of ‘likes’ and ‘retweets’ is not due to a need for pleasure but a symptom of the death drive, a giving in to the chronophage or the “monster that eats time.”

In other words, we stay online to pass time, for real time in the real world is fraught and cannot be passed so easily.

When I was a child, I was in thrall to that allay-er of all anxieties, the institution of the bedtime story. Through familiar parables of good and evil, offered in turn by my maternal grandfather, my father and my mother, I was offered the possibility of a world in which one could thrive, but of course, only if one followed the rules.

Bedtime fiction

Today my phone and social media keep me company before bedtime. Whatsapp forwards and Twitter and Facebook propel me into the fiction that both the good and the bad are constantly elsewhere; somebody else is always happier, better-looking, and travelling to nicer places and somebody else is constantly cruel, inhuman, illiberal, and brutal.

At the same time, they also contrarily inform me that all happiness is within my reach whether through re-invention of self, new hobbies, Instagram-influencing, or follower-gathering. So then, in this moment and this space, I ask again, is it a wonder that we are all permanently anxious?

But maybe there is a way to elide this Manichean back and forth of social media by focusing on anxiety as a symptom to revisit the question of what may be wrong with us.

Philosopher Renata Salecl in her beautiful exploration ‘On Anxiety’ is wary of the popular account that anxiety is an obstacle to well-being and prevents us from functioning in the world or engaging with others. Instead, she says that a world without anxiety would be a scary place for it would give truth to the lie that happiness is freely available, and that we are not in an age of cruelty, misery and danger.

Perhaps we are all anxious because no matter how hard we scroll, how incessantly we post, and how intently we binge-watch, we do not have the capacity to deny the state of the world. To rephrase anthropologist Clifford Geertz, we are unable to believe the stories we are telling ourselves about ourselves. Anxiety in this case can be a powerful space to stay in and to ask about the stories we no longer tell, and perhaps even to find newer, better and kinder stories of the world.

38,2020/10/10,How one school teacher’s efforts has helped girls from rural Bihar make it big in sports,"Sanjay Pathak’s club has earned the distinction of having sent several girls from Siwan district to national and State-level tournaments

Sanjay Pathak is a 45-year-old geography teacher at a government school in Bihar’s Siwan district. In his spare time, he also takes it upon himself to give sports training to the children in his school.

In 2009, when two girls from his school — Tara Khatun and Putul Kumari, both 11 — bagged gold medals in athletics at the Panchayat Yuva Khel Abhiyan in the 800m, 1,500m, 100m, and 200m races, Pathak not only discovered two sporting stars in the district, he also became acutely aware of the dismal lack of institutional support and sporting opportunities for such talent in rural areas.

“When I saw the medals around their necks, I realised the potential in these girls from Siwan’s villages,” says Pathak. So, in 2016, Pathak cleared up the paddy crop growing on some ancestral land he owned in Laxmipur village and set up the Rani Laxmibai sports club.

The club has since earned the distinction of having sent several girls from Siwan to national and State-level tournaments. “Although I am not a sports teacher, I decided I would hone these students’ sporting skills and help them reach international levels.”

Four years on, 25 girls from his club have played at the State and national levels in games such as hockey, rugby, football, handball, athletics, and ball badminton. Eight girls have represented India at international tournaments in football, handball and throwball.

But it was no cakewalk. The girls were routinely harassed. . “Young boys would trespass the ground, throw bottles, and play vulgar Bhojpuri songs.” Village elders taunted the teacher for allowing girls to play in shorts.

Not only did Pathak break patriarchal taboos, he also challenged caste-based discrimination. | Photo Credit: WASIMUL HAQUE & TANWEER AHMED

Pathak’s own school staff criticised him, neighbours and relatives hounded the parents. “But I was determined to fight. I used to clean up everything the next morning and start again,” he says. The response from the girls was enormous. Soon, Pathak convinced their parents to allow them to come for training after school hours. And to stay in the hostel in his club.

Not only did Pathak break patriarchal taboos, he also challenged caste-based discrimination. Dalit students are not allowed to mingle with other castes but Pathak ensures that everyone sits and eats together in his home and school. “Parents are not asked questions about religion and caste,” he says.

Village pride

From dawn to dusk, some 100 girls practise every day at the club, which is a little smaller than a football ground and surrounded by green paddy fields. The day I visit, the sun is setting and its orange beam lights up a bunch of girls playing handball. Many of the skills that Pathak uses to train them he has picked up from YouTube.

Villagers watch from the edges of the field. I ask Jainarayan Singh, 46, about Pathak’s vision. Singh smiles: “Initially Pathakji’s dream sounded like madness to us, but now we all are very happy with his initiative. We are proud of the girls’ achievement because their victories have become international news, and the club is also a matter of pride for our village, district and State.”

“The best thing,” says Pathak, “is that these village girls adopted the spirit of sports despite the lack of a sporting atmosphere. I believe they also wanted to be financially self-reliant.”

Radha Kumari won a gold medal in handball at the national level in 2016. Today, she works as a sports teacher in a private school and has become her family’s sole bread-earner after her father’s death. Says her mother, Ramavati Devi, “Zila ka naam raushan kar rahi hai, aur hum iske saath hai (She is bringing glory to the district, we support her).” Sporting success has also helped many girls from underprivileged backgrounds to land that coveted government job. .

Tara and Putul have also played for Bihar in U-16 football, and Putul was selected for the national women’s team in 2011. Several of Pathak’s students are now part of the Bihar handball team, while a few have made it to the national team.

In athletics, Antima Kumari, 14, won gold in the national school games in the 100m race and Usha Kumari bagged silver in the 400m race in the tournament held at Haridwar in 2015. Amrita Kumari has represented India in the U-14 and U-16 teams at the Asian Football Confederation Cup, while Nisha Kumari was part of the U-14 in 2014 and 2016.

Super Salma

Salma Khatun, also known as the P.T. Usha of Siwan, has won several medals in school and State games. Her father Sudhan Ansari says that when his older daughter Tara started playing, relatives and friends criticised him for allowing her to play, and that too in shorts. “I did not listen to them; I believed that my family was my strength,” says Ansari, who repairs tyres for a living. “Today I am very happy. My daughter was doing better than my sons and so I sent my two younger daughters also to Pathak’s club.” Tara now has a job in Indian Railways.

Pathak even taught his students beach handball, coaching them to reach the State and national levels. For practice, they would travel to Patna, some 150 km away from Siwan, to play on the banks of the Ganges. Now, he has started to make an artificial sand ground in the village.

No gym, no trainers, not even a proper ground, but that does not stop Sanjay Pathak and his trainees, mostly girls from disadvantaged backgrounds, from giving it their all at the Rani Laxmibai sports club in Siwan, Bihar. | Photo Credit: WASIMUL HAQUE & TANWEER AHMED

B.K. Sharma, the secretary general of the Bihar Handball Association, laments the negligence of sport by the State and Central governments. “The government sometimes allocates meagre funds to a few players doing extremely well,” he says. “But look at Haryana — it spends money on players and even provides some job security. If Bihar can also do this, it is obvious players will do well.”

Pathak’s success comes despite the lack of state support. His club does not have even basic infrastructure — no gym, no trainers, not even a proper ground. The one-room hostel houses 20 girls, with the older girls cooking for them all in a small adjoining kitchen. He is also aware that their diet is poor. “They should get at least four slices of bread, jam, butter, two bananas and an egg for breakfast but I can only provide dalia in the morning and egg once a week,” he says. “Sometimes I worry if I am harming these girls because they don’t get the nutrition they need.”

Pathak spends 25% of his salary to run the academy. But that’s not enough for food, kits, travel and school fees for residential students. Villagers and well-wishers have come forward with funding. A school called Bloombuds is one of Pathak’s biggest sponsors. Pathak’s eyes gleam with hope, “If I can give my students proper diets, a gym and other training facilities, they could win an Olympic medal.”

Says Nisha, who has represented India in football in Nepal and Tajikistan, “A lot of people compare Pathak sir with the Dangal film coach Mahavir Singh Phogat; but our coach is very different. Phogat wanted to achieve his dream through his daughter but our Sir has helped us achieve our dreams without imposing anything on us.”

And what is Pathak’s dream? “I want to start a trust like Mohun Bagan [Football Club] and bring in people from other States as well. The academy should keep growing even after I am gone.”

39,2020/10/10,The dissent of Shaheen Bagh was visible and non-violent: Romila Thapar,"The historian traces the long history of dissent and questioning in India and their centrality in shaping civilisations

In her new book, Voices of Dissent: An Essay, eminent historian Romila Thapar explores the larger context of dissent, in various forms and at different times, in the Indian past, and relates it to the fractious present. She discusses here the necessity of questioning the world we live in. Excerpts:

How have dissent, disagreement and difference of opinion contributed to creating new idioms and building civilisations?

Let me explain it with an example: major dissent arose when various sects of Shramanas — Buddhists, Jainas, Ajivikas in particular — expressed disagreement with the premises of Vedic Brahmanism and questioned some of the theories it promoted. For instance, they questioned the belief in deity, the Vedas being divinely revealed, and the efficacy of the sacrificial ritual. Thus, a dichotomy came about between the believers and the non-believers. The Brahmanas referred to the Shramanas as nastikas — non-believers. I try to show in the book that these two became parallel streams of belief.

The major institution of the Shramanas — the monk-renouncer and the monastery — was new to society. Other religions were also inspired by the idea of establishing institutions that would enhance religion but also play a social role. How religions controlled societies through institutions becomes apparent through the history of viharas, temples, ashramas, khanqahs and gurdwaras, as well as through charting the patronage to each. These were both places of worship and institutions exercising social control.

A 16th-century CE Sanskrit text segregates the Shramanas and the Turushkas — a term used for Muslims — into a joint nastika category, and labels them mleccha. The recognition by those well-established in society of others who did not agree with them is an excellent example of dissent. New questions are asked, new institutions are founded and new forms of patronage emerge. The social process can encourage dissenting groups to become orthodoxies. Religion is not limited to a laudable body of texts; it also shapes society and is shaped by it, attracting dissent.

Can there be any advancement in knowledge without questioning the world we live in?

No. Disallowing questions is a way of destabilising society and dismantling institutions.

That dissent was an essential component of civilisation is evident from the histories of civilisations. They register a high point in philosophical thinking, new visible forms, new literature. This process draws on questioning what is known — accumulations from the past — and providing creative solutions.

It was earlier thought that civilisations advanced in isolation. Now we know to the contrary that cultures tend to be porous. The cutting edge of knowledge requires extensive interaction across civilisations. For example, in the late first millennium CE, there began an impressive exchange of knowledge among astronomers and mathematicians across Eurasia. This encouraged new questions with improved explanations, often leading to new technologies that introduced social change. The astrolabe for instance, was invented as a result of questioning, and it eased maritime navigation, which in turn impacted trade in Eurasia.

Should voices of non-violent dissent, like those of the women of Shaheen Bagh, be more audible? Why does it remind you of Gandhi?

Voices of dissent are more powerful if there is no accompanying violence, to prevent the dissent being dismissed along with the violence. Violence, whatever its source, breeds terror and escalates into uncontrollable disaster. Dissenters generally draw on moral authority rather than violence. When those representing the state lose their moral authority, they may resort to violence in trying to silence dissent. We faced it in the time of the Emergency. Many ask whether it is surfacing again.

I think of the 11 ‘activists’ accused of inciting riots in association with the Bhima-Koregaon meeting, nine of whom were jailed two years ago; a few more have joined them now. There has been no trial. There is no habeas corpus. They were not present at the site and gave no public speeches. They worked a long distance away in support of social justice where required. Yet, others known to make public speeches urging their audience to shoot dead the citizens of a particular religious identity remain untouched by the same upholders of authority. Discrimination breeds greater fear of authority.

You ask me why today I am reminded of Gandhi and his times and consequently of my youth. Fear of authority evokes earlier occasions. Gandhi and the other leaders had to dispel people’s fear of the British Raj. They provided an alternative way for people to assert their presence in the form of satyagraha. We used to attend the public meetings of anti-colonial nationalists. I still thrill to the slogans that resounded at these meetings — ‘inquilab zindabad’ and ‘le ke rahenge azadi’. Dissent had to have visibility, but had to be non-violent. The dissent of Shaheen Bagh was visible and non-violent.

How did colonialism impact religion?

The colonial formulation of Hinduism and Islam differs from the pre-modern. All except the Muslims and Christians were thrown together as Hindus. The history of Hinduism was constructed as a harmonious whole functioning as a uniform monolithic religion. That the experience of religion may have evolved differently in India, articulating a rich diversity of belief and commitment, and incorporating links between caste and sect, was given little attention. That the cultures of India had variant belief systems that were attuned to this diversity, and whose richness lay in how it was negotiated, accommodated or set aside, was not of central interest. Now this colonial reconstruction has taken deeper root with the attempt to reformulate Hinduism as Hindutva, an ideology that moulds the religion to suit a political agenda, namely to legitimise a Hindu Rashtra.

How have you not let uncertainties overwhelm you?

I have to keep reminding myself that there was a time when we were a society with a strong sense of ethics and a concern with the human condition — implicitly to make it better for every one of us. This comes through in remembered conversations since the last half-century, or even as recently as a few years ago. Dialogues on these matters ensured their primacy. We now live in a different world. The violence of the herd is at our fingertips, notions of justice are conditioned by expediency, the tentacles of corruption capture the law. In these uncertain times, I turn to the perspective of the long duration of the past to justify my faith in the future. We have a long lineage of persons who have argued that love should replace hatred and that compassion should disallow violence in all social behaviour. Today, these have become the voices of dissent. But whatever the future, may these voices continue to be heard.",,https://www.thehindu.com/society/eaedkm/article32813550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11SM-Romila-Thaparartx,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-dissent-of-shaheen-bagh-was-visible-and-non-violent-romila-thapar/article32813551.ece

41,2020/10/10,The Indian modern and contemporary art market is flourishing even during the pandemic,"While the economy has tanked during the pandemic, Indian art has not only flourished, it has set record prices

On September 3, 2020, a new record was set in the Indian art world. A 1974 untitled V.S. Gaitonde oil was auctioned by Pundole’s in Mumbai for ₹32 crore. The unnamed international buyer bought the 60x40 inch work remotely, over the phone, in what is fast becoming the norm in these times of pandemic.

The art belonged to the Glenbarra Art Museum in Japan, owned by businessman and collector Masanori Fukuoka who has one of the largest collections of modern Indian art. It broke the record variously held by another Gaitonde that fetched ₹29.3 crore at a Christie’s auction in Mumbai in 2015; Raza’s Tapovan, which fetched ₹29.03 crore at another Christie’s auction held in New York in 2018; and by Amrita Sher-Gil’s The Little Girl in Blue that fetched ₹18.6 crore at a New York auction in 2015.

The Pundole’s sale is only one of several successful online auctions of 2020. In an economy that has largely suffered during the pandemic, the Indian modern and contemporary art market has not only flourished, it has set record prices compared to previous years.

200 online auctions

According to Ishrat Kanga, Deputy Director and Specialist, Head of Sale at Sotheby’s London, the first half of 2020 has seen $575 million in private art sales worldwide, up by 10% from last year.

Art, was in London on September 29, and featured 16 unpublished works, including pieces by Gaitonde and Ram Kumar as well as Bhupen Khakhar’s 1971 Portrait of Shri Shankerbhai V. Patel Near Red Fort. The last was estimated at ₹4.3 crore and sold for ₹19.17 crore. Khakhar, of course, had a huge exhibition at Tate Modern in 2016, lending more visibility to not just the artist but to Indian art in general in the U.K.

An important aspect at this juncture, as much as the quantum of sales, is the audience adapting to the changing ways in which art is now viewed. “We have held almost 200 online auctions so far in 2020, four times the number last year. And 88% of all bidders at Sotheby’s in the first half of 2020 were online, over a third of the online buyers were new patrons, and over 25% of our buyers worldwide were under 40,” says Kanga.

Art as comfort

Last month, artist Waswo X. Waswo had an online party and artist walkthrough, followed by a Q&A, for the opening of his new show at Gallery Latitude 28 in New Delhi. The audience, he says, was global. “A lot of sales happen during the opening, when people meet each other and in the general euphoria, ask gallery owners to save artworks for them. That’s not happening now. So, we held an online opening, and more than a hundred people joined in, from Pakistan, Switzerland, Delhi and Goa.”

S.H. Raza’s ‘Tapovan’, which fetched ₹29.03 crore | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

In August, Kolkata’s Victoria Memorial Hall and New Delhi’s DAG Museums jointly organised ‘An Inheritance of Imaginations’, one of the largest online exhibitions where, probably for the first time, a vast selection of paintings by Rabindranath Tagore and Gaganendranath, Abanindranath and Sunayani Devi Tagore was displayed and discussed.

The positive response to online viewings and auctions has taken artists and gallerists alike by surprise. Says Roshni Vadehra, director of Vadehra Art Gallery in New Dehi, “We thought it would be extremely challenging to convince people to buy art during such uncertain times, but the response has been quite amazing. One reason could be that people are at home. They’re not spending on vacations, so they spend on art or they look at art as a source of comfort.”

No government support

Galleries are also going out of their way to connect with collectors. ‘In Touch’ is an online collaboration between 10 galleries in India and Dubai, where they pool exhibitions, knowledge, audiences and share prices. Another collective of 15 galleries has come together on a platform called TAP India, started by Sharan Apparao of Chennai’s Apparao Galleries, to hold exhibitions, talks and online events once a month. Vadehra Art Gallery and Nature Morte in Delhi have refurbished their online shops and Sotheby’s has added a ‘Buy Now’ section on its website.

The buoyancy in sales, however, doesn’t benefit all artists equally. As Apparao points out, “For every hundred artists, only three succeed. Some have been forced to sell their works cheap because they are not like galleries or collectors who have a cushion.” Waswo, who works with miniature artists in Udaipur, concurs. “I have told the artists who work with me that I can pay them for 12-18 months but other miniature artists, who supply to tourist shops, are selling tea to feed their families.”

There is also the matter of non-existent government support. Unlike many other countries, in India, there are no tax breaks or subsidies for artists and craftsmen. Art attracts some of the highest taxes at 12% GST and an import duty of nearly 15%. Apparao says there are many ways in which both the government and collectors can help build up the art market. “It’s not only about sales,” she says. “You’re also talking of collectors building up a base of educational information and about government infrastructure. About more courses, common platforms for performing arts, and government help to struggling artists.”

The ways in which the art fraternity has banded together to create new ways to sell art during the pandemic, as well as the unexpected jump in art sales, are great gains. Ideally, this learning should be used as a springboard by the fraternity to adapt and innovate in other ways as well.

42,2020/10/10,The many blinkered kings,"The tyrants know, but haven’t digested, that history has a way of dealing with despots that is rarely kind

Watching the ‘debate’ between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, two grown men vying to be elected to the position of the most powerful man on earth, I was taken back to the school playground. Trump kept up a constant dribble of interruptions, comments, insults, rejoinders of the level of an eight-year-old. The rules set for the debate didn’t matter, Trump talked and snarled over, under and across both Biden and the helpless moderator.

Immediate gratification

As an adult, it can be very difficult to face this kind of brainless barrage, whether it comes from a political opponent or a crazed news anchor. If you maintain civility or keep quiet, you’ll be seen as having no answers to the accusations being thrown at you; if you retaliate you will be seen as being no different from the person doing the bullying. It’s a nasty trap and some learn how to set it very early. If it yields results, they refine the manoeuvre and deploy it repeatedly as adults.

Usually, however, if a person is president or prime minister of a nation, he or she has an awareness not only of the immediate audience but also of the whole world looking on; they have some sense not only of the immediate moment but also of posterity, of how their words, tone and behaviour might be viewed later on. A juvenile shouting and baiting has no sense of these things — he just wants the immediate gratification of entrapping and destroying his opponent. The man who has managed to become president of the U.S. displayed exactly this greed for instant, fleeting triumph. Or perhaps the subconscious aim was not for a momentary victory but something more long-term; perhaps Trump was addressing not only his core base but also other gullible voters who he imagined would see Biden as weak and indecisive in the face of his assault.

Trump is hardly the only current political leader unconcerned about the international community as witness or about the verdict of posterity. This absence of concern is usually found in men crippled by an extremely narrow world view and a very poor sense of history. Tragically for us in India, we seem to have reached a critical mass of such ignorant, power-drunk men who have captured or risen to positions of authority.

So the district magistrate and police officer who execute the scandalous cremation of a brutally murdered rape victim do not care that the world may see them as criminals conniving with their political bosses. The investigative agencies concocting evidence and jailing people who are critical of the regime don’t care that their names will join the long list of organisations infamous for torturing their own people. The chief minister who hires a top PR firm to concoct laughable ‘international conspiracy’ theories doesn’t understand that people across the country and the world see through the masquerade.

Propped up

The officials who freeze the accounts of Amnesty International do not realise that they are reducing their country’s reputation to that of some dictator-run banana republic. The men who engage in the craziest legal contortions — saying, for example, that while the breaking down of a historic structure is a crime, the land it stood on should still be handed over to those who broke it down — seem unconcerned that the country’s once renowned judicial system will stand exposed as shamefully subservient.

Nor does this worthy foot-soldier, the one who waves a wand to disappear huge volumes of publicly seen evidence to acquit the self-proclaimed perpetrators, understand that he will go down in history as the worst kind of hollow puppet. The amoral men controlling these officials are seriously impaired in their vision and they pass their blindness down to their vassals, constantly infecting them with their own cowardice.

The blindered men at the top depend on their counterparts in other countries, all of them propping one another up, either as allies or in counterbalancing, co-toxic opposition. For instance, the man targeting the Uighurs counts on the man bombing the Kurds who counts on the man mass-imprisoning the Kashmiris who counts on the man targeting the Palestinians who depends on the man demonising the Mexicans.

All these men know, but haven’t digested, that history has a way of dealing with despots that is rarely kind. And when the end comes, no amount of lying and bullying and passing the blame will work.

43,2020/10/10,Tata Communications bets on three-pronged approach for growth in post-Covid world,"Tata Communications is betting on three opportunities that a cautious approach by clients to the pandemic has thrown up, to drive growth. “Our network and security experience will help enable work-from-anywhere for an enterprise employee; our digital expertise will enable e-commerce and video collaboration for superior digital engagement for B2C customers; and our connected ecosystem will allow our enterprises to connect virtually with their vendor ecosystem in the B2B domain,” said Srinivasan C.R., Chief Digital Officer, Tata Communications.

“Our historical presence in the network space now combines with the expertise we have acquired in the digital space,” he said. “Work from home is a reality that could stay with us well after the virus disappears. Employees have to work while remaining safe but effectively and without a let up in tech security.”

“The second opportunity emerges from the business-to-consumer segement. For example, when a prospective buyer is considering purchase of a vehicle but does not want to touch a piece of equipment that someone else has probably touched... he or she wants to avoid infection... How can an automotive company demonstrate a product, and get the customer to bring in his/her family on a video call, via a live video to a showroom and get a feel for the device virtually? With our solutions targeted at the business-to-consumer segment, we can deliver the experience of having a bonnet or the door opened for a particular view. The focus of online commerce solutions would be the customer satisfaction with the virtual experience our solutions allow us to offer.”

The third area of focus, Mr. Srinivasan said, was to enable a supply chain ecosystem to function without the touch-and-feel that was common before the pandemic. “Earlier, you would have a face-to-face meeting with your partners, get them into a room and talk to them. Now, you can't do that. How do you get them to connect effectively to your network and exchange information that they would have otherwise done via in-person meetings? Managing the supply chain in the post-Covid scenario where things will remain permanently changed for some companies is an area of opportunity for us.”

According to Mr. Srinivasan, Tata Communications’ suite of offerings that constitute its Secure Connected Digital Experience (SCDx), will allow the company to play in all three areas.

On adding capacity, Mr. Srinivasan said that the company had continued to invest in infrastructure. “About 30% of the world’s Internet traverses our routes and we have kept pace with the demand.” He added that the company’s overall capital expenditure for FY20 had been ₹1,596 crore.

Virgin Hyperloop has set up a global Hyperloop Certification Centre (HCC) in West Virginia in the U.S., and the company said it was a major step towards accelerating its safe-mobility projects around the globe, including those in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Punjab.

“The significance of this milestone cannot be overstated. This brings the hyperloop project, connecting Mumbai to Pune to under 25 minutes – and others around the world – one step closer to reality,” said Jay Walder, CEO of Virgin Hyperloop.

The certification centre will enable global regulatory bodies to work with the U.S. federal authorities to establish and set global safety and industry standards for the hyperloop, which can subsequently be adopted and re-applied in other geographies, according to Mr. Walder.

As per Virgin Hyperloop, the opening of this centre builds significant progress around the world on the regulatory front. This global regulatory momentum, combined with the advancements at the HCC, will pave the way for the certification of hyperloop systems around the world – the first step towards commercial projects, including those in India.

It may be recalled that Maharashtra has already deemed hyperloop as a public infrastructure project and approved the Virgin Hyperloop-DP World Consortium as the Original Project Proponent (OPP) for the Mumbai-Pune hyperloop project. Virgin Hyperloop also signed an MoU with the transport department in Punjab. A fortnight ago, it announced a partnership with Bengaluru International Airports Ltd to conduct a feasibility study for a proposed hyperloop corridor from the Kempegowda International Airport.

Virgin Hyperloop now aims to achieve safety certification by 2025, with commercial operations beginning in 2030.

Richard Branson, Founder of the Virgin Group. said, “We’re one step closer to making hyperloop travel a reality for people everywhere.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/virgin-hyperloop-sets-up-global-hyperloop-certification-centre/article32822752.ece

Continuing the series of its maritime engagements, the Navy is scheduled to hold another Passage Exercise (PASSEX) with a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier group on October 12, an official source said.

Navy ships will hold a PASSEX with USS Ronald Reagan on October 12 as it transits through the Indian Ocean, the official said. The PASSEX is likely to be held in the waters off Kochi.

On September 25, for the first time a U.S. Navy P-8A long range maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) landed at Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, for refuelling under the bilateral logistics support agreement.

In July, frontline warships of the Navy conducted a PASSEX with the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz carrier strike group near the Andaman and Nicobar islands as it was transiting the Indian Ocean. The USS Nimitz was returning from the South China Sea through the Strait of Malacca where it undertook Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOP). USS Ronald Reagan was in the South China Sea in August to conduct FONOPs amid tensions between China and the U.S.

48,2020/10/10,Concerns raised over imports of mountain clothing for Army,"Vice-Chief of Army Lt. Gen. S.K. Saini calls for domestic production.

With the Army looking to strengthen troops in high altitude areas in Eastern Ladakh due to the ongoing standoff with China, the Vice-Chief of Army Lt. Gen. S.K. Saini on Saturday called for attaining self-reliance and reducing import of special clothing and mountaineering equipment.

“A large number of our troops are deployed in super high-altitude areas where the temperature touches (minus) 50°C. However, we are still importing cold weather equipment, mainly due to the lack of viable indigenous solutions,” Lt. Gen. Saini said. A collaborative effort is needed to fulfil the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat, he said at a webinar organised by the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies.

The Army has been maintaining troops in high altitude areas of Siachen glacier at heights of 20,000 feet for decades. With the ongoing standoff along the disputed border with China, the Army has procured clothing and shelter to house the troops through the winter in Ladakh as there has been no progress in talks for disengagement.

Security of establishments

Lt. Gen. Saini also highlighted the security of defence establishments and vital installations, improvised explosive devices (IED) and drones as major priority areas to find domestic solutions. “Though the industry has stepped up to the challenge, the solutions provided lack innovation and integration,” he said, calling for efforts to ensure reduction in manpower commitment by integrating physical and electronic surveillance and incorporating automation.

Lt. Gen. Saini said IEDs seem to be gaining traction as a favoured tool for terrorists and anti-national elements. “It ends up causing both physical and psychological trauma and seriously impairs readiness, by forcing us to commit scarce resources for our protection,” he said, stressing that technological innovation is the key to combating the threat.

The Central Bureau of Investigation is in the process of taking over the probe into the alleged gang rape and assault on a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras on September 14, following a reference from the Uttar Pradesh government. The victim succumbed to her injuries at a hospital in Delhi on September 29.

The case is likely to be handed over to the Ghaziabad unit of the agency. A team comprising forensic experts will soon be sent to the spot where the incident took place.

Hathras gang rape | Victim’s family to appear before Allahabad High Court on October 12

The woman was initially admitted to a hospital in Aligarh after she was allegedly assaulted by four upper caste persons in her village. She was then shifted to Safdarjung Hospital in South Delhi.

The local police registered a criminal case against one Sandip on a complaint from the victim’s brother. The accused was arrested on charges of attempt-to-murder and under relevant provisions of the SC/ST Act. Based on the woman’s statement on September 22, three more persons were booked and an additional provision of gang rape was invoked. The three, identified as Ramu, Lavkush and Ravi, were also arrested.

The victim’s death triggered a public outrage, leading the Opposition political parties to take up the matter. It was alleged that the local administration consigned the body to the flames in the early hours of September 30 without the consent of her family members. However, the district officials claimed that the last rites were performed with their consent and that some close members of the family were present at the funeral.

50,2020/10/10,Posters wishing Taiwan taken down after Chinese embassy complaint,"They were put up by a BJP leader and were not authorised, says New Delhi Municipal Council.

Posters wishing Taiwan on its “National Day event” by a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were taken down after the Chinese embassy in Delhi raised the issue with the Ministry of External Affairs, sources in New Delhi said. The New Delhi Municipal Council said the posters were not authorised and were removed.

The posters, issued by BJP’s former Delhi spokesperson Tajinder Singh Bagga, had been put on billboards outside the Chinese embassy on Shantipath in the diplomatic area, and wished Taiwan “Happy National Day” for October 10 on Friday evening.

They were put up “without permission” and were ‘unauthorised’, the NDMC spokesperson told The Hindu, adding that they were taken down on Saturday morning by their staff, who were alerted after Mr. Bagga had tweeted about it.

In a tweet the Chinese embassy said, “China firmly opposes any individual or any move trying to create ‘two Chinas’ or ‘One-China, one Taiwan’, which violates this position.”

India does not recognise the “Republic of China [Taiwan]” diplomatically, though New Delhi maintains cultural, economic and tourism ties with Taipei. The controversy over the celebrations of Taiwan’s “national day” grew after the Chinese embassy sent a note to journalists asking them to “stick to Indian government’s position on Taiwan question and not violate the One-China principle”.

The MEA declined to comment on the posters but had dismissed the embassy letter on Thursday saying the Indian media is free and “reports on issues as it sees fit”.

51,2020/10/10,"Twenty three States, eight UTs have abolished interview for government jobs: Jitendra Singh","The abolition of interview and considering only the written test marks as merit for selection offers an equal level-playing field to all the candidates, the Union Minister said.

Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Saturday that interview for recruitment in government jobs has been abolished in 23 States and eight Union Territories so far, according to a Personnel Ministry statement.

This, he said, is a follow-up to the abolition of interview for Group-B (non-gazetted) and Group-C posts in the Central government ever since 2016.

It was in 2015, while speaking from the ramparts of Red Fort in New Delhi on the occasion of Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had suggested abolition of interview and making the job selection totally on the basis of written test because whenever an interview call was received by a candidate, his entire family would get disturbed with apprehension and anxiety, the Minister recalled.

On a quick follow-up to the Prime Minister’s advice, he said, the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) undertook an expeditious exercise and within three months completed the entire process to announce abolition of interview for recruitment in Central government with effect from January 1, 2016.

While some States such as Maharashtra and Gujarat were quick to implement this rule, there were other States which were quite reluctant to abolish the conduct of interview for jobs, said Mr. Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel.

He expressed satisfaction that after quite a bit of persuasion and repeated reminders to certain State governments, today the practice of conducting interview stands discontinued in all the eight Union Territories of India including Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh, and 23 out of 28 States of the country, the statement said.

Mr. Singh said, in the past there had been complaints, grievances and allegations about marks in interview being manipulated to help certain favoured candidates.

The abolition of interview and considering only the written test marks as merit for selection, he said, offers an equal level-playing field to all the candidates.

In addition to bringing in transparency and objectivity in the recruitment process, Mr. Singh said, several States have also reported heavy savings on the State exchequer because quite a substantial expenditure was being incurred in conducting interview of candidates whose number often ran in thousands and the interview process continued for several days together.

Pertinent to mention that earlier there had often been complaints of the written test merit being compromised by lowering the interview marks of the candidate in order to help certain candidates for dubious considerations, the statement said.

There were also allegations of job for money or heavy amount being paid to secure jobs by manipulating the interview marks, it said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/30vvcs/article30888726.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10JITENDRASINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/twenty-three-states-eight-uts-have-abolished-interview-for-government-jobs-jitendra-singh/article32821599.ece

“The proposal is to amend the CMVR 1989 to facilitate such citizens. The citizens can apply through the Indian Embassy / Mission Abroad portals and the applications would then move to the VAHAN for being considered by the respective RTOs (regional transport offices),” the statement said.

The proposal also includes removal of the conditions of a medical certificate and a valid visa at the time of making the request for the IDP in the country.

“Further, there are certain countries where the visa is on arrival and in such cases the visa was not available when applying for the IDP in India before travel,” the statement said.

Bharat Biotech, which had sought DCGI’s nod for conducting phase-3 clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, has been asked to submit complete safety and immunogenicity data of the ongoing phase-2 trial, besides providing some clarifications, before proceeding for the next stage.

The vaccine candidate— ‘Covaxin’ — is being indigenously developed by the Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

According to officials, the Hyderabad-based vaccine maker applied to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) on October 2, seeking its permission to conduct phase-3 randomised double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

The firm in its application said that the study would cover 28,500 subjects aged 18 years and above and would be conducted in 19 sites — including Delhi, Mumbai, Patna and Lucknow — across 10 States.

According to sources, the phase-2 trial of Covaxin is going on and the second dose is yet to be given to volunteers at some sites.

“The company presented phase-3 clinical trial protocol along with interim data of phase 1 and 2 clinical trials,” an official said.

The subject expert committee (SEC) at the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation(CDSCO) deliberated on the application on October 5.

“After a detailed deliberation, the committee opined that the design of the phase-3 study is in principle satisfactory except for clarification on definition of asymptomatic, etc.

“However, the study should be initiated with appropriate dose identified from the phase-2 safety and immunogenicity data. Accordingly, the firm should submit safety and immunogenicity data from phase-2 trial for consideration,” the panel said in its recommendations.

The SEC during its discussion also observed that the vaccine was well-tolerated in all dose groups and no serious adverse events have been reported so far, a source said.

The most common adverse event was pain at the injection site, which resolved transiently, the source said.

The phase-3 clinical trial application proposed a dose of 0.5 ml on day 0 and 28, sources said.

56,2020/10/10,Rahul Gandhi targets Modi again on VIP aircraft with tweet on non-bullet-proof trucks for jawans,"Former Congress president posts video clip of jawans complaining how their lives are being put at risk

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi again on the purchase of a VIP aircraft by tweeting a two-minute video clip.

In the video clip, jawans in a truck were complaining how their lives were being put at risk by ferrying them in a non-bullet-proof vehicle.

“Our jawans are being sent in non-bullet-proof trucks to become martyrs, while a ₹8,400 crore plane for the Prime Minister. Is this justice,” asked Mr. Gandhi on Twitter, tagging the two-minute video clip.

Neither the date of the video nor its location is known but jawans were complaining that “they were being sent in a non-bullet-proof vehicle when even a bullet-proof vehicle in their area was also not sufficient to protect them”.

Mr. Gandhi has targeted Mr. Modi for the second time in two days over the purchase of the VIP aircraft.

On Thursday, the Congress leader tweeted to show the number of essential items the government could have purchased for soldiers posted in Siachen-Ladakh with the amount spent on the aircraft.

His tweet was in response to a news report in a Hindi newspaper that claimed the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament had sought permission from the Lok Sabha Speaker to visit Ladakh for an assessment on the ground after a Comptroller and Auditor General report flagged delays in the procurement of essential items for soldiers.

“The Prime Minister spent ₹ 8,400 crore to acquire an air plane. For our soldiers posted in Siachen-Ladakh, this amount could have bought: Warm Clothing: 30,00,000, Jackets and gloves: 60,00,000, Shoes: 67,20,000, Oxygen Cylinders: 16,80,000.

58,2020/10/10,"Ensure police follow SOP in crimes against women, MHA to States","Advisory underlines need to record victim’s statement, safe collection of samples.

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has issued an advisory to all States regarding “mandatory action by police in crime against women”.

The Ministry reiterated that the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, provides that the statement, written or verbal, by a person who is dead shall be treated as relevant fact in the investigation.

Recently, the role of Uttar Pradesh police had come under scanner after the Hathras gang rape incident when a 19-year-old woman had given a statement from hospital bed that she was sexually assaulted by four men from her village. Police claimed that the forensic examination had established that the victim was not raped. She later succumbed to injuries at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital.

SC ruling

“Section 32 (1) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, provides that the statement, written or verbal, by a person who is dead shall be treated as relevant fact in the investigation when the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death. Hon'ble Supreme Court in its order dated 7th January 2020, in the matter of Criminal Appeal Nos. 194-195 of 2012 in the case of Purshottam Chopra & Anr. v. State (Govt. of NCT Delhi), directed that a particular statement, when being offered as dying declaration and satisfies all the requirements of judicial scrutiny, cannot be discarded merely because it has not been recorded by a Magistrate or that the police officer did not obtain attestation by any person present at the time of making of the statement,” MHA’s advisory said.

The MHA also said Section 173 of Code of Criminal Procedure provides for completion of investigation in rape cases within two months.

“In order to facilitate the State police to monitor compliance, in this regard MHA has provided an online portal called Investigation Tracking System for Sexual Offences (ITSSO) for monitoring the same. This is available exclusively to law enforcement officers,” the Ministry said.

It reminded the States regarding compulsory registration of FIR in cases of cognizable offences.

“The law also enables the police to register FIR or a ‘Zero FIR’ (in case the crime is committed outside the jurisdiction of police station) in the event of receipt of information on commission of a cognizable offence, which includes cases of sexual assault on women,” the Ministry said.

Officials accountable

It added that Section 166 A(c) of the Indian Penal Code 1860 (IPC) provides for punishment to a public servant for failure to record FIR in relation to cognizable offences including cases of sexual assault.

The MHA said section 164-A of CrPC provides that in rape/sexual assault investigation, the victim shall be examined by a registered medical practitioner under consent within 24 hours from the time of receiving the information relating to the commission of such offence.

MHA also asked States to adhere to the guidelines issued by Directorate of Forensic Science Services (DFSS) for collection, preservation and transportation of forensic evidence in sexual assault cases. “In order to facilitate the State Police, Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) has issued Sexual Assault Evidence Collection (SAEC) Kits to every State/UT. It is necessary to use these SAEC kits in every case of sexual assault reported,” it said.

MHA asked States to investigate lapses in matters of women safety.

“However, even with stringent provisions in law and several capacity building measures undertaken, any failure of police to adhere to these mandatory requirements may not augur well for the delivery of criminal justice in the country, especially in context of women safety. Such lapses, if noticed, need to be investigated into and stringent action taken immediately against the concerned officers responsible for the same,” MHA said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/xhgexk/article32806860.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-1077499306,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-issues-fresh-advisory-to-states-on-women-safety/article32819423.ece
59,2020/10/10,"Relief on loans up to ₹2 crore addresses borrowers’ distress, RBI tells Supreme Court","Complete waiver of compound interest will destabilise broader financial stability, says central bank

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has told the Supreme Court that the Centre’s resolve to shoulder the cost of ‘interest on interest’ for MSME loans and personal loans up to ₹2 crore addresses pandemic-induced financial distress among borrowers.

The RBI termed it additional relief.

Also read: RBI loan restructuring plan | A difficult choice for borrowers

The central bank reasoned that a complete waiver, on the other hand, of compound interest (interest on interest) chargeable during the six-month moratorium would destabilise “broader financial stability” and irreparably dent the banks.

“A long moratorium exceeding six months can also impact credit behaviour of borrowers and increase the risks of delinquencies post resumption of scheduled payments. It may result in vitiating the overall credit discipline, which will have a debilitating impact on the process of credit creation in the economy. It will be the small borrowers who may end up bearing the brunt of the impact, as their access to formal lending channels is critically dependent on the credit culture,” the RBI told the Supreme Court in an affidavit filed late on October 9.

The affidavit contains a consolidated reply to demands for financial reprieve and waiver of compound interest made in a host of petitions filed across sectors from power to real estate and individual borrowers whose purses have been affected by the virus onslaught.

‘Temporary relief’

The RBI said the moratorium was only a temporary relief implemented without discrimination. The decision on how to implement and which customer should get the benefit of moratorium was left to individual financial institutions and banks.

“The lending institutions have been permitted to extend the moratorium to any borrower/class of borrower in a transparent manner based on their board-approved policies. Similarly, even the borrowers have the discretion on whether to avail of the moratorium or not, after weighing various costs involved,” the affidavit explained.

The RBI explained that its Resolution Framework, based on the suggestions of the K.V. Kamath Expert Committee, issued on August 6, was aimed at facilitating revival of real sector activities and mitigating the impact on the ultimate borrowers. The framework gives complete discretion to lending institutions and borrowers to arrive at resolution plans tailored to the specific requirements of various sector, of course, subject to the “prudential boundaries”.

The resolution plans to take into account the pre-Covid-19 operating and financial performance of the borrower and impact of the virus on the latter.

The affidavit presents a bleak picture on power and real estate sectors, which were “already stressed even before the outbreak of the pandemic”. The “travails” of the real estate sector cannot be solved through banking regulations alone, the RBI noted.

“The banking regulations of RBI cannot substitute the addressal of structural problems of the real [estate] sector... Real estate sector has undergone structural changes in the recent past and is also facing a demand problem as evident from the high levels of unsold inventories and stalled projects,” the central bank pointed out.

However, the RBI said an “already existing framework” could be used to restructure projects under implementation and affected by the pandemic. “This extant framework allows for extension of timeline for completion of the projects by two years in case of non-infra projects, including real estate projects, and by four years for infrastructure projects without downgrading to non-performing assets”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hmd9xx/article32819272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDMSME,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/relief-on-loans-up-to-2-crore-addresses-borrowers-distress-rbi-tells-supreme-court/article32819273.ece
60,2020/10/10,HAL staff held for supplying aircraft details to Pakistan’s ISI,"Deepak Shirsat was working as an assistant supervisor at HAL and was “honey trapped” by a Pakistani national posing as a woman on social media

An employee of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has been arrested for allegedly supplying Indian fighter aircraft details to Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, the Maharashtra police said on Friday.

Deepak Shirsat (41) was working as an assistant supervisor at HAL and was “honey trapped” by a Pakistani national posing as a woman on social media, police said.

The Nashik unit of the state Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) had received reliable intelligence about the man, who was in constant touch with ISI, according to a police statement.

The man was supplying secret information about Indian fighter aircraft and their sensitive details, along with information related to HAL’s aircraft manufacturing unit at Ojhar near Nashik airbase and prohibited area inside the manufacturing unit, the statement said.

An offence under the Official Secrets Act has been registered against Mr. Shirsat, an official said, adding Nashik ATS unit arrested him from his house in Nashik.

Three mobile handsets along with five SIM cards and two memory cards have been seized from him, he said. The phones and SIM cards were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for examination, he added.

The accused was produced before court on Friday, and has been remanded in ATS custody for 10 days, he said.

Investigation so far has revealed that Mr. Shirsat was honey trapped by a Pakistani national, probably an ISI handler, who chatted with him posing as a woman, ATS DCP Vinay Rathod told PTI.

The Pakistani national told Shirsat that he likes aircraft, after which the HAL employee started sharing sensitive information about India’s fighter aircraft with him on WhatsApp and other social media platforms, Rathod said.

NEW DELHI After a conciliation meeting on October 9, three staff federations of the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) have called off their indefinite strike planned from October 12 against the government’s move to corporatise the OFB, the Defence Ministry has said.

“It was agreed by the representatives of the federations and officials of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) that, during the pendency of ongoing conciliation proceedings, the Ministry will abide by the provisions of Section 33(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947, which stipulates that the employer cannot alter the conditions of service of the employees till the conclusion of conciliation proceedings,” the Ministry said in a statement. However, it will not affect the government’s decision to corporatise OFB, it added.

In July 2020, the government took a decision to convert OFB, a subordinate office of MoD, into one or more than one 100% government-owned corporate entities, registered under the Companies Act, 2013.

Following this, three federations of defence civil employees gave notice for a joint strike from October 12. The MoD referred the matter to the Chief Labour Commissioner, Ministry of Labour and Employment to initiate conciliation.

The representatives of the federations have also been invited to meet the Secretary, Department of Defence Production and the Empowered Group of Ministers to put forward their issues and grievances, the statement added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mapcvd/article32819050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDDEFENCEMINISTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ofb-federations-call-off-proposed-strike/article32819051.ece

Civil rights activists and organisations on Friday condemned the arrest of Stan Swamy, 83-year-old tribal rights activist, by the National Investigation Agency in the Bhima Koregaon case.

Mr. Swamy, arrested on Thursday from his Ranchi house, was sent to judicial custody till October 23.

Terming the arrest a gross violation of human rights and democratic norms, the activists said, “Mr. Swamy has worked for Adivasi rights since decades in Jharkhand.”

“The inhuman act of the NIA authorities in arresting Mr. Swamy stands out for its sheer vindictiveness. He fully cooperated with the investigating officers when they questioned him for over 15 hours [on 27, 30 July and 6 August],” they said in a statement.

The activists pointed out that Mr. Swamy had consistently denied any link with extremist leftist forces or Maoists.

“He had also clearly told the NIA that some so-called extracts allegedly taken from his computer shown to him by the NIA were fake and fabricated and that he disowned them,” says the statement.

“Among other issues, he works on displacement, corporate loot of resources, the condition of undertrials and the Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act. Mr. Swamy has been a vocal critic of the BJP government’s attempts to amend land laws and the land acquisition Act in Jharkhand, and a strong advocate of the Forest Rights Act, PESA and related laws,” it says.

“We firmly believe that the Bhima-Koregaon case is baseless,” the activists said in the statement.

They appealed to Chief Minister Hemant Soren, who had earlier opposed Mr. Swamy’s arrest, to resist the arrest this time too.

64,2020/10/10,"Priyanka Gandhi hails Kanshi Ram, her barbs against Mayawati notwithstanding","She calls the BSP founder a strong pillar who emboldened the voice of the deprived

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday, while paying tribute to the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) founder Kanshi Ram on his death anniversary, described him as a “strong pillar” who strengthened the politics of social justice in India.

“My salute to Honourable Kanshi Ram ji who emboldened the voice of the Dalit and the deprived and was a strong pillar of strengthening the politics of social justice and Constitutional values,” Ms. Vadra tweeted.

The Congress leader’s remarks on the BSP founder is in sharp contrast to her recent twitter barbs at BSP supremo Mayawati, whom she had described as an “informal spokesperson for the BJP.”

Her latest tweet also reflects the Congress party’s attempt to reach out to the Dalit community, once its traditional vote bank along with Muslims in Uttar Pradesh (U.P.), and create a political space for the party.

When U.P. politics swung between Mandal-Kamandal (Reservation and Hindutva) in the early 1990s, the Congress didn't just lose out its support base, but was also left without political narrative.

After being given the task of reviving the party in a State where the Congress doesn't have a robust organisation, Ms. Vadra is trying to occupy the political centrestage by confronting the Yogi Adityanath government over issues like law and order, women’s security and employment among others.

During the recent protests over the Hathras gangrape, while the top leaders of main Opposition parties like Samajwadi Party (SP) and the BSP refrained from visiting the victim's family, Ms Vadra along with her brother and former party chief, Rahul Gandhi, faced off with the U.P. police to reach Hathras.

“@myogiadityanath RESIGN. Instead of protecting the victim and her family, your government became complicit in depriving her of every single human right, even in death. You have no moral right to continue as Chief Minister,” Ms. Vadra had tweeted after the U.P. government had allegedly cremated the victim at night without the family members in attendance.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7og15g/article32818062.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KANSHI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/priyanka-gandhi-hails-kanshi-ram-her-barbs-against-mayawati-notwithstanding/article32818063.ece

The “managers” Siva Shankar and Nagaraj, who were supposed to conduct interviews for the rest of the jobseekers, realised that they were cheated when they found that the rented office room was vacated by Dattatreya. They approached the Ajith Singh Nagar police on October 6 and lodged a complaint, he said.

The police who were investigating the case found the accused Dattatreya had posted similar advertisements on OLX for recruitment in Rajahmundry and Guntur. He was traced and caught using his mobile phone signals.

The police recovered ₹60,000 from the accused. It was also found that Dattatreya allegedly duped people in Ajith Singh Nagar police station limits in the name of lottery earlier.

Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University will hold an annual seed mela before the onset of kharif season, said Vice-Chancellor Adala Vishnuvardhan Reddy.

“The seed mela will be held on the ANGRAU premises at Lam in Guntur district probably in the third week of May, well before the start of the agricultural season. We will provide the best varieties of seed produced as a result of years of research, and will hand-hold the farmers throughout the year,” Dr. Reddy said.

With the availability of quality seed remaining one of the core concerns to the farming community, the university will start seed germination centres in farms. Farmers would form seed cooperative societies and produce seeds under the supervision of Rythu Bharosa Kendras. The university will transfer the technology to the farmers through the RBKs using smart televisions and other communication technologies.

“We are also mulling to start business incubation centres in which the farmers can also directly sell the seed produced under the supervision of the university. We will guide the farmers in adapting to different climates, weather patterns and market interventions and we will start by producing seed in about 3,000 to 5,000 acres,’’ said Dr. Reddy.

Rice production

Stating that Andhra Pradesh was the largest rice producing State in the country, with over a third of rice produced in the State, Dr. Reddy said that the popular BPT-5204, produced at Bapatla Agricultural College, was known for its taste the world over. Andhra Pradesh was truly the rice bowl of the country with over one-third acreage of 42 million hectares in the country.

Soon after taking charge, Dr. Reddy began to focus on teaching and research facilities in the university. The university has 47 research stations across the State.

70,2020/10/10,A failed experiment in East Godavari,"1 lakh bags of paddy remained unsold with farmers as millers bought it from other States, says activist

The main objectives of two farm legislations, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce Act and Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act – allowing farmers to sell their harvest outside the notified Agricultural Market Committee (AMC) Yard and facilitation of contract farming and direct marketing – have already been put into practice in East Godavari district. The reforms have been experimented with four major crops – paddy, banana, coconut and sugarcane – but many farmers have complained that they have ruined the marketing system.

Says CPI(M) leader Moorthi Raja Sekhar: ""In the case of paddy, millers were permitted to procure it from outside by 2017. Between 2017 and 2019 at least one lakh bags of paddy (each 80 kg) grown by local farmers remained unsold. The millers met their levy target by buying from Odisha, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh at lower prices than the minimum support price. The facility disrupted the entire procurement system.""

Mr. Raja Sekhar, an activist working on tenancy in agriculture and allied sectors, contends that the contract farming method adopted in sugarcane farming has marred the prospects of the commercial crop in the district. ""The farmers cultivating sugarcane under a contract with three factories at Tuni, Samalkota and Karapa have never received a remunerative price. The factory provides input cost on the condition that the farmer should supply the harvest to it,"" he alleges.

‘A trap’

According to AP Rythu Kuli Sangham (APRS) East Godavari unit president Tirumalasetti Nageswara Rao, ""The two Acts are nothing but a trap. The farmer will be lured with short-term benefits and later will be left with no option except signing the contract with corporates after the entire marketing chain is ruined.""

The Ravulapalem banana yard is flourishing with an annual turnover of ₹360 crore, where 2,000 farmers sell their produce every day. ""If it collapses under the new system, the farmers will have nowhere to go except playing into the hands of corporates,"" Mr. Nageswara Rao says.

In the case of coconut, the Farmers Producers’ Organisation (FPO) encouraged in the Konaseema area did not succeed. The contract system will also push the future of tenant farmers into uncertainty, many opine.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/a-failed-experiment-in-east-godavari/article32823612.ece

Education Minister A. Suresh on Saturday refuted the allegation that Jagananna Vidya Kanuka was a Central scheme hijacked by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government.

Addressing the media here, the Minister asserted that the novel scheme was the brainchild of the Chief Minister, who was passionate about extending quality education to children belonging to all sections of society. To ensure that poverty did not hinder a child’s education, he came up with this programme that took care of all the needs of schoolchildren, he added.

‘Children excited’

The novelty of the scheme had attracted the attention of other States, the Minister claimed, adding that children were excited about not just their new school kits but also about the new look of their school buildings and classrooms, and were eager to attend their classes.

The Minister said children and their parents were upbeat, and were thankful to Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. But unable to digest his “growing popularity,” the Opposition leaders made baseless allegations about the programme, he said.

Central funds

Speaking about the Central funds, Mr. Suresh said the State had received only ₹100 crore from the Centre. The YSRCP government had spent ₹293 crore on purchase of three pairs of uniform cloth for each student while the stitching charges were being deposited in the bank accounts of the students’ mothers. A total of ₹650 crore was spent on distribution of school kits to 43 lakh students, he said.

Giving the break-up, the Minister said that ₹69.44 crore was spent on school bags, ₹79.05 crore on notebooks, ₹67.75 crore on a pair of shoes and two pairs of socks for each student, ₹10.13 crore on belts and ₹29.70 crore on workbooks.

He said that if there was any student who did not receive the kits, he or she should approach the authorities who would immediately respond. He said the aim was to reduce school dropout rate and bring children out of school into the school fold.

The Minister said he was ready for a discussion on the subject with any of Opposition leader who was not convinced.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/foll3q/article32825833.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJPG4-SURESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vidya-kanuka-is-jagans-brainchild-says-education-minister/article32823604.ece

which promised a return of ₹1 lakh per acre. But its representatives did not return to buy the produce.

The plants were grown in over 1,200 acres by the farmers in and around Addanki by spending ₹40,000 per acre.

""No relief is in sight even after moving the local court,"" laments another grower K. Subba Rao as the Farm Act ruled out moving a court of law in case of any dispute over the contents of the agreement under contract farming.

Hopes dashed

In another instance, going by the big returns promised by paper mills, growers took up cultivation of eucalyptus, subabul and casuarina in large tracts of land. ""Six years after planting the saplings I am clueless on selling the logs now as the price dropped to about ₹2,000 per tonne as against ₹4,200 per tonne fixed by the State government,"" laments a farmer from Chimakurthy, K. Venkaiah.

""It is advantage paper mills as the AMCs are now bypassed by the mills which have created a network of brokers to buy logs,"" says All India Kisan Sangarsh Coordination Committee Prakasam district convenor Ch. Ranga Rao, himself a grower in Venkatadripalem village near Maddipadu.

An average farmer does not go beyond the mandal headquarters for marketing. ""The so-called freeing of market which the farm Acts facilitate will only work to the advantage of big corporates as remunerative price for farm produce remains elusive for most crops in the absence of market intervention by government agencies,"" opines AP Rythu Sangam Prakasam district secretary Vadde Hanuma Reddy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/64nfy0/article32823570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/227880343col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/peasants-dread-contract-farming/article32823571.ece
73,2020/10/10,‘Farmers will reap reform benefits’,"The laws are long overdue, says ryots’ consortium adviser

The three farm Acts will bring in revolutionary reforms in the lives of farmers in the country, according to veteran farmers’ leader Peddireddy Changal Reddy, chief advisor of the Consortium of Indian Farmers’ Associations (CIFA).

Though the present Acts brought in by the Central government should have been actually passed in the 1990s, they got stuck for political reasons, he opines.

""The dreams of Sharad Joshi and M.S. Swaminathan for farmers’ welfare are set to become a reality now. Most of the farmers are still in confusion about the advantages of the reforms, as they are victimised by false political propaganda from some quarters,"" Mr. Changal Reddy tells The Hindu.

The Central government should immediately launch campaigns to educate farmers about the efficacy of the laws.

All-round improvement

The Acts intended to galvanise agricultural reforms will go a long way in improving productivity and quality, curtailing wastage and strengthening global competitiveness of Indian farm sector. ""The CIFA has been demanding reforms in farm sector for the last two decades. The previous UPA government had not honoured the M.S. Swaminathan report. The farmers’ associations are happy with the steps to rejuvenate national economy based on agriculture,"" Mr. Changal Reddy says.

Lakhs of horticulture and dairy farmers will reap benefits if the reforms are implemented in true spirit. ""Though India is producing over 2 crore tonnes of about 1,000 varieties of mangoes, we are not able export even 1%. The aspects of uniformity in cultivation, harvesting and technology application will go a long way in strengthening exports,"" he explains.

‘Criticism politically motivated’

He rejects the criticism that the Acts would only foster the corporate sectors as ‘politically engineered’. ""The public are always bound to be associated with the ‘so-called corporate sector’ for all their needs from toothbrush to cars and even agriculture machinery. Attacking the reforms by deliberately playing the card of corporatisation is not fair,"" reasons Mr. Reddy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/farmers-will-reap-reform-benefits/article32823550.ece

75,2020/10/10,Pushed out of safety net?,"‘Market yards allowed govts. to intervene when prices crashed and aid farmers’

The buzz is missing at Asia’s largest chilli yard in Guntur. The enactment of Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce Act, which allows farmers to sell agricultural produce outside the Agricultural Market Committee (AMC), has yet to sink in the local farmers, most of who own less than 0.6 hectare, but has caused considerable consternation among farmers’ unions and progressive leaders, who feel that the legislation has removed the safety net for farmers and allowed the corporate giants with deep pockets to control the markets.

""The Act removes the safety net around farmers. In spite of many ills plaguing the AMCs, including the role of commission agents, the mandis offer farmers a protective atmosphere. The governments can effectively intervene whenever the market crashes and support the farmers. AMCs had existed in the pre-independence period and there were then elected bodies. The AMCs or mandis in North India have been effective in controlling the corporates,"" says Kolla Rajamohan, Nallamada Rythu Sangham president.

Bihar experience

Citing the example of Bihar where AMCs were scrapped 20 years ago, he says it led to an agrarian distress as farmers were forced to sell much below the MSP. It caused unprecedented unemployment forcing most of the people to migrate to other State.

Now, the chilli farmers in Guntur will face a piquant situation as only corporate companies will come to their doorstep to buy the produce, he says.

Even the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act is not good for farmers, Mr. Rajamohan opines.

Contract farming in India is in the hands of a few big companies. ""In Guntur, the ITC introduced subabul crop but when farmers demanded a better price, the company backed off despite pressure from the then State government,’’ recalls Mr. Rajamohan.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vr4wd7/article32823532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/227889724col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pushed-out-of-safety-net/article32823533.ece

79,2020/10/10,"New farm Acts: farmers confused about its impact, worried about future","Primarily, many farmers feel that the amendment to the Essential Commodities Act might affect their farming prospects and their choice of crop.

The NDA government has pushed three farm Bills in both Houses of Parliament, but it has left the farmers in the State in a state of confusion. They are worried about their implementation, the freedom to produce and sell products of their choice, the role of corporate companies in the farming sector and most importantly, they feel that the laws lack clarity.

""It may be good, but since there is a lack of clarity in many aspects, we are confused a lot,"" says Thota Appalanarasaiah, a small farmer in Chodavaram mandal of Visakhapatnam district.

Primarily, many farmers feel that the amendment to the Essential Commodities Act might affect their farming prospects and their choice of crop.

""The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act will hurt farmers, especially small farmers, and the safeguards provided by the original Act, will be removed,"" CPI(M) State Secretariat Member Ch. Narasinga Rao tells The Hindu.

The Act was brought in by Parliament after learning a lesson from the Bengal famine of 1943. It ensured some safeguards and helped governments to get rid of hoarding and black marketing of certain commodities, he says.

Mandis out

The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act abolishes the old concept of market yards or mandis.

In India, over 86% are small and medium farmers whose land holdings vary from one to five acres.

N. Apparao, a sugarcane farmer from Anakapalle area of Visakhapatnam district, who produces jaggery, says, ""Now there is a market yard and we negotiate on our terms and sell the product. But if it is shut then where do we go?""

""Jaggery is a small product compared to other produce such as wheat or paddy. But still, there is a yard and it benefits small farmers. The price is set in the yard in a democratic way and it is regulated, as per the demand and supply,"" remarks Konathala Lakshminarayana, president of the Anakapalle Merchants’ Association.

According to K. Narayana, CPI national secretary, in market yards there is a protection price fixed by the government and yard management. ""If there is any mismanagement in pricing, there is scope for a dialogue and it may even lead to an agitation. If market yards are closed, everything goes into the hands of corporate companies. For a small farmer from Uttarandhra or Kurnool, it is not possible to go to Delhi to sell his products,"" he explains.

One-sided deals?

Also Read Pushed out of safety net?

Many farmers also feel that their choice of produce and pricing may be dictated by the third legislation, the Farmers (Empowerment and protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.

""As per this Act, we get to understand that we have to get into a prior agreement on prices and services. Till now we have been negotiating with the government and it is fairly democratic, but with corporate companies, will it be possible, considering our level of understanding?"" wonders Ch. Nageswara Rao, a small farmer from Narsipatnam.

""Corporate companies will dictate what is to be grown and at what price it is to be sold. The companies will look for produce that has more export value rather than what is required. Instead of a green revolution, it may lead to food scarcity. This happened in Latin American countries when corporates got staple crops replaced to produce food required for animals in the U.S.,"" says Mr. Narasinga Rao.

""Farmers will lose independence and small, independent farmers will become tenant farmers as it happened in Bengal during the colonial rule,"" feels Mr. Narayana.

82,2020/10/10,Sand scarcity hits construction activity,"Policies of State government deprive many of livelihood, say CITU leaders

Construction industry has been hit hard both in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts due to sand scarcity. Hundreds of constructions in the two districts have come to a halt.

According to sources, sand, at present, is available only in black market and a load of lorry costs around ₹30,000. In normal days, it costs ₹12, 000 to ₹14,000 depending on the distance of the stock point and place of construction. With sand becoming dearer, several individuals have stopped the construction activity.

“Earlier, sand transport was allowed from ramps in bullock carts. The small quantity used to help individuals who were constructing their houses and shops. Now, the administration has banned it,” says a trader of Srikakulam. “Also, there is no supply of sand through online booking. We have been waiting for two months for sand. The government should look into the issue since it would have an impact on labourers also,” he adds.

K.C.S. Bose, general secretary of Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India, AP chapter, has urged the government to ensure supply of sand as the construction sector is in crisis. “Thousands of labourers, electricians, welders, painters and others lost their livelihood due to delay in supply of sand. The government also loses revenue since construction industry pays direct and indirect taxes. The revenue of the Registration and Stamps Department has also come down significantly,” he points out.

In fact, the government decided to give top priority to local supply. However, it is not being implemented in spite of many ramps located at many rivers including Nagavali, Vamsadhara, and Mahendratanaya.

Restrictions

According to sources, too many restrictions and supply through stockyards instead of ramps and other factors led to delay in supply of sand.

CITU Vizianagaram district president G. Appala Suri and general secretary T.V. Ramana have alleged that more than 25,000 labourers and others lost livelihood as a result of what they called ‘wrong’ policies of the government.

Meanwhile, officials attribute delay in supply of sand to its non-availability in sufficient quantities in ramps.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/br3rld/article32823411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11ONGSAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sand-scarcity-hits-construction-activity/article32823412.ece

For the first time, tomatoes of Madanapalle region, the largest tomato-growing belt in Asia, are set to reach Chennai by rail. The modalities pertaining to the loading, unloading and time schedules would be finalised in a couple of days in coordination with agriculture and horticulture wings, traders and railway authorities.

District Collector Narayana Bharat Gupta on Saturday announced that the first batch of the tomato stock would be transported to Chennai next week.

The decision was the outcome of a series of meetings between the district administration and traders’ associations of tomato and mango products of Chittoor district and Tamil Nadu and railway authorities as well.

As of now, the tomato and mango stocks, including the pulp, reach Chennai and other parts of the country from Chittoor district by road through containers. The tomatoes meant for export would be predominantly procured from Kalikiri, Gurramkonda and Madanapalle mandals, the main contributors to the Agriculture market at Madanapalle. Besides, huge stocks also reach Chennai from the Vaddepalle market in V. Kota mandal.

Mr. Gupta said that regular rail transportation of tomatoes from Madanapalle to Chennai and other parts would result in further boom in the horticulture trade of Chittoor district. The traders felt that rail transportation would be beneficial to them and the risk of damage to the produce would be less compared to sending it by road. It is expected that the initial shipment would require about six bogies and the number could be more during the peak season.

During the peak season, the daily arrivals of tomato stocks at the Madanapalle market alone would be about 1,200 tonnes and in the lean period, it drops to below 300 tonnes.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/llbfzy/article32823380.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJTOMATO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/madanapalle-tomatoes-for-chennai-by-rail-from-next-week/article32823381.ece

Chennai can breathe easy as the Kandaleru reservoir in Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh, which augments the drinking water supply to the metropolis, has attained a record storage of 52.94 tmcft for the first time since the launch of the Telugu Ganga canal system in 1996.

Tamil Nadu can expect to get its full quota of Krishna water this year as the storage in the reservoir is expected to go up further in the coming weeks to reach closer to its full capacity of 68.05 tmcft.

It was in the year 2010 that the reservoir had a relatively comfortable storage of 50.65 tmcft against the full capacity of 68.05 tmcft.

Once the farm season begins in November, the water realised from Kandaleru by Tamil Nadu will come down a bit to about 600 cusecs from the present 800 cusecs, after accounting for evaporation losses and seepage.

91,2020/10/10,TUs decry curbs on utilisationof building workers’ fund,"Round-table urges State government urged to withdraw the order

Trade unions, led by CITU East Godavari chapter, on Saturday urged the State government to withdraw the abeyance order on the utilisation of welfare fund of the AP Building and Other Construction Workers’ Board (APBOCWW).

At a round-table conference attended by the representatives of the trade unions -- AITUC, AICCTU, INTUC -- here on Saturday, a resolution was passed to intensify the protest against the abeyance order and the GO. No. 17 that directs the APBOCWW to transfer ₹450 crore to the State government.

CITU East Godavari district general secretary Ch. Raj Kumar said that such curbs on the utilisation of the funds available with the APBOCWW would deprive the facility of claiming the benefits entitled to the registered workers. This move by the State government was violation of the existing welfare laws. The benefits include financial aid for medical treatment, wedding, risk coverage in the event of accident, natural death and disability.

“The APBOCWW generates the fund by collecting workers’ cess from the builders and fee paid for registration. The fund should not be transferred to the State government as it is meant for the welfare of the registered workers,” pointed out Mr. Raj Kumar.

The trade union leaders alleged that claims made by the eligible workers under various schemes of the APBOCWW to the tune of ₹5 crore were not settled even after over 18 months. INTUC district president T. Raju, AICCTU district president P.N. Rarasa Raju, CITU district president M. Veera Lakshmi and other trade union leaders were present.

101,2020/10/10,"Sand scarcity hits construction industry in Vizianagaram, Srikakulam districts","Thousands of labourers lost livelihood both in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts.

Construction industry has been hit very badly both in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts with the non availability of sand. Hundreds of constructions were virtually stopped in two districts with the scarcity of sand. Sources say, it is currently available only in black-market only. A lorry load of sand value is between ₹12,000 and ₹14,000 in normal days depending on the distance of the stock point and place of the construction. Each lorry can carry 10 tonnes of sand and it is calculated as two and half units. However, each lorry load’s cost has gone up to ₹30,000 in the black market. Many individual persons stopped the construction as they are unable to buy sand in the black-market.

“Earlier, the sand transport is allowed from ramps in bullock-carts. The small quantity used to help local persons who are constructing their houses and small shops. Now, the administration has banned it, leading to stop the construction activity,” said a business person of Srikakulam. “There is no supply through online booking also. We have been waiting for two months. The government should look into the issue since it would have impact on labourers also,” he added.

Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India-AP Chapter General Secretary KCS Bose urged the government to ensure supply of sand at all levels to protect the construction industry. “Thousands of labourers, electricians, welders, painters and others lost their livelihood with the inordinate delay in supply of sand. The government also losses revenue since construction industry pays direct and indirect taxes in many ways. The revenue of Registration and Stamps department also comes down significantly,” he added.

In fact, the government decided to give top priority for local supply. However, it is not being implemented in spite of many ramps located at many rivers including Nagavali, Vamsadhara, Mahendra Tanaya and others. According to sources, too many restrictions and supply through stock yards instead of from ramps and other reasons led to the delay in supply of sand. It takes more than one and halfs for supply of sand after submission of applications through online.

CITU Vizianagaram District President G.Appala Suri and General Secretary T.V. Ramana alleged that more than 25,000 labourers and others lost livelihood with the ‘wrong 'sand policies of the government. The officials said that non availability of sand sufficiently in ramps was the main reason for the delay in supply for the applicants.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sand-scarcity-hits-construction-industry-in-vizianagaram-srikakulam-districts/article32819910.ece

104,2020/10/10,Pandemic taking a tollon mental health: expert,"‘Isolation and uncertainty are adding to the problems’

Lockdown for several months, loss of jobs and uncertainty in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic has created a sense of insecurity among the people. Apart from the monetary loss, the fear of contracting the infection, the impact on gloobal economy and career prospects of students remain the worrying factor.

The ongoing National Mental Health Week and the World Mental Health Day-2020 shceduled to beobserved on October 10 assume significance against this backdrop.

“The pandemic has affected all. The world is experiencing global health emergency due to COVID-19, which has also an impact on mental health. Measures such as social distancing and restrictions on public movement, isolation and uncertainty are causing anxiety, fear and emotional stress in people,” says Sudha Rani, Superintendent of Government Hospital for Mental Care.

World Mental Health Day

The theme for the World Mental Health Day-2020 decided by World Federation for Mental Health is “Mental Health for all - Greater investment, greater access to everyone and everywhere”. Studies conducted by the WHO point out that there has been an increase in mental health issues across the globe. Around 450 million people are suffering from various mental disorders. Every year, one adult in every four and one child in every 10 are suffering from mental health issues, thus affecting millions of lives.

These mental health issues affect the capability of individuals to cope up with their daily living, way of sustaining relationships and working ability. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youths in the age group of 15 to 29 years. One person is dying by suicide in every 40 seconds.

Heathcare services

“Only 15% to 20% of people with mental illness are able to get treatment and this gap can be attributed to poverty, poor awareness and social stigma. Awareness and increasing the access to meantal healthcare are the needs of the hour. Given the pandemic situation, no one should be denied of mental healthcare,” says Dr. Radha Rani, who is also a professor of psychiatry.

The common mental health problems are anxiety, depression, phobias, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. One can maintain a good mental health by adopting measures sich as giving time for self, participating in recreational activities, exercise, yoga and meditation, good diet and sleep and maintaining good relationships with family and friends, she explains.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pandemic-taking-a-tollon-mental-health-expert/article32817378.ece

Farmers belonging to Aadi Andhra Tenants Cooperative Society, at Oleru, filed a petition stating that the supporters of the two leaders had been illegally mining huge quantities of sand on the “lanka lands” in the fertile river beds for the last three months. The farmers, represented by Meruga Devadanam and Bussa Suguna Raju, said that they had submitted representation of River Conservator, Vijayawada, State Pollution Control Board, Deputy Director, Mining and Collector, Guntur, but no action had been taken so far.

Oleru village, situated near Repalle, is located downstream of Prakasam Barrage. In 2009, a breach at the sluice gates in the village caused enormous flooding and submerged many villages and Repalle town. Later, the sluice gates were repaired.

106,2020/10/10,Snake-catchers having a field day in Chittoor dist.,"Reptiles thriving in residential areas due to wild growth, lack of activity

Wild growth in vacant areas and lack of activity due to the COVID-19 lockdown for a few months has led to a sudden growth of snake population in rural and urban (mostly outskirts) habitations in Chittoor district. The man-snake conflict has yielded unexpected dividends for many snake-catchers but hundreds of reptiles are getting killed in the process.

The presence of lizards and frogs in stagnant water amidst the wild growth near residential localities has attracted snakes to the habitations. The thick vegetation that resulted from the copious rains since June and lack of maintenance activity by civic authorities owing to the pandemic situation and staff shortage helped turn these environs into safe havens for reptiles, according to a forest official.

In the Chittoor Municipal Corporation people of several divisions on the outskirts and abutting hillocks are sighting snakes regularly while Srikalahasti and Vedam village offer a regular spectacle of snakes invading houses and getting killed. The problem is also serious in the newly developed municipalities of Nagari and Puttur and Kuppam.

However, a majority of the snakes killed are non-poisonous ones like rat snakes. There are also instances of killing cobras, vipers and pythons. “Due to public fear, we just can’t interfere in the matter. We prefer the issue to be overcome naturally over a period of time,” says the official.

Prize catch

Amidst the new found demand for snake-catchers, a woman from Kalyanapuram in Puttur mandal has turned into a household name since a couple of months ago. “I have killed 23 snakes, including 16 cobras, at various localities in Puttur town in a month. Killing four cobras in a day is the highlight. As it’s a dangerous game, I charge a flat ₹2,000 for each snake,” she claims.

When a cobra enters a house, it will be near impossible to track it, says a snake-catcher at Satyavedu. “Unlike other snakes, it hides in holes and corners without movement for a couple of days. In some cases, the search will go on for a couple of days. We charge ₹5,000 per snake in such conditions,” he adds.

107,2020/10/10,Grade Aarogyasri network hospitals treating COVID patients: CM,"‘Patients must be admitted within half an hour of their arrival at the hospital’

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has directed the Health and Medical Department to ensure that the best healthcare is provided to COVID-19 affected persons at the Aarogyasri Network Hospitals across the State. The Chief Minister said installation of CCTV cameras was mandatory at all the hospitals.

During a review meeting held at his camp office on Friday, Mr. Jagan said that helpdesks should be set up at the hospitals and Arogya Mitras should assist the families of patients in getting admission, and explain about the facilities at the hospitals. They should also ensure that the patients were admitted within half an hour of their arrival at the hospital.

The Chief Minister reiterated that basic facilities, availability of doctors, drugs, food, sanitation and Arogyamitra would be the six parameters on which the hospitals would be judged and ranked. He asked the health and medical department to focus on providing all the necessary medical care and support to the patients.

“I want you to ensure that ‘104’ call centre is working round the clock and the Collector should do a mock drill every day. A bed should be provided within half an hour of the patient coming to hospital and for those in home isolation, ANMs should visit them regularly. Grading should be completed in all Arogyasri hospitals within the next 15 days and if the hospitals are not providing basic services, they would be removed from the panel,” MR. Jagan said.

The officials said that the positivity rate of COVID-19 had decreased. “The state leads the country in testing and we have got to a stage where we are doing 35,680 RT-PCR tests and 8,890 Truenat tests daily, which is half of tests we are doing. We have also created facilities for mobile testing in 135 buses. We have 38,042 beds in 252 hospitals and 5,000 ventilators. So far, we have recruited 10,000 nurses on a permanent basis and 20,000 nurses on temporary basis. So far, we have conducted tests on 63.49 lakh persons, and the positivity rate is 11.65 per cent,’’ said Special Chief Sesretary, Medical and Health Department, K.S. Jawahar Reddy.

110,2020/10/10,Texport Garments factory staff seek minimum wage,"4,000 workers on stir since October 5

Around 4,000 employees of the Texport Garments factory in the Hindupur industrial estate close to the Karnataka border, have been agitating since October 5, seeking minimum wages of ₹18,000 per month as recommended by the Centre.

On the fourth day of the agitation on Friday, the Left parties including the Communist Party of India (Marxist), its trade union wing Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and Communist Party of India (CPI) leaders staged a dharna in front of the tahsildar’s office and submitted a memorandum to the tahsildar, seeking resolution of the ongoing industrial dispute in the three units of the Texport Garments.

Addressing the workers, CITU State president Ch. Narasinga Rao said that the Centre had passed a law making ₹18,000 as the minimum wage all over the country, but this was not being implemented in many industries.

“The $80-million Texport company with several garment manufacturing units across the country pays the lowest wages to the Hindupur unit workers, with an average of ₹6,000 per month,” he said.

He also alleged that the working conditions for the women employees at the unit was very bad and they were paid somewhere between ₹5,000 and ₹7,000, depending on how many days they worked.

The company is granting additional pay only when they work on all 26 working days in a month, said Mr. Narasinga Rao.

He said the Jockey garments factory in Karnataka, just 2 km away from this industrial cluster on the other side of the inter-State border, paid ₹12,000 per month. “The Joint Commissioner of Labour Department has promised to hold a joint meeting of the management, workers and the department to discuss the wage revision issue,” he said.

111,2020/10/10,Crop coverage drops in Prakasam despite good rain,"Acreage falls short by 12% during kharif season

With 46 rainy days, the drought-prone Prakasam district registered 40% excess rainfall till October first week, after a gap of several years.

Added to this, major reservoirs in the Krishna basin, including Nagarjunasagar which irrigates over 1.60 lakh hectares in the district, were filled to the brim. Despite this, the crop coverage during kharif season fell short by 12% in the rain-fed district for various reasons.

The Agriculture Department is leaving no stone unturned to make up for the shortfall during winter, as both kharif and rabi cropping seasons overlap in the district, which had been in the grip of drought for several years in the past, including a 15% deficit rainfall during last year. The district recorded a rainfall of 548.3 mm as against the normal rainfall of 456.6 mm.

Bengal gram, the pulse crop grown as an alternative to tobacco, is likely to see a surge in acreage during Rabi this year in the wake of the Tobacco Board's decision to cut down on tobacco cultivation in the traditional tobacco growing areas in the district in view of the depressed global market condition for the principal commercial crop.

Overseeing registration of the names of ryots at the Rythu Bharosa centres for distribution of subsidised seeds, Agriculture Joint Director P.V. Sriramamurthy said farmers should switch over to alternatives like jowar, black gram, etc., as they might burn their fingers if they grew bengal gram in more than the normal acreage of about 80,000 hectares during winter.

With 23,336 hectares under paddy, the coverage was 98% during kharif thanks to the good inflow into Krishna Western Delta and Nagarjunasagar Right Bank branch canals this year. However, the area under red gram, the principal pulse crop grown during kharif, fell to about 80,000 hectares, a dip of 13% over the normal extent.

The overall pulse crop coverage, including black gram, green gram and horse gram, was 88% of the normal acreage 1,00,000 hectarea, according to a report compiled by the Agriculture Department. Cotton cultivation was taken up in 31,671 hectares so far as against the normal extent of 38,210 hectares and chilli in 25,612 hectares as against normal acreage of 28,598 hectares.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/crop-coverage-drops-in-prakasam-despite-good-rain/article32817023.ece

118,2020/10/10,Excessive rain creates shortage of onions,"If supply does not improve, price could go up to ₹120 a kg

Excessive rain in parts of the State in August and September led to large-scale crop damage that has now caused a severe shortage of onions, driving its price northwards.

“The supply of onions has dropped to unprecedented levels. Crop loss was reported from almost all onion growing regions of the State starting from Sira, Molakalmur and Hubballi to Belagavi. What has worsened the situation is a similar crop loss in Maharashtra and Telangana as well,” said Ravi Kumar of Bangalore Onion and Potato Traders’ Association.

Onions are currently being traded at ₹40 a kg in the wholesale market, which has already pushed the retail price to above ₹50, sometimes even being sold at ₹60 a kg. However, despite paying a steep price, the quality of onions is poor.

“Waterlogging and increased soil moisture have damaged the crop hugely,” Mr. Ravi Kumar said.

All hopes are pinned on the next harvest from Rajasthan, which is expected to reach the market in November–December. If that fails, it will create a long period of acute shortage till the next harvest in February, warn traders.

“If the Rajasthan crop is not adequate, we may see onion prices cross the ₹120 level, but then too, the quality may be very bad,” Mr. Kumar said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/excessive-rain-creates-shortage-of-onions/article32823537.ece

120,2020/10/10,Karnataka HC comes to the rescue of class 12 student,"CBSE had asked her to reappear for biology paper; board directed to declare result.

Observing that “a tender age student, even when delinquency is established, cannot be treated as an offender of the war crime,” the Karnataka High Court has directed the CBSE to immediately announce the result of a student of class 12, who was asked to reappear for an exam in one of the subjects without announcing the result for carrying a mobile phone inside the examination hall on March 14.

Justice Krishna S. Dixit passed the order while allowing a petition filed by Shuchi Mishra, who had appeared for CBSE Class 12 main examinations in Bengaluru. The court directed the CBSE to immediately announce the results of biology subject.

The court, from the records, found that the petitioner had inadvertently carried mobile phone inside the exam hall and had handed it over to the invigilator just before commencement of the exam, but the CBSE had treated her case as “unfair means” for “using mobile phone during examination.”

“The student’s assertion that she had deposited the mobile at 9.55 a.m., that is prior to commencement of examination, to the centre invigilator becomes evident by the fact that it was sent to her school, which was in turn delivered it back to her after examination and on the same day,” the court observed.

The court also noted the CBSE committee had not made any effort to view video footages of the exam hall as every hall was under electronic surveillance and had denied personal hearing to the student.

Pointing out that there was no allegation that the petitioner had clandestinely stored the examination material in the said phone for making “unfair use” of the same, the court said, “though a student is expected not to carry such instrument into the exam hall but human fallibility, more particularly in case of children going to exam with associated anxiety needs to be kept in mind as an extreme penalty cancelling exam violates the rule of proportionality and it shakes the consciousness of the court, to say the least.”

Observing that “tender minds, even when they commit significant mistakes, cannot be treated with iron gloves”, the court said that “one cannot be oblivious to the anxiety of the students and their parents during the crucial examination of the kind, especially during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic; carrying mobile phone instrument during such difficult periods by anyone admits rationalisation. Even in court halls, mobile phones of counsel ring often loudly despite repeated instructions to keep them in idle mode; that is not a case of serious culpability; an argument to the contrary would be abhorrent to notions of reasons and justice.”

As the petitioner became ineligible to take compartment exam owing to non-declaration of result in biology subject coupled with her failure in maths subject, the court directed the CBSE to announce result in biology and organise necessary exam for her, if eligible otherwise, in same syllabi by December 31.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/n3jomo/article32823401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10KRAKARHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-high-court-comes-to-rescue-of-class-12-student-who-carried-phone-inside-exam-hall/article32823402.ece
121,2020/10/10,Director Vijay passes away,"He directed some of the biggest hits of Dr. Rajkumar

Veteran film-maker B. Vijaya Reddy, better known as Vijay in the Kannada film industry, passed away in Chennai on Friday. The 84-year-old is most remembered for his collaboration with Dr. Rajkumar to deliver some of his super-hit films.

He is survived by wife, two sons, and two daughters. “He was ill for some time now and hospitalised. He suffered a cardiac arrest on Friday evening and passed away,” said his son B. Nagi Reddy.

Hailing from Tadepalligudem, West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, he went to the then Madras seeking to become an actor, but later worked as a technician and eventually turned film-maker. He debuted in Kannada with Rangamahal Rahasya, a thriller in 1970, which became a runaway hit.

His big break came when M.P. Shankar selected him to direct Gandhada Gudi in 1973, for which Shankar had written the story himself. The phenomenal success of the film kicked off a long association with Dr. Rajkumar, with whom he went on to make nine films. He was also all set to direct Bhakta Ambareesha with Dr. Rajkumar in 2000, but the film got shelved due to health issues of the late actor. Puneeth Rajkumar tweeted condolences on Saturday, remembering his days when he acted as young Prahlada in Bhakta Prahlada.

Vijay also directed several other leading men of Kannada cinema — Anant Nag in Naa Ninna Bidalare, Shankar Nag in Auto Raja, which made the late actor-director a mass hero, and Vishnuvardhan in Deva, among others.

Vijay was not only one of the most prolific, but also one of the most successful film-makers of Kannada of the 1970s and 1980s. “Whatever he made was a massive hit and he came to be known as a man with the Midas touch. But it was his extreme hard work that made him successful,” said producer K.C.N. Chandrashekhar. He produced the Dr. Rajkumar-starrer Huliya Haalina Mevu that Vijay directed. “He traversed several genres of cinema — mythological, historical, social, adventure and thrillers — with great ease. Most of his films were not only massive hits of his times, but have also aged well. His screenplays were tight and had the right amount of emotion. I remember being blown away by his debut film Rangamahal Rahasya, a fine thriller,” observed Puttaswamy, a Kannada film critic and historian.

“The narratives of Kannada cinema history often only celebrate Puttanna Kanagal, Siddalingaiah and those who worked in parallel cinema, but tend to neglect the contribution of film-makers like Vijay who sustained the industry with their hits. Most of the films Vijay made are identified with the stars, not giving enough credit to him,” Mr. Puttaswamy said.

Vijay floated a production house — Vijaya Shekhar Productions — with another director V. Somashekhar and went on to produce several films.

122,2020/10/10,NHAI to fund widening of underpasses at ORR,"Peripheral Ring Road too may become a reality soon in Mysuru

The widening of underpasses where the railway track and the Outer Ring Road (ORR) intersect at four places, helping in reducing the risk of accidents, may become a reality years after it was proposed by the Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA).

For, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Saturday was apprised of the imperatives of the task.

The ORR bisects the Mysuru-Bengaluru railway line, Mysuru-Hassan line, Mysuru-RBI printing press line and Mysuru-Nanjangud railway line. Though the 42.5-km-long ORR is a six-lane road and is currently managed by the NHAI, the road barrels into a two-lane stretch as it approaches these underpasses. This not only slows down the traffic but poses a risk to the motorists, especially at night.

I.K. Pandey, DG (Projects), Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, who was in the city inspected the ORR on Saturday. Mysuru MP Pratap Simha and MUDA Chairman H.V. Rajiv were present. The two told Mr. Pandey of the need for widening the underpass at the earliest in the interest of the public.

The project is pending since more than 6 years but there are issues pertaining to its execution and funding. Though all rail underpasses are handled by the railway authorities, lack of clarity on the funding mechanism has delayed its implementation. But ever since the MUDA handed the ORR to NHAI for maintenance, the latter is expected to fund the project and fast track its execution. Mr. Rajiv said a proposal for a grade separator at the KRS Road and ORR junction was also discussed and Mr. Pandey has assured them of taking up the works on a priority basis.

The works assumes significance in view of the increase in traffic along the ORR and the imperatives of removing the bottlenecks created by the narrow stretch at the underpass.

Mr. Rajiv also sought NHAI support for the peripheral ring road (PRR) proposed by the MUDA. He said the ORR is already attaining saturation level of traffic and it was imperative to think of the future and ensure traffic diversion by creating a PRR.

The proposed PRR is expected to come at a distance of 6 to 7 km from the existing ORR and will have a length of 106 km. Mr. Rajiv said the PRR may require approximately 600 acres and the NHAI MD has sought a detailed project report before it could be approved for funding.

The PRR was conceptualised in the Mysuru Master Plan-2031 and was first announced by the MUDA in 2016. The alignment of the PRR has already been drawn in the master plan but may require tweaking and the existing roads connecting the hinterland may have to be broadened.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nhai-to-fund-widening-of-underpasses-at-orr/article32821935.ece
123,2020/10/10,The positives and negatives of Vidyagama,"124 teachers contracted COVID-19 and five died since August in Mysuru district; one teacher succumbs in Chamarajanagar

Even as the Vidyagama initiative has been temporarily halted in the State over the COVID-19 scare, as many as five teachers have succumbed to the disease in Mysuru with 124 testing positive to the infection since August. One teacher's death has been reported from Chamarajanagar.

Sources in the Department of Public Instruction claimed that the COVID-19 deaths among the teaching community in Mysuru took place before and also after the launch of Vidyagama while arguing that the programme should not be solely blamed for the spread of the infection among teachers.

However, the teaching community working in the government schools is perturbed after the reports of their colleagues contracting the infection during an exclusive testing ocnducted for teachers here in anticipation of the reopening of schools.

The spread of infection led to a debate here on whether the programme should be suspended for now as a precaution until the cases recede in the interest of students and the teaching community.

The COVID-19 cases have crossed 40,000-mark in Mysuru with 7,467 active cases as on Friday. In total, 862 persons have died due to the infection, which is second highest after Bengaluru. The cumulative positive cases as on Friday were 41,058.

Mysuru district alone has over 9,000 teachers, including from the high schools and primary schools. As of now, nearly 6,000 teachers had undergone the COVID-19 test (Rapid Antigen Test) conducted for free by the Health Department on the department’s request and the remaining were expected to be tested in the next few days.

Mysuru was among the foremost districts to subject the government school teachers to mandatory testing in anticipation of reopening of schools with the Centre lifting the restrictions. However, the State government, after growing concerns expressed by the parents and the public in general, has made it clear that the schools were not reopening now with cases on the surge.

When contacted, Uday Kumar, Education Officer, DDPI Office, Mysuru confirmed the cases and said most infected teachers are under home isolation. Five deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred since August. Many teachers have already recovered. Barring one taluk, 124 teachers had tested positive in eight taluks in the district.

In Chamarajanagar district, 35 teachers had tested positive and31 had recovered. Those in hospitals had been discharged and only three are in hospital till date. A teacher died of COVID-19 in the district. Chamarajanagar taluk reported 23 cases, which was the highest in the district, and the least was reported from Hanur where one teacher was infected, according to DDPI Jaware Gowda.

While no deaths had occurred in Kodagu, 44 cases had been reported in the coffee district. A total of 32 teachers have already recovered.

DDPI P.S. Machado said four schoolchildren from the aided schools had contracted the infection. Kodagu has 1,439 teachers from 467 schools.

If the decision to suspend Vidyagama for the time being has brought relief to teachers, with some of them even on COVID-19 duty as well, apprehensions were expressed since the beginning of the programme over teachers as well as children being exposed to the risks of contracting the infection.

The teachers had been told to engage in teaching visiting the community as many children, especially those in rural areas, were not able to afford online education, and such children should not be deprived of education. The outcome was positive as it kept the children engaged besides bringing more admissions to the government schools which had been shut down since last two years.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/the-positives-and-negatives-of-vidyagama/article32821857.ece
124,2020/10/10,"Telangana, Goa trying to create new problem over water sharing: Ramesh Jarkiholi","Says he had spoken to Union Minister Shekhawat on the issue

Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi has accused Telangana and Goa of trying to create a new controversy over the sharing of Krishna and Mahadayi waters and said the State government would not allow injustice to be meted out to Karnataka in this regard.

In a press release issued after a telephonic talk with Union Minister of Water Resources Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, he said that the State government would present its arguments effectively before the Union government and the Supreme Court.

Mr. Jarkiholi has said that Telangana was trying to create make an issue out of Krishna river water sharing on which the tribunal had already given its final verdict in 2013. “Already water share has been allocated to Karnataka, Maharashtra and the earlier united Andhra Pradesh. The Union government too has decided to notify the verdict after the Supreme Court verdict. At this point Telangana’s plea for setting up a new water disputes tribunal is illogical”, he has said.

The Minister has said in the release that he had discussed in detail the issue with the Mr. Shekhawat following the plea by Telangana. During the telephonic conversation he had urged the Union Minister not to bring Karnataka into the differences between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

As the water requirements of Telangana had already been considered as it was part of the united Andhra Pradesh, Telangana had to get its share from Andhra Pradesh and various Supreme Court orders too were clear in this regard. Considered these facts, the two States should sit together and sort out the differences in water sharing through dialogue. The demand for a new tribunal was certainly not a justifiable one, Mr. Jarkiholi had told the Union Minister, the release said.

Mahadayi

Regarding Mahadayi, Mr. Jarkiholi has termed the contempt petition by Goa government as ludicrous. “Already the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal has given its final verdict and the Union government too has notified the verdict. It is really funny that the Goa government has now filed a contempt of court petition against Karnataka”, he has said in the release.

Terming the photographs and videos released by Goa as fabricated documents, Mr. Jarkiholi has said that Karnataka would face the charges effectively in the Supreme Court . He has said that he had received a factual report on the ground situation from the committee comprising senior officials of Water Resources Department from both the States.

Mr. Jarkiholi has said that the argument of Goa that Karnataka had illegally diverted Mahadayi waters could not be accepted. Meanwhile Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa too had written an emergency letter to the Union Water Resources Minister urging him to facilitate utilisation of the allotted share of water to Karnataka, the Minister has said in the release.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/telangana-goa-trying-to-create-new-problem-over-water-sharing-ramesh-jarkiholi/article32821049.ece
125,2020/10/10,Temporary halt to ‘Vidyagama’ scheme,"Opposition from various quarters over health issues forces govt. to act

The State government has decided to stop the ambitious ‘Vidyagama’ scheme, albeit temporarily.

The scheme, a continuous learning plan for children in government and aided schools in the State, was launched by the Education Department around two months ago in the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic.

However, since its launch, there has been widespread opposition from various quarters. Recently, communities in M. Thimmapur village near Ramdurg complained that 30 students had tested positive for COVID-19 over the past few days. They had alleged that students had contracted the virus while attending classes conducted by teachers in open public spaces as part of the ‘Vidyagama’ scheme.

Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar announced that the officials of the department had been directed to stop implementing the scheme until a proper analysis of pros and cons is complete. He stated that the scheme was launched for the benefit of children belonging to lower socio-economic backgrounds.

Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy has also been vocal in opposing the scheme. In a series of tweets, he alleged that the State government was risking the lives of both teachers and students.

Concurring, Basavaraj Gurikar, president of Karnataka State Primary School Teachers’ Association, said the scheme should be scrapped. “Nothing is more important than the health of children. The government should focus on health, rather than implement such schemes that only risk the lives of teachers and students,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/luhai2/article32826203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGVIDYAGAMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/temporary-halt-to-vidyagama-scheme/article32820927.ece
126,2020/10/10,Woman gives birth in forest at night,"She was walking to hospital as her village lacks connectivity

Lack of connectivity to the remote hinterland of Chamarajanagar came to the fore again when a woman gave birth to a child in the middle of the forest even before she could be shifted to hospital.

The incident took place on Thursday night when Kamala, who experienced labour pain, was walking from her house at Aneholla village towards the nearest hospital taking the forest route in the M.M.Hills Wildlife Sanctuary. The nearest hospital was at a distance of 5 km from the village and Kamala was accompanied by her husband Veeranna. But en route, Kamala developed severe pain and could no longer walk and went into labour.

Veeranna left both the mother and the child in the middle of the forest and went to fetch help from the nearest village. The local people arranged for a goods vehicle which reached the spot and helped shift Kamala and her child to the hospital.

Doctors said both were in good health. The issue was brought to the notice of the Forest Department staff who said there are a few hamlets where ambulance cannot go due to difficult terrain. The normal practice of the local community was to shift pregnant women to a hospital a few days before the delivery date to avoid such complications.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/woman-gives-birth-in-forest-at-night/article32820559.ece
127,2020/10/10,Bhyrappa wants Dasara confined to homes,"Even a gathering of 200 persons as recommended by the COVID-19 committee is not essential, says novelist

Novelist S.L. Bhyrappa on Saturday said the Dasara fete in Mysuru should be confined to households instead of public celebrations and expressed reservations over allowing even a small gathering for the events in the midst of the pandemic.

Speaking to reporters here, he suggested restricting the festivities to households, temples and the palace, without permitting public participation.

Responding to the COVID-19 technical advisory committee’s report, he questioned the necessity of allowing even 200 persons (for the inauguration atop Chamundi Hills).

He, however, endorsed Dasara illumination but added that the authorities must ensure no crowding takes place in the city during the festivities.

On the Jamboo Savari at the palace, the novelist sought to know the need for allowing the public since the major task of conducting the procession with the elephant carrying the ‘ambari’ is done by the mahouts.

To a question, Mr. Bhyrappa said the people should not worry about losing business without the usual celebrations. “Who will take the responsibility when thousands are allowed to gather and the infection spreads,” he asked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bhyrappa-wants-dasara-confined-to-homes/article32820444.ece
128,2020/10/10,COVID-19 committee suggests virtual Dasara fete this year,"Not more than 200 persons for inauguration of festivities atop Chamundi Hills on October 17, and only 300 persons for Jamboo Savari on October 26 at the palace

The COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has recommended limiting to 200 the gathering for the inauguration of Dasara festivities atop Chamundi Hills on October 17 and 300 for Jamboo Savari on the palace premises on October 26, taking all mandatory COVID-19 precautions.

The number of persons recommended for participation includes officials, staff on duty, artists and security personnel having valid passes from the district administration.

Importantly, the Health Department’s TAC has recommended to the Mysuru district administration to organise a safe, virtual Dasara for the public this year in view of the pandemic.

The committee headed by Dr M.K. Sudarshan, which inspected the Dasara venues on Friday, has also recommended that the cultural events at the palace for eight days from October 17 to 24 should be limited for two hours a day by local artists and the participation not exceed 50.

As far as the Dasara illumination is concerned, the TAC wants the police to be posted at the strategic places here to prevent crowding and for checking wearing of face masks by all. The illumination at select areas from October 17 to 26 will be from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.

The TAC, including Dr. Mohammad Shariff, member secretary, and member Dr. Lokesh Alahari were in Mysuru on the instructions of the Commissioner of Health and Family Welfare. They met Deputy Commissioner Rohini Sindhuri and other officials, before making their recommendations.

Dr .Sudarshan, in his report to the Health Department, said the COVID-19 fatality rate in Mysuru is 2.1 per cent and test positivity rate is 17 per cent (as on October 8). Mysuru stands next to Bengaluru in terms of disease burden and fatality. Dasara is internationally acclaimed, celebrated with pomp and gaiety. But this year, in the context of pandemic, it cannot be celebrated the way it used to be and a lot of safety measures are necessary to ensure continuation of tradition and cultural activities simultaneously ensuring the events are COVID-19 safe.

RT-PCR negative test report (done after October 14) should be made mandatory for all participants at the venues. The test for officials, staff, security personnel, media persons, artists and others should be made compulsory, the committee recommended.

The TAC suggested that the artists and other performers should be preferably from Mysuru and other districts of Karnataka. Besides all recommended precautions at the venues, persons with symptoms of cough, cold, fever, sore throat, difficulty in breathing etc., should not be allowed at the venues.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-committee-suggests-virtual-dasara-fete-this-year/article32819989.ece

130,2020/10/10,Bypolls | COVID-19 patients can vote through postal ballot,"Polling in Sira, R.R. Nagar segments is scheduled for November 3.

To ensure that none misses out on voting in the bypolls amid the pandemic, the Election Commission has extended postal ballot facility for voters with physical disabilities, those aged above 80, and active COVID-19 positive patients or suspected patients who are either in institutional or home quarantine.

The bypolls to Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly segments are scheduled for November 3.

Those eligible Active COVID-19 patients

Those suspected to have COVID-19

Physically challenged persons

Those aged above 80

A circular from the office of the Chief Electoral Officer, Karnataka, said that voters coming under these three categories have time till October 13 to apply for postal ballot. The returning officer will make arrangement to deliver the postal ballot and collect the same before the date fixed for the polling – November 3.

The release added that the application for the postal ballot should be accompanied by a copy of certificate/instructions from competent health authorities that says that the applicant is hospitalised in the State or in quarantine within the State — home or institutional — on account of COVID-19. The elector, the release added, will be intimated in advance about the date and time of visit by poll officials. Such intimation may be given through SMS, by post and/or through booth-level officers.

The provision for voting through postal ballot for COVID-19 patients was first extended by the Election Commission of India for the upcoming Bihar elections. Following recommendation by the poll panel and subsequent amendments by the Law Ministry in October last year, voters with physical disabilities and those aged above 80 are allowed to vote through postal ballot.

According to Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s Special Commissioner (Administration) J. Manjunath, who is also the Additional District Election Officer for Rajarajeshwarinagar bypolls, poll officials have already identified 696 people with disabilities and 5,660 people aged above 80 who were eligible to vote in the bypolls.

“With new cases being reported every day, the number of active COVID-19 patients is a dynamic figure,” he said.

To be hand-delivered

The 381 booth-level officers (BLOs) will be assisted by a separate team constituted to hand deliver the 12D form to those eligible for postal ballot.

Health officials, who are in touch with active COVID-19 patients, will assist the BLOs in the activity, Mr. Manjunath said.

“Once the voters indicate that they will opt for postal ballot, we will mark it in the voters’ list. This way, they will not be allowed to vote on the day of the polling in the booths. This will also help check proxy voting,” he said, and added that all requests would be reviewed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1yuc2j/article32817567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGPOSTAL1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bypolls-covid-19-patients-can-vote-through-postal-ballot/article32817568.ece
131,2020/10/10,‘Vidyagama not leading to infections’,"Unfortunate that a good initiative is being portrayed in poor light: Minister

Amid reports that over 23 children in Belagavi and four in Kalaburagi districts had tested positive for COVID-19 after attending Vidyagama, a continuous learning programme for children of government schools, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar on Friday said children who tested positive were “not infected because of attending Vidyagama” and that the initiative was “safe”.

It was reported that over 23 children from Timmapura village in Belagavi district and four students from Mashala village in Kalaburagi district tested positive after attending Vidyagama programme held on a temple premises and a school campus, respectively.

“In Timmapura village, many villagers, including 23 children, have tested positive. The Deputy Director has clarified that there is no basis for the argument that the children got infected because of Vidyagama,” Mr. Kumar said. The Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Belagavi, told The Hindu that the students were asymptomatic and that the head master and teachers had tested negative.

Reacting to media reports on cases in Kalaburagi district, Mr. Kumar said that on September 22, 203 students from Mashala village were tested on random sampling basis out of which four tested positive.

“However, even there the Deputy Director has said that the students did not contract the virus on the school campus where Vidyagama was conducted as minimum number of students participate in the programme with necessary precautions,” he said.

Mr. Kumar said that it was unfortunate that a good initiative like Vidyagama was being portrayed in poor light.

However, there have been reports on concerns about COVID-19 precautions, including wearing masks and social distancing, not being followed during Vidyagama. Basavaraj Gurikar of the All India Teachers’ Federation urged the government to stop Vidyagama as it violated various COVID-19 precautionary measures and rules.

132,2020/10/10,"Corporation status depends on census figure, says Hassan MLA","Move possible if the 2021 census figures crosses three lakh mark.

Hassan MLA Preetham J. Gowda has said Hassan city municipal council could be updated to a corporation once the population in its limits increases to three lakh. If the population census to be held in 2021 showed the figure, Hassan could become a corporation.

Speaking at a press conference, here recently, Mr. Gowda said the State government had brought in 25 villages located on the outskirts of the city under the ambit of the City Municipal Council. With this the population in the city limit would stand at 2.26 lakh, as per the census held in 2011.

Revanna’s comments that the proposal to include villages was submitted in his period, he said the proposal was rejected by the State government. “The earlier proposal was not in the prescribed order. The fresh one was submitted and was approved by the government”, he said. He commented that the JD(S) leader had the habit of claiming credit for all development works of the district. “He could claim credit even for Hoysaleshwara Temple at Halebidu or Bahubali statue at Shravanabelgola.” Further, he said the State government had sanctioned a project worth ₹ 165 crore to improve the underground drainage in the city. This was necessary to avoid filth reaching the Yagachi, which had been declared one of the polluted rivers. “Mr. Revanna, despite having clout in previous governments, could not get the project sanctioned.

133,2020/10/10,Notification of reservation on ULB posts leaves Janata Dal (Secular) agitated,"The posts of presidents in both ULBs have been reserved for Scheduled Tribes and the only party that has members to suit the reserved category is the BJP.

The notification of reservation for the posts of presidents and vice presidents in urban local bodies has left the JD(S) in Hassan agitated. Despite winning the highest number of seats in Hassan City Municipal Council and Arsikere CMC, it cannot hold power in either of the bodies.

The posts of presidents in both ULBs have been reserved for Scheduled Tribes and the only party that has members to suit the reserved category is the BJP. As a result, the BJP will assume power in Hassan CMC and Arsikere CMC.

In the elections held in September 2018 for the 35 wards of Hassan CMC, the JD(S) won 17 sets, the BJP won 13, the Congress two and Independents won three. The JD(S) was confident of holding power with the support of Independents. In Arsikere, of the 31 seats, JD(S) won 22, BJP won five, Congress won one, and Independents won three seats. The JD(S) was sure of holding power there too. However, the reservation notified by the government keeps the party out of power.

Former Minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Revanna, at a press conference in Hassan on Friday, said both the national parties were afraid of the JD(S). They had been engaged in all forms of tricks to keep the JD(S) away from power. “The post of Harihar CMC president was initially reserved for the ST. However, it was changed overnight. The courts should take note of this injustice. The BJP is doing what the Congress did in the past,” he alleged.

Mr. Revanna said the party would fight the issue legally. During the last ZP elections, when the Congress was in power, the post of Hassan ZP president was reserved for the Scheduled Tribe, to accommodate a Congress member, while the JD(S) had won more seats.

Earlier in the day Arsikere MLA K.M. Shivalinge Gowda of the JD(S) also held a press conference to criticise the BJP government on this issue. He termed it murder of democracy.

“The State government had made a mistake. Chief Minister Yediyurappa has fallen under the influence of vested interests,” he said.

In a democracy, the party should have a majority to come to power.

But, the government’s notification had allowed the party with fewer seats to take over to the urban local body, he said and added that he would fight the case in court.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6edsul/article32817509.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGREVANNAMYSURUP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/notification-of-reservation-on-ulb-posts-leaves-janata-dal-secular-agitated/article32817510.ece
134,2020/10/10,Civil contractors stop MCC work over dues amounting to ₹120 cr.,"The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) Civil Contractors’ Association has resolved to stop the civic body’s works in protest against the failure of the authorities to clear their long-pending dues.

The cash-strapped MCC had accumulated dues for over three years, amounting to ₹120 crore. The association’s representatives said they had decided to suspend all the civil works of the MCC after their repeated meetings and appeals to the authorities to clear the dues had not yielded any result.

Association president Chandrashekaraiah said that dues in several cases were pending since 2017. Most of the contractors had taken loans from banks and private financiers to carry out the works while many others had pending dues to clear for the construction material they had taken to complete the works.

The contractors had come under immense pressure to clear their dues and it has become extremely difficult for them to lead their lives, lamented Mr. Chandrashekaraiah in an appeal submitted to Mayor Tasneem.

Though they had met the MCC Commissioner on several occasions, the latter only offered assurances, but not clear the dues. “Hence, we have suspended all works of the MCC from October 3,” he added before urging the Mayor to take steps to expeditiously clear their pending dues and pave the way for resumption of civil works of the MCC.

General works amounting to a total of ₹86.42 crore are pending from May 2017 including ₹20.54 crore from 2017-19, ₹45.51 crore from 2018-19 and ₹19.36 crore from 2019-20. Similarly, ₹31.68 crore is pending towards underground drainage (UGD) works since October 2016 including ₹19.5 crore due from the works executed in 2018-19 alone.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/np7yig/article32817495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGMYSURUTASNEEM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/civil-contractors-stop-mcc-work-over-dues-amounting-to-120-cr/article32817496.ece

The COVID-19 War Room in operation in Mysuru to contain the infection in a ‘combat mode’ is in immediate need of volunteers to assist the pandemic situation.

The war room was established at the Town Hall to assist those testing positive. The number of persons testing positive has gone up with the ramping up of testing.

The Mysuru City Corporation and the Department of Health and Family Welfare have jointly operated the war room for the past four months.

After an upsurge in cases and also deaths by COVID-19, the district administration, the MCC and the Health Department have evolved an action plan to contain the pandemic. As a part of it, 22 testing centers had been set up across the city.

MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde said those testing positive at the centers would be given assistance, including shifting cases that require hospitalization. The staff at the war room will make arrangements so that they do not face any inconvenience and get proper guidance.

As the war room is in need of more staff to coordinate and assist in triaging of infected persons and COVID-19 management, the MCC has planned to rope in volunteers. Those wishing to work as volunteers can call the MCC control room on 0821-2418800, 0821-2440890, 0821-2418816, 9449841196, or the MCC Environment Officer on 8105739384.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/war-room-looking-for-volunteers/article32817494.ece

With more than 67,000 people aged under 20 infected with coronavirus and a high number of COVID-19 cases being reported across the State each day, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah has suggested to the government not to reopen schools till the situation is brought under control.

He has suggested to the government to make arrangements to continue online classes and promote students to higher classes this academic year.

Responding to a letter from Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar, the former Chief Minister quoted government data and said 20,256 children aged below 10 and 47,061 students aged between 11 and 20 had been infected. Sixty-one children had succumbed to COVID-19, he said. The number of cases were increasing with increased number of tests and this had created a panic situation, he said.

On the Minister’s concerns on increasing child marriages and child labour on account of closure of schools, the Congress leader said the district administration must provide work and financial support for weaker sections of society. Reopening of schools was no solution to address the problems of child labour and child marriages, he added. COVID-19 situation had aggravated after reopening of schools in Europe and the U.S., he said.

A total of 24,527 deaths were reported in the State during July–September 2020 as against 16,670 deaths during the same period in 2019. About 7,857 more deaths were reported this year in the three months, he said, and alleged that the government had been covering up mortalities related to COVID-19.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/7zjts0/article32763800.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03bgbgnagsiddGVD7QQ4TV3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/siddaramaiah-asks-govt-not-to-reopen-schools/article32817454.ece

138,2020/10/10,"After months, air passenger traffic from Mysuru on the rise","Most of the flights from here are carrying almost 50% of their capacity

The air passenger traffic originating from Mysuru is beginning to pick up for the first time since the COVID-19 threw everything out of gear across all sectors.

There are 12 flight movements at the Mysuru airport daily and the authorities say most of the flights carry almost 50% of their carrying capacity.

Only ATR flights with 72 seat capacity can operate out of Mysuru given its short runway (1,740 meters). However, only flights with fares subsidized by the government under UDAN are operating. The scheme was introduced to provide flight connectivity to tier 2 and tier 3 cites so as to spur economic growth and lure more investments to the region.

A non-UDAN flight was introduced from Mysuru to Chennai last November which underlined the growth in air passenger traffic from Mysuru and the potential to harness it. But it took a hit with the pandemic and the flight service was withdrawn and is yet to be restored.

Airport director R. Manjunath said all the six flights - to and from Mysuru - were recording atleast 50% passenger occupancy. In some cases, the occupancy rate was higher. There are flights from Mysuru to Chennai, Bengaluru, Kochi, Hyderabad, Belagavi and Goa. “This is a far from the scenario that prevailed two months ago when there used to be handful of people on a single flight,” said Mr. Manjunath.

Though the Mysuru-Chennai sector is popular, flights are not operating daily and will become a daily service from the last week of October, according to Mr. Manjunath.

However, stakeholders in the tourism sector – which too has taken a hit – aver that situation is far from returning to normal and only people with business interests and official work were flying. “We don’t see many tourists and the surge in COVID-19 cases will further delay the resumption of normal tourism activities,” stakeholders added.

But they agree that the gradual increase in passenger traffic since September compared to June/July is an indication that business and economic activity was gaining traction. But it is going to be a longer wait for the tourism sector to attain the pre-COVID-19 days’ level of footfall.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wong0n/article32817408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGMYSURUAIRTRAFFIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/after-months-air-passenger-traffic-from-mysuru-on-the-rise/article32817409.ece

140,2020/10/10,Jarkiholi’s meeting with Fadnavis fuels rumours,"Irrigation Minister and BJP leader Ramesh Jarkiholi’s meeting with Devendra Fadnavis, former Maharashtra Chief Minister, has caused speculation that the BJP is trying to topple the Shiv Sena-led alliance government in the neighbouring State.

Mr. Jarkiholi, who claimed to have engineered the resignations of over 20 Congress MLAs to aid B.S. Yediyurappa become the Chief Minister last year, met Mr. Fadnavis in Mumbai on Thursday, the day when BJP national president J.P. Nadda was in the city to address party workers.

Mr. Nadda’s statement that the BJP was bound to form a government and install Mr. Fadnavis as the Chief Minister in Maharashtra further fuelled rumours. This is the second time in less than a month that the two leaders are meeting. Mr. Jarkiholi had met Mr. Fadnavis in a private hotel outside Mumbai in the last week of September.

Congress leaders in Belagavi district suspect that the BJP may be trying another season of ‘Operation lotus’ and using Mr. Jarkiholi’s “experience” for the purpose. “Mr. Jarkiholi has several friends among the Congress and NCP MLAs in Maharashtra. He has long-standing business relations with some owing to their interest in sugar factories and molasses business. Some others have been introduced to him by his brothers-in-law Ambirao Patil and Appirao Patil who hail from Maharashtra,” said a Congress leader.

“The BJP may be trying all kinds of tricks to come to power. But they will not succeed. The coalition government in Maharashtra is very stable,” said Satish Jarkiholi, KPCC working president and brother of Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi.

BJP leaders, however, said there was no such plan. “We are carrying out the role of a constructive Opposition in Maharashtra and we are not doing anything to dislodge the government there,” said Sanjay Patil, BJP district unit president

Some farmers’ leaders have questioned Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi’s “haste” in visiting Maharashtra for political reasons. Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi’s sojourn has also faced criticism.

“The Minister has not rushed to Maharashtra to resolves issues of flooding in the Krishna basin or the water sharing disputes of the Krishna or the Mahadayi, despite repeated requests from farmers’ organisations,” said Jayashree Gurannanavar, a farmers’ leader.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jarkiholis-meeting-with-fadnavis-fuels-rumours/article32817292.ece
141,2020/10/10,"Exclusive library for COVID-19 patients in Sagar, Shivamogga","The move by Health Department is aimed at helping patients overcome distress and anxiety during isolation.

The COVID-19 hospitals located at Sagar and Shivamogga have got an exclusive library for patients. This initiative by the employees of the Health Department is to motivate those in COVID-19 wards, who are often in distress or anxiety as they have no access to relatives and friends.

A library was first set up at the sub-divisional hospital at Sagar and the second library was inaugurated at McGann Hospital in Shivamogga on Friday. Ma.Sa.Nanjundaswamy, the president of District Health Department Employees Union, who works as an X-ray technician at Sagar hospital, took the initiative to set up the library. Initially, he and his colleagues contributed 100 books and now with the help of donors, the number of titles has increased to 500.

“As I work in the hospital, I have noticed many patients feeling lonely, dejected and worried about their health. Through the day they were disappointed as they could not meet their loved ones. I thought good books and newspapers could give them a good company so that they could relax,” said Mr. Nanjundaswamy. He chose books that could motivate people. The collection includes Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture, a few biographies of achievers and religious books like Bhagwad Gita, and the Holy Quran, among others. “We have not got funds from the government for this activity. Our staff, taluk health officers, surgeons, medical officers and elected representatives have contributed books,” said Mr. Nanjundaswamy.

The second library has been set up at COVID-19 ward at McGann with the support of the director of the medical college and other staff. C.S. Shadakshari, president of Karnataka Government Employees’ Association, inaugurated the library on Friday. “Soon we will collect more books and strengthen the library.

The COVID-19 fatality rate in Chamarajanagar that saw a big jump in the number of active cases recently, has dropped to 1% from 1.8%. The number of deaths was high among those between 40 and 60 years.

The mortality rate that stood at 1.8% last month came down to 1.27% in the last 15 days and it dropped further to 1.02% until last week. In the last five days, the fatality rate fell to 1%.

Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi said the death audit was studied and strategies were worked out with the help of doctors to contain the fatalities. The reasons for spurt in deaths were analysed and steps taken accordingly, showing the results, after a rise in cases and deaths noticed over the last two months.

Mr. Ravi said the testing target had been exceeded with 1,250 tests being done almost every day as against the target given by the State at 950 tests a day. The ramping up of testing led to rise in cases and the contacts of the infected persons are being tracked effectively to contain the spread.

An 80-bed COVID-19 Care Centre has also started functioning in Chamarajnagar since Monday, the DC said, adding that persons between 40 and 60 years should not neglect symptoms and take appropriate precautions considering the fatality rate among this particular age group.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jd5337/article32817258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGP2RAVI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-death-rate-drops-in-chamarajanagar/article32817259.ece
143,2020/10/10,"Coronavirus | Most districts in Karnataka exceed RT-PCR test targets, but fail in RATs","None of the districts achieved more than 75% of their target.

Last month, in a span of five days, Mysuru had a positivity rate of 22%. Out of 100 persons tested for COVID-19, an average of 22 returned positive between September 17 and 23.

As per the data available on testing from 15 districts, including Mysuru, none of the districts achieved the target set for carrying out Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT). Ramanagaram did the highest — 79% of the RAT target — while the lowest was Chitradurga (8%). Mysuru achieved 32% of the RAT target — 1,424 tests as against the target of 4,400 RATs.

The September statistics on testing in Mysuru worried the district administration even as the cases surged alarmingly, resulting in Minister for Medical Education K. Sudhakar and Minister for Health B. Sriramulu rushing to Mysuru to take review of the situation. After Bengaluru, Mysuru is the second hotspot identified by the Centre over the alarming surge in cases. Besides the number of cases, the death count is also high in Mysuru.

However, when it came to RT-PCR and other methods of testing during the same period, most districts, including Mysuru, exceeded their targets.

Surprisingly, Chitradurga, whose RAT target was just 8%, achieved 295% of the target in PCR in the same period. As against the target of 300, it conducted 886 tests. Haveri achieved 180% the target with 540 tests.

Overall, 800 PCR tests was the target set to most districts, while Dakshina Kannada was given a target of 1,000 for the period.

Mysuru conducted 922 PCR tests, against the target of 800, while Dakshina Kannada conducted 1,174 tests (117%). The lowest numbers on the PCR front came from Bengaluru Rural (62%).

Hassan and Chikkamagaluru also exceeded their PCR targets, carrying out 824 and 568 tests, respectively, achieving 189% and 118% their targets.

Data from the 15 districts — Mysuru, Bengaluru Rural, Chikkamagaluru, Hassan, Haveri, Dakshina Kannada, Belagavi, Mandya, Chitradurga, Ramanagaram, Davangere, Ballari, Tumakuru, and Shivamogga — shows an average of less than 20% positivity rate.

In this period, the positivity rate was highest in Bengaluru Rural (24%), followed by Mysuru (22%). In other districts, it was less than 20%.

145,2020/10/10,Youth hacked to death in Thrissur,"He was an accused in a murder case

Less than a week after the murder of a 26-year-old CPI(M) leader, another youth was brutally killed by an armed gang at Anthikkad in the district on Saturday.

The police identified the deceased as Nidhil, alias Appu, 28, son of Udayan of Koottala, near Muttichur. He was an accused in the murder of a youth, Adharsh, at Anthikkad. Nidhil, who was released on bail a week ago, was returning after reporting at the Anthikkad police station.

He was attacked in front of the Vattukulangara temple on Muttichur Road around 11 a.m. The gang members rammed their vehicle into the car in which Nidhil was travelling. They dragged Nidhil out and hacked him repeatedly. Though the police took him to the Thrissur Medical College Hospital, his life could not be saved.

The gang members escaped in another vehicle that came the way. Incidentally, Nidhil was attacked at the same spot where Adharsh was attacked.

Adharsh of Thannyam, near Anthikkad, was murdered in July this year. Enmity between between two criminal gangs was suspected to be the motive behind the murder. Nidhil was the eighth accused in the murder case. Nidhil allegedly helped the killers escape after the murder.

Irinjalakuda DySP Famous Varghese is in charge of the investigation. The police reportedly took one person into custody in connection with Nidhil’s murder.

Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party State president K. Surendran alleged that the Communist Party of India(Marxist) was behind the attack. He said Nidhil was an active worker of the BJP.

Talking to mediapersons, Mr. Surendran demanded an investigation into the role of Minister A.C. Moideen in provoking CPI(M) workers in unleashing violence against Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and BJP workers.

146,2020/10/10,"Now, UAVs make a statement in Kerala farms too","Deployed for fertilizer application in Wayanad

The dearth of skilled workers following the lockdown restrictions, especially deploying manpower, has affected farming operations and put the farm community in a fix. However, the Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) at Ambalavayal under the Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) has found a solution in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).

The KVK conducted a UAV-based demonstration of fertilizer application for farmers at the Kolavally Padashekharam in Mullankolly grama panchayat in Wayanad on Saturday.

The application of ‘Sampoorna’, a micronutrient for rice cultivation, using an UAV was first of its kind in Wayanad and it evoked curiosity among villagers.

During these challenging times, mechanisation and measures to reduce the number of labourers at the same time and enhancing precise farming techniques to maximise production are called for, says Allan Thomas, head, KVK.

The extended time of operations and labour cost are the major issues affecting the agricultural sector. Both these issues are solved by the UAV, mostly called drone technology, that gives a new face to agricultural mechanisation, says Dr. Thomas.

UAVs have multiple applications in agriculture such as measuring nutrient levels, yield map, weed control. UAVs are significant where they replace labour-intensive and potentially harmful use of backpack sprayers and similar equipment, he says.

It reduces the risks of human spraying also. The manual spray takes around half-a-day per acre at a cost of ₹500 to 600 while a UAV takes around 5-10 minutes to spray an acre at a cost of ₹800 .The cost can be reduced by employing the equipment in a large area. Another advantage is that it is GPS enabled and ensures precise application of the mixture, says Dr.Thomas.

The height of flight, speed of drone, and fertilizer quantity were set by a group of scientists of the KAU consisting Aparna Radhakrishnan, K.P. Shivaji, V.P. Indulekha, and Sanju Balan.

147,2020/10/10,Cleanliness is a development gauge: CM,"‘Clean’ status for 559 local bodies

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday declared ‘clean’ status for 501 grama panchayats and 58 municipalities as part of the 100-day action plan.

Making the declaration at an online conference, he said the initial plan was to declare at least 250 local bodies as clean, based on them satisfying a set of conditions, but more than double that number had been achieved in the period. All grama panchayats in as many as 30 block panchayats had achieved the status.

The clean status is awarded to local bodies based on a set of parameters, including mechanisms for waste treatment at source, material recovery facilities, segregated collection, and recycling of non-biodegradable waste. The Haritha Keralam Mission and the Suchitwa Mission had anchored the activities.

Mr.Vijayan lauded the local bodies that managed to achieve the status even when they were weighed down with a slew of responsibilities due to COVID-19 and the floods in successive years.

“Cleanliness is the gauge which shows the level of development in a state. Even if you attain development in all sectors and people still have to shield their noses while walking the streets, it will be a huge setback for the State’s developmental aspirations. For the local bodies too, even amid all the other major responsibilities, the primary responsibility is sanitation. The Haritha Keralam Mission was formed to coordinate all such activities with mass participation. More local bodies are expected to achieve this status this month itself,” the Chief Minister said.

He said there had been a change in the attitude of the general public due to the grass-roots level campaigns taken up by the local bodies. The practice of throwing waste by the roadside had come down considerably in recent years. “But, not all of the waste can be processed in a decentralised manner. For this, decentralised waste treatment plants are needed,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cleanliness-is-a-development-gauge-cm/article32823725.ece

The Kerala State Electricity Board has said that more than half its 1.3 crore customers are paying their bills online and that it is offering more services online to avoid people visiting its offices against the backdrop of the pandemic and make the services transparent and smooth.

Board sources say about 53% of remittances in fees and electricity bill payments, accounting for about 50% of the customers, are being done online. It is a relief in terms of physical visits to electricity section offices for the customers at the time of COVID-19, when resources are stretched and there is pressure on service providers.

A customer wanting electricity connection will now be able to submit her/his application online without having to go to the section office. They can change ownership of connection, change tariff rate, shift connected load, and shift phases using the online facilities.

Applicants will be able to follow up the progress of the application submitted to the KSEB through short message service or e-mail.

The board has also facilitated services in such a way that consumers can now take meter reading in containment zones. The reading and the photo of the electricity meter can by uploaded on the board site after which the consumer will receive the bill.

In the meanwhile, the board has launched, on a pilot basis, a project for providing ‘service at doorstep’. The project has been launched in Palakkad and is expected to be extended to other districts with improvements in the near future, the sources said.

A customer will now be able to make a call to the KSEB prescribed number and become its customer without having to go the local office. From a new connection to change in ownership of the connection can now be done online with KSEB officials visiting the premises at the convenience of customers.

All fees can be paid online and verification of documents will be done on the spot when board officials visit the site.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday congratulated a girl from Kerala who sang a Himachali song, which has gone viral on social media. He shared a video of a news report about the Class 9 student in his Twitter handle and praised her for her melodious voice.

“I am proud of Devika. Her melodious rendering strengthens the essence of ‘One India, Great India’,” the Prime Minister said in his tweet in Malayalam, sharing the report telecast by a Malayalam news channel.

His tweet came a day after Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jairam Thakur shared the video of Devika from Thiruvananthapuram singing ‘Chamba kitni ki door’ on his Facebook wall and said she had “won the hearts of the entire State”.

Devika, a student of Kendriya Vidyalaya at Pattom in Thiruvananthapuram, had sung the song under the ‘Ek Bharat Shreshth Bharat’ programme.

Customs on Saturday invoked the provisions of the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities (COFEPOSA) Act against Sandeep Nair and Swapna Suresh, the key accused in the diplomatic baggage gold smuggling case.

The national advisory board of the COFEPOSA approved the proposal submitted by the investigating team. The accused can be detained in prison for one year under the provisions of the Act. The Customs had decided to impose the Act after it found that the accused were involved in smuggling on multiple occasions.

Sivasankar interrogation

The interrogation of M. Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in connection with the gold smuggling case continued for the second consecutive day at the Customs office here. He appeared before the officials at 10.30 a.m. The interrogation was progressing at the time of filing of this report.

“We may have to question him for a day or two more as certain clarifications are required,” said a top source from the department. He said they were trying to corroborate certain “technical evidences” with him.

“However, considering that there were cases pertaining to the import of dates, the Koran and previous instances of suspected gold smuggling, senior officials of other departments will also have to be questioned and not just the officials,” the source said.

151,2020/10/10,Work on Kazhakuttam flyover progressing,"The ₹195 crore flyover project has a length of 2.34-km and is coming up on 60 piers

Nearly 45 per cent work of the upcoming 2.7-km four-lane flyover at Kazhakuttam for hassle-free entry to Technopark has been completed.

The 12 slabs in the initial 1.7 km from Technopark to Kazhakuttam of the flyover that will pass along the National Highway (NH) 66 and the NH 66 Bypass extending to Karode on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border had been completed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).

With the government handing over the land in the remaining one km stretch from Kazhakuttam, the NHAI is in the process of demolishing the buildings in the surrendered land and expediting the work of flyover being executed as a standalone project. “The demolishing of the remaining three buildings is to be completed next week,” a NHAI official said.

Due to the delay in handing over the land, the NHAI had begun the work on the 1.7-km stretch from Technopark to save time. The delay was over acquiring land on the stretch from Kazhakuttam for a Right of Way (RoW) of 45 m for the flyover.

The Kochi-based Cherian Varkey Construction Company that had bagged the work for ₹195 crore on April 5, 2019 and continued with the work during the lockdown is facing hurdles to expedite the work as the traffic is not being diverted. Traffic diversions as promised by the authorities had not taken place and this will hamper works, he said.

Initially, it was decided to have a 1.4-km flyover. Later it was decided to go for a 2.34-km flyover that will terminate near the Kazhakuttam police station. The decision to extend it up to CSI Mission Hospital was taken considering the Kazhakuttam station of the proposed 21.82-km Light Metro corridor from Technocity to Karamana; convention centre on the stretch; future traffic volume with urbanisation; and the four-laning of the Kazhakuttam-Cherthala NH 66 corridor.

The flyover, the longest in the capital on commissioning, is to come up on 60 piers, each 30 m apart. Only three piers are pending, the official said. The pillars coming up in the median along the four-lane NH 66 will have a diameter of four metre and the main carriageway will be 21 m.

The four-lane flyover is being executed under the Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) mode.

152,2020/10/10,COVID-19 | Kerala CM calls for more effective measures for containment,"‘Epidemic curve may hit the peak in coming weeks’

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has stressed the need for more effective disease containment measures in the coming weeks so that the epidemic curve does not hit the peak too soon, resulting in more fatalities.

Addressing media persons here on Saturday, he said the test positivity rate was remaining high even when the number of tests had been increased substantially and that this was an indication that the epidemic curve would continue to rise in October-November.

He claimed the State had successfully managed to keep the epidemic extended, without hitting the peak so that the surge was below the health system capacity and the case fatality rate could be kept down.

The State's interventions in disease containment has helped create a lag in the pace of the epidemic, giving the State adequate time for preparedness, he claimed.

However, the past eight months have taken a toll on health-care workers in the State, who are very much fatigued. Though the COVID Brigade had been created for aiding the health-care workers, doctors of modern medicine who have joined the brigade is only 543. This was the time the State and society needed the service of doctors and they should come forward to join the fight against the pandemic, he said.

Mr. Vijayan again reminded people to take over the responsibility of keeping themselves protected against the disease, by following all safety precautions. Approximately 30% of those who recovered from COVID-19 were found to be having prolonged and lingering systemic effects of the disease, with 10% of the patients suffering from serious long-term after-effects. Hence, it would be dangerous to harbour the misconception that it was better to contract COVID and acquire natural immunity, he said.

In Thiruvananthapuram, women seemed to be crowding malls and supermarkets and this had resulted in more women contracting the disease.

In Malappuram, renal patients undergoing dialysis, who contract the disease, were being denied dialysis services and this would invite strict action from the government.

All private hospitals should set aside one dialysis machine exclusively for COVID patients and a dialysis patient who is SARS-CoV-2 positive may be referred to the Manjeri Medical College only in dire situations, the Chief Minister said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1zpzzf/article32825995.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tvcovid,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-kerala-cm-calls-for-more-effective-measures-for-containment/article32822922.ece
153,2020/10/10,"1,310 positive cases in capital","1,288 get infection through local transmission, 20 health workers infected

Thiruvananthapuram registered a record single-day surge of COVID-19 cases on Saturday when 1,310 tested positive for the infection. The day’s caseload has far surpassed the previous highest count of 1,182 reported on October 7.

The death toll due to the pandemic also jumped to 297 with nine more people succumbing to the disease. Those who died including natives of Poovachal (aged 51 years old), Manacaud (79), Kuruvilpuram near Kallikadu (70), Kovalam (82), Peroorkada (60), Poovachal (47), Pettah (76) and Thirumala (61).

The death of prominent fishing community leader T. Peter, who hailed from Valiyaveli, has also been included in the list. He had died in the Government Medical College Hospital here on October 8.

As many as 1,288 out of those who tested positive during the last 24 hours contracted the infection through local transmission. The health authorities were yet to trace the source of infection in 226 cases among them. Twenty health workers have also been infected.

Cases continued to grow among the vulnerable age groups with 193 senior citizens aged above 60 years and 142 children below 15 years getting the disease. The number of active COVID-19 cases in the district stood at 12,127 on a day when 905 people were discharged after recovering from the disease. While 4,483 people were directed to go into quarantine on the day, the number of those who are currently being monitored for COVID-19-related difficulties is 31,510.

Pointing out that the COVID-19 situation remained grave, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan during his briefing said that the mounting case burden in the capital district witnessed a greater number of women contracting the illness. He pointed to the possibility of women frequenting markets and shopping malls in large numbers as the reason behind the trend.

While reiterating the importance of auto and taxi drivers ensuring the constant use of face masks and hand sanitisers, the Chief Minister also urged them to consider wearing gloves and face shield for improved protection. He also appealed to the public to exercise caution while using public transportation.

In view of the permission granted to commercial establishments to function, Mr. Vijayan directed shop owners to maintain availability of soaps and hand sanitisers for customers.

Panic gripped the Museum police station in the city where three officials tested positive, taking the total number of police personnel affected to 29. Authorities deployed staff from other stations and wings to ensure the activities of the station remained unaffected.

Meanwhile, the district administration formally launched the Santhwana Sparsham scheme to undertake COVID-19 testing at the homes of bed-ridden people who have registered for palliative care.

District Collector Navjot Khosa inaugurated the programme on the occasion of World Hospice and Palliative Care Day on Saturday. District Medical Officer K.S. Shinu presided over the function.

156,2020/10/10,No move to centralise executive power with CMO: Pinarayi,"Refutes media report suggesting opposition from Cabinet colleagues

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday denied a media report that the government had moved to concentrate executive power with the Chief Minister’s Office by amending the rules of business that govern day-to-day administration.

He also termed mere speculation a suggestion in the news report that at least four of his Cabinet colleagues and coalition partners had objected to the move.

Panel formed

Mr. Vijayan said that on December 28, 2018, the government had constituted a committee comprising five top bureaucrats to examine the rules of business, single out anomalies, if any, and recommend revisions if necessary.

On August 26, 2020, the Cabinet considered the set of recommendations tabled by the committee of bureaucrats. It decided to constitute a Cabinet subcommittee to study the proposals in detail.

Members

The Cabinet nominated Law Minister A.K. Balan as convener of the subcommittee. It named Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan, Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran, Minister for Ports Kadannappally Ramachandran, and Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty as members. The subcommittee was yet to submit its report.

The newspaper report had suggested that the coalition Ministers had objected to any amendment to the rules of business because they feared it would undermine their authority and concentrate executive power with the Chief Minister and heads of departments. Mr. Vijayan said the report was mere speculation.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had said any alteration of the rules of business would undermine democracy and bolster authoritarianism. It would do away with checks and balances in the system and promote the arbitrary exercise of executive power.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-move-to-centralise-executive-power-with-cmo-pinarayi/article32822395.ece
157,2020/10/10,No talks on seat allocation: Joseph,"KC(M) leader dismisses rumours about Cong. taking over seats

Amidst speculation over the Congress set to take over some of the Assembly seats of the Kerala Congress (M) in view of the exit of Jose K. Mani-led faction, party working chairman P.J. Joseph on Saturday asserted that a status quo with regard to the division of seats would be maintained.

Addressing media persons in Kottayam to announce the party's plan to hold dharnas at all district headquarters on October 14 seeking a universal pension of ₹10,000, Mr. Joseph said the coalition had not commenced any discussions with regard to the allocation of seats to constituent parties.

“We do not think the Congress would ask for any seats, where KC(M) has been contesting traditionally. There is no change in the situation from the previous election when KC(M) had contested in 15 Assembly seats. While Mr. Mani and few others left the party, a large number of State and local level leaders, including Francis George, Johny Nellore, Joseph M. Puthusseri, have joined our ranks,” he said.

Continuing his tirade against Mr. Mani, Mr. Joseph termed the faction led by the MP as a boat adrift on the sea. “It may capsize at any moment as nobody will accept a ship that is about to sink. While Mr. Mani had earlier stated he will announce its political stance on Friday, they are still unsure about the future course of action,” Mr. Joseph said.

Earlier, Mr. Joseph had alleged that Mr. Mani was eyeing a birth in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. Lending strength to his speculation was a statement by the BJP State president K. Surendran that he had expected the Mani group not to join the LDF for the time being.

The report, however, drew a sharp rebuttal from the Mani group, with N. Jayaraj, MLA, accusing Mr. Joseph of misleading the public. “Mr. Joseph's statement that he has got this information from the BJP leaders itself shows his close connections with that party, the MLA said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tkmbjr/article32823641.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DIL3620,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-talks-on-seat-allocation-joseph/article32822356.ece
158,2020/10/10,CM asks Natesan not to devalue SNGOU,"Defends appointment of Mubarak Pasha as Vice Chancellor

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday said SNDP Union general secretary Vellappally Natesan should refrain from attempting to devalue the social stature of the Sree Narayana Guru Open University (SNGOU) by faulting the government for not appointing a person from a particular caste or community to the post of the Vice Chancellor.

He said academic qualification and administrative experience were the sole criteria for the appointment. The government had purposely chosen to honour the legacy of the guru by naming the university after him. It was no coincidence.

The government had received universal acclaim for venerating the life and work of the seer as a social reformer and renaissance leader who pointed Kerala in the direction of social progress and enlightenment.

Moreover, the guru had batted for a casteless secular society and stressed the value of knowledge in his writings and teachings. His teachings had resonated strongly among a large section of people who were denied education and remained marginalised for centuries. Guru's stress on the importance of learning had liberated them.

Mr. Vijayan read out the names of Vice Chancellors of other universities in the State. The government had nominated them based on merit. It had not favoured one caste or community over the other. Mr. Natesan's reaction had surprised him. The SNDP union leader had misunderstood the spirit of the decision, and he should rectify his stance.

Mr. Natesan had on Friday slammed the government for not appointing a member from the ‘Sree Narayana community’ to the post of the Vice Chancellor and choosing P.M. Mubarak Pasha instead.

He had singled out Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel for choosing a ""non-resident Keralite"" from ""Malabar"" as the head of the university. Mr. Natesan had accused the government of stabbing the ‘Sree Narayana devotees’ in the eye and sacrificing their welfare to appease some vested interests.

BJP State president K. Surendran had backed Mr. Natesan and said the government had sacrificed the interests of the majority community.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cm-asks-natesan-not-to-devalue-sngou/article32821942.ece
159,2020/10/10,Nod for light vehicles to ply on Sabarimala road,"Works on damaged road yet to begin as e-tender receives no bid

Though the repair works of the road leading to Sabarimala are yet to begin, the authorities have decided to permit light vehicles along the road when the temple opens on October 16 for the Thulamasa puja.

The plan to restore the road, which was damaged in the heavy rain in August, was dealt a major blow with the e-tender floated by the Public Works Department receiving zero bids. Following this, the agency has tendered the works once again, which will open on October 13.

“If the response continues to be lukewarm, the works will be awarded directly,” said Sheena Rajan, Executive Engineer, PWD(Roads) Pathanamthitta.

The stoppage of traffic through the route has considerably affected the preparations at Pampa and the Sannidhanam for the upcoming pilgrim season. However, light vehicles carrying officials of the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) and the police still ply along the road.

20 bathing facilities

Because of a ban on the bathing of pilgrims at Pampa, the authorities will set up 20 bathing facilities at Pampa-Triveni. While the Irrigation Department will install sprinklers and related plumbing works, the Kerala Water Authority will ensure water supply.

The TDB has been asked to ensure that waste water does not enter the river or other waterbodies. The Health Department and the board have been entrusted with the sanitation works in Pampa. The entire activities will be coordinated by the Revenue Department.

As part of implementing the plan, a team of Thiruvalla Subcollector Chetan Kumar Meena visited the location on Saturday.

Officials said the showers and the make-shift bathrooms would be set up in line with the physical distancing guidelines. Water discharged from these facilities will be stored in a tank and diverted to the waste-water treatment plant.

Sprinklers at Erumely

Kottayam Collector M. Anjana has directed the TDB to install a new set of sprinklers at Erumely to ensure that waste water from these showers are not discharged into the Valiyathodu, a stream that opens to the Manimalayar.

Pilgrims have been also prohibited from staying overnight at the stop-overs (Idathavalams) en route to Sabarimala, including Erumely.

160,2020/10/10,BJP in damage control mode,"Participation of Smitha Menon in foreign ministers’ meet

The participation of a public relations professional, Smitha Menon, in an event for foreign ministers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has turned to be an embarrassment for the BJP Kerala unit when the party was seeking the resignations of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the gold smuggling case and Minister for Higher Education K.T. Jaleel for protocol violations.

The controversy surrounded the alleged breach of protocol by Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan for helping Ms. Menon to participate in the the 19th meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) held in Abu Dhabi in November last.

Incidentally Ms. Menon is also the State secretary of the Mahila Morcha, an affiliate of the BJP.

The issue cropped up after Saleem Madavoor, president, Loktantrik Yuva Janata Dal, brought a complaint to Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on the participation of Ms. Menon at the conference of foreign ministers of the IORA, an organisation of 22 member-countries and 10 other dialogue partners. He had also sought to conduct an inquiry on the “breach of protocol” by the Minister.

However, Mr. Muraleedharan and State BJP president K. Surendran had clarified that no violation of any protocol had been committed in this regard. Also, Ms. Menon had clarified that she had attended the meeting as a mediaperson and that too on her own expenses to report the event.

Putting up a sturdy defence, Mr. Surendran also went on to clarify that he had recommended her name for the post in Mahila Morcha and that more professionals would be included into the BJP and its feeder outfits. He said that Ms. Menon belonged to a Sangh Parivar family.

Notwithstanding these damage-control exercises, the issue has given the anti-Muraleedharan camp in the BJP to whip up overtly and covertly the controversy. Except Mr. Surendran, no prominent leaders from the rival camp, came out in support of Mr. Muraleedharan.

The episode emerged when the BJP was intensifying its agitation against the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government with much-clamoured slogans of anti-corruption on various fronts, including the gold smuggling case.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bjp-in-damage-control-mode/article32821890.ece

163,2020/10/10,KMML to get more oxygen self-reliant,"CM inaugurates a new 70 TPD plant

Kerala Minerals and Metals Limited (KMML) has become self-reliant in oxygen production with the new 70-tonne per day (TPD) plant inaugurated online by Chief Minister Pinaryi Vijayan on Saturday.

“Along with the oxygen needed for industrial purposes, the plant will also cater to the health sector making the new facility extremely advantageous under current circumstances,” said the Chief Minister in his inaugural address.

He added that the government had been implementing comprehensive renovation and upgrading works in public sector since chemical industry in the State had great possibilities. “A mineral separation unit was installed at the KMML at the cost of ₹10 crore after LDF government came into power. While the KMML had registered a profit of ₹3 crore in 2015-16, in 2017-18 the profit jumped to a record ₹151 crore. In 2018-19, the profit was ₹163 crore and even in the midst of a severe crisis, the unit achieved a profit of ₹42 crore in the 2019-20 financial year,” he said.

When commissioned in 1984, the production capacity of Titanium dioxide Pigment (TP) unit in KMML was 22,000 tonnes. A 50-TPD oxygen plant corresponding to the demand was also commissioned along with the unit, but the pigment production capacity of the unit considerably escalated around 1999-2000. When it reached 36,000 tonnes per year, the oxygen plant fell inadequate to meet the 63 tonne per day demand, and by this time the capacity had come down to 35 tonne from the original 50. After this, the KMML had to buy 26 tonnes of oxygen per day from other manufacturers to meet the surge in demand and since then, the KMML has been spending around ₹12 crore per year for purchasing oxygen.

The new completely automatic 70 TDP plant with high energy efficiency was completed with Rs 50 crore including Rs 4 sanctioned for civil works. If the production cost of one tonne oxygen in the earlier plant was Rs 7,000, the new plant can produce the same quantity with Rs 4,500. There is also a huge difference in energy consumption as the new plant has brought it down to 850 units per tonne from the earlier 1,200. The oxygen plant purifies, liquefies and separates air into industrial gases and the oxygen and nitrogen produced have high market value. The plant will produce 63 tonne oxygen, 70 tonne nitrogen, 7 tonne liquefied oxygen and nitrogen every day. The liquid oxygen produced at the plant can be used for medical needs and now KMML can augment medical oxygen supply if the health sector faces any shortage.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kmml-to-get-more-oxygen-self-reliant/article32821757.ece
164,2020/10/10,Showcasing students’ talents in digital form,"‘Digi Showcase’ will have students’ works stored into separate albums for each school

People around the world have come up with new ideas to shake off the COVID-19 blues. With the First Bell and White Board digital classes in full swing in the State, students, including the differently abled, have taken up academic and creative activities to drive away frustration, boredom, and anxiety during this troubling period.

The Thiruvananthapuram South urban resource centre (URC) under the Samagra Shiksha, Kerala, is showcasing digitally all the works created by students, including the differently abled, in the Thiruvananthapuram South educational sub-district.

The ‘Digi Showcase,’ which was launched recently, targets digital education for students and teachers to overcome the challenges posed by the pandemic.

The works, be it song, dance, painting, or any other activity, will be stored into separate albums for each school and class so that these can provide a lasting memory of the pandemic and its aftermath.

For this, all students, parents, and teachers in the South URC will be given online training in preparing digital portfolio, digital worksheet, and digital magazine.

South URC officials say while students and teachers have some idea how to shoot or click their creative works and upload them, parents rarely do. In a departure from the practice of involving only students and teachers, parents too will be roped in with the objective of realising digital literacy for all in society.

The project is at present being implemented from Class I to VII. From November 20, it will be extended to the higher secondary section.

A schedule too has been drawn up for Digi Showcase. For instance, to prepare digital worksheet portfolio for differently abled students, special educators will be trained first. Each educator will then prepare a portfolio for two students, and prepare worksheets as per class activities and hand them over to students.

165,2020/10/10,Vayalar award for Ezhacheri Ramachandran,"His collection of poems Oru Virginian Veyilkaalam wins the 44th edition of award

Poet Ezhacheri Ramachandran has won this year’s Vayalar Ramavarma Memorial Literary Award for his collection of poems Oru Virginian Veyilkaalam.

The jury was unanimous in selecting the winner for the 44th edition of the award, writer Perumbadavam Sreedharan, who heads the Vayalar Ramavarma Memorial Trust which has instituted the prize, told a press conference here on Saturday.

The award, which commemorates the celebrated poet and lyricist, comprises a purse of ₹1 lakh and a statuette designed by sculptor Kanayi Kunhiraman. The panel of judges consisted of K.P. Mohanan, secretary, Kerala Sahitya Akademi, N. Mukundan, and Ambalappuzha Gopakumar.

Reflecting angst

Mr. Mohanan said the jury was pleased to select a poet who was in harmony with the poetic tradition of Vayalar Ramavarma in themes, ideological stance, and use of language. Several poems in Oru Virginian Veyilkaalam dealt with the angst of people, like the Rohingyas, who did not have a land to call their own, he said.

In treading his own poetic path, Mr. Ramachandran possessed a clear concept of what and how Malayalam poetry should be in a global context, Mr. Gopakumar said. Mr. Mukundan said Mr. Ramachandran, in his poetry, attempted to portray the rigours, brutality, and the compassion of contemporary life through his own perspective.

166,2020/10/10,3.68 ha encroached land to be acquired in Munnar,"Title deeds of three plots that include an adventure resort found forged

Devikulam Subcollector S. Prem Krishnan has issued an order to acquire the land owned by Vellukunnel Jimmy Zakaria at Anayirangal near Munnar. Around 3.68 hectares of land, including the Calypso Adventure Resort and a camp, in Chinnakanal village was found to be encroached upon by creating fake documents in the wrong ‘thandaper.’

Earlier, a team under the Subcollector had been asked to identify land encroachers in Munnar and prepare their list for follow-up action. Mr. Zakaria was found to be a major encroacher.

Title deeds to be cancelled

The Subcollector’s report has ordered cancellation of title deeds of three plots of land encroached by Mr. Zakaria. The report said that some officials had connived with him to make fake documents and title deeds in the wrong ‘thandaper.’

The Revenue team found that the original title deed of the 3.68 hectares was issued to another land situated nearly half a kilometre away, proving that the title deed was forged. The Udumbanchola tahsildar (LA) has been asked to remove the camp and acquire the land immediately.

The report further stated that the Revenue Department had called many hearings, seeking land documents for verification. However, the landowner failed to submit the original records. The tahsildar found that the ‘thandaper’ number (3542) of three plots out of the four owned by Mr. Zakaria was forged.

Surveyor’s action

The report also recommended action against a former taluk surveyor M.S. Anoop. When the tahsildar had sought a sketch of the controversial land, the surveyor attached a survey report excluding the resort and camp from the sketch. The action was aimed at helping the land owner cover up the encroachment, said the report.

The plots encroached upon by Mr. Zakaria are in areas that have high commercial value.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/368-ha-encroached-land-to-be-acquired-in-munnar/article32821624.ece
167,2020/10/10,Chennithala seeks action against police officers for shoddy probe,"Visits parents of the Walayar girls at their agitation venue

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Saturday demanded stringent action against the police officers responsible for the shoddy investigation into the death of two Dalit sisters, both minors, at Walayar in Palakkad district in 2017.

In a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Mr. Chennithala said the law enforcement had come under withering criticism from across the political spectrum after a special court for the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) acquitted three persons accused of having sexually exploited the children and abetted their suicide.

The court had cited failure on the part of the prosecution and want of evidence as grounds for the acquittal. The wilful indifference on the part of the police to the plight of the indigent Dalit family had driven the parents of the girls to the street to seek justice for their wards, Mr. Chennithala said.

The parents were on an indefinite protest in front of the Secretariat. Mr. Chennithala visited them and expressed solidarity with their struggle.

The CPI had criticised the police for their “lack of empathy.” Janayugam, the party run newspaper, had penned a scathing editorial damning the police failure to bring the abusers to book.

The Bharathiya Janata Party (BJP) had championed the cause of the Dalit family. BJP activists had staged a march to the district police headquarters in Palakkad. BJP State president K. Surendran had alleged that the police had developed cold feet in the case because the main accused were local apparatchiks of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)].

The parents had also made a similar allegation. They had even doubted whether the girls, who were 10 and 12 at the time of their unnatural death, could have committed suicide. They had said they suspected that the accused could have murdered the children to evade prosecution.

Mr. Chennithala said the lawyer who defended the accused in the case was also a local CPI(M) man who officiated as the chairperson of the District Child Welfare Committee. He said it pointed to collusion and potential conflict of interest.

The UDF and the BJP demanded a CBI inquiry into the case. Director-General of Prosecution Manjeri Sreedharan Nair has reportedly given a similar opinion after he found flaws on the part of the prosecution.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/chennithala-seeks-action-against-police-officers-for-shoddy-probe/article32821421.ece
168,2020/10/10,CM to launch reconstruction work of the AC road,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will launch the reconstruction work of the Alappuzha-Changanassery (AC) road on Monday.

The 24.14-km road will be reconstructed as a semi-elevated highway at a cost of ₹671.66 crore. The project, which is expected to prevent flooding of the road during the monsoon season, will be completed in three years.

As part of the project, 2.9 km of the road will be refurbished using the bituminous macadam bituminous concrete (BMBC) method. As much as 8.27 km will be strengthened by laying geotextiles. Another 9 km of the road will be reconstructed with geogrid and geotextiles-encased stone column.

Five flyovers will be constructed at places prone to severe flooding. The flyovers will come up between the Onnamkara bridge and Mankombu Junction (370 m), Mankombu Junction and Mankombu culvert (440 m), Jyothi Junction and the Parasseril bridge (260m), Ponga culvert and Pandarakulam (485 m), and near Mankombu Thekkekara (240m).

Besides, three existing bridges at Kidangara, Nedumudi and Pallathuruthy will be widened. The Muttar bridge across the AC canal will be reconstructed. Apart from these, construction of nine causeways, 13 minor bridges, drains, ducts, retaining walls, culverts, bus shelters, and road safety features are also planned.

The two-lane road and flyovers with footpaths will have a width between 13 and 14 metres. The work will be carried out by the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society.

Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran will preside over the inaugural function to be held at Kaithavana Junction at 11.30 a.m. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac, A.M.

169,2020/10/10,Land allotted to resettle Pettimudy victims,"Eight families will get five cents each at Kuttiyar Valley

The government has issued a special order allotting land at Kuttiyar Valley for rehabilitation of the Pettimudy landslip victims. District Collector H. Dinesan had earlier requested the government for a special sanction and a Cabinet meeting took a decision in this regard, according to a senior official of the Revenue Department.

A report submitted by Munnar special tahsildar Binu Joseph had found that eight families were eligible for rehabilitation. They will be handed over title deeds. Fifty cents have been earmarked for the rehabilitation scheme.

Houses by KDPH

As per the order, each family will get five cents. The houses will be constructed by the Kanan Devan Hills Plantation (KDHP) company.

The district administration will provide an ownership certificate of the land to the eligible within a week. The KDHP will begin the construction works soon, said Devikulam subcollector S. Prem Krishnan.

Compensation

The compensation amount to the victims would also be distributed soon, he said. The Devikulam tahsildar had completed the verification process to provide compensation to the victims’ relatives. The tahsildar would submit a report to the District Collector, he said.

The landslip which occurred on August 6 claimed 70 lives. Four estate lanes under the KDHP were buried under the debris. A one-month-long search operation recovered 66 bodies. Four are still missing.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/land-allotted-to-resettle-pettimudy-victims/article32821311.ece
170,2020/10/10,Saudi returnees stake claim to severance pay,"Saudi law has clear norms for the package, but those who lost jobs during pandemic are yet to benefit

Jayadev (name changed) had 25 years of experience behind him when the construction company he was working for in Saudi Arabia laid him off following the COVID-19 pandemic. Though it was an unexpected blow, he had hoped that the end-of-service benefits, as per the Saudi labour laws, would be a substantial amount, enabling him to rebuild life back home.

But now, months after returning to his home in Kerala, there is no sign of the severance pay coming in. He, along with many others, is knocking on all doors to get the money owed to them for their long years of service.

Lawyers Beyond Borders

The issue of repatriated workers not getting benefits came to light when Lawyers Beyond Borders (LBB), an international network of legal experts working for the rights of migrant workers, filed a writ petition in the Kerala High Court earlier this year. Several workers who had lost their jobs and did not get severance pay began contacting the LBB.

Among the complaints, quite a few were from the employees of Nasser S. Al-Hajri Corporation (NSH). A total of 286 workers from here sent in complaints, out of which 188 were from Kerala, 39 from Bihar, 38 from Tamil Nadu, 17 from Uttar Pradesh, and four from Odisha.

“I have been working there for 14 years. On the day before our return flight, they said we would have to sign in several forms if we wanted our passport and ticket. They told us that the entire severance pay would be credited to us. Nothing has reached us yet. I was hoping to clear my debts with this money. I have filed a complaint with the non-resident Keralites’ cell,” says Rajan (name changed), an employee.

What the law states

According to the Article 84 of the Saudi Labour Law, “upon the end of the work relation, the employer shall pay the worker an end-of-service award of a half-month wage for each of the first five years and a one-month wage for each of the following years.” A worker is entitled to the package upon completion of a year’s service.

Some employees have filed police complaints in their districts. LBB India has already submitted memorandums to the Chief Ministers of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh requesting their immediate intervention. It has also submitted a request to the Union Minister of External Affairs to take action on the issue.

Way to proceed

“The Indian missions abroad maintain a panel of lawyers to provide legal assistance in such cases. Workers who have exited the country without registering a labour case can give Power of Attorney to the mission to pursue their case. The Saudi law stipulates that the labour claims have to be made within one year of end of service,” says K.R.

171,2020/10/10,State first to go digital in public education,"CM to officially declare this tomorrow

Thiruvananthapuram

Kerala has become the first State to have high-tech classrooms in all its public schools.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will declare the State first in the public education sector to become completely digital at 11 a.m. on Monday.

The Chief Minister will also announce through video conference the completion of high-tech school and high-tech lab projects.

These were implemented in the State as part of the Public Education Rejuvenation Mission. Over 3.74 lakh digital equipments were distributed in 16,027 schools for the smart classroom project.

In the first phase, 45,000 high-tech classrooms for classes 8 to 12 were readied in 4,752 government and aided high schools and higher secondary schools. The initiative was launched on January 21, 2018.

High-tech labs were started in 11,275 primary and upper primary schools for classes 1 to 7. The programme was kicked on July 5 last year.

The high-tech classroom project is being implemented by Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) with financial assistance from Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KIIFB). MP and MLA funds besides that of local self-government institutions were also utilised for set up the classrooms, expected to be a significant milestone in the area of education, a statement here said.

Thomas Isaac will deliver the keynote address.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-first-to-go-digital-in-public-education/article32821124.ece
172,2020/10/10,₹90-lakh cash seizure kicks up political storm,"Presence of Congress MLA becomes talking point.

Following the alleged seizure of ₹90 lakh in cash from a Kochi-based businessman at Anjumana, near Edapally, Thursday night, the Income Tax investigation department is trying to ascertain the source of the sum.

The case, however, attained political dimensions with questions being raised about the role of P.T. Thomas, MLA, in the reported property deal involving the businessman who deals in used bottles.

The legislator, on Friday, told the media that he had only tried to mediate a land deal involving the family of a late Communist activist, Dineshan, an accused in the Edapally police station attack of 1950.

According to an IT sleuth, the businessman intended to procure about three cents of land near Anjumana in the possession of a family for several decades. “When we finally finished counting the money seized, it was ₹90 lakh and it’s only natural that we try to find out the source of such a large sum. It could not be immediately ascertained and the businessman is indisposed,” said the officer. When the IT sleuths reached the spot, the legislator was leaving.

Denies charge

With jibes doing rounds on online platforms targeted at him, Mr. Thomas told the media that reports of him scooting the place seeing IT sleuths were baseless and libellous. “The family is close to me as the late Dineshan’s son was my driver from 2001 to 2006. I was present at the meeting in which the agreement between the family members and the businessman, was read out. The agreement condition was that money would be transferred to the family through bank,” he claimed.

Mr. Thomas contended that he had no idea whether the buyer was holding unaccounted money and it was left to the investigating agency to take necessary action. “The local CPI(M) leadership, ward councillor and representative of the residents’ association were also aware of the land deal,” he claimed and said he was contemplating legal action against those trying to malign his reputation by spreading false information.

The I-T Department, it’s learnt, would also discuss the developments with the Enforcement Directorate.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/maoder/article32818905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10TVPTTHOMAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/90-lakh-cash-seizure-kicks-up-political-storm/article32818906.ece

174,2020/10/10,Phase 1 of virology institute to go operational on October 15,"Clinical virology and viral diagnostics divisions.

The first phase of the Institute of Advanced Virology (IAV) will go operational on October 15, the State government said on Friday. Akhil C. Banerjee will soon take over as the director.

Established under the Kerala Biotechnology Commission, IAV is located at the Bio 360 Life Science Park, Thonnakkal, and is equipped with laboratories and diagnostic facilities for high-end research.

The divisions on clinical virology and viral diagnostics will be operational in the first phase.

Equipment ready

The two new divisions will function in a 25,000 sq ft pre-fab building. Various equipment and facilities required for disease diagnostics, including RT-PCR, gel documentation system, biosafety level cabinets, and nano photometer are ready at the facility, the government said.

In the initial stages, IAV will function under the Science and Technology Department, but it will be developed into an autonomous institution once it is fully operational. The governing council of the institute is headed by the Chief Minister. The government has so far created 18 posts for the institute. In all, eight scientific divisions on various aspects of virology research are envisaged at IAV. It will have research facilities for viral vaccines, anti-viral drug research, viral applications, viral epidemiology vector dynamics and public health, viral genomics, general virology, and bio-informatics and statistics.

175,2020/10/10,"Anakkampoyil-Meppadi tunnel proposal a gimmick, say greens","‘Project launched without conducting feasibility studies’

Environmental organisations in the district have alleged that the proposed Anakkampoyil-Meppadi tunnel road is a stunt by the ruling party foreseeing the forthcoming elections.

The Chief Minister launched the proposed project recently before conducting feasibility studies or ecological and social impact assessment, N. Badusha, president, Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana samiti, said.

Moreover, the government is yet to submit the project report before the Ministry of Forest and Environment for prior approval. Hence, such a move could be seen only as a gimmick, he alleged.

The Chief Minister had claimed that work on the multi-crore project, which is estimated to cost ₹858 crore, would be completed in three years. However, the construction of the 9.02-km-long Atal Tunnel at Rohtang in Himachal Pradesh had been completed in a span of 10 years by the Border Roads Organisation, while work on the 900-metre Kuthiran tunnel is yet to be completed even after six-and-a-half years, Mr. Badusha said.

The camel hump mountain complex, including the Chembra and Vellarimala peaks, is a highly ecologically fragile area on the Western Ghats, and the proposed tunnel will passed under the peaks. The Chaliyar river also originates from the peaks. The eastern slopes of the region are a landslip-prone, and landslip sites such as Puthulama and Mudakkai near Meppadi are on the hill slopes. The region has also been getting more rainfall compared to other parts of Wayanad.

A recent study by the Geological Survey of India after floods in the district last year proposed that anthropological intervention be restricted in the area. The Kasturirangan and Madhav Gadgil commissions had also suggested the need to conserve the region, Mr. Badusha said.

The government should execute projects to strengthen roads in the five ghat sections, instead of spending money for tunnel construction, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/37nr77/article32817374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08tvwycamelhumpmountaincomplex,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/anakkampoyil-meppadi-tunnel-proposal-a-gimmick-say-greens/article32817375.ece
176,2020/10/10,Reach I of NH bypass complete,"Work on foot overbridges, service road yet to be over though opening is on October 13.

The commissioning of the 26.7-km Reach I of the Kazhakuttam-Mukkola corridor of the 43-km National Highway 66 Bypass from Kazhakuttam to Karode on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border is taking place four decades after it was conceived.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) that executed the four-laning on Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) mode, overcoming several hurdles, including opposition from the local people, saw the cost going up from ₹778.41 crore sanctioned for the construction and ancillary works in 2015 to ₹1,120.86 crore in 2020.

The 24-month EPC contract given to the Hyderabad-based KNR Constructions Ltd. (KNRCL) for Reach I was over in November 2017.

In 1974

The 43-km bypass is part of the 212-km NH 66 bypass project of the NHAI from Thuravur, the work on which started in 1974. The 22-km first phase from Kazhakuttam to Kovalam was made two-lane 20 years ago. Land for a four-lane carriageway was acquired up to Kovalam Junction when the bypass was conceived.

But, the lanes on either side of the bypass have been encroached upon at many places. Removal of illegal buildings, felling of trees, shifting of utilities, demand for underpasses, and opposition from the local people were the challenges faced by the NHAI.

The construction of the 1.6-km four-lane flyover in front of Thiruvananthapuram airport’s international terminal at a cost of ₹142 crore for hassle-free connectivity to the airport after the EPC contract was awarded dragged the work on the 3.5-km Chakka-Eenchakkal-Muttathara stretch.

A two-lane bridge parallel to the existing one at Akkulam and the rail overbridge at Chakka across the Thiruvananthapuram-Kollam railway line were part of the bypass project.

When the Reach I is being commissioned on October 13, the foot overbridges at Guru Nagar after Infosys and Vazhamuttom are yet to be installed and a service road at Guru Nagar is yet to be completed owing to opposition.

Besides de-congesting the city that still lacks a mass rapid transit system, the Reach I of the NH 66 Bypass has further boosted the prospects of Technopark, the Thiruvananthapuram international airport, Veli and Akkulam tourism villages, Kovalam-Poovar tourism corridor, and the forthcoming Vizhinjam International Deepwater Multipurpose seaport.

The toll plaza of Reach I is to be set up by the NHAI between Thiruvallam and Vazhamuttam,1.2 km from Thiruvallam Junction. “The works have commenced and a temporary toll booth will be set up till the permanent toll plaza is ready,” a senior NHAI official told The Hindu.

Around 85% of the work on the 16.3-km Reach II from Mukkola to Karode had been completed. “The stretch is the first using pavement-quality concrete in the State. The aim is to commission it in March 2021,” he added.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/9nofn5/article32817182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20201009-WA0154,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/reach-i-of-nh-bypass-complete/article32817183.ece
177,2020/10/10,Call to empower farmer producer organisations,"‘Ensure availability of quality seedlings through decentralised coconut nurseries’

Farmer producer organisations should be strengthened in the coconut sector to enhance the availability of quality seedlings through decentralised coconut nurseries, according to representatives of coconut producer federations.

Chandran Thiruvalath, president, Kunnamangalam Coconut Producer Federation; Rajan Master, president, Changaroth Coconut Producer Federation, and Thomas Mathunni, president, Bhranikkavu Coconut Producer Federation, raised the demand after receiving awards for the best performing decentralised coconut nurseries managed by farmer producer organisations. The Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI) organised the function through videoconferencing.

CPCRI Director Anitha Karun presented the awards comprising a cash prize of ₹30,000, ₹20,000, and ₹10,000.

The awardees said that strengthening farmer producer organisations would immensely help coconut growers who were being exploited by various agencies. A lot of nurseries are cheating farmers by supplying inferior quality seedlings at exorbitant prices, they added.

They also shared their experiences of managing decentralised coconut nurseries and gave suggestions for sustaining such activities with the support of the Department of Agriculture.

In her inaugural address, Dr. Anitha endorsed the viewpoint that community nurseries managed by coconut farmer producer organisations was a prudent strategy to enhance the availability of quality seedlings.

178,2020/10/10,Silent warriors ease pain in the time of pandemic,"Today is World Palliative Care Day.

Delhi-resident Sarada, a 56-year-old former nurse from Kerala, suffering from advanced breast cancer, had lived with severe pain for over two months when lockdown prevented her from accessing any cancer care.

Like thousands of cancer patients, whose care and disease outcomes were affected by the pandemic, Ms. Sarada too found herself in much distress.

“I thought I could come to my home State and seek care but I was in so much pain, I did not know how I could manage alone. If it were not for Dr. Rajagopal, I may not be alive today to tell this tale,” she says.

From July on, right from her quarantine at the Medical College Hospital and later treatment at the RCC, she was taken care of by the team at Pallium India

“Apart from the ravages of COVID, the suffering that many have gone through during the pandemic because of chronic diseases, loss of income and loved ones is horrendous. Palliative care workers have been at the forefront, doing a lot of silent work,” says M. R.Rajagopal, chairman of Pallium India.

The 73rd World Health Assembly, which approved the resolution on COVID-19 response had sought the commitment of governments “to deliver palliative care services alongside safe testing and treatment for COVID”. Yet, palliative care is yet to be integrated with the formal strategy to fight the pandemic at the Centre or State-level.

For administrators, who are focussing on equipping their health systems to grapple with the care of thousands of patients overwhelming hospitals, the need and importance of palliative care may not be very tangible.

But from helping COVID-19 patients manage their lingering physical symptoms to helping the families of COVID patients fight the frightening feeling of stigma and isolation, palliative care workers have been working hard.

“Our helpline (8606 8848 89) was flooded with calls from patients seeking help to get their regular medications and people calling just to air their feeling of grief and loneliness,” says Vyshnavi, who coordinates the helpline at Pallium India

“This pandemic has not just taken many lives. Many could not say goodbye to their loved ones before they were whisked away into ICUs or give that final hug before parting. Even the funerals were lonely affairs. These people need help to cope with their daily lives while they are grieving,” Dr. Rajagopal points out.

It is for them that Pallium India is launching a new helpline, Sukh-Dukh, wherein trained professionals will offer counselling to help people cope with their loss.

The service is being piloted from Thursday, World Palliative Care Day.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/xmtswx/article32816944.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tv-Sukhcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/silent-warriors-ease-pain-in-the-time-of-pandemic/article32816907.ece

Bold and beautiful Kani Kusruti bagged the BRICS best actress award for her sterling role in Sajin Babu’s Biriyaani at the fifth BRICS festival, which was held along with the 42nd Moscow International Film Festival (MIFF) that was held from October 1 to 8 this year. This is the first time that a Malayalam film is getting an award at the festival.

“I dedicate this award to PK Rosy, the first heroine of Malayalam cinema and also the first Dalit actress in Indian cinema….I see a lot of amazing actors not being offered characters they could have been amazing at, just because of gaps in the current talent-representation infrastructure. I share this award with all of them and hope that together we will create a new culture of motion picture excellence that will provide equal opportunities to all actors, irrespective of their caste, class or skin colour,” states Kani.

Biriyaani maps the journey of Khadeeja, essayed by Kani, as she tries to negotiate her way to make ends meet in a patriarchal and conservative social set-up. The movie, shown from a woman’s perspective, explores how and why Khadeeja rebels against social and religious norms.

The film was the inaugural movie at the Asiatica festival in Rome, this year and it won the Netpac award for the best film.

Earlier this year, Kani had won the award for second best actress at the Imagine India Film Festival at Madrid and was also nominated for the best actor award at the TruBeCa Festival in New York for her act in Prashant Nair’s Tryst with Destiny.

In an earlier interview to MetroPlus, Sajin had said that he could only think of Kani in the role of Khadeeja even while writing the script of the hard-hitting film. He had said that Kani had “understood the character so well that there was no need to tell her anything more about Khadeeja”. He adds that he could only think of Kani while writing the script.

Due to restrictions imposed by the pandemic, Kani was unable to travel and accept her awards in person. However, Kani says with a laugh that, in a way, she is happy as she does not enjoy travelling. “I enjoy being at home, surrounded by greenery on all sides,” she says on a phone call from Goa.

Filmmakers crossing borders to make movies in another language is not unheard of. Except, it has taken Nissar, the Malayalam filmmaker with 25 movies to his credit, more than 25 years to try his hand in Tamil cinema. He only offers a smile in return when quizzed about this rather late entry.

Nissar’s 26th film, his first in Tamil, is titled Colours, and stars Varalaxmi Sarathkumar, Ineya, Divya Pillai, Ramkumar, ‘Mottai’ Rajendran and Bala Saravanan among others.

Filming for Colours was completed in March, just before lockdown, and having finished the post-production work after lockdown restrictions were relaxed by the Government of Tamil Nadu, the film is now ready for release. “It will soon be sent to the Censor Board for certification,” says Nissar.

Produced by UAE-based Aji Idicula for Limelight Pictures, Colours’ story, screenplay and dialogues were penned by Prasad Parapuram, a Crime Branch police officer attached to Aluva circle in Kochi, Kerala.

“Prasad had also written the story for two of my previous films, Two Days and Laughing Apartment Near Girinagar. Piraichoodan did the Tamil translation,” Nissar adds.

A “clean, family drama”, the filmmaker says Colours follows the stories of three female leads: Varalaxmi (who plays a gym trainer and a martial artiste), Ineya (who plays an NRI woman) and Divya Pillai (who plays a housewife).

“Ramkumar, who is [actor] Sarathkumar’s nephew, makes his debut in the film,” says Nissar, adding, “Each character’s life has its own colourful story arc, which is why we named the film such.”

The film’s producer, Aji Idicula, connecting over phone, for whom it is also the first time venturing into featuring film production, says that he had wanted to commit to a Hindi film. “But we found this subject very interesting. Our discussions made it clear that the subject would work well with the Tamil audience,” he says.

However, unlike most producers in Tamil cinema at the moment, Aji is hopeful of his film obtaining a theatrical release, should cinema halls be allowed to open towards the end of October in Tamil Nadu.

“In the event of reduced occupancy, we believe that it is possible to extend the number of days our film will be allowed to run in theatres,” says Aji, adding that the fact remains there is a “content lag” of about one year’s time in the market, a situation that he believes will work favourably for small and medium budget producers.

“In case there is no clarity on when theatres will open, then we can always explore OTT platforms.”

On opting to cast a debutant hero, Aji remarks that his production company had faith in the abilities of the director to extract the newcomer’s potential. “It is only when the director is unwilling to do that does such a gamble result in a loss. Nissar has spent many years as a filmmaker and he has a track record of working with newcomers and delivering the best output,” he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7m3oxr/article32820154.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Nissar,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/after-directing-25-movies-malayalam-filmmaker-nissar-set-to-make-tamil-debut-with-varalaxmis-film/article32820156.ece

You know what to expect from Adam Sandler and he delivers in this fitfully funny Halloween offering. Yes, the year began with the rather un-Sandler like Uncut Gems, but that is another story. In Hubie Halloween, Sandler as Hubie does all the comic Sandler things from weird accent to running gags and scatological humour.

It is Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts, and the town is getting ready for spooky fun. Hubie, who lives with his mum, is a community volunteer ensuring that everyone has a safe holiday. So, he pedals away furiously with a sash proclaiming volunteer and his Swiss-knife type thermos (it is everything from fire extinguisher to torch, but not a compass) to see that is all is well with tricks and treats.

Of course, there is a patient who has escaped from an asylum nearby, Hubie’s new neighbour is kind of weird, and then all the people that were mean to Hubie (which is practically everyone in town) start vanishing. Everything however comes right very sweetly in the end.

Hubie Halloween Run time: 102 minutes

Director: Steven Brill

Starring: Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Julie Bowen, Ray Liotta, Rob Schneider, June Squibb, Kenan Thompson, Shaquille O’Neal, Steve Buscemi, Maya Rudolph

Storyline: Hubie is a timid, well-meaning volunteer protecting his town from Halloween madness

Hubie Halloween is peppered with Happy Madison regulars such as Kevin James as policeman Steve Downey who cried for half an hour in his car when he was insulted, Julie Bowen as Violet, who Hubie loved since second grade, Steve Buscemi as creepy neighbour Walter Lambert, Rob Schneider as Hubie’s schoolmate and asylum escapee Richie Hartman and Shaquille O’Neal as strange-voiced DJ Aurora.

New entrants include Ray Liotta as dumb wiseguy Landolfa, June Squibb as Hubie’s mum with an improper choice of T-shirts, Michael Chiklis as unholy preacher Father Dave, Noah Schnapp (Stranger Things’ Will Byers) as Violet’s son and Ben Stiller as Orderly Hal in the asylum.

Hubie Halloween is a pleasant enough way to spend time in front of the telly — definitely not worth risking life and limb to watch in a theatre.

182,2020/10/10,‘The Memory Police’ adaptation: Charlie Kaufman and Reed Morano on board,"Kaufman, who most recently directed Netflix movie ‘I’m Thinking of Ending Things’, will adapt the script from the book

Filmmakers Reed Morano and Charlie Kaufman are joining hands for the feature film adaptation of Yoko Ogawa novel “The Memory Police.”

The project, which hails from Amazon Studios, will be helmed by Morano, who is best known for directing Hulu’s Emmy-winning series “The Handmaid’s Tale”, reported Deadline.

Kaufman, who most recently directed Netflix movie “I’m Thinking of Ending Things”, will adapt the script from the book.

The Japanese novel was originally published in 1994. Its English translation was released in 2019 by Pantheon Books.

“On an unnamed island off an unnamed coast, things have begun to disappear — at first little things: ribbons and then roses. Soon, photographs. However, a rare few are able to remember all that no longer exists, but the Memory Police are determined to make sure that what has been erased, remains forgotten forever.

“When a young novelist realises her book editor is one of those able to still remember, she hides him in a room beneath her floorboards. As the world closes in around them, they struggle defiantly to hold onto the truth,” the official logline read.

Morano most recently made her feature directorial debut with Blake Lively-starrer “The Rhythm Section”. She is currently working on Amazon series “The Power“.

Kaufman has previously written critically-acclaimed movies such as “Being John Malkovich” (1999), “Adaptation” (2002), and “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” (2004), which earned him an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/5wlvx2/article32819831.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/memory,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/memory-police-adaptation-charlie-kaufman-and-reed-morano-on-board/article32819832.ece

184,2020/10/10,Kristen Stewart on playing Princess Diana: ‘It’s one of the saddest stories to exist ever’,"Titled ‘Spencer’, the movie will centre around the Princess of Wales’ decision to leave Prince Charles while holidaying with the British royals

Actor Kristen Stewart, who is set to play Princess Diana in filmmaker Pablo Larrain’s upcoming biopic, says the role is quite challenging and she is nervous about getting her accent right.

Titled “Spencer”, the movie will centre around the Princess of Wales’ decision to leave Prince Charles while holidaying with the British royals.

During an interview with InStyle magazine, Stewart, 30, opened up about her prep work for the project.

“The accent is intimidating as hell because people know that voice, and it’s so, so distinct and particular. I’m working on it now and already have my dialect coach. In terms of research, I’ve gotten through two and a half biographies, and I’m finishing all the material before I actually go make the movie,” the actor said.

“It’s one of the saddest stories to exist ever, and I don’t want to just play Diana — I want to know her implicitly. I haven’t been this excited about playing a part, by the way, in so long,” she added.

Stewart believes that Princess Diana had an “unbridled, open, and intimate exchange” with the people that made her stand apart from the rest of the royal family.

“I always thought this person was stolen from us and I always had a curiosity about her. Every day that I unfold this story the more emotionally invested I get,” she added.

Larrain, whose directorial credits include critically-acclaimed films such as “Jackie”, “Neruda” and “Ema”, will direct the movie from a script by Steven Knight of “Peaky Blinders” fame.

He will also produce the film with Juan de Dios, Jonas Dornbach, Janine Jackowski and Paul Webster.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/z31l4s/article32819751.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILM-CHARLIESANGELS-KRISTENSTEWART,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kristen-stewart-on-playing-princess-diana-its-one-of-the-saddest-stories-to-exist-ever/article32819752.ece

Zee Studios on Friday said that it is planning to release Ishaan Khatter and Ananya Pandey-starrer “Khaali Peeli” and Tamil feature “Ka Pae Ranasingam” in theatres.

The two films made their debut on the pay-per-view service Zee Plex on October 2. They were also released at a drive-in theatre in Gurgaon.

Also starring Jaideep Ahlawat, “Khaali Peeli” was originally scheduled for a theatrical release on June 12, but was put on hold after the cinema halls were shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Last week, the Centre gave its nod to reopen theatres from October 15 with stringent dos and don’ts. However, not all state governments will follow this immediately owing to the pandemic scenario in their respective regions.

Zee Studios said they are in active discussions with theatre owners to release the two movies.

“We welcome the central government notification for reopening the theatres. We are currently in talks with the cinema owners and would love to provide our movies ‘Khaali Peeli’ and ‘Ka Pae Ranasingam’, which have been received quite well by the audience on the PPV format. We are sure that given the opportunity our audiences will enjoy them in cinemas as well,” Shariq Patel, CEO, Zee Studios stated.

“Khaali Peeli”, directed by Maqbool Khan, is a young, edgy roller-coaster ride that kick-starts one night, when a boy meets a girl.

186,2020/10/10,"Stalin challenges TN Chief Minister to release white paper on investments, jobs","The DMK president termed the Chief Minister’s statement that the current government has made Tamil Nadu one of the top investment destinations in India, “mere eyewash” and strongly condemned it

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday challenged Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to release a white paper on the number of investments attracted and jobs created for youth under the AIADMK government.

“If the Chief Minister really has guts, let him release a white paper on the number of investments and jobs created. I also request him to release another white paper on procurements made for tackling COVID-19,” he said in a statement.

Mr. Stalin alleged that only when the white papers are released will the corruption by the present government come to light, and wondered when they would be released. He termed the Chief Minister’s statement that the current government has made Tamil Nadu one of the top investment destinations in India, “mere eyewash” and strongly condemned it.

The status of MOUs signed in the two Global Investors Meet is not known, Mr. Stalin said and pointed out that the number of COVID-19 cases in the State is increasing. The State’s debt has touched ₹4.56 lakh crore and reports point out that they have so far borrowed ₹50,000 crore this year, he said.In addition, the Tamil Nadu government has said it would go with option 1 on GST compensation which means they have agreed to borrow from the market and have surrendered State’s rights to the GST Council, Mr. Stalin said.

The State does not have data about death of healthcare workers, doctors and the break-up on district wise testing of COVID-19 is also not shared, he pointed out.

Mr. Stalin alleged that the Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues are flouting all physical distancing norms in the name of meetings including the one to announce the AIADMK’s CM candidate. He also said the Chief Minister does not have the guts to make public the report submitted by a high-level committee headed by former Reserve Bank of India Governor C. Rangarajan, to revive the State’s economy.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stalin-challenges-tn-chief-minister-to-release-white-paper-on-investments-jobs/article32820914.ece
187,2020/10/10,DMK flags issue of Law Universities flouting OBC reservation norms,"DMK Parliamentary Party leader T. R. Baalu has written to the Union Education Minister in this regard

DMK Parliamentary Party leader and treasurer, T. R. Baalu has written to Union Education Minister Dr. Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, flagging violations of the Other Backward Classes (OBC) reservation policy in admissions to the National Law Universities (NLUs) for the academic year 2020-21.

“There is zero reservation for OBC candidates in admission to Under Graduate as well as Post Graduate courses conducted by the NLUs,” he pointed out in the letter.

The Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admissions) Act, 2006 and UGC guidelines mandate that Universities implement 27% reservation for OBCs both in admissions and in recruitment. But in NLUs, this has been totally ignored despite instructions to the Vice Chancellors to comply with the guidelines, Mr. Baalu pointed out.

According to the letter, in NLU, Bengaluru, there are 120 seats in BA-LLB course, out of which 93 seats are in the General Category while 18 and 9 seats are reserved for SCs and STs respectively, but there is a total denial for OBC candidates. This is the case across various NLUs including in Tiruchirapalli, the letter said.

Mr. Baalu said that NLU, Delhi was providing only 22% reservation to OBCs instead of 27%. He also pointed out in June 2020, the chairman of National Commission for Backward Classes had directed the University Grants Commission to take stringent action against NLUs flouting mandatory reservation policies for students belonging to OBCs, while NCBC had issued directions in this regard.

Despite these directions, Vice Chancellors of NLUs have refused to comply with the OBC reservation norm, Mr. Baalu alleged, which has put OBC students to great disadvantage.

He sought the Minister’s intervention and urged him to direct the UGC and Vice Chancellors of the NLUs to implement 27% reservation for OBCs students for the All-India Seats as well as the State-prescribed domicile reservation for admission in this academic year 2020-21.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmk-flags-issue-of-law-universities-flouting-obc-reservation-norms/article32820636.ece
188,2020/10/10,Oldest customers honoured during World Postal Week celebrations in Vellore,"Postal department staff honoured four senior citizens who have savings accounts at the post office

On Saturday morning, 79-year-old R. Lakshmipathy was elated when postal department staff visited his house, and honoured him. He is the oldest savings account holder (based on the date of opening the account) in Vellore district.

This was done as part of World Postal Week celebrations in Vellore district, which has around 200 post offices. Apart from Mr. Lakshmipathy, the department staff also honoured three other senior citizens who have savings accounts at the post office. Mr. Lakshmipathy, who joined the Postal and Telegraph Department in 1963 as a repeater station assistant, retired in 2001 as sub-divisional engineer in BSNL.

“I opened the account in 1983 and I now have a pension and savings account. When I was working in Chennai, I had an account at the Triplicane post office too,” he said. He said that post office accounts were reliable. “My son also has an account at the post office. Being a Central government organisation, I preferred this. Besides, I knew many in the postal department then,” he recalled.

The postal staff gave him a money bag and books with postal emblems. “We also honoured 90-year-old V.S. Pandurangan who has been holding an account since 2003, 75-year-old R. Krishnaveni from Cholavaram village and another senior citizen, A. Jagannathan,” said Komal Kumar, Superintendent of Post Offices, Vellore region.

Mr. Kumar said that usually, the customers are honoured at the post office itself. “But this time we asked the staff to go to their respective houses. This will build a rapport, and also it is safer during the COVID-19 pandemic,” he noted.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cgu1uc/article32820192.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10OCTTH--Vellorejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/oldest-customers-honoured-during-world-postal-week-celebrations-in-vellore/article32820193.ece
189,2020/10/10,Tamil Nadu defends Mullaperiyar dam panel,"State tells Supreme Court powers not passed on to sub-committee.

The Tamil Nadu government has rebutted allegations made in the Supreme Court that the Supervisory Committee for Mullaperiyar Dam “abdicated its duties” to evaluate the safety of the structure and water levels.

The State countered allegations that the Supervisory Committee constituted by the top court in 2014 has “delegated” its duties to a sub-committee.

The court had in September sought a reply from the State on a petition filed by Joe Joseph and office-bearers of the Kothamangalam block panchayat in Kerala expressing their apprehensions about the lack of proper supervision of water levels in the over-a-century-old dam located along the Periyar Tiger Reserve.

The State explained that the sub-committee is chaired by the Executive Engineer, Central Water Commission (CWC), with headquarters in Kochi. It has members from both Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The sub-committee periodically inspects the dam, collects data on seepage, collects water samples from the lake and seepage water, conducts water quality tests on them and so on and reports the details to the Supervisory Committee.

“The sub-committee members do not have any powers to give direction to the States. It is only doing the job of collecting information and data pertaining to the dam once in every two months, and if required, more frequently, as per directions of the Chairman of the Supervisory Committee, and furnishing the same to the committee,” the affidavit, filed through advocate M. Yokesh Kanna, said.

The sub-committee is only assisting the Supervisory Committee. This cannot be called the delegation of the authority of the Supervisory Committee, the affidavit argued.

The State said releases from the spillways of the dam are done in a systematic manner.

“Before operating the spillway gates during flood time, warning would be issued well in advance to the downstream authorities concerned of the State of Kerala before releasing water through the spillway. The answering Respondent (Tamil Nadu) ensures and takes care that no release is made without any warning, and sudden releases are not made through the spillway. The releases are made in steps so as not to cause any problem to the people who are living downstream of the dam,” the affidavit said.

It said all the aspects with regard to the dam safety and optimum utilisation of water to meet the drinking water needs and irrigation needs of five drought-prone districts of Tamil Nadu are being closely monitored.

“The Supervisory Committee duly assisted by the sub-committee are monitoring the system with reference to all safety aspects of the dam,” the affidavit said.

Tamil Nadu said it has been unable to collect rainfall data in the catchment area of the dam spread across 601 sq. km. on the tiger reserve in Idukki district of Kerala.

For forecasting the inflow from the catchment of the Mullaperiyar Dam, automatic rainfall stations coupled with telemetry system in the catchment area have to be installed. In that area, only one rain gauge station fitted with a weekly chart was available. Even in that, Tamil Nadu was not allowed to collect rainfall data and to change the rainfall chart in the equipment by the Forest Department of Kerala, since 2014.

In a Supervisory Committee meeting in 2015, Kerala had informed about its plans to install a rainfall forecasting system in six months to allow data flow to Tamil Nadu, Kerala and CWC.

“However, till date, such forecasting system has not been installed by State of Kerala,” the affidavit said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/cefwo6/article32764276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Oct03mduwaterGT47QPH035jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-govt-rebuts-allegations-against-mullaperiyar-dam-panel-in-supreme-court/article32819971.ece
190,2020/10/10,"Dalit panchayat chief in Cuddalore forced to sit on floor, secretary suspended","Police have also booked a case against panchayat vice-president under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act

A panchayat secretary in Cuddalore district has been suspended after it came to light that Rajeshwari Saravana Kumar, president of Therku Thittai Panchayat, belonging to the Scheduled Caste, was forced to sit on the floor during panchayat meetings.

The police have also booked a case against panchayat vice-president Mohan Raj, a caste Hindu, under Section 3 (1) (r) of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

Ms. Kumar, whose panchayat falls under the Mel Bhuvanagiri block, spoke about the harassment and discrimination she faced from caste Hindus, including Mr. Raj, after a photo of her sitting on the ground while other members were seated on chairs at a panchayat meeting went viral. The meeting was held in July.

Collector Chandra Sekhar Sakhamuri told The Hindu on Saturday that the matter was brought to the notice of the administration on Friday. The panchayat secretary has since been suspended in connection with the incident, he said.

Mr. Sakhamuri said that he would visit the Panchayat along with the Superintendent of Police M. Sree Abhinav for an enquiry.

The Therku Thittai panchayat has six ward members, including two belonging to the Adi-Dravidar community, while the others are caste Hindus.

Alleging that she has been a victim of caste discrimination ever since she was elected president in January, Ms. Kumar charged that Mr. Raj and three other ward members did not allow her to function independently.

“I was not allowed to hoist the national tricolour during the Republic Day in January. The panchayat vice-president said that his father would hoist the flag instead. He and three other ward members, all caste Hindus, insulted me and also forced me and another Dalit ward member Suganthi to sit on the floor during meetings while the rest sat on chairs”, she said.

Ms. Kumar alleged that she had not been allowed to occupy her seat at the panchayat office. This was the routine during the last three meetings and the reason they stated was that adequate chairs were not available, she said.

Ms. Kumar said that in the larger interest of serving the people, she had been bearing the continued insult and disrespect.

“The situation has now reached a level where continued silence would only strengthen their attitude and hence I have decided to speak out,” she said.

The panchayat meetings are convened only by the vice-president, who has been taking the stand that “I am a woman and know nothing and should remain quiet.”

She accused him of daring her to complain to any authority including the District Collector. “He said the officials would be least bothered”, she alleged.

When contacted, a senior official said that caste-based discrimination had been prevailing at the panchayat for some time. However, he dismissed the claims of the panchayat president that she was not allowed to hoist the national flag during Republic Day.

“The incident [being seated on the floor] happened a few months ago and the photo surfaced now and has gone viral. We have directed the Assistant Director, Panchayats to conduct an enquiry and lodged a complaint with the police to take action as per the provisions of the Scheduled Caste and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities Act)”, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2zw5i9/article32819498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dalit-leaderjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dalit-panchayat-chief-in-cuddalore-forced-to-sit-on-floor-secretary-suspended/article32819499.ece

192,2020/10/10,‘Strengthen vigilance wing in the judiciary’,"Prevailing system is insufficient: Justice S.M. Subramaniam

Justice S.M. Subramaniam of the Madras High Court (Madurai Bench) has called upon the judiciary to strengthen its vigilance wing to crush corrupt practices.

Building citizens’ confidence in the judiciary is the constitutional mandate, he said and added, “Doubts in the minds of the citizens will lead to destruction of the constitutional principles. Undoubtedly, the judiciary has to strengthen its vigilance wing and the prevailing vigilance system in the judiciary is insufficient to crush corrupt practices,” the judge said during the course of hearing in a case.

“Corruption is the devil in society,” he said referring to corrupt practices in the administration of government departments but added, “This court has to endorse the fact that the judiciary is also not exempt from corrupt practices.”

Justice Subramaniam observed that the conscience of the court would not permit if it fails to mention the increasing corrupt practices in the judiciary as well as on the court premises. Justice requires equal treatment of all the citizens and consistency in the justice delivery system.

Further, the judge pointed out that many former Chief Justices of India had lamented that the judiciary was not exempt from corrupt practices. Unfortunately, efficient measures were yet to be taken to deal with many kinds of corrupt practices in the judicial system, the judge strongly observed in his order.

With regard to corruption in government departments, the judge said it was painful to note that even for the implementation of beneficial schemes and government orders, corrupt practices were involved, in some cases involving higher officials. Awareness on the issue needs to be created, he added.

The Department of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption needs to be strengthened to a greater extent to ensure periodical surprise inspections and raids to deal with corrupt practices in public services, the judge said. He hoped that the observations would be taken in the right manner to develop an effective and efficient system.

The court was hearing a petition filed by N. Ulagaraj from Tirunelveli, an office assistant in the Registration Department. He challenged the punishment of compulsory retirement awarded to him on the charge of receiving bribe with regard to registration of sale deeds. The court said that the petition was devoid of merit and dismissed it.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/strengthen-vigilance-wing-in-the-judiciary/article32817601.ece

A robust ecosystem of research and innovation is crucial for India to sustain its large and vibrant economy and uplift its society, said K. Kasturirangan, former chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and former chairman of the National Education Policy Committee.

Mr. Kasturirangan was delivering, virtually, the convocation address at the Vellore Institute of Technology’s (VIT) 35th annual convocation on Friday.

The former ISRO chief said that students should aspire to deepen and broaden their knowledge, learn to experience the power of collective teamwork and be guided by higher values which they believe in.

With advancement in technologies such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality, an increasing number of hybrid jobs where a person’s vocational skills would complement the capabilities of hi-tech equipment could be foreseen, he said.

A higher education system was, therefore, necessary to prepare students for such jobs, he said, and added that vocational education would become an integral part of the larger vision of liberal education.

Noting that students from over 50 countries were studying at the institution, G. Viswanathan, chancellor of VIT, said the Kasturirangan Education Policy Committee spoke about internationalisation, as India needed to attract more students from abroad. Many students went abroad for medical education due to scarcity of seats, he said, adding that he hoped that the Prime Minister would increase the availability of medical seats in the country. VIT vice-presidents Sankar Viswanathan and Sekar Viswanathan and assistant vice-president Kadhambari S. Viswanathan were present.

194,2020/10/10,‘Suspend biometric authentication in PDS’,"Consumers fear COVID-19 spread

Activists and consumers have urged the government to suspend the use of biometric authentication at PDS shops. They fear that this could add to the rising number of COVID-19 cases.

Pattabiram resident K.T. Rajan said that in the shop where he buys essentials, no tokens were issued. “There were long queues on both days when we went to the shop because tokens were not issued. We usually buy the commodities for my son’s family... Now with biometric authentication, he has to come to the shop leaving his work,” he said.

T. Rangarajan, a consumer, said the internet connection was slow at most shops and queues were common. “I am afraid I can contract the novel coronavirus infection if I visit the shop. The shopkeeper holds the hand of the consumer and presses it on the biometric reader,” he said.

V. Rama Rao of the People’s Awareness Association said the government’s aim of creating a permanent record for the caretaker or helper was absurd. “Even children shift to other cities and countries for work. Domestic workers and caretakers keep changing. Since it is linked to Aadhaar, what is the need for this biometric system?” he questioned.

Consumer activist T. Sadagopan said Kerala had suspended biometric authentication at fair price shops. “People are asked to try up to three to six fingers. And if it does not work, it takes up to 10 minutes. People crowd shops, they do not follow personal distancing norms. The system is good. But this is not the time to implement it,” he said.

Sources in the Civil Supplies Department said the initial glitches had been set right, and officials were monitoring the implementation of safety norms.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/suspend-biometric-authentication-in-pds/article32817580.ece
195,2020/10/10,HC wants CCTV cameras at checkposts,"It wants them to be placed at State and district borders to curb illegal mining

The Madras High Court on Friday directed the State government and District Collectors to make sure that Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras were installed in all check-posts at district and State borders to keep a watch on transport of illegally mined minerals.

Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and G. Jayachandran issued the direction on a public interest litigation petition filed by activist ‘Traffic’ K.R. Ramaswamy in 2014. He had sought a direction to the government to consider his representations and curb illegal mining across the State.

It was in this case that another Bench comprising then Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul (now a Supreme Court judge) and Justice M. Sathyanarayanan had on September 11, 2014 appointed IAS officer U. Sagayam as a Legal Commissioner to inspect granite quarries in Madurai district.

Subsequently, the case was listed before different benches and it was heard last on March 26, 2019. In the meantime, Mr. Sagayam filed his report with a slew of recommendations and the government reported to the court that most of those recommendations were acceptable to it.

When the matter was listed on Friday, the petitioner’s counsel T. Sundaravadanam insisted on a direction to install cameras in all check posts. Accepting his plea, the judges asked Advocate General Vijay Narayan to make sure that a compliance report was filed by November 9. Justice Sivagnanam told the A-G that in another case being heard by him and Justice C.V. Karthikeyan, they came to know that the State government had collected several crores of rupees in penalty from those who transported illegally mined minerals. “You don’t require any other proof for illegal mining in the State. Huge quantum of penalty collected is a clear indicator. You are stopping transportation but not illegal mining. Mineral resources of the entire State are mapped but if officials close their eyes, nothing can be done,” the judge said.

The senior judge wondered how illegal mining could take place at the first instance in the State when all District Collectors get the assistance of an Assistant Director of Mines and Geology, who keeps track of every small detail related to mines and minerals in the district.

Despite such effective mechanism, places with hills turn into craters in no time, the judge lamented. He said that recently, limestone, too, had been declared a minor mineral and brought under State rule,s thereby increasing the risk of illegal mining.

Limestone quarries

“At least, granite quarries are in the open and we could see their condition with naked eyes but these limestone quarries are usually situated close to the factories and they get cordoned off illegally. We cannot even see what is happening,” the judge told the A-G.

Hema Babu, Special Public Prosecutor for the Directorate of Enforcement (ED), told the court that the police had booked as many as 70 cases against illegal mining in Madurai district, and the ED had also initiated action under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Senior counsel P. Wilson, representing a granite firm, told the court that Mr. Sagayam’s report was exaggerated. He claimed that the officer had simply considered the length, breadth and height of quarries to arrive at a notional loss to the public exchequer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-wants-cctv-cameras-at-checkposts/article32817579.ece
196,2020/10/10,‘COVID-19 impact on mental health is under-realised’,"The stigma associated with the disease has had an impact on people and it lingers on, say experts

COVID-19 has affected people in more than one way. The lesser known and under-realised being its impact on mental health. More than the fear of contracting the infection, the stigma associated with the disease has had an impact on people, and lingers on.

As another World Mental Health Day is observed, psychiatrists look at the ways in which the stigma associated with COVID-19 has affected people — it has made people think twice before getting tested, turned them hesitant from disclosing their COVID-19 status and has deterred many from seeking medical help early for symptoms. There is also the fear of being quarantined/isolated, and homes being barricaded/boarded up.

Doctors pointed to instances in which frontline workers were told to vacate their rented homes, neighbours pulling away their children and washing the floor with turmeric water as a healthcare provider lived nearby. A regular office-goer feeling distressed as none of her colleagues contacted her after knowing she tested positive and the wife of a patient being ostracised by villagers — there are numerous such instances of stigma.

“Many persons diagnosed with COVID-19, quarantined, or admitted for treatment are feeling stigmatised. Many frontline workers have faced stigmatising experiences. Families have started to hide their COVID-19 status as they feel anxious to talk about it,” R. Thara, vice-chairman of Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF), said.

She added, “As a result, people go late for treatment if they have fever for two to three days. The help-seeking behaviour has been affected by the fear of the stigma... Many feel isolated, socially rejected, experience constant anxiety and mild depression.”

Some families have not announced the death of elderly persons due to COVID-19, she said, adding: “The stigma is playing up and is making people a little scared. People should know that this is a viral infection and there is nothing to feel ashamed of and nothing to be afraid of.”

P. Poorna Chandrika, director of Institute of Mental Health, stressed the need to educate people. “The stigma... does have an impact on the mental well-being of people. It makes them susceptible to distress, anxiety and sleeplessness.” The stigma was more for healthcare workers.

R. Mangala, assistant director of SCARF, said that because of the stigma, some have started to think that it was shameful to be infected with COVID-19. This also depended on how an individual perceived the disease.“There is a lot more misinformation on COVID-19 than information... The number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalisation of persons should not get sensationalised in the media. The chatter around COVID-19 is scary. People are unwilling to get tested primarily because they fear that their houses would be boarded up. In such circumstances, public health becomes a disservice. It scares them at a time when they have to be tested in order to control the pandemic,” she said.

She said medical personnel started realising that they should address the mental health needs of those in quarantine and isolation facilities. “We should sensitise medical professionals to the need for having an open mind and look for mental health issues in patients in any situation,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/vgpxp8/article32448129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MentalHealth,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-impact-on-mental-health-is-under-realised/article32817561.ece
197,2020/10/10,Extension sought for Chief Secy.,"Shanmugam’s tenure is set to end on October 31

With the extended term of senior IAS officer and Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam set to end this month, the Tamil Nadu government has requested the Centre to extend his services for yet another term, and is awaiting a reply from Delhi in this regard.

Multiple sources told The Hindu that a file seeking another three months’ extension for Mr. Shanmugam had been sent to the Centre and its reply was being awaited.

“Even if not three months, the Chief Secretary would get an extension till December this year,” an officer said.

Since the Centre has accepted the requests of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat , it is most likely to accept the request of Tamil Nadu too.

As the election is only a few months away, if a new Chief Secretary assumes charge after January, it would take time for him/her to get a hold of things in the CS office, officials pointed out. Mr. Shanmugam, who was originally set to retire in July was given a three-month extension, considering the extraordinary situation in the State due to COVID-19.

The 1985-batch IAS officer assumed charge on June 30, 2019. He was set to retire in July this year initially. Following a request from the Tamil Nadu government, the Union Department of Personnel & Training had in June extended the services of the officer till October 31 this year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/extension-sought-for-chief-secy/article32817550.ece

201,2020/10/10,Salons demand justice for rape victim,"Protests held across State, demanding an appeal against acquittal of accused

Following the acquittal of the suspect in the rape and murder of a minor girl from Dindigul by the District Mahila Court last month, salons across the State downed their shutters on Friday, demanding justice for the girl’s family. Protests were also conducted across the State, demanding that the government appeal against the acquittal.

On April 16, 2019, the body of the girl was found at her house in Dindigul. Subsequently, a 17-year-old boy was arrested in connection with the case. However, a Mahila Court recently acquitted the suspect in the case. “We feel that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the case was not heard properly and was closed hastily. We want the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court to take up the case,” said V. Palani, State president, Tamil Nadu Maruthavar Samudhaya Peravai, who organised a protest in Chepauk on Friday and called for the shutting down of salons for a day.

More than 10 lakh salons were closed across Tamil Nadu. “We also want the government to provide ₹1 crore as compensation to the family. The girl was born to the couple 10 years after their marriage and her father is a hair stylist. The compensation announced now, which is just a few lakh rupees, will not suffice,” he added.

Meanwhile, in the southern districts, too, more than 10,000 salons remained shut on Friday. In Dindigul town and its periphery, more than 1,000 shops were closed. The All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIADWA) also asked the State government to appeal against the verdict.

In Salem, members of the Veeratyagi Vishwanatha Das Thozilalar Katchi protested in front of the District Collectorate, condemning the acquittal. The protesters demanded justice for the victim’s family. They said that the sole accused in the case had been acquitted and this was against natural justice. They demanded that the State government appeal against the acquittal.

Hairdressers in Krishnagiri, organised under the Veerathyagi Vishwanatha Das Thozhilalar Katchi, also staged a demonstration. They gathered opposite the Anna statue and demanded that the State government appeal against the verdict. The protesters demanded that the family be ensured justice for the brutal rape and murder. Similarly, in Dharmapuri, barbershops were closed in various parts of the district. In Paapireddypatty, all outlets were closed in solidarity with the family of the victim, who belonged to the same hairdressers community.

In Tiruchi, all shops attached to the Tiruchi District Barbers’ Association closed their shutters. Members organised a prayer for the victim, whose father was a barber in Dindigul. A petition was also submitted by the association to the Tiruchi District Collector demanding justice for the family. Several salons not attached to the association also shut shop on their own, the Barbers’ Association requested the cooperation of others.

Over 1,000 barber shops in Vellore were closed on Friday. “We submitted a petition to the Vellore Collector seeking justice for the family of the girl,” said M.

202,2020/10/10,‘Virtual courts can be made permanent’,"Robust infrastructure is in place at Madras HC, says judge

Justice T.S. Sivagnanam, chairman of the computer committee of the Madras High Court, on Friday said the institution was fully equipped to make virtual courts a permanent feature, even after the threat of COVID-19 subsides, as recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice.

He told committee member P. Wilson that robust infrastructure had already been put in place at the High Court with the guidance of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi. Concurring with the judge, he said the Madras High Court had emerged as a pioneer in the conduct of proceedings through video-conference.

The judge told Mr. Wilson that the High Court, with the assistance of the Tamil Nadu e-Governance Agency, had purchased 100 licences of Microsoft Teams software. Each judge had been given an individual licence for seamless conduct of proceedings. The rest of the licences were used by the Registry.

Till Monday, only 19 judges used to conduct virtual courts from their chambers in the High Court buildings. The rest were conducting the courts from their home offices.

However, from Monday, 33 judges had begun to conduct the courts from the High Court itself. All infrastructure required for it had been put in place.

While most judges preferred to conduct the virtual hearings from their chambers, some insisted on conducting the proceedings from the court halls. Arrangements had been made for that in the court halls too. Not just admission cases but also final hearings were being conducted through the virtual courts and the verdicts were being delivered as usual.

Individual licence

Similarly, all judicial officers in the State had also been given individual licence for the software and they were also conducting the court proceedings seamlessly, he said. The judge went on to state that even the Tamil Nadu Judicial Academy was taking virtual classes and seminars from its offices in Madurai, Chennai and Coimbatore.

Mr. Wilson said the Parliamentary committee had taken note of the great strides made by Madras High Court, adding that initially there was resistance to virtual hearings from lawyers “but now everyone wants virtual courts”.

“Yes, in fact, I was telling the Chief Justice that earlier we were trying to sell the concept of virtual courts to the lawyers but now we are doing the other way round,” Justice Sivagnanam remarked.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/virtual-courts-can-be-made-permanent/article32817529.ece

Governor Banwarilal Purohit, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and senior political leaders in the State condoled the death of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan.

In his condolence message released by the Raj Bhavan, the Governor said he was saddened by the demise of the Union Minister.

“The founder of the Lok Janshakti Party, he was a long-time parliamentarian and a visionary leader with political wisdom. He was known for his simplicity, humbleness, governance skills and commitment towards the deprived class. He was the voice of the oppressed and always stood for the marginalized throughout his life. His contribution in the upliftment of the downtrodden people will be remembered forever,” Mr. Purohit said.

‘Irreparable loss’

The untimely demise of the Union Minister was an irreparable loss to the people of India, his supporters and particularly to Bihar, the Governor noted.

“I convey my deep condolences to the bereaved members of the family and his followers. I pray to the Almighty God to rest his soul in peace and give strength to his family to overcome this unfathomable loss.”

Chief Minister Palaniswami said in a statement that the death of the Union Minister came as a shock to him. The Union Minister worked for the people and for social justice and for the downtrodden in Bihar. His death was a loss not only to his family, party workers but to the entire nation, the CM said.

204,2020/10/10,Murugan refuses to say if NDA will have Palaniswami as CM candidate,"State BJP leader calls on CM

BJP Tamil Nadu president L. Murugan on Friday said he welcomed the AIADMK’s announcement of Edappadi K. Palaniswami as its Chief Ministerial candidate, sidestepping questions twice during the day whether Mr. Palaniswami would the CM candidate of the NDA in Tamil Nadu.

Mr. Murugan met Mr. Palaniswami to thank him for the AIADMK’s support for the farm Acts and the State government’s swift action in the PM KISAN scheme scam.

“I also congratulated him for being nominated as the AIADMK’s CM candidate,” Mr. Murugan told reporters after the meeting. When reporters asked if Mr. Palaniswami was the CM candidate of the AIADMK or the NDA, Mr. Murugan replied, “That’s what I said very clearly now.” A senior office-bearer of the BJP said an appointment with Mr. Palaniswami had been sought several days back, well before the AIADMK tussle to decide the CM candidate happened.

Earlier in the day as well, when the State unit unveiled its “Vetrivel Yatra” programme, Mr. Murugan told reporters, “The AIADMK has announced their CM candidate [Mr. Palaniswami]. I welcome that.”

Vetrivel Yatra

The State BJP unit will hold a one-month “Vetrivel Yatra” across Tamil Nadu covering the Arupadai Veedu, seeking filing of cases against Karuppar Kootam members under the NSA and to give support to Hindus whose religious sentiments “are regularly demeaned by the DMK”. “There will be a big change in Tamil Nadu after the Vetrivel Yatra. The BJP’s MLA will be part of the State Assembly after the next elections. The party that we support will only form the next government with a thumping majority,” he said.

The party will take out the yatra meeting people across the State from November 6 to December 6. “The DMK has made it a habit of insulting Hindus’ sentiments, Tamil gods, and worshipping practices of Tamil people. We want Karuppar Kootam to be investigated and the DMK’s links with them to be exposed,” he said.

BJP TN vice-president K.S. Narendran, who explained about the yatra, said it will pave the way for “anti-Hindus and anti-national forces to be thrown out of Tamil Nadu”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/iiqz4s/article32817525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th10murugan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/murugan-refuses-to-say-if-nda-will-have-palaniswami-as-cm-candidate/article32817526.ece
205,2020/10/10,Sipcot to form industrial parks with pvt. landowners in JV mode,"Expression of Interest sought from those owning 100 acres of land

The State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu Limited (Sipcot) will soon be establishing industrial parks in a joint venture mode with private landowners across the State.

After holding several meetings, the request for application has finally been put up by Sipcot. “We have called for expression of interest from private landowners who own 100 acres and above for the formation of industrial parks through a joint venture mode with Sipcot,” said J. Kumaragurubaran, managing director.

“Our usual pattern of taking land is direct acquisition. And if it is a government land it will be done through a land transfer route. At times land acquisition takes a lot of time due to various processes involved. So we are trying this mode,” he said.

Another senior government official said that with more investors expressing interest to come to Tamil Nadu we need to expand our land bank. “With Chennai already crowded with too many manufacturing units, investors are now open to evaluating newer locations especially down south. Firms also want to look at places where they can commence operations immediately. There are so many land parcels lying idle across the State which can be utilised by Sipcot and land owners can also monetise on this,” he said.

Last year, Chief Minister, Edappadi K.Palaniswami mentioned in the Assembly that to enable all districts to become industrial hubs, Sipcot will be floating joint ventures with those who have over 100 acre of land parcel.

Govt. concession

The government has decided to extend the benefits that allottees of Sipcot industrial parks enjoy including 50% exemption on stamp duty and allow the concerned joint venture company to retain spaces set apart for roads, recreation purpose like parks and playgrounds. It will also be sharing its knowledge and expertise in development and operations of the joint venture industrial park, if required by the promoter. In case of requirement of government poramboke lands in the vicinity of the proposed project area to have contiguity, Sipcot shall alienate those lands, in its favour and lease out the same to the joint venture company by way of usual business transaction.

Established in the year 1971 to drive industrial growth in the State, Sipcot till date has nurtured 23 industrial parks/growth centres, including 7 special economic zones (SEZ), covering a total area of over 34,000 acres across 15 districts in Tamil Nadu.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/79ali2/article32817504.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10SIPCOT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sipcot-to-form-industrial-parks-with-pvt-landowners-in-jv-mode/article32817505.ece
206,2020/10/10,‘No curbs on movement of travellers’,"We are only issuing auto-generated e-passes, State tells HC

The Tamil Nadu government on Friday told the Madras High Court that it had not restricted the movement of people from other States and countries to Tamil Nadu, but was only insisting that they obtain an auto-generated e-pass for contact-tracing owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy were informed by State Government Pleader (SGP) V. Jayaprakash Narayanan that the government was only collecting the basic details of inbound travellers to keep a tab on their movement.

However, wondering whether it would be permissible for the State government to do so when the Centre had advised the States to discontinue the e-pass system, the judges directed the SGP to make sure that his submissions were put in writing by Monday.

The direction was issued at the hearing of a writ petition against the insistence on e-passes. Petitioner’s counsel Abishek Jebaraj told the judges that the Centre’s advisory was binding on the State. He pointed out that the guidelines issued by the Union Home Ministry on September 30 stated that there should be no restriction on inter-State or intra-State movement, and no separate permission or approval or permit would be required for such travel. But the State government was insisting that inbound travellers fill up forms online and obtain e-passes without which they would not be allowed to enter the State.

He recalled his personal experience while flying from Delhi to Chennai last month. “In the e-pass application, I had to fill the name of the cab driver and the registration number of the vehicle. Luckily, I was able to make a phone call to the driver and obtain those details. Otherwise, I would not have been allowed to step out of the airport,” he told the judges.

Counsel also wondered what was the purpose of the State government collecting such details from inbound passengers when the online e-pass application form does not even require the applicant to state whether or not he had tested positive for COVID-19.

After hearing him at length, the judges directed the SGP to make sure that a responsible government official filed an affidavit explaining under what authority the State was insisting upon such auto-generated e-passes despite the Centre’s advisory against them.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/no-curbs-on-movement-of-travellers/article32817419.ece
207,2020/10/10,SHGs venture into e-commerce,"Government programme facilitates better marketing of their products

P. Tamil Selvi, 47, from Kangeyanallore in Vellore district, and her six-member women’s self-help group (SHG) that makes wooden toys, are elated — for the first time, they have received an order for a wooden cow through an e-commerce site.

Ms. Selvi’s SHG has been part of the Tamil Nadu Urban Livelihood Mission (TNULM) for three years. Recently, TNULM officials called for a meeting between representatives of the e-commerce site and nine SHGs from Gudiyatham and Vellore that have been involved in making toys, glass paintings, lungi, wall-hangings and other gift articles.

The idea was to sell their products through the e-commerce sites. “Our families have been making wooden toys for generations. We make walkers for children, horse cradles and wooden animal figurines for children. Most of our customers have been from Vellore and its surrounding areas. Now, we hope to get more orders from other parts of the country,” said Ms. Selvi.

Business hit

Similarly, S. Hemavathi, 44, from Katpadi and her SHG members have got their glass paintings put up on the e-commerce site. “We make emboss paintings and fur toys too. We were trained under TNULM in 2019. We spoke to banks and colleges and started getting orders. But due to COVID-19, demand has been low,” she said.

M. Ramadasu, city livelihood centre manager, Vellore, said that earlier, the products used to be sold in exhibitions or to customers in Vellore and its surrounding areas.

“We wanted to help them market the products better. We hope to add more products in the coming days,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/18j59v/article32817319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THSHG1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/shgs-venture-into-e-commerce/article32817320.ece
208,2020/10/10,Tamil for archaeology course: CM thanks Modi,"After political parties in Tamil Nadu voiced concern, Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology has included a master’s degree in Tamil as a qualification for its two-year postgraduate diploma course in archaeology.

In his letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a copy of which was released to the media, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said: “I would like to express my heartfelt thanks for the immediate response to my request... I appreciate the prompt response and once again thank you for the immediate action in the matter.” Mr. Palaniswami had written to Mr. Modi on Thursday evening.

In a corrigendum to its admission notice issued on October 8, the Joint Director-General of Pt. Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archaeology has said the qualification norms have been altered, including Tamil this time. According to the corrigendum, anyone with a master’s degree in all classical languages notified by the Government of India — Tamil, Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam, Odia and Pali, Prakrit, Arabic or Persian — would qualify for the course.

Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan, who was the first to highlight the issue, has welcomed the decision. “Injustice that attempted to render Tamil students unqualified and deny them entry into the Archaeological Survey of India at its very doorsteps has been thwarted,” he said.

He recalled that several parties and organisations had condemned the notice that did not include a master’s degree in Tamil as qualification for the course.

Among the qualifications listed for the course were a master’s degree in Ancient or Medieval Indian History/Archaeology/Anthropology, Indian Classical languages such as Sanskirt, Pali, Prakriti, Arabic or Persion or in Geology with knowledge of Pleistocene age from a recognized university.

Subsequently, Chief Minister, Edappadi K. Palaniswami wrote to the Prime Minister on this issue, appealing him to include PG degree in Tamil also in the list of qualified courses.

“It was Tamil Nadu that had raised its voice against the injustice meted out to the classical languages other than Sanskrit,” the CPI(M) MP said.

Mr. Venkatesan also said the Centre should dissolve the expert committee constituted by the Ministry of Culture to conduct a study of the origin and evolution of Indian culture.

209,2020/10/10,50 % quota for women in elected body of GHMC,"Conversion of agricultural land use to be simplified

The Cabinet on Saturday approved 50% reservation for women in the elected body of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporations ahead of polls.

Effectively, 75 out of 150 divisions in GHMC will be reserved for women. A Bill amending the GHMC Act to the effect will be taken up by the Assembly on Tuesday.

By other decisions, the Cabinet also decided to amend laws to provide for changes in the functions of municipal ward committees and reservation of wards. The deadline for online uploading of information about landed properties has been extended by 10 days up to October 20.

The Cabinet meeting, presided by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, also discussed the character of integrated township in Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority limits.

It was decided at the meeting to simplify the conversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural use by amending the NALA law on non-agricultural lands. The amendment will be made to enable people make the necessary changes online through Dharani portal.

The move was an extension of the amendment to the revenue law of State government removing the discretionary powers of officers to regulate conversion of agricultural land for non-agricultural use. The human intervention was already removed in the Act passed in the last session of Assembly.

A release said the Cabinet discussed in detail the steps taken by government to see that the farmers did not face hardship on account of COVID. Just as agricultural produce was procured in villages instead of market yards in the kharif, the same system will be followed in rabi as the virus had not receded. As many as 6,000 centres will be opened in villages to procure produce from the last farmer. There was no need for farmers to panic but they must ensure that the moisture content in foodgrains did not exceed 17 %. The grains must be dust free.

The Cabinet expressed anguish at the inability of maize farmers to get minimum support price due to the decisions of the Centre. It was unfortunate that the decisions spelt danger to agriculture sector. The meeting also noted with despair the decision of Centre to import maize from other countries in spite of the availability of maize in quantities more than consumption levels.

The meeting appealed to maize farmers to take a guarded decision on cultivation of the crop keeping in view the glut in global market and the Centre’s decisions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/50-quota-for-women-in-ghmc/article32823568.ece
210,2020/10/10,CT scan at Osmania General Hospital out of order,"Rainwater entered the machine and it had to be switched off

The impending crisis with diagnostic machines has unfolded at Osmania General Hospital (OGH).

From Friday night, the hospital does not have a CT-Scan facility. The equipment is crucial since the scanning is important before performing surgeries on victims of road accidents with head injuries, for brain stroke patients to know if there is any internal bleeding or clots in the brain.

Besides, CT-Scan is used to know the probability of patients having COVID-19 if they show symptoms of the infectious disease.

After rain water made its way into diagnostic rooms in the hospital’s Quli Qutb Shah block on Friday night, the CT Scan and MRI machines were shut down.

“We get at least five to six such cases a day. We cannot rely on MRI machine alone as it takes around half an hour for one patient to be scanned. And road accident victims or paralysis patients need emergency care. So CT scan is preferred,” sources in the hospital said.

The hospital has two CT Scan machines. One in the Out Patient block, another in the Quli Qutb Shah block. The CT Scan in OP block is dysfunctional. So the hospital was left with only one of the machines.

However, after rains pounded Hyderabad on Friday evening, water entered into the CT Scan machine in the diagnosis room in Quli Qutb Shah block and it was switched off. The result, no CT scan machine at the major hospital on Saturday.

“Now we don’t have a CT Scan machine. If there is a patient in need of emergency care, we are forced to use X-Ray or Ultrasound machines. This situation could have been avoided if the machine in OP block was repaired on priority basis,” sources said.

OGH and Gandhi Hospital are tertiary care hospitals where road accidents and other emergency cases are attended. Since only COVID-19 patients are attended at Gandhi Hospital, OGH was the only government tertiary care centre in Telangana where emergency cases are attended. With the defunct machines, a crucial process before surgeries could not be executed.

It was learnt that the engineering team from Telangana State Medical Services and Infrastructure Development Corporation (TSMIDC) are taking remedial measures.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rrnemq/article32826104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10-OSMANIAGENERALHOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ct-scan-at-osmania-general-hospital-out-of-order/article32823396.ece
211,2020/10/10,Mallannasagar oustees are on tenterhooks,"Displaced by the reservoir project, they must rebuild their lives.

For the villagers displaced by the Mallannasagar reservoir project, generations of relationship with their land is set to come an to abrupt end, sooner or later.

Each of them has a story to tell, if anyone were ready to hear it. They will all have to restart their living from zero, literally.

G. Naveen Kumar is a resident of Singaram in Kondapaka mandal. His grandfather and great-grandfather were born in the same village, as was he. He does not know whether the generation before them was also born there.

The Mallannasagar project turned their lives upside down. Mr. Kumar’s extended family has given about 42 acres towards the construction of Mallannasagar. Mr. Kumar’s family has given about three acres as their share in the combined family land, and they were paid a total ₹18 lakh for it.

They also received some amount for a house. Spending all of this amount, they could only buy 150 yards of a residential plot at Siddipet, which cost them a total of ₹24 lakh.

“We are unable to buy any land outside the purview of Mallannasagar as rates had skyrocketed by the time we received compensation. It is beyond our wildest dreams to become landowners again. Hence, we have compromised with a plot,” Mr. Kumar told The Hindu.

Not only Mr. Kumar, others also know that their days with their villages are numbered.

On Friday, revenue and police officials had reached neighbouring Erravalli and asked villagers there to vacate, stating that they should shift to Mutrajpally near Gajwel, where a new rehabilitation and resettlement colony is coming up.

‘A few weeks’

Officials considered the oustees’ request with sympathy and agreed to allow them to stay in the village till Dasara, the most important festival in Telangana, was over.

“We will be the next target of the authorities to vacate our village. There is no other go but to vacate, maybe in another few weeks,” said Mr. Naveen.",,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/telangana-assembly-elections-2018/yt7jy5/article32823146.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11HYSINGARAMONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/mallannasagar-oustees-are-on-tenterhooks/article32823147.ece
212,2020/10/10,"Maize cultivation not viable in Rabi, say experts","Adverse conditions in the country for its cropping and storage, officials tell CM

A meeting, presided by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to discuss the viability of maize cultivation in Rabi came to a conclusion that it was impossible for farmers to fetch minimum support price from the crop in Telangana.

The situation warranted that only those farmers who were willing to earn however low income could face the risk of cultivating the crop, a release said after the meeting that was attended by Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, Chief Advisor to government Rajeev Sharma and others. Agricultural experts and officials informed Mr. Rao that it was not at all advisable for farmers to go for maize cultivation in the State in view of adverse conditions in the country for the crop and storage. The policies of Central government saw to it that the maize farmers were not assured of MSP.

The policies enabling people to sell and buy agricultural produce anywhere in the country and steep reduction of import duties on produce were the bane of poor farmers. A release said the buffer stock of maize in global market after meeting the consumption levels was 28 crore tonnes. India needed 2.42 lakh crore tonnes of maize for its consumption annually, but the available quantity was 3.53 lakh crore tonnes. In effect, the additional stock available was 1.11 lakh crores tonnes.

Another 4.10 lakh crore tonnes of maize produced in Kharif this year will arrive at market yards shortly. It was grown over 2.04 crore acres in the country. Therefore, the country was assured of maize not only for this year but next year, the officials explained Mr.Rao.

The situation turned worse with the decision of the Centre to import another five lakh tonnes of maize from other countries. The Centre reduced the import duty on maize from 50 to 35 per cent. On account of just 15 per cent import duty, the maize farmers were pushed to a situation as not to expect MSP.

The Agriculture Minister intervened to inform that the agriculture officials held meetings with poultry industry to ensure a reasonable price for maize farmers in these circumstances. However, the feed for chicken was available at very low prices in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Hence the poultry industry was not prepared to buy feed from farmers of Telangana.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/unh02s/article32823129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11MEYZE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/maize-cultivation-not-viable-in-rabi-say-experts/article32823130.ece
213,2020/10/10,Vadderigudem villagers seek relocation,"The village in Nalgonda district is ODF on paper

Men, women and children at Vadderigudem, a habitation under the Tirumalagiri gram panchayat of Pedda Adiserlapalli in Nalgonda, are an exceptional category. They have no toilets, effectively.

“Men squat on the roadside, women and girls go into the tall grass. It must be easier for men, since we have other issues. And there are swarms of mosquitoes always, sometimes snakes, in the grass. So we go together,” the huddled up women pour out.

Vadderigudem, named as its maximum habitants belong to Vaddera caste, has been a formal settlement for decades. Once an arid place, thanks to Hyderabad’s drinking water project, the Alimineti Madhava Reddy Project at Puttamgandi, Vadderigudem has high water table for nearly 20 years.

According to Orsu Venkamma, “Water is just two feet under, so leach pits or septic tanks are not possible. I don’t have an option, I am aged, overweight and have joint pains. But the place gets really dirty whenever I use the toilet,” she says.

But, how did the administration construct Individual Household Latrines (IHHL) under Swacch Bharat Mission?

“They said it was mandatory. They photographed the toilet pan and the door, and later released ₹12,000. We requested sarpanch and MLA who came for votes, and voted for them, but the actual problem was not solved,” another woman Yadamma said.

Women say there are about 150 of them, who work in self-help groups, who brought pressure on the panchayat and mandal leadership during elections, for toilets. One leader had promised to buy half-acre land on the far side of the grass, to build a septic tank, so that sewage pipeline could be drawn from each house and the waste sent there.

“We thought that would be a solution, but it did not work,” younger women, including newly-wed, a few nursing students and college-goers, said.

Latest reports available on the State and Centre’s SBM (G) websites confirm that 151 new toilets were built, of which 45 are in Vadderigudem, in Tirumalagiri. They were photographed in the three stages, two fund transfer orders of ₹6,000 each were realised, and a 100% IHHL coverage was achieved.

And subsequently, two years ago, Tirumalagiri, along with 560-plus villages in 31 mandals in Nalgonda was declared Open Defecation-Free.

For the aggrieved women of Vadderigudem now, they see only one remedy:

“The only reason to be in Vadderigudem is agriculture, but toilets are not possible. For the same reason, there are even no visitors or guests here. This village should be banned and we should be relocated. We wish to talk to CM KCR,” they say.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/34m7pl/article32822696.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07HYTOILET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/vadderigudem-villagers-seek-relocation/article32822699.ece
214,2020/10/10,Layout made on govt. acquired land,"MRO inspects site and clears the spot taking the help of police personnel

Tension prevailed for sometime at this village in Sangareddy mandal on Friday when officials cleared an illegal layout. The Revenue officials have to take heavy police protection to clear the layout. Villagers had a heated argument with the officials with some villagers even using abusing words against them.

About 13 acres of land in different survey numbers was acquired by the government about two decades ago for house sites. Even pattas were issued for about 316 beneficiaries by the officials then. Only 80 members have constructed houses, whereas the remaining land was vacant.

During the time of land acquisition, some farmers approached the court and the government deposited the money in the court and now the land belongs to government and the case pending in court. The land was purchased by the government by paying ₹35,000 per acre.

Feeling that justice was not meted out to them, the farmers who sold their land to the government approached a local leader who promised to do justice. The farmers were reportedly lured by some local leaders who promised them to offer plots and some money. In the vacant land, new a layout was drawn by the local leaders. But, according to officials, the beneficiaries will have only two years to time to construct houses, if not the land can be resume by the Revenue Department.

The farmers who lost their land are of the impression that they are being rendered justice by the local leader by allotting them a plot and offering some money, which they could not receive so far

“At least some leader came forward to do justice to us. We feel this is right as our repeated efforts to get justice failed. We might have purchased lands then itself at some other place had we been paid compensation in one go,” some farmers said.

Knowing about the layout in the government acquired land, Mandal Revenue Officer Swamy visited the house sites allotted area in Kulabgur on Thursday and Friday and interacted with locals for some time. Finally with police protection the illegal lay out was removed by the revenue officials. “It is a government acquired land and lay out there is illegal. Hence we have removed it,” said the MRO.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/4gvzsh/article32817214.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10OFFICIAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/layout-made-on-govt-acquired-land/article32817215.ece
215,2020/10/10,CPI(M) protests against LRS,"Move aimed at filling State coffers, allege Left party leaders

Terming the Government Order (GO Ms No 131) pertaining to the Layout Regularisation Scheme (LRS) as an ""unjustified move"" aimed at filling the State's coffers, cadres of the CPI(M) laid siege to Khammam Municipal Corporation (KMC) office here on Friday demanding withdrawal of the GO.

Holding placards containing slogans against GO 131, the demonstrators staged a sit-in protest at the entrance of KMC office.

Some of the placards read: ""Condemn levy of hefty penalties under the LRS - stop burdening people for filling up coffers"" and ""Take up LRS with nominal charges.""

Speaking at the protest, the party district secretary N Nageswara Rao came down heavily on the TRS government for allegedly imposing a huge financial burden on people at a time when the State is grappling with the ripple effects of COVID-19 pandemic. The persons at the helm have virtually issued an ultimatum to people to pay the stipulated charges before January 31, 2021 in the name of LRS, Mr Rao alleged, deploring that the move is tantamount to compelling people to pay hefty charges for filling up the State treasury in the current crisis situation.

Stir to continue

""People will teach a fitting lesson to the rulers at the hustings for such arbitrary measures,"" he said, vowing to continue the agitation against the GO 131 by enlisting the support of all sections. CPI (M) State committee member P Venkateshwara Rao, district executive committee members Y Srikanth, M Bharathi, Y Vikram, N Manohar, B Ramesh and others took part in the sit-in protest.

216,2020/10/10,Ground Zero | Killing love with caste pride,"In September, the murder of a Vysya man married to a Reddy woman by her family brought into focus once again the incidence of caste-related killings in Telangana. Serish Nanisetti, Marri Ramu and Abhinay Deshpande report on murders in the name of honour and the state’s inability to curb them

On June 10, 2020, Avanthi Reddy stepped into the sunlight, ready to run away from home and be reunited with her lover. While most people feared leaving their homes in the midst of a raging pandemic, sunlight meant freedom and a new beginning for the 23-year-old. Seven months earlier, Avanthi’s family had forced her to quit her job, seized her mobile phone, and locked her up in a room in her own home. She had finally managed to escape that day. Within two hours of eloping, she and her boyfriend Chinta Yoga Hemanth Kumar, 28, got married in a Santoshimata temple in Nalagandla.

But just over three months later, tragedy struck the young couple. On September 24, Hemanth was kidnapped and murdered, and his body thrown into a clump of bushes by the roadside in the neighbouring Sangareddy district of Telangana. According to Avanthi’s statement to the Cyberabad police, the murder was committed at the behest of her father, Donthireddy Laxma Reddy, and other family members. They were furious that their young daughter, who belonged to a family of nouveau riche landowners, had chosen as her husband a man from the Vysya community of traders. Unable to convince her to stay away from Hemanth, they hatched a plot to kill him.

The news about Hemanth’s death broke when Amrutha Varshini, 21, was beginning her 140-km journey from Miryalaguda to Hyderabad. The discussions on TV of yet another ‘honour killing’ vividly brought to Amrutha’s mind the gruesome details of her husband’s death two years earlier at the hands of killers hired by her father. Amrutha is from the Vysya community; her husband Pranay was a Dalit.

Amrutha, then five months pregnant, was walking with Pranay and her mother-in-law Premalatha towards their car parked outside a hospital gate when the assailant struck. Amrutha heard a loud thud. “I turned and I could not find Pranay for a moment. An unidentified killer who had approached us from behind hit my husband with a machete on his neck,” she recalls. The CCTV footage showed the two women screaming for help even as the killer, a tall man in a safari suit, inflicted a second blow on Pranay bringing him to the ground in a pool of blood. He died before he could be given emergency care. That fateful day was September 14, 2018.

“It was shocking that some people from my community cursed me for marrying Pranay even after he was murdered. They even formed a ‘fans association’ in the name of my father, Maruthi Rao,” she says. Rallies were taken out in support of Rao, a top builder. Rao and the hired assassin were later arrested by the police.

The police as counsellors

Caste-related killings are not new in Telangana. Citing the incidence of such crimes in Telangana and Uttar Pradesh, even before Hemanth and Pranay were murdered, Jharna Das Baidya, a Member of Parliament of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), made an impassioned plea in Parliament in 2017 for a special law to curb such crimes. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, there were 28 ‘honour killings’ in 2014, 251 in 2015, and 77 in 2016 across India.

Comment | Of love and honour killings

The 242nd Law Commission Report, too, sought a new law on ‘prevention of interference with the freedom of matrimonial alliances’. Following the Supreme Court ruling on March 27, 2018 in Shakti Vahini v. Union of India laying down preventive, punitive and remedial measures to stem such crimes, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued an advisory to all the States. It ordered the States to create special cells in “every district comprising the Superintendent of Police, the District Social Welfare Officer, and District Adi-Dravidar Welfare Officer to receive petitions/complaints of harassment of and threat to couples of inter-caste marriage”. The advisory stated that these special cells should create a 24-hour helpline to aid couples in distress. In Hyderabad, the helpline is called ‘Bharosa (trust)’.

However, instead of protecting young couples, the police is reportedly counselling them. Hemanth’s killing could have been averted, says Avanthi. “If the police official had not slammed the phone down when I called him up less than a month into my marriage, Hemanth would have been alive today. They refused to acknowledge the letter submitted by us about our safety (a few days after the marriage),” she says.

Comment | Honour killings are a separate horror

Avanthi says the police often summoned the family for counselling. She narrates the time she was called to the Chandanagar police station along with her in-laws on June 17. “There were more than 50 people from my parents’ side. They came in batches of 10, fell at my feet, spoke about ‘honour’ and asked me to come back home. This went on for five hours. Finally, close to midnight, I spoke to the police and left the station,” she recalls. Avanthi is now at her in-laws’ place. Her parental home is just a short distance away.

“It isn’t just about caste. My family spoke of differences in financial status too, but that’s also not much (between our families). They kept telling me about paruvu (Telugu for ‘pride’ or ‘honour’),” says Avanthi.

About 50 km from Hyderabad is Gomaram, the ancestral village of Donthireddy Laxma Reddy. Dalits say they are not allowed to enter the temples of Shiva and Hanuman there. “We are not allowed into the temples,” says Errala Seenu who lives in the basti nearby. Reddy’s house is adjacent to the temple. It is this caste pride that Reddy brought to Hyderabad and embossed in large letters on his three-storeyed mansion.

Tricked into stepping out

On September 24, Avanthi was about to open the refrigerator to plan lunch for the day when she heard a loud knock on the door. Her relatives stood outside, pleading with her to go home with them. They tried to persuade her to meet her parents. After 40 minutes of cajoling, they finally convinced Avanthi to meet her parents. But she insisted that Hemanth accompany her. Hemanth called his parents too. “My aunts and cousins were so anguished that I felt they were reaching out to us,” says Avanthi.

The couple got dressed for the visit. When they were about to get into their vehicle, Avanthi’s relatives forced them to get into the vehicles they had come in. “They were rough with us,” she says showing a bruise on her forearm.

Hemanth’s parents reached just in time to see the cars leaving the house. When Hemanth tried to wave to them to get their attention, Avanthi’s cousins pulled his hand into the car. But Hemanth’s parents saw him and tried to follow the vehicles. However, they were unable to tail the cars that zoomed away. Suspecting foul play, they alerted the police.

Meanwhile, fear gripped Avanthi when the cars turned towards the Nehru Outer Ring Road instead of turning towards her parents’ house. She asked Hemanth to jump out of the car, and they both did. Avanthi held Hemanth’s hand and ran barefoot shouting for help. But the passers-by and commuters at the Gopanpally Tanda crossroads turned out to be mute spectators. In the chase that ensued, her maternal uncle Yugandhar Reddy grabbed Hemanth and pushed him into the car with the hired killers. The car sped away on the Outer Ring Road. Avanthi sat by the roadside wailing for help, but no one came forward. When her in-laws arrived, the family rushed to the Cyberabad Commissionerate. There they were instructed to go to the nearby Gachibowli police station since this was a case of kidnapping. Losing precious time, Avanthi rushed to the Gachibowli police station to file a complaint. In less than an hour, about 10 of her relatives were detained and brought to the police station, but it was too late to save Hemanth. His body was discovered a few hours later; he had been strangled.

The police could have prevented the murder as most of the accused were in their custody in less than an hour of the kidnapping, says Avanthi. “They had enough time to save Hemanth, but they couldn’t.”

A tragic love story

Avanthi and Hemanth dated for eight years. She got to know him when his family moved from Guntur to Hyderabad to the same area that she lived in: Chandanagar. In 2013, when Avanthi was in Class 11, a lecturer informed Avanthi’s father about her relationship with Hemanth. Her father warned her against meeting him. When she completed her engineering degree, Donthireddy Laxma Reddy gifted his daughter an iPhone.

Avanthi joined an educational firm as a marketing coordinator in June 2019. The job entailed visits to schools in Hyderabad and its neighbouring districts. “During that time, Hemanth and I used to travel together. It was the only time we got to spend together. He used to pick me up and drop me at the sites,” she says.

But their happiness was short-lived. On November 27, 2019, a ‘stranger’ photographed the couple while they were together and sent it to Donthireddy Laxma Reddy. “That day, when I returned home at 8.30 p.m., I saw my whole family gathered at home. They began quizzing me about our relationship. They snatched my mobile phone to check my messages and calls, but found none. I used to delete messages and call logs after every conversation. But they stumbled upon Snapchat, where they found our photographs,” says Avanthi.

That was her last day of freedom. Avanthi’s family forced her to resign and stay at home. They took away her mobile phone and confined her to a room for seven months and six days before she managed to escape and get married. “I was under house arrest. Whenever my cousins visited us, I would secretly take their phones and call Hemanth. We never spoke for more than 20 seconds,” she says.

While Avanthi was confined at home, Hemanth, who owned an interior painting company, approached several astrologers with their horoscopes. The books he had read on astrology lie beside his garlanded photograph at home.

In the first week of June, three months after she last spoke to him, Avanthi called Hemanth and asked him if he was interested in marrying her. She proposed three possible dates: June 5, June 6 or June 10.

“As June 5 was my parents’ wedding anniversary, I did not want to ruin their day. So, I stayed at home. The next day, everyone was at home. Finally, on June 10, I left a letter at home and somehow sneaked out and called Hemanth. We rushed to the Santoshimata temple in Nalagandla and got married within an hour. We had rented a house at TNGOs Colony the previous day, so we went there,” says Avanthi.

On discovering that their daughter was missing, Avanthi’s parents lodged a kidnapping case against Hemanth. His parents were called in for questioning. The police asked Hemanth’s father Murali Krishna to surrender his phone.

On June 12, the newly-wed couple met Cyberabad Commissioner of Police, V.C. Sajjanar, who in turn told the Chandanagar police to close the case as both of them were consenting adults. Following this visit, the police counselled the families and sent them away. Later, Avanthi’s parents demanded that three properties which were registered under her name be transferred back to them.

Avanthi thought that her parents had reconciled to the marriage. However, her parents were now plotting Hemanth’s murder with the help of her uncle Yugandhar Reddy. Assassins were allegedly hired for ₹10 lakh and were paid ₹1 lakh in advance.

Editorial | Crime in the name of honour

“As a part of their plan, they did a recce of the area for more than two weeks. On September 24, they kidnapped Hemanth and strangled him,” says Madhapur in-charge Deputy Commissioner of Police, M. Venkateshwarlu.

Reconstructing the crime, Venkateshwarlu says Yugandhar Reddy and the three hired assassins kidnapped Hemanth and drove him all the way to Zaheerabad, which is more than 100 km from Hyderabad. While returning to Hyderabad, they strangled him inside the car and dumped the body in the bushes.

An inconsolable Avanthi told her father later that he may have “succeeded” in taking away her husband physically from her, but he cannot take away her love for him or annul the marriage. “All your money could not buy my husband’s love for me,” she said sobbing. “You lost your daughter as well.”

Awaiting trial

The state is directly supporting people indulging in such heinous acts, says Lakshmaiah, convener of the All India Struggle Association for Annihilation of Caste Inequalities. To illustrate his claim, he gives the example of the murder of a young Dalit woman, K. Sushrutha, and her four-month-old son, Devarsh, by her husband M. Ramesh, who belongs to a backward community, in Ghatkesar. The incident was reported on February 9, 2019.

Sushrutha and Ramesh fell in love and got married in 2015 against Ramesh’s parents’ wishes. Police records suggest that Ramesh, influenced by his family members who disapproved of his marriage with a Dalit woman, began distancing himself from his wife. The couple applied for divorce. But after giving birth to Devarsh, Sushrutha tried to reunite with her husband.

In the second week of February 2019, Ramesh called his wife and said they could try and sort out their issues. Sushrutha, who was living with her mother, agreed to meet him. Her brother dropped her and her son at Uppal on the outskirts of Hyderabad. Ramesh picked them up from there and took them to a secluded place in Ghatkesar. Police say following an argument between the couple, Ramesh throttled his wife and son to death and burnt their bodies with petrol.

Following the incident, Sushrutha’s family members approached the government seeking appointment of a special public prosecutor to argue the case under the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The government appointed lawyer V. Raghunath as the special public prosecutor in the case. “After examining the charge sheet filed by the police, I found that the investigation was not done properly. I suggested to the Rachakonda Police Commissioner that a further probe be done,” Raghunath says.

Interestingly, the accused moved the High Court saying Raghunath was actively associated with organisations supporting the victim and therefore cannot be their lawyer. The High Court gave an interim order suspending his appointment. Though the writ petition was pending final adjudication, the government issued an order revoking Raghunath’s appointment.

“If this is not an example of the state supporting the accused in murders driven by caste hatred, what is,” asks Lakshmaiah. The state’s biased approach can also be seen in the arrest of four of Sushrutha’s family members for carrying out hunger strikes in front of Ramesh’s house, he says. After demonstrating for 150 consecutive days, the four family members were arrested and lodged in Warangal prison for a week.

Sandhya, president of the Progressive Organisation of Women, who is fighting for the rights of women, feels it is inaccurate to describe killings related to inter-caste marriages as ‘honour killings’, as is the norm in India. The very term ‘honour killings’ means we are accepting the killers’ intentions and actions. “These murders are driven by class, caste and patriarchal hegemony,” she says.

218,2020/10/10,War of words in West Bengal over falling turban,"It’s an ‘insult of religious sentiment’, says BJP

The controversy over a turban of Sikh man falling off during the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) march earlier this week refused to die down even after West Bengal police said the turban had fallen off “in the scuffle”.

On Saturday, BJP leaders raked up the issue afresh and some tweeted visuals of the incident during Thursday’s rally. The BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya raised the issue on Saturday and questioned the silence of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Mr. Vijayvargiya said that the incident amounts to “insult of religious sentiment”.

Former governor of Tripura Tathagata Roy, who is seeking to play an active part in West Bengal politics, tweeted videos of the incident and accused the police of “mercilessly beating up and snatching and untying the turban of Sardar Balwinder Singh”. The West Bengal police has denied all these allegations saying it respects all religions.

“The officer specifically asked him to put his pagri back before the arrest. The attached photo has been clicked right before he was escorted to the police station. We remain committed to our duty to uphold law and order in the State,” the WB Police said on social media.

The police had accused Balwinder Singh of “carrying firearms”.

Videos of a firearm recovered from the 43-year-old Mr. Singh during the rally on Thursday were also aired by local television channels. He was arrested on Thursday after recovery of the firearm.

“The pagri had fallen off automatically in the scuffle that ensued, without any attempt to do so by our officer (visible in the video attached). It is never our intention to hurt the sentiments of any community,” the police said. The State unit president of BJP Dilip Ghosh had said Mr. Singh was a security personnel of a BJP leader

219,2020/10/10,"Soaring political temperatures, rallies in West Bengal trigger spike in COVID-19 cases","Norms of physical distancing grossly violated

In this past week Kolkata has witnessed more than half a dozen political rallies by the ruling Trinamool Congress, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and Left and Congress.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s October 3 rally to protest over the Hathras rape and murder, where she raised concerns about rising COVID-19 infection and admitted that “community transmission has begun in the State”, was followed by two more rallies on October 7 and October 10 by other Trinamool leaders.

Not to be left behind,the BJP led a march to the State Secretariat on October 7 to protest the killing of political workers in the State. The day saw clashes between the police and BJP workers, which triggered another round of protests and a candlelight rally the next day.

The Left and Congress party, who claim to provide the “third alternative” in the State held joint rallies on October 3 and October 10 in Kolkata. Both days saw huge gatherings.

In almost all these mass mobilisations the norms of physical distancing were violated and hundreds could be seen without masks.

Data released from the State Health Department suggests that the State has recorded an average of 3,500 infections and 60 deaths daily over the last few days. Kolkata alone is consistently recording its highest ever daily infections.

While doctors and public health professionals are concerned about the impact of the Durga Puja celebrations on the COVID-19 cases, the heightened political activity is resulting in a spike weeks ahead of the festivities.

With six months to go for Assembly elections, political observers said “no political party is letting go of any issue or opportunity that can help them get some votes.”

Biswanath Chakraborty, political observer and head of the department of political science at Rabindra Bharati University said, “As a citizen I feel let down at such an approach when the pandemic is far from being over. All parties are ready to risk precious lives but not willing to let go any opportunity to derive political mileage.”

Prof. Chakraborty said that West Bengal is a “political society where politics pervades every aspect of public life”. He said that not many people from the city’s civil society will come forward to raise questions. Other districts in West Bengal have seen similar rallies and mass gatherings over the past few days and “there seems to be a normalisation of COVID-19 pandemic”, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/r3hkj6/article32823681.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMWOMENSMARCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/soaring-political-temperatures-rallies-in-west-bengal-trigger-spike-in-covid-19-cases/article32823682.ece

The family members of Babu Lal Vaishnav, a 55-year-old temple priest, who was set on fire in Bukna village of Rajasthan's Karauli district, performed his last rites on October 10 after the State government announced an ex-gratia assistance of ₹10 lakh to the next of kin. The priest’s son, Deshraj, conducted the last rites in the presence of a large police force.

The priest was attacked on October 7 by five persons, who allegedly poured petrol on him and set him ablaze over a land dispute. The priest’s family has alleged that the accused wanted to encroach on land belong to the temple and were erecting a shed, leading to the dispute.

The State government also agreed to give a job on contract to a family member and release an assistance of ₹1.50 lakh for the construction of a house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. The Station House Officer of Sapotra police station and the patwari (revenue officer) of the village will be transferred and the allegation of their laxity in the incident probed, officials said.

Vaishnav’s family, who had received his body from Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh Hospital on October 9 after his death, had earlier refused to perform the last rites until their demands were met. Giving a political twist to the issue, BJP MP Kirodi Lal Meena joined the demonstration at Bukna and the party's three-member fact-finding team reached the village on October 10.

After the arrest of the main accused, Kailash Meena, the police also detained another accused and were searching for other suspects named in the murder case registered on the basis of the priest’s dying declaration.

A full-blown political war broke out in Odisha after the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation has sealed the office of local MP and BJP national spokesperson Aparajita Sarangi on Saturday for her alleged disregard for coronavirus (COVID-19) protocols like wearing mask and maintaining social distancing.

Ms. Sarangi hit back demanding closure of the Biju Janata Dal party office where leaders had reportedly thrown the guidelines to the wind while celebrating party leaders’ birthday.

Minister of State for Home Dibya Shankar Mishra on Friday wrote to Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai seeking to rein in Ms. Sarangi who is being accused of habitually violating the pandemic norms. She celebrated her birthday amidst scores of women supporters.

Early on Saturday, the BMC officials came to seal the Palaspalli office of the MP. According to the BMC, the office will remain closed for 15 days as it would have to be completely sanitised.

An enraged Ms. Sarangi presented 17 photographs showing BJD leaders attending functions at party office without masks and maintaining social distance.

She questioned the inaction of the authorities against virus-infected Minister Samir Ranjan Das and Satyabadi MLA Umakant Samantray for participating in the funeral procession of former Minister Pradeep Maharathy recently. Commissionerate police for Cuttack and Bhubaneswar had stood as mute spectators as hundreds of followers participated in the procession last week.

“The closure of my office is intended to halt developmental activities being taken up in wards and panchayats. As long as my office remains sealed, I will hold my grievance redressal sessions by the roadside,” said Ms. Sarangi.

She dared Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik to take action against his party leaders for violating the norms.

Mr. Samantray, against whom a case was lodged in the Seabeach police station, Puri, tendered an unconditional apology on Saturday for participating in the funeral procession despite testing positive.

Regional parties, including the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Saturday opposed implementation of the recently introduced property tax, first time ever, in J&K.

NC general secretary Ali Muhammad Sagar, who chaired a meeting in the Srinagar constituency on Saturday, “expressed concern over the imposition of property tax”.

“Amidst depressing economic activity and soaring unemployment, the government of India, far from doling out fiscal help and other supportive measures, wants to suck the life and blood of people. The imposition of the property tax has come at a time when the economy is reeling under slowdown and will overburden people,” Mr. Sagar.

He said the businesses have crumbled and people have lost their jobs in J&K after the unilateral abrogation of Articles 370, 35-A.

PDP leader Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra said, “The government is justifying August 5 in the name of development.

The Jammu and Kashmir government has set up special camps at 20 different locations here for registration of Kashmiri migrants for various centrally sponsored welfare schemes, a senior government official said on Saturday.

More than 110 counters have been opened at these 20 camps in places like Jagti, Nagrota, Muthi, Purkhoo, Gangyal, Channi Himmat, Bagwati Nagar, Bohri, Janipur and Durga Nagar on the demand of the migrant people seeking to register under various schemes, secretary of Disaster Management Relief, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Department Simrandeep Singh said.

Mr. Singh, who along with Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner T K Bhat, inaugurated one of the camps at Mini Township Jagti, said the camps have been organised under the ‘Jan Abhiyan’ and on the directions of Lt Governor Manoj Sinha.

Around 22,000 migrants registered for availing relief would be covered through special camps enabling them to avail the benefits of over 17 different schemes of various departments, he said.

“As...the registration process needs some documentation and people face a lot of problems to get themselves registered, this is for the first time that the government has decided to organise camps for hassle-free registration of eligible persons among the Kashmiri migrants,” Mr. Singh said.

During the camp a large number of migrant families and individuals of Jagti and adjoining areas were registered under various schemes, including Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Yojana, PM Suraksha Bima Yojna (PMSBY), PM Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), PM Mudra Yojana, old age pension scheme, Mission Indradanush, PM Ujjwala Yojna, National Talent Search Examination, and PM Special Scholarship Scheme (PMSSS).

Police registered a case under the Indian Penal Code Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) based on the woman's complaint, said Superintendent of Police Unnao Sureshrao A. Kulkarni.

The accused were identified as Bilal Khan and Faisal Khan. Bilal Khan is the son of the sister-in-law of the victim, while Faisal Khan is his friend, said the police.

Bilal was taking her to Agra in a car for some registry work related to land, the woman told police. The incident happened near the Behta Mujawar area of Unnao on Friday.

Talking to a television channel from a hospital, where she was receiving treatment, the woman, a resident of Lucknow, said the accused slapped her and pulled her hair and even “dug his teeth” into her. “The other person tried to force himself on me,” she said, alleging that the accused also bit her nose, tried to suffocate her with a pillow, and threw her out of the car thinking she was dead.

226,2020/10/10,Chhattisgarh CM promises law to offset impact of farm sector reforms,"The study is underway and officials have been working on it, adds the Chhattisgarh Chief Minister

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on Saturday said his government will hold a special assembly session and pass a law to ensure that farmers in the State are not affected by the new farm laws of the Centre.

Addressing a virtual rally of farmers and Congress workers here, he also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of misleading farmers on the issue.

Farmers in many states are protesting against the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

“These laws will have an (adverse) impact on farmers. Therefore we have to convene a special session of the assembly to bring a law to ensure that farmers and labourers of Chhattisgarh do not get affected by these central farm laws,” the Chief Minister said.

“The study is underway and officials have been working on it. Ministers have been looking into it. The day the proposal is presented before me, the schedule of special assembly session will be declared,” he said.

He also asked farmers to increase cultivation of oilseeds and pulses to ensure their sufficient availability in the state, expressing fear that after the implementation of the new law on essential commodities, hoarding of these commodities will increase.

“Modi has said store in your godowns as much as you can. It means traders will not focus on paddy purchase this time, but rather they will procure pulses, oilseeds, onion, etc. Prices of oilseeds and pulses may increase. You (farmers) should keep stock of oilseeds and pulses so that you can get good returns from traders,” the Chief Minister said.

Mr. Baghel also claimed that whatever Mr. Modi says, exactly opposite happens.

“Note ban was brought with a promise to unearth black money, but instead it facilitated conversion of black money into white. GST resulted in collapse of small and medium traders,” he said.

“Now Modi is saying these laws are in the interest of farmers but these laws are only meant to benefit the big businessmen,” the Chief Minister alleged.

He also dared the prime minister to declare that no procurement of farm produce will be done below the support price fixed by the Centre.

“Along with his `one nation, one market’ policy, he (the prime minister) should also ensure `one rate’ If he does so, I promise him on behalf of farmers in the entire nation that there will be no protest,” Baghel said.

Congress in-charge for Chhattisgarh P L Punia alleged at the rally that the new farm laws were enacted on the suggestions of big industrialists, without consulting farmers’ unions.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vf5z9n/article32588293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BHUPESHBAGHELKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/chhattisgarh-cm-promises-law-to-offset-impact-of-farm-sector-reforms/article32821327.ece

229,2020/10/10,Four militants killed in Kashmir operations,"Arms smuggling bid foiled on the LoC.

Four militants, including a “commander”, were killed in two separate operations in south Kashmir on Saturday. Meanwhile, a major bid to smuggle weapons on the Line of Control (LoC) was foiled in north Kashmir’s Kupwara.

A police spokesperson said two militants, who were trapped after receiving a specific input, were killed in the Chinigam area of Kulgam in a joint cordon and search operation.

The slain militants were identified as Tariq Ahmad Mir, a resident of Zangalpora Divsar in Kulgam, and Sameer Bhai alias Usman, a resident of Punjab in Pakistan. “Both were affiliated with the Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM),” the spokesperson said.

Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar appreciated the role of the security forces “for timely and safe evacuation of civilians during encounter and for maintaining strict restraint during the search of two mosques inside the cordon area”.

The police said that due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the bodies of the terrorists shall be sent to Handwara for burial, and only the nearest family members will be allowed to participate in the last rites.

In an encounter, which broke out on Saturday afternoon, two militants were killed in Pulwama’s Dadura area.

“Lashkar-e-Taiba’s top commander Zahid Nazir Bhat alias Zahid Tiger was among the two slain militants. It’s a big success for the security forces,” Mr. Kumar said.

Meanwhile, the Army foiled a bid to smuggle weapons along the LoC at the Keran Sector in north Kashmir’s Kupwara.

Four AK-47 rifles, eight magazines and 240 rounds were recovered during the anti-infiltration operation, where a rope was used across a river, the Army said.

“Pakistan has not stopped helping militants to infiltrate into this part of Kashmir and to fan violence. According to sources, 250-300 militants are ready to infiltrate at launching pads established on the other side of the LoC,” General Officer Commanding (GOC) 15 Corps Lieutenant General B.S. Raju said, on Saturday.

Speaking on the sidelines of the passing-out-cum attestation parade at JAKLI centre at Rangreth in Srinagar, GOC Raju said effective the counter infiltration mechanism has resulted in a decline in infiltration attempts by militants this year.

“Last year, till October, 126 militants had managed to enter into this part of Kashmir. However, this figure declined to just 30,” the Army officer said.

He said that local boys who had taken up arms had started to come back to the mainstream. “They are being given every chance to surrender,” he added.

230,2020/10/10,"Indian tag for ‘Pak’ butterfly, ‘Chinese’ dragonfly","Both insects have been recorded more than 1,100 km from their known areas of distribution in the neighbouring countries

A ‘Pakistani’ with wings has become the 1,328th Indian of its kind around the same time as another winged creature from China earned a similar status.

Both have been recorded by citizen scientists — non-professionals who contribute to scientific research and data collection — for the first time in the country, more than 1,100 km from their known areas of distribution.

The butterfly Spialia zebra was found in Dungarpur district of Rajasthan miles south of its known home comprising Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab province of Pakistan. The dragonfly Atratothemis reelsi was recorded in southern Arunachal Pradesh’s Namdapha Tiger Reserve, about 1,170 km west of its previously known nearest locality of Xiaoqikong Park in China’s Guizhou Province.

The sighting of the two insects was published in the latest issue of Bionotes, a quarterly newsletter for research on life forms.

“The zebra skipper or Spialia zebra has added to the richness of Rajasthan’s orchid belt comprising Phulwari ki Nal Wildlife Sanctuary and Sita Mata Wildlife Sanctuary,” Mukesh Panwar told The Hindu from Sagwara in Dungarpur district.

He collected a specimen of the zebra skipper and provided photographs for the Butterfly Research Centre at Bhimtal in Uttarakhand to record it as the first of its kind in the country.

“India now has 1,328 species of butterflies. The zebra skipper is difficult to observe because it is quite small and flies rapidly low over the ground,” said Peter Smetacek of the Bhimtal centre.

In Pakistan, the butterfly has been recorded from areas where plants need very little water, and from cultivated areas in lowlands or arid foothills.

‘Bonus bug’

Minom Pertin, Roshan Upadhaya, Tajum Yomcha and Arajush Payra had on May 19 undertaken a butterfly-spotting trip along the Miao-Vijaynagar road through the Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh.

They ended up recording a dragonfly representing the westernmost range of its species and adding to the Indian Odonata fauna. Odonata is an order of predatory insects comprising dragonflies and damselflies.

“It was a bonus find, never before recorded in the eastern Himalayas. It augurs well for the biodiversity of this region,” Mr. Pertin said.

The quartet’s finding was reviewed by Parag Rangnekar, a Goa-based entomologist specialising in butterflies and dragonflies.

The Atratothemis reelsi was found to resemble other blackish dragonflies, one of them confined to Australia. Its genital section distinguished it from the others.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/h8mhbk/article32821055.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DSC2378,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/indian-tag-for-pak-butterfly-chinese-dragonfly/article32821057.ece

232,2020/10/10,"Hathras gang rape | Police, media and the spectacle of grief in Boolgarhi","Hathras victim’s family struggles to come to terms with intrusive media presence, changing narratives, and a formidable security presence in the village.

A week after the Hathras victim of alleged gang rape and brutal assault was consigned to flames in the dead of night, the family is struggling to come to terms with the intrusive gaze of the media, changing narratives on the basis of selective leaks, and a formidable security presence in the village.

Hathras gang rape | A long caste feud, a horrific crime, and a sudden cremation

“We have said enough to the government, now justice should be done and we should be allowed to grieve in peace,” said the victim’s aunt, squatting at the door behind which the family shuts itself for several hours during the day.

When this correspondent visited Boolgarhi on Thursday, the road to the village was thickly dotted with khaki-clad police personnel. Two mobile lavatories indicated the long hours they had been putting in to secure the village that has seen an unusual rush of political delegations and media teams over the last week.

There was an imposing metal detector in the outer courtyard that was bustling with relatives and activists last week. Now, there is a sprawling tent for housing policemen between their shifts. The narrow lane leading to the residence is also lined with policemen.

A female police constable holding a heavy register asks visitors to submit their details. There are eight CCTV cameras, multiple LED bulbs, and two “shadows” for each member of the family to ensure that no movement of the family and no questions of the media could go unnoticed. An official claimed, “This is what the family and the situation demanded.”

As the news of the family approaching the Allahabad High Court against their illegal detention spreads, two female officers request the father of the victim to come out and record a clarification. Answering in half sentences to leading questions, he says he is satisfied with the security and is not planning to shift out. He denies that he asked anybody to approach the High Court on his behalf.

When they leave, he mumbles, “What to say...every word is accounted for and could be used against us...we are simple people...is mahaul main suraksha to chahiye, par (but we need security in this atmosphere)...”

Meanwhile, impatient crews of a section of electronic media are looking for ways to swoop onto the family. One of them starts doing a “sting” on unsuspecting family members of the victim.

Behind these “journalists” was an official, doing his own “sting” for “official reasons”. He rushed in to record every time the victim’s sister-in-law (wife of the victim’s elder brother), who was present in the village, gets agitated with the constant probing. She says, “A narrative is being built to malign the victim by leaking the call details. It is a conspiracy to discredit us. The victim was uneducated and didn’t know how to use a phone.”

She says she usually keeps the said phone, which is in her father-in-law’s name. Call data records reportedly show calls made from Sandeep’s (one of the accused) phone to the phone of the victim's brother, and vice-versa.

The family of Chanderpal, uncle of the victim’s father who purportedly was one of the four close relatives of the family who participated in the last rites, is worried because the old man has been taken to Hathras to record his statement. “He went to the cremation ground after his nephew asked him to do so. When he reached there, the pyre was already lit,” says Prakash, his son.

Policemen took wooden sticks and cow dung cakes from their residence, adds Prakash, and says, “But at that time, the body hasn’t reached the village and we didn’t know that they would burn it without even showing us the face.”

Prakash and his wife maintain they had heard of an argument between the two families about the phone calls made by Sandeep, one of arrested accused. “I don’t know the exact date but it happened before the lockdown. When the father of the victim complained, Guddu, Sandeep’s father, had slapped him. After that, Sandeep left the village,” says Prakash, adding his cousin did not reveal it because “in a village such things bring a bad name only to the girl”.

While Guddu and his wife are not in the village, Rajwati, mother of Ramu Singh, another arrested accused, who is also Sandeep’s uncle, says she is not aware of the incident but confirms that Sandeep had left the village in March to work with a courier company in Delhi and returned about 10 days before the incident.

She says that though Sandeep has attended high school, he could not write a letter. “I cannot say about Sandeep,but my son Ramu was at the dairy at the time of the incident,” she insisted.

Some of the men of the accused’s household have returned to the village and have recorded their statements with the Special Investigation Team (SIT). “We hope we will get justice,” says Hariom, Ramu’s elder brother. “We are not aware whether the girl and Sandeep were in touch and have come to know about the letter only through the media,” he says.

But he has no answer as to why it took Sandeep so long to divulge the details of the “relationship”, considering he was arrested on September 19. “We were all hiding because earlier the police would detain anybody related to the accused,” he said.

Towards the end of the day, when The Hindu asked the father of the victim about the phone calls, he said, “The purpose of those calls should also be revealed. It could have been part of his conspiracy. She has already died a thousand times in the last week...”

Seema Kushwaha, lawyer of the victim’s family, who will accompany the four members of the family before the Allahabad High Court’s Lucknow bench on October 12, says, “Even if the calls were made, did it give the accused the right to rape and kill the victim?” she wonders, refuting the honour killing narrative. “The victim’s first statement, made at the Chandpa police station on September 14, was enough to invoke sections of rape,” asserted Ms. Kushwaha.

“Burning the body without the family’s consent was inhuman,” she said. “If they sensed a law and order problem, more force could have been called in.”

Refusing to divulge the details of the investigation, Vineet Jaiswal, Superintendent of Police, Hathras, said the police have been “fair” in registering the FIR for violations of Section 144. “We have registered an FIR against a former BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) MLA for holding a panchayat at his residence. Rashtriya Swarn Parishad’s Pankaj Dhwajbhaiya has been warned that he would be arrested under Section 151 of the CrPC if he is seen in the area.”

On what material was used to light the pyre, Mr. Jaiswal said it was being looked into by the SIT.

Family members of a 19-year-old Dalit woman who died after allegedly being raped by four men in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district will appear before the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court amid tight security on October 12.

Hathras Superintendent of Police Vineet Jaiswal on Saturday told PTI that the district judge of Hathras has been appointed as the nodal officer for the appearance of the Hathras victim’s family member before the high court.

The police and district administration are working on an elaborate plan in this regard as to how many family members will go and when they will depart from Hathras.

“The Hathras police will be responsible for their security and a detailed plan is being made,” Mr. Jaiswal said.

Sixty security personnel have been deployed and eight close circuit television (CCTV) cameras installed at the house of the alleged gangrape victim in her village in Boolgarhi area in Hathras to ensure the safety of her family members, according to police.

DIG Shalabh Mathur, who has been sent to Hathras from Lucknow as a nodal officer, had told PTI on Friday that if needed a control room would also be established there. With the help of CCTV cameras, the house of the victim was being monitored round-the-clock, police said.

The Hathras SP said a register of visitors was being maintained by policemen at the entry of the house.

“Shocked” by the alleged gang-rape and murder of the 19-year-old Dalit woman and her forcible cremation subsequently, the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court on October 1 had summoned top government officials to the court.

A division Bench of Justice Rajan Roy and Justice Jaspreet Singh had ordered the Uttar Pradesh Additional Chief Secretary, State police chief and an Additional Director General of Police to appear before it on October 12 to explain the incident.

234,2020/10/10,"Resolve Tawang church issue within a week, demands Arunachal Christian body","A pastor of the Revival Church was arrested on charges of constructing a church illegally

A Christian forum has set the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Arunachal Pradesh a week’s deadline to resolve the issue of a church allegedly being constructed illegally in Buddhist-majority Tawang.

The police in Tawang, about 450 km northwest of State capital Itanagar, had on October 6 arrested Joseph Singhi, a pastor on charges of constructing a church without any land allotment. The pastor, arrested on the basis of a complaint by the district Land Revenue and Survey officer, was released on bail hours later.

The police also detained and interrogated eight others associated with the Tawang Christian Revival Church.

In a memorandum to Chief Minister Pema Khandu on October 9, the Arunachal Christian Forum (ACF) said the government was ‘blocking’ the construction of a permanent structure where a temporary church has existed since 1999.

The ACF said repeated applications for land allotment were never processed by the local authorities and a similar request was also made to the Chief Minister’s Office in 2003. The forum asked the CMO to resolve the issue within a week or face a “democratic protest”.

“India is a secular country and the right to freedom of religion is enshrined in the Constitution to enable its citizens to freely profess and practice their religious beliefs. Quoting the Supreme Court’s 2009 ban on unauthorised construction of religious structures on public streets, roads and public utility spaces is simply unjustified here,” ACF president Toko Teki said.

The Arunachal Pradesh Christian Revival Church Council had earlier said the Christians have no intention to disturb the way of life in Tawang, known for a 339-year-old Buddhist monastery.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/resolve-tawang-church-issue-within-a-week-demands-arunachal-christian-body/article32820596.ece
235,2020/10/10,Assam to shut down government-run madrasas as part of policy against religious education,"Director of Secondary Education told to transfer 148 teachers to general schools

The Assam government has set in motion the process of transferring 148 teachers after a decision to close down State-run madrasas or Islamic educational institutions.

“...I am directed to inform you that Government has decided to close madrasas. Therefore, the 148 numbers of madrasa contractual teachers may be shifted to schools under general secondary education,” read an official memo from Assam Secondary Education Department’s Deputy Secretary S.N. Das to the Director of Secondary Education earlier this month.

Copies of the memo were sent to the office of Education Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and the mission director of Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan in Assam.

“You are therefore requested to submit a formal proposal” regarding the transfer of the 148 contractual teachers, the letter from Mr. Das said.

The Assam government a couple of years ago decided to close down madrasas and tols (educational institutions focussing on Sanskrit learning) under State boards as “religious teachings cannot be carried out with government funds in a secular country”.

Dr. Sarma on Thursday said that the State government would come up with separate notifications for madrasas and tols in November.

The Assam government runs 614 madrasas, while 900 are run privately, mostly by the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind. There are about 100 government-run and 500 private Sanksrit tols in the State.

While the madrasa education system started in Assam in 1780, Sanskrit education became official under the Assam Sanskrit Education Act, 1957.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-to-shut-down-government-run-madrasas-as-part-of-policy-against-religious-education/article32820108.ece
236,2020/10/10,Group of Ministers sets October 30 deadline for report on ST status for 6 Assam communities,"Tribal groups are against the move that they fear would eat into their rights and privileges

Assam’s Group of Ministers has set an October 30 deadline for submitting to the Centre its final report on granting Scheduled Tribe (ST) status to six communities.

The six communities are Chutiya, Koch-Rajbongshi, Matak, Moran, Tai-Ahom and ‘Tea Tribe’, some of which are categorised as Other Backward Classes. The State’s tribes are opposed to granting ST status to these communities.

The Group of Ministers headed by Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma met the leaders of the six communities on Friday. Later in the evening, he said “60% of the issues” pertaining to granting ST status had been resolved.

“We will submit the final report to the Centre on or before October 30,” he said, adding the State government would wait for the Centre’s decision on the report for the next step.

Dr Sarma insisted the issue was not linked to the 2021 Assembly election.

The Assam government had in January 2019 formed the Group of Ministers to recommend the rights and benefits for new STs. The Centre had sought the group after the introduction of the Constitution (Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill in the Parliament.

Prior to meeting the representatives of the six communities, the Group of Ministers had met leaders of the Coordination Committee of the Tribal Organisations of Assam and its constituents. These organisations advised “freezing” the current list of tribes and finding “other ways” of providing benefits to the six communities so that the rights and privileges of the existing STs are not “diluted”.

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has invited criticism for saying all the indigenous communities and genuine Indian citizens need to unite to be fully insured against “Mughal aggression”.

Speaking at an induction programme organised by the State Bharatiya Janata Party for more than 700 members of two tribal groups on Friday, Mr. Sonowal said the indigenous communities should come together to defeat the “conspiracy of illegal foreigners” to take over Assam.

“The bhumiputra [sons of the soil] are not fully safe and secure because the Mughal aggression is still on,” he said after the members of Bodoland People’s Front, one of the BJP’s two regional allies, and United Bodo People’s Organisation, representing Bodo people living outside the Bodoland Territorial Council, joined the saffron party.

Mr. Sonowal said differences and misconceptions existing among the indigenous communities of Assam must be removed for preserving their self-esteem and self-respect.

“Members of indigenous communities have lost their rights over land in many districts of Assam. What will be left for us if we lose the right over our lands?” he said, adding that a conspiracy was on to finish off the indigenous people by inciting them to fight one another.

While the Opposition Congress and All India United Democratic Front said the Chief Minister should spell out what he meant by ‘Mughal’, former BJP leader and anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act activist Mira Borthakur took to social media to slam his governance.

A local court in the city heard a domestic violence case involving a Major-ranked officer of the Indian Army well past midnight on Thursday.

The officer was sent into Army custody by the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate who heard the matter. The court continued the hearing till 1.30 a.m.

“Army officers generally respect women. It was the reason for which my parents chose him for me. It was an arranged marriage. But I have been subjected to both physical and mental torture for years now,” the wife of the officer told the court.

“Family members, including my husband, mother-in-law, father-in-law and sister-in-law, never missed any opportunity to torture me. For the sake of my marital life, I kept quiet for years. When the torture became unbearable, I decided to take the assistance of the police,” she said.

“In February 2018, my husband assaulted me in New Delhi. I had then called the police and in the presence of police personnel, the matter was settled. Subsequently, he stopped talking to me and severed all ties,” the woman said.

241,2020/10/10,Coronavirus | Odisha government falls prey to fake news on Oxford University study,"A dubious report lauding measures to contain COVID-19 in Ganjam district was tweeted by CMO

The Odisha government seems to have fallen prey to fake news. A dubious news report citing a purported Oxford University study that praised measures to contain COVID-19 spread in Ganjam district was promoted by the top Odisha administration on social media.

Quoting the news report, Office of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik jumped to highlight the ‘recognition’ by tweeting, “Ganjam earned praise from @UniofOxford for its successful model of #COVID-19 infection prevention. The district excelled in #CovidManagement by empowering sarpanchs, forming committees in villages for intensive screening and by ensuring proper healthcare.”

As soon as the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) put out the tweet on Thursday, the official handle of the district magistrate of Ganjam too tweeted, “Ganjam Model of COVID Management got recognized by @UniofOxford for successful infection prevention strategies. Our gratitude and appreciation to Team Ganjam.”

When doubts were cast on the purported study, the CMO deleted the tweet in English, but it continued with the Odia tweet which quoted another website. Almost all vernacular dailies carried the reported Oxford University study prominently on Friday.

When asked about the study, Ganjam District Collector Vijay Amruta Kulange said he did not have the study, but promised to find it out later in the day.

The news report quoted by the CMO, Odisha says, “the first case was found on May 2 in Ganjam district of Odisha. In August, the rate of getting the patient reached 59%, after which measures were taken, now 98% of the 20430 patients have been fully vaccinated, only 188 patients are left.”

In an apparent hurry to highlight the government’s achievement, the CMO ignored the content of the news with bizarre description — “now 98% of the 20430 patients have been fully vaccinated, only 188 patients are left.”

Instead of the Oxford University study, Mr. Kulange provided a document titled ‘Ganjam Model on COVID Management’ which says, “with the receipt of more than 4 lakh migrants in a district of the size and scale of Ganjam, the district has had a long-drawn battle with COVID.”

“It was only after a period of time in August that the numerous initiatives taken by the administration such as high testing levels, red zone management, containment measures, healthcare facilities and community involvement began to show results,” it says.

“More than 97% of positive cases have recovered so far and the doctors and all paramedic staffs have had numerous sleepless nights to save lives of thousands of COVID positive patients,” the administration boasts.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xw3r6q/article32818141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THPATNAIK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-odisha-government-falls-prey-to-fake-news-on-oxford-university-study/article32818142.ece

“They were indulging in in song and dance with utter disregard to COVID guidelines issued under the National Disaster Management Act and the earnest repeated appeals made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the same,” Mr. Mishra mentioned.

“I would not have brought this to your notice, had this been the first occasion where the MP has blatantly violated COVID guidelines. In addition to repeated advisories, warnings and booking of at least three cases against the MP for violation of COVID guidelines, there is no improvement in her behaviour,” he said.

Stating that these irresponsible acts would put her, people near to her and the public at large at grave risk of life, Mr. Mishra said, “Such behaviour on the part of a people’s representative will demotivate the COVID warriors and is an insult to all those who have lost their lives.”

The Odisha Home Minister urged Mr. Rai to bring this to the notice of the Prime Minister and the Union Home Minister, and advise the MP to not endanger the lives of the people of Bhubaneswar, where 109 persons and five COVID-19 healthcare workers have lost their lives in the pandemic.

The complaint came close on the heels of a similar complaint against State Education Minister Samir Ranjan Das and Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MLA Umakant Samantray. The senior BJD leaders were accused of participating in a funeral ceremony despite testing positive for COVID-19 in Puri.

Priyadarshan Patnaik, convener of the Jagannath Sena, had lodged a complaint against two BJD leaders at the Seabeach police station, Puri for attending the last rites of Pradeep Maharathy, who died recently.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/od9dtr/article32817670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APARAJITASARANGIKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odisha-moves-centre-against-bhubaneswar-mp-aparajita-sarangi/article32817671.ece
243,2020/10/10,OIL resumes Andaman offshore operations,"Its last activity there was 3 decades ago

Battling blowout at a natural gas well near its “home” in eastern Assam, Oil India Limited (OIL) has resumed its operations off the Andaman Islands after almost three decades.

OIL, headquartered in Dibrugarh district’s Duliajan, last handled any exploration and production activity off the islands in the Bay of Bengal in the 1980s. The public sector ‘Navaratna’ company resumed its seismic survey in its Andaman offshore blocks on October 8.

Seismic survey usually precedes all oil and gas exploration activity.

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, India’s largest exploration company, had drilled six wells off the Andaman shores during the 2013-14 fiscal without commercial success or production.

“After 2014, we are the only company to venture into the Andaman waters for exploration activities. But while ONGC were in deep waters, we are getting into shallow waters with a sophisticated multipurpose data acquisition vessel,” an OIL spokesperson said.

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas had awarded 32 blocks under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy through two rounds of bidding in January and February, 2019. OIL won bids for 12 blocks, including two covering an area of 9,616.7 sq km in shallow waters off the shores of Andaman Islands.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/oil-resumes-andaman-offshore-operations/article32817360.ece
244,2020/10/10,Amarinder accuses Badal of trying to hijack farmers’ stir,"CM asks him to answer key questions surrounding farm laws

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday asked Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal to answer three key questions surrounding the agriculture laws, accusing him of trying to hijack the farmers’ agitation to push his own party’s agenda.

The Chief Minister said that Mr. Badal should refrain from commenting on the farm laws till he gives satisfactory answers to the three questions, the answers to which every single farmer of Punjab wanted to know.

“Why did Harsimrat Kaur Badal not oppose the farm ordinances when they were first approved by the Union Cabinet, of which she was then a member? Why did Sukhbir not support the State government at the all-party meeting he (Captain Amarinder) had convened to evolve a consensus against the anti-farmer legislations? And why did the Akalis boycott the Vidhan Sabha session in which the other parties (barring BJP) had voted in favour of the resolution on the agricultural laws?”

Captain Amarinder said he had been posing these questions to the Badals for the past several weeks but the Akali leaders had been persistently ignoring them.

Reacting to Mr. Badal’s so-called request to the Prime Minister to talk to farmer organisations and to listen to the voice of the people, the Chief Minister asked why he did not remind the PM of his responsibility towards farmers all those years he was with the BJP.

Direct talks

Earlier Mr. Badal had said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should address the grievances of the farmers by holding direct talks with farmer organisations to come out with a solution which was acceptable to all.

Mr. Badal announced that the SAD would initiate formation of a national pro-farmer front by coordinating with other like mind regional parties surrounding the issue of farm laws and take it to a logical conclusion.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amarinder-accuses-badal-of-trying-to-hijack-farmers-stir/article32817348.ece
245,2020/10/10,Artist M Dileef released his cartoon book called ‘I Can’t Breathe’,"The Kozhikode-based artist is chasing a world record with what is, perhaps, the longest political cartoon strip known to Indians

A cartoon book that is 400 metres long, features 800 different frames and weighs 75 kilograms — this is what M Dileef spent six months of lockdown to produce.

Dileef recently launched his magnum opus named I Can’t Breathe at an exhibition in Kozhikode, Kerala in a bid to set a Guinness World Record. “I glued drawing papers together to get the required length. I then folded it to make a book and put it inside a wooden box. It was a great experience and I am waiting to get the certificate from officials,” he says.

M Dileef

I Can’t Breathe touches upon issues of the common man in a series of political cartoons. Featuring Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as main characters, the cartoon book calls to attention headline-grabbing issues of the recent past, including demonetisation, NRC, UAPA and the Farm Bills 2020. “I have followed news carefully to have a clear understanding of the matters, and have also taken care to be unbiased while presenting the issues,” says Dileef, adding that it was a back-breaking task.

“It was not the drawing part that was tough. My working hours were long. I took a break only for food. I got blisters on my hand after holding my pen continuously for long hours,” he remarks. Dileef is now working on a colour scheme for the cartoon book and also has plans to exhibit it in Sharjah, UAE in November.

He believes that humour and criticism employed in political cartoons is a powerful tool. “It is a simple art form that everyone can understand,” says the cartoonist, adding, “I was inspired by the works of artist Ajit Nainan [to take up this profession]. They made me realise the power of this medium.” Dileef is no stranger to such World Record attempts; his first was in 2014, when he set the record for the biggest badminton racquet installation in Kozhikode. “I made it with wood, iron and plastic thread,” he says. He also made a handwritten copy of the Quran that took him three years to complete; his work found a mention in the Arabian World Records. “It was one kilometre long,” he says, adding, “Such records help us artists take our work to a global audience.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/yzahu3/article32820423.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/from-the-exhibition,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/artist-m-dileef-released-his-cartoon-book-named-i-cant-breathe/article32820424.ece

The forest range officer of Periyanaickenpalayam forest range, a forester, and a forest guard were given transfers within the Coimbatore Forest Division for alleged negligence in handling a case related to seizure of venison.

The action was taken against forest range officer S. Suresh and the two others after an inquiry by a special team of the department.

The officials had imposed a fine of ₹10,000 each on two women namely N. Indirani and R. Shanthamani from Avvai Nagar at Naickenpalayam for possessing meat of spotted deer on September 29. The women, who worked in a grove belonging to a popular south Indian actor’s sister at Palamalai foothills, had confessed to the officers that they procured the meat of the deer that was found dead half a kilometer from the grove.

After allegations came up that the officers spared a few others involved in the offence, the District Forest Officer formed a special team for inquiry.

The team found that four more women and seven men were involved in the wildlife offence. The department collected a total fine of ₹1 lakh from the 13 persons.

As part of the campaign organised by Nallatchi Iyakkam (Good Governance Movement), he issued to motorists on Bharathi Park Road in Saibaba Colony pamphlets containing messages on the importance of voting for “qualified” candidates.

“The public must vote for the right candidate without bias for any party,” he told The Hindu, noting that Nallatchi Iyakkam stresses that every party has qualified candidates. “If there are no such candidates in any party, they must vote for an independent candidate.

Stating that the shops set up by traders on either side of the road that leads to Uzhavar Sandhai (farmers’ market)at Sampath Nagar here occupied road space and sold vegetables for higher price, public wanted the shops regulated.

A total of 630 farmers have registered with the market run by the Department of Agricultural Marketing. The market functions from 5.30 a.m. to 8 a.m. every day. Farmers from many parts of the district bring their produce and sell it to the public directly.

Public complained that traders bought the vegetables from farmers and sold it outside the market for higher price. “There are over 50 shops outside the market where traders sell vegetables at a higher price,” said V. Sampath of Chinnamuthu Street.

Shops set up on both sides of the road leave little space for the public to move to the market, forcing them to buy vegetables from the traders. “Vegetables are not available in the market after 7 p.m., while they are available with the traders after that,” said Jothi Priya of Sampath Nagar.

254,2020/10/10,‘Detection of more COVID-19 positive cases helps prevent infection spread’,"The measures it has put in place in the city last few days has helped detect more COVID-19 positive cases, particularly that of asymptomatic persons, says the Coimbatore Corporation.

As of September 29, the city had 3,372 active COVID-19 cases. And, as of October 9, this increased to 3,673 cases. The increase in number has to do with the Corporation increasing the number of samples and taking steps for early detection of cases, says Corporation Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian.

Though the number has increased, it has helped contain the spread of the disease as can be seen from the increase in number of streets that are free of COVID-19 cases – from 5,876 streets to 5,986 streets.

This means that the Corporation has been detecting more cases. Most of the cases are of persons who show no symptoms and this detection is at a very early stage of infection, thanks to the door-to-door survey that the Corporation is carrying out, the Commissioner explains.

He says the Corporation has covered two times almost every household in the city in the door-to-door survey, aimed at identifying people with influenza-like infection or COVID-19 symptoms. On identification of such persons, the door-to-door surveyors inform the medical team concerned. The team then lifts samples for testing.

This along with fever camps has helped contain the spread, the Commissioner says and adds that very soon the city will see a reduction in number of active cases.

City Health Officer S. Raja says the Corporation conducting around 100 fever clinics a day for the last three months has also helped identify people with fever symptoms and keep a tab on people prone to infection.

And, the Corporation reverting to quarantining areas with positive cases has curtailed the movement of people within the containment zone and prevented others from entering such zones, he adds.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/pm90pi/article32825949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB11COVIDROUNDUP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/detection-of-more-covid-19-positive-cases-helps-prevent-infection-spread/article32823726.ece

258,2020/10/10,Suresh was ahead of his time: Sujith,"Haven’t seen many naturals like him, says Sunil Oasis

On Friday night, even as cricket fans were glued to the IPL match between Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals at Sharjah, a disturbing news emerged from Alappuzha. M. Suresh Kumar, reports said, had ended his life. It was a tragic end to a remarkable cricketer, at the age of 47.

The left-arm spinner was so good and a complete package that he could have represented the senior Indian team, felt those who have played with and against him. He did play for the India Under-19 team — and was the first from Kerala to do so — but had the potential to achieve more.

Sujith Somasundar, former India opener and currently head of education at the National Cricket Academy, is one of those who believe Suresh could have had a brighter career.

Extremely talented

“I have played against him in so many matches, from the Under-15 days through the Ranji Trophy, and found him extremely talented,” Sujith told The Hindu over phone from Bengaluru.

“He was a superb spinner, had a fluid action, mixed it up well and had a good loop.”

He also has vivid memories of Suresh as a fielder. “He was one of the best fielders I have ever come across,” said Sujith.

“I would say he was even ahead of his times when it came to fielding. He specialised in running out batsman with direct hits pretending to aim at the other end.

“And he did that on the outfields of Kerala which was full of pebbles and devoid of grass.”

Like Sujith, Sunil Oasis too is a contemporary of Suresh. The former Kerala captain was his teammate for over a decade.

Gifted player

“We have played together in junior cricket too,” said Sunil. “He was a gifted cricketer. I haven't seen many naturals like him in my career.”

He said it was unfortunate that Suresh did not go on to play for the senior Indian team. “With some luck, he easily could have,” he said.

“He was one of the best spinners in India at the time. Given his exceptional skills as a fielder and usefulness as a batsman, he would have excelled in ODIs.”

Sunil remembers Suresh was effective on any surface but particularly difficult on turners. “I have several memories about him, including the way he ran Yuvraj Singh out in a Deodhar Trophy match in that typical fashion of his,” he said.

“He was also the bowler who used to get Rahul Dravid out most when Kerala played Karnataka.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/66jcnp/article32822986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11SURESH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/suresh-was-ahead-of-his-time-sujith/article32822987.ece
259,2020/10/10,Indian Premier League 2020 | Kohli piles on the misery for CSK,"RCB captain’s expertly paced 90 n.o. consigns Dhoni’s men to their fifth defeat

After seven matches, Chennai Super Kings’ mid-term report card will just read ‘lack of intent’. The side produced yet another dull display on Saturday, going down to Royal Challengers Bangalore by 37 runs at the Dubai International Stadium.

Chasing 170 for victory, CSK’s batting woes played out in a familiar manner. The openers failed to give a good start and the middle-order showed no urgency, as last edition’s runner-up crawled to its fifth defeat of the season.

Shifting gears seamlessly

Earlier, Virat Kohli slammed an unbeaten 90 off just 52 balls (4x4, 4x6) in an innings where he seamlessly shifted gears between caution and aggression.

At the end of the 15th over, both teams were in a similar situation (RCB: 95/4; CSK: 96/3), but CSK did not have someone to produce a knock like Kohli’s. The Indian skipper cut loose in the last five overs to power RCB to 169, which proved more than enough.

On the field, Kohli was brilliant with his calls, using the quicks to unsettle the openers before Washington Sundar removed Faf du Plessis and Shane Watson cheaply.

Ambati Rayudu (42) and debutant N. Jagadeesan (33) weren’t able to accelerate, and the RCB bowlers used the scoreboard pressure to close out the match without much trouble.

Electing to bat, RCB had a sedate start, with Aaron Finch falling early and Devdutt Padikkal not at his fluent best. Padikkal (33) and Kohli steadied things before Shardul Thakur removed the former and AB de Villiers in the 11th over to reduce RCB to 67 for three.

It was then that Kohli, who had reached his 50 off 39 balls, turned it on.

In the 18th over, he hit Sam Curran for two sixes, the second one being the shot of the day — an audacious flick over square-leg.

260,2020/10/10,Indian Premier League 2020 | Kings choke and surrender,"KKR scampers home by two runs as everything unravels for KXIP at the end.

When two teams owned by Bollywood superstars clash, you know you are in for an entertaining evening.

And Saturday was no different as Shah Rukh Khan witnessed some edge-of-the-seat action with his team, Kolkata Knight Riders, pulling off a narrow two-run win over the Preity Zinta co-owned Kings XI Punjab in an Indian Premier League clash.

Chasing 165 at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, Kings XI seemed to be in control till the 18th over of the chase, with captain K.L. Rahul on 71 off 55 balls.

Two quick wickets

However, things went horribly wrong thereafter. Needing 20 off 12 balls, KXIP lost two wickets — including Rahul’s — in the space of three balls in the 19th over bowled by Prasidh Krishna.

It was then seven needed off the last delivery to take the game to the Super Over, but Glenn Maxwell missed out on a six by inches.

Earlier, things looked promising for Kings with openers Rahul and Mayank Agarwal forging a 115-run partnership. Rahul got a reprieve in the second over after Andre Russell dropped a chance at mid-off.

Making use of the opportunity, Rahul and Agarwal (56, 39b, 6x4, 1x6) went about their business calmly.

Even when Shubman Gill caught Agarwal at deep mid-wicket off Prasidh, it seemed to be too late for the Knights. But the game took a dramatic turn after Nicholas Pooran’s exit. KXIP’s decision to promote youngster Prabhsimran Singh at No. 4 — ahead of Maxwell — backfired. The youngster succumbed to pressure and managed just four runs off seven balls.

Batting first, KKR struggled till the 11th over, making 63 for three. However, captain Dinesh Karthik’s counter-attacking 58 off 29 balls and opener Gill’s 57 guided the side to a competitive total. Karthik, who has been struggling, brought up his half-century off just 22 balls. And it was the 82-run stand between him and Gill that set the tone for the Knights.

261,2020/10/10,Indian Premier League 2020 | Rajasthan looks to capitalise on Stokes’ probable return against Hyderabad,"The Royals will be relieved to have the services of Stokes who completes his mandatory quarantine on Saturday

Bruised and battered after a string of defeats, Rajasthan Royals will hope the presence of Ben Stokes gets the adrenaline flowing as they seek a revival of fortunes against a charged-up Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League on Sunday.

Rajasthan are struggling at the penultimate spot on the points table after two wins and four straight defeats, while Sunrisers have won three out of their six games so far and occupy the third position.

The Royals will be relieved to have the services of Stokes who completes his mandatory quarantine on Saturday. His absence has severely impacted the team’s campaign, as the inaugural season champions struggled to figure out their best combination.

Stokes had taken compassionate leave in the middle of England’s home Test series against Pakistan in August and travelled to New Zealand to attend to his father who had been diagnosed with brain cancer.

It was Stokes’ father who reminded the star all-rounder of his duty towards his job and that might be playing in the 29-year-old’s mind.

It is to be seen whether the World Cup winner, who has been out of action for some time now, is afforded the luxury of some practice or is played straight up.

“Stokes hasn’t had a lot of practice, he gets out of quarantine tomorrow, so we’ll see if he plays the day after tomorrow,” skipper Steve Smith had said after the match against Delhi Capitals.

Rajasthan, having lost to Delhi Capitals by a big margin of 46 runs, will look to stage a comeback.

An aggressive bowling display coupled with some good fielding saw them restrict Delhi Capitals to 184 for eight. However, the batsmen, save Yashasvi Jaiswal (34) and Rahul Tewatia (38), struggled during the chase.

The top guns — Jos Buttler, Smith and Sanju Samson — will again need to live up to the expectations by contributing in a big way.

Samson (176) and Smith (157) scored runs in their first two matches, twice taking the side past the 200-mark.

Rajasthan’s bowling is shouldered by pacer Jofra Archer and spinners Tewatia and Shreyas Gopal.

The Royals were off to a flying start, winning both their games at Sharjah but the former champions have since struggled to replicate those performances.

Having a slightly better season than their beleaguered opponents, Sunrisers were on their way to suffer back-to-back defeats before opener Jonny Bairstow and star spinner Rashid Khan helped them beat Kings XI Punjab by three wickets on Thursday.

For Sunrisers, Bairstow has been in prime form this season, smashing 97 off 55 balls against KXIP, and the English opener was at his explosive best against the Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore, too.

Skipper David Warner, who has scored 227 runs so far, would like to carry on with his good form after smashing 52 off 40 balls in the last match.

Manish Pandey and Kane Williamson are batsmen who can use the long handle to good effect while youngsters Priyam Garg, Abdul Samad and Abhishek Sharma are trying to carve a niche for themselves.

Despite losing senior pacers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and all-rounder Mitchell Marsh to injuries, Sunrisers have shown tremendous fighting abilities with the world’s top-ranked T20 bowler Rashid and yorker specialist T Natarajan dishing out splendid performances.

Teams (from):

Sunrisers Hyderabad: David Warner (c), Jonny Bairstow, Kane Williamson, Manish Pandey, Shreevats Goswami, Virat Singh, Priyam Garg, Wriddhiman Saha, Abdul Samad, Vijay Shankar, Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan, Jason Holder, Abhishek Sharma, B Sandeep, Sanjay Yadav, Fabian Allen, Prithvi Raj Yarra, Khaleel Ahmed, Sandeep Sharma, Shahbaz Nadeem, Siddharth Kaul, Billy Stanlake, T Natarajan, Basil Thampi.

262,2020/10/10,Indian Premier League 2020 | Mumbai Indians and Delhi capitals face off in battle of equals,"Be it a potent top-order, a strong middle-order or a lethal bowling attack, there is hardly anything that separates the two sides

Many small battles are expected to unfold when the season’s two most consistent teams — Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals — cross swords in a clash of equals in the Indian Premier League here on Sunday.

Be it a potent top-order, a strong middle-order or a lethal bowling attack, there is hardly anything that separates the two sides.

If at all one team has a slight upper hand in any department, it’s the experience in Mumbai Indians’ pace bowling arsenal. Both Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult, with years of experience behind them, could be the difference in the most sought-after contest of this edition.

It means that Shikhar Dhawan will have to strive harder to give the Capitals a solid start. The left-handed batsman has got starts in the last few games but needs a bigger innings under his belt and if it comes in a big contest, Capitals will have gained a lot.

In a way, young Prithvi Shaw and the in-form Rishabh Pant will face their first stiff test when they face Bumrah and Boult, who can trouble any batsman with their pace and accuracy.

The good news for Capitals is Shimron Hetmyer getting his touch back with the innings against Rajasthan Royals on Friday. He seemed to be the only weak link in Capitals’ ranks but his six-laden knock against Royals has removed that worry.

Capitals’ skipper Shreyas Iyer has been very impressive so far both as a batsman and as the leader of the pack. It will be interesting to see how he uses his resources against his in-form counterpart Rohit Sharma and his smashing middle-order due of Hardik Pandya and Kieron Pollard.

They can change the complexion of the game within minutes and handling them will be the key. Krunal Pandya, too, is capable of conjuring up cameos that can turn things around for Mumbai Indians.

Iyer has the exciting South African pace duo of Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortze to do the job in that department. The guile of Ravichandran Ashwin further adds sting to Capitals’ attack.

Axar Patel has nicely settled into the side after he replaced the injured Amit Mishra. His all-round ability is another plus for the Capitals.

At the big Abu Dhabi ground, a score in the vicinity of 170 is normally par for any other side in the IPL, but for Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals, even 200 may not appear safe.

Teams (from):

Delhi Capitals: Shreyas Iyer (c), Ravichandran Ashwin, Shikhar Dhawan, Prithvi Shaw, Shimron Hetmyer, Kagiso Rabada, Ajinkya Rahane, Amit Mishra, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ishant Sharma, Axar Patel, Sandeep Lamichhane, Keemo Paul, Daniel Sams, Mohit Sharma, Anrich Nortje, Alex Carey (wk), Avesh Khan, Tushar Deshpande, Harshal Patel, Marcus Stoinis, Lalit Yadav.

Mumbai Indians: Rohit Sharma (c), Aditya Tare, Anmolpreet Singh, Anukul Roy, Chris Lynn, Dhawal Kulkarni, Digvijay Deshmukh, Hardik Pandya, Ishan Kishan, James Pattison, Jasprit Bumrah, Jayant Yadav, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Mitchell McClenaghan, Mohsin Khan, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Prince Balwant Rai, Quinton De Kock, Rahul Chahar, Saurabh Tiwary, Sherfane Rutherford, Suryakumar Yadav, Trent Boult.

263,2020/10/10,IPL 2020 | We thought it was an under-par score but the wicket behaved differently: Shreyas Iyer,"Rajasthan Royals skipper Steven Smith too said that the wicket behaved differently from the two games they played here and won.

Delhi Capitals captain Shreyas Iyer said he thought his team had put up a below-par total against Rajasthan Royals but the Sharjah wicket, known for producing bagful of runs, was on the slower side and that worked in their favour on Friday.

Delhi posted the season’s lowest first innings total at this ground, making 184 for eight after being put in to bat.

However, the Royals ended up well short at 138 in 19.4 overs to suffer a 46-run loss.

“I’m really happy with the way we came out in the second innings. We thought it was an under-par score but it was stopping on the wicket and the bowlers executed their plans really well,” said Iyer at the post-match presentation.

“We were also going to bowl first with the dew factor, but thankfully it went in our favour.”

Delhi are sitting pretty at the top of the points table with five wins in six games.

Talking about the campaign so far, Iyer said: “I am enjoying captaincy because the players make it really easy, especially the bowlers. Even the way the support staff is managing the team meetings is commendable. I think the mixture in our team is really good and we have worked really hard on this.

“The boys have shared their thoughts pre-tour and their strengths and weaknesses. I am happy with how we are progressing and hoping to maintain the momentum.”

Royals skipper Steven Smith too said that the wicket behaved differently from the two games they played here and won.

“We are not playing good enough over the 40 overs, and not executing when the pressure is coming on and you can’t win many games that way,” Smith said after Royals suffered their fourth successive loss in the competition.

“The bowlers did a good job, and I don’t think the wicket was as good as it has been here, a bit stoppy tonight, and we gave away 10-15 extra runs.

“We have to remain positive, turn things around quickly. At the moment it doesn’t seem to be going our way. I’m not batting too well either. I did feel good tonight with the bat but didn’t get hold of one that I feel like I should have.”

On their star player Ben Stokes, who is currently undergoing a six-day quarantine, Smith said: “Stokes hasn’t had a lot of practice, he gets out of quarantine tomorrow, so we’ll see if he plays the day after tomorrow.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/yrrub6/article32817286.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHARJAHKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ipl-2020-we-thought-it-was-an-under-par-score-but-the-wicket-behaved-differently-shreyas-iyer/article32817287.ece

265,2020/10/10,FICCI fined ₹20 lakh for violating dust control norms,"The Delhi government on Saturday imposed a fine of Rs 20 lakh on the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) for violating dust control norms at a demolition site on Tansen Marg here, according to an official order.

The commerce body has been told to deposit the environment compensation within 15 days, according to the order.

Directions have been issued not to carry out or restart any demolition activity without installing an anti-smog gun at the project site, it said.

“An undertaking to this effect should be submitted within 7 days. You should also take adequate measures to rectify the deficiencies observed during the inspection on October 9 and submit a compliance report within a week,” it said.

The Delhi Pollution Control Committee had earlier asked FICCI to stop work at the demolition site.

It is mandatory to install anti-smog guns at construction and demolition sites larger than 20,000 square meters, according to government guidelines.

There are 39 sites having 20,000 sqm of area in Delhi. Six of these sites do not have anti-smog guns and have been told to stop work, Environment Minister Gopal Rai had said on Friday.

Mr. Rai said serious violations were observed at the FICCI campus.

“The demolition waste is lying uncovered and there is no anti-smog gun. We have issued directions to stop work. If they still go ahead with it, legal and financial action will be taken against the contractor,” he had said.

“Similar action will be taken against contractors at large sites violating dust control norms despite several warnings.

The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Friday conducted an online meeting with residents of urban and rural villages here to discuss issues like water scarcity, unplanned construction and encroachment due to lack of regulations.

Preparing for MPD-2041

The meeting was held as part of a series of consultations that the urban body is holding pertaining to the preparation of the Master Plan for Delhi (MPD)– 2041.

“Many villages do not even have defined road networks either in the revenue records or in the master plan, making it difficult to get building permissions from civic bodies. Participants also suggested that integrated village development plans should be prepared for the Lal Dora areas or villages as local bodies have not prepared these plans,” the DDA said.

DDA officials added, “Issues were raised for improved connectivity, access to small shops, social amenities for local community and up-gradation of physical infrastructure.” Participants also raised issues pertaining to water scarcity, the urban body said. “They emphasised on the need to create water retention ponds within existing and new developments, increase unpaved areas and create rainwater storage pits along stormwater drains, which will help in improving the water table. Participants also raised concerns over the lack of parking and building safety that is emerging out of unplanned development and rapid densification of areas,” the statement read.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dda-and-residents-discuss-civic-issues-in-online-meet/article32817668.ece
270,2020/10/10,Family members of girl kill 18-year-old youth in Delhi,"Accused objected to the duo’s friendship as they belonged to different faiths: police

An 18-year-old youth was allegedly beaten to death by a girl’s family members, including her brother, who objected to their friendship, the police said on Friday.

The incident took place on Wednesday evening in north-west Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar, they said.

2 arrested, 3 apprehened

The girl’s brother and her relative have been arrested while three juveniles have been apprehended in connection with the incident.

The victim — Rahul Rajput — was pursuing his second-year BA from Delhi University’s School of Open Learning. He also tutored school students.

The girl’s family was against her friendship with Rahul as they belonged to different faiths, the police said.

On Wednesday evening, the victim got a call from an unknown person, asking to meet him at Nanda road to discuss his tuition classes. But, when he reached the spot, a group of five men, including her brother, physically assaulted him, a senior officer said.

They slapped and kicked him following which he sustained severe injuries. He was then rushed to a hospital where he died during treatment, the officer said.

“On Wednesday, we received a call at 11.59 p.m. from BJRM Hospital about a patient admitted in an unconscious condition. Rahul did not have any visible injuries. After the post-mortem, the doctor said rupturing of spleen led to his death,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (North-West) Vijayanta Arya.

Based on Rahul’s uncle’s statement, a case was registered under Sections 302 (Murder) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, she added.

In his complaint, he said his nephew and the girl knew each other for two years. They lived in the same locality but the girl’s parents, especially her brothers, were against their friendship.

“On Wednesday at 7 p.m., I got a call from my friend who informed us that four-five boys were beating up my nephew. When I reached the spot, I found that my nephew was being beaten brutally by the girl’s brothers and their accomplices... they slapped, punched and kicked him,” he wrote in his complaint.

At the crime spot, the accused told him that they do not like his nephew talking to their sister. The accused told him that they would kill Rahul if he does not stop meeting their sister.

After a lot of pleading, the group let Rahul go, his uncle said. Next, he rushed his nephew to a local clinic.

Later, Rahul was shifted to BJRM hospital for further treatment.

Officers deployed in area

The case is under investigation, the police said, adding that personnel has been deployed in the locality to avoid any tension between the families.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4odsj6/article32817662.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE09VICTIM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/family-members-of-girl-kill-18-year-old-youth-in-delhi/article32817663.ece
271,2020/10/10,BJP takes a jibe at AAP govt. over MSP on crops of Delhi farmers,"The Delhi government had announced that it would increase the MSP on crops of farmers by 50% and crores were spent on advertisement, but not a single rupee worth of crop has been purchased so far, the Opposition BJP alleged here on Friday.

West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma alleged that Delhi’s Ministers were saying they had written letters to the Central government, but not a single letter had been written by the Kejriwal government addressing the issue of the farmers.

“Delhi’s farmers go to Haryana to sell their crops because the Delhi government does not pay them according to the increased MSP. The Kejriwal government now remembers that the farmers of Delhi are not getting the benefit of the MSP Scheme,” Mr. Verma alleged.

Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, challenged Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to discuss the issue of farmers on media platforms or in any village with him.

Meanwhile, AAP national spokesperson Raghav Chadha said, “After AAP exposed the Centre’s apathy towards Delhi’s farmers, the BJP seems to be completely rattled... The Centre has not purchased a single grain from the farmers of Delhi in the last five years.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-takes-a-jibe-at-aap-govt-over-msp-on-crops-of-delhi-farmers/article32817367.ece
272,2020/10/10,AAP attacks civic bodies over health trade licence issue,"‘Corporations are against finishing licence raj’

AAP on Friday attacked the BJP-ruled municipal corporations for allegedly opposing the Delhi government’s decision to end the requirement of a ‘health trade license’ for hotels and restaurants.

Addressing a press conference, AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had told commissioners of the three BJP-ruled municipal corporations that ‘health trade licence’ from the corporations was no longer required.

“The BJP-ruled MCD has opposed the decision of the Delhi government to end the health trade licence. This shows that the corporations are against finishing the licence raj. The FSSAI wrote a letter on September 7 to the municipal corporations of Delhi, saying they check standards of food and safety of all hotels and restaurants, therefore, there is no need to issue separate certificates by MCDs,” Mr. Bharadwaj said.

He alleged that despite this, the BJP-ruled corporations harass the restaurant and hotel owners to take health trade licence and collect “huge bribes”. “The harassment of these owners must stop, but the BJP-ruled MCDs want to continue such harassment against the owners of restaurants and hotels,” the AAP leader said.

AAP MLA Somnath Bharti said that after efforts of Mr. Kejriwal, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), under the Central government, on Friday allotted land to rebuild a Ravidas Temple at Tughlakabad.

The temple in Tughlakabad was demolished by the DDA on August 10 following a Supreme Court order. “Today, an authority meeting of the DDA was held. Last authority meeting of the DDA was held on August 13, 2019. At that meeting, I observed that the DDA should consider giving the land back to the Guru Ravidas Samiti without any further delay. Today the DDA has handed over the 400 sqm forest area to the Guru Ravidas Temple Samiti.

275,2020/10/10,Woman tries to end life at police chief’s office in Gurugram,"‘She had earlier attempted it twice’

A 28-year-old woman tried to end her life at Police Commissioner’s office here on Thursday over a matrimonial dispute. She was booked under Section 309 (attempt to suicide) and 190 (threat of injury to induce person to refrain from applying for protection to public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested.

Assistant Commissioner of Police, Headquarters, Usha Kundu, said the woman had tried to end her life on two more occasions earlier and also got rape cases registered against her husband and a doctor in different police stations in Gurugram.

A rape case was registered against her husband at Sector 51 Women Police Station on October 3. Her complaint came two days after her husband approached New Colony Police Station saying that the woman had married him without being legally divorced from her previous husband. He also accused her of “mentally” and “physically” harassing him and alleged that she had been demanding ₹10 lakh from him. Both the matters are under investigation.

Meanwhile, the woman reached the Police Commissioner’s office and tried to take her life, but was overpowered, said Gurugram Police spokesperson Subhash Boken.

The woman had come in contact with her present husband online during the lockdown while searching for the job of a patient care-taker. The two got married at a temple on September 2.

“The woman shifted to Gurugram to stay with her husband after the marriage, but the couple was held fighting at public places in two different police station areas. On one occasion, the traffic police personnel found them squabbling on the road. However, they told the police that they were a couple and were let off,” said Mr. Boken.In February, the woman had tried to end her life and got a rape case registered against a doctor at DLF Phase-III police station. “The doctor was arrested and later released on bail,” said Ms. Kundu.

In August, she again tried to take her life and got a case registered against her husband at Kotla Mubarakpur Police Station in Delhi. However, the matter was settled after the man agreed to marry her.

Her divorce case with her previous husband has been pending in Allahabad HC since 2017, said Mr. Boken.

Ms. Kundu said the woman would be counselled given the fact that she has tried to end her life on at least three occasions.

276,2020/10/10,Court rejects PIL claiming EPF Act not being followed while enrolling members,"The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed a PIL which claimed that the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act of 1952 and the schemes framed under it were not being followed while enrolling members.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan declined to entertain the plea, which had alleged that ineligible persons were being enrolled as members in the EPF schemes resulting in “major losses” to the Central government and the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO).

The petitioner, an Accounts officer in EPFO, said that certain employees contributing to the provident fund and availing income tax benefits withdraw money from their PF accounts on grounds of illness as no document is necessary for such advances and when they leave the service, the balance in their account is “so meagre” that there is no tax liability.

“This also results in huge loss of government revenue by evading Income Tax provisions,” the petition by Shovan Patra had alleged.

The plea had also alleged that “in order to save tax and other benefits, employers enrol their old relatives or even themselves as PF members on full pay though they are not eligible for PF membership.

“As there is no age limit for enrolment under PF, they keep on contributing to the fund till their death and are able to get tax-free benefits under EPF schemes and also additional Employees Deposit Linked Insurance scheme of ₹6 lakh,” it said.

The petition had sought directions to the Centre to modify the existing EPFO software, in accordance with the provisions of the 1952 Act and the schemes framed thereunder, “so that only eligible employees of the covered establishments may be enrolled as members”.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/court-rejects-pil-claiming-epf-act-not-being-followed-while-enrolling-members/article32817228.ece
277,2020/10/10,"Analysis | Amid farmer protests, BJP ally JJP in a dilemma as calls for Haryana Dy. CM’s resignation mount","Protests by farmers in Haryana and Punjab over the three controversial farm legislations, marked by road blockades and sporadic incidents of clashes with the police, show no signs of abating. Though both the ruling Congress party and the Opposition Shiromani Akali Dal have come in support of the agitating farmers in the neighbouring Punjab, Jannayak Janta Party, the junior partner in the BJP-led coalition government in Haryana, continues to be at the receiving end of the Opposition and farmers’ ire in the State for supporting the legislations.

In a bid to mount pressure on JJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala to step down, seventeen farmers’ unions in Haryana, under the aegis of All India Kisan Sangarsh Co-ordination Committee, tried to lay siege to his residence in Sirsa on Tuesday. It led to a clash with the police, which lobbed teargas shells and water cannons to disperse the protesters. A day later, several farmers’ leaders, including Swaraj India national president Yogendra Yadav, were detained and later released.

Unlike SAD that parted ways with the National Democratic Alliance on the matter, Mr. Chautala, who claims the legacy of Chaudhary Devi Lal, one of the country’s biggest farmers leaders, continues to resist the pressure to step down.

Caught in a dilemma

Though the JJP rejects the protests and the clamour for Mr. Chautala’s resignation as “politically motivated” and aimed at “destabilising the coalition government”, head of Political Science Department of Maharishi Dayanand University, Prof. Rajendra Sharma argues that it is a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea for the party.

“Since Chaudhary Devi Lal fought Congress all his life, forming a government with them is out of question for the JJP if it decides to pull out of the coalition. In that event, there is a possibility of a large chunk of party MLAs quitting JJP to support the BJP. Even if JJP manages to hold his flock together, the BJP can continue to run government with the support of the Independents, especially with the party being in power at the Centre as well,” says Prof. Sharma. He adds that, therefore, it makes more political sense for the JJP to continue in the coalition and remain politically relevant.

Political climate

The JJP’s decision to enter into a post-poll alliance with the BJP, despite campaigning against it during the polls, was seemingly guided by a similar political compulsion. Also, the JJP insiders believe that unlike SAD, which needs to face elections in over a year, the Haryana Assembly elections are four years away and the party could afford to wait-and-watch. JJP spokesperson Deep Kamal Saharan says that the farm legislations are indeed “progressive” and the party hopes the protests to fizzle out gradually with the farmers reaping the benefits of the laws.

Political observers and local leaders differ on the possible political repercussions for the JJP for its pro-legislations stand. Haryana Kisan Sabha vice-president, Inderjit Singh, believes that the decisions of the JJP to first support BJP in government formation and now support the farm legislations have angered its core vote bank comprising Jats and farmers. He says the two decisions have the potential to push the party into political oblivion. “A young leader like Mr. Chautala should think long term,” opines Mr. Singh.

However, former Haryana Agriculture University professor and political analyst Ram Kanwar says the three farm legislations herald a new era of freedom for the farmers and the JJP could actually benefit in the long run by supporting these laws.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/p2ew45/article32817226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL09-CHAUTALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/amid-farmers-protests-a-political-subplot-is-brewing/article32817227.ece

As many as 2,860 new COVID-19 cases were reported in Delhi in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 3,03,693, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Friday. Moreover, 39 more deaths have been reported, taking the total number of deaths to 5,692.

Of the total cases, 2,76,046, people have recovered and there are 21,955 active cases. The number of new cases has been less than 3,000 for the past eight days, but the number of daily tests which was above 60,000 in mid-September was only 48,692 on an average during these eight days.

As per Friday’s bulletin, the number of active cases, people in hospitals, and people under home isolation have decreased compared to Thursday.

Out of the total 15,833 beds available for COVID-19 treatment in the city, 66.9% are vacant as per government data. But 55.06% of the ICU beds with ventilators and 57.6% of the ICU beds without ventilators are full.

The positivity rate (percentage of people testing positive for every 100 tests done) was 5.8%, which is lower than September. The overall positivity rate till now is 8.6%. The number of containment zones in the city is 2,727.

Likely surge

Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said that a report by an expert committee has directed Delhi to prepare for a surge of 15,000 daily COVID-19 cases and said that they will implement the suggestions given by the committee.

“It has been said [in the report] that there could be 15,000 cases a day. We have to look at it, the last 15 days trend has been decreasing. We have around 16,000 beds and the occupancy is around 40%. Even if cases increase a little we can handle. If we have to increase [beds], we will,” he said.

On Thursday, The Hindu had reported that the report, which is yet to be made public, said that the Capital should prepare for a surge of 15,000 COVID-19 cases a day during winter months and patients may come from outside Delhi in “large numbers”.

The proposal to notify the amendment to the existing master plan was made in a meeting chaired by L-G Anil Baijal, who is also the DDA Chairman.

The urban body in a statement said: “Various representations from the Drugs Control Department as well as chemist and distribution authorities were received regarding grant or renewal of drug sale licenses in residential plots or flats. Accordingly, the authority recommended the inclusion of stockists and dealers of medicines and drugs in mixed use regulations in MPD 2021.” This will now be sent to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs for issuance of notifications.

Adoption of parks

In a bid to promote greenery in the Capital, the land-owning agency also approved a proposal by which public sector undertaking, authorities or boards constituted under the government and RWAs can adopt parks of any size instead of the minimum 3 acre parks, which was the norm earlier.

“The park would be available for adoption initially for three years, after which adoption may be extended further in instalments of three years with DDA’s approval up to a maximum period of 12 years or till it is under the jurisdiction of DDA, in case of handing over of the park to local authorities, whichever is earlier,” the urban body said.

Land for Ravidas Temple

The authority also approved allotment of 400 square metres of land for Guru Ravidas Temple in Jahapanah city forest for further process like approval from the forest department for dereservation and so on.

“As an exception in this case, the authority dispensed with the ‘auction’ as the only mode of land allotment. Further, to facilitate allotment, change of land use of said land from recreational to public & semi-public for religious purpose was also recommended.

281,2020/10/10,Delhi Cabinet gives nod for ‘Tree Transplantation Policy’,"Delhi is the first State in India to pass this policy, says CM

The Delhi Cabinet at a meeting on Friday approved the ‘Tree Transplantation Policy’ for the preservation of trees in the Capital. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Cabinet also gave its nod for the installation of the second smog tower in the world at Connaught Place within ten months.

A minimum of 80% of trees affected by a development or construction project will be transplanted and as much 80% of the transplanted trees must survive after transplantation, he said.

Mr. Kejriwal also said that the Delhi government will form a panel of agencies for tree transplantation and the government departments concerned will contact these agencies.

“A few days back, the people of Delhi started a huge movement, ‘Yuddh, Pradushan Ke Viruddh’, against the air pollution levels. Various measures will be taken under this, including EV, tree transplantation, and preventing stubble burning. One of the key components of this campaign was the tree transplantation policy,” Mr. Kejriwal said at a digital briefing.

Save and preserve

The woodland of Delhi is very dense and the trees are old and strong because Delhi is quite an old city and the government constantly tries to save and preserve trees but often due to construction and development work trees are cut down, Mr. Kejriwal said.

Until now, he said, the policy entailed planting 10 saplings as a compensatory effort if one tree was supposed to be cut. The tree which was cut could be around 400-500 years old and a symbol of how nature preserved it and nurtured it for so many years and was different from newly planted saplings.

“We have passed the tree transplantation policy. Delhi is the first State in the country where this policy has been passed. Along with retaining the policy of planting 10 saplings for every one tree that is cut, we can transplant trees additionally. The process involves uprooting a tree from a particular spot, lifting it, and planting it at another spot,” the Chief Minister said.

A minimum of 80% of trees affected by a project, he said, over and above compensatory afforestation of planting of 10 saplings, will be transplanted. Also, a minimum of 80% of the transplanted trees should survive and ensuring this would be the responsibility of the agencies that will take permission from us.

The Delhi government will also form a panel of the agencies that excel in the task of transplantation and whichever department wants trees to be transplanted can approach any agency out of the panel that is being formed. The payment of the agencies will be made only if 80% of the trees continue to survive after a year, the Chief Minister said.

Transplantation cell

A dedicated Tree Transplantation Cell will also be formed by the Delhi government and local committees, which will include government officials, citizens, RWAs to monitor the transplanted trees and to certify that the task has been done with due diligence.

“A smog tower will also be installed in Delhi that will be the second smog tower in the world. The first smog tower in the world was set up in China. Two smog towers are being installed in Delhi, out of which one will be done by the Centre at Anand Vihar and the second by the Delhi government at Connaught Place,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

The technology used in the smog tower installed by the Delhi government, he said, is different from the technology used in China. In China, the smog tower sucks the polluted air from below and releases clean air from above.

“Our smog tower will suck the polluted air from above and release clean air from the bottom. The Delhi Cabinet has sanctioned ₹20 crore for the installation of this first-of-its-kind smog tower, and we hope that the installation work will be completed within the next 10 months. We are calling it a pilot project for now, and if it is successful, many more smog towers will be installed across Delhi,” the Chief Minister also said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/j5cgit/article32819260.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE10CMlt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-cabinet-gives-nod-for-tree-transplantation-policy/article32817172.ece
282,2020/10/10,Three held for swindling ₹10 cr. funds,"Accused availed term loans, didn’t repay it and sold units mortgaged

Three men were arrested for allegedly misappropriating funds of a company to the tune of ₹10 crore, police said on Friday.

The accused — Pramod Goel, Krishan Chand Bansal and Anil Gupta — were directors of M/S Indirapuram Habitat Centre Pvt. Ltd. They have been arrested and sent to judicial custody, police said.

A case was registered against them under section 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC on a complaint by a private company. It alleged that in 2016, the accused company had availed term loans of ₹10 crore from them for a period of two years for the completion of its project but failed to repay it and defrauded them, the police said.

Joint Commissioner of Police (Economic Offences Wing) Dr. O.P. Mishra said that during investigation, it was found that the accused had availed a term loan of ₹10 crore from the complainant company for a period of two years. But they did not repay the loan and sold the units mortgaged to the complainant company. Investigation with regard to bank statements also revealed that the amount has been misappropriated, he said.

“It also emerged that the units mortgaged as collateral security have been sold to other investors after taking full payments from them. Accused company also offered them assured return on their investment but no return was paid as promised. In a calculative manner, the accused company not only cheated the complainant company but also cheated the investors,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/three-held-for-swindling-10-cr-funds/article32817155.ece

The air quality of Delhi continued to be in the “poor” category on Friday and is expected to improve to “moderate” category on Sunday, according to SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research), a government-run monitoring agency.

Also, Environment Minister Gopal Rai visited construction and demolition works at Pragati Maidan and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) and said that the latter has not installed an anti-smog gun and work will be allowed to restart only after installing one. All large construction sites need to install anti-smog gun to control air pollution as per rules.

“The Delhi government has identified 39 sites with more than 20,000 sq meter areas. Out of these, 33 sites have installed anti-smog guns but six sites have not. No relaxation will be permitted to anyone if found to spread pollution, the government’s guidelines have to be strictly followed,” Mr. Rai said.

The AQI (Air quality Index) of the city was 202 on Friday, slightly down from 208 a day ago, as per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. On Wednesday, the air quality of the city had turned poor after more than three months of better air and has remained in the same levels since then.

“AQI is forecast to stay at the higher end of moderate to the poor category for Saturday, further AQI is forecast to improve by October 11, but in the moderate category,” SAFAR said in a statement.

Positive influence

The agency further said that a shift in surface wind direction is predicted in Delhi from north-westerly to south-easterly by October 12 and this could have a positive influence on air quality in the next week.

“We wonder whether the functionaries or their superiors are oblivious of the Hon’ble Supreme Court judgment on the issue of Aadhaar number and its uses. A careful reading of the judgment makes the reader wise to desist from obtaining Aadhar details unless there is a quid pro quo between the State and the citizen,” an excerpt from the email reads.

They also sought to know why in the TS NPB Dharani Enlistment form, the government requires property owners to furnish details of how a property was acquired.

Speaking to The Hindu, both Mr Vivek and Mr Reddy said that the government should clarify on the aspects on which the email touches upon. “What is the reason for asking Aadhaar details?

“We are clear about this. Why does the government want so many details, including the number of people in our houses and their Aadhaar card numbers? They already took details in the intensive household survey soon after the creation of Telangana. There was fear over NPR in the country a few months ago. Why is this exercise soon after,” he said.

In a statement issued to the media, Jamiat president Maulana Hafiz Peer Shabbir said that the organisation had a membership of over 6 lakh and instructions had been given to them to seek clarifications once government officials come with the enlistment forms. “They have been told not to give information to them till clarifications come forth. Otherwise they will boycott this drive,” he said, adding that the decision to boycott TS NPB was taken once it was announced.

Another cleric, Maulana Jafar Pasha, too raised similar concerns.

On the other hand, the Jamiat-e-Ulama Hind of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh (Arshad Madani group) decided to support the Telangana government’s move. Speaking to The Hindu, Jamiat general secretary Mufti Mahmood Zubair said, “We believe that this is not connected to NPR and NRC. Therefore, we have decided to ask people to participate in the property enrolment. This will straighten out a lot of creases which property owners have been facing over long periods. A lot of property owners can benefit from this.”

Meanwhile, the Jamat-e-Islami Hind of Telangana and Odisha is ‘studying’ the issue. Speaking to The Hindu, Jamaat president Hamed Mohammed Khan said, “We want to be thorough about what Dharani is, and also about the land laws. We are speaking to bureaucrats, former civil servants, and lawyers. We are likely to make our stand clear on Monday,” he said.

In a separate development, a widely-shared video clip showed an unidentified resident turning away personnel carrying enrolment forms and wearing GHMC caps and vests.

In the video, he is heard questioning the authenticity of forms which, he says, do not carry a government seal. “Why do you want Aadhaar details? You have house numbers and that is sufficient,” he is heard asking why details of children are required. It is not clear where the incident took place.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/muslim-bodies-divided-on-dharani/article32823569.ece
286,2020/10/10,Singareni Seva Samithi stall in Uppal Shilparamam,"A stall of Singareni Seva Samithi, community development arm of the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd (SCCL), was opened at the new Shilparama complex at Uppal here on Saturday for display and sale of products made by self-help groups promoted by the Seva Samithi.

The stall was inaugurated by General Manager (Community Development) and vice-president of the Seva Samithi K. Ravi Shanker.

Speaking on the occasion, he said the stall was opened to enable women trained in various handicrafts by the Seva Samithi to sell the products made by their self-employment units across the Singareni Collieries in the State Capital.

He hoped that the stall would provide improved marketing to the products of SHGs and the expenditure incurred in maintaining the stall would be borne by the Seva Samithi itself. He suggested the women to improve their business by following COVID norms and also by producing the quality products that have good demand.

Stating that the Shilparamam at Uppal is mostly visited by the middle-class and lower-middle class families, Mr. Ravi Shanker asked the SHGs of Seva Samithi to produce the products keeping in mind such customers with competitive pricing. Self-employment unit organisers Rajitha, Satyavathi and Saritha thanked the management of Singareni for training them in making of handicrafts and also for providing marketing facility by setting up stall in Hyderabad.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/k3dezv/article32823544.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy11singareni,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/singareni-seva-samithi-stall-in-uppal-shilparamam/article32823545.ece
287,2020/10/10,KCR has hidden agenda behind one-day Assembly session: Bandi Sanjay,"Telangana BJP State president Bandi Sanjay on Saturday alleged that TRS government is holding one-day Assembly session to curry favour to Muslims and MIM party.

In a scathing attack on TRS supremo and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhara Rao, the BJP State president said the one-day session was planned to relax the rule of not permitting persons having more than two children to contest in GHMC elections.

Speaking with media persons at Kondagattu in Jagityal district, having returned from Delhi, Mr. Sanjay said the one-day Assembly session is purely to help TRS party’s ally MIM in ensuing GHMC elections by relaxing the two-child norm. He charged that Mr. Rao had already damaged the interests of lakhs of Backward Classes among Hindus by providing 12% reservations to Muslims.

To exploit the Muslim vote bank in GHMC elections, Mr. Rao decided to permit persons having more than two children to contest in GHMC elections, Mr. Sanjay charged. Relaxation of two-child norm would help Muslims who have more than two children and directly benefit MIM, the BJP president alleged.

Continuing the tirade against Mr. Rao, the Karimnagar MP said the TRS supremo did not utter a single word about the law brought out by the BJP against on Triple Talaq which is helping Muslim women. He would does not speak about 12% reservations for tribals but readily holds Assembly session to help Muslims, Mr. Sanjay alleged.

“When KCR made sarcastic comments about Hindus during Lok Sabha elections, people taught him a lesson in Karimnagar. People would repeat it in GHMC polls if he undermines majority sections,” the BJP president said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kcr-has-hidden-agenda-behind-one-day-assembly-session-bandi-sanjay/article32823309.ece
288,2020/10/10,Property enumeration sluggish in city,"Out of 24.5 lakh properties, only 14.5 lakh are on GHMC records

Enumeration of properties within the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation limits for uploading onto the Dharani portal could take much longer than expected, going by the experience so far.

Despite enlisting the services of thousands of GHMC employees, the survey in the city is proceeding at tardy pace, sources informed. Going by the progress, it could take up to two months’ time for completion of the survey.

Government has roped in more than 5,000 employees from the corporation’s various wings -- including Sanitation, Entomology, Town Planning, Revenue, and Engineering, for carrying out the property enumeration.

Reports came in that staff of the cadres ranging from data entry operators up to assistant engineers from the head quarters too have been asked to report to the zonal offices for one week, to be part of the field survey, while higher ranking officials have been deployed to monitor the mammoth task.

Despite the best of the efforts, the enumeration has been sluggish so far, and it is not yet clear if the employees would be retained on the duty for longer than a week’s time.

Estimates are that there could be around 24.5 lakh properties in the city, of which only 14.5 lakh properties are on the GHMC records.

Only about three lakh properties have been enumerated for the first 10 days, up to Saturday, though the employees have been made to work even on holidays.

Officials say that about 7% to 8% of the enumerated properties are new, as in they have not entered the property tax records so far.

Staff on the ground are facing issues ranging from suspicious property owners to technical glitches. On an average, about 30% of the employees are unable to log in due to software issues, sources informed.

Besides, the kind of details sought in the prescribed format, including Aadhaar number, caste, and details of family members are giving rise to suspicion that this exercise is linked to National Population Register (NPR)/ National Register of Citizens (NRC) by the Central government.

Staff roughed up

“We are facing tough situation in the old city, as people are not ready to trust us. A predominant majority have refused to part with the details, and a few employees on the duty have also been roughed up,” shared an employee.

The situation has only improved during the last two days, after corporators of the respective divisions have been taken into confidence to spread awareness and gain trust.

All pervasive scare of COVID-19 pandemic too is proving to be a hindrance. Resident welfare associations of several apartment complexes and gated communities have barred entry for the teams due to apprehensions about spread of the disease.

“Some of them, especially from gated communities, said they will upload the details online by themselves. We could convince a few, but majority of them would not budge,” said an official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/property-enumeration-sluggish-in-city/article32823267.ece
289,2020/10/10,"FGG moves HC, seeks special Task Force for cases against MsP, MsLA","Court asked to instruct govt. to appoint PP, staff to try these cases

Forum for Good Governance (FGG) has filed a PIL petition in Telangana High Court seeking a direction to the State government for constitution of a special Task Force for completion of trial of all criminal cases against MsP and MsLA within a year.

A voluntary organisation, FGG asked the court to instruct the government to appoint a public prosecutor and staff members to the Special Court to try cases against MsP and MsLA. It also wanted the government to update the HC about the progress in the trial of these criminal cases every month.

‘Inaction illegal’

Seeking to declare inaction of the government on the matter as illegal, the petitioner requested the court to direct the government to initiate immediate steps for completion of trial of all criminal cases involving MsP and MsLA.

Stressing the need for constitution of a special Task Force, FGG secretary M. Padmanabha Reddy said in the petition that seven criminal cases were pending against seven Ministers of Telangana Cabinet and the Chief Minister.

In majority of the cases, the Station House Officer who is supposed to investigate the cases would be working at the pleasure of the local MLA or Minister, the petitioner said. Under such circumstances, the investigators would tend to drag the cases and would not take interest in successful prosecution of the case against the public representative concerned.

In this backdrop, a special Task Force on the lines of an agency like Anti-Corruption Bureau was the need of the hour to probe such cases, the petitioner contended. It was stated in the plea that not all cases registered against MsP and MsLA were transferred to the Special Court.

300 cases

While there were more than 300 cases against public representatives (133 involving MsP and 150 cases involving MsLA), only 118 were transferred to the Special Court. The plea is likely to come up for hearing next week.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fgg-moves-hc-seeks-special-task-force-for-cases-against-msp-msla/article32818942.ece
290,2020/10/10,Petition on Varma’s movie on ‘Disha encounter’ release closed,"Justice P. Naveen Kumar of Telangana High Court on Friday closed a writ petition filed by the father of victim in Disha case seeking to stop the release of a film made by Ram Gopal Varma on the sexual assault and murder of his daguther.

The petitioner’s daughter, a veterinarian, was violated by a quartet of youngsters before brutally killing her and torching her body in Shadnagar on Hyderabad outskirts in November last year. Subsequently, the Cyberabad police arrested the four accused. They were killed in an exchange of fire with the police when they allegedly tried to flee after being taken to the crime scene for reconstruction of crime.

The victim’s father stated in his petition that it was not proper to make a film on her when the case was still being inquired into by a judicial commission constituted by the Supreme Court. He requested the court to pass instructions restraining the director from releasing the movie on this November 26 as already announced by him.

Justice P. Naveen Rao sought to know from the Assistant Solicitor General Namavarapu Rajeshwara Rao what was the stand of the authorities and the Censor Board on the matter. A lawyer attached to ASG’s office informed the court that the officials and the Censor Board authorities did not receive any representation from any person raising objection over making the film on Disha’s case.

The judge disposed of the petition asking the authorities to resolve expeditiously if an application was received raising objection over the film.

291,2020/10/10,No rush in Metro trains,"Passenger count slowly rising as per expectation

It’s been a month since Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) has commenced operations after a gap of five and a half months due to the COVID-19 pandemic and passengers gingerly stepping into the three-coach trains has reached about 80,000 in all the three corridors.

“We have been expecting passengers’ count to rise gradually and the numbers are as per our expectation. By and large, citizens have been disciplined in adhering to the safety protocols of mandatory face masks, physical distancing and personal hygiene at the stations and inside the trains too,” said managing director N.V.S. Reddy.

Corridor One or the Red Line - L.B. Nagar to Miyapur has about 48,000 passengers daily, the second corridor or the Green Line - Jubilee Bus Station to MGBS (Imlibun) is seeing about 4,000 passengers and the third corridor of Blue Line - Nagole to Raidurg is carrying about 28,000 passengers. Everyday, 51 trains are making about 750 trips with frequency between five and seven minutes depending on the rush from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.

The MD stated that save for a few groups of youngsters seen removing their face masks and congregating inside the trains, it has been a relatively smooth affair. “Our staff have been politely telling such passengers to keep the masks on. So far, we have not taken any action because it is clear most citizens are conscious of potential virus spread of the raging pandemic and are following the safety protocols diligently,” maintained Mr. Reddy.

Metro Rail authorities started commercial operations with a new set of rules of thermal screening of passengers at entry level, hand sanitation stands, making face masks compulsory and social distancing marking done inside stations and trains - standing and seating too. Before the lockdown HMR was carrying close to five lakh passengers a day with most passengers travelling towards the IT/ITES corridors on the Blue Line towards Hi-Tec City and Raidurg.

“Till the IT/ITES employees start travelling to their respective offices, we are not expecting a surge in passenger travel. In any case, we are having the second highest passenger count in Metro rail travel across the country with Delhi Metro carrying seven lakh passengers a day as against the pre-lockdown of 26 lakh. However, we are not yet witnessing rush during the peak hours as is being witnessed in the national capital where passengers are being urged to stagger their travel timing,” explained the MD.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/no-rush-in-metro-trains/article32816989.ece

294,2020/10/10,"Carvaan Malayalam is fine-tuned for Malayali music lovers, says Saregama India MD Vikram Mehra","Carvaan Malayalam, which was recently launched, has 5,000 pre-loaded tracks for offline listening

After music label Saregama's portable digital audio player Carvaan made its mark in other languages such as Hindi and Tamil, the company now gears up to be on song in Malayalam as well. With its trademark retro design, Carvaan Malayalam, which was launched recently, comes with 5,000 pre-loaded tracks from yore for seamless offline listening. Saregama India Managing Director Vikram Mehra tells us why their new radio-cum-music player promises a treat for music lovers in Malayalam.

What prompted Saregama to venture into Malayalam with its Carvaan series?

We received a great response both in Hindi-speaking regions and in South India. When it comes to the movies and the quality of music, there is a clear understanding that Malayalam has always done so well. The language is currently a focus area for us now. The way Carvaan's journey has been going, starting off with Hindi and then making a presence in other languages, Malayalam was obviously the next big step.

How were the tracks in the in-built playlist selected? What were the criteria?

We are invested in the big data, with innumerable data points spread around the world and across different media, such as streaming services, YouTube, radio stations and so on. Thus we source feedback from Saregama's content usage. This helps us track by language, by artist, to ascertain the most popular ones. This facility was utilised to a great extend in drawing the Malayalam playlist as well.

Carvaan Malayalam | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Some of the notable ones included...

Since the core idea of our system is tapping the nostalgia factor, the playlist ends roughly with the end of the 20th century. Carvaan Malayalam comes with 5,000 pre-loaded songs in which we have also included 1,000 select Hindi songs that were big hits and a host of chosen Carnatic compositions as well. This is a pattern we follow with Carvaan's regional variants. The oldest song is perhaps Omanathingal Kidavo from the 1950 film Sthree and the latest Changampuzha Kavithakal from the film Meghasandesham (2001). Other popular albums or film include Chemmeen, Pareeksha, Vishukkani, Madanolsavam, Avalude Ravukal.

So, in this digital age, how is Carvaan different from other music services, like YouTube and Spotify?

Carvaan's USP is convenience. I say it is perhaps less about music and more about the convenience of listening to music. There are some in the older age bracket who may be a bit uncomfortable with new technology. Sometimes it can get a bit complicated. This is no frills. Just press the button for your curated old is gold (songs). No repetition, no ad breaks and there is no need for an Internet connection either. Also, this is a product chiefly conceptualised on the nostalgia factor.

Any added features exclusive to Carvaan Malayalam?

We have not tinkered with our basic product. This version too has Bluetooth, Aux output and USB support and can be used simply also as a pair of high-end speakers. Then as we have done with our earlier products, FM/AM are added. So it doubles up as your pocket-sized radio as well. Otherwise, design-wise it is untouched.

Carvaan Malayalam is priced at ₹6,190.

296,2020/10/10,High Court rejects unaided colleges’ plea against CAP,"Govt, university argue institutions bound by pact to set apart 50% seats for merit admissions

The Kerala High Court has upheld the Mahatma Gandhi University’s decision to conduct the Centralised Allotment Process (CAP) for 50% of the seats in unaided arts and science colleges.

The court passed the judgment while dismissing a writ petition filed by the Kerala Arts and Science Unaided College Managements’ Association and others. According to them, there was no statutory provision enabling the university to take over the admission to unaided arts and science colleges. As a result of the CAP, even if seats were vacant in the 50% quota, the managements could not fill them.

The State government and the university submitted that CAP was used by all the universities in the State to enable students to apply at a single point for admission to undergraduate courses in any college under the university. CAP was introduced as the separate admission procedures adopted by individual colleges were found detrimental to the interests of the students. The setting apart of 50% of the seats was a condition for the grant of affiliation.

The court said that the inconvenience faced by the managements of unaided colleges affiliated to the university was not a sufficient ground to hold that CAP was illegal.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4pkyzi/article32412177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KERALAHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/court-rejects-unaided-colleges-plea-against-cap/article32817486.ece

Not prepared to be bogged down by the hurdles posed by the raging pandemic, the district Kudumbashree Mission is set to organise a week-long social fair, one of its flagship annual events, on multiple digital platforms from Saturday.

Organised by its 92 Gender Resource Centres, the event was introduced last year and was a resounding success. Among other things, it showcases the full array of products, services, and projects being run by Kudumbashree through its Neighbourhood Groups (NHGs).

“Rather than organising it as a social fair, this time around we have conceived it as social fair with social distancing by taking it to digital platforms.

298,2020/10/10,Thammanam-Pullepady stretch to be made a four-lane road,"PWD completes survey; report to be submitted to KIIFB for funding.

Aimed at augmenting the much-needed east-west road connectivity in the city, the PWD (Roads wing) has completed a survey to develop the narrow Thammanam-Pullepady Road as a four-lane road, and to extend it on either side towards MG Road and NH Bypass.

The road will be widened into a four-lane one having 22 metre width. A median, footpaths on either side and a duct to carry utility cables and pipelines are part of the project. The existing alignment will be altered wherever needed, while junctions will be widened as per KIIFB norms, to enable free-left turns. The survey report will be shortly finalised, said sources in the department.

The report will be forwarded to the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), following which a Detailed Project Report (DPR) will be readied. A few dozen land owners had surrendered land free of cost for the project, while land has to be acquired from the rest of the people. Currently, only two small stretches in the Katrikadavu-Karanakodam stretch are four lane. This was made possible by using ₹25 crore allotted by the UDF government.

A critical part of the survey, which was undertaken during the past few months, was to do soil testing at multiple points in order to widen/rebuild narrow bridges and culverts on the 4-km corridor which will link Padma Junction on MG Road with Chakkaraparambu on Palarivattom-Vyttila NH Bypass. The KIIFB had promised funding to implement the project that would considerably decongest SA Road and Banerjee Road, a senior PWD official said.

The four-lane road is expected to be completed latest by 2023. A two-lane bridge will be built parallel to the Pullepady overbridge.

At present, commuting through the narrow corridor is a nightmare due to its uneven width. Similarly, pedestrians have to risk their lives and walk through whatever little space is available on the edge of the road.

Even as the PWD did a survey of the stretch, it has not formally taken it over from the Kochi Corporation/Local Self Government Department, it is learnt.

Bund Road

In the meantime, the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) has not been able to widen a 100-metre stretch on Chilavannooor Bund Road that has been stifling movement of vehicles along the road that links Thykoodam on NH Bypass with Panampilly Nagar. “A couple of land owners on the stretch are unwilling to move over to alternative land which we showed them in Panampilly Nagar. We have identified land in another locale to rehabilitate them,” said V. Salim, chairman of the agency. The GCDA did not have funds to compensate them in cash, he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/uvlum7/article32817473.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08KI-THAMMANAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/thammanam-pullepady-stretch-to-be-made-a-four-lane-road/article32817474.ece

300,2020/10/10,Canal rejuvenation project nearing completion,"Reviving the 2-km-long Andhakarathodu in Thripunithura will help prevent flooding in the town and give boost to tourism.

A ₹10-crore initiative to rejuvenate the 2-km-long Andhakarathodu in Thripunithura and to build walkways on either side, is nearing completion.

The project to rejuvenate the water body which connects the Konothupuzha and Chambakkara canal, can be commissioned in three months, said sources in the Irrigation Department, which is executing the works.

The Andhakarathodu was built during the reign of kings in Kochi, mainly to transport cargo. Over the years, it fell into disuse and became a garbage dumping ground. This is the first KIIFB-funded project in Kerala and rejuvenation work began in 2018.

Apart from immense tourism potential, the project has a role in checking flooding in and around Thripunithura. Well over 50 per cent of the work is over, including cleaning and desilting of the waterbody. “Pre-cast piles and slabs have been cast at our yard in Muvattupuzha and will be fixed on either end of the water body. There was a few months’ delay due to the pandemic. We have directed the Thripunithura Municipality to close drainage pipes which pump household and other sewage into the canal. Most encroachers have been removed, while the rest will be removed in the coming weeks,” the Irrigation sources said.

Walkways

The project was entrusted to the Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation. Under this, 2-m and 3-m wide walkways are being built on either side of the waterbody. A pair of eight-foot-high fences will be erected to prevent dumping of waste. Ninety per cent of the fabrication of the fencing material is over.

A ₹1-crore project to install lights and to landscape the walkways will be tendered shortly. Most of the trees on either side have been retained while unwanted ones have been cut.

The walkways could well be used as joggimg tracks like the Marine Drive waterfront, they said.

Yet another project to rejuvenate the 18-km Konothupuzha is awaiting the government’s sanction. Its banks will be reinforced using geo-textiles, while low-lying bridges will be rebuilt in the second phase, it is learnt.

As many as 20 health workers were among the 911 persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Friday in the district.

The source of infection of 118 patients remains untraced, while 753 people have contracted it through local contact and 20 people who arrived from outside the State have tested positive. About 458 people tested negative on the day and 437 patients were discharged from hospitals and first-line treatment centres. A total of 29,777 people remain in quarantine in the district.

The district’s active caseload now stands at 12,409. A majority of people recovering from the infection remain in isolation at home. Around 8,818 people are in isolation at home, 217 patients are admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital, 53 patients are being treated at PVS Hospital, 78 at INHS Sanjivani, 874 patients are at private hospitals and 1487 at first-line treatment centres.

302,2020/10/10,Chottanikkara panchayat tops solid waste management rating in Ernakulam district,"27 panchayats, 5 municipalities found eligible for govt. certificate

Chottanikkara grama panchayat has topped the list of local bodies in Ernakulam in the assessment test on solid waste management conducted by the Department of Local Self-Government.

The local body earned 87 points out of 100. Twenty-seven panchayats and five municipalities won more than 60 marks and turned eligible for receiving certificates from the government for effective solid waste management.

However, only 32% of the panchayats in the district qualified the test. Eight municipalities also failed to make it to the list. The government had chalked out a 20-point criteria for evaluating the steps taken by local bodies for effective management of biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste generated within their limits.

Varapetti panchayat missed the top slot by one point and emerged runner-up with 86 points followed by Kunnukara (84 points). The top 10 panchayats included Nedumbassery (79); Pallippuram (77); Kalady (77); Kumbalanghi (77); Rayamangalam (72); Mulanthuruthy (72); Amballur (71); and Vadakkekara (71).

North Paravur topped the list of municipalities, with 93 points for implementing source-level treatment mechanisms and effective collection and storage of non-biodegradable waste. Eloor and Aluva shared the second place.

Interestingly, Aluva municipality figured among the five municipalities in Ernakulam pulled up by the State Pollution Control Board for non-compliance of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The authorities informed the appraisal committee that they had depended on Brahmapuram for biodegradable waste alone while claiming to have initiated steps for proper collection and segregation of non-biodegradable waste. Piravom and Kothamangalam municipalities earned 67 and 64 points respectively.

The criteria for evaluation included use of members of Haritha Karma Sena for collection of non-biodegradable waste; number of households handing over waste to the green volunteers; and families remitting user fee for collection of non-biodegradable waste at doorstep.

The evaluation also took into account the source-level treatment of biodegradable waste undertaken by the local bodies. The availability of material collection and resource recovery facilities for management of non-biodegradable waste was evaluated as part of the overall rating process. The evaluation committee checked whether the local bodies had set up public toilets. The presence of waste dumping yards and the quality of water resources in each civic body were also analysed.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/chottanikkara-panchayat-tops-solid-waste-management-rating-in-ernakulam-district/article32817393.ece
303,2020/10/10,Rise in use of plastic carry bags in Ernakulam,"Govt. had allowed use of disposable cups and plates in hotels as a precautionary measure against COVID-19

The relaxation of rules in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis has resulted in a spike in the use of single-use plastic carry bags and disposable materials in Ernakulam.

Green volunteers involved in the collection of non-biodegradable waste have reported an increase in the piling up of single-use plastic carry bags. The government had allowed the use of single-use disposable cups and plates in hotels and other places in place of reusable ones as a precautionary measure against COVID-19.

Estimates by the Haritha Keralam Mission revealed that the collection and storage of non-biodegradable waste was hit in many local bodies due to the restrictions imposed by the authorities.

People were using plastic carry bags instead of reusable ones while purchasing groceries. They prefer plastic bags and disposable containers as those can be incinerated after single use. But this will affect the environment as plastic piles have shot up considerably at various places, according to officials of the Department of Local Self-Government.

The enforcement agencies remain hesitant to clamp down on the use of single-use plastic products as it may invite opposition from traders and the public amidst the pandemic crisis. The inspection of shops and commercial establishments for violation of rules has come to a halt over the last five months.

The members of the Haritha Karma Sena are also witnessing opposition from a section of households while they visit the homes for collection of non-biodegradable waste. Many residents prefer burning waste materials at home instead of permitting the workers to enter their homes, fearing the possibility of contracting the disease. The green volunteers are also worried about collecting waste from containment zones in the district.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/rise-in-use-of-plastic-carry-bags-in-ernakulam/article32817376.ece
304,2020/10/10,Turning the spotlight on mental health during a pandemic,"Many share experience through District Child Protection Unit’s #sharemystress campaign

Could lemon juice help bust mental stress?

While it may not be backed by any scientific reasoning, lemon juice turned out to be one of the preferred ways to fight mental stress for a person who shared his experience through the District Child Protection Unit’s (DCPU) #sharemystress campaign, coinciding with World Mental Health Day on Saturday.

The campaign, under which the DCPU invited short one-minute videos on simple techniques to deal with mental stress, has thrown up several such interesting methods. Though drinking water, travelling, reading and doing yoga emerged among the numerous methods to fight mental stress, the most common outlet turned out to be sharing it with a close confidante.

“We came up with such a campaign since we could not organise events as we usually do to observe World Mental Health Day. The videos will be posted on the official Facebook page of DCPU,” said M.K.P. Hafzeena, project officer for non-institutional care, DCPU. The organisation may even explore the possibility of bringing out a compilation of selected videos.

The DCPU has been offering emotional succour through counselling ever since the outbreak of the pandemic and, going by the feedback, children are getting used to the changed world with online classes and being confined indoors.

Psychiatrist C.J. John said being restricted indoors posed emotional, mental and intellectual hurdles in the growth of children. “At the moment, we are only addressing the intellectual issues through online classes while the emotional and mental challenges go unaddressed,” he said.

Dr. John said that in a world ravaged by the pandemic, people needed to acquire “psychological first aid” skills to empower the community to identify those in mental distress, listen to them and enable them to access help. He said it would be in tune with the year’s World Mental Health Day observation that calls for ‘Mental Health for All - Greater Investment - Greater Access’.

“Unlike at the start of the pandemic, psychological stress emanating from secondary reasons triggered by the disease such as economic distress, job loss and confinement of children indoors is increasingly coming to the fore,” he said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/turning-the-spotlight-on-mental-health-during-a-pandemic/article32817095.ece

Pune-based Swatantra Theatre uses the lens of theatre to raise awareness on mental health. On World Mental Health Day on October 10, the group presents Common Sadness, a collaboration with Showroom MAMA, a visual arts and crafts centre. The Netherlands-based platform approached Swatantra to partner with them for a visual exhibition on Mental Illness. Directed by Swatantra’s Abhijeet Choudhary and performed by actors Dhanashree Heblikar, Durgeshwari Sharma Prithvi Sancheti and Shoham Gadkari, the film Common Sadness is written by the artists’ collective beyoncé (Netherlands)

The props assigned to the theatre group on mental illness were used artistically in a video shot at the main theatre of Film and Television Institute (FTII) Pune.

Then, on October 11, the theatre group’s documentary Suno Suno shows how theatre helped the migrant community to speak up on mental health. The community theatre play is based on a study conducted by De Montfort University, Leicester, Excavate Theatre London, Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) and Institute of Health Management (IHM) for 18 months.

“After 18 months of field work interacting with families and listening to their stories, we help the community put on a play about their stories and celebrating their lives. The underlying theme of drama was to show to the communities that seeking help from the people you trust, showing compassion and teamwork all make for better mental health,” says a spokesperson.

(Common Sadness and Suno Suno can be watched on Swatantra Theatre’s YouTube channel on October 10 and 11 from 6 pm onwards)",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/mzoeva/article32820026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym12play-new,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/pune-based-theatre-group-swatantra-theatre-releases-a-documentary-to-mark-world-mental-health-day-on-october-10/article32819980.ece
307,2020/10/10,Play on tribal and farmer communities selected for Indonesian-Indian theatre fest,"Bengaluru group Art Cross Theatre Main’s ‘Hum, Bharat Ke Log’ is among the eight plays at the festival

Renowned Urdu and Hindi playwright Habib Tanvir’s Hirma ki Amar Kahani was about a tribal community in India of the 1950s, caught in a conflict between the whims of a king, and the schemes of a new, supposedly democratic government. Though the play was written three decades later, the issues the tribal communities faced was still current.

When Sumit Acharya read the play another 30 years later (in 2019) he found the plot still relatable. Sumit’s theatre group, Art Cross Theatre Main, adapted and staged the play as Hum, Bharat Ke Log at Alliance Francaise last September. It has been selected for the Rangmanch - Theatre Festival of India in Indonesia.

“It is a satirical play, peppered with dark humour. It takes a look at the definition of development, tribal rights and movements,” says Sumit.

The festival will be online due to the pandemic. “The crew had to make an online version with the actors recording their bits and me remote-directing. Then, we put together all the bits,” says Sumit, “We had to make sure the editing was minimal so that it doesn’t feel like a movie. We have tried to maintain the essence of theatre.”

308,2020/10/10,Hathras gang rape | Trinamool Congress women’s wing takes out protest rally in Kolkata,"This is the third such protest by the Trinamool women’s cell this week

The Trinamool Congress women’s wing held a rally in the city on Saturday continuing its protests against the alleged gangrape and murder at Hathras and increase in atrocities against women in BJP-ruled states.

Each participant in the rally, which was participated by hundreds of women activists of the party, carried posters which read ‘The Dalit Woman is our Daughter’ in black and shouted slogans.

This is the third such protest by the Trinamool women’s cell this week despite the pandemic. It had taken out processions on the same issue on Tuesday and Thursday in other parts of the city.

The participants walked from Hazra crossing to Esplanade covering a distance of about 3 km on Saturday.

The president of Trinamool Mahila Congress, Chandrima Bhattacharya said “We want to register our protests against the atrocities against Dalits and women in BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.”

Ms. Bhattacharya, who is also a Minister in the Mamata Banerjee government, accused the BJP-ruled states of creating division among upper and lower castes and dividing the society.

Similar protest rallies were taken out out by the party’s women activists in different districts of the state earlier this week.

West Bengal Chief Minister and party supremo Mamata Banerjee had walked in the first such protest by Trinamool on October 3 and had hit out at BJP calling it the “biggest pandemic in the country“.

City Commissioner of Police Anuj Sharma also said that puja committees should ensure that revellers adhere to the physical distancing norms inside pandals and are given masks by puja committees if they do not have them.

He asked organisers to mark spaces for revellers near the pandals in keeping with the physical distancing norms and make separate entry and exit points in them.

“Please don’t compromise on COVID safety guidelines already stipulated by the government. Keep the pandal free on all three sides and make sure everyone wears masks. Keep a stock of masks to distribute among the pandal hoppers if they are not found wearing them,” Mr. Sharma said.

Mr. Sharma said that people can visit puja pandals a whole week more this time to avoid overcrowding anywhere. They can start visiting the pandals four days before the puja begins till October 29, three days after the Vijaya Dashami day.

The immersion processions, which traditionally see large gatherings every year, should not take circuitous routes to the Ganga or the nearest water body from the pandal and instead have the minimum number of people accompanying them for the purpose, he said.

Cultural programmes which draw huge crowds cannot be held in or near the puja pandals.

“We are working on all the guidelines given by the government. We offered all cooperation to the CP today,” said Somen Dutta, an office-bearer of the Forum for Durgotsab and the general secretary of Kashi Bose Lane Puja Committee, which organises one of the most popular pujas in the city.

311,2020/10/10,A crowdsourced database to help artists during pandemic,"It will form key part of a new policy expected to be announced by the Rajasthan govt. shortly

In an attempt to extend benefits of the government's schemes during the COVID-19 pandemic, a database of artists practising in different spheres of crafts and techniques in Rajasthan is being created with the help of crowdsourcing. The initiative will ensure support to the artist community that has been deprived of regular livelihood for several months.

State Art and Culture Minister B.D. Kalla will formally launch the campaign at a function here on Saturday. The database will include basic details along with genre of art forms, such as performing arts, visual arts, literary arts, dying arts, wandering arts, folk arts and tribal arts.

The initiative follows a social media campaign undertaken by civil society groups and research institutions for helping out the Langa-Manganiyar folk artistes of western Rajasthan. The “Maru Mani” (Jewels of Desert) campaign was launched in June this year for getting and distributing monetary support to preserve the rich heritage of traditional music and dance forms of the Thar desert. Mugdha Sinha, Secretary, Art and Culture Department, said on Friday that Rajasthan was the first State in the country to take this initiative. “Reaching out to and involving stakeholder artists themselves in collecting the data through Google Form is going to be a participative policy making and inclusive approach,” she said.

New policy

The digital database will form a key part of a new policy on art and culture expected to be announced shortly in the State. Ms. Sinha, who is also Director-General, Jawahar Kala Kendra, said the Chief Minister's Lok Kalakar Protsahan Yojana, launched in April, had extended support to 337 artists with an expenditure of Rs.9 lakh.

The “Maru Mani” campaign involved holding of virtual events on safeguarding the intangible cultural heritage and diverse cultural traditions from Jodhpur district's Moklawas village, where a Thar desert museum has been established. At a two-day event in August, experts called for preservation of socio-cultural practices of indigenous people through community-based and government's initiatives.

312,2020/10/10,VACB squads conduct flash raids at crusher units,"Bid to mine beyond permitted levels and evade payment of ad valorem duty to govt.

Complaints raised by various environmental organisations against the illegal operation of a few leading quarry and crusher units in the district have found results, with the latest flash inspections by Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) squads.

The inspections at nine large-scale quarries on Friday found that there had been attempts to mine beyond the permitted quantity and evade payment of ad valorem royalty to the government.

Officials said they had impounded 21 goods vehicles, which were used to transport excess quantity of stones and other quarry products. There were also vehicles without the required passes and permits to carry such materials. The flash check brought to light the need for intensified vigil in the area, they added.

“Details of the offences have already been submitted to the VACB Directorate and the Geology Department for follow-up measures. Those held for violations will have to pay both the compounding fee and the pending royalty before resuming lawful operations,” said a senior VACB officer. The officer also confirmed that those who were nabbed for serious violations owned large-scale companies.

Based on the VACB report, Geology Department officials will initiate action. The regional units of the VACB have been directed to step up vigil and conduct follow-up inspections by deploying more squads. A State-level meeting will soon be convened to discuss the matter.

Meanwhile, leaders of environmental organisations said the Geology Department was accountable for poor surveillance in the sector and absence of legal action against violators. They also accused officials of cold-shouldering confidential petitions against major quarry operators, besides ignoring local agitations against such projects.

“The illegal players in the field are equally exploiting natural resources and the poor government mechanism. If the government is truthful, it should enhance the strength of the Geology Department and streamline checking,” said M.V. Rajan of Paristhithi Samrakshana Samiti. He pointed out that the mishandling of explosives and their storage in quarries would be another area of unseen violations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/vacb-squads-conduct-flash-raids-at-crusher-units/article32817321.ece

The United Democratic Front (UDF) district committee on Friday organised a protest march to the collectorate, demanding the resignation of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

Inaugurating the march, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly M.K. Muneer sought the Chief Minister’s resignation in the light of evidence that a key accused in the gold smuggling case was appointed as consultant with the approval of the Chief Minister’s Office. Mr. Vijayan had degraded himself by encouraging and protecting suspects in the case through the diplomatic channel, he alleged.

Dr. Muneer said the Chief Minister could not feign ignorance about the case following the confession of Swapna Suresh, the key accused, that she had met him on several occasions. If the Chief Minister is adamant not to step down, the UDF will have no recourse but to intensify its agitation, he said.

M.K. Raghavan, MP, said the public by now had seen the real face of the Chief Minister who colluded with the corrupt and looters.

318,2020/10/10,Need to undertake archaeological excavation at Kinnimangalam: experts,"The recent findings at a mutt in Kinnimangalam near Madurai are very crucial to understand the history of the region. An archaeological excavation must be undertaken at the site to date the findings discovered there, said K. Amarnath Ramakrishna, superintending archaeologist, Archaeological Survey of India (Goa Circle), on Saturday.

He was speaking through a virtual platform during an event organised by Karuthu Pattarai at Karumathur near here to discuss the importance of recent findings at Kinnimangalam.

Madurai Member of Parliament Su. Venkatesan said that the findings at Kinnimangalam help to understand the ancient Tamil civilisation. He said that the Union government was taking several measures to undermine the archaeological findings in Tamil Nadu. Tamil Brahmi inscriptions were found in several rock paintings and pot shreds in Tamil Nadu. He congratulated art historian K.T. Gandhirajan and his team for discovering the inscriptions at Kinnimangalam.

The earliest inscription found at the site was a Tamil-Brahmi inscription, dating back to around the 3rd century and 2nd century BCE, found on a broken pillar at the mutt. The inscription read “Egan Aadhan Kottam”. Another vattezhuthu inscription, belonging to 7th or 8th century CE was also found. This was the inscription which had the word ‘pallipadai’ (sepulchral shrine). Another inscription belonging to the 18th century was also found.

Tiruchuli MLA Thangam Thennarasu’s pre-recorded video file was played during the event. He said that the findings at the mutt are from different periods and the mutt was continuously functioning till date.

M. Arul Anandam, the 67th descendant of the mutt, said that during the ancient period, a total of 34 skills were taught at the mutt.

S. Rajavelu, adjunct professor at Alagappa University in Karaikudi, said that Kinnimangalam and Keeladi have ancient connections. He said that the vattezhuthu inscription has the earliest mention of the word ‘pallipadai’. He said that a palm leaf manuscript written in vattezhuthu is extremely rare and was found in the mutt.

Mr. Gandhirajan, who discovered many evidences from the mutt, spoke on other historical evidence found at the site, apart from the inscriptions.

Excavation in-charge at Keeladi B. Asaithambi said that Kinnimangalam was part of the ancient trade route of Pandya kingdom. He said Tamil-Brahmi script was still being followed at the mutt.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/lvaywd/article32822910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ma11SuVenkatesanjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/need-to-undertake-archaeological-excavation-at-kinnimangalam-experts/article32822911.ece

Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan has urged A.P. Maheswari, Director General of Central Reserve Police Force, to set up at least one examination centre each in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to enable job aspirants to appear for written examination for CRPF Paramedical Staff Examination – 2020 on August 31.

In a memorandum sent on Saturday, he expressed his disappointment that none of the nine centres planned across India was in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.

The CRPF has issued a notification calling for applications for 24 posts of Group ‘B’ and ‘C’ non-ministerial, non-gazetted, combatised staff on all-India basis with the last date of application on August 31. The total declared vacancies are around 780 and the date of written examination has been fixed on December 20.

The MP said that the notification had listed only nine centres for examination. Among them, five are in northern states, two in southern States, one each in western and eastern parts of India.

“I do not find anything wrong in having five centres in northern States. But, equity is not there for other parts of country in distribution of examination centres. Shockingly, there is no examination centre in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,” he said.

This unequal distribution would put candidates from Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in a great difficulty in view of Covid 19 and movement of people is a risk. This should not be a deterrent for aspirants for competing for the posts declared. The MP urged the DG to increase the examination centres and ensure proper distribution to all parts of the country.

As the last date to submit applications is over, he also requested the DG to extend the last date by one month from the date of revised notification to accommodate new applications in view of changes in original notification.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/mp-wants-cprf-to-set-up-exam-centre-in-tn-puducherry/article32822364.ece

The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has issued guidelines on survey of properties in future for authorities to follow. The court has also wanted government officials to be held accountable for failing in their duty in conducting such surveys.

Justice S. Vaidyanathan observed, “We are now in the era of global digitalisation and by use of advanced technology / machinery, the survey could be easily done so as to bring the issue to a logical conclusion with the satisfaction of both parties.”

The court said that on receipt of charges towards Survey or Re-survey, it should be conducted within 30 days. The entire process shall be photographed and videographed by authorities.

In case of failure on the part of the official concerned to conduct a survey, the cost of application shall be returned to the parties, apart from recovering ₹ 2,500 from the salary of the official. Departmental proceedings should also be initiated against such officials.

A register shall be maintained with regard to the name of the person who has gone for the survey, area of survey, date of survey, completion of survey, reason for not surveying the property. The same shall be recorded periodically and verified by a superior officer, the court said.

The judge said the details shall be made available to the parties concerned or any person, when required under the Right to Information Act. A constant vigil of the officials of Revenue Departments is necessary to regulate the revenue-related works, he said.

The district administrations shall use drone technology to conduct accurate survey of properties, which will throw light on encroachment on Government lands, like public roads, parks, lakes, odai, etc... the court observed.

Pendency of litigation before courts was not a bar for the authorities to conduct survey or resurvey in the absence of any stay / interim order / interim injunction from proceeding further, the judge said.

The judge lamented that it was unfortunate that officials were demanding bribes even for doing their duties and directed the State to issue a circular on incorporating the guidelines in a month.

328,2020/10/10,"Frontline warriors ensured low COVID-19 death rate in Udupi, says Jagadeesha","DC was speaking at a workshop to motivate them

Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha on Saturday said that Udupi was one among three districts in Karnataka that registered the lowest deaths owing to COVID-19.

The district is separate from the other two as COVID-19 patients in those districts were shifted elsewhere for advanced treatment, while critical patients were treated in Udupi itself, he said.

This was because of the dedicated work by the COVID-19 frontline warriors, Mr. Jagadeesha said.

He was speaking at a workshop organised to motivate frontline warriors to enable them to discharge their duties without any stress at Udupi.

The frontline warriors comprising government doctors, Health Department officials, doctors in district expert team, tahsildars, executive officers etc., have been working relentlessly to save lives, thereby keeping the death rate in the district at the lowest.

At the same time, the administration gave importance to their safety too, he said, adding thus no warrior has died in the district.

Private hospitals too have extended maximum support in the fight against COVID-19, the DC said.

Mr. Jagadeesha said the administration as a whole has collectively faced the pandemic through lockdown, unlocks, quarantining people entering the district from outside and their health check-up, safety of migrant workers etc., all these days. The number of COVID-19 positive patients in the district came down considerably as the warriors did not listen to criticism on social media.

Besides fighting COVID-19 effectively, the district has also been at the forefront in delivering citizen services for 12 months.

District COVID-19 Nodal Officer Prashanth Bhat, who could not receive the felicitations during Independence Day, was felicitated on the occasion.

Dr. Rao said palliative care ensures access to the best standard of care and highest level of comfort for the patient. It also ensures best support to the family members.

Palliative care was relevant in this pandemic as World Health Organisation has said that any approach that does not include palliative care was “medically deficient and ethically indefensible”, he said.

332,2020/10/10,Verdant Sasihithlu Beach kept under lock by local gram panchayat,"While ZP CEO defends gram panchayat action, Deputy Commissioner says no beach can be kept out of bounds for public.

The verdant Sasihithlu beach that hosted the first Indian Open Surfing Championship in 2017 is kept under locks by the Haleyangadi Gram Panchayat, with many people saying that the gram panchayat had been acting without any authority.

While the panchayat has erected a gate at the entry of the beach, it has also been, through a contractor, collecting entry fee, ₹ 30 to ₹ 50, depending upon vehicles, which even the local people have objected to. Besides being closed during nights, the gate remains closed in the mornings too, said a stakeholder in the tourism sector.

It all started when the district administration upgraded a kutchcha road to a bitumen road from Sasihithlu village to the estuary of the Nandini and the Shambhavi, about one kilometre, before the Surfing Challenge. The Haleyangadi Gram Panchayat not only erected the gate but also built some small structures leasing them out. Subsequently, sea erosion swallowed most part of the beach, mainly due to non-removal of coffer bund built upstream the Nandini to facilitate construction of a bridge.

Shobendra Sasihithlu, a fishermen leader, told The Hindu that local residents registered their opposition during a recent held Grama Sabha to entry fee collection without the gram panchayat providing any facility. Residents want the beach to remain open throughout the day, he said.

People engage in angling and other activities on the verdant beach.

However, the Panchayat Development Officer, who did not want to be named, told The Hindu, “What can the panchayat do if the contractor does not open the gates.”

Chief Executive Officer of Panambur Beach Development Project Yatish Baikampady said that the land around Sasihithlu beach does not belong to the gram panchayat but to the Revenue Department. The gram panchayat has no authority to restrict people’s entry into the beach.

Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer R. Selvamani, however, defended the gram panchayat action saying that the local government had the authority to ensure safety of people under the Panchayat Raj Act. He, however, did not reveal the provision of law. The gram panchayat opens the gates at 9 a.m., he said and added that he would direct it to keep the gates opened from dawn to dusk. The gram panchayat had to take the step when the district administration and the police and others said that the beach could not be patrolled all the time and the local people too did not want visitors there.

Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said that no beach could be kept out of bounds for general public and he would get the Sasihithlu issue examined. The administration is committed to developing the beach into a tourism destination offering recreation facilities to the public and providing livelihood to the local people.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/fuhnga/article32818946.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10MNSASIHITLUBEACH1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/verdant-sasihithlu-beach-kept-under-lock-by-local-gram-panchayat/article32818947.ece

334,2020/10/10,"Living in harmony with nature vital in preventing pandemics, says WHO Chief Scientist","She was delivering the convocation address at the 10th Annual Virtual Convocation of Nitte University.

Chief Scientist and Deputy Director General of World Health Organisation (WHO) Sowmya Swaminathan on Friday said that living in harmony with the environment and animal kingdom was very critical to preventing global pandemics. This week, the world witnesses 32 million known COVID-19 cases and over a million deaths, she said.

She was delivering the convocation address at the 10th Annual Virtual Convocation of Nitte (Deemed to be University) here through a video message. Nitte, on the occasion, conferred a honorary doctorate degree D.Sc on K. Kasturirangan, scientist and Chancellor, Central University of Rajasthan.

Speaking on the pandemic outbreak, Dr. Swaminathan said, “But the fact is that, over the years, viruses have made the jump from the animal kingdom to human beings. We have seen it with HIV, SARS 1, Zika, Nipah and Ebola. There is also a long list of lesser known viruses. Most of these viruses have jumped from animals to human beings. The way in which we are living in harmony with the environment and with the animal kingdom is very critical.”

She said that human beings come into close contact with animals through deforestation by urbanisation. It also includes illegal wildlife trade, where animals come in contact with domesticated species. “It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 virus originated from bats but there was an intermediate host and that investigation is in progress,” she said.

Dr. Swaminathan said that socio-economic disparities impact health outcomes that became clear during the pandemic. Minorities and marginalised people in countries around the world were the most vulnerable. The mortality rate among the Black and the Hispanic populations in the U.S. was two times that of the White American. In the U.K., British Asian minorities, African and Asian ethnic minorities had a much higher incidence of infection.

Scientists had said that the outbreak would happen one day as WHO’s list had a disease called Pathogen X, meaning an unknown disease related to respiratory Pathogen that could occur any time.

335,2020/10/10,"Police seize vehicle, gun used by assailants in Sullia murder case","The Sullia police on Friday seized the vehicle and also the smooth-bore breach loading (SBBL) gun allegedly used by the four assailants involved in the murder of 40-year-old Sampath Kumar, an accused in the murder of Bharatiya Janata Party activist Balachandra Kalagi from Kodagu district, in Sullia on Thursday.

Superintendent of Police B.M. Laxmiprasad said that the multi-utility vehicle was found abandoned at a place about 15 km away from the place Kumar was murdered.

The police launched a search in that area and recovered the SBBL gun. “We have identified those involved in the murder. A special police team is on the lookout for the assailants,” he said. It is believed that the crime was to avenge the murder of BJP Kodagu district secretary Kalagi in March 2019.

The 40-year-old Kumar was among the three persons arrested by the Kodagu police for their alleged involvement in the murder of Kalagi. Kumar was accused of giving “supari” to those who drove a lorry to hit the vehicle in which Kalagi was seated. Initially, registered as a case of motor vehicle accident, it turned out to be a murder.

On Thursday morning, Kumar was attacked by four persons soon after he got into his car. Kumar was shot at and assaulted with lethal weapons as he started to flee. The assailants shot at Kumar as he entered the house of his neighbour Thimmappa. The assailants followed and assaulted Kumar and Thimmappa, who tried to intervene.

337,2020/10/10,"Worst is over, economic recovery faster than expected: Keki Mistry","The government should identify the job creating sectors and address their issues on priority, AIMA said in a release quoting the CEO

Mortgage lender HDFC Ltd’s CEO Keki Mistry on Saturday said the “worst is behind us” and the economic recovery has been faster than expected.

Stating that the December quarter growth could outperform the expansion logged in the corresponding quarter a year ago, Mr. Mistry said that the Indian economy has shown its resiliency.

Benign interest rate regime will continue going forward and that rates will go up only after economic activity gathers more pace and inflation pressure rises, Mistry, vice chairman and CEO, HDFC Ltd, said at an online dialogue organised by the All India Management Association (AIMA).

He, however, said that interest rates have bottomed out.

The government should identify the job creating sectors and address their issues on priority, AIMA said in a release quoting him.

Mr. Mistry said housing and real estate sector is the biggest employer in the economy after agriculture, and that 80% of the workforce in the sector require minimal skills.

He also sought priority support for the manufacturing sectors.

Talking about the repayment issues in the housing and the real estate sector, Mistry said that he expected non-performing loans to be in single digits.

The veteran financial sector player also said that most of the job losses during COVID-19 were confined to low-income workers and the job losses for the kind of people who borrow money were not alarming.

The non-performing individual loans could be in the range of 2.5-4%, which is also the extent of loans that the RBI has allowed to restructure, Mr. Mistry added.

On the economic condition, Mr. Mistry said the Indian economy had proved to be resilient.

“The worst is behind us and the recovery has been faster than expected. By the end of December, the economy would be at the pre-COVID levels for most sectors. The December quarter growth could be better than the growth in the December quarter last year,” he said.

However, Mr. Mistry qualified his optimism saying that a lot depended on whether another virus wave hits in the winter. Still, he said, the government was aware that India could not afford another lockdown.

Job creation and leaving money in the hands of the people should be the top two priorities of the government, Mr. Mistry said.

Consumption being 60% of the Indian economy, the recovery and growth efforts have to be led by boosting consumption, he said.

“The cost of lowering taxes would not be too high whereas the benefits from higher consumption would far outweigh the revenue loss to the government. While the corporate tax rates had gone down, the peak rate for individual tax rate had gone up from 35 per cent to 44 per cent,” Mr. Mistry said.

Among others, Harsh Pati Singhania, President AIMA and Vice Chairman and Managing Director, JK Paper Ltd, said that interest rates could still be lowered a little to stimulate the economy.

Mr. Singhania said there was a desperate need for creating demand.

“The government needs to be bold at this point of time. Economic theory is one thing, but we need things to happen on the ground right now,” he said.

Kirloskar Brothers Chairman and Managing Director Sanjay Kirloskar said the economy was slowing down even before COVID-19 and the September performance of many sectors was better than that in the same month last year, the release said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/cqfxqg/article32822473.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11-BUKEKIMISTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/worst-is-over-economic-recovery-faster-than-expected-keki-mistry/article32822474.ece

Several airlines have delayed payments, amounting to ₹2,400 crore, to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) for using airports because of losses sustained following the drop in travel demand during COVID-19. The biggest defaulter among all airlines is the Air India (AI) Group which owes more than 80% of these dues.

The AAI has also declared SpiceJet and GoAir as ‘cash-and-carry airlines,’ implying they will need to pay daily rentals to be able to use the airports. As per official data, AI owed ₹1,887 crore, Alliance Air ₹97 crore and Air India Express ₹12.55 crore.

Among the private carriers, IndiGo owed ₹150 crore, SpiceJet ₹140 crore, GoAir ₹58.75 crore, AirAsia India ₹21.61 crore and Vistara ₹2.79 crore. But AAI said these carriers had ensured the dues do not exceed the bank guarantees given by them. COVID-19 had also impacted AAI’s earnings from food and beverages and retaining concessionaires at its airports as they have a revenue-sharing model that has taken a hit because of the drop in passenger footfalls at airports, Arvind Singh, Chairman, AAI said recently.

“The first two months of lockdown led to a revenue shortfall of 80% compared with the previous quarter. It has improved since then but hasn’t crossed the 50% mark,” Mr. Singh explained.

These events have forced AAI to avail a loan of ₹1,500 crore from the State Bank of India for its working capital requirements and it is likely to go into the red for FY21, according to a recent statement in Parliament. AAI has been a profitable entity for several years, paying dividends to the government. In FY20, the AAI earned a profit of more than ₹3,600 crore from a revenue of about ₹14,367 crore.

The Consortium of Indian Associations termed as a ‘big blow’ to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) the RBI’s affidavit in the Supreme Court pleading for vacating its stay order on the classification of NPA and the Centre ruling out further relief measures under the loan moratorium scheme.

Consortium convener K.E. Raghunathan appealed to the Prime Minister to intervene and protect the interests of MSMEs. In a statement, he said, “The lockdown was implemented suddenly in national interest and it was extended for nearly six months for which MSMEs are not responsible.”

He pointed out that uncertainty abounds over the next six months of business activity and that MSMEs continued to pay for fixed costs though revenue has been eluding the sector for the last six months.

Earlier, the consortium had suggested several measures to the Centre.

Mr. Raghunathan said an estimated ₹3.5 lakh crore were due to MSMEs from large industries, PSUs, SPSUs and central/State governments. These, he said, should be paid immediately. He also appealed to the Centre to waive income tax for the current year for those earning less than ₹15 lakh. “This will spur middle-income individuals to spend, kindling demand.”

He also suggested that small enterprises with turnover of less than ₹5 crore be exempted from collection or levy of GST till March. “This will help them offer competitive prices. This move alone can bring down end prices by 18%.”

He urged the States and the Centre to spend at least 75% of their budgeted procurements for FY21 before December 2020 to boost order books and create job opportunities.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fcs10l/article32823202.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11BUMSME,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/centres-rbis-stand-in-sc-on-loans-is-a-big-blow-to-msmes/article32823203.ece
341,2020/10/10,"We need a scrappage policy, says Cummins India MD Ashwath Ram","Clean tech futile if old vehicles keep running: Cummins India

Engines and power equipment supplier Cummins India is expecting full revival of business in 2022, according to its managing director Ashwath Ram. Cummins India had a turnover of over Rs. 13,000 crores in 2019 and employs around 10,000 people. The company has been hit hard by the pandemic. Excerpts:

How has COVID-19 affected Cummins India?

All our factories were shut for the first two months of the lockdown and once the ramp-up started, we have gradually picked up and are now at roughly about 70% capacity utilisation. Demand differs across segments.

Some segments such as construction or our distribution business units are doing quite well and demand is rising pretty rapidly. [But]demand from sectors like rail are badly impacted.

In our power generation segment, demand from data centres, telecom, residential reality and FMCG is moving up rapidly. But segments such as commercial real estate and heavy manufacturing are reviving at a much slower rate. Overall, we are about 70% of the peak of the pre-COVID level.

When do you think the auto sector, mainly HCVs, will bounce back?

The heavy commercial vehicles segment has been significantly impacted because it had already slowed down due to many developments such as the NBFC crisis which happened the year before last. It triggered the slowdown and then there were many changes in regulations.

The government allowed 20-25% extra loading on all vehicles already on the roads. Then we were supposed to do the BS-VI transition in April which was very expensive. It was also the fastest we had to go from BS-IV to BS-VI in three years as against 10 years in other countries.

When we launched products with investments worth thousands of crores of rupees, we were already in the lockdown; so it was like a perfect storm with all variables being bad.

The market for the medium and heavy commercial market is now at a 10-year low. We haven't seen such poor demand since 2008 or 2009. The demand in medium and heavy commercial vehicles is closely linked to GDP; as the economy recovers, this market will also bounce back.

This market will fully revive only by 2022. But it has already started to come up, slowly. By January 2021 we will be at 50% of pre-COVID levels; now, we are at 30-40%.

There must be a heavy financial impact on the company....

Absolutely, its really really tough. We are managing through the cycle mainly because many of the investments were made in the last 3 years. We are not making any new investments now. Also, we have taken many cost-cutting measures at various levels from operational resources to human resource and in various other aspects of our businesses. We had employee lay-offs early this year, we have cut employees’ wages, we are working from home, we are adopting every form of cost cutting we can think of to make sure that we come out of this low demand period. Also we have made massive investments in the country so we can leverage those investments and keep growing.

Are you scaling down your investments?

In fact we are investing more into new technologies and new products because we believe that with this pandemic, certain aspects of the business are going to change significantly and it benefits technology leaders like Cummins. So we are scaling up what we do in India and the kind of products we are developing. So, we are looking at it as an opportunity to gain market share.

India and China are at logger heads. Have your exports to China been affected?

No. As a matter of fact, we have had record exports to China during the last 3-4 months and there has been no impact on our business with China. We have created advantages versus China in certain products. We have the scale here as well as a cost advantage. Our labour cost is roughly 20-25% lower than China’s. So, are pricing is competitive.

We are able to get entry as well as continued business from China. If relations between the two countries worsens, I don't know how that will go. But as of today, we continue to have strong exports with China. We sell them gensets, engines, manufactured components...

What would you like the government to do?

The government is taking a long time to introduce the scrappage policy. That would certainly help this industry because with BS-VI, the pollution levels will see 60-70% improvement over BS-IV standards. Even today we have BS-I, -II and -III vehicles running on the roads.

Over 90% of the pollution is caused by these old vehicles. So, we have introduced these ultra-clean engines to the point that [exhaust from] those engines is cleaner than the Delhi air. But, it is not going to have any impact if these old pieces of equipment keep running.

So, the government needs to introduce the scrappage policy immediately. Also, to boost demand, they should [waive] GST. A lot of export incentives have now been taken away and there is no clarity yet on what is going to happen from January. We're going to lose money.

What is the outlook?

I am very optimistic and bullish about a company and its growth prospects. I think we are reviving strongly and we're confident that will come out of this in a strong manner.",,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rnss7f/article32823188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th11BUAshwath-Ram-MD-Cummins-India,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/we-need-a-scrappage-policy/article32823189.ece
342,2020/10/10,Saving lives under the long shadow of the pandemic,"Along with fighting the virus, there is a growing need to make mental health and suicide prevention a priority

The COVID-19 pandemic has ‘impacted populations around the world in multiple ways. The fear of being infected and anxiety about an uncertain present and future have impacted mental health severely. Lockdowns have led to isolation, in turn heightening anxiety and causing depression in societies, particularly in vulnerable communities’.

While the novel coronavirus pandemic is ‘unprecedented in its scope and scale, previous studies suggest an elevated risk of suicide during such times’. There is some evidence that ‘deaths by suicide increased in the United States during the 1918-19 influenza pandemic, and among older people in Hong Kong during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic’. However, it has been noted that a rise in suicides in the wake of the pandemic is not inevitable. In fact, preliminary information from New Zealand, Japan and the United Kingdom suggest lower suicidal behaviour at least in the early phase of the pandemic.

Also read | Meet flags rising mental health issues during pandemic

Before the pandemic, India’s progress as one of the fastest growing economies led to large paradigm shifts in the daily lives of its citizens. Major lifestyle shifts led to the rise of many lifestyle disorders in the last decade. Mental health disorders are one of the disorders of most concern, which have been swept under the carpet of stigma and discrimination. Many suicides are related to psychological disorders and distress.

New normal, consequences

The pandemic’s massive toll on human well-being — in a physical and mental sense — has completely changed the way people live. Necessary precautions such as social distancing, limited interactions and mask usage have become the new normal, with a huge social, physical, economic and mental consequences.

Unfortunately, India has the dubious distinction of reporting the first COVID-19-related suicide in the world, on February 12, 2020. While the pandemic has affected the entire country, case incidence rates are the worst in States such as Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. A worrying overlap reveals itself as some of these States are also major contributors to suicidal deaths per year — Maharashtra (18,916), followed by Tamil Nadu (13,493), West Bengal (12,665), Madhya Pradesh (12,457) and Karnataka (11,288). Dire socio-economic conditions arising from the pandemic — mass migration, unemployment and economic distress — make at-risk groups even more vulnerable during these times.

Rising stress

While progress on a COVID-19 vaccine is promising, uncertainty as a result of the pandemic is here to stay for the foreseeable future. The fear of getting infected, coupled with a lack of knowledge and the economic fallout has created a new level of stress not seen by many before. This is compounded by isolation from the community, causing high levels of mental duress and ultimately, COVID-19-related suicides for many. This situation is the worse among vulnerable populations who are susceptible to greater risks of infections, such as health-care workers, infected people, the elderly, migrant workers, those from resource-poor backgrounds, women facing domestic violence, individuals with compromised immunity, and those suffering from physical or psychological problems.

Also read | Rise in post-traumatic stress disorder: survey

A case series of newspaper reports of suicide in India during the early lockdown phase found that suicide was associated with the fear of infection, social isolation and pandemic-related economic concerns. The findings reveal that one in four of these deaths occurred among hospitalised patients, demonstrating the need for extra care and vigilance during institutional treatment for either COVID-19 or any other illness. The sudden closure of alcohol/liquor outlets resulted in an increase in alcohol-related suicides.

As we continue to fight the novel coronavirus, there is a growing need to make mental health and suicide prevention a priority. At an individual level, any early signs of poor mental health such as a sudden change in behaviour, substance use, anxiety, disturbed sleep and difficulty in communication should not be ignored. While the feeling of uncertainty during this pandemic is normal, being informed and limiting ourselves to authentic sources of information and reducing exposure to distressing news is a good mechanism to help a person cope with the situation.

Media’s role

Suicide prevention requires a mix of a top-down and a bottom-up approach, ensuring that all interventions are rooted in empathy. India has created a task force to develop a national suicide prevention strategy. The plan incorporates the three universal strategies, including a ban or reduction in access to highly hazardous pesticides, reduction in consumption and availability of alcohol, and a non-sensationalised and responsible portrayal of suicide by the media. The media would need to follow Press Council of India’s guidelines on reportage of suicide and also create awareness about suicide prevention.

Seeking support is key

There is an urgent need for destigmatising suicide as a phenomenon and ensure there is an increase in the number of functional and accessible helplines and training of gatekeepers. Most importantly, a system intervention can focus on identifying, supporting and referring suicidal individuals at all levels of the health-care system. It is essential that if suicide has been attempted the individual has the required intervention and regular contact support.

Comment | The whys of death by suicide

A majority of individuals who are suicidal do not really want to die but find living difficult. Support at the right moment can change this decision. Understanding, compassion and support, at both an individual and the systemic levels, can save a life. On World Mental Health Day (October 10), there is the most important message for the ones who may be having suicidal thoughts: You are not alone and must reach out for support, as help is available.

343,2020/10/10,Show of unity: On AIADMK affairs,"The real test for the reunited AIADMK is in distribution of the party ticket for the election

By ending the rift over the Chief Ministerial candidate for the 2021 Tamil Nadu Assembly election, the leaders of the ruling AIADMK might have enthused the cadres, and also denied political rivals an opportunity to exploit the situation. But the real challenge is in winning on the plank of performance after two consecutive terms in power. In the absence of the party having a mass leader, both Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and his deputy in government, O. Panneerselvam, appear to have clearly understood their respective political limitations and made compromises. Mr. Panneerselvam, who had held the post of Chief Minister thrice for short tenures, has agreed to let Mr. Palaniswami be the party’s face in the election, perhaps realising that the latter has consolidated his hold among people who matter in the AIADMK. On his part, the Chief Minister shed his reluctance to constitute an 11-member steering committee, a long-pending key demand of Mr. Panneerselvam, to avert any rebellion from him, irrespective of its political impact. Though shorn of strong and charismatic leaders such as M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa, the AIADMK leadership showed enough resolve to stick together. Besides, it looked as if there was no role for any outsider this time, unlike in August 2017 when the Palaniswami and Panneerselvam factions merged, as the latter claimed, on the advice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This seems an achievement in itself given the public spectacle of Ministers playing messengers between them on August 15 and the sharp exchange of words at a marathon meeting of the party executive on September 28.

The nomination of Mr. Palaniswami, who became the Chief Minister in February 2017 under dramatic circumstances, ensures continuity; he has over the last few years acquired the image of a doer with a business-like approach. However, conflicts could still arise over the functions and powers of the steering panel, which appears to be an overarching body but with the balance seemingly tilted in favour of Mr. Palaniswami, who has six nominees, all cabinet ministers. The equations between Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Panneerselvam could be put to the test during the distribution of the party ticket to AIADMK aspirants. Electorally, the impact of the ruling party’s latest decisions will depend upon multiple factors including a possible realignment of political forces and actor Rajinikanth launching his proposed party. Besides, a further churning within the AIADMK cannot be ruled out if V.K. Sasikala, Jayalalithaa’s aide and the party’s ousted interim general secretary, chooses a political role for herself upon her release from jail in Bengaluru. And the party will have to contend with the main opposition, the DMK, which, along with allies, made a near-sweep of the Lok Sabha election last year.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/show-of-unity-the-hindu-editorial-on-aiadmk-affairs/article32816433.ece
344,2020/10/10,The right balance: On Shaheen Bagh and the right to protest,"Sudden, organic protests should not automatically invite the state’s strong arm

Long after Shaheen Bagh became a potent symbol of democratic resistance against a discriminatory law, the Supreme Court has ventured to hold that any such indefinite blockade of a public pathway is unacceptable. And that the administration ought to take action to remove “encroachments and obstructions” placed during such protests. The Court’s assertion was made even while “appreciating the existence of the right to peaceful protest against a legislation”. On the face of it, the Court’s view arises from a straightforward balancing of two contrasting rights — the right to protest and the right to free movement. However, a moot question is whether the manner and content of a protest should always conform to forms deemed acceptable by the law. Protests, by their very nature, are not always rooted in legality, but rather derive legitimacy from the rightness of the underlying cause and the extent of public support. In many cases, they are against laws and regulations perceived as unjust. A flash strike, a spontaneous road block, a call for a complete shutdown, or a campaign to fill up jails by defying prohibitory orders — each of these is not, in a strict sense, legal; but, at the same time, it is an inevitable part of the culture of protest in a democracy. In this case, the Court rightly notes that the administration neither negotiated with the protesters in Shaheen Bagh nor tried to clear the scene.

Any finding that a peaceful protest had continued too long, or in a place deemed inconvenient to others, should not encourage the administration to seek early curbs on the freedom of assembly. After the pandemic led to the end of the protests, there was little left for adjudication, and the Court’s remarks might come across as a gratuitous offering to administrators looking to de-legitimise protests. Following the earlier judgment that any ‘bandh’ is illegal, courts routinely stayed sector-wide strikes. Another aspect of the present ruling is the assertion that protests should be confined to “designated places”. Such judicial certitude may end up undermining the larger democratic need for public expression of dissent in a manner and place that would be most effective. While notified demonstrations are subject to regulations regarding time and space, it may not be possible to extend the same to spontaneous, organic and leaderless protests driven by a cause. The ruling should not form the basis for suppression of such protests by the force of the state. Both principles — the need for balance between the right to protest and the right to free movement, and the rule that protests should take place at designated spots — are salutary from an administrative point of view. But these cannot become unquestionable axioms to the point of rendering any and all protests that cause inconvenience to others the target of the strong arm of the state.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-right-balance-the-hindu-editorial-on-shaheen-bagh-and-the-right-to-protest/article32816432.ece

346,2020/10/10,HC stays criminal proceedings against Church of South India Trust Association,"The High Court of Karnataka has stayed till November 4 the criminal proceedings against the Church of South India Trust Association (CSITA) initiated by the city police and the provisional attachment of bank deposits by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on the allegation that the CSITA is unlawfully occupying the land of All Saints’ Church, Hosur Road, and received compensation from the BMRCL though the land actually belonging to the Defence authorities.

Justice Suraj Govindaraj passed the interim order on a petition filed by the CSITA questioning the legality of the criminal case registered by the city police on August 17, 2019 and the attachment of deposits of ₹59.52 crore by the ED on September 8, 2020.

The criminal proceedings were initiated based on the complaint filed by Indian Army’s Quartermaster, CMP Centre and School, Bengaluru, alleging that the CSITA unlawfully received compensation for land, measuring about 7426.886 sq.m acquired under Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act for the benefit of Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL).

Granted in 1884

It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that land with certain other land were granted to Lord Bishop and Archdeacon of Madras in 1884 by the president at the Court of His Highness, the Maharaja of Mysore, under the authority vested in him by the government of India, and no rents were required to be paid to the government.

The Indian Churches Trustees (ICT) took over the land of All Saints’ Church in 1929 following enactment of Indian Churches Act, 1927. Though the Bangalore Civil Station and Bangalore Military Area were restored to Maharaja of Mysore after Indian independence in 1947, the land granted by the crown prior to retrocession were recognised as valid grant, the petitioner claimed while contending the ICT, which owned title over the land, in 1980 appointed the CSITA as new trustees.

It was also pointed out in the petition that the Defence authorities never raised any objection or claimed the land even when a portion of the land was given for Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board in 1972 for construction of a water reservoir.

The petitioner also contended that the Defence authorities had not objected even when the notification for acquiring portion of the All Saints’ Church land for metro project was issued in March 2017 and disbursal of part payment of compensation to petitioner was made in April 2019. The Defence authorities raised objection for the first time in July 2019 and complaint with the police was lodged without waiting for the petitioner’s response.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hc-stays-criminal-proceedings-against-church-of-south-india-trust-association/article32823534.ece
347,2020/10/10,Bengaluru International Arts Festival takes virtual route,"Normally held for nine days at nine venues within the city, the Bengaluru International Arts Festival (BIAF) 2020, has taken the virtual route this time around. For their 13th edition, which was inaugurated on Friday, the BIAF has chosen the theme ‘Celebrating Harmony Through Arts’.

“We had hoped the pandemic situation would’ve improved by October, but when it didn’t, we decided to go ahead with a virtual format. It was encouraging to get a positive response from artistes in Russia, Indonesia, and Malaysia for this year’s event,” said Veena Murthy Vijay, a bharatanatyam and kuchipudi dancer, who founded this platform for performing arts with Suma Sudhindra, a veena maestro.

The BIAF has collaborated with Kala Yatra helmed by Sonal Mansingh and their events will also be streamed at this year’s fest.

The second leg of the festival from October 16 to 18 will see a kuchipudi performance by Swathi Atluri and a retelling of the Ramayana in the Bharatanatyam Margam format by the Punyah Dance Company, among other performances. “A modern dance presentation by the Tarak Dance Company, titled ‘Big High to New Normal’, will also be a part of the event,” she added.

349,2020/10/10,‘Improve conditions around Porur toll plaza’,"Proper shelters for commuters at the stopovers for MTC and long-distance buses on both sides of the plaza and better illumination around the facility figure prominently in a list of demands

Commuters boarding buses from the stopovers on both sides of the Porur toll plaza on Chennai Bypass want conditions around these stopovers improved. The list includes LED street lights, reflectors, safe service lanes and an ambulance.

The demand follows the easing of lockdown restrictions and the resultant resumption of many bus services — both MTC and long-distance bus services.

The toll plaza at Porur is one of two such facilities found on the 32-km-long four-lane Chennai Bypass. The other toll plaza is located in Ambattur.

“The bus stops at the toll plaza help residents from nearby areas board long-distance buses without having to travel to Koyambedu or Vandalur to do so. However, better facilities are needed at the toll plaza,” says S. Priya, a commuter from Porur.

The stopovers and their surroundings at the toll plaza lack basic facilities including sufficient lighting and proper shelters for commuters.

A huge number of hawkers can also be seen at the toll plaza selling eatables and a variety of knick-knacks. Toilets at the plaza don’t function properly, and this problem often includes lack of water. The toll plaza at Porur does not have reflectors, warning signboards, barricades and is not sufficiently illuminated at night.

Further, vehicles especially lorries would be parked on both sides of the toll plaza especially at night, and due to poor illumination, there is the risk of motorists, especially motorcyclists, accidentally ramming their vehicles into the stationary heavy vehicles. At night, motorcyclists navigate this section, using the headlights from the motorcycles and and street below the Bypass on Mount-Poonamallee Main Road. Motorcyclists point out that with the help of this illumination, they manage to notice the lorries parked near the toll plazas.

“Steps will be taken to provide basic facilities at the Porur toll plaza soon,” says an NHAI official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nwn3uw/article32821628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11dctngr-PorurToll-Plaza,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/improve-conditions-around-porur-toll-plaza/article32821629.ece
350,2020/10/10,"Gyms, parks open up","Residents’ associations are cautiously enabling access to common amenities

Let residents have fun but make sure they take all pandemic safety precautions – that is the new strategy being adopted by RWAs that are opening up the common amenities in the gated communities.

Recently, Prince Village Phase-I, a gated community in Tondiarpet, opened its gym and play area after much deliberation among residents. Both these amenities have been out of bounds for children and adults since March. With easing of lockdown restrictions, the temporary ban stands lifted.

The facilities team ensures the gym and play area are cleaned.

At Aashiana Apartment in Venus Colony, Alwarpet, badminton enthusiasts have to book a slot in advance via a WhatsApp group specifically created for it. Only two players can occupy the court at any given point of time. Every two players are given a 45-minute slot, which is followed by a 30-minute ‘no play’ time that is used to carry out cleaning at the court. The court is open only for an hour in the morning and three hours in the evening, as against three and six hours, respectively, before the pandemic.

CCTV cameras would be watching over players to check if they are flouting any rules, including if they have come to the court without wearing a mask.

“It’s difficult to control everyone and so we need to bring strong rules for the safety of all those living in the community,” says Gopinath V., acting secretary of Prince Village Phase-I Owners’ Association.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/28ckji/article32821573.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11dctondiarpet,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gyms-parks-open-up/article32821574.ece
351,2020/10/10,Gates at ICF South Colony swing open,"ICF South Colony has lifted the restrictions it had placed on the movement of outsiders within the quarters

For over six months, ICF South Colony shut the door on the outside world to keep those on the inside safe.

With two of its three gates kept locked at all hours, the Colony did not seek to couch its intentions in any form of ambiguity.

It’s only now, after all its three gates are open for outsiders, does the insularity of the past six months come home to its residents.

Spread across several acres, the housing society has around 1700 ICF employees who have taken residence there along with their families.

With tree-lined streets, a spacious playground, a park and other amenities, ICF South Colony has held out for people outside the locality.

And the society has always extended an attitude of welcome towards outsiders, without however compromising on the privacy and safety of its residents.

Besides, there was also the question of access that had to be extended to people.

Many motorists use the gates of the colony to access a shorter route to Perambur and Anna Nagar.

“You skip two signals and reach 12th Main Road by going inside the colony,” says Shahul Hameed, secretary of ICF South Colony Residents Association.

A. Udayappan, another committee member, points out that even in pre-COVID days, one of the entrance gates would be kept closed between 10 a.m. and noon to reduce the vehicular flow through the colony.

Precautionary measures

When the lockdown began in March, as a precautionary measure against COVID-19, the resident’s welfare association decided to block access to two of its gates. However, the main entrance was kept open with two security guard regulating the movement of motorists.

“We had taken various initiatives to keep residents in our quarters safe and these were undertaken after consultation with members,” says Hameed.

“We did not want outsiders and vendors to hang out inside the colony, so we put these restrictions in place,” says Hameed.

With various restrictions across Chennai having been eased, the Association decided to open its gates. While the main gate is open round-the-clock, the others offer restricted access to outsiders.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/w7p73n/article32821541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11dcicf,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gates-at-icf-south-colony-swing-open/article32821542.ece
352,2020/10/10,A day to remember at the police station,"Besides cake-cutting the previous day, police personnel get to spend the day with their family

Around 7.30 p.m., on September 29, J. Mari, a Grade-1 police constable, was on duty at Lotus Garden in Kilpauk, and he received a call from the writer at the Kilpauk police station (G-3) asking him to report 30 minutes before the routine evening roll call at 9 p.m.

A stream of possibilities raced through Mari’s mind. For, this is something he had never before been asked to do, in all of his 12 years of service. He sought to find out from a few colleagues what it was all about, but they feigned ignorance. As he stepped into the station, Mari was warmly greeted by two dozen police constables and the Station Inspector.

Murugesan Kottaiswamy, Inspector (Law & Order), Kilpauk police station, shook his hands, giving him an advanced birthday wish. September 29 was his birthday and the station celebrated it the previous day.

An initiative by the Greater Chennai City Police Commissioner, Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal, the personnel of all wings of the Police Department, including Armed Reserve (AR), Crime, Law & Order (L&O) and Traffic, are to be given a holiday on their respective birthday. They also receive a birthday greeting card signed by the Commissioner the previous evening.

“I was in tears as I had never witnessed such a gathering and a cake being cut for my birthday,” says 35-year-old Mari.

Initially, the police personnel were being invited to the office of the Deputy Commissioner or the Assistant Commissioner and given the greeting card. They would cut the cake together. However, due to time constraints and to prevent overcrowding during the pandemic, the celebrations started being conducted in the respective police stations during the roll call every day now.

The reason to celebrate during roll call is because all the police personnel are present at the station as they report or sign off from duty at that time. “The aim is to forge bonds between police personnel especially during these uncertain times when they have to risk their lives for the larger good,” says 53-year-old-Inspector Kottaiswamy, adding that the initiative brings a lot of cheer to the entire team.

The Greater Chennai Police Commissionerate has 140 police stations divided into four zones — North, South, West and East within its 12 police districts. The department is said to be continuing its earlier practice of wishing police personnel on their birthdays, over a microphone at 8 a.m in the city. The announcer will also convey the birthday wishes from the City Police Commissioner. Now that tradition has been extended to include the cutting of a cake and granting a day’s leave for birthday and marriage anniversary celebrations.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mcfkj6/article32821527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11DCKILPAUK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-day-to-remember-at-the-police-station/article32821528.ece
353,2020/10/10,New footpaths ‘inaugurated’ by vendors in Mogappair,"Constructed on Ambattur Industrial Estate Main Road in Mogappair, they don’t seem to do much for pedestrians

Only a few hours had elapsed after a new tiled footpath had been laid on both sides of the Ambattur Industrial Estate Main Road in Mogappair, and the pedestrian facility started getting noticeably used. Not so much by pedestrians as by vendors.

When the State Highways Department completed this work last week, sections of the pavements were occupied by vendors, with the result that pedestrians would have to get down and walk on the carriageway.

“Such encroachments not only prevent pedestrians from using a facility meant for them, but also damage it,” says V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar West (Phase – II) Residents Welfare Association.

The 60-feet Ambattur Industrial Estate Road provides access to over two dozen streets including Vinakar Koil street, Gandhi street, Ambedkar Street and Anna Street to reach Anna Nagar, Thirumangalam, Padi, Kolathur and Poonamallee High (PH) Road via Ambattur Estate Road. The stretch connects a number of neighbourhoods, including Nolambur, Mogappair, Padi, Thirumangalam, with the busy Jawaharlal Nehru (J.N)Main Road.

It was during the early months of the lockdown that the footpath was heightened by a foot to prevent inundation of the stretch as well as to ensure discharge of excess rainwater into the inlets.

Boulders have also been also erected along the new footpath to check unauthorised parking of vehicles, especially two-wheelers.

“Steps will be taken to prevent encroachments on the footpath,” says a State Highways Department official.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/1xjjqk/article32821520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11DCANGRSHOPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/new-footpaths-inaugurated-by-vendors-in-mogappair/article32821521.ece
354,2020/10/10,LED lights are coming up on a section of Surapet Main Road,"A irritant that marks the drive on the stretch of Surapet Main Road between Surapet and Puzhal will soon be a thing of the past. The State Highways Department has started work on installing LED lights on the stretch.

Motorists from areas like Red Hills, Padiyanallur, Puzhal, Annanoor, Thirumullavoyal, Avadi use Surapet Main Road to reach the central parts of the city via Ambattur and Anna Nagar.

As the ongoing flyover work in Retteri has been adding to the traffic chaos on Jawaharlal Nehru (J.N) Main Road, especially during rush hour, motorists from the Chennai’s western outskirts find it convenient to use Surapet Main Road to reach the central parts of the city in a short time.

In 2019, the State Highways Department widened the road between Puzhal and Surapet, making it a four-laner. Work on fitting street lights was pending.

“Prior to the lockdown, accidents were common on this stretch. Thankfully, lights have been installed now,” points out S. Jegan, a motorist from Puzhal.

As per the plan, more than 15 LED street lights would come up on the median, with every two street lights spaced 30 metres apart.

Each lamp pole will be have a height of 15 feet and lectrical fittings including LED bulbs on both sides. The entire is expected to be completed in a month. Reflectors will also be installed on accident-prone spots including narrow bends near the Puzhal intersection. The stretch is also a key MTC bus route that connects extended areas of the Greater Chennai Corporation including Athipet, Ambattur, Mannurpet, Oragadam, Korattur, Padi and Nolambur with Red Hills.

In 2019, culverts were constructed between Chennai Metrowater pumping station and a gas station, a distance of around 800 metres. Earlier, the 800-metres-stretch had a narrow bend with no street lights, median and reflectors. The area is also low-lying, making it prone to inundation. Motorists found it difficult to differentiate between the low-lying carriageway and the stormwater drain as both would be submerged in heavy rainwater.

In the past, there have been incidents of motorists slipping into the open drain. Motorists hope that installation of LED lights will make this stretch safer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/q5sd2a/article32821512.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11dcangrled,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/led-lights-are-coming-up-on-a-section-of-surapet-main-road/article32821513.ece
355,2020/10/10,Culvert work on Surapet Main Road expedited,"Constructed near Rakki theatre complex in Ambattur, this facility is expected to play a crucial role in checking inundation in nearby areas

The State Highways Department has expedited the construction of a culvert on Surapet Main Road, near Rakki theatre complex in Ambattur. Concrete roofing work undertaken recently provides evidence of this urgency.

The major monsoon-preparedness work began early this year following the widening of the existing stormwater drains. The culvert would play a crucial role in preventing inundation on that section.

Officials of the State Highways Department have pointed out that the new culvert being constructed to check inundation in areas around a section of Surapet Main Road with Rakki theatre complex at one end and the Oragadam junction (not to be confused with the Oragadam industrial hub) at the other end.

The new culvert will help excess rainwater in Oragadam get discharged to nearby streams that are connected to the Puzhal lake.

Surapet Main Road already has six culverts in Surapet and Puzhal as these neighbourhoods are located around Puzhal lake and get flooded during monsoon.

“The construction of a new culvert is a welcome measure as it will prevent inundation. However, the work should be completed before the onset of the northeast monsoon,” says K. Sarath from Ambattur.

As per estimates, the new culvert, built across the road, is 60 feet long and 10 feet wide and has a depth of 10 feet.

Oragadam junction is the key traffic point on the eight-kilometre-long Surapet Main Road, which connects Ambattur with Puzhal near the Central Prison. The junction is part of a short route to reach Anna Nagar and Tirumangalam from Ambattur, Mannurpet, Thirumullavoyal, J.J. Nagar and Maduravoyal.

Motorists coming from interior parts of Kallikuppam, Oragadam, Ambattur, Padi, Korattur, Nolambur, Anna Nagar West pass through this junction on their way to places like Maduravoyal, Porur and Tambaram via the Chennai Bypass Road.

Further, the junction provides a crucial link between the western parts of the city with the neighbouring districts including Kancheepuram and Thiruvallur via Chennai Bypass.

It also connects industrial belts in Sriperumbudur in Kancheepuram with the Kolkata Highway (NH:05) via Poonamallee High (PH) Road.

“The new culvert work will be completed by the end of October,” says an official of the State Highways Department.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mrqrjj/article32821499.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11dcculvert1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/culvert-work-on-surapet-main-road-expedited/article32821500.ece
356,2020/10/10,Shopping app goes into retirement,"It had been created by residents of a gated community in Siruseri as an in-house tech tool

In keeping with the easing of lockdown restrictions by the Government, residents of a gated community in Siruseri reportedly put certain in-house restrictions to a vote. A shopping system got dismantled, and so, a free web app that promoted it had to bow out. Created by residents, the app had punctuated shopping processes at two stores on the premises, with calculated pauses to ensure contact-less trading and social distancing. Its popularity growing beyond this community, it was even adopted by another. Despite its evident usefulness, the app lost favour with the residents.

Over the last seven months, best-laid plans by RWAs have come unstuck after initial success. In the end, these initiatives are not missteps, only miscalculations. Their applicability and value can’t be doubted. Only that, sometimes, their relevance was overestimated. Sometimes, inherent challenges had been glossed over.

At L&T Eden Park, this web app had made it possible for residents to shop at an in-house supermarket and vegetable store, from their living rooms. From a virtual shelf, they could check items into the cart. Before the purchase rolled into the reception, the resident would be notified, thereby cutting out queues in the collection area. In terms of social distancing in a shopping space, this was just what the doctor ordered.

Besides, every day, a special hour was earmarked for a pre-determined block which enabled residents of all eight blocks to buy all essentials before these ran out of stock. The creators kept finetuning the app, bunging in features to address previously unacknowledged issues. “Order till availability” was such a feature: It kept the order alive, carrying it over till the item was available at the stores and delivered to the resident. The creators also sought to address a socio-economic question by bringing small vendors — such as the tender coconut and milk vendors — into its purview.

And then, reality caught up with it.

Sathish Arcot, a resident of L&T Eden Park, says, “The vendors expressed their concern that the lack of shoppers’ footfall was affecting their business. Obviously, if people visited a store they would make more purchases than if they shopped from home. Besides, with government easing lockdown restrictions considerably, residents wanted an in-person shopping experience, of course with safety protocols in place. And this meant the app had to go.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ymq15k/article32821490.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11dcapp,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/shopping-app-goes-into-retirement/article32821492.ece
357,2020/10/10,Urban homeless families want homes in TN Slum Clearance Board tenements,"Families in north Chennai have sent a petition to the Chennai Corporation, asking for homes, and stating that they have been subject to untold suffering due to the pandemic

On the occasion of World Homeless Day on October 10, urban homeless families living in north Chennai have sent a petition to the Greater Chennai Corporation seeking permanent houses. They claimed they have been subjected to untold suffering during the COVID-19 pandemic.

There are more than 1,800 homeless families living in Royapuram, Parrys and Mannady for the past 60 years. ""The pavements are our refuge, be it under the scorching sun or pouring rain. We do not have any safety, and our children find it hard to study. We have been constantly requesting the government to provide us with houses at the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) tenements in Moolakothalam. But the TNSCB wants 10% contribution from our side -- we are ready to give it, but on an instalment basis,"" said A. Sarasa, one of the petitioners, who lives on Stringer Street.

Many urban homeless persons said that during the pandemic, their families suffered due to lack of food. “We did not have any work. So we had to rely on NGOs that donated food. Besides, we have to use public toilets and we are prone to contracting virus. Already a few pavement dwellers in Egmore have tested COVID-19 positive,” said Leelavathy, residing on Davidson Street.

Rania, another homeless person staying in Ratan Bazaar, said that apart from houses, they also need to be covered under the government insurance scheme. “Some of the residents do not have Aadhar cards and ration cards. Some have not got old age and widow pensions. The government should organise a camp for us,” she said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/urban-homeless-families-want-homes-in-tn-slum-clearance-board-tenements/article32820031.ece
358,2020/10/10,IIT Madras suspends branch change for incoming students,"Students enrolling in the 2020-21 academic year, will not be allowed to change their branches at the end of the first semester, as had been allowed earlier

Students enrolling in the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras this year, may not be able to opt for branches of their choice. IIT Madras officials said its Senate had suspended the “Branch Change at the end of the first semester” for incoming students of the 2020-21 academic year.

The IITs usually allow their students to change their branches based on their CGPA at the end of the first semester.

“Reinstatement of this facility for incoming students in future academic years will be considered once we are able to re-start normal classes and examinations on campus,” the institute said.

The institute said it would permit students of the 2020-21 incoming batch to upgrade to a five-year dual degree (B Tech + M Tech) within their B Tech, discipline or to an interdisciplinary programme in their fourth or fifth semester. “In the IDDD programmes, the M Tech degree is an inter-disciplinary field. At present there are eight IDDD programmes in the fields of advanced nanotechnology; biomedical engineering; computational engineering; data science; energy systems; quantum science and technology; robotics; and tech MBA,” the institute said.

In respect of IIT Delhi, its Director had recently tweeted, “Many JEE Adv qualified candidates are writing to me saying branch change will not be allowed for them. At @iitdelhi over 100 students are allowed to change their branch every year, based on their 1st year performance. We are indeed trying to make this process even more flexible.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/x3sm5d/article32819939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10OCTTH--IIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/iit-madras-suspends-branch-change-for-incoming-students/article32819940.ece
359,2020/10/10,"Savithri Vaithi, founder of Vishranthi Old Age Home, no more","Ms. Vaithi, 90, had suffered a cardiac arrest early on Saturday morning, a member of her family said

Savithri Vaithi, founder of Vishranthi, a home for the elderly, died in Chennai on Saturday. She was 90. Her niece Srilekha said Ms. Vaithi had suffered a cardiac arrest in the early hours of Saturday.

Vaithi, who hailed from a family of judges in Mylapore, was raised in a joint family. She began her journey in social work when she was barely 16. She, along with a group of women, started a charity club. She was the founder president of the Madras Charity Club and of Vishranthi Old Age Home.

“A philanthropist, an activist and a social entrepreneur who provided a safe haven for abandoned women, left us this morning to a safer world. A role model for, and an inspiration to many NGOs in India, we have lost a great soul today,” said Ms. Srilekha.

Kumuda Srinivasan, a long-time associate recalled, “My mother-in-law made me a member of the club for ₹2 a month.” Once, during a discussion with philanthropist Mary Clubwallah Jadhav, the subject of starting an old age home had been mentioned. But it was forgotten as there were concerns about running it. “Then Savithri stood up and said she would do it,” Ms. Srinivasan said.

The journey was fraught with struggles. Nobody took them seriously but Vaithi did not give up. She managed to find a home to house destitute elderly people in 1978. “We used to stand in a queue outside the Hindustan Lever office to collect washing powder for clothes,” Ms. Srinivasan said.

Later, with financial support from Help Age India and a donation of one acre of land from A.V.M. Rajeshwari in Palavakkam, Vishranthi finally found its roots. Vaithi relied on V.S. Natarajan, then a medical student pursuing geriatrics at the Madras Medical College, to help women at the old age home, Ms. Srinivasan said.

Dr. Natarajan recalled the initial discussions at the Government General Hospital. “Three important events took place in 1978. We started a geriatric outpatient ward, Savithri Vaithi was launching an old age home and Indirani Rajadurai became the regional director of Help Age India. I remember the discussions we used to have. At that time, the elderly in the home were all healthy but within a period of five to 10 years, as many as 5-10% of them began suffering health issues – either falls or concussions. I used to conduct geriatric camps for them,” he recalled.

Lakshmi Natarajan, vice president of Madras Charity Club said: “Vishranthi was the first home for the elderly to be started in Chennai. Ms. Vaithi was a pioneer in social work and was one of the first ladies to get public and media attention to focus on the plight of aged women. We have lost a great leader. The loss is not only for us, but for all destitute women. She has done selfless service. With her service-minded ability she has trained all of us to do sustainable service to the needy. We call her Savithri amma. Our Amma has left us all but she will remain in our hearts.”

Ms. Srilekha said the old age home now has 175 residents.

The last rites of Vaithi will be held at Vishranthi between 2 and 3 p.m.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/brb8kv/article32819811.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10OCTTH--SAVITRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/savithri-vaithi-founder-of-vishranthi-old-age-home-no-more/article32819812.ece
360,2020/10/10,Interior roads in Kottivakkam and Palavakkam neglected,"Motorcyclists are at high risk for skidding accidents

Residents of a few neighbourhoods in Kottivakkam and Palavakkam draw attention to how some roads are being allowed to deteriorate through prolonged neglect.

Wear and tear and lack of intervention have led the bitumen topping to come off in some roads, exposing the gravel. With these small stones having loosened up, there is the risk of motorcyclists suffering skidding accidents, residents point out. They want the Greater Chennai Corporation to take up road-relaying work in these areas on a priority basis.

Seemingly high up on the list are: Raja Street at Lakshmana Perumal Nagar in Kottivakkam and Dr. Kalaignar M. Karunanidhi Beach Road in Palavakkam.

According to residents, years ago, a section of Raja Street was dug up for laying metro water pipelines. Though the work got completed, the road was not relaid, they point out.

In addition, at the intersection of Rani Street in Kaveri Nagar and Raja Street in Lakshmana Perumal Nagar wears a battered look, and the condition of the surface makes skidding a dangerous possibility for motorists. Navigate it.

Similarly, the intersection of Fourth Cross Street and Fifth Cross Street at Lakshmana Perumal Nagar and Raja Street needs mending.

“Near the intersection of Raja Street and Karthik Street at Kaveri Nagar in Kottivakkam, the road is uneven due to protruding stones. Therefore, people are using only one half of the road which makes for sluggish vehicular movement,” says G. Aishwarya, a resident of Kottivakkam.

361,2020/10/10,Residents’ forum seeks regular fogging in Perumbakkam,"It says many dengue cases have been reported from the locality

The Federation of Perumbakkam Residents’ Welfare Association has requested the Perumbakkam Village Panchayat to take preventive measures to curb the spread of dengue in Perumbakkam. The Federation is making this request because there has been quite a number of reported dengue cases from the locality.

N. K. Raja, secretary, Federation of Perumbakkam Residents’ Welfare Association, says, “ During May and June, the region witnessed good rains. Days after the rains, the authorities concerned in the Perumbakkam Village Panchayat, took steps to carry out fogging across the region.” Recently, the region witnessed good rains for a couple of days. The Perumbakkam Village Panchayat did not carry out fogging across the region. The mosquitoes have bred in large numbers.” The State Health Department created an awareness programme on prevention of dengue recently in various parts of Perumbakkam. “We request the authorities concerned to carry out fogging across Perumbakkam at periodic intervals,” says N.K.

362,2020/10/10,Kapaleeswarar Nagar residents go to court over SWD work,"They want the Corporation to drop its plan of constructing stormwater drains in their neighbourhood

Kapaleeswarar Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association has filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court seeking a directive against the construction of stormwater drains at Kapaleeswarar Nagar in Neelankarai on East Coast Road. With repeated representations to Greater Chennai Corporation to drop its plan to construct stormwater drains failing to yield results, the Association has resorted to a legal course.

The Greater Chennai Corporation and the German development bank, KfW Development Bank, have proposed to construct stormwater drains in South Chennai at a cost of ₹1,200 crore through East Coast Road connecting Kovalam Basin. Kapaleeswarar Nagar is among the neighbourhoods on East Coast Road that come under the purview of this project.

Residents of Kapaleeswarar Nagar have opposed moves to construct stormwater drains in their locality for the following reasons.

“There is a 23-feet natural downward slope from East Coast Road to the sea which allows for draining of excess flood water. The soil is sandy and hence absorbent. In our representations to GCC, we also pointed out that even during the 2004 tsunami and 2015 floods, there wasn’t waterlogging in our area. In addition, it will be against the interests of rainwater harvesting. Through stormwater drains, rainwater is allowed to go into the sea. But we want to conserve rainwater and thereby recharge the groundwater table. Hence we don’t want stormwater drains for our locality,” says Rohit Menon, secretary, Kapaleeswarar Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association.

Further, the Association has pointed out that there is no site-specific drawing for Kapaleeswar Nagar and therefore contractors will construct the drains according to their convenience.

“In the localities where stormwater drains are constructed, sewage flows through it and pollutes the water-bodies and sea. Funds meant for SWD work can instead be used to provide us with underground sewage drains and piped drinking water supply. We are buying water cans for cooking and drinking purposes. Besides, we spend so much towards cleaning the septic tanks in our houses. As there was no reply from GCC to our requests, we decided to file a writ petition in the Madras High Court,” says Rohit.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/3ftnd5/article32819726.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13DCADYR-STORM-WATER-DRAINS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/kapaleeswarar-nagar-residents-go-to-court-over-swd-work/article32819727.ece
363,2020/10/10,A Saturday cleaning routine,"Residents spruce up Corporation playground in Thiruvanmiyur; official says GCC will take up the work soon

For the past six Saturdays, close to 50 residents of two gated communities — The Atrium and Park View — are cleaning a Greater Chennai Corporation’s playground (Ward 181 — Zone 13 Adyar) at the intersection of Sivasunder Avenue and Kalakshetra Road in Thiruvanmiyur. In addition, they also clean the road around the park. As repeated requests to the Corporation to clean the playground were of no avail, residents have taken it upon themselves to carry out the work.

“With no proper maintenance, the place has become a haven for tipplers. Every morning, we find liquor bottles, food packets, plastic covers and cigarette stubs strewn all over the park. Our colony is losing its serenity. A board hanging at the gate says visitors are not supposed to consume alcohol or smoke cigarettes inside the playground. However, tipplers don’t seem to pay any heed to it,” says M.S. Bharath, a resident of The Atrium who is leading this cleaning exercise.

The volunteers are also persuading their neighbours to patronise the playground.

“Only when more local residents frequent the playground and get the most of it, would deviants hesitate to use it. Earlier, we were cleaning the playground in the early hours of the morning. Now, we purposefully choose to clean the playground in the evening hours, which is from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m every Saturday so that tipplers don’t come. Anyway, they enter the playground after we leave,” says Bharath.

Residents were upset when tree branches were not trimmed properly

“Trees that stand inside the park have branched out onto the roads. They need to be trimmed — both the branches overlooking the road and the ones found within the park. When we informed the Corporation about this, its workers trimmed the branches jutting out and refused to trim the part of the branches of the same tree found inside the park. They said that was the job of the parks department of the Corporation and they were responsible for the ones on the road,” says Bharath.

The 1.5-acre playground was earlier an open space reservation (OSR) land of The Atrium.

“We were maintaining it until 2006 or 2007, after which it had to be handed over to the Greater Chennai Corporation. When the OSR land was with us we were maintaining it well. We planted trees and maintained a garden. But the play equipment was installed by the Corporation.”

Earlier, in December 2015, following the floods, residents came together to clean the playground.

“After that, it is only now that we have taken up such an exercise, which we plan to continue. Further, we will paint the compound walls of the park with artworks hoping passers-by will not relieve themselves on the walls,” says Bharath.

He also pointed out that although the nameboard calls the OSR land a playground, it has swings, slides, and other play equipment meant for smaller children, which are all features of a park.

“Either, it should be provided with facilities apt for a playground or the Greater Chennai Corporation should call it as a park,” says Bharath.

In this respect, a Greater Chennai Corporation official says, “It is not advisable for residents to clean the playground due to COVID-19. Soon, we will take it up and clean the place.”

Bharath also says, “Earlier, the Corporation had entrusted with us one set of keys to the park. But, now as we have cleaned the park, it has got back the keys from us. We had to clean the park because people were having food and we faced the menace of rodents.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-saturday-cleaning-routine/article32819716.ece
364,2020/10/10,‘Water tankers speed through narrow streets’,"Residents of Sarathy Nagar in Velachery have asked CMWSSB to ensure its vehicles stay out of the neighbourhood

A couple of weeks ago, on Sarathy Nagar Main Road in Velachery, Arun Raj heard a dog whimpering, and discovered that it had sustained a head injury. Checking the CCTV footage to find out what had caused the canine harm led him to the moving images of a water tanker, one pressed into service on behalf of the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (CMWSSB).

Arun says, “The footage showed that the driver was driving recklessly, not slowing down even at the turn of the street.”

Madhusudhanan Sampath, another resident, points out that a few days ago, a parked car in one of the streets of Sarathy Nagar missed being hit by a speeding water tanker, by a whisker.

CMWSSB tankers passing via the interior lanes of Sarathy Nagar is a problem that its residents have endured for many years. This March, Sarathy Nagar Residents Welfare Association made a complaint about this continuing menace to the CMWSSB Area Office and Greater Chennai Traffic Police this March.

“CMWSSB officials promised that they would instruct their contractors and drivers about this. The tankers were off out streets for two weeks. By passing through Sarathy Nagar, drivers of water tankers avoid the congested Taramani-Velachery Link Road. The streets in Sarathy Nagar are however narrow, with sharp bends, and hardly meant for water tankers to pass through. Between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. every day, once in 15 minutes, a water tanker passes through Sarathy Nagar,” says Gokhul, secretary of the Association.

Residents point out these tankers ride over stormwater drains and they are likely to get broken anytime.

“Some of the drivers honk raucously and play loud music. When I made a complaint to a CMWSSB official, I was not prepared for the reply I received. He sympathised with the contractors and said that they take the interior lanes to save on fuel. The traffic police have promised to look into the issue, but no action has been taken so far,” says T.K. Kumaravelu, vice-president of the Association.

“Slow in their reflexes, senior citizens taking a walk through the neighbourhood are in danger on account of speeding water tankers. CMWSSB should take measures to stop its vehicles from entering our neighbourhood,” says Hari Priya Ramesh, joint-secretary of the Association.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/1hbkd9/article32819705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11dcadyr-Sarathy-Nagar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/water-tankers-speed-through-narrow-streets/article32819706.ece
365,2020/10/10,"Footpaths come up on road in Besant Nagar, Kalakshetra Colony residents are unimpressed","Residents point out that Greater Chennai Corporation has not delivered on its promise of constructing a pavement with paver blocks

Kalakshetra Colony Welfare Association (KCWA) cannot bring itself to give Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) a pat on the back for promptly executing a part of the footpath project on Tiger Varadachari Road in Besant Nagar. What has come up is a concrete footpath and that is not what the Association had bargained for. KCWA points out that it wanted a footpath made with paver blocks to ensure rainwater percolation.

The Association’s general secretary Shanthi Krishnan says, “Only on the slopes in front of the gates of houses, a concrete surface was necessary. Besides, the slopes near the gate and on the carriageway are longer than they should be. Further, the GCC had promised to keep the Association informed when the work started. We were not informed, and the footpaths were laid overnight.”

Reportedly, on July 20, the Bus Route Road Department of the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) and the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy(ITDP) convened a meeting with Kalakshetra Colony residents to discuss the objectives of the ambitious footpath project. The project is geared to the goals of promoting non-motorised modes of transportation, encouraging walking and ensuring pedestrians’ safety. An ITDP representative is said to have showed examples of safe footpaths that have been laid by GCC in other parts of Chennai, notably those on Raman Street in T. Nagar, Commander-in-Chief Road in Egmore, and Sringeri Mutt Road in Mandaveli.

Shanthi points out that when residents made it clear that they wanted paver blocks to be laid to ensure rainwater percolation, GCC officials accepted the request.

Saucer tiles

Geetha Padmanabhan, a civic activist, says, “When we questioned the workers about the laying of concrete footpaths instead of paver blocks, they replied that the latter would sink. The inter-locking tiles footpath should be stomped in such a way that it does not sink. Besides, the GCC and ITDP officials pointed out that saucer tiles will be laid adjacent to the footpath, which we agreed to. The saucer-tiles will be laid in the area between the footpath and the carriageway. Laying of saucer tiles will ensure smooth passage of rainwater, before it reaches the recharge wells (six to seven recharge wells) on the stretch. The wells will be dug based on the contours of the surface of the carriageway and the flow of the rainwater.” The tiles will keep the curb stones in place and reduce the chances of underground cables getting exposed.

Whenever a need arises for carrying out electrical cable works, the tiles can be removed, and the cable wires put in place.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/h7d8zk/article32819698.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11dcadyrKalakshetra-Road,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/footpaths-come-up-on-road-in-besant-nagar-kalakshetra-colony-residents-are-unimpressed/article32819699.ece
366,2020/10/10,‘No Parking’ warning boards come up across K.P. Nagar,"K.P. Nagar Residents Welfare Association has installed seven ‘No Parking’ boards across five streets at K.P. Nagar in Ramapuram, after successfully seeking permission to do so, from the Ramapuram traffic police and Greater Chennai Corporation.

“We had to come up with this measure to prevent vehicles belonging to non-residents of K.P. Nagar from being parked in our streets. Commercial vehicles such as vans and trucks are parked along our streets most of the time. We have done this with the consent of the Ramapuram traffic police and Zone 11 of Greater Chennai Corporation. We installed these boards in the presence of M. Selvam, Inspector of Police, Traffic, R9 Valasarawakkam Police Station, and Thompson Xavier, Inspector of Police, Law&Order, R11 Rayala Nagar Police Station,” says K. Manoharan, Association president.

As part of this measure, the Association will issue passes to its residents and they are expected to paste their pass on their vehicle.

“We request the traffic police to patrol our street periodically,” says S. Rajendra Rao, vice-president of the Association.

368,2020/10/10,Barricades come up on accident-prone Link Road,"Residents seek installation of street lights; the Poonamallee Municipality cites fund crunch for the delay in installing them

New steel barricades with reflectors have been installed at key intersections on Link Road in Poonamallee to prevent accidents. The local traffic police has come up with this safety measure because many people were driving at a reckless speed as the carriageway is wide. The one-km-long Link Road has been widened and provided with a tiled footpath.

Further, except for the intersections of streets with Link Road, the stormwater drain work has also been completed. The stretch also has a concrete median.

However, residents want installation of street lights at the earliest because accidents occur frequently at the intersections of newly-formed streets with Link Road.

“Street lights have to be installed because stray animals run across the road and motorists are often caught unawares,” says B. Vasanth, a resident of Poonamallee.

The Poonamallee Municipality has to erect lamp posts on the concrete median. However, the installation of street lights is getting delayed purportedly due to funds crunch.

In this respect, a police personnel says, “We are following it up with the Poonamallee Municipality and the State Highways Department. However, steps have been taken to mark zebra-crossings on the intersections of the Link Road and the streets. Unauthorised parking of vehicles on both sides of the stretch, especially at night are being curbed to prevent anti-social activities. Further, a police patrol team has been deployed at the intersection of Link Road and Poonamallee High Road.”

Multi-storey apartment complexes, commercial establishments and a hospital are located along Link Road. As it is off Poonamallee High Road, many use it to reach Porur, St. Thomas Mount, Guindy and Adyar rather than taking other congested roads.

Most of the residents of Link Road work in the factories at Irungattukottai and Sriperumbudur. Besides, a good number of them are employed at DLF IT Park in Ramapuram, around six km from Link Road in Poonamallee.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/8zdltf/article32819510.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11dctngr-Sty-Poonamallee-Barricades-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/barricades-come-up-on-accident-prone-link-road/article32819511.ece
369,2020/10/10,Clogged stormwater drains leave roads waterlogged in K.K. Nagar,"Residents point out that GCC did not have the SWDs desilted in April due to the pandemic

A few days ago, a sudden downpour exposed chinks in the monsoon-preparedness work at K.K. Nagar. A few key roads in K.K. Nagar, including R.K. Shanmugam Salai, Ramanathan Salai, P.T. Rajan Salai and Munuswamy Salai, remained waterlogged due to clogged stormwater drains.

Residents of these neighbourhoods have asked Greater Chennai Corporation to clean and desilt the stormwater drains. They point out that due to the pandemic the routine cleaning during April and July was not carried out.

Besides, they also partly attribute the problem of clogged stormwater drains on some roads to the debris from a SWD-widening work carried out in March before the first lockdown remaining uncleared.

The reduced dimensions of the inlets in these drains is believed to be another reason. According to residents, these inlets are not being cleaned regularly.

Residents are concerned that water-logging could result in mosquito breeding.

Poor illumination

Untrimmed tree branches are said to be blocking the street lamps.

“The trees have not been pruned for many months. Although the key roads are well-laid with wide footpaths, regular maintenance is missing,” says K. Satish, a motorist from Ashok Nagar.

Many prefer to use R.K. Shanmugam Salai and P.T. Rajan Salai as these provide motorists with easy and quick access to T. Nagar, Teynampet, Nandanam, Nungambakkam, Egmore and Mylapore from areas like Virugambakkam, Porur, Valasaravakkam, Kundrathur, Mangadu and Poonamallee.

Moreover, these roads are part of less-congested routes to many other parts of the city. In contrast, Mount– Poonamallee High Road via Guindy and Arcot Road via Vadapalani are marked by bumper-to-bumper traffic during rush hour.

In this respect, a Corporation official says, “Steps will be taken to clean the inlets of the stormwater drains soon.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/i20lyp/article32819502.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11dctngr-KK-Nagar-SWD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/clogged-stormwater-drains-leave-roads-waterlogged-in-kk-nagar/article32819503.ece
370,2020/10/10,Actor Vishnu Vishal’s father booked for allegedly cheating actor Soori,"Soori has accused him and producer Anbuvel Rajan of cheating in a land deal

Actor Vishnu Vishal’s father and former Director General of Police (DGP) Ramesh Kudawla and film producer Anbuvel Rajan have been booked by the city police for allegedly cheating actor Soori to the tune of ₹2 crore over a land deal.

Also read: From Madurai to Chennai, and 13 years later: Soori’s fascinating journey

An FIR was opened by Adyar Police on Thursday against Mr. Kudawla and Mr. Rajan following directions from a metropolitan magistrate court in Saidapet on a petition filed by Mr. Soori.

Mr. Soori and Mr. Vishal have been friends for long since both acted in “Vennila Kabadi Kuzhu”, Kullanari Kootam, Velaynu Vandha Vellakaran and four more films. Mr. Soori and Mr. Kudawla were also well acquainted with each other. Mr. Kudawla was Director-General of Police of Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services and retired from service in June last year.

According to a petition filed by E.Vigneshwaran, Mr. Soori’s personal manager, in 2015, Ramesh approached Mr. Soori to act in “Veera Dheera Suran” as his son would be playing the lead role in the movie produced by AVR productions, owned by Anbuvel Rajan. Mr. Soori had agreed to act on a remuneration of ₹40 lakh for 15 days’ shooting. Later, they changed the production name to Vishnu Vishal Movies and the name of the film changed to “Kadha Nayagan”. Though reshoot was done for 32 days, Mr. Soori claimed he did not receive the payment.

In the course of film shooting, Mr. Soori evinced an interest in buying land and Mr. Ramesh voluntarily came forward to help him and asked his business associate to facilitate the process. He was shown a property of 1.8 acres in Siruseri and Mr. Rajan claimed that he was holding an agreement over the property. Mr. Ramesh himself paid ₹40 lakh as advance for the property, which was the payment of Mr. Soori for acting in the film. Mr. Soori also paid ₹3.15 crore altogether

Only after registration of the property, in 2018, Mr. Soori came to know that the property was not approved as residential property. He claimed he learnt that Mr. Rajan and Mr. Ramesh together had cheated him by misusing their power as agreement holders, the petitioner said.

Mr. Soori’s advocate L.Infant Dinesh said initially they had sent a postal complaint to Adyar Police and other police authorities. “Since there was no response, we approached a metropolitan magistrate court seeking a direction to police register a case. On the orders of court, police registered a case against them on Thursday.”

Mr. Vishal issued a statement denying all allegations against him and his father. He said, “It is so shocking and painful to read such false allegations against me and my father. Obviously, vested interests are working. In fact, Soori has to refund to Vishnu Vishal Studioz an advance paid to him in 2017 for a film “Kavarimaan Parambarai,” which eventually was dropped. We have complete faith in law and judiciary system... (we) will strictly go by what the law permits.”

Sources said the case has been forwarded by Adyar Police to the Central Crime Branch for further investigation.",,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/5qjctt/article30403569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SooriVVV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/actor-vishnu-vishals-father-booked-for-allegedly-cheating-actor-soori/article32818964.ece

376,2020/10/10,The U.S. election just became more uncertain,"Opinion polls could be misleading and the pandemic’s impact difficult to assess; the cyclical shift in politics is unsure

All elections are unpredictable and the American presidential elections are no exception. Yet, such is the power of incumbency that there have been only four occasions since 1900 where a sitting and elected U.S. President has been defeated by his challenger for a second term. The 2020 election was shaping up to be a cliff-hanger when President Donald Trump announced Friday last week that he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19, further darkening the clouds of uncertainty. He returned to the White House after three days of hospitalisation but question marks persist.

One term presidencies

In 1912, Democratic challenger Woodrow Wilson scored a decisive victory over President William Howard Taft, seeking his second term. However, the reason was a divided Republican vote. President Theodore Roosevelt, the U.S. President from 1901 to 1909, had supported Taft for his first term. Subsequently, he got disenchanted and eventually split the Republican party, running as the candidate of the newly established progressive party, and coming second in the race. Taft, already weakened with the infighting in the Republican party, emerged a distant third.

The second one-term President was Herbert Hoover, defeated in a landslide victory by his Democratic challenger Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. This election was fought against the backdrop of the Great Depression. Roosevelt won on the promise of the New Deal and then went on to win in 1936, 1940 and 1944. By the time he began his fourth term in January 1945, he was already suffering from high blood pressure and congestive heart disease and died three months later. Till then, there was no restriction on the number of terms for President; the two-term limit was introduced with the 22nd constitutional amendment in 1951.

In 1976, Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter defeated President Gerald Ford who had taken over the presidency in 1974 after President Nixon resigned when faced with the threat of impeachment. He had earlier been appointed (not elected) Vice-President in 1973 after Vice-President Spiro Agnew resigned. In U.S. history, Ford is the only one to have held both positions of Vice-President and President without having won an election to either.

The 1970s was a decade marked by an energy crisis sparked by oil price hikes, high inflation, economic downturn and rising unemployment. The U.S. Embassy hostage crisis in Tehran in 1979 following the Islamic revolution in Iran became emblematic of eroding confidence among the people that made it easier for Republican challenger Ronald Reagan to trounce Democratic incumbent President Jimmy Carter in 1980. The Democratic party was already polarised as Senator Ted Kennedy had challenged President Carter in the party primaries.

Both 1932 and 1980 also marked deeper power shifts; in 1932, the Democrats took back Congress continuing till the 1950s, introducing social security; the 1980s saw the return of the Republicans with promises of tax cuts and supply side economics.

The last one term President in the 20th century was George H.W. Bush who had won easily in 1988 after being Reagan’s Vice-President for eight years. He lost his re-election bid to rank newcomer, Democratic challenger Bill Clinton in 1992 despite having notched up a series of foreign policy successes during the first term — Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan followed by the unification of Germany and the break-up of the Soviet Union. “It’s the economy, stupid”, became the catchphrase of the successful Clinton campaign.

Unresolved questions

The handling of the COVID-19 pandemic was going to be an issue but Mr. Trump testing positive raised a bunch of fresh questions: about implications for continuity for government, and, for the election campaign leading to polling on November 3 and its follow-through till the winner takes office on January 20, 2021.

Also Read Amid concerns, Donald Trump may campaign on October 10

Presidential succession to ensure continuity of government was addressed in the Presidential Succession Act (1947) and the 25th Constitutional Amendment (1967), triggered by the assassination of President J.F. Kennedy in 1963. In case a President dies, resigns or is otherwise incapacitated, the succession moves to the Vice-President, and then on to the Speaker of the House, the President pro tempore of the Senate and the members of the Cabinet beginning with the Secretary of the State.

Campaign continuity is more uncertain. Elections are held every four years in November on the Tuesday after the first Monday of the month. Changing the date would need bipartisan consensus, hardly likely when the country is in the throes of a campaign. This year, the popular election on November 3 will be followed by the 538-member Electoral College voting on December 14. Congress will certify the Electoral College vote on January 6, 2021 officially declaring the President (and the Vice-President) who will assume office at the inauguration on January 20. During this, when exactly does the winning candidate become “President-elect” is a question on which legal experts still differ.

There is no legal guidance in case a candidate dies or is unable to campaign shortly before the November polling or any time thereafter. For 2020, in any event, the ballot papers are already printed and millions of postal ballots were cast when the question surfaced.

Were a vacancy to arise after November 3, the Electoral College will be guided by the two political parties since the primaries process of anointing candidates is their jealously guarded preserve. Under the circumstances they may just find it expedient to bump up the Vice-President to fill the presidential slot but how the Vice-President’s slot will then be filled remains uncertain.

Tight race or landslide

How will this uncertainty play out in 2020? Mr. Trump returned to the White House on October 5 and two days later was back in the Oval Office, announcing that he had recovered fully. Doctors described the cocktail of drugs administered to the President as an experimental therapeutic.

Mr. Trump has refused to participate in any virtual TV debates with Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice-President, a decision announced by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates after Mr. Trump tested positive. The first TV debate had been variously described as “chaotic”, “a **** show” and a “wrestling bout in a mud-pit”, none an edifying label.

U.S. Presidential polls | Trump campaign proposes new debate dates; Biden team rejects

More than once, Mr. Trump expressed scepticism about the integrity of postal balloting, warning that the issue would have to be decided by the Supreme Court. When asked about a peaceful transition of power, he generated controversy with, “we are going to have to see what happens”. This is one reason that Mr. Trump is keen to push through the appointment of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court to replace late Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, widely seen as a moderate and a liberal voice.

Earlier, ratification of federal judicial appointments was approved not by a simple majority but a larger (filibuster proof) majority of 60. This invariably meant getting support from across party aisles. However, growing polarisation and politicisation of judicial appointments in recent decades often led to prolonged impasses and nominations had to be withdrawn. In 2013, then Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid worked out a deal to permit judicial appointments for Circuit and Appeal Courts to be cleared by a simple majority of 51. It boomeranged when the Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell employed the same ‘nuclear option’ to approve the appointment of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court in 2017 and is threatening to use it again.

Surveys and reality

In all four instances of single term presidencies, the challenger won a decisive victory and in three instances, a landslide victory. Most opinion polls indicate a lead (not landslide) for Mr. Biden but polls can be notoriously misleading; even in 2016, Hillary Clinton led in the polls even winning more popular votes but losing the electoral college.

It is also impossible to predict whether the pandemic will catalyse a cyclical shift seen in 1932 and 1980. Just as there are old-time Republicans who wish they had another candidate instead of Mr. Trump, many staunch Democrats wonder whether Mr. Biden will be sufficiently committed to their progressive agenda. Which party is more fractured internally remains speculative.

Amid the growing uncertainty, only a decisive victory on November 3 will show that U.S. democracy has developed immunity from COVID-19.

The passing of Dalit icon and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan comes at a time when India has been deeply stunned by the Hathras tragedy, which includes the victim’s cremation by the state in a midnight shocker. As a Dalit leader, he was at the forefront in issues concerning Dalits, the Backward Classes and minorities. He was the voice of aspirational Dalits and a tall leader in his right (Page 1, “Ram Vilas Paswan passes away”, October 9).

Mr. Paswan’s passing is a loss not only to politics but also to those who are marginalised. The nation has lost a pillar of social activism and an icon who fought for the downtrodden.

R. Karthikeyan,

His long political career is marked by alliances with almost all the political parties that have governed the nation. In a tough profession, and in the case of Mr. Paswan, which also required great adjustment with a variety of ideologies of heads of governments, he emerged successful as a central Cabinet Minister without inviting adversity from any quarter.

Blurred lines

It is for a proper, transparent and fair investigation to decide if TV channels are involved in a TRP racket (Inside pages, “3 channels in TRP racket, say police”, October 9). But one thing is clear — electronic media anchors and reporters are crossing their limits. The press is the fourth pillar of democracy and is expected to be impartial and report correctly. But TV channels are busy sensationalising news. It has reached a stage in India where one can easily brand the political affiliation of a TV news channel by watching it for a few minutes. There is a need to overhaul the system so that people’s faith in the media is not shaken. The judiciary may have to settle this issue.

Tamil Nadu politics

A truce may have been called in the battle royal between the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Edappadi K. Palaniswami, and the Deputy Chief Minister, but there are so many external factors at play. It is for voters to decide whether they want a glow or gloom in 2021. Another cardinal point to be noted is that if the ‘united front’ faces a drubbing at the hustings in 2021 and the major Opposition emerges victorious, one wonders what will be in store for the ruling party. Incidentally, there seems to be no real abatement of COVID-19 in the State; will this be a factor too in the election?

378,2020/10/10,Shrinking spaces for winged visitors a cause for concern,"On World Migratory Bird Day, environmentalists and experts say habitat for flamingos and wetland birds has shrunk to 20% of what it was

On World Migratory Bird Day on Saturday, experts from Mumbai came together to discuss ways to protect lesser flamingos.

They said four decades ago, conditions were ideal for flamingos to visit the city but today they are being forced to feed within a tiny piece of land owing to the continuous destruction of wetlands and development activities across many areas.

A webinar titled, ‘The Flight of the Pink - How can Mumbai protect the lesser flamingoes’ was organised as a part of the ‘Biodiversity by the Bay’ campaign, initiated by Ministry of Mumbai’s Magic — a citizen’s collective comprising Mumbaikars who wish to bring the issue of protecting biodiversity to the forefront.

Speaking on ways to protect the iconic bird and the wetlands where they feed in Mumbai, Stalin Dayanand, Director of Projects, Vanashakti, said, “After the loss of 2,000 hectares of wetlands for the Navi Mumbai International Airport and JNPT expansions, the habitat for flamingos and wetland birds has shrunk to 20% of what it was. The Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary is the last refuge for 1.5 lakh birds which concentrate here now. It is an important bird area that needs all the mangroves, grasslands, water bodies, rocky areas of the creek in contiguity with the sanctuary to be added to the sanctuary. Presently, more than 60% of the habitat has been kept out of the sanctuary limits obviously to help real estate and other projects later on. The ESZ notification status won’t protect it like a sanctuary can.”

Other experts in the webinar included Bahar Dutt, award-winning environment journalist; Ashima Narain, wildlife filmmaker; Virendra Tiwari, CCF and Head of Mangrove Cell; and Ritwick Dutta from Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment.

The group also discussed how wetlands at Uran used to be a flamingo hotspot, which has been reclaimed to make way for a new airport. The ongoing construction of the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link — a 22km sea bridge — cuts across mangroves and mudflats to Navi Mumbai. This means no large flocking of flamingos at Sewri bay, which lies between Thane Creek and the Arabian Sea.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ax9wd3/article32823833.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BMFlamingo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/shrinking-spaces-for-winged-visitors-a-cause-for-concern/article32823834.ece

The State government in a notification dated May 21 and August 31 had fixed the rates for COVID-19 treatment in private hospitals on a case-by-case basis. NMMC chief Abhijit Bangar had issued notices to healthcare providers in his jurisdiction, warning them of legal action under Section 3 of the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Act, 1897, and Sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, in case of discrepancies in bills.

381,2020/10/10,"We need community-based mental health services, says Dr. Soumitra Pathare","The psychiatrist says there is a need to modify a host of laws that discriminate against people with mental health issues

On World Mental Health Day, Dr. Soumitra Pathare, a consultant psychiatrist and director of the Centre for Mental Health Law & Policy at Indian Law Society in Pune, speaks to The Hindu on how society and laws discriminate against people with mental health issues and the need to stop treating them as second class citizens.

Why is it important to have a Mental Health Day?

All the issues attached to mental health are a 365-day affair. But it is important to at least have an annual reminder that we need to pay attention to mental health issues. The data shows that one out of six or seven people in the world have a mental health problem or illness. So it is one day when people try to get over the stigma around it and reluctance to talk about it. It is a good day to introspect on why and how we discriminate against people with mental health issues and treat them like second class citizens. We need to ask ourselves and the governments this question and why this is allowed to continue even in 2020.

Do you think over the years awareness has increased?

Awareness has never been a problem. It is not like people don’t not know of mental health problems. The issue is that there is stigma and discrimination attached to mental health. As a society we very actively and freely discriminate against those who have mental health problems.

How would you explain discrimination and stigma?

Stigma is only an attitude and discrimination is actively behavioural. People discriminate, which has an impact on your life. What anyone thinks about you does not necessarily affect you, but how one behaves with you affects you. That is discrimination. It is active discrimination which makes people’s lives miserable.

Can you give an example of how people are discriminated on the basis of mental health?

Our society discriminates and our government discriminates. If you look at the laws. Our marriage laws, whether it is the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, or the Special Marriage Act, 1954, if you have a mental illness, then it is a ground for divorce. If mental illness is a health issue, then why is one health problem a ground for divorce and not one other health problem? Even HIV is not a ground for divorce. What a law like this says is if the State can discriminate then it is alright for everyone to discriminate. So that goes on to say that they are lesser human beings and they have lesser rights. There are so many cases of employment – where there is no protection from unfair dismissal if you have a health problem.

What are the other laws that discriminate?

There is a need to look at laws that actively and passively discriminate. There is a host of laws that definitely need to be modified. For example, in the Representation of the People Act, 1951, with respect to voting. Why should somebody with a mental health problem be denied voting? The government will say ‘mental illness’ is not mentioned in the Act and the legislation says with an ‘unsound mind’. However, electoral officers across the country have interpreted that ‘unsound mind’ means mental illness. There is a clear need to clarify that. In the Hindu marriage Act, it is very interesting that when the Act was amended, ‘leprosy’ was removed from it. We got rid of ‘epilepsy’ from the Act almost 20 years ago. However, mental illness still figures in it. Over time, leprosy and epilepsy have been deleted from the law but mental illness still figures in it. It is a discriminatory provision that needs to be removed.

What steps should the government take to handle mental health issues?

There is a need for more services which are acceptable to people. We need to provide community-based mental health services and not large asylums. The world over, what we have seen is that people want community-based mental health services as they are more effective and less costly. Services need to be nearer to people’s homes so that they can continue to get those services. Very few people require long-term institutional care and that needs to be provided in the community-based services. There is no use in building large hospitals with many beds if the government is not going to help people with mental health problems and recovery.

How much of the government’s budget is allocated to mental health?

Simple statistics show that less than 1% of the health budget goes towards mental health. While there is enough data to show that mental health issues constitute 8-10% of the health burden, we do not have enough mental health professionals.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/j4by04/article32823112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BMSoumitra-Pathare,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/we-need-community-based-mental-health-services/article32823113.ece

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Friday said he was ready to go behind bars to protect the interests and rights of the people of the Union Territory.

Addressing a press conference, the Chief Minister said he had made the remarks about attempts by the Union Government to merge the Union Territory (U.T.) with Tamil Nadu, in the context of various decisions made by the Centre recently.

“The Centre is trying to grab the powers of the U.T. government in a phased manner. I made the remark that the Centre was trying to merge the U.T. with Tamil Nadu, in this context,” he said.

To substantiate his charge against the Centre, the Chief Minister said that the Union Home Ministry delayed giving sanction for presenting the U.T.’s budget, by about four months. The territorial administration wanted to provide rice, but on the basis of the Lieutenant Governor’s advice, the Centre directed the government to deposit the money in the accounts of the beneficiaries. Again, the government wanted to provide clothes to the poor during Deepavali, but on the Lt. Governor’s advice, the Centre directed the administration to transfer money to the needy, the Chief Minister said.

The U.T.’s administration has full powers with respect to decisions on land issues, but the government was denied the right to sell land belonging to Anglo French Textiles to compensate the mill workers, he said.

“Following my statement against the Centre, some people in the U.T. wanedt me to be arrested for indulging in ‘anti-national’ activities. Some are taking out processions demanding that a case be registered against me for indulging in such activity. Now, it has become a practice for the BJP government to register cases on anti-national charges and use law enforcement agencies such as the CBI, I-T and ED against Opposition leaders in the country. I am ready to go to jail to protect the rights of the people and of the U.T. Do not try to scare us with such threats,” he said.

Opposition parties in Puducherry have been “sleeping” while the Centre and the Lt. Governor have been meddling with the affairs of the U.T., he said.

“The rights of the people of the U.T. are being taken away. The Centre and the Lt. Governor are trying to block welfare and development schemes.

386,2020/10/10,371 new cases recorded in Puducherry,"Two more fatalities take the toll in the Union Territory to 558 even as the tally touches 30,904

PUDUCHERRY Puducherry recorded 371 new COVID-19 cases and two deaths on Friday. The capital accounted for both the fatalities — that of a 73-year-old woman and a 46-year-old man.

The Union Territory’s toll touched 558, with Puducherry accounting for 463 deaths, followed by Karaikal (49), Yanam (42) and Mahe (four).

A total of 5,006 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours. The Puducherry region accounted for 287 cases, Karaikal 53, Yanam 8 and Mahe 23.

The positivity rate stood at 7.41%, case fatality rate at 1.81% and recovery rate at 82.65%.

The Union Territory has so far recorded 558 deaths. It currently has 4,803 active cases and its tally has touched 30,904. A total of 25,543 patients have recovered. Of the 2.25 lakh samples tested so far, 1.90 lakh have returned negative.

Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao told mediapersons that more health workers would be trained on early detection of symptomatic cases to monitor the increasing number of patients under home quarantine, better.

“We have been able to contain the number of COVID-19 deaths, but we need to reduce it further,” he said.

The Minister said that he would raise the need for arranging a function to honour the efforts of all categories of health staff, from specialists to cleaning staff, at the Cabinet meeting on Monday. For the last seven months, they had been working without a break and it was only right to acknowledge their efforts with a certificate or memento, he said.

Puducherry’s financial crisis was standing in the way of sanctioning cash incentives for the staff, he said. “We can think of granting monetary incentives only when the financial situation improves,” he said.

While Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy is due to visit Karaikal on Saturday, the Health Minister is scheduled to visit Mahe next week to take stock of the augmentation of infrastructure there, especially in the context of a spurt in COVID-19 cases in Kerala, of late.

390,2020/10/10,Residents demand proper maintenance of Mavadikulam,"‘Waste water contaminates the lake and garbage is dumped into it’

A section of residents and activists staged a protest on Saturday demanding proper maintenance and development of the Mavadikulam in Ponmalai.

The residents alleged that the waterbody has not been desilted properly. “Waste water coming from residences and commercial establishments across Ponmalai is contaminating the lake. Garbage is dumped into the lake. If the authorities want to improve the lake, they must first ensure that the water is not contaminated,” said K. Sathish Kumar, joint secretary of Thanneer, a voluntary organisation.

The lake used to be a sanctuary for migratory birds but many species did not return after 2017 due to the state of the lake, Mr. Satish claimed. “Although we often mobilise volunteers and students to clean the lake, the rate at which it was being contaminated is much higher,” he said.

The protesters said desilting should be done properly. Otherwise, they would stage protests on a bigger scale.

According to the proposal drawn up by the Public Works Department, the lake bund is to be strengthened. A walkway and a road would be laid around the lake. A bathing ghat and seating arrangements and four mounds for birds to perch have been planned. The authorities claim that the waterbody was desilted before the work on the facilities began.

“We get requests to allow boating and other entertainment features. However, Mavadikulam is primarily used as an irrigation channel and we would like to preserve it this way. People can walk around it and take in its beauty,” an Assistant Engineer of the PWD from Chennai who has been assigned to monitor the work said. The mounds will have saplings, specially brought from the Agriculture department for this purpose so that birds can nest on them, the official said.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/f2pynr/article32825977.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TY-CITY-MAAVADIKULAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/maintain-mavadikulam-properly-say-residents/article32822423.ece

392,2020/10/10,"Chandrakala and Suryakala, Thanjavur’s sweet offerings","This innovation by Guru Dayal, the late owner of Bombay Sweets, combines the best of north and south cuisines

BG Subramani Sharma, managing director of Bombay Sweets, smiles when he answers a question on when he entered the business in Thanjavur. “I started assisting my father Guru Dayal Sharma when I was in Class XI, mainly with measuring out the ingredients and learning how to knead the dough for samosa. I was nicknamed maida maavu by my classmates because I would come to school straight from the kitchen with flour on my hands,” he says.

There is a hum of activity at this 10,000 square-feet industrial kitchen complex in Thanjavur, even though lockdown restrictions have mandated a reduced staff strength. Teams of men and women are preparing a host of snacks and savouries that will be displayed and sold at the store’s 14 branches in Thanjavur and Pattukottai.

Clearly, it’s been a long journey, from a small tuck shop opposite Thanjavur railway station in 1949 to an e-commerce savvy business today.

“My father was a traditional sweet maker in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, who migrated down South in the 1940s, and after working for a short while in Chennai, settled down in Thanjavur. He was a master chef who believed in using the best ingredients,” says Sharma. “He loved every step of cooking — he would begin his day listening to Surdas bhajans while slicing cashew nuts. He remained as enthused about his work in his later years, as when he was starting out.”

Since 1949, Bombay Sweets (named so by Sharma Senior because the city symbolised sophistication and novelty to him, even though he had never actually been there), is a favourite snack food destination for both local residents and tourists in Thanjavur. While the original menu has expanded from North Indian snacks to include Southern Indian tiffin items and fast food, its best-sellers are the sweets Chandrakala and Suryakala, a Guru Dayal innovation that combines the best of north and south festive cuisines.

These are little fried pastry parcels filled with khoya or mawa (whole dried milk) mixed with nuts and seasoned delicately with saffron and cardamom powder, then dipped in a light sugar syrup.

“For this recipe, my father was inspired by the gujiya, a dry fried pastry that is commonly prepared for festivals like Holi in the North. Chandrakala and suryakala, both of which have the same filling, get a south Indian twist with a brief dip in hot sugar syrup at the very end,” says Subramani.

Around 250 kilos of Chandrarkala are made per day during lockdown.

Their name derives from their shape — Chandrakala looks like a crescent moon, while the Suryakala is round, like the sun. Due to the lockdown, Suryakala is made only during the weekends, while three varieties of Chandrakala – regular, ghee and almond filling — are churned out from Monday to Friday.

Where possible, machines like paddle mixers and dough extruders help to streamline the production process in Bombay Sweets. For the Chandrakala preparation, a heavy-duty mixer kneads maida and water into a silky dough that is then passed through a mechanical cutter which forms equal sized portions for rolling out.

Workers then sit in assembly-line fashion to break down the task of rolling out, filling, and then delicately folding the edges of the pastry discs by hand.

Another team of cooks supervising huge oil-filled pans is on hand to fry the Chandrakala. The flame is kept on medium heat, to ensure that both the casing and filling are well-cooked.

The parcels are turned constantly with slotted spoons in the hot oil, and once drained, the fried pastry is passed on to the next team overseeing the sugar syrup.

The Chandrakala pockets are removed as soon as the fluted edges look glazed. “If this step gets delayed, you can end up with soggy Chandrakala, so the cooks have to be very careful,” says Subramani Sharma.

We get to sample a Chandrakala fresh from the kitchen. The crisp pastry and soft filling get a low sugar kick from the syrup, making it an ideal teatime snack.

With footfalls at restaurants reducing due to the lockdown, Bombay Sweets has started offering pre-packaged snack combinations for both online and offline sales.

“As the festive season is set to begin, and due to the improvement in delivery logistics, we have decided to reach out to Indian customers through our website. We also get many orders from Thanjavur residents living abroad,” says Subramani Sharma.

The demand for Chandrakala and Suryakala has grown with the new mini versions that are ideal for gifting.

Subramani Sharma has catalogued all the recipes that are being used by Bombay Sweets, and hopes the family’s forthcoming generations will develop the patriarch Guru Dayal Sharma’s vision further.

“Even at the age of 52, I miss my father, who passed away in 1991. His career in Thanjavur alone lasted 50 years. Though the branches have grown since his demise, at the end of the day, Bombay Sweets is the tree that he planted. And Chandrakala and Suryakala are fine examples of his creativity,” he says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/rn2kzn/article32818868.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY06SWEETTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/chandrakala-and-suryakala-thanjavurs-sweet-offerings/article32818869.ece
393,2020/10/10,WC qualifiers | Easy day at the office for Brazil against Bolivia,"Colombia hardly breaks a sweat in blanking Venezuela

Brazil and Colombia had no trouble beating two of the weakest South American teams to score their first wins in the opening round of World Cup qualifiers.

The matches took place without fans due to health protocols from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Brazil easily beat Bolivia 5-0 in rainy Sao Paulo while Colombia scored all of its goals in a 3-0 victory in the first half in Barranquilla.

After the first round, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and Argentina lead with three points. Peru and Paraguay have one. Ecuador, Chile, Venezuela and Bolivia have none.

Defender Marquinhos opened the scoring in the 16th minute with a header. Roberto Firmino netted the first of his two goals in the 30th minute, just pushing the ball into an empty goal after a low cross from Renan Lodi.

Firmino made it 3-0 in the 49th minute, assisted by Neymar, putting the ball between the legs of goalkeeper Carlos Lampe. Then 19-year-old striker Rodrygo scored his first for the national team with a header in the 66th.

Philippe Coutinho ended the rout in the 73rd minute with a header, also assisted by Neymar.

Bolivia left some of its players in La Paz, looking towards the clash against Argentina at altitude.

The team is in crisis due to a political dispute involving the country’s soccer body and major teams.

Serious injury

The match in Barranquilla was marked by a serious left-ankle injury to Colombian defender Santiago Arias after he tackled Venezuelan striker Darwin Machis in the first few minutes.

401,2020/10/10,Torchlight walk at Pavurallakonda on Saturday,"It is aimed at creating awareness about the Buddhist site

Heritage conservationists and enthusiasts and citizens concerned will take up a torchlight walk at 2000-year-old Buddhist site Pavurallakonda, here on Saturday. The walk will be led by heritage narrator and INTACH member Jayashree Hattangadi.

Speaking to The Hindu, she said that the ancient site is being misused by many and it is time that people understand the importance of the site.

This is a 3rd Century BC Buddhist site and was a Buddhist monastery along with Thotlakonda and Bavikonda, but people have been going on bikes and littering the sites with empty alcohol bottles and other things.

Since there is no gate protecting the entry to the sites, people are driving up to the protected area, and it needs to be stopped, she said.

According to heritage enthusiast and environment activist Sohan Hattangadi, a request was made to the Department of Archaeology to build a gate at the foothills, to restrict the entry and free flow of traffic, but it is still to materialise.

“Since it was taking some time, we volunteered to build a gate, but that proposal is pending approval from the higher-ups,” he said.

Pavurallakonda is located near Bheemunipatnam and flourished as Buddhist monastic complex from 3rd century BC to 2nd century AD.

It is one of the largest hilltop Buddhist monasteries in this part of Coastal A.P. And initial excavations had revealed a number of relics and evidences suggesting that viharas, stupas, meditation halls and circular chaityas were part of the monastery.

The basic idea is to create an awareness about the site and why it needs to be preserved and conserved, said Mr. Sohan.

According to the GVMC officials, almost 80% of the works have been completed. Last year, there was some delay due to various reasons and again in this year, the project has suffered due to COVID-19 situation. But since the last few weeks, the works have been going on in full swing.

“The trial run might start after 15th of this month. With some more weeks of work, 90% of the project will be completed. The plan is to bring it for public use before the end of this year,” Executive Engineer, Smart City works, V. Sudhakar said..

It may be remembered that on January 9, 2019, the ‘bhoomi puja’ for the project was conducted. The G+5 MLCP project is being taken up by a Pune-based private company with a budget of ₹9.7 crore near Jagadamba Junction.

The facility, which is completely computerised and mechanical, can accommodate 100 cars, as per the Smart City wing officials.

According to a senior official from the GVMC, had the project gone as per the plan, it would have been completed on time, last year. After the change in government and several issues, it got delayed for over one-year.

Officials from the traffic police wing say that once the project is completed, traffic problems being faced due to the unauthorised parking of four-wheelers in the lanes of Jagadamba Junction are likely to be solved.

“A number of four-wheelers are being towed away due to unauthorised parking. With many hospitals and commercial establishments in the area and many still lacking cellars, MLCP project will come in handy for car owners,” said a police officer.",,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/2uy453/article32817049.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-VZ-CARPARKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/multi-level-car-parking-project-works-pick-up-pace-in-city/article32817050.ece
406,2020/10/10,Eat lead: S. Hussain Zaidi’s ‘The Endgame’ reviewed by Zac O’Yeah,"Tinsel town tropes and long lectures aside, this is a solidly crafted thriller that gives a sneak peek into the workings of the intelligence services

In downtown Mumbai, audacious terrorists strike in broad daylight. Right in front of the security forces, a VIP — namely the SPG of BSF (don’t ask me what that means but let’s suppose it’s something army-related) — gets assassinated, his motorcade is bombed, and there’s immense collateral damage.

Despite the assault being meticulously planned and cleverly orchestrated, ostensibly by some foreign hand or the other, investigators Vikrant Singh and his mentor Shahwaz Ali Mirza, who are deputed from RAW to file a report on the case, sense there’s something fishily amateurish about the random shooting and the crude bomb.

The suicide attackers turn out to be regular sons of the soil and evidence points towards the involvement of a home-grown sleeper cell.

It’s their worst nightmare come true. But as Mumbai police flashes a red alert and ex post facto safety measures are taken, the investigating team begins to suspect a link between the SPG’s killing and a hit-and-run accident a week earlier, in which an ex-PM was severely maimed. Unfortunately, the politician is in coma and can’t shed light on matters.

Delightful twists

The conspiracy soon appears way bigger than expected and the foreign hand behind it turns out to belong not to Pakistan’s ISI but the West Asian ISIS. A socially conscious cop, Ashok Mankame, who is drafted by the investigators to help out with legwork, has a meltdown and delivers a Bollywoodish speech, “…this is definitely not my fucking world. My world is finding angry teenagers checking out ISIS websites and scaring them by showing them videos of the terrible deaths that they could die in Syria.”

Despite such didactic elements that pop up as and when the author gets the urge to lecture, and time-tested tinsel-town tropes like estranged brothers, this book is, broadly speaking, a solidly crafted thriller with several delightfully unanticipated twists. An interesting touch is saintly social worker Rehmat Khan, an informant who turns out to have many strings to her bow.

Another is a Hebrew killing machine on loan from Mossad whose name Ben Solo puns on a Star Wars character and who, being invincibly proactive, gets credit for much of the coolest action, while the more realistically portrayed Indian intelligence officers mostly stare at a whiteboard in a safehouse while fiddling with their smartphones, waiting for something to happen. Until one of them, in a comic relief moment of sorts, puts a syringe in the foreigner’s neck to prevent him from hogging their limelight.

The Endgame distinguishes itself from run-of-the-mill pulp by its deep insights into the factual matters that the plot builds on, no doubt due to the author’s credentials. Hussain Zaidi is a well-known name in Indian tabloid journalism, whose work has inspired movies and Netflix shows, whilst his non-fiction bestsellers like Mafia Queens of Mumbai are landmarks in the domestic true-crime genre.

This results in an impression of authenticity, of actually getting a peek at what’s hidden behind the smoke and mirrors of the intelligence services, further enhanced by the alphabet soup of acronyms facing us on every page, like NIA, CIA, IB, NSG, DCP, DSG, ATS, etc.

Edifying content

Unfortunately, though Mumbai usually provides an unparalleled backdrop to any novel, here it is represented only by place names such as Mira Road, Goregaon-Dahisar belt, and Mumbra, geotags that don’t bring the milieus alive for anybody who doesn’t know the city beyond Colaba and Bandra. Pretty much the only local colour in the entire book is a single cup of “cutting chai” ingested during a stakeout.

The journalistic spirit further hampers the raciness of an otherwise taut narrative when Zaidi is unable to mute the impulse to provide readers with heavy-handed explanations as well as backstory info-dumps, stuff that ought to be woven into the novel’s fabric.

On the other hand, this edifying content is, well, very edifying. The book is written along the lines of other recent works of “faction” — thinly veiled issue-focused essayistic fiction — in which authors provide scenarios around devastating events that might just befall us in these strange times: such as Sidin Vadukut’s Bombay Fever, which prophesied a pandemic breakout in Mumbai, Amitav Ghosh’s Gun Island that dealt with climate catastrophes, even ex-POTUS Bill Clinton’s debut thriller, The President is Missing, which discussed cyberterrorism targeting the Internet of Things and how it might potentially result in a complete shutdown of the American lifestyle.

Many important ideas to mull, even if Zaidi’s novel in the end feels like a cinematic treatment awaiting a director and suitable actors to blow life into its protagonists and antagonists.

407,2020/10/10,Arun Kolatkar in Chennai,"Improbably enough, Arun Kolatkar once lived briefly in Madras, painting and hawking clay pots between 1955 and 1957

Any mention of Arun Kolatkar (1931-2004) would bring to mind the image of a man with drooping moustache and unkempt hair smoking away on Thursday afternoons at Wayside Inn in Kala Ghoda, Mumbai, waiting for his friends. Mumbai apart, places that one would associate with modern India’s most elusive bilingual poet would be his hometown Kolhapur; Jejuri, the pilgrim town and title of his most famous book; and Pune, where he died, in pain, of stomach cancer. Not by a long shot would anyone link him with Chennai. Strangely enough, between 1955 and 1957, Kolatkar, still a young poet trying to find a voice in both English and Marathi, lived in Madras, as Chennai was called in those days.

Some years after Kolatkar’s death, his first wife Darshan Ladhamal Chhabda sent Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, the poet, literary historiographer and Kolatkar’s great admirer, two plastic folders. Forty years after their divorce, Darshan’s fascination for Kolatkar had not dimmed. The folders contained letters, notes, draft poems and sketches that had passed between the two. But Darshan had prohibited their publication in any form during her lifetime and for some years later; she died in 2011.

Life together

About as fastidious as Kolatkar, Mehrotra edited the letters with annotations, structuring it as an essay. Titled ‘I Love You, Idiot’, it was published in his Translating the Indian Past and Other Literary Histories (Permanent Black, 2019). It is from this essay that we know of his time in Chennai. In one letter Kolatkar says, “At least 27 letters I must have sent you since you left [Chennai]. How many did you receive?” Only four have survived, all dating to April-May 1957, towards the end of his stay.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

Born in Kolhapur, Kolatkar matriculated from Bombay University and later joined J.J. School of Art, Mumbai, only to discontinue after a year. In the summer of 1953, he met Darshan and they married early next year despite disapproval from both families. Kolatkar’s was middle-class Brahmin while Darshan came from an affluent Punjabi family with connections to the film world. Kolatkar did not have a job: in fact, in sheer desperation, he even applied for a peon’s job in a newspaper. Then, thanks to M.F. Husain, he took up the painting of wooden toys.

Soon, however, sometime in 1955, Kolatkar and Darshan moved to Chennai. The young couple had probably fled an inhospitable situation resulting from their inter-caste and inter-class marriage. Having hopped from one lodge to another the previous year, this was the first time they led a settled life together and it was possibly their happiest. But it would also appear that Darshan was away for considerable amounts of time or there would have been no letters. They lived on Madley Road — the road connecting West (Old) Mambalam and New Mambalam, as T. Nagar was called then.

Versatile illustrator

Their house must have likely been a modest one. What is now the T. Nagar bus terminus was then a pond. Kolatkar would have taken the suburban electric train often. According to Mehrotra, Kolatkar painted clay pots to be sold on the streets. He could not have made much selling them. In April 1956 he applied for a position as assistant artist in the Ground Training School at the Tambaram Air Force Station, evidently without success. He learnt Morse code but could not find a job as a telegraph operator. It was probably the small monthly allowance remitted by Darshan’s mother that helped them out.

Painting clay pots and hawking them was not the only thing occupying Kolatkar. These were productive years. He met the painter Krishen Khanna, who had probably come to Chennai in his job as a banker, and passed on his poems in typescript. These were Early Poems, 1953-55 (a manuscript that, sadly, is forever forthcoming). He also met Shanti Dave of the Baroda School at this time. Kolatkar was an artist himself — in one letter, he refers to himself as a “versatile illustrator” — and the letters to Darshan are full of drawings and doodles. In one letter he asks for “a spray gun for finer type of work.”

Whom did he meet

According to Mehrotra, Kolatkar made friends among Chennai’s Tamil and Telugu poets and writers. But only four names are mentioned: Sri Sri, Arudra, Gora Sastri and Bairagi, all Telugu writers. Chennai was still the cultural capital for Telugu, although the controversial Andhra demand for the city had been settled a few years ago. The presence of so many Telugu literary personalities is therefore not surprising. Sri Sri and his nephew Arudra were well into their film careers, and had pronounced Left leanings. What conversations Kolatkar would have had with them is difficult to fathom. The Bohemian Bairagi may have provided better company.

Mehrotra doesn’t mention any Tamil writer although the city was teeming with them at the time. Jayakanthan, with his powerful short stories, was a rising star. The critic Ka.Naa. Subramanyam was mostly in Chennai at this time. Two years before Kolatkar’s arrival, Ashokamitran had moved to Chennai from Secunderabad and lived on Damodara Reddy Street, a stone’s throw from Madley Road: but he would have been busy at Gemini Studios and in any case he was only beginning his writing career then.

The broad-based leftist literary monthly, Saraswati, was at the height of its popularity, but Ci. Su. Chellappa’s little magazine Ezhuthu was still some years away. Evidently, Kolatkar did not establish contact with any of them. Whom did he meet, one wonders.

Kolatkar soon tired of Chennai. With prohibition in place he had to settle to drinking plain soda water. And eat pastries at McRennett. Bored, he once sat on a bench in Panagal Park overhearing the quotidian conversation of two lower middle-class families living in Triplicane: “I am feeling nihsaar [worthless]. I am feeling like acres and acres of insipidity. I am not feeling cheerful about anything in Madras. I go about with an offended expression on my face. I have constipation. I have got a snuff-tough cold. I am feeling sick...”

Soon after, in mid-1957, Kolatkar returned to Mumbai. As far as I can make out Chennai left no imprint on his writings: unless the idlis and images tumbling out of his famous poem ‘Breakfast Time at Kala Ghoda’ have something to do with his time in the city.

408,2020/10/10,‘Parveen Babi’ review: Prisoner of the white lights,"A film scribe chronicles the highs and lows of Parveen Babi’s life

Before the advent of Zeenat Aman and Parveen Babi, there were only two types of heroines— the vamp who smoked, drank and wore western clothes and the good girl who wore a sari and wept buckets. And so while Zeenat’s Jasbir tripped the light fantastic in Hare Rama Hare Krishna, (1971) Parveen Babi as Sunita lived in sin with Vijay in Deewar (1975) or captures Anthony Gonzalves’ heart as Jenny in Amar Akbar Anthony (1977).

Time freeze

In Parveen Babi, film journalist Karishma Upadhyay chronicles the highs and lows of Babi’s life. Her film career kicked off with B.R. Ishara’s Charitra (1973) and wound down in 1991 with Iraada, with a couple of absences along the way. While the book tells the story of a shy girl from the royal family in Junagadh in Gujarat through the prism of Babi’s mental illness, the book is addictive for capturing the zeitgeist of the 1970s and ’80s.

Starting dramatically with Parveen threatening to jump out of a car and strip on Andheri flyover, on the verge of a breakdown, the book moves back to Parveen’s childhood in Junagadh, losing her father at the age of six, her difficult relationship with her undemonstrative mother, Jamal, her move to Ahmedabad to study in St. Xavier’s College in 1968 and her move to Bombay to try her luck in films.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

In college, Parveen reinvented herself morphing from a painfully shy salwar-kameez clad girl to a gorgeous, confident-looking woman. Parveen’s excellent memory helped her get by college with minimal effort and also stood her in good stead during her acting career. She was not the best actress around, she was conscientious and would always remember her lines.

Upadhyay chronicles the three great loves in Parveen’s life — actors Danny Denzongpa and Kabir Bedi and director Mahesh Bhatt. Having spoken extensively with all the three men, Upadhyay is able to create an unforgettable picture of a woman who loved not too wisely but too well. While Parveen’s obsession with Amitabh Bachchan is mentioned, and the rumoured affair delved into, there is no quote from the Big B.

Myths busted

Along the way there are myths busted such as Parveen’s drug addiction (the actor never touched them). Apart from the three men, Upadhyay spoke to over a 100 people who knew and worked with Parveen from her college friends to her manager Ved Sharma who went far beyond the call of duty and costume designer Xerxes Bhathena. The book also quotes from film magazines with screaming headlines such as “Parveen Babi’s fight for sanity” or “Kabir Bedi exposes the lies Parveen told” and “Parveen Babi: Fed up of being the poor man’s Zeenat Aman.”

With all the conversations around mental illness, it is distressing that things have changed and still remained the same in 40 years. The book quotes from ‘The Confessions of Parveen Babi’, which the actor wrote for The Illustrated Weekly in 1984. Parveen’s description of her breakdown is poignant especially as she continued to work, while in an increasingly fragile state. The industry was not very kind to her when she went away. They, however, welcomed her back every time thanks to Sharma’s hard work and her work ethic.

The photos in the book from the cover photo of a still from Namak Halal (1982) of Parveen performing ‘Jawani Jaaneman’ in a daring gold leotard to the back cover picture of the controversial ‘Khwab bankar Koi Aayega’ from Razia Sultan (1983) are well chosen. There are also pictures of Parveen on set, on the cover of Time and candid shots where her natural grace shines through.

Full of interesting nuggets like the venerable Shabana Azmi’s pet name being Munni (!), Parveen living at Basavangudi in Bengaluru to recuperate and her love of reading, the book brings alive the fun and freedom apart from the heat and heartbreak of the days when the common man could only guess at what the stars were up to in their ivory towers.

409,2020/10/10,‘Why Men Rape’ review: The difficulty in understanding the word ‘no’,"Deciphering rape and its basis in how Indian men are brought up on false notions of masculinity and a deep sense of entitlement

For her book Why Men Rape, Tara Kaushal spent a week each with nine men who have allegedly raped but haven’t been convicted for various reasons. She visited them in their homes, spoke to them, their families and friends, and tried to understand their history and milieu in order to decipher the underlying motives of rape.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

Her enterprise and courage must be lauded. She created a different persona, took along a male colleague, gained the men’s confidence, and made them respond to the same set of 250 questions each. What she culled from the interviews does not add any startling new perspective to our understanding of rape, but it is still a commendable project.

The loyalty test

All sorts of men from all backgrounds rape, but what is common is the broad rubric of patriarchy. Boys are brought up with notions of masculinity that demand from them a violent and competitive sexual and social presence. They also grow up with a deep sense of entitlement. As Kaushal notes, Indian boys grow into manhood never having heard the word ‘no’. Equally important, it is ingrained in Indian men that their first loyalty is to the natal family. This explains the constant endorsement of the ma-behen concept — because outside of this framework, men are unable to respect women.

The men Kaushal spoke to have had no sex education. They are ignorant not just of the sexual act but also of women’s bodies and minds. In many cases, they don’t know what ‘rape’ is. Forcing oneself upon resisting women is not understood as rape but as normal sex because they grow up internalising that women will always resist due to modesty but this need not be taken seriously. Worse, aggressive possessiveness and violent acts of possessing are equated with deep love — a notion fondly peddled by film directors like Sandeep Vanga. The proprietorial control of women also then becomes the basis of honour rape and war rape — when a woman is violated to punish her ‘owner’, the man.

Social network

Kaushal reiterates two other important aspects. One is societal rage born of extreme social disempowerment — many of these men are poor, oppressed and brutalised themselves. Second is the unlimited pornography available on mobile phones. As one subject tells Kaushal in a fit of self-disgust, “Jio se free internet band karo.” (Stop free internet from Jio.) Violent pornography mixed with zero sexual awareness makes for a toxic cocktail.

Case studies are always interesting and one wanted to see each history systematically traced from beginning to end. Unfortunately, the book keeps jumping between case studies, research and comment, making one lose track and patience.

The book can’t decide if it wants to be social treatise, WhatsApp chat or Netflix movie script, jerking from academic prose to street slang to dialogue and homily. An informal style is fine but to litter the text with chat acronyms and accompany each WTF with a footnote is a bit precious. It is baffling that the acronym SO should be used at all with ‘significant other’ as a painstaking footnote. Also, the frequent digressions to state opinions or make interjections — “Whoa, dude, chill out; why so serious…” — get banal.

Or, perhaps, all these points that I see as drawbacks make the book a perfect millennial read.

410,2020/10/10,‘Superpower Showdown: How the Battle Between Trump and Xi Threatens a New Cold War’ review: The end of the affair,"Two journalists document in painstaking detail the souring of the US-China relationship in the era of Donald Trump and Xi Jinping and its consequences

Superpower Showdown, a gripping and granular account of the past, present and future of the United States-China trade war by two former Beijing correspondents of The Wall Street Journal, could just as well have been titled Marriage Story.

“Think of this as a romance gone bad,” write Bob Davis and Lingling Wei, as they document in painstaking detail the souring of the U.S.-China relationship in the era of Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.

They tell the story of how a relationship that once seemed to be “wrapped in a permanent embrace” of economic interdependence — so much so that it came to be dubbed “Chimerica” by some and described by officials in Beijing as “an old married couple who needed each other, even if they might bicker” — has descended into outright confrontation, with huge implications not just for both countries, but for the world.

Rich perspectives

There are perhaps no two journalists better placed to tell this tale. Mr. Davis spent three years covering China’s economy at the WSJ’s Beijing bureau, and subsequently moved to cover trade-related issues in Washington. Ms. Wei has been among the most well-informed reporters covering Chinese politics in Beijing for years, with the kind of access that eludes most foreign correspondents.

(Stay up to date on new book releases, reviews, and more with The Hindu On Books newsletter. Subscribe here.)

How did it come to this? This is the question that drives the two writers. The strength of this book lies in the rich perspectives it offers from both Washington and Beijing, presenting a clear insight into the decision-making of both parties, and how, during the course of a turbulent two-year trade war, they came to so often completely misread the intentions of the other. The blame, the writers suggest, lies with both.

The book is rich with reporting full of insider details. Two episodes, in particular, stand out. In the autumn of 2012, shortly before his ascension to take over as the next leader of China’s Communist Party, then Vice President Xi Jinping famously went missing for two weeks. He cancelled meetings with visiting officials, including the Prime Minister of Singapore and the U.S. Secretary of State, at the last minute. The disappearance triggered feverish speculation among China-watchers, who were gripped that year by the political intrigue surrounding the purge of Bo Xilai, Xi’s rival.

The enduring mystery of Xi’s disappearance has a somewhat mundane explanation, the writers suggest. Xi retreated from Beijing with a group of close advisers to Zhuji, a small town on the Yangtze river in Zhejiang province, where he served as a provincial leader. Those two weeks would, however, end up being very significant in determining the future course of Chinese politics. Xi and his advisers came up with his “China Dream” campaign in Zhejiang, and deciding to make the “rejuvenation” of China their central agenda — heralding a turn towards nationalism.

Lessons for India

The book also sheds new light on the now famous April 2019 meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, where China’s leaders did a u-turn on agreeing to a trade deal. The book says three of Xi’s fellow members took him by surprise by how vociferously they objected to the deal, which had been shepherded by Liu He, a close adviser of Xi’s. Third-ranked Li Zhanshu, head of China’s legislature, told Xi on key U.S. proposals to amend Chinese laws to protect foreign firms that “no country has the right to tell China what laws it must amend.” Top party ideologue Wang Huning and vice premier Han Zheng were other strong voices in favour of tearing up the deal.

The book leaves us with four important lessons that may be of particular relevance for India as it looks to navigate what will continue to be a stormy U.S.-China relationship.

Firstly, the lesson from the April 2019 Politburo meeting, in the authors’ view, is that as different as the two political systems are, “Chinese leaders still face constraints”. It tells us how Chinese decision-making works. Xi “couldn’t afford to be seen weak in dealing with the Americans.” He would end up relenting and taking a harder line on the deal to fend off criticism.

Secondly, should Trump remain in office post-November, the book offers many lessons in how U.S. decision-making works too in the Trump era. It gives Trump credit for taking on China and addressing structural concerns that previous administrations had ignored, but is unsparing in assessing his deficiencies. He “started the biggest trade war since the 1930s,” they wrote, “with only a superficial understanding of how China worked and without a specific goal in mind or plan to achieve success”. The trade deficit, they note, would only continue to grow on his watch.

His biggest failure would be his disdain for working with U.S. allies, one reason, they suggest, for his inability to achieve what he wanted on the China front. It doesn’t paint Trump’s team of advisers in a very favourable light, instead showing us a rather chaotic White House that operated without any strategic vision, instead lurching from decision to decision to appease the whims of its very distracted current occupant.

Thirdly, the book notes how the U.S. trade and technology war, that has certainly crippled the ambitions of Chinese tech giants from Huawei to ZTE, is spurring an even more ambitious Chinese move towards technological self-reliance. The “Anke project” (or to make China “secure and controllable”) is looking to purge Chinese government agencies, telecom firms and power-grids of all foreign software and hardware. Under its “352” rule, they will allocate 30% of all contracts to domestic providers in 2020, an additional 50% in 2020, and the remaining 20% in 2021. The great tech divide is here to stay.

And so is the U.S.-China divide. The book, finally, makes a strong case for why Trump may be a part of the reason for the end of the affair, but he “is not the entire answer.” The shift in U.S. attitudes towards China is much bigger than Trump. It is not only bipartisan, but most importantly, has now extended to many U.S. companies as well, who for long were happy to be Beijing’s most vocal lobbyists in Washington.

The trade and economic battle didn’t start with Trump, and the book tells us it certainly won’t end with him.

Kumar Bendre’s Kannada novel, Daali, was released online by film director Nagathihalli Chandrashekar. “Vitual book releases are in,” says Kumar. “They seem to apt these days. The online platform seems to be the perfect place to bring writers, publishers and readers, together. Earlier we needed a stage and an audience to release books, not anymore. This, in a way, is good as people can be a part of such literary events from within the confines of their homes.”

Nagathihalli said, “I am thrilled to be part of this exercise. This is the first time I am part of a virtual book release. The event has brought the writer, publisher and readers together virtually.” The director stressed the importance of reading. “People from all walks of life should encourage reading and writing as reading seems to be overshadowed by technology.”

Kumar, who hails from Hubli, is a journalist. He writes short stories and poetry. He started his career as a journalist working with Gauri Lankesh in Samyukta Karnataka and now is with Udaya Vani in Hubli. “I started writing books mainly because as a journalist, you tend to be stuck with a word limit.”

Talking about Daali, which means attack, Kumar says the book is not a murder mystery. “It is based on the deaths of MM Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh. The novel is about a war of ideologies between two groups. A war that can lead to violence and later to death.”

Kumar started writing the book 10 months ago. Thrilled that his friend, Nagathihalli released the book, Kumar said, “We have been friends for almost 15 years now. I learnt a lot about literature and cinema from him,”

412,2020/10/10,How literature and love helped me deal with loss,"This sports journalist talks of the impact of loss, his experience with depression, and how he coped with it

Trigger warning: The following article mentions suicide, and may be disturbing for some

“Tu paagal toh nahi hai (Are you mad)?” The ragpicker said, not angrily, but then proceeded to thrash me.

Solitude, a soulmate

Sadness has been an integral part of my life: the sadness of losing loved ones, friends, family members. I would read of a stranger’s death and skip a meal, brood. I loved it, this being alone, being sad. I was surrounded by family and friends, all of whom loved me, yet I revelled in solitude. I don’t know when I began to love melancholy in cinema, and dreamt of being Rajesh Khanna from Anand or Guru Dutt in Kaagaz ke Phool.

Why would anyone feel alone amidst so many people? It is hard to explain, but easy to understand if you are in depression — a condition I was diagnosed with only later in life, but probably had even as a boy — where you want to shut yourself off from the world and just disappear.

The first time it came to the fore was when I was 12 years old. I was emotionally attached to my sister-in-law. She was a friend, sister, mother, and I drew inspiration from her. One day, she scolded me for something silly and my world seemed to have crashed. I slipped out of her home in Delhi and wandered around, looking for ways to end my sadness. Over the next few days, I contemplated suicide many times over, showing up at a spot in the city often.

This one time, a ragpicker had been observing me, and that day, two strong hands pulled me back from the brink. He dragged me to the police station nearby, and I pleaded with them to let me go. They took pity on me, and did. I returned to my sister-in-law’s arms and just broke down.

That was my first brush with death. I grew up with the guilt of having caused suffering to my vahini (Marathi for sister-in-law). I also grew up avoiding people, not turning up for social events, because I wanted to stay in my room. I never understood why; my family thought it was the anger that goes with teenage years. It wasn’t.

Working at it

As a sports journalist travelling around the world, I have walked around both strange and familiar cities alone, not wanting to communicate with people. Many have misunderstood this to mean that I call only when I want something.

Playing football and cricket, and my sports writing kept me afloat, but I did not have the courage to confide in anyone that there was something wrong inside. What would they think of me?

I had the best parents. They pampered me, and then I lost them in quick succession when I was 30. Much before they took leave of this world, they had come to understand what some of my friends thought were my “weird” ways. Being alone was weird.

Then 15 years ago, my family doctor confirmed I was suffering from acute depression, when I repeated the suicidal episode. This time, I had my wonderful wife and son — Sunanda and Akshay — and office colleague C Rajshekhar Rao to look after me. They hijacked me from my work, and sent me off to the mountains — 15 days of bliss. I came to terms with myself and settled into a routine, looking to make new friends, basically to convince everyone that I was normal.

Only a few knew. Kadambari Murali Wade, a fellow journalist at the time, was one, and would speak to me for hours on end over the phone.

Books, my saviour

I looked for refuge in books and for peace by forging new friendships. In fact, I excelled at striking up conversations with strangers of all ages, mainly because they wouldn’t ask me, “Tu paagal toh nahi hai?” I wasn’t sure if it was written on my face, this sadness. I dreaded the mirror because it reflected a sorrowful image. I decided to fight it by immersing myself in work.

My coping mechanisms also lay in writings on spirituality. The Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda became a companion and I loved it when Virat Kohli tweeted a selfie with that book a few years ago. Not that he had my mental health condition. Swami Vivekananda also became my new friend.

Of course, I was ravaged time and again by painful memories of losing the people I loved, one by one — in just four years, I had lost three close friends. The realisation that I wouldn’t see them again would leave me acutely depressed. It would become worse when seeking help from friends — as grateful I am for them, at the time, I felt they all had their own worlds and could not always spare time for me.

During the lockdown

My low moods were becoming more frequent and damaging, and worsened after the lockdown. My diabetes and hypertension forced me to stay home for months.

I began to read literature online about battling depression. I was never convinced that counselling would heal my mental state. I believed in facing it on my own. But a few online counselling workshops during this period gave me the strength to come to terms with life and my condition again.

Then I got this priceless recommendation from a friend. I ordered Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression — and the Unexpected Solutions by Johann Hari and slowly accepted that depression was a condition that could be dealt with, and that the stigma attached to it should be broken — hence I am writing this.

I realised that your best friends are at home: my family, and my childhood friend Ghaus Mohammad. They have all the time for you. I have learnt to smile again, thanks to them. I have acquired the courage to accept my condition and look for ways to conquer it, rather than deny it or pretend it isn’t there: a daily walk, reading a variety of literature, and writing that often gives me an escape. I have learnt to enjoy my life in the moment.

To the question, ‘Tu paagal toh nahi hai?’ I would say, I am seeking help, not attention.

415,2020/10/10,Eifel GP | Valtteri Bottas drives to pole,"Mercedes teammate Hamilton to share front row

Valtteri Bottas seized pole position for the Eifel Grand Prix on Saturday with Mercedes teammate and Formula One championship leader Lewis Hamilton alongside on the front row of the grid at the Nurburgring.

Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, who had been on provisional pole after the first flying laps of the final session at the German circuit, qualified in third place with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc fourth.

Bottas’ pole was his third of 2020 for Mercedes but this one looked in the balance right to the end.

Great last lap

“It’s such a nice feeling when you get it on the last lap, with the last chance,” said the Finn after celebrating his 14th career pole. “The last lap in Q3 (the final phase) was spot on.”

Bottas is 44 points behind six-time World champion Hamilton, who will still fancy his chances of a record-equalling 91st career win on Sunday at a track that last hosted an F1 race in 2013.

“Valtteri did a great job so congrats to him,” said the Briton. “There’s a lot to play for tomorrow so I need to get my head down.”

Germany’s Nico Hulkenberg will make an unexpected appearance on Sunday from last place on the grid after replacing an unwell Lance Stroll at Racing Point.

Starting grid:

Row 1: 1. Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes), Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes); Row 2: Max Verstappen (Red Bull), Charles Leclerc (Ferrari); Row 3: Alexander Albon (Red Bull), Daniel Ricciardo (Renault); Row 4: Esteban Ocon (Renault), Lando Norris (McLaren); Row 5: Sergio Perez (Racing Point), Carlos Sainz Jr. (McLaren); Row 6: Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari), Pierre Gasly (AlphaTauri); Row 7: Daniil Kvyat (AlphaTauri), Antonio Giovinazzi (Alfa Romeo).

416,2020/10/10,"Coronavirus | Antibody cocktail given to Donald Trump may protect against COVID-19, says study","Further research in multiple animal models is needed.

The experimental antibody cocktail which U.S. President Donald Trump received when he tested positive for COVID-19 offers benefits against the novel coronavirus infection, according to a new study in animal models which provides more evidence of the clinical potential of the therapeutic.

While earlier studies had shown that the cocktail of two antibodies targeting the coronavirus spike protein could be used to neutralise the pathogen, scientists from the American biotechnology company Regeneron noted that further research in multiple animal models is needed to test the effectiveness of the formulation.

Mild and severe cases

In the current study, published in the journal Science, the researchers tested REGN-COV2 in rhesus macaques, which manifest mild COVID-19 symptoms, and in golden hamsters, which show symptoms that are much more severe, including rapid weight loss.

They found that when the cocktail was administered three days before challenging the macaques with the virus, the treatment almost completely blocked establishment of infection.

According to the scientists, this ability of REGN-COV2 “matches or exceeds the effects recently shown in vaccine efficacy studies using the same animal models.”

“These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of (this approach) to both protect from and treat SARS-CoV-2 disease,” the researchers noted in the study.

Macaques and hamsters

When the macaques were treated with the drug one day after infection, they said there was faster viral clearance than in controls who had not been treated with the cocktail.

In the hamster model, the study noted that the animals treated with the drug two days before infection exhibited a “dramatic protection from weight loss,” and decreased viral load in the lungs.

The scientists also reported benefits for hamsters treated one day after infection, as compared to controls. “In conclusion, our data provide evidence that REGN-COV2 based therapy may offer clinical benefit in both prevention and treatment settings of COVID-19 disease, where it is currently being evaluated,” they wrote in the study.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/4ffj73/article32822613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TH-SCICOVIDjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/coronavirus-antibody-cocktail-given-to-donald-trump-may-protect-against-covid-19-says-study/article32822614.ece

418,2020/10/10,Biological plant-virus ‘arms race’ uncovered,"How tiny geminiviruses that measure a mere 20 nanometres can enter large plants and break through their defences

Plants and viruses are constantly involved in a race to outdo one another, and their lives literally depend on this. A new study with researchers from National Centre of Biological Sciences (NCBS-TIFR), Bengaluru, has discovered a new step in this arms race between the virus called Synedrella Yellow Vein Clearing Virus and the plants it attacks. The virus was isolated by the researchers from a plant named Synedrella nodiflora, and it was able to infect tobacco and tomato plant in their studies.

Large family

This virus is a representative of the Begomovirus family of viruses. “Begomoviruses are a large family with about 400 members. They infect economically important plants and are a major reason for crop loss,” explains Ashwin Nair, from NCBS-TIFR, who is the first author of a paper on the work published in BMC Biology. “We think SyYVCV can infect many more host plants.”

Attacks, counter-attacks

The arms race typically happens like this: The virus first attacks the plant, and the plant has defences that are actually counter-attacks – mechanisms that seek to destroy the virus. In turn, the virus develops a counter-counter-attack by trying to escape being destroyed by the plant’s mechanisms. In the case of the Synedrella Yellow Vein Clearing Virus, it happens this way: When the virus attacks the plant, it produces vein-clearing symptoms which make the plant look beautiful.

The fact, however, is that this does not make it better for the plant. It actually makes it difficult for the plant to produce flowers and fruits. “Without BetaC1, a viral protein, the virus will not be able to defeat the host attacks and also will not be able to completely infect the plant, as the virus will not be able to move through the veins of the plant,” says P.V. Shivaprasad, in whose lab at NCBS-TIFR the work was carried out.

In turn, the plant develops defence mechanisms to destroy the virus. It targets the protein called BetaC1 made by the virus which helps in successful infection and intracellular movement within the plant. Plants degrade BetaC1 protein of virus by tagging this protein with another smaller protein called ubiquitin.

Viral response

In their study, the researchers found that, in response, the virus uses the plant’s machinery to create a small modification of the BetaC1 protein. It adds a tiny protein called SUMO to the betaC1 protein in a process termed SUMOylation. “BetaC1 hijacks the SUMO pathway machinery of the plants and makes itself a substrate for SUMOylation. Essentially, BetaC1 mimics or tricks the host SUMOylation machinery as if it is one of the host plant protein requiring SUMOylation,” explains Prof. Shivaprasad.

Kiran Chatterjee and Ranabir Das, also at NCBS-TIFR, collaborated in understanding the nano-scale SUMOylation process, because such small interactions can only be studied by special protein-protein structure determining techniques

Tiny virus

The study used tobacco plants. The virus is fairly new. Says Dr Shivaprasad, “We isolated it in 2018 and have not studied its prevalence in other crops. Viruses very similar to this virus are the biggest threat to crop production throughout world.” Apparently, in infected fields, up to 60% of horticultural crops are lost due to begomoviral infection.

Viruses can range in size from 5 nanometre to 300 nanometre. The studied virus, which falls under the category geminivirus, is among the smaller ones, measuring about 20 nanometres. The SARS-CoV-2 virus, for instance is about five times larger than these. Within this small size, they make proteins that are comparable in size with those of the plants that help them function.

The difference comes in the number of proteins they make. While the rice plant makes about 35,000 proteins, and we humans make about 20,000 proteins, geminiviruses code for just 8-10 proteins. The larger SARS-CoV-2 virus codes for about 25 proteins.

New results

“These concepts are new to plant–pathogen interactions. Previously, researchers did find the significance of other protein modifications, but not the ones we have found in this study,” says Dr Shivaprasad. “Our results also provide newer tools to identify and generate plants that can resist viruses.”",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/gqratu/article32822579.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TH-SCIPLANTJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/biological-plant-virus-arms-race-uncovered/article32822580.ece
419,2020/10/10,Spiders spin a tale of migration,"Constructed histories of sister spider families show how they may have dispersed from India to Southeast Asia 55-38 million years ago

About 55 million years ago, when the Indian Subcontinent collided with Asia, many plants and animals migrated from India to other parts of Asia. Now, by studying the evolutionary history of a spider family, researchers have tried to map the dispersal event from India to the islands of Southeast Asia 55–38 million years ago.

The team from the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted extensive field surveys in Tibet, Nepal and Sri Lanka, and genetic studies were carried out on over 100 global spider species. Based on the climate and the current distribution of these spiders, they concentrated on 12 regions including South and Central America, Africa, Madagascar, India, Sumatra, Fiji and Borneo.

Common ancestor

The constructed histories show that a spider subfamily called Theotiminae might have come from Africa, whereas a sister family called Ochyroceratinae had a South American origin. This means they had more than one common evolutionary ancestor and the taxonomy might even need revisions.

Why not to East Asia?

One question the researchers were trying to answer was: Why did the spiders not migrate from India to East Asia? They note that, in contrast to the tropical and wet regions of Southeast Asia, East Asian countries like China, Japan, Korea and Mongolia, had an arid climate with less than 800 mm of annual precipitation during that period.

“Despite no obvious geographical barrier, this dry or seasonal climate acted as barriers to the colonisation of East Asia by theotimines,” explains the paper published in Systematic Biology.

Role of climate

Also, during that period, the Tibetan Plateau developed into a mountain belt with almost 4000 m height and the colder and drier climate was also unsuitable for the spiders.

“Our analyses suggest that climate plays a more important role than geology in biological migration from the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia, providing new insights into the Indian–Asian biogeographic link,” notes the paper.

During the field study the team noted that in some areas, the spiders were found in leaf litter in the forests, while in others they were occupying caves.

Habitat shifts

The researchers write that these habitat shifts also occur depending on the climate of the area. “Most caves have an almost constant temperature and high humidity throughout the year, providing suitable shelters for theotimines in seasonally variable environments. Species in a wet environment can live in the litter or caves, whereas species in an environment with low precipitation are more often found in caves,” adds the paper.

The team writes that an “integrative approach combining different sources of evidence, such as biogeography and ecology,” can provide a more realistic reconstruction of evolutionary history. They predict that other organisms distributed in the tropical zones may also exhibit similar mechanisms of migration.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/lj4yax/article32822541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TH-SCISPIDERjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/spiders-spin-a-tale-of-migration/article32822542.ece
420,2020/10/10,Coronavirus | U.S. universities rely on rapid tests for safe campus return,"To make up for low sensitivity of rapid tests, all were tested twice a week

As educational institutions in India are set to open to students under Unlock-5, colleges and universities can make students return safely by following the example of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the U.S. and other American universities.

To ensure safe return to campus, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign began an ambitious initiative in mid-August to test for free all students, faculty and staff for novel coronavirus using a rapid saliva-based test that was developed in-house. Testing of faculty and staff began in July.

Frequent testing

Despite the low sensitivity compared with RT-PCR, rapid antigen tests were preferred as they were quick, cost less and therefore allowed frequent testing on a large scale. To compensate for the low sensitivity of rapid tests, all the students, faculty and staff were compulsorily required to get tested twice a week.

Rochelle P. Walensky and her collaborators from Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, modelled different scenarios to safely re-open campuses. They report in JAMA Network Open that “symptom-based screening alone is not sufficient to contain an outbreak. Safe reopening of campuses in fall 2020 may require screening every two days, besides following good prevention practices”. The symptom-based approach will also miss detecting asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases, which form a majority according to a paper in the journal PNAS.

When a student tests positive, he/she is informed of the result and asked to isolate, and all contacts who had spent more than 15 minutes within six feet distance from the index case are traced and asked to quarantine.

While just 311 fresh cases were detected from August 17-23, a spike in fresh cases was seen in end-August and early-September when 549 new cases were detected in just three days. The university was forced to undertake partial lockdown on student activities. The spike in fresh cases attracted huge media criticism, and Nigel Goldenfeld and Sergei Maslov who were involved in the programme were pilloried for the outbreak.

Besides the students testing positive at the time of entry, it was found that students who tested positive violated isolation and partied leading to large virus spread. The testing programme was based on modelling studies that took into account how students socialise, including attending parties without wearing a mask. “We modelled that they were going to go to parties and that they probably weren’t going to wear masks, and it would lead to some level of transmission. What we didn’t model for is that people would choose to go to a party if they knew that they were positive,” Martin Burke from the University’s Department of Chemistry who helped develop the saliva test told Nature. “The overwhelming majority of our students have done a great job, but unfortunately, a small number of students chose to make very bad decisions that led to a rise in cases.”

Improvements to note

Following some restrictions on student gatherings for two weeks, fresh cases reported have since dropped — from 230 cases on August 31 (test positivity rate of 1.34%) to 25 cases on October 6 (test positivity rate of 0.24%). When restrictions were loosened students once again returned to more social engagement leading to 62 fresh cases on September 22, the highest since September 8. However, fresh cases have reduced since then.

“It’s good to praise improvements. Once campus reopened, we had no choice but to do everything we could to reduce spread. The restrictions helped. But we need to avoid equating relative improvement with absolute success. The plan was not and still is not a success,” Daniel Simons, a cognitive psychology Professor at the university tweeted. “We shouldn’t treat an improvement relative to an awful situation as success, just as it’s wrong to say things are great here because they’re better here than at other universities that have done less testing.”

Model system

Up to 10,000 students are tested each day and totally over 4,92,000 tests have been done till October 6 with a seven-day test positivity rate of 0.28%. “Surveillance and rapid response are part of any reasonable plan. That they did this and it worked was a huge success,” Carl T. Bergstrom from the University of Washington tweeted.

Today, the University’s mass testing programme is being touted as a model system and many universities — Yale University, Indiana University, Harvard University, University of Georgia, University of Wisconsin — have emulated it.

Dr. Giridhara Babu, epidemiologist from the Public Health Foundation of India, Bengaluru, is not upbeat in replicating this strategy to detect cases and break the transmission chain when students return to colleges/universities. In an email to The Hindu, he says: “It is important not to blindly increase the testing numbers without the end goal. In public health, it is also important to ensure that necessary interventions such as isolation centres which provide the standard of care are arranged before scaling up universal testing when a screening mechanism is implemented in universities/colleges.” He is also concerned about the cost of using rapid tests repeatedly to detect cases. “With the current costs, I am also not sure if this strategy can be employed at scale in India,” he says.

The other side

Despite the advantages of detecting asymptomatic cases early and thereby breaking the transmission chain, he is in favour of testing those who show symptoms. “From decreasing mortality, the mainstay of testing will still be to find those who have symptoms and test them rather than randomly testing everyone and every time. Testing is only a tool to know if transmission is present, that too an imperfect one. It is not mere numbers, improving the overall testing strategy of finding those who have symptoms, through syndromic approach might be more beneficial in India,” Dr. Babu says.",,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/k73fta/article32822511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TH-SCIRAPID-TESTjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/coronavirus-us-universities-rely-on-rapid-tests-for-safe-campus-return/article32822513.ece
