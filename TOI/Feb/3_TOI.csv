Dealing with trolls

Embracing sadness

On ‘me’ time

‘Digital detox is necessary’



Her bestie, Suhana Khan

Being in Bengaluru

might have just made her debut in Bollywood , but the young actress has already been a troll-favourite – either for her comments on her father, actor Chunky’s, struggle in the industry, or her take on nepotism. During a recent youth summit in Bengaluru, however, theactress won the hearts of the audience as she took on a volley of questions on stage quite spiritedly. Excerpts…People say harsh things online - there was even an instance where people had said that I feigned my college admission, and actually did not have to choose between my college and my career. I know I didn't lie, and I did not know why people wrote what they did. So, things like that do hurt. But I have learnt to let go of things I cannot control and believe that change starts from within. Kindness is underrated, so I always focus on how I can remain kind. Actor Tiger Shroff, my co-star from Student of the year 2, would say, ""the bigger the target, the easier it is, to shoot."" So, in that sense, all my haters are my fans too, in some way, because they are giving me that much importance, taking time out to post about something and write out a negative comment. And kindness is the way to resolve issues because I think that those that spread hate are the ones that need love the most.I'd be lying if I said that the negative things people have to say hasn't not taken a toll on me and everything is hunky-dory. I am happy and positive for the most part. But it is normal when the one-odd comment does hurt you and you get upset about it.My work keeps me motivated. I love acting and being a part of the industry. And I am surrounded by such lovely people who are looking out for me and truly care for me - my family, my team. The love that's around me, keeps me going and it completely outweighs the hate. That's what others who feel bogged down should do too - spend time with the people that you love and things instantly get better. It's the best medicine.I too feel bogged down at times, but I try to focus on the good things in life. I believe it is important to go through sadness and get through negativity. I try to focus on one positive moment every day, and I'd encourage everyone else to do the same too. In case you don't have a happy moment, I suggest you create a happy moment for someone else, and that becomes your happy moment too!I take time out for myself and beat the stress by chilling with my family. I used to be an annoying teenager who wouldn't engage in conversations with family, and go off into my room to be by myself. But I grew out of it and I'm glad I did. I realised that the way we believe our parents are not understanding us, they might be thinking the same about us too.The theme of this year’s summit, celebrating confusion, is so appropriate to me. It’s natural to be confused about making decisions and one should embrace it. Only when you think of all the different options available, and the repercussions of choosing each of them, that confusion begins. And I think it’s necessary too.Also, I love interacting with people and if there is any chance to talk, I'm game, because I love talking. And the fact that I get to do it, especially with youngsters, and being around people who are so passionate about what they do is amazing. The opportunity to meet interesting people always excites me - it's what I love about my job too.I feel like every time I open my phone, when I see troubling news updates – it’s a very sad and scary to read about them, and it might get overwhelming to a point where I wish to detach from my phone. But, having said that, I also believe that one needs to be cued in and aware of what's going in the world, so I do not detach completely. I find my peace in going back to family, the people I love, and in counting my blessings.When asked, which of her best friends doesn’t respond to her calls or chats immediately, Ananya says, “I always try to reach out to Suhana, on various social networking platforms, but she almost never responds immediately.” (Laughs)I love Bengaluru. It is a lovely, creative, clean city to be in.

2,['3/02/2020'],I did Gentleman because it has a story that needs to be told: Nishvika Naidu,"In the two years that she’s been a part of the Kannada film industry, Nishvika Naidu has ensured that she is a force to reckon with, which should explain why filmmakers choose to collaborate with her on multiple projects. Her release this week, Gentleman, is a case in point, given that she was made the offer after working with filmmaker Guru Deshpande , who has backed this one, on his directorial, Paddehuli . Interestingly, Guru has given Nishvika a rather serious role this time around. Apart from the fact that she plays lead hero Prajwal Devaraj ’s love interest, Nishvika also gets to get into the skin of a nutritionist, Tapaswini, who is extremely health conscious. “Since my debut, the roles I have done have always been of bubbly, hyperactive girl, which is pretty much in sync with how I am in real life. In Gentleman, though, Tapaswini is more serious and mature; she is the responsible member of the household, who, on account of what she does in her career, is also very conscious about the food choices her family makes. Given that this is in stark contrast to my personality, it was difficult to play this character at first. Director Jadesh Kumar would ask me to ‘tone down’ during sequences. I had to be constantly reminded that I was Tapaswini,”she laughs.”Although Nishvika is the romantic interest in the film, it also has a serious undertone, given that it deals with the protagonist’s medical condition and a hitherto unexplored human egg trafficking angle. So, what was it about Gentleman that appealed to her? “As actors, it is important to choose movies that are more than just glitz and glam and have a worthy social message. I took up this movie, not so much for my career prospect, but because it had a story that needed to be told,”explains Nishvika.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73871002,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-238298/73871002.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/i-did-gentleman-because-it-has-a-story-that-needs-to-be-told-nishvika-naidu/articleshow/73868225.cms

6,['3/02/2020'],"If I’m accepted as Jayalalithaa, I want to do a film on Kannagi next: Kangana Ranaut","For many actors, okaying a shot in a single take is a matter of pride. But for Kangana Ranaut , it’s the satisfaction of getting the scene right that counts. Even if it’s just an expression that comes for a fraction of a second in a whole song sequence! The actress is shooting in Chennai for Vijay ’s Thalaivi , a biopic on former actress and CM of Tamil Nadu, J Jayalalithaa , and we saw her requesting the team for retakes until both she and the director were happy with the outcome. Taking a chair by the side of a beautifully done up stage, she continues to practise her hand movements and expressions for a few minutes before speaking to us about why she was kicked about doing another biopic, the challenges of playing a real-life person, how she reacts to criticism and more. Excerpts:Actually, I’m still processing it. I’m absolutely grateful to people, and those who thought I deserved it. I’m also thankful to every one of them who have loved me. I believe I have been very unconventional in my journey, from when I started to now receiving the Padma. It has been full of very extreme highs and very extreme lows, and I’m glad that people have seen me through all of that. So yes, this has not been something that I expected to start my year with, for sure.Even in Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai, my role was loosely based on Madhubala. But after Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, this is my next proper biopic. It’s not that I choose these roles. I can say I’m only fortunate because I’ve been able to have this opportunity.I’ve also put on a few kilos (smiles). I’d done Dhaam Dhoom long ago, and I never had the opportunity to tap into this region, especially Tamil Nadu, after that. My films do well in the north, but I wanted to connect with the audience in the south. I think this is a great opportunity for that. I really want to do more work here.Apart from my personal liking for her, it’s the very extraordinary life that she lived, and the extraordinary perseverance and strength that she showed in the face of adversity… these are truly remarkable. But of course, you need to see if it makes sense cinematically as well. When I choose to do a film, I see what’s there in it for the audience more than what’s there in it for me. I feel that her journey makes for an exceptionally good screenplay, in terms of cinema and politics blending into each other.Yes, for instance, the culture is very, very different here. Amma has been a sensational, most loved superstar. When I did my research on her, I found out what an icon she was... the way she carried herself, she’s also a style icon. She never did timid characters on screen, she was a trailblazer. To become Amma is an interesting arc, but a difficult arc to achieve.We have just started the film. When it comes out, that’s when people get to actually see the complete product and react.Oh yes, and it is amazing to be working with him. Their relationship (between Jayalalithaa and MGR , played by Arvind Swami) is layered. It’s an intense relationship between friends, mentor (and his protégée) and much more. And when they are both in politics, it also becomes competitive. This kind of dynamic relationship that they share has many shades… amicable, admiration, mentoring, and then, goes on to become a competition of sorts. It’s extraordinary. And Arvind Swami is such a subtle artiste who can pull off any scene with ease. What he brings to the film is very amazing and we are fortunate to get the casting right.The kind of films I’ve started to do in Bollywood, I need that kind of script here as well. I’m not ready to play second fiddle to the hero. I hear it happens in the south, like it happens in Mumbai as well. But the other day, I was telling Vijay sir that he has to make a film on this iconic lady who’s worshipped here — Kannagi. If I’m accepted as Jayalalithaa, I want him to make Kannagi for me. She’s such an iconic character, such a strong woman, and it will make for an epic drama. But I want to do that film only in Tamil. Hopefully, it should manifest.Vijayendra Prasad sir (writer of the film) was researching on Jayalalithaa, and I heard it from him (smiles).",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73871828,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-857833/73871828.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/if-im-accepted-as-jayalalithaa-i-want-to-do-a-film-on-kannagi-next-kangana-ranaut/articleshow/73871828.cms

12,['3/02/2020'],FC Goa players maintain calm as new coaching team takes over,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Panaji: For anyone who had walked inside the GMC Athletic Stadium at Bambolim and heard FC Goa players laugh their heart out, he might have been left to wonder what the fuss is all about.

FC Goa have sacked their most successful coach Sergio Lobera , assistant coach Jesus Tato and conditioning coach Manuel Sayabera, but there was no funeral silence when interim coach Derrick Pereira and new conditioning coach Roman Cunnilera conducted their first training session on Sunday.

After two days of uncertainty when training was hastily cancelled as the club sat down with Lobera to terminate contracts, the players assembled again, this time to be greeted by Pereira, the club’s technical director and formerly assistant to Lobera during his first season here.

There was also the new conditioning coach. First to land at the stadium, Roman – who worked as assistant to Chelsea FC legend Claude Makele at Belgian top-tier club Eupen – made his presence felt and is understood to have told the club that a few changes are necessary to get the best out of the players.

On Sunday, neither Derrick nor Roman tried anything different to what was being done by the Spanish coaching team. If at all, everyone was told that they cannot afford to have any distractions at this stage, particularly when they are possibly three wins away from finishing on top and making it to the AFC Champions League.

If the players were unhappy, they did best not to show. The mood seemed just fine.

Derrick had a quiet word with Spanish defender Carlos Pena, the undisputed leader of the dressing room, before start of training, and then got the team together.

For the entire FC Goa contingent watching from the stands, this was a good sight. Players gave their all; Ahmed Jahouh connected an astonishingly good volley, goalkeeper Mohammed Nawaz showed ice-cool nerves while controlling the ball and Manvir Singh was among the goals – scored with his foot – during a small-sided game.

The bigger test, though, will be on Wednesday. And only then will everyone know if all is well with FC Goa.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police have registered a case after two unidentified persons allegedly opened fire outside Jamia Millia Islamia on Sunday night, police said.No one was injured in the attack.In a statement issued by the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), a group comprising students and alumni of the university formed to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act, said the attackers were on a red motorcycle.One of the miscreants was wearing a red jacket, the statement said.A senior police official said a case of attempt to murder under relevant sections of the IPC and the Arms Act was registered in connection with the incident and an investigation is underway.This is the third firing incident in the Jamia Nagar area in a week.On Thursday, a minor fired at anti-CAA protesters preparing to march from Jamia towards the Rajghat, injuring a student.Two days later, a 25-year-old fired two rounds in air at Shaheen Bagh, where a protest against the new citizenship law has been going on.

16,['3/02/2020'],Adnan Sami: You may have your own principles or your own beliefs but that doesn’t mean that you cannot respect somebody else’s beliefs,"Adnan Sami's Padma Shri ran into controversy on two grounds. One, does his body of work merit it? That, however, is a question that comes up each year for one or more recipients, irrespective of the regime in power. The second question, however, is not so common – should a man whose father fought against India in a war be feted by the Indian state? When Adnan spoke to us last year, he recurrently emphasised the point that he was ""loyal to India because of what my father taught me"". We ask him to comment on the recent outrage.""See, if you have been indoctrinated with a particular belief or principle... it's like this... once you have learnt engineering after that you apply that skill to a Maruti or a Mercedes, the principle is the same, right, because the education that you got was basically for an engine. So the indoctrination that I got from my father of the concept of loyalty, patriotism etc... he used it in his capacity, in his life for the country that he belonged to and he instilled those principles in me. Today, I am an Indian and the DNA of my upbringing and the principles that have been indoctrinated in me – I am using exactly the same principles but adopting it to my country. And so my sense of loyalty is absolutely intact, but for the country that I belong to,"" he explains.Adnan was born in the UK, his spouse is German. We put a question to him, hoping for insight: During and after WW2, nations in Europe fought bitterly, even viciously, and political and ethnic boundaries were drawn, erased, redrawn. Yet, they have been able to function collectively, even build an EU that is close to borderless – even after Brexit – without the fallout of the hatred and killing in the 1940s. How did they reintegrate while the subcontinent still simmers in the animosity of the 1940s? ""It's a very interesting question, which I have pondered over."" He pauses for a bit.""And I think, I mean it's just my opinion... When Germany finally woke up and realised the horror of what their leaders had done... you see, the Nazis and Hitler, in particular, with the level of oratory skills that he had, had managed to convince the masses of their superiority, the Aryan race and the white supremacy that he had advocated and the illusions that he had created that we are going to take over the world – all of that came tumbling down at the defeat. And thereafter, with the entire world teaming up against Germany and telling them what a horrid leader they had, and the horror that he inflicted upon humanity and so on, somewhere the Germans realised ki yaar humne waaqyi bahut zyadti ki hai. Therefore, they were on an extreme back foot and they admitted defeat, they accepted humiliation and with that acceptance, they went and sought forgiveness. And when that happened, you know, humanity is such that when you do have that closure whereby the other person has admitted their mistake, things settle... If you speak to a German and you start talking about Nazis, the average German is gonna feel very embarrassed because of his history. I know this because I live there... live in the sense that I have got family there and as a result I have German friends. I know this. Today if you mention Hitler, they will feel very ashamed because they've realised what a monster he was. Now, in comparison, yahan pe there has been no such thing. Nobody has accepted defeat, nobody has accepted their mistake, nobody has turned around and made any apologies. Every time there has been a possibility of a handshake, the Pakistan Army decides to step in and do a Kargil or whatever in order to sabotage any possibility of reconciliation. It doesn't suit them to have a reconciliation because then it's going to have repercussions on their economy.""Even his Padma award became a discussion about India and Pakistan. ""When has there ever not been a discussion of India-Pakistan?"" he laughs. ""That is a perpetual discussion going on ever since Partition; it's not a new phenomenon"".That may be true, but Hindu-Muslim, majority-minority has perhaps not been as much of a perpetual discussion as it seems to be presently. As someone who moved from a 'majority' status to a 'minority' one by choice, what learnings and experiences does he have to share with us? How has been his association with those not of his faith after he moved to India?""When it comes to my relationship with people in India, I have, frankly speaking, never been able to differentiate in my day to day dealings with people from different walks of life. I am not even able to sometimes tell what faith they belong to unless somewhere in the conversation or at the end of the conversation, the person turns around and says Allah hafiz or Khuda hafiz. I will only then get to know that he might be a Muslim. I have so many friends who are Hindu but they will say Khuda hafiz to me. There is no difference ki main goodbye kahoon ya namaskar kahoon ya Khuda hafiz kahoon, mere liye ek hi hai.""And that does not make either of the two parties traitors to their respective cultures, does it?""Of course not, of course not!” He exclaims. ""The most beautiful thing in our country is that a Hindu will celebrate Eid with me, I will celebrate Diwali or Holi with him and all of us collectively will celebrate Christmas. Mere bahut saare dost joh Hindu hain woh Eid ke dauran aake kehte hain, ' achha yaar sevaiyaan bhej rahe ho na?' ya 'biryani bhej rahe ho na?'. Aur hum unki Diwali ki mithaai bade shauk se khaate hain. And now that Medina (his daughter) is with us, I was telling my wife that next year we must have a Christmas tree in the house. It's just such a beautiful thing for the child.""What faith will Medina grow up to embrace? Will she be able to celebrate both Eid and Christmas or is that no longer politically correct in the times the world is living in?“My child will grow up just like me. She will be able to embrace all and respect all faiths because that’s the way I have been brought up. When I was studying in England, in boarding school, the day used to start with the entire school going to the chapel. I grew up with all of those different faiths. My upbringing instilled in me to respect all faiths because at the end of the day, if you look at all faiths, the basic teaching of every faith is the same, love thy neighbour, don’t do to others what you wouldn’t have done to yourself. Which faith turns around and says that make sure that you sleep with your belly full while your neighbour is hungry? So these are the principles with which I intend to bring up Medina and that’s the way it should be.”""The most beautiful thing in our country is that a Hindu will celebrate Eid with me, I will celebrate Diwali or Holi with him and all of us collectively will celebrate Christmas,"" says Adnan Sami How do these principles play out in real life, beyond the words?“I had gone to Israel just last year and I went to Jerusalem, I visited Masjid-E-Aqsa, I visited the Wailing Wall, which is for the Jews, and I also went on the ziyarat of Jesus Christ and paid my respects in all of these different places with the same sanctity. So that’s the way I am. Jab yahan pe Ganpati hota hai toh humein har taraf se daawatein aati hain ki please come and visit us and we go. The point is that you respect all faiths. You may have your own principles or your own beliefs but that doesn’t mean that you cannot respect somebody else’s beliefs. To each his own. That’s the way I have been brought up and that is also the most beautiful thing about our country that we respect this,” concludes the expressive musician, who often reiterates that art is beyond politics.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73870376,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-108446/73870376.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/adnan-sami-you-may-have-your-own-principles-or-your-own-beliefs-but-that-doesnt-mean-that-you-cannot-respect-somebody-elses-beliefs/articleshow/73870043.cms

The ring ceremony was inspired by a Catholic wedding, with the bride wearing a white gown and the groom sporting a tuxedo.On the wedding day, Anurag wore a cream-coloured sherwani with a matching safa, while Nandini wore a red lehenga. She even got emotional and teary-eyed as she walked towards the mandap. Anurag said, “The feeling of being married is yet to sink in. I have known Nandini for five years now and we are good friends.

18,['3/02/2020'],Disha Patani: I am a tomboy at heart and I go back to being that every single day,"On the internet, she appears to be a diva. In person, she’s a tomboy who loves wearing her hair messily, slips into comfy and functional clothes and hops across to a cafe to get herself a cuppa coffee. In a chat with BT, Disha Patani talks about living life on the edge, her social media image, why it’s important to strike a balance between work and life and of course, her sizzling chemistry with co-star Aditya Roy Kapur in Mohit Suri ’s upcoming film, ' Malang '. Read on...I hope the year goes well. Even after doing a few films, I feel like a newcomer. With every film that works, expectations rise, which is a little daunting. For instance, I love dancing, but when I do it on screen, it’s not for myself. I don’t pick up choreography easily; I rehearse a lot to perfect it. I have to keep my body energised, monitor my diet and put in hours on the floor, but when the results are great, it’s relieving.(Laughs!) I actually enjoy working out. There’s no better feeling than not having backaches. I have bruised my knees so many times that today, I know the value of keeping my leg muscles in order. Fitness plays a different role in my life. I am sure people think that I do it so I can look a certain way, but with the kind of lives we lead, it’s just so important to stay healthy all the time. I work hard on my body all the time and it makes my dance and action look effortless.Yes, I knew him socially before we started working together. We had met many years ago in a gym where we would workout together. It was a little awkward to meet him as a co-star. If you’ve known someone for a long time, it becomes weird to act with them. In Aditya’s case, it was fun. As buddies, off camera, we took each other’s case. As actors, it was important to get rid of the awkwardness while performing passionate or deeply romantic scenes with conviction. In our case, we just acted our parts out without any strategy in place. We didn’t even chat about the scenes; we just took the plunge. Talking about them would have been stranger.We had very little training for it. Water-surfing and kitesurfing can be difficult; in fact, the latter can be life-threatening, as you could bang yourself into a tree or die in a road mishap because it entirely relies on the kite and the wind. You need years of training to perfect it. Water-surfing is relatively easier. On one occasion, I had to jump from a hill into the water. I was shaking the first time I had to do it for the camera. I injured my head and was hard of hearing for the whole day. I had almost died when I tried that from a smaller height in a swimming pool as a kid. So, it all looks like we were having fun, but it was stressful. Personally, I love doing crazy things but here, we were pushed to just do everything without much training.I don’t read much of what’s written about me. Not following news updates just keeps me peaceful. I’ve always kept my life away from the work I do. In this industry, wherever you go, people talk shop. You need to balance that with a simple life where you go back home to other normal things. We’re not just actors, we’re human beings, too. My friends and I don’t talk work when we meet, even though some of us are in the same business. We play video games and chill. When I’m not working, I walk into cafes and buy coffee for myself. I’m usually in messy, relaxed, workout clothes, with no make-up and hair tied in a bun or something. Dressing up is like a little break from that, when I want to be my cute or pretty self. At heart, I am a tomboy and I go back to being that every single day.I don’t Google myself, so I don’t know who says what. Earlier I thought that I’m an actor and my job is to just play a part. But actually, I also have to be entertaining when I meet people, and say these cool and funny things. I’m a boring person and I find it very hard to be funny and gimmicky. As for clothes, at the beginning of the career, you want to dress up and look a certain way. With time, you realise it doesn’t matter. No matter what you do, people will always have something to say. The idea is to be yourself and do what you like.Not entirely, but in some way I can say that I have. The decision to come to Mumbai, opting for a career in modelling and acting over completing B.Tech was like living on the edge. I am not as young as I was in those days. I was more carefree then and I made decisions which probably, I wouldn’t make today. The decisions worked for me, but now, I am relatively playing it safe. The older you grow the more you start thinking. Of course, sometimes it’s best not to think and go for what your heart says. What’s the worst that can happen? You have to strike a balance between these two spaces — being on the edge and playing it safe. I live alone here, all by myself with my dogs and cats, who are my responsibilities.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75/47529300.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/disha-patani-i-am-a-tomboy-at-heart-and-i-go-back-to-being-that-every-single-day/articleshow/73872311.cms

Titled Mere Liye Tum Kafi Ho, the soulful number is picturised on the lead couple in the film — Ayushmann Khurrana and Jitendra Kumar . The track, which releases tomorrow, has been composed by Tanishq Bagchi and Vayu, and sung by Ayushmann.The actor-singer says, “Mere Liye Tum Kafi Ho is conversational and at the same time, takes the narrative forward. It brings out the chemistry between the two boys.”He adds, “This is just another love song between two people, and that could be between two men, two women or a man and a woman. There is no difference, because the idea is to break stereotypes and normalise it as much as possible.”Talking about lending his voice to this track, he adds, “By default, I sing one song in the soundtrack of my films, because I love to sing. Besides, when you are lending your voice to your character, it sounds more credible and believable. For me, the criteria to choose a song — whether it is in Hindi, Punjabi or any other language — is that it should connect with me. I have a certain voice texture that goes well with soft romantic numbers. I love singing Punjabi songs, but lately, most of my songs have been Hindi or Urdu, including Ik Mulaqaat from 'Article 15' and now, this one.”The film directed by Hitesh Kewalya also features Neena Gupta and Gajraj Rao , among others.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73870604,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-83364/73870604.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/shubh-mangal-zyada-saavdhans-new-song-celebrates-romance/articleshow/73870608.cms
20,['3/02/2020'],"Between 2 tax regimes, no one will be worse off: Revenue secretary","NEW DELHI: Explaining the rationale to offer taxpayers a choice between a flat rate and an itemised deduction system, the government on Sunday said the new income tax rates would not make anyone worse off and the move allowed taxpayers to decide which regime suited them depending on their interests.In an interview with TOI , revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said the government’s move would benefit a large section of population, such as seniors who did not want to park money in tax-saving instruments and had paid down housing loans or youngsters just joining the workforce. Such people do not have substantial amounts to purchase life covers or deposit money in public provident fund (PPF).Data available with the tax department showed that of the around 5.8 crore people who filed returns for fiscal year 2018-19, 5.3 crore claimed income tax deductions of less than Rs 2 lakh, including deduction under section 80C of the Income Tax Act (for provident fund, PPF, life insurance premium), section 80D (mediclaim insurance), section 80CCD(1B) (additional deduction for National Pension Scheme ), deduction for housing loan interest and standard deduction .The Budget announcement of a new structure, promising lower income tax rates for those who give up exemptions with allowances such as HRA and leave travel added to their income, has generated considerable debate. While the government says the move will benefit a large section, analysts say a significant part of the salaried middle-class may not gain by transitioning to the new system.“We see that a meagre 3.77 lakh taxpayers have claimed deductions exceeding Rs 4 lakh... the choice is with the taxpayers — choose the old regime or the new one. Not a single taxpayer is going to lose in the process,” Pandey said, adding that the proposed system would make life simpler for those who opted for it. He said the assumption that all exemptions be taken into account for all slabs did not reflect in actual filings.He said the government would need more resources to ensure that all or most taxpayers are better off. The current exercise is estimated to result in a Rs 40,000 crore loss. “Ideally, we should bring down the tax rate to a level that everyone benefits. Given fiscal constraints, this is not possible,” Pandey said, adding that the government may lower rates and wipe out exemptions when revenues stabilise.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73882404,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1568872,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/between-2-tax-regimes-no-one-will-be-worse-off-revenue-secretary/articleshow/73882403.cms
21,['3/02/2020'],Nirbhaya case convicts testing India’s patience: Centre,"NEW DELHI: The Centre told the Delhi HC on Sunday the four Nirbhaya case convicts were “trying to test the patience of the nation” and pressed for a stay on an order postponing their hanging. Citing the 2019 gangrape and murder of a Hyderabad vet after which the four accused were killed by police in an alleged encounter and subsequent public celebrations, Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “It shows people losing faith in the criminal justice-delivery system.”On Saturday, the court had issued a notice to the four convicts — Mukesh Singh , Vinay Sharma , Akshay Thakur and Pawan Gupta — to respond to government’s plea seeking their immediate execution and setting aside of the trial court’s order staying the hanging scheduled for February 1.The Centre accused the convicts of adopting delaying tactics to delay the inevitable. It said the convicts had committed an “abhorrent” act and its logical conclusion of a death sentence was confirmed by all courts.Mehta revisited the night of the crime and highlighted the cruelty inflicted upon the woman and how she was thrown off a bus and left to die on the road. In his opinion, a convict with sheer, calculated inaction, in tandem with other convicts, could frustrate the process of law. The Centre’s counsel also argued that seven years had passed but the convicts were still “playing” with the machinery of the judicial system.Arguing on the point of the legal remedy of a mercy plea before the President, he said such a plea could be decided differently for different convicts. “Mercy jurisdiction is an individualistic jurisdiction. They can’t rely on the mercy plea with the President and say if one convict’s mercy is allowed, there could be a change of circumstances for the others,” Mehta argued.This point was vehemently opposed by senior advocate Rebecca John , who represented convict Mukesh Singh. “Assuming that the President was to pardon one person, to say that it won’t have an effect on me is absolutely wrong,” she added.John asked where the Centre was all this while during the warrant proceedings and why it had only “woken up” yesterday. “We are taking a life from a human being… And, therefore, the Constitution gives me the option of legal remedies. You keep saying delay, delay, delay... but you (Centre) never entered the trial court. Even death-row convicts have rights. They have rights to use their remedies and use it till their last breath of their lives,” she submitted.She also asked if Delhi government had moved court seeking issuance of a death warrant in the last several years. John, who appeared along with advocate Vrinda Grover , objected to the Centre moving the high court challenging the order of the postponement of the hangings when it ought to have gone to Supreme Court. She underlined an argument given by the high court in an earlier order about how the trial court was taking the view of Supreme Court in connection with the hanging to a logical end.John, therefore, argued that when the first date of execution was sought to be stayed in view of a mercy plea, the high court had stated that it could not decide any grievance with respect to the death warrants. “When I, a death row convict, was asked to approach Supreme Court... the same rule applies to the other party as well. This petition is not maintainable before the high court,” she said.The victim’s family had moved the trial court seeking issuance of death warrants in December 2018 and John stated that from that time till January 2020, the Centre was never a party to the warrant proceedings. “This is the first time [sic] Union of India has superimposed themselves in these proceedings. What's their locus and why they have done so is a matter of court to examine,” she said.John also submitted when the trial court set February 1, 2020, as the date of hanging on January 17, it set the time for all four convicts and not one. “It didn’t bifurcate the dates... What is the tearing hurry? The execution could happen at any point in time — whether a few days, or a week or a month. I’m a making a statement against myself. I’m the most horrible person, committed most heinous crime, but I am still protected under Article 21,” John said.The high court reserved its order after the arguments.In Video: Nirbhaya case: Delhi HC reserves order on Centre's plea challenging stay on execution of 4 death row convicts",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73882458,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-842401,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nirbhaya-case-convicts-testing-indias-patience-centre/articleshow/73882433.cms

ALAPPUZHA/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala reported the country’s second novel coronavirus case on Sunday, with a male student of a university in Wuhan admitted to Alappuzha medical college hospital testing positive for the virus . The first case, that of a woman medical student who is undergoing treatment, was reported in Thrissur on Thursday.State health minister K K Shailaja told reporters after a meeting in Alappuzha that the second person who tested positive — one among four admitted to the isolation ward at Alappuzha medical college hospital — had returned to Kerala on January 24. “Three of those admitted were studying in China while the fourth person is a relative of one of them. We are waiting for test reports of the others,” she said.Shailaja said there was no need for panic as the condition of both patients was stable.The health department received the test result of the infected person from National Institute of Virology, Pune, on Sunday afternoon. “Neither of the two patients has developed any serious complications. There is nothing to panic but we need to be vigilant. The department is strictly monitoring the situation so that the virus does not spread from them,” Shailaja said.The Kerala health department has put 1,924 people under observation at their homes and 75 have been admitted to isolation wards in various hospitals. Till now, 104 samples of suspected cases have been sent for tests. Of these, 36 results have been received and two tested positive. In Alappuzha, four persons have also been admitted to the general hospital.All those coming from China are under health department surveillance. “The only request to people is that if anyone who has come from China recently has not reported to the nearby health centre so far, they should immediately do so,” Shailaja said.The Union health ministry and the India Council of Medical Research have permitted the Kerala unit of National Institute of Virology in Alappuzha to conduct tests for coronavirus. “Though we have facilities, we were not supposed to conduct the tests. There was a delay in getting test results from Pune NIV,” Shailaja said.Wuhan in China is the ground zero of the virus outbreak which had infected over 14,500 people and led to 305 deaths till Sunday evening. Despite strong measures to contain the outbreak, including the Chinese government locking down Wuhan and adjoining cities in Hubei province, the virus continues to spread rapidly.Apart from China, the virus has been detected in at least 21 countries, including India.Amid mounting fear of a wider spread, the Union health ministry has asked hospitals across all states and Union territories to prepare isolation wards.In Video: Second case of coronavirus confirmed in Kerala on Sunday",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73883387,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-999159,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kerala-confirms-2nd-coronavirus-case-patient-stable/articleshow/73882968.cms

BIHARSHARIF: Irked over the murder of a JD(U) member, Amit Vashisht , in Sheikhpura village on Saturday night, party workers and supporters set on fire a religious place in Sheikhpura on Sunday. Local residents and police doused the fire that left the shrine partially damaged. The protesters also raised anti-administration slogans.

According to reports, a large number of supporters of Amit Vashisht alias Nand Kishore Kushwaha blocked a road near in Sheikhura by burning tyres on Sunday morning and disrupted movement of traffic for hours. Soon after, a group of protesters went to Dallu Chowk where they set on fire a shrine. They also forced the shopkeepers to down their shutters.

A local resident, Ranjeet Kumar , said the protesters were demanding action against those involved in the attack on the JD(U) member and left the place but returned soon to block the road and attacked the shrine after rumour spread that another injured person Mintu Kumar, who was sent to PMCH for treatment, had died there. The second death was neither confirmed nor denied by any official.

According to sources, police picked up several persons but have withheld names. It is also learnt that police took into custody the main culprit who was being treated at Sheikhpura sadar hospital. No arrests have been made for damaging the shrine.

The police later carried out a flag march to instill confidence in residents of some localities. The officials also assured the protesters that they would ensure early arrest of those involved in the attack. Sheikhura SP Daya Shankar who, along with other police officers, was camping at the village where the situation is said to be tense.

The JD(U) member was killed in a clash that broke out between two groups over a DJ during an immersion procession of Goddess Saraswati in the village late on Saturday. Over 15 persons sustained injuries from both the sides. A critically injured Mintu Kumar was sent to PMCH after first aid. The SP said that an FIR has been lodged against 12 people in connection with the murder and five of the accused have been held so far.

28,['3/02/2020'],"No more whispers about menstrual hygiene in UP, thanks to Gujarat woman","This story is from February 3, 2020

Bedekar’s journey started in 2010 when she and her husband Shyam launched a startup ‘Sakhi’.

LUCKNOW: Bollywood might have captured the story of Coimbatore’s Arunachalam Muruganantham whose ideas revolutionised menstrual hygiene in India with the film ‘Padman’, but there are unsung heroes like Swati Bedekar whose concept of low-cost organic sanitary napkins and their eco-friendly disposal has enabled women in UP lead more carefree lives.

The Vadodara native is credited with installing sanitary vending machines in several schools of Mirzapur, Ghazipur, Noida and Agra. These machines dispense organic napkins made from bio-degradable raw materials.

Bedekar’s journey started in 2010 when she and her husband Shyam launched a startup ‘Sakhi’ to establish low-cost sanitary napkin manufacturing units.

The couple set up their first unit in Uttar Pradesh in Ghazipur in December 2018.

“These pads consist of an absorbent sheet made from banana stem fiber. These ‘green pads’ are made at our units in Ghazipur and Mirzapur,” said Bedekar, who won the ‘Best Grassroot Innovation Award’ in 2015 from then-President Pranab Mukherjee .

Each of these units produces 1,200-2,000 napkins every day, which are priced at Rs 2.50 apiece. “We employ local rural women in these low-cost units, which also gives them a way to earn. They’re paid 50 paise per pad,” said the former science educator.

The training module for the women employed by Sakhi’s units has been designed by Bedekar’s husband.

What’s more, is that the terracotta incinerators installed by Bedekar and her small army of volunteers in government schools have ensured that these young girls do not have to sneak out to dispose of sanitary pads.

Called ‘Ashudhinashak’(destroyer of impurities), these incinerators ensure that sanitary pads are disposed of in an environmentally sustainable manner.

Once the pads are dumped in the incinerator, they are burned. The ash produced is absorbed by the soil and goes on to nourish plants. Currently, such incinerators have been installed in government schools of four districts.

“These devices do not spread foul odor, prevent spread of bacterial diseases and turns disposed napkins into ash without spreading smoke,” the 54-year-old added.

Bedekar ropes in local potters to manufacture these terracotta incinerators.

“Manufacturing Ashudhdhinashak costs just Rs 1,500 and just one of these devices can cater to over 100 women.”

Before heading to UP, the Bedekars have established similar units in several villages of Gujarat, Maharashtra , Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and West Bengal .

Today, her efforts have even won her global recognition.

She has also helped set up similar units in refugee settlements in Jordan, Cameroon , South Africa and Bhutan.

According to experts, sanitary napkins take between 500 and 800 years to decompose. Experts say that an average Indian woman in urban areas throws away more than 10,000 sanitary pads in her lifetime.

Coimbatore: Residents of VCP Thayammal Layout on Monday requested the district administration to vacate a family that has encroached the open space reserve (OSR) land of the layout.

A group of residents including children, who came to the district collectorate, said that the 48-site layout has an OSR site of nine cents. “We had used the site to conduct social activities like health camps. We also set up a shed for children to play,” said K Kavitha.

Now the residents want to build a toilet for the children coming to the adjoining integrated child development services (ICDS) centre, a compound wall around the reserve site and a park. “However, an individual has been occupying the south side of the site since 1986,” said Kavitha. “After residents moved court regarding the encroachment, the court said that the land does not belong to the encroacher. When the encroacher appealed, his suit was dismissed. Despite this, the corporation is yet to evict him. Also, his tenants, who run a workshop in the area, are creating noise and air pollution in the residential area.”

“Ward 96 has been declared a model ward under the smart cities mission. But we can’t even remove an encroacher,” Kavitha added.

30,['3/02/2020'],‘Groundwater extraction can affect earth’s surface’,"This story is from February 3, 2020

KOCHI: Researchers at marine geology department of the Cochin University of Science and Technology ( Cusat ) in a recent issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research have found that the Indo-Gangetic Plain and sub-Himalayan region are showing a fall in land level by 2.40mm/yr. They say that this subsidence is related to seasonal variations in the monsoon and the heavy groundwater extraction.

This is also accompanied by the northward movement of the Indian continental plate, said that study which used geological GPS of a decade from 2005-2015.

“This is not a one-off phenomenon in just that region. It could have its bearings in Kerala and the Indian peninsular region too, which is moving, and could trigger tremors in the state’s reservoir areas and coastal zones,” said P S Sunil, head, department of marine geology and geophysics.

He said that in addition to the tectonic and non-tectonic forces, unsustainable consumption of groundwater associated to irrigation and other anthropogenic uses influence the subsidence rate in the IGP and sub-Himalaya.

“At least 12% of the sub-surface disturbances have been triggered by anthropogenic (man-made) activities. Studies have shown that they are responsible for earthquake generation in that region. A similar disturbance in the earth’s sub-surface is causing the sinking of Kerala’s Mundrothuruthu,” Sunil said.

Sunil, who began the study while he was with the Indian Institute of Geomagnetism, said that the tectonic movement which is bringing the Eurasian and Indian continental plates closer is triggering major earthquakes in the Himalayan region, the latest one that recorded 7 on the Richter scale in Nepal in 2015.

Recently, the science and engineering research board (SERB), department of science and technology (DST), cleared a project to monitor the crustal and dam deformations induced by seasonal loading and unloading of Idukki reservoir in Kerala using ground and space geodetic techniques.

“I will be establishing monitoring stations in the Idukki dam to understand the cracks in the arch dam caused by water loading. The structure would have a strain accumulation due to the loading. We will observe and then make a model to understand the mechanism or disturbances triggered by the hydrological loading,” he said.

When a crack forms on the sub-surface, these form rivers, and dams are built on these rivers. “These cracks are calls fault lines and so it is expected that a slight tremor could induce reservoir earthquakes,” he said.

Sunil said that beneath the top brittle surface, the earth is elastic and when water percolates in the monsoon, it triggers elastic activity. Movement of the techtonic plate could trigger small tremors in the reservoir and also cause changes in the coastal areas in the peninsular regions.

Coimbatore: The Race Course police have filed a case against K Raja Hussain, district president of Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), and the organiser of the federation of all Jamaths and Muslim organisations which took out the anti-CAA rally on Sunday, and others in connection with the rally , for ‘causing disturbance to general public and traffic’.

SDPI members condemned this as they had obtained prior permission to take out the rally.

Cases have been filed against him under the sections 143 (punishment for unlawful assembly) and 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) of the Indian Penal Code. Police said the members of Coimbatore district all Jamaths and Islamic Organisations had on Sunday ‘assembled unlawfully and staged agitation condemning the implementation of CAA’.

The federation of all Muslim organisations, political outfits and Jamaths, took out a massive rally against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) on Sunday from Ukkadam bus stand till Red Cross Building near South Taluk Office in the city. Women, children, youngsters and people across all age groups had participated in the rally. Representatives of churches and political leader also participated.

Police sources said around 20,000 people participated in the rally. Around 5,000 police personnel were pressed into service for safety. While the rally was organised with police protection and prior permission, police sources said the number in the crowd had exceeded their estimate.

Raja Hussain told TOI that the case has been registered due to ‘pressure’ from certain quarters. “We had held talks with the police one week prior regarding the rally and had taken out the rally only in the allowed route. We did not cause trouble or indulge in any unlawful activity. Police had given permission for the rally. Now it is not fair to file cases against us. We will reason it out with the police and also face the case legally,” he said.

On Monday, passengers who landed in the city after travelling to any of the above four countries were given hand sanitizers and masks.

Commuters driving into the district from Kerala, have been made aware of the virus, symptoms and ways to prevent its spread.

“ A desk has also been set up for commuters to get their doubts cleared about the virus and who they should contact or approach if they have symptoms,” said Deputy Director of Health Services G Ramesh Kumar.

So far 72 people have been home quarantined in the city to watch for symptoms, however hardly one of them had a cough. No one’s throat swab samples have been sent to be tested for the dreaded Coronavirus yet.

Besides, the District Health Department also held a meeting at Isha Yoga Centre to educate foreigners in the city about the precautions that need to be taken for the novel Coronavirus (nCoV).

The foreigners were told to stay quarantined after a thorough screening, even though they do not contain any symptoms of nCoV infections.

Meanwhile, an isolation ward was created at the ESI Hospital for people with Coronavirus symptoms.

Udhagamandalam: A group of farmers staged a protest at Jakkalodai village near Kotagiri on Monday urging the Centre to fix minimum support price of Rs 30 for green leaf tea and give ‘Scheduled Tribes’ tag for the Badaga community.

The protesters, who belong to the Nakkubetta Farmers’ Welfare Association, said around 50,000 small tea cultivators have been demanding a minimum support price for green leaf tea for more than a decade, but in vain.

While the Madras high court had directed the Centre to fix the minimum support price above the production costs, nothing has been done yet, they said.

President of the association Ramanan said the price fixed by the tea board for green leaf tea is between Rs 12 and Rs 13 per kg. “Even the labour cost could not be compenstated with the price. Then there are the maintenance cost and money for the farmers to run their family,” he said.

While the processed tea is sold minimum at Rs 400 per kg, it is only the farmers who are the receiving end, he added.

The Indian Institute of Plantation Management, Bengaluru, conducted a survey in 2013 and submitted a report to the government. It stated that the minimum cost of production of green leaf tea would be around Rs 17. After adding 50 percent of that to the social cost of a farmer, the minimum support price should fall between Rs 25 and Rs 27 per kg.

Besides, the protesters also urged the Centre to give ‘Schedule Tribes’ tag for the Badaga community, whose members are mostly small tea farmers. “The Badaga community came under Schedule Tribes before the Independence. However, after the Independence the community was classified as the backward class for reasons not known,” he said, adding, “It is a blunder made by the government. We have been fighting to regain the status for the past 30 years.”

Ramanan warned that protest will continue in every village in the Nilgiris until the Centre heeds to their demands and said a massive district-level rally would also be conducted soon.

Thiruvananthapuram: Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac slammed the Centre for slashing down the revenue share of state governments for political reasons, and breaking the essence of federal structure of the country.

Replying to a calling attention motion moved by CPM MLA K Suresh Kurup, the finance minister said that the Centre has this year slashed the state’s share almost by Rs 12,000 crore, citing various reasons. He said that the state will approach other states with similar issues, and explore the possibility of moving legally against the Centre’s actions. He said that the while the finance commission had recommended that Rs 74,000 crore should be earmarked for covering the revenue deficit of the state, the Centre had only earmarked Rs 30,000 crore, which would mean that the state’s share would be much less than what was actually demanded by the finance commission.

Isaac said the Centre also slashed the limit of external borrowing of the state by citing that the treasury deposits of the state have increased. While moving the calling attention motion, Kurup said that Centre’s revengeful attitude towards the state has pushed the state into deep crisis. He said that even the compensation for GST for which the state is eligible has been blocked without even informing the state.

He said that the compensation since November is pending, and the external borrowings was limited to Rs 16,000 crore instead of the eligible Rs 25,000 crore. He said that the Centre had refused to provide any financial aid during the time of floods and also declined to allow the state to accept aid from other countries.

NEW DELHI: Air India ’s second evacuation flight flew in 323 Indians and seven citizens of Maldives from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic, to Delhi on Sunday morning. The total number of people brought in the two flights is 654 — 647 Indians and seven foreigners. The jumbo jets used for this special operation, Ajanta and Agra, are now being fumigated and will be used for regular commercial flights after they are fully disinfected.

With both these aircraft being over 25 years old, AI took critical spare parts like tyres on the flights from Delhi with engineers to minimise the chance of their getting grounded there for technical reasons. Captain Amitabh Singh , AI’s director (operations), was on both the back-to-back flights to supervise the evacuation. He and another AI employee, Sanjay Gupta , were the only two people on both the flights. “Flying into Wuhan on the first flight was like witnessing apocalypse. As soon as we exited the international overflying routes in China to head to Wuhan, there was no other air traffic there at that time. On landing, we saw planes parked with their engines sealed off. It was eerie,” Captain Singh told TOI.

The airline’s control centre in Delhi was constantly tracking the flights.

AI staff who fumigated these aircraft were also given a full protection suit to do the job. Both Ajanta and Agra will be ready to operate as per regular schedule by Tuesday.

Bhopal: Expect everyday water supply in the summer season this year. Instead of drawing more water from the Upper Lake, the district administration has proposed a plan to draw the requisite additional water from Kolar and Kerwa reservoirs.

After a gap of almost four years, all the water bodies including Upper Lake were full to their capacities in 2019.

An excess drawing of water — 10 MCM Kolar and 3.42 MCM from Kerwa — should suffice the daily water needs for the entire city including Bairagarh and areas under the BMC. It would be worked out in coordination with Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC), MP Pollution Control Board, discom and revenue department, as proposed in the plan. A meeting to this effect was chaired by Bhopal divisional commissioner Kalpana Shrivastava. If the plan succeeds, it would be first time in many years that the city residents would get daily water supply from March to June.

Implementation report for the proposal will be reviewed in last week of February. It includes construction of Shahjehanabad pump house that would ensure uninterrupted water supply to Bairagarh.

Focus has also been laid on filtration of chlorination of drinking water. Repair of drinking water supply lines and preventing leakages has also been proposed.

Construction work on the land allotted for sewage treatment plant has been scheduled to be completed by March. In pursuance of the decision of the NGT, bio-remediation of water from drains is also being worked out.

BHOPAL: A Tikamgarh youth was sentenced to 14-year rigorous imprisonment for raping a minor after marrying her at a temple in Indore . Assistant district prosecution officer PP Patel said, “In the sentence pronounced on January 31, a special court for POCSO act did not consider the marriage consent given by the minor and found him guilty of raping her.”

He said that the case dates back to April 2018 when a man in Tikamgarh had lodged a police complaint about his missing daughter. Father of the minor, Patel said, owns a shop and he had told police that the accused would visit his shop quite often. “On April 25 2018 , he reported the matter of the missing girl with Dehat police station”, he said.

Further investigation revealed that Mahendra Kushwah, a resident of Tikamgarh, had eloped with the girl and married her at a temple in Indore. But as the girl is a minor, their physical relationship was treated as a rape, Patel said. The DNA report confirmed the rape.

As the girl is a minor, the court refused to consider her consent for marriage and sentenced the youth to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment and slapped Rs 10,000 fine under section 5/6 of the POCSO act 2012, Patel said.

Nagpur: As admission season for free seats under the 25% Right To Education (RTE) quota nears, a city-based education activist has demanded that the government first fix the problem related to residential address mapping.

The map interface is integrated into the software and helps applicant parents/guardians to mark their home on Google maps, which is then considered for admissions. This is crucial because in RTE admission, distance is a major criteria as the one who lives the closest to schools gets priority.

Education activist Shahid Sharif said, “The software needs a complete overhaul as many people are facing problem while submitting the form. In the application form when the map interface opens, applicant has to place the balloon on their residence after which the actual distance is calculated automatically.”

Sharif had complained to the education department last year as well but says nothing has been done yet. “If the software is faulty then how can it be taken up for admissions? Every year I have parents complaining about this issue, but nothing happens,” said Sharif.

An education department official who did not wish to be identified said that it can’t be a software-related error. “If there is a glitch then thousands of parents should have been affected. But since the number is so low, it is clear that there is a manual error happening from applicants’ side. While placing the balloon it is possible that it does not drop on exactly the same location as intended thus creating a problem,” said the official.

Once the RTE lottery is done, the software allocates seats to students and parents have to complete the admission formalities based on that. Hardly a few schools check the actual place where the applicant is staying as for them it does not matter if ‘A’ takes admission or ‘B’.

They should have understood that those getting affected by their protest are lactating women, who are dependent on the government scheme. I reiterate that we don’t want to sack anyone and I still urge all the protesting workers to join back their centres.”Terming the government’s decision as “shocking”, president of Uttarakhand anganwadi workers’ union, Rekha Negi said, “Never in the history of the state had any government taken such a stringent action against those who are fighting to get justice”.“From teachers to roadways employees to bank employees, all protest for their rights. But this has happened for the first time that people fighting for genuine rights are being punished like this. If the government thinks they can deter us, they are wrong. This time, either we will get justice or we will lay down our lives,” said Negi adding that the protesting workers will be approaching all the opposition parties to garner support for their struggle.Meanwhile, Congress state vice-president Suryanaknt Dhasmana, who met the anganwadi workers on Sunday, said that his party will support them.“This government has become immune to public dissent. We will be taking their fight to the next level,” Dhasmana added.The state has over 20,000 anganwadi centres in 13 districts, in which 33,850 anganwadi workers, their assistants and helpers, work.

The central government’s ministry of housing and urban affairs will decide the ranks of 114 cities, including Nagpur, on the basis of findings of the survey.

Mayor Sandip Joshi has urged people to participate in large numbers in the survey as marks also depend on the number of citizens of the total population that have participated in the survey. “NMC will also get to know the reaction of people towards its working and the standard of services. Feedback from people will help in improving the working and services of the NMC,” he said.

Chief executive officer of NSSCDCL, Ramnath Sonawane, said people have to participate in the survey online. “People have to scan the QR code of the Ease of Living Index Survey-2019 or visit eol2019.org/citizenfeedback. After that, one has to first select Maharashtra state followed by Nagpur city and give their opinion,” he said.

Of the total 114 cities, 12 from the state, including Nagpur, have been selected for the survey.

File photo

NEW DELHI: The government on Sunday clarified that the new provision on NRIs was not intended to include in the tax net Indian citizens who are bona fide workers in other countries , setting at rest apprehensions that the new rule may bring those working in the Gulf under the tax ambit.

The Finance Bill 2020 has proposed that an Indian citizen shall be deemed to be a resident in India if he is not liable to be taxed in any country or jurisdiction. The revenue department said this was an anti-abuse provision since it was found that some Indian citizens shifted their stay in low or no-tax jurisdictions to avoid paying tax in India.

“In some sections of media, the new provision is being interpreted to create an impression that those Indians who are bona fide workers in other countries, including in Middle East , and who are not liable to pay tax in these countries will be taxed in India on the income that they have earned there. This interpretation is not correct,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes said in a statement.

“In order to avoid any misinterpretation, it is clarified that in case of an Indian citizen who becomes deemed resident of India under this proposed provision, income earned outside India by him shall not be taxed in India unless it is derived from an Indian business or profession. Necessary clarification, if required, shall be incorporated in the relevant provision of the law,” the statement added.

The Budget had proposed that an Indian citizen not ‘liable to tax’ in any other country or territory shall be deemed to be resident in India. At first glance, it had appeared that India’s diaspora which works in Gulf countries (where there is no tax on individual income) would be badly hit.

However, the Finance Bill added that this would be the case if the individual is not liable to tax in any other country by reason of his domicile, or residence or any other criteria of similar nature.

The Union Budget , unveiled on Saturday, has tightened the screws on those seeking to escape tax by exploiting their non-resident status. While earlier it was possible to be classified as a non-resident by staying out of the country for 183 days — or about six months in a year — this has now been increased to 245 days.

NEW DELHI: A day after a 22-year-old man died after inhaling toxic fumes while another person fell unconscious while cleaning a sewer line near Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) Central Business District (CBD) in Shahdara , an inquiry committee was set up by DDA . However, the authority said it hadn’t assigned cleaning of any sewer in the area.

“The inquiry committee, headed by the chief engineer (east), will inquire into the incident,” a DDA spokesperson said. “It is clarified that neither the cleaning work of the sewer line had been assigned to any contractor or agency nor the persons cleaning the sewer line were engaged by DDA,” he added.

“As the sewer line has not yet been handed over to the Delhi Jal Board , therefore, DDA has decided to extend financial assistance to the families of the deceased and injured. DDA expresses its sympathy to the bereaved families of the deceased and injured,” he said.

DDA vice-chairman Tarun Kapoor told TOI that the body is quite concerned about the incident and has a lot of sympathy for the families. “Even though DDA did not assign this work, we will provide financial support to family of the deceased and the injured worker,” he said.

50,['3/02/2020'],"Vendors ‘raid’ NMC zone office, flee with goods seized during NDS drive","This story is from February 3, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) continued its crackdown on unauthorized roadside vegetable, fruit and meat markets for the second consecutive day on Sunday. Action was taken at 22 such places acting as weekly markets.

Later in the day, a group of vegetable and fruit vendors, supported by an influential politician, raided the NMC’s Mangalwari zone office and took away material seized during the drive on Saturday and Sunday morning.

As per policy framed by mayor Sandip Joshi to ease traffic congestion across the city, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe has launched the drive against unauthorized vendors selling their products on roads and footpaths.

After the incident, Mundhe has now called a meeting with NMC officials, traffic police and special branch to decide further course of action.

During the drive, which kicked off from 8am on Sunday, NMC’s Nuisance Detection Squad (NDS) personnel imposed Rs400 each fine on vendors and hawkers for causing unhygienic conditions and Rs5,000 for using banned plastic bags. The NDS also recovered fine from shopkeepers selling construction material by encroaching footpaths, which was appreciated by local residents.

The civic teams ensured that Sunday weekly markets were not held on roads at Khamla, Jaffar Nagar and a few more areas. Sheds erected by the vendors were removed using JCBs.

Action was also taken against unauthorized markets on WHC Road, Shatabdi Square, Beltarodi Road, Cotton Market, Trisharan Chowk, Manish Nagar T-point, Santra Market, Natraj Talkies, Azamshah Chowk, Satranjpura Square, Badkas Square, Pachpaoli, Jagnath Budhwari, Zade Chowk, Kabir Nagar, Pilli River area, Gol Bazaar, Mangalwari etc.

Officials said vendors should run their businesses only from markets approved by the NMC across the city. “Such unauthorized markets being operated on footpaths and roads lead to traffic congestion as vehicles and the vendors’ set up block almost half of the road,” they said.

Despite the crackdown in the day, a few vendors selling vegetables and fruits were back in the evening in Khamla, Jaffar Nagar, Gokulpeth and continued their business on footpaths and roads.

Many vendors met West Nagpur MLA and city Congress president Vikas Thakre and complained about the “assault on their livelihood”.

Thakre told TOI, “Action against encroachments is understandable, but not on markets which are running at the same place for years. NMC has failed to develop markets in many areas. It should ensure proper place for vendors before taking action. All markets should also have designated parking spaces. City has expanded and it is not possible for all to travel to Kalamna or Cotton Market to get vegetables. The NMC must take care of hundreds of vendors.”

Mundhe is known for stringent action against encroachments on footpaths and roads. He had undertaken similar drives in Navi Mumbai and Nashik etc. Considering his reputation as a no-nonsense officer, the mayor’s policy of ensuring hassle free footpaths and roads for citizens may work well, a few citizens hoped.

The new municipal commissioner is also likely to launch a drive against unauthorized constructions across the city.

Drive is anti-poor: Vendor

Nagpur: Uma Pande, a resident of Rathod Layout, has been dependent on Borgaon Road vegetable market for over two decades. Pande was shocked on Sunday when she didn’t find the sellers setting up stalls by the roadside. “We get all types of vegetables there and at affordable prices. I buy veggies from this market and stock up for the whole week, but today I had to go to Sadar,” she said.

A woman seller said she would suffer substantial loss if the stock remains unsold. “We had been selling vegetables here for over 10 years. We were not informed about the drive. We have never faced any problem while residents too like it to have all vegetables at same place. The drive is anti-poor,” she said.

Asad Hyder, a resident of Anant Nagar, supported the NMC though he too had to go some extra distance to buy vegetables. “The weekly market is good, but people shouldn’t be inconvenienced. Some sellers encroach the road and block traffic. This was going on for years,” he said.

Nagpur: The Madhya Pradesh and the Maharashtra forest department officials are in conflict after the former charged Deolapar forest range officials under Nagpur division with dumping carcass of a tigress that was found dead in their territory.

On December 11, tigress T-19, known as Sharmilee of Pench (MP) buffer, was found dead in Khandasa forest bordering Deolapar range of Maharashtra. T-19 used to shuffle between forest areas of Deolapar and MP Pench’s buffer. As the death was shrouded in mystery, the MP officials were investigating the case in detail.

Talking to TOI, RS Kori, chief conservator of forests (CCF), Seoni, said, on January 31, the officials picked up temporary forest labourer Dhamsingh Khandate, who worked in Deolapar, for interrogation during which he said that the round officer Salim Razzak Khan had asked him and staff to dump the carcass on the MP side.

Bullock cart of one Laxman Tekam was allegedly used to shift the carcass on the night of December 10. “When we reached the spot on December 11, there were trails of a bullock cart near the carcass. With no strong for cause of death, it was evident that the tigress died at some other spot and later dumped on MP side,” said Kori.

“Though exact cause of T-19 death is unknown, we have sent samples to various labs. From confession of Khandate, we have come to know that the tigress died on Maharashtra side,” Kori added.

CCF P Kalyan Kumar, Nagpur, said, “We have sought all the relevant papers from the MP officials to probe the allegations. Ramtek ACF Sandeep Giri will meet Kori and collect all papers on Monday. There are many gaps in the case which we need to investigate.”

“It is hard to believe the charge as forester Khan was one among the team that effectively monitored a tigress and three cubs in Deolapar range during last summer. We learnt about the allegations through media,” said Kumar.

Deolapar RFO SG Parihar, who was in Nagpur on Sunday to record statements of the team that was present at the spot, denied the charge as baseless. “Why cart owner has not been arrested till date? Why Khan himself has not arrested by taking Maharashtra officials into confidence? The MP officials are passing buck on us,” he said.

Parihar said, “The forest labourer was picked from his house and not arrested near Khawasa as claimed. The MP foresters were trailing him for the last 15-20 days and had visited him twice. It is after nearly two months they are claiming we are involved. When Khandate was arrested, Khan and others had gone to Kurai forest office they were not allowed to meet him. Now he has been renamed to judicial custody.”

52,['3/02/2020'],"Of 3-day extension, a day lost as GSTN portal shut for hrs","This story is from February 3, 2020

Nagpur: Even though government had extended GST returns deadline from January 31 to February 3, those who rushed to file it on the Budget day were left hassled as the GST Network (GSTN) portal was shut for maintenance.

The order extending the deadline came on the night of January 31. As professionals rushed to file the goods and services tax (GST) returns on Saturday, they found the portal closed for maintenance for over four hours. Though it opened by evening, almost entire day was wasted, said chartered accountants.

“Originally January 31 was the deadline, which was extended late in the night by 3, 5, and 7 days for different states. It was extended by three days for Maharashtra. However, as the server was closed for a considerable time on Saturday, the process was stalled. A number of documents have to be downloaded from the GSTN portal and loss of hours has now pushed back the work,” said chartered accountant Rajeev Damani.

“Messages are doing rounds that only 35% of the returns have been filed so far. For audit reports to be filed, the returns have to be filed first,” said Damani.

The extension was declared on a staggered basis for each state so that sudden load is not created on the server. If each state had the same deadline, the rush would have been more, said an official

As professionals are complaining, officials of GST department said the delay was from the taxpayers’ side also. Majority of the assessees rush to file return only when the deadline nears, clogging the system. As much as 50% of the annual returns have been filed, but audit reports under Form 9C are training. This means there is a delay from the chartered accountants’ side in submitting the audit reports, said an official.

Manish Shukla, chartered accountant, said the delay is also because the system itself does not accept beyond 1.5 lakh returns at a point of time. “The GSTN cannot be accessed once the number of applicants touches 1.5 lakh, and others have to wait in the queue. This delays the process leading to a last minute rush and eventual extension of last date,” he said.

Shukla said a recent circular which restricts the amount of input tax credit (ITC) till it is not reflected in the other party’s returns is also locking up businessmen’s funds. This is because ITC can only be filed in the next quarter after the purchaser files the returns.

54,['3/02/2020'],Low turnout of migratory birds at lakes disappoints birders,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Pic by Manka Behl

Nagpur: A few years ago, bird watchers in the region used to flock to water bodies and spend hours watching the winter migrants. But they are a disappointed lot this year due to drastic fall in their numbers.

Even as it is time to return for these avians, many hotspots have been devoid of the birds, which used to frequent the locations every year. Migratory birds would arrive in large numbers and water bodies would remain well populated with water birds as well as birders observing them.

“Over a period of last three years there has been a steep decline in the number of birds. The centre of attraction — the bar headed geese (BHG) — were seen in large numbers till recently, and their count used to be over 600. However, not more than 100 have been recorded this season,” says bird expert Nitin Marathe.

Marathe adds, “The low count of birds is following our visits to Saiki, Paradgaon, Khapri, Kolarmet, Sasegaon, Wadgaon, Wadegaon, Telhara, Dahegaon, Chargaon, Undri, and Mangli lakes in 40km vicinity of Nagpur over last month.”

“It is not only BHGs that have a low count, decline of ducks like red crested pochards is much more. At Vena lake, the count six years ago was over 5,000. This year I recorded mere seven. The only solace is Dahegaon lake in Mihan, where sizeable 50 pochards were recorded after a gap of two years,” says avid bird watcher Mayuresh Joshi.

Northern Shovellers, Northern Pintail ducks, Gadwal, Garganey, Coots, Common Pochards, Tufted ducks arrive in good numbers in this area but their presence too has declined.

“Small birds such as Wagtails, Plovers, Pratincoles, Barn Swallows, Blue Throat, Kestrel, Harrier are also showing a decline in numbers, though warblers, Black Red Start, Lesser White Throat have arrived as usual,” says Marathe.

Veteran bird expert Gopal Thosar, who is still engaged in bird watching, expressed serious concern over decline in number of birds. “One of the reasons must be loss in original breeding grounds in countries from where they arrive. This needs to be studied,” Thosar says.

Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board (MSBB) board member Jayant Wadatkar of Amravati admits, “The low count of birds is increasing. Due to prolonged rains, water bodies in the region are full. Birds avoid such lakes due to non-availability of food here. Decline of migratory birds is a global issue.”

“Water bodies are full due to late rains leaving less shore for the birds to rest. Besides, spurt in mining of silt, murrum, metal etc on shores of Chargaon and Saiki is causing disturbance. This seem to be one of the big reasons for decline,” says young birder Pushkar Kulkarni.

Bird watcher Narendra Nikhare said increase in fishing activity has led to decline in number of migratory birds since last few years. The BHGs are seen in lesser numbers. “Geese are predominantly vegans and forage on tender chana (gram) shoots but farmers have been cultivating more of cotton and tur. “Change in crop pattern is one of the reasons for decline,” he adds.

Threats To Avians

* Farming on lake beds at Khapri & Chandrabhaga lakes

* Resorts, layouts, edifices coming up close to the lake area at Wadad, Matkazari, Surabardi, Wadgaon (Ranwara), Khapri

* Farm houses near Chandrabhaga

* Fishing, bricks kilns, excavation at Vena

* Telhara lake going to the dogs due to industrial activity

* Farmers switching from soyabean and chana to cotton and tur to get better yields

ddd

Nagpur: In a blatant violation of the Supreme Court orders and later supported by Bombay High Court, the Bhandara deputy collector permitted bullock carts’ race known as ‘shankarpat’ in local parlance in Lakhandur in Bhandara district.

The race was inaugurated in Masal village by none other than assembly speaker and Congress MLA from Sakoli, Nana Patole in the presence of a huge crowd. Repeated attempts to contact Patole proved futile. His videos addressing the gathering and pictures from the site went viral on social media on Sunday.

The apex court in its observations has already said that conducting bullock cart races, which are not anatomically designed, subject animals to pain and suffering. The Bombay High Court, too, supported the view while hearing a PIL filed by Ajay Marathe in 2017.

Despite the Supreme Court ban, Bhandara deputy collector Bodwad issued permission for the race on January 31 under political pressure. The permission was issued when district collector MJ Pradip Chandren and additional collector Vilas Thakre were on leave. Bodwad did not respond to calls.

On January 31, Masal deputy sarpanch Rupesh Govinda Pillewan had applied for permission from the collector’s office on the condition that the organizers will follow all the rules proposed in the Maharashtra Prevention of Cruelty of Animals (conduct of bullock cart race) Rules, 2017.

These rules intended not to cause pain and suffering to animals during the race. However, then Chief Justice Dr Manjulla Chellur & Justice NM Jamdar in their order issued on October 11, 2017, had said, “The rules framed by the state government will not take away observations of the apex court which stated that till the PIL is disposed of on merit, no races should be conducted within the state of Maharashtra and no such permission should be granted by any of the authorities, even after notifying the rules.”

However, the deputy collector seems to be unaware of the PIL in the Bombay High Court and issued permission with certain conditions for the race in a single day. The two-day race was opened by Patole on Sunday.

When Bodwad learnt about the Bombay High Court order, he cancelled the permission on Sunday late afternoon by issuing a letter to the deputy sarpanch. But by the time permission was cancelled, all the arrangements were made and Patole was delivering his inaugural speech. Surprisingly, despite the cancellation letter being issued on February 1, the event took place on February 2.

“We posted a tehsildar to ensure that the event is cancelled,” said a top revenue department official. Till filing of this report it was not confirmed whether the race was called off.

NAGPUR: The hearing for the police custody remand (PCR) of three arrested persons in the Pankaj Giramkar murder case before the judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) extended beyond 11.30pm on Monday. The decision was still to be pronounced while going to the press.

It’s learnt that defence counsel Ritesh Kalra came up with a series of allegations against the police for high-handedness and illegal detention, compelling the court to order a medical examination of the arrested persons — Amarsingh Thakur , Manoj Tiwari and Shubham Dongre — with immediate effect.

The trio, along with Baba Khan, who is on the run, murdered and buried Giramkar and his bike in a 10-feet deep trench in Kapsi on Nagpur-Bhandara Road over an illicit relationship. Pardi police wanted the remand of the trio for a detailed interrogation and also to collect more evidence from the spot.

Advocate Kalra alleged that the three accused were rounded up on January 31 after which a confession was extracted through custodial torture.

Thakur, Tiwari and Dongre were brought back to the court after medical examination following which arguments resumed once again. The prosecution also challenged Kalra’s allegations with their argument that the custodial interrogation was required in the case of the heinous murder.

Maharashta home minister Anil Deshmukh

MUMBAI: Home minister Anil Deshmukh on Sunday set up a two member committee comprising additional chief secretary Shrikant Singh and Joint Commissioner (Intelligence) Amitesh Kumar to probe into allegations of phone tapping of leading politicians, particularly Congress and NCP during the 2019 Lok Sabha and assembly elections.

“Home minister Anil Deshmukh has directed the additional chief secretary (home) Sanjay Kumar to immediately set up the committee comprising Shrikant Singh and Amitesh Kumar. The probe must be completed within six weeks, the committee has been given liberty to induct officers and technical experts as per the requirement,’’ a senior bureaucrat told TOI.

The bureaucrat said ever since Deshmukh took over the reins of the home department, he has been receiving complaints from political parties and prominent leaders regarding misuse of phone tapping by the previous government, which appears to be very serious. “It was brought to the notice of the Home minister that the powers of gathering call data records and phone tapping was grossly misused during the previous government for political gains and vested interest. The abuse of power has serious implications with respect to national security and right to freedom and privacy as enshrined in the constitution of India,’’ he said.

Under such circumstances, the government felt that a comprehensive and broad based probe was essential. “The inquiry should cover not only legal documents, but also take support of technical experts to decipher if unofficial surveillance has been carried out by tracing the foot-print in the servers of various telecom companies through physical verification and visit,’’ the bureaucrat said.

The deceased has been identified as Ravi

NEW DELHI: A 22-year-old man died after inhaling toxic fumes while another person fell unconscious while they were cleaning a sewer line in east Delhi's Karkardooma on Sunday afternoon. The workers were not wearing any protective gear. The contractor of the workers is currently absconding.

Police have registered a case. According to police, a sewer line located in the parking lot of CBD grounds was being cleaned by workers since Saturday.

PM Narendra Modi is likely to address an election rally here on Monday. The deceased has been identified as Ravi and the injured as Sanjay (35).

The contractor, Shanky, had forced five workers to clean the clogged sewer. Since the sewer was 15-feet deep and they did not have any safety gears, the workers had refused to go in, but the contractor forced them to enter it. As per police officials, Ravi entered the sewer first using a rope but inhaled toxic gases. When he did not come out after a few minutes, Sanjay entered the sewer to look for him. When even he did not return, the remaining workers were scared to enter.

Police and the fire department were informed, who then rescued the two and took them to Hedgewar hospital, where Ravi was declared brought dead and Sanjay was referred to Lok Nayak Hospital, where he has been put on a ventilator and his condition is stated to be critical. The sewer line was closed for some days and a private contractor was asked to get it cleaned. Shanky then called Ravi, Sanjay, Monu, Deepak and Rajeev from New Sanjay Amar Colony to clean the sewer. He told them they would get Rs 350 each for the work.

Five of them worked on Saturday as well but the sewer could not be cleaned. The contractor then forced them to go inside and clean it. Around 12.30pm on Sunday, Ravi entered the sewer but fell unconscious inside. Sanjay entered later and he did not return as well. The remaining workers panicked and informed the locals and the police. Fire officials then went inside with oxygen cylinders and rescued the two. None of them had any masks or any safety gear. Shanky later fled after the labourers called police.

Initial probe revealed that Shanky did not pay them for working on Saturday, which is why they worked on Sunday. The deceased resided with his family in D block of New Sanjay Amar Colony. His family was looking for wedding prospects for him.

KALYAN: A 40-year-old Kalyan vegetable vendor and his eight-year-old daughter returning home after a trip to Mumbai to see the RBI headquarters to prepare for a school project, were run over by a train late Saturday.

Arshad Khan and Aisha were hit by an oncoming local after they got down from their train at a signal between Kopar and Kalyan stations as she wanted to answer nature’s call.

“Aisha and her twin brother Arsh, class II students, were to make a project on RBI. So, Arshad took his wife Fatima, 10-year-old son Aimar and the twins to Fort to see the RBI headquarters and also to pick up material for their school project,” Arshad’s brother Mubin Khan said. “Arshad had promised to take them out for dinner, but he never made it home.”

Family, at stn, was waiting for man, daughter

Kalyan GRP sources said when the train stopped at a signal near Patripul bridge, Aisha told her parents she wanted to go to the bathroom. Arshad picked up his daughter and jumped onto the tracks. As the train started, Fatima called up her husband and told him to walk to Kalyan station where they would be waiting for him.

After getting off at Kalyan, Fatima called Arshad on his phone, but he did not take the calls. She panicked and called up her relatives, who, in turn, alerted the Kalyan GRP. The railway police informed them that they had found bodies of a man and a girl on the tracks.

The relatives rushed there and identified the bodies. Preliminary probe suggests that they were hit by an oncoming train, said an officer. “Fatima is worried about her sons’ future as Arshad, who ran a shop in Laxmi Market, was the sole breadwinner,” said Mubin.

""One has to see, whether she will now sit along with BJP members or continue to occupy her seat among AIADMK Rajya Sabha MPs,"" he said. In August 2016, former AIADMK general secretary J Jayalalithaa expelled Sasikala Pushpa from the party saying she had ""brought disrepute"" to the organization. The MP had publicly slapped DMK MP Siva at the Delhi airport. She said Siva had criticized her leader Jayalalithaa. Two days later, however, she declared in the Rajya Sabha that her leader had slapped her and sought protection for herself. ""Sasikala Pushpa should have joined the BJP almost 18 months ago, but the move was held back then. While AIADMK could still issue her a notice, with hardly two months to complete her term, it would matter little in terms of political gains,"" the source added.

But, BJP sees big political gains by inducting her into the party now. ""Sasikala Pushpa, who was a former Mayor of Tuticorin and former secretary of AIADMK women's wing, will strengthen BJP in the southern part of Tamil Nadu,"" said Pon Radhakrishnan, welcoming her into the BJP.

""Sasikala Pushpa is an aggressive and vocal leader from Tamil Nadu, where BJP is gaining strength day by day and several leaders from other parties are joining the party. We have an ideological and political fight with the DMK and Congress in Tamil Nadu. Sasikala Pushpa joining the BJP will strengthen the party and its ability to fight the next assembly elections in Tamil Nadu,"" Rao said. ""Prime Minister Modiji is a global leader and I have been inspired by his leadership, as well as the leadership of Amit Shahji. BJP president Naddaji has given me this opportunity to join the BJP, which is having a great future in Tamil Nadu. In 2021, BJP will come to power in Tamil Nadu and I will work hard for the same,"" Sasikala Pushpa told TOI. ""Schemes for women empowerment, the eradication of fishermen issue, the announcement of Kulasekarapattinam, which comes in my district, to soon become a rocket launch pad and initiatives of Pon Radhakrishanji that resulted in the flow of Rs 28,000 crore worth of investments in southern districts of Tamil Nadu - have all made me join the party,"" she added, while declining to comment on her status as an AIADMK MP.

NEW DELHI: Inspired by a kidnapping they saw on a crime series on television, two 19-year-old youths decided to execute a similar crime to make big money. The youths abducted a two-year-old boy but were nabbed while collecting the ransom.

The boy was abducted on Thursday in west Delhi's Ranhola. He was playing outside his house when the youths lured him with sweets and took him to west Delhi's Hastsal.

Police was alerted by the family after the kidnappers called the child's father, demanding Rs 5 lakh to return the boy. After carrying out negotiations under the supervision of police, the family agreed to pay the ransom. The accused, desperate to get the money, were making too many calls and thus gave away their precise location.

As the youths arrived to collect the money, the cops surrounded them. The child was traced to an open plot nearby. As soon as he was secured, police arrested the kidnappers. ""They were identified as Rahul and Kuldeep, residents of Mohan Garden. The mobile phone and SIM card bought on stolen documents to make the ransom calls were seized."" said A Koan, DCP (outer).

Police said that Rahul is studying BA and Kuldeep is pursuing BCom from a Delhi college. They have been produced before the court and sent to Tihar in judicial custody.

One of the two men who gunned down SSI Wilson

CHENNAI: The murder case of special sub-inspector Y Wilson was transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Saturday, as officials believe that the suspects had a much larger network than expected and there was a need for expertise to apprehend all of them.

So far, police have arrested 22 suspects in the case.

An NIA official confirmed that the case had been transferred to NIA. SSI Wilson was found dead on January 8. Police arrested two prime accused, Abdul Shamim and Thoufique, from Udupi railway station on January 14.

During initial inquiries by police, the duo claimed that they killed Wilson to avenge the arrests of their leader, Khaja Moideen, and aides Syed Abdul Nawas and Abdul Samad in Delhi. The duo said they stabbed Wilson when he was alone at a police checkpost at Kaliyakavilai off Kanyakumari-Thiruvanathapuram bypass road on January 8.

Subsequently, police retrieved the guns and knives used by the duo to kill Wilson from a sewage drain in Kerala. Tamil Nadu police took the two men to Kaliyakavilai checkpost, Ratnagiri and Udupi, where they had stayed in hideouts.

In December last year, officials of the Tamil Nadu 'Q' branch had arrested Pachaiyappan, Rajesh and Liyakath Ali based on their suspicious movements and ""indulging in radical activities"". Police then arrested Mohamed Haneef Khan, 29, Imran Khan, 32, and Mohamed Zaid, 24, from Bengaluru. Subsequently, police arrested Al-Hind Trust coordinator Khaja Moideen, A Syed Ali Nawas, Abdul Samad, from Delhi and Jaffar Ali in Vadodara in Gujarat on January 8.

The phrase, which is a part of Chanakya Niti, a text written as an advice to administrators in the Mauryan empire, found resonance with a crowd that sometimes justified and at other times called for anti-CAA protesters to be shot.Nearly 200-odd men closed in on the protest site around 11.30am. However, police held the fort and they were not allowed inside the main protest area. The men, claiming to be residents of areas like Madanpur Khadar, Sarita Vihar and Jasola, shouted slogans like "" Desh ke gaddaro ko, goli maaro saalo ko.""They were allowed to remain at the site till late afternoon. Towards the evening, police began detaining a few men, loading them into buses, but some managed to force their way out, only to be rounded up again.""The men had gathered here to protest against the closure of the roads and wanted to march towards the protest site. The residents said they were facing trouble because of the road closure and requested police to intervene. Fifty-two people were detained and some were later released,"" said Chinmoy Biswal, DCP (Southeast).The Hindu Sena had called for a protest on Sunday, however, the outfit called off the march in the morning citing ""national interest"". ""The event has been called-off after it was brought to our notice that our earlier press release and video were circulated for the purpose of fear-mongering and to fuel riot-like situation by the anti-India elements organising and supporting the illegal Shaheen Bagh protest ,"" said Hindu Sena national president Vishnu Gupta.The chants of the Jamia shooter, who opened fire at a student on Thursday, were also repeated by several men.

""I am a Hindu and have come to wake up other Hindus. In 1990, our brothers were killed and thrown out from Kashmir. Their houses were captured.

NEW DELHI: In the third shooting incident near a site of anti-CAA protests in the capital in the past four days, two unidentified men on a scooty allegedly opened fire outside gate number 5 of the Jamia Millia Islamia late on Sunday night, according to students who raised an SOS call on several social media platforms around 11.40pm. No injuries were reported.A statement issued by the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), a group comprising students and alumni of the varsity, said the miscreants were on a red scooty. Police sources said they scanned the location but could not find any empty shell there.There were different versions about the vehicles — some saying said it was a motorcycle, others a scooter. “We will conduct an inquiry into the incident and appropriate action will be taken as per law,” said Kumar Gyanesh, additional DCP South East.Soon after the news of the shooting, hundreds of students gathered at the university gate, shouting slogans of Azadi and Inquilab Zindabad. “If they think this will scare us, I just want to say it won’t. We will continue our fight,” said one of the students. Several women from Shaheen Bagh also joined the protest for a night vigil.Another student Prafool, who claimed to be an eyewitness, told TOI that they were managing traffic like every day when two people on a scooty wearing helmets appeared near gate number 5. “We heard a gunshot around 11.40pm. We tried to chase them but they fled on their vehicle and we couldn’t catch them because our way was blocked by an incoming car,” he said.Jamia Nagar SHO reached the protest site soon after to pacify the students. “Give me some time and I will find out who the accused are. We have installed pickets from both sides and will carry out checking throughout the day,” he told protestors.Danish Shaikh, member of JCC, said that several students saw the assailants and “a few of them took their bikes and scooters and chased after them till the Holy Family Hospital. Police assured us that they will take action in two hours but students are unhappy about the lack of security here.”Angry locals assembled at gate number 5 and chased after a police car raising slogans against them.

The men were cooking in a hut when police chanced upon them

CHENNAI: Police arrested eight people on Sunday for hunting wilflife in a forest area close to Tiruvallur . The men are members of the Chennai Rifle Club , Egmore .

Around 2am on Sunday, a patrol team led by special sub-inspector Surendra Kumar heard noises coming from an abandoned hut at Valasai Vetti Kadu near Manavala Nagar in Tiruvallur. When the policemen ventured in, they found eight men busy cooking. They came across a cache of rifles and ammunition inside the hut. During questioning, the men told police that they were members of the rifle club and had been hunting in the area.

Surendra informed the Manavala Nagar police who arrived at the spot and arrested the men. They were identified as K Sunil Karunakaran, 39, of Kancheepuram, D Babu, 51, of Chintadripet, K Ramesh, of Chitlapakkam, K Arul Kumar, 25, of Valasai Vetti Kadu, N Silambarasan, 30, of Ayanavaram, M Boobalan, 31, of Korattur, M Gnanamurthy, 27, of Mambakkam and O P Thangaraj, 35, of Chengalpet.

Police seized four rifles, pellets, flash lights, seven knives and two cars from the men. The men had licences for the guns. Police registered a case under Arms Act for using licensed weapons to hunt animals and birds. An investigation officer said the team seized half-cooked meat from the hut. Preliminary inquiries revealed that the meat may be that of a peacock. Police have handed over the meat to forest department officials for tests. Further investigations are on.

68,['3/02/2020'],New Income Tax Slab 2020: New regime will provide relief to those unable to use tax sops: Revenue secretary,"Revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey (File photo)

The new tax rules have raised several questions. Could you explain how it benefits taxpayers?

So the number of exemptions was a hurdle in simplifying the tax system?

There is a large segment of population in the 30-40 age group, earning around Rs 20 lakh to Rs 40 lakh... this person who has HRA, LTC etc would be worse off...

Could the slabs be increased in a way that a person is not worse? At present, the slab is not attractive enough.

Can more measures to reduce rates be expected?

There is a criticism that there are too many tax slabs.

What about incomes beyond Rs 15 lakh a year?

The expectation is that a no-exemption norm will be adopted totally.

Somehow, efforts to get people who have taxable incomes into the tax net have not met with much success...

There is a view that the state is not giving any support in areas like education or health if all exemptions are given up.

There is a question why long-term capital gain was not touched.

What is the experience with corporation tax cuts?

And the DDT ...

What is the rationale behind increasing the number of days for NRI status?

NEW DELHI: The new tax regime offers an option other than itemised deductions and is in line with tax systems around the world. It may not benefit everyone but allows many unable to claim all exemptions to switch to a better system, revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey tells Sidhartha , Surojit Gupta and Rajeev Deshpande . Excerpts:Companies give you consolidated salaries, asking you to choose how your salary should be distributed. A lot of people in this segment are likely to gain. Then, a businessman with a turnover of around Rs 2 crore does not have HRA or LTC or various other exemptions. On a turnover of Rs 2 crore, his taxable income is Rs 16 lakh (at a rate of 8%, which will be subject to income tax). He can’t claim all exemptions. In contrast, there might be someone who claims Rs 4.5 lakh exemptions. But there are not many people like that. Many may take only a Rs 1.5 lakh exemption. Many in the 55-60 age bracket, who own a house and do not pay a loan any more, do not get HRA and may not want to contribute to NPS. They will be gainers in the new system. The idea is that in this exemption-riddled regime there were lot of people without requisite savings to save tax, they were at a disadvantage.Read also: 'If Kuber wants to give, then you must keep doors open'The primary purpose of this exercise is to move to a simplified tax regime. And to provide some relief to people who, because of their financial situation, are not able to access all kinds of exemptions.That is correct. Such a person will stay in the old regime.There can be a situation where you make it attractive but you need to see how much revenue the government can forego. This exercise alone is going to cost Rs 40,000 crore. Ideally, we should bring down the tax rate to a level that everyone is benefited. Given fiscal constraints, this is not possible.It depends on the response and how much tax we should be collecting. What should be our tax to GDP ratio? There is also a view that exemptions should not exceed a certain ratio to income. In the old regime, it is inequitous for those who cannot take the exemptions.The number of tax slabs is a progressive model. If you have lesser or gradual tax, you do not feel the pinch. Earlier, there was 5%, 20% and 30%. Most countries in the world, China, Thailand , Malaysia , Philippines , US, Australia, have six-seven slabs. When people are moving from one tax slab to another, they should not get a shock. If the jumps are steep, there would be a tendency to under report income.Beyond Rs 15 lakh, the rates are the same but they benefit too. They pay tax on lower rate on income which is less than Rs 15 lakh.There are systems elsewhere where you take a flat deduction or take itemised deductions. There are alternatives in most countries. The situation here was we were only itemising deductions but there was no flat rate option. In a country of 130 crore people, there are only around 1.5 crore people who are actually paying taxes. Out of that, one has find how many will find it beneficial to switch to the new regime. People may have a choice from the two options which are available. A person may have some constraints that prevent him from taking exemptions. We feel this is a significant section. Could we have reduced rates even more? We have to keep the fiscal space in mind.We know this, data is being collected on property purchases, someone making gains in equity market, an expensive lifestyle, a mismatch between income declared and GST.No, state support is there for so many services. In fact, many receive services without paying any tax at all.The fundamental principle of taxation from the fairness, equity point of view, is that every element of income be taxed. If a salary is being taxed, as is business income, then why should capital gain, another form of income, not be taxed. If someone has sold a property, it is an income and should be taxed. If someone has got gains from stock market, it is also an income. The risk in stock market is no different than that in an MSME. It was introduced in 2018, and people say don’t keep changing rules. It leads to distorting the tax structure, suppose stocks are offered as part of income? Remember, investments in stocks and MFs happen on basis of solid assessments of the economy and policy environment. Our policy for a country of 130 crore cannot have a tax structure like a tax haven.It seems more than 90% will opt for the lower tax.Please see, the taxation earlier was almost 25%. The rate on debt funds was around 30%. Even someone with income less than 5 lakh would be taxed at 20-25%. Someone with higher incomes was also paying at the same rate. Then, people at lower incomes were virtually subsidising the rich. The demand of industry was to go to the classical tax system, and that is what has been done. A majority of people with lesser incomes will pay a lower dividend tax. Foreign investors will gain, dividend will be taxed in the hands of recipients and they will get credit at home.It is not a question of number of individuals, it is a matter of principle. This is an anti-abuse provision. It will not affect a person who is working in the Gulf, for example.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73885454,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1544474,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-regime-will-provide-relief-to-those-unable-to-use-tax-sops-revenue-secretary/articleshow/73885174.cms

KOLKATA: The city police is planning tidal movement of traffic along the Chitpore Lockgate flyover to serve the peakhour Tallah traffic if the oneway (north-bound) plan fails on Monday.On Sunday, only north-bound traffic was allowed on the flyover.Since majority of commuters (office- or school-bound) travels from north (Sinthee) to south (Shyambazar and further south to Dalhousie) during the morning peaks hours, the plan is to turn traffic on Chitpore flyover from north to south from 6am to 1pm and from south to north between 1pm and 10pm to serve the home-bound traffic.Police officers on Monday will also meet the engineers of Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), the custodian of Lockgate flyover, to gauge whether both-way traffic can be run along the two-lane flyover. Traffic police said that buses are now using the 1.2km flyover connecting Bagbazar in south and Chiria More in north.Traffic police officers said there was heavy rush of southbound traffic along the Chiria More-Dum Dum Road-Northern Avenue-Belgachhia Road-R G Kar Road even on Sunday. Till noon, the route was chock-a-block on the first day after the closure of Tallah Bridge. A good number of commuters was moving along Tallah Bridge in light vehicles and autos.If there is complete collapse of traffic on Monday, we have to think of Plan B and Plan C.Meanwhile, keeping in mind the chaos after the collapse of Majerhat bridge, Kolkata Police is deploying a huge force in the area. The joint commissioner, traffic, Santosh Pandey, and deputy commissioner, Rupesh Kumar, will be monitoring the overall management. Fifteen traffic sergeants have been brought in from various other departments. Seventy additional police personnel and four inspectors, with prior knowledge of managing traffic in this region, will also be posted.Besides, 100 additional police personnel will be deployed to look after law and order situation. Kolkata Police has already notified to do away with on-road parking all along the alternative routes.

NEW DELHI: The government is likely to retain the sovereign guarantee to Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) and protect interests of policyholders as it seeks to list the insurance behemoth with the aim of improving disclosures, unlocking massive value and sharing wealth with investors, a top official said.Department of investment and public asset management secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey told TOI that fears of policyholders being adversely impacted were unfounded. “The regulator (IRDA) is there. It’s a very important company and everything will be taken care of. While the issue has been discussed for long, a political call has been taken this time,” he said.Finance secretary Rajeev Kumar said the Centre intends to retain the sovereign guarantee for LIC, while also leaving the transfer of surplus to policyholder funds for dividends, unchanged at 5%, instead of 10% for other insurance companies. The government will soon move a bill to amend the LIC Act, seeking to allow a public issue of shares, which could be in the range of 5-10%.Pandey said the FM would analyse data linked to LIC and then prepare a roadmap for the listing. He said LIC was a very large institution and any IPO would be of a big size but did not elaborate on its likely proportions. He also did not give a timeline for the listing but other officials said it could take up to a year for the process to go through.The DIPAM secretary said the department’s focus would be on stepping up strategic sales in the next fiscal year. On Air India, he said, “What we want is an airline which will actually grow. Our intention is to have the flag of AI high.” However, he added that the airline business needed nimble managements and several efforts to revive AI had failed.“They are in different stages but in BPCL we are fairly at an advanced stage of coming with an expression of interest. There will be a global invitation of interest soon. We really hope that in the first half of next year, we will conclude many transactions,” Pandey said when asked about the status of strategic stake sale in oil major BPCL, logistics firm Concor, Shipping Corporation of India and national carrier Air India.Pandey said the government had done a fair job in terms of the principle for allocation of debt in sale of AI. “Debt was one of the big issues due to accumulated losses of many years. Any investor who would pick it up has to be sustainable,” he said. Pandey said the airline business was nimble. “It’s no longer that you have a fat margin. It’s no longer a Maharaja business. It’s a business where you have to work hard. Wherever you can save.

KOLKATA: A four-year-old speech-impaired girl, who had come to Kolkata book fair in Salt Lake with her parents and gone missing on Saturday evening, was tracked down by the cops in half an hour after they shared the missing child's photograph on a cop WhatsApp group. The officers posted at the ground looked for the kid in a ""white sweater and pink bunny woollen cap"".

Parents of the child - Shreesha Dey - had come running to the office of Publishers and Booksellers Guild around 6.30pm frantically as they sought help from the officials, saying their only child had gone missing.

The parents said they were flipping through some books at a stall when they suddenly realised that their daughter was not by their side and immediately raised an alarm.

""The parents had looked around the nearby book stalls and after failing to locate their child, they approached the authorities for help. The mother was crying and didn't know what to do. We immediately began announcing about the missing child with her description and asked anyone who could spot her to bring her to our office. We also asked the cops to start a search opeartion,"" said a senior official of the guild.

As the parents, residents of Rajarhat, approached the cops, they asked the couple to calm down and asked for a photograph of the child. The parents shared a photograph of the child on WhatsApp to the officer-in-charge of the control room at the book fair and he immediately shared the photograph on a WhatsApp group that had all police personnel posted at the book fair as members.

""Within moments, all policemen at the book fair had the photograph and details of the girl. Everyone was asked to start searching for the girl on a priority basis and within 35 minutes we were able to track down the child, who was standing at a corner, sobbing. She looked jittery among the crowd near the food stalls,"" said an official of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.

A constable, who had spotted the girl, reported the senior officers that she looked somewhat different from the one in the photograph but was not speaking a word. He took a photograph of the child and shared it on the group. When the parents were shown the photograph, they identified the child, following which the constable brought her to the police control room and handed her over to her parents.

NEW DELHI: The government is looking at mandatory enrolment of workers in the pension scheme when they join the organised sector workforce, while giving them the flexibility to decide their contribution , as part of fresh efforts to provide a robust social security net for millions of workers, a top government official said.“There will be a system of auto enrolment and an employee can contribute Rs 100 while the employer can also contribute. People who are young today need to save for tomorrow,” finance secretary Rajeev Kumar said. In the Union Budget , the government has announced the plan, which will provide for inter-operability of schemes and provide safeguards for the accumulated corpus.Currently, pension plans are sold by insurance companies, mutual funds as well as companies that operate under the National Pension System regulated by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority of India. In addition, the Employees Provident Fund Organisation provides Employees Pension Scheme by transferring a part of the employee’s and employer’s contribution in addition to the Employees State Insurance Corporation .The finance secretary said that the idea was to bring them all under one umbrella so that subscribers did not lose their money in case they switched jobs. Besides, the government views pension sector as a potential source of large fund flow that will also encourage long-term investors to pump money into infrastructure and other sectors.The pension regulatory agency was set up over a decade ago to implement the NPS and provide low cost solutions for retirement savings. But despite tax benefits, the scheme has not taken off although the kitty has expanded to around Rs 4.2 lakh crore.Kumar said the government has taken a series of steps in the Budget to ensure that the cost of financial intermediation comes down through measures such as the proposed bill for netting of financial transactions.There are several steps to enhance liquidity in the system by introducing new tools and strengthening the existing ones.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73893973,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-88825,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pension-scheme-may-see-mandatory-enrolments/articleshow/73885583.cms

MUMBAI: The BMC is expected to spend more on big-ticket infrastructure projects, including the Rs 12,000-crore Mumbai Coastal Road and the Rs 4,700-crore Goregaon-Mulund Link Road (GMLR), compared to last year. Missing road links, including the elevated road from Cuffe Parade to Nariman Point, may also receive sizeable allocation with CM Uddhav Thackeray recently having stressed on the need for the same to reduce traffic congestion. Municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi will present his first budget on Tuesday.With no rise in income from revenue sources like property tax, no large increase in the budget size can be expected the upcoming financial year.The Rs 30,692-crore BMC budget 2019-20 had made a provision of Rs 1,600 crore for the coastal road project, which had started in December 2018. The 9.98km coastal road will link Marine Drive to the south-end of Bandra-Worli Sea Link. Also, with significant works on GMLR expected to start from this year, a large allocation may be made for the 12.2km eastwest connector. Sources said missing road links, like the Cuffe Parade-Nariman Point elevated road, may also receive an allocation, along with two road over-bridges at Mahalaxmi worth Rs 745 crore—one will connect Dr E Moses Road to Jacob Circle, while a cablestayed bridge will be between Mahalaxmi Racecourse and Jacob Circle. The elevated road and the ROBs will help motorists connect to the proposed coastal road.BMC Budget 2020-21 is also likely to emphasize on involving corporates in improving the city’s aesthetics and cleanliness quotient. A pilot project was recently carried out in GSouth ward, which covers Worli, Mahalaxmi and Lower Parel. The BMC had roped in a corporate to hire manpower and machinery to keep roads and footpaths clean as as part of the latter’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme The revision of the open spaces policy, which is already under way, is likely to proposed in the budget giving recreational and public grounds to private entities for maintenance for a specified period. Bandra corporator Asif Zakeria warned that the BMC would need to keep ‘errant’ private entities at bay. The budget may also emphasise on promoting tourist-friendly destinations developed by the BMC, including Byculla zoo, Pramod Nawalkar Viewing Gallery located next to Kamala Nehru Park at Malabar Hill and Matoshri Meenatai Thackeray Shilpgram at Jogeshwari.Corporators suggested that the budget should propose innovative ways to hike revenue without burdening taxpayers. “The last two budgets have been dipping into BMC’s Rs 70,000-crore fixed deposits. It is not a positive sign as FDs should ideally be put to use on during a contingency,” pointed out NCP party leader and Ghatkopar corporator Rakhi Jadhav. Opposition party leader in the BMC, Ravi Raja from Congress, said ‘realistic budget should be priority’. “Big-ticket infrastructure works should be completed in a time-bound manner,” he added. Samajwadi Party corporator Rais Shaikh said: “There’s a need to provide better footpaths and implement garbage segregation. Involvement of corporates at a certain level may be a good idea ...a CSR cell can be set up in the civic body.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73885579,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-207072,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-may-not-increase-budget-size-but-spend-more-on-infrastructure/articleshow/73885578.cms

Despite being a boy-meets-girl tale, the way she pulled it off is amazing,” says Raj, adding, “The best part with a woman helming the show is, you get to see a female perspective. My belief in her talent is so immense that I launched my son with her.”The film is a coming-of-age tale of Siddu played by Shiva. But it also has strong female characters — his mother played by Pavitra Lokesh, who is the breadwinner, his college crush Aishwarya (Malavika) and his other love interest, Shruti ( Varsha Bollamma), both independent women aware of what they want in a relationship. “The women in my film aren’t the typical glam-dolls who breeze in and out of the hero’s life,” says Sindhu about her characters. “The effort was to show that they are flawed in their own ways. When love stories are narrated, they’re usually told from the perspective of a man; Choosi Choodangaane differs in that aspect,” she adds.The film also benefits from the huge number of women technicians, says Raj. “I believe the film industry should have more female technicians. My previous film Mental Madhilo had Manisha Satyavolu as the art director and this film sees Shanti Rao as the production designer and Padmavati Vishweshwar as the dialogue writer. More women behind the screen mean more balanced stories onscreen,” he says adding, “Women in my films are always strong and provide a certain balance to the guy.” Sindhu adds, “I’m glad the audience liked the film because the response has been great.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73890672,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-133667/73890672.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/telugu/movies/choosi-choodangaane-a-love-story-told-from-a-womans-perspective/articleshow/73890672.cms

NEW DELHI: Several states, including Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal, have shown interest in setting up greenfield smart cities along industrial corridors and the Centre will decide on the location through a challenge method, a senior government officer said.

“We will go for a challenge to decide the states that will get the projects,” Guruprasad Mohapatra , secretary for industrial promotion and internal trade, said. In the Budget, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the setting up of five new smart cities in PPP mode. Already, new cities in Dadri (UP), Dholera (Gujarat), Shendra Bidkin (Maharashtra) and Vikram Udyogpuri (Madhya Pradesh) are coming up along the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor.

A similar model will be followed along new industrial corridors such as Delhi-Kolkata, Kolkata-Chennai, Mumbai-Bengaluru and Chennai-Bengaluru, where the state will provide land and the Centre will provide equity to a special purpose vehicle. The SPV will raise resources to create infrastructure and plug-and-play facility. The state will provide infrastructure such as water and power supply.

States that provide land first and sign a state support scheme to back the development are expected to be preferred, sources said.

80,['3/02/2020'],Coronavirus transmission by ‘silent carriers’ a worry,"Representative image

KOLKATA: It was not enough to quarantine only those with suspected symptoms of the novel coronavirus since many could be ‘silent carriers’ — like the nurse from Wuhan, who had flown back to Kochi via Kolkata on January 23 — and their symptoms may show up later when they have already come in contact with others in the community and transmitted the disease, warned experts.Even though the Indians, who landed in Delhi on Thursday night, will remain in isolation for 15 days, several may have already reached Kolkata from the affected countries. While one was suspected to have symptoms of the virus and was later released, the clinical report of a Thai national, who died at a private hospital last week, was negative.It is important to study the history of a visitor’s travel and take steps accordingly, said virologists. If he or she has been to China or any other part of the continent, where there were chances of coming in contact with infected people, vigilance is a must, felt experts. “This strain of coronavirus spreads very fast unlike other common viruses. Other strains of coronavirus cause common cough and cold and the influenza viruses. It may take several days for the symptoms to manifest so the people, who have travelled through the affected regions, need to be screened for at least a fortnight. Or else, they may end up transmitting the disease,” said virologist Amitabha Nandy.He added that a silent carrier increases more the chances of transmission and it could be difficult to control the spread of the virus, if one or two such carriers manage to sneak into the city. “Since the early signs of novel coronavirus aren’t different from other common viruses, it is difficult to detect it at the first stage. So, screening and isolation are a must,” said Nandy.The virus may take up to 14 days to manifest itself through symptoms, said Fortis Hospital internal medicine consultant Joydeep Ghosh. “The majority of the infected people could remain without the symptoms for more than a week. But they are carrying the virus and pose a bigger threat since they are not being suspected and others come in contact with them. A fortnight’s screening is the only real full-proof measure to prevent the transmission,” said Ghosh.It is, however, too early to assume that the virus is more lethal than other common viruses, said doctors. In fact, SARS that is also a coronavirus had a 10% mortality rate while novel so far has a mortality rate of less than 3%. “But these are still early days and we don’t know the real numbers yet. But going by the reports so far, it is highly contagious and difficult to contain,” said Biswas.Severe breathing distress in young healthy people, diarrhoea with fever, cough and cold may indicate novel coronavirus, said AMRI Hospitals consultant Debashish Saha. “If a healthy person shows severe viral symptoms, there is a reason to be concerned. Since there is no medicine for coronavirus, it is better to get admitted to hospital. This will ensure isolation,” said Saha.Any fast-spreading virus is bound to lead to deaths, pointed out Nandy. “Initially, people are not aware of this fact and tend to ignore the symptoms that lead to a delayed intervention and death. Those, especially elderly people suffering from low immunity, cardiac ailments, renal or kidney ailments, lung diseases are more vulnerable,” said Nandy.Novel coronavirus could be fatal for the elderly with respiratory diseases since it affects the lungs and causes breathing distress. “It may lead to pneumonia that can be fatal,” said Nandy. But there are no early sings to distinguish it from other viruses, he added.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73885645,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-164048,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-coronavirus-transmission-by-silent-carriers-a-worry/articleshow/73885683.cms

HYDERABAD: Delays in issuance of smart cards to issue vehicle registration certificates has thrown the entire vehicle registration process of applicants into disarray yet again.

Each RTA office in Hyderabad and Rangareddy district is equipped to print more than 300 cards a day and these are sent to vehicle owners within 7 days by Speed Post.

However, the applicants are now being forced to wait for months due to the delay.

""It has been nearly a month since I got my vehicle registered at Trimulgherry Road Transport Authority (RTA) office and yet I did not receive the smart card which the officials are supposed to send to my mailing address. I do not understand why there is a delay when we are paying the fee for smart cards and postal fee during the registration,"" said G Sainath, a resident of Trimulgherry.

When Sainath went back to the RTA office recently to check the status of his smart card, he said, ""Some brokers waiting outside the office said I could get the card on the same day if I paid additional money. The brokers at the RTA office are cashing in on the delsay. I think it is time they find a permanent solution to this problem.""

Another applicant, Mohammad Imraan asked, ""My application for registration of my new car was approved in the first week of January, but I am yet to get the smart card. Why do they collect money from us for the card if they are not able to dispatch it on time?""

The problem was addressed in July last year after the transport minister reviewed the situation and asked the district officers to arrange for the consumables of printing cards and printers within three days and clear the pending cases within 15 days.

However, the solution to clear the pending cases last year turned out to be a temporary one.

""Earlier, the printing machines were not working and now there is a delay because the contractors who supply the raw material to print these cards are not being paid on time. A committee should be formed to find a permanent solution to this problem,"" said M Dayananad, general secretary of Telangana Auto and Motor Vehicle union.

When contacted, C Ramesh, joint transport commissioner (IT), RTA said, ""We are working on the issue and the problem will be resolved soon. As of now, we are asking people to download the documents on the mobile application.""

We all know what happened in Gorakhpur”.Hitting out at Union home minister Amit Shah, he said: “Our students are doing so well and Shahji is saying that they are not able to read properly. He is insulting the students...The parties that had nothing to do with the city earlier are also contesting the elections, just so that they could somehow defeat us. That’s their only motive,” he said.

The Nehru Zoological Park, which is spread across 380 acres, houses 173 species and nearly 1,800 specimens

HYDERABAD: As part of the animal exchange programme with Chennai’s Vandalur Zoo , the Nehru Zoological Park in Hyderabad will soon have some new inmates, including a pair of swamp deer and one female lion tailed macaque by the end of this month.

The zoo is going to procure these animals as part of an exchange for a one-horned rhinoceros that was sent to Vandalur zoo in August last year. “The pair of swamp deer and the lion-tailed macaque are expected to arrive by the end of this month. We have one male lion-tailed macaque now and with the arrival of a female lion-tailed macaque, we will have a pair,” said zoo curator, N Kshitija.

The paperwork to procure four grey kangaroos and one pair of meerkats in exchange for one pair of Asiatic lions is also in progress. According to the zoo officials, the kangaroos and meerkats are part of the animal exchange programme with the Yokohoma Zoological Garden in Japan.

“The animals from Japan are expected to arrive in two or three months. We gave a female Asiatic lion to the Yokohoma zoo for which they are giving us two pairs of kangaroos and one pair of meerkats. We will have these animals in the zoo for the first time,” an official said.

The zoo authorities have referred the proposal to the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) and are waiting for the permissions from Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Central Zoo Authority to bring the animals to the city zoo.

The Nehru Zoological Park, which is spread across 380 acres, houses 173 species and nearly 1,800 specimens.

Train to KIA by 2022

Services from 5am

BENGALURU: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday said work on Bengaluru’s suburban rail project will be taken up on priority and be completed within three years, a move that is certain to ease commute across the city, especially to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA).Addressing a press conference with Union minister of state for railways Suresh Angadi alongside him, Yediyurappa said: “It is a longpending project and a dream of former Union minister [and late BJP leader] HN Ananth Kumar. The Union government announced implementation of the project in the budget. The project will be completed in three years.”That timeframe would be an astonishing feat in a city where infrastructure projects have been horribly delayed. However, it was at odds with the deadline set by Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE), the SPV (special purpose vehicle) set up to execute the project. While unveiling a detailed plan on the four-corridor 148km project on Sunday, K-RIDE said it will take six years to complete.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the project at a cost of Rs 18,600 crore in the Union budget on Saturday, but it is yet to be approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA). However, Angadi and Bengaluru Central MP PC Mohan said CCEA approval will be granted soon, while the central government will also extend funding.Meanwhile, K-RIDE said the suburban rail project will comprise four corridors: KSR Bengaluru City-Devanahalli, Byappanahalli-Chikkabanavara, Kengeri-Cantonment-Whitefield and Heelalige-Rajanukunte.In a huge boost to air passengers, the KSR Bengaluru City-Yelahanka- KIA- Devanahalli (41.4km) line is likely to be operational by August 2022. K-RIDE said work will be taken up on priority and the line will have 14 stations. It will be built at an estimated cost of Rs 5,127 crore. In contrast, the Rs 10,584 crore Silk Board-KR Puram (ORR)-KIA Namma Metro corridor project is yet to get approval from the Centre and is scheduled to open only in 2024.Moreover, suburban rail could provide cheaper and quicker connectivity to KIA than the Metro since airport passengers from the central business district and south Bengaluru opting for the Metro will have to change several trains to get to KIA.K-RIDE said of the 148km track, 59.4km will be elevated and 92.59km will be at grade. Similarly, of the 57 suburban stations, 21 will be elevated. All four corridors will be operational in six years and is expected to have a daily ridership of 10 lakh passengers. K-RIDE will have autonomy in deciding fares.All suburban trains will have air-conditioned coaches. Services will begin from 5am and continue till midnight. Stations at many locations will interface with Indian Railways and Namma Metro ones. This is expected to facilitate development of a multimodal transport system for Bengaluru.K-RIDE revealed 583 acres is required for the project, including railway land (327 acres), Karnataka government (153 acres) and private land for corridors and depots (103 acres). While railway land and Karnataka government land is proposed to be leased at a nominal cost of Rs 1 per acre, cost of private land will be borne by the state government.According to K-RIDE, the project will be revenue positive from the first year itself. Total revenue per year is projected at Rs 1,378 crore, while operational and maintenance cost has been estimated at Rs 614 crore a year.Yediyurappa said once completed, the project will reduce traffic congestion, promote faster connectivity and also reduce environmental pollution.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73885905,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-415661,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/suburban-rail-in-3-years-says-cm-bs-yediyurappa-6-says-k-ride/articleshow/73885829.cms

SECUNDERABAD: With residents of Uppal complaining that fogging machines just zip past their area, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials took note of the exact locations and added them to their pin-point programme.As a part of the programme, anti-larval operations are carried out in a locality every eight days. The newly-appointed zonal commissioner also promised bio-remediation and antilarval operations with the help of drones. The drones would be pressed into service especially around lakes and places where human cannot reach physically.Replying to a question by a resident, GHMC zonal commissioner, LB Nagar, and additional commissioner, information technology wing, Sikta Patnaik said, “Fogging for a longer duration or staff equipped with fogging machines plying too slow can result in accidents. Fogging has to be done scientifically.”She also explained the measures being taken by the entomology wing through drone and pin-point programme. GHMC entomology department officials emphasised that fumigation, in terms of fogging, was not the solution to reduce vector-borne diseases. Fogging would be done only on streets away from houses following the World Health Organization (WHO) rules, they added.As per norms, if an employee carries a portable fogging machine (used in bylanes) on a bike, the speed limit should be between five km and 10 km. The vehicle-mounted machines ply on main roads and they ply fast compared to portable machines. “Number of vehicle-mounted fogging machines has been scaled up across Greater Hyderabad,” the IAS officer said.Coordination with sanitation, engineering and entomology department by removing garbage points, identification of hot spots by taking epidemiological data between 2017 and 2020 were the other activities GHMC was taking up in LB Nagar as well as in rest of the city, according to entomology wing officers. “GHMC is also using eportal information to track dengue cases and take measures accordingly,” they added.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73885895,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110849,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-to-deploy-drones-for-anti-larval-operations/articleshow/73885920.cms

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

HYDERABAD: In the Samatha gangrape and murder case, a fast-track court in Adilabad awarded capital punishment to three convicts last week after a record trial in less than 70 days, but relied heavily on the Supreme Court’s verdict in the Nirbhaya case.The judge hoped the soul of Samatha may rest in peace with the grant of capital punishment.In her 66-page order in the Samatha case, principal sessions judge MG Priyadarshini agreed with the prosecution, who quoted the apex court judgement in the Nirbhaya and other cases, while awarding death penalty to accused Shaik Babu, Shaik Shabuddin and Shaik Maqdoom.On the critical aspect of whether the fast-track court should grant death penalty or not to the trio, the judge referred and quoted the apex court judgement from the Nibhaya case.“Two questions are to be asked and answered: i) Is there something uncommon about the crimes which regard sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate. ii) Whether there is no alternative punishment suitable except death sentence. Where a crime is committed with extreme brutality and the collective conscience of society is shocked, courts must award death penalty, irrespective of their personal opinion as regards desirability of death penalty. By not imposing a death sentence in such cases, the courts may do injustice to the society at large,”.In her reasoning, the judge said, “Considering all the facts and circumstances and the ghastly nature of the offence and the heinous attitude of the accused in commission of the offence, this court feels that if a capital punishment of death is imposed against the accused 1 to 3 in this case, not only the ends of justice would meet, but at the same time the soul of deceased (Samatha) may also rest in peace. Therefore, the crime committed by the accused satisfied the test of rarest of rare cases. As such, this court feels that the accused (1 to 3) do not deserve any mercy’’.On the aspect of matching DNA profiles too, the prosecution relied on the Nibhaya case, where in the apex court said: “The matching of DNA profile from the material objects recovered from the deceased and the accused is sufficient to connect with the offence. The above findings squarely apply to the case on hand (Samatha case) as in the present case also the evidence of a witness establishes that the DNA profiles of the accused are matched with that of the DNA samples collected from the saree of the deceased (Samatha). Thus, the matching of DNA profiles of accused with that of the DNA profiles found on the saree of deceased not only strengthens the above circumstances established from the evidence, but also establishes that it is the accused, who committed rape on the deceased’’.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73886034,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-484064,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/samatha-gangrape-nirbhaya-verdict-sealed-fate-of-accused/articleshow/73886081.cms

Gold worth Rs 13.3 crore was seized

VIJAYAWADA: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) seized 31.5 kg gold worth 13.3 crore in the last three days.

DRI caught three consignments in Vijayawada and one at Secunderabad railway station and arrested 13 people for transporting smuggled gold. DRI units of Nellore, Vijayawada and Hyderabad conducted a coordinated operation based on specific intelligence.

On January 31, DRI Nellore unit intercepted three passengers travelling from Chennai to Warangal in Jaipur SF Express train. They were carrying 7.228 kg of gold bars in bags. They told DRI that they carried cash from Warangal to Chennai and purchased smuggled gold of foreign origin and going to handover the gold to the mastermind in Warangal.

On February 1, DRI officers from Vijayawada intercepted three persons on board of GT Express at Vijayawada railway station. They purchased smuggled gold of foreign origin weighing about 7.077 kg and were going to Warangal to handover the gold to the mastermind.

On the same day, DRI Vijayawada and Hyderabad units intercepted a bus heading for Warangal from Guntur at Vijayawada. Four passengers were held with 6.47 kg of gold concealed in their clothes. They took the train from Chennai to Warangal but got off at Kavali in Nellore.

They took a bus to Ongole and from there to Guntur and to Warangal. All the three gangs were heading to Warangal and it was not clear whether they belonged to the same gang and the mastermind behind the smuggling racket is one person or multiple persons involved.

The fourth incident happened on Sunday at Secunderabad railway station where DRI intercepted three persons in Chennai-Hyderabad Superfast Express. DRI recovered 10.7 kg of gold bars concealed in their clothes. DRI booked cases under the Customs Act and investigation is on to trace the masterminds.

KOLKATA: Both organizers and the police have taken steps to strengthen security and increase vigil at the anti-CAA sit-in sites in the city after two incidents of firing at Jamia Milia and Shaheen Bagh in less than three days. Thousands throng these venues in some of the busiest areas of Kolkata to show solidarity with the protesters who have been demonstrating for weeks and it becomes difficult for the cops and organizers to scan everybody. But after the two incidents in the Capital, efforts are on to keep an eye out for trouble.Police have deployed more personnel inside and outside Park Circus Maidan where women have been sitting in protest for more than three weeks. At Nawab Ali Park in Ekbalpore , the organizers have increased the number of volunteers and on Zakaria Street, everybody has been told to be alert and immediately inform organizers and cops if they notice anything suspicious.“The two lone-wolf attacks in the Capital are like the worst nightmares coming true. There are elements who want to give the entire movement a communal colour and portray it as violent. There have been several peaceful protests in Kolkata. We are alert and careful so that the protests remain peaceful,” said Arshad Parvez Khan, one of the organizers of the sit-in at Nawab Ali Park. The number of volunteers has been increased and cops have been requested to keep a vigil. “We have also applied for permission to install CCTV cameras around the venue,” he said.At Park Circus Maidan, the organizers have started noting down details of all those who are coming up to address the protesters. Details are also being taken of people arriving in big groups to join the protests. The organizers have increased the number of volunteers who often make a human chain when the crowd swells. Anyone found loitering is being requested to either join the protest or leave the spot.“We are determined to keep the protests peaceful. So we are regularly co-ordinating with the cops. We are also keeping a watch on whoever is coming to join us. We are taking down the details of every person who is coming up to address the gathering. We have more than 100 volunteers working in shifts,” said a core-committee member of the organizing team.On Zakaria Street, too, the protest organizers have requested cops to increase security.

The move is introduced to increase the participation of the age group. (File photo)

NASHIK: The Commission (EC) of India has decided to extend the "" postal ballot for absentee voters "" facility to the voters aged 80 years or more as well as people with disabilities.

According to senior officials of district administration, the Chief Election Officer of Maharashtra has issued a letter asking the district election office to provide ""postal ballots "" to voters who are 80 years old (or more) and even to PWDs who have their names in the electoral rolls for the upcoming elections.

The ECI has decided to provide this relief to the voters who find it difficult to travel to election booths based on the feedback it has received.

""Whether it is citizens aged 80 years or PWDs - both usually depend on family members or others to take them to election booths. This is the biggest reason why these citizens often do not cast their votes,"" the officer said.

To increase their participation in the electoral process, the EC has decided to include them in the list of ""absentee voters"". The list already includes servicemen - who are posted away from their native place - and their immediate relatives.

""Since it is not feasible for them to travel, the government prints postal ballots for them and sends the same to the voters through email. They are asked to mark their votes secretly and send the same to the election officer within the stipulated time,"" the officer added.

A similar exercise will be carried out for the citizens aged 80 or more and PWDs who will get the postal ballots at their homes.

The CEO has also asked the district election officers to identify such voters in their district electors' roll and flag them.

""The district election officers will, through the booth level officers (BLOs), prepare the list of all citizens who meet the criteria and at the time of elections, postal ballots will be sent to them,"" the officer said.

Specialists not available

AHMEDABAD: Rural Gujarat pays the least, after Tamil Nadu, for treatment at public hospitals, according to a Union government report ‘Key Indicators of Social Consumption in India: Health’. The report, however, says these rural folk place more faith in small private clinics or private hospitals than in public health facilities.Rural Gujarat pays an average of Rs 1,191 for treatment at public hospitals while their urban counterparts shell out Rs 3,529 on average. However, in rural Gujarat, only one in three persons prefers government hospitals to private clinics or hospitals. In urban Gujarat, only one in five persons prefers government facilities for treatment.The report states that in rural areas the average spending at a private hospital is Rs 25,027, which is 17% lower than at a private hospital in urban Gujarat.A senior state government health official said that even with treatment costs higher at private hospitals, in both rural and urban areas people prefer private medical help to government hospitals. “The reasons for these are the lack of facilities and unavailability of senior doctors at government hospitals.”“The problem with such urban-rural surveys is that they do not capture the fact that specialized surgeries such as heart, kidney, or obstetrics don’t take place in rural areas. For that one goes to cities or district referral hospitals, where medical costs will be higher. At public referral hospitals too, patient care costs are higher as they include food, travel, loss of daily earning, among other costs,” said Dileep Mavalankar, director of the Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH), Gandhinagar.In fact, at many taluka-level hospitals in Gujarat, specialists are not available. These positions are gradually being filled. Also, just 60% of the funds that Gujarat gets from the Centre under the National Health Mission is utilized. Thus, with fewer facilities and with specialist appointments taking time, people end up paying more at private hospitals in urban areas, Dileep Mavalankar, director of the Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH), Gandhinagar said.Mavalankar added, “Although there are a number of health subsidies, I feel there is ample scope in Gujarat to take these benefits to those in need with better health management, planning and provisioning for a special unplanned fund to handle events such as epidemics, episodes of which will only get more frequent.”Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary, health, said, “Paying less than in other states in the country is a good sign. We are working on plans to further reduce the burden of healthcare costs on common people. We have observed that treatment often pushes people into debt.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73886286,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-140654,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/healthcare-in-rural-gujarat-second-cheapest-in-india/articleshow/73886041.cms

AHMEDABAD: With change in wind direction, the city experienced a rise in minimum temperature but strong winds forced citizens to wear warmer clothes on Sunday. Mild dust devils were observed in several parts of the city in the morning and afternoon.

According to India Meteorological Department (IMD) website, Ahmedabad on Sunday recorded 26.8 C maximum and 13.2 C minimum temperature in the 24 hours ending at 5pm. The maximum temperature was 2.4 degrees less than average whereas the minimum temperature was 0.2 degrees higher.

The IMD forecast mentioned that the city could expect 14 C minimum temperature on Monday. The change can be due to northeasterly to easterly winds which were earlier blowing northerly to northeasterly, said experts.

For Gujarat, the IMD forecast mentioned that on Monday and Tuesday, the region could experience 2-3 degrees rise in minimum temperature after which there would be a drop of 2-3 degrees on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

135,['3/02/2020'],Kolkata: Chitpore level crossing may be ready by end-February,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Work on in full swing for the approach roads towards the level crossing

KOLKATA: The construction of the level crossing and approach roads on either side of the Chitpore rail yard has gained momentum after the sanction from the railways. The level crossing to the west of the frail Cossipore Bridge is meant for goods vehicles. The goods vehicle movement has suffered a serious setback ever since Tallah Bridge was made out of bounds for them in early November.

The officials are eyeing an end-February deadline to complete the work.

There are two sidings of Chitpore yard. The southern siding handles salt and northern siding is meant for perishable items and other goods. Because of the complete snapping of north-south corridors, the wagon load of goods were rotting at warehouses. Moreover, the warehouse space has always been limited, said a goods transporter. The transportation cost, thus, spiralled because of a detour by goods vehicles.

Hitherto, goods vehicles used Tallah Bridge to move in this region. But from November, Tallah Bridge was made out of bounds for heavy vehicles. A height bar prevented goods vehicles to travel along Cossipore bridge as well.

The proposal for the level crossing was mooted by chief secretary Rajiva Sinha during a high-level meeting on January 1 with senior officials of the Eastern Railway. A task force, including DRM (Sealdah), an engineer of the railways and principal secretaries to the state public works and transport departments, was formed to look into the design that would be prepared by the railways. The state needs to pay Rs 14 crore to the railways to construct the level crossing.

That's why the state government insisted on the availability of level crossing from Bagbazar-end to Turner Road so that goods vehicles can move to-and-fro Chiria More using this level crossing, said a PWD engineer. ""We are now working hard to complete the level crossing by end of February. The work of approach roads on either side is on in a war-footing,"" he added.

Once the level crossing is ready, we can also divert buses along this route as PWD has issued caution against the health of Cossipore bridge as well.

It has been decided after an inspection on Saturday, transport department will convene a meeting with the railways and the police to work out the modalities for constructing the level crossing. Engineers, meanwhile, will work together to identify the exact quantum of railway land that will be required for building the new bridge, parallel to the existing one in Tallah.

Both acts came after the damage to eight vehicles parked in Warje-Malwadi area by eight men late on Friday. The Warje police on Saturday arrested Vishal Ashok Sonawane (24) of Warje and booked seven of his accomplices for the damage.

The suspects, armed with sharp weapons, went on the rampage to terrorise the local residents. They damaged a school van, scooters, and an autorickshaw. A hunt is on for Sonawane's accomplices.

Hemant Rajendra Ingle, a ration shop owner from Sahakarnagar area, has lodged a complaint with the police in the Sahakarnagar incident. The suspects damaged 30 two-wheelers (motorcycles and scooters), the wind shields of two tempos and two autorickshaws.

The Sahakarnagar police have booked three unidentified men for damaging the vehicles parked on a public road, and hurling abuses.

Deputy commissioner of police (Zone II) Shirish Sardeshpande, assistant commissioner of police Shivaji Pawar, senior inspector Nandkumar Bidwai and others surveyed the damage. Sardeshpande said vandalism took place around 2.30am.

Sub-inspector Gaurav Dev from the Sahakarnagar police station said, ""Local residents who came out of their houses saw three men, one of them with an iron rod. They walked around in the area with the iron rod damaging the parked vehicles .""

Dev said local residents told the police that the trio was drunk, shouting and abusing loudly.""The reason behind their act is not known. We are trying to ascertain their identities. The area does not have CCTV surveillance,"" he said.

Two police teams have been formed and they are combing the area to trace the suspects. Dev said they suspect the vandals could be local residents.

Sachin Aglave, whose two-wheeler was damaged, said he had bought the motorcycle two years ago. ""It was dear to me. The vandals damaged the console, the mudguard and the petrol tank. I am sad.""

Another resident, Prashant Kale, whose vehicle was also damaged said ""I use my motorcycle daily for my work. I cannot imagine that somebody can do this.""

Another group of vandals used sticks and rods to damage 13 vehicles at Thermax Chowk in Pimpri on Sunday morning.

The Pimpri police said the suspects damaged two-wheelers, a car and autorickshaws parked on a road around 3am on Sunday.

The suspects came to the spot on a motorcycle and then damaged the vehicles.

The reason for the vandalism is not known.

CHENNAI: Time is ripe to have tomato soup and chutney.

Due to a good monsoon and increased supply, the retail price of tomatoes has come down 10 and touched 15 in city. The native variety is available for 8 a kilogram at the Koyambedu market and it is available for 13 to 15 a kilogram at retail shops. The Bengaluru variety is available at Rs 15 in wholesale and 30 to 35 a kilogram in retail stores.

Traders at Koyambedu market said supply of tomatoes has increased by 50% in the past few weeks. ""We used to get 40 loads of tomatoes every day. Now it has increased to 60 loads a day due to increase in produce,"" said V R Soundararajan from the Koyambedu Traders' Association.

In Madurai, the price dropped to 7 a kilogram at wholesale markets and to 10 in retail markets. Last month, the wholesale rate was 40 a kilogram.

With prices dropping, the Madurai central market which gets tomatoes from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh has stopped getting supplies. ""The price is too low to meet the transport cost so they are dumping it in the borders or stopping with Chennai,"" said Mattuthavani wholesale vegetable market president P S Murugan.

Cabbage and raddish are being sold at 10 a kilogram and a kilogram of kohlrabi costs 15. ""They are the cheapest vegetables available now,"" said a vendor in T Nagar.

However, prices of coconuts and drumsticks have increased in recent weeks. While a coconut sold for 25 in the wholesale market, drumsticks sold for 110 a kilogram. ""Once local produce reaches the market, these prices will come down,"" a vendor said.

AHMEDABAD: You can now get some relief from the daily squabbles over parking space with your colleagues at your office complex. In a few days, you will be able to apply for a monthly to annual on-street parking permits at your local Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation ( AMC ) zonal office.Long duration and overnight parking on public roads, be it outside residential societies which are short of space or busy commercial complexes, will not be free any more. After implementing on commercial streets’, the same permit system will be extended to residential societies in a short time. Only 40 per cent of the road stretches will be designated for permit holders.Parking permits will be demand-based, and shall be issued to individuals, while group permits for institutions, corporates, shops and establishments, clubs to hospitals and in some time to residential societies as well. “The permits will not be restricted to just on-street but will even extend to nearby multi-level parking lots as well. The latter will have discounted monthly rates in comparison to onstreet parking permits,” said a senior AMC official. The permit system is flexible such that even institutions or groups of individuals can approach the AMC to designate a road as a parking stretch. “The AMC will examine the road stretch to see whether there will be traffic hindrances,” adds the AMC estate official.The parking rates will be calculated on the basis of daily 12 hour parking charges on any street and multiplied over the number of days of permit sought from the AMC. “We will be installing an electronic parking monitoring system to keep track of space available,” adds the official. The officials also added that discussions are on to halve the monthly permit charges while keeping the 12 hour charges as base rate.Municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra said, “Our permit system will be unique in the country, and an individual can approach us for parking space.” On the comprehensive parking policy for the entire city Nehra said that the policy is ready and is being examined by the legal department in the wake of recent high court and Supreme Court orders over the issue.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73886538,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-908598,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-you-can-get-long-term-on-road-parking-permits/articleshow/73886306.cms
139,['3/02/2020'],3D print helps save 7-year-old's leg in Gujarat,"This story is from February 3, 2020

The team of doctors included Dr Salunke, Dr Mayur Kamani and Dr Vishal Bhabhor

AHMEDABAD: Geeta (name changed), 7, a native of Devbhoomi Dwarka , complained to her parents of an unusual swelling near her knee in October last year. When the doctors diagnosed it as a cancerous tumour , her parents feared the leg might need amputation to save her.

Three months later, she underwent a complex surgery at Gujarat Cancer Research Institute (GCRI) at Civil Hospital where a team of doctors used a novel method to ensure that her tumour was removed and her own bone re-fixed after cryosurgery - a process where the tumour is exposed to liquid nitrogen at -185 degrees celsius.

Dr Abhijeet Salunke, orthopaedic oncosurgeon, GCRI, said that in usual cases, a tumour so close to the knee leaves no other option but to cut it from the spread above, resulting in loss of limb. ""With help of a local designer, we got the exact replica of the tumour-affected femur (thigh) bone along with a jig. The 3d model was created based on CT and MRI scans and gave up to millimetre precision,"" he said.

The surgery, that lasted for six hours last week, included the surgeons cutting exact 18 cm of the bone along with the tumour with the help of a jig - an instrument to guide the precise cuts - designed for the patient, putting the bone in liquid nitrogen for 20 minutes, treating it and then affixing it again at the same spot with the tumour removed. The team of doctors included Dr Salunke, Dr Mayur Kamani and Dr Vishal Bhabhor. The tumour weighed 1.5 kg and caused blood loss of 500 ml.

Dr Shashank Pandya, director of GCRI, said the condition the girl had is identified as Ewing's sarcoma of femur bone. ""It was just 3cm away from the knee joint and was difficult to remove through conventional methods. The girl's surgery is successful and we are hopeful she will be back on her feet nine months after the treated bone establishes connection with adjoining bones,"" he said.

The team members claimed that it was a unique surgery using a combination of 3D printing and cryosurgery. They added that while computer-aided surgery can perform a similar feat, the method they employed is much more economical and suitable for countries like India.

The standard of upkeep has declined

CHANDIGARH: The artful hands of Nek Chand gave a junkyard a new life as Rock Garden but a falling standard of upkeep since he left threatens to kill this wonder of the modern world. The tree cover of this major international tourist attraction is dying a slow death.Hundreds of people visit the place daily to admire hundreds of sculptures that Nek Chand made out of discarded material such as construction waste, smashed tiles, broken bangles, shattered ceramics, rags, cracked switchboards, cast-off lanterns, and mountain cobble. For a tourist place that is just 62 years old, Rock Garden's speed of decline is shocking.The sculpture park was born in the cover of a forest full of green trees on all sides. The trees that came in the way of the sculptures were incorporated in the art. Since now these trees added to the beauty of the stone figures, it saved them from cutting. Genius, you would say, but with the passage of time, a poor upkeep started killing these trees that are as much as part of Nek Chand's work as the concrete and stone that he used.The management of Rock Garden is now in the hands of the UT administration. The jurisdiction of Nek Chand Foundation is now limited. Anuj Kumar, son of Nek Chand, said: ""We have no say in the management of Rock Garden. I did point out to the administration that the garden's trees needed care. Despite being notified, the UT authorities took no action to save the trees.""After months of trying to persuade the civic authorities to clear concrete from around the tree bases, a local NGO ( non-governmental organization ) has filed a petition in National Green Tribunal (NGT) against the trend of strangling the trunks while concretizing the sidewalks. L R Budaniya, an environmentalist working ardently to save the city's environment said: ""By cementing the tree base, they kill the roots first and then the tree itself, gradually. Gardeners call this area protected root zone, and it should be unoccupied for the health of the tree. When concrete is put over the roots or the soil dug up to build patios or cemented structures, the damage to the roots is irreparable.""Concrete-covered trees are common inside Rock Garden and no one cases to give these trunks any breathing space. Budaniya said: ""Looking at how the trees have been cemented without anybody's noticing it, one can't believe that the area is a protected forest. The other departments might not be aware of the ill effects of cementing the tree bases, but being a custodian of our environment, the forests wing has no excuse for this negligence.""One of Rock Garden's long-time visitors, Gurpreet Singh, said: ""I have been admiring this marvel since my childhood but am unfortunate to also see this piece of grand art dying a slow death of late. When the great Nek Chand was alive, these walkways were not cemented and trees stood tall and green in the mud. Now all the area around the roots is cemented, which has strangulated the trunks. The UT administration has a duty to save the beauty of Rock Garden.""",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73886636,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-842875,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-rock-garden-trees-turning-into-stone/articleshow/73886545.cms

CHENNAI: The city airport may be growing, but it’s at such a sluggish pace that it may soon lose its tag as the country’s fourth busiest airport in terms of total passengers handled. It may lose the position to Kolkata or Hyderabad. Chennai, despite geographical advantage, is struggling with limitations in ground infrastructure due to inadequate space in passenger terminals and runways.Delhi is the busiest airport in the country followed by Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai. Kolkata is in fifth place followed by Hyderabad.Chennai airport registered a marginal increase of 1.6% in passenger traffic in April-December 2019 compared to the period last year. But Kolkata is edging closer to Chennai with a faster growth rate of 3.8%. While Chennai handled 1.73 crore passengers in April-December 2019, Kolkata and Hyderbad airports were close behind, handling just 3.82 lakh and 4.58 lakh passengers less. An AAI official said airlines’ interest to connect Kolkata with foreign destinations and connectivity to small towns has put Kolkata airport on a faster path of growth.Meanwhile, Bengaluru is way ahead of Chennai in terms of passenger volume. The airport handled 2.51 crore passengers in the said period, fuelled by an increase in domestic flights. The airport is also expanding its international operations, using as leverage its location in the middle of the peninsular south.AAI had plan to convert Chennai into an international hub like Dubai or Singapore because it is located on the intercontinental air routes — it lies in the middle of the air route that links Europe-Middle East with Southeast Asia and Australia. But it did not take off because of poor planning and slow construction of facilities.An AAI official said city airport also could not campaign with airlines and businesses the way a private airport could do to boost the number of flights. “Bengaluru overtook Chennai because of a robust business climate there and a full fledged airport with no limitations in ground infrastructure,” he added.Air Passengers Association of India national president D Sudhakara Reddy said: “The city airport can be considered one of the worstmanaged airports in our country. Promises to upgrade toilets, immigration and other facilities have not been carried out. Inline baggage handling systems were installed after a seven-year drag. How can you expect to see growth? Many large industrial groups of Chennai ask their international visitors to land in Bengaluru and take them to their plants around Oragadam, Sriperumbudur, Hosur by car. Bengaluru and Hyderabad offer top class service.”",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73886650,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-406774,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/despite-advantages-chennai-airport-grows-at-snails-pace/articleshow/73886663.cms

The roti-making business was not planned but started by chance

AHMEDABAD: For those who require a few hundred rotis for a wedding reception or find it burdensome to cook rotis at home, the "" roti lane "" in the Walled City area of Jamalpur is the go-to place. A dozen-odd families here earn their livelihood by preparing and selling rotis .

While marriage reception orders for rotis do come in regularly, what keeps their business going steady are requirements of the roadside eating joints of the city.

These eateries, along with many hotels, purchase hundreds of rotis from these roti-makers every day. Each family prepares a minimum of 500 rotis on a daily basis.

Interestingly, the now-flourishing roti-making business was not planned, but took off by chance. ""Our houses are located along the road and we make rotis sitting just outside our doorstep. People passing by used to inquire if we sell the rotis and that is how we thought of making and selling rotis,"" said Raisa Aapa Chhipa, one of the roti makers of Jamalpur area of the city.

Raisa Aapa used to work as a domestic help earlier, but roti-making is now her full-time profession. ""My two daughters and I make rotis for our living. We make about 500 rotis every day,"" she said.

When the business started off a little over a decade ago, the families sold rotis for one rupee each. With flour prices constantly on the rise, they increased the price of each roti to Rs 1.50 about five years ago. More recently, about a year ago, some of the families hiked the price of each roti to Rs 2.50, while others still sell rotis for two rupees each.

Ayubbhai Kalujiwala, who sold retail readymade garments at the Bhadra market until a few years ago, now earns his living by making rotis. ""The readymade clothes business was not doing well. My family earns more by making rotis,"" he said.

Firoz Shaikh, who runs a roadside egg eatery in Khamasa area of the city, said he purchases 200 rotis everyday from those who prepare rotis in Jamalpur. ""I visit the lane everyday at around sunset and purchase the rotis. Customers prefer rotis instead of bread,"" he said.

For past five years, the city has always recorded the highest numbers of rapes across the state.Last month, when the Ahmedabad city police commissioner, Ashish Bhatia held a press conference to inform about crimes in the city, he did not provide figures of crime against women.

150,['3/02/2020'],Fresh ASQ survey: Patna airport jumps 223 places to be at 102nd,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Huge rush at Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport in Patna on Sunday.

PATNA: The rank of Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport- Patna in the Airport Service Quality (ASQ) survey improved from 325th during July to September to 102nd in the fourth quarter (October-December) of 2019, according to a recent report released by Airports Council International (ACI).

Thanks to constant increase in number of passengers and flights and ongoing construction work, the airport has achieved the overall 4.5 ASQ rating out of five in the fourth quarter, when compared to 3.56 ASQ rating in the third quarter of 2019.

According to the latest figures issued by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), Patna airport handled altogether 35,13,060 passengers between April and December in the current fiscal against 31,12,896 passengers it handled during the same period last financial year.

The ASQ survey based on the performance of the city airport on 29 parameters related to passenger services revealed that it scored perfect five in ease of making connections with other flights.

Patna airport director Bhupesh C H Negi said the improved rating was mainly due to the improvement in passenger amenities. ""Teamwork and collaborative approach of all stakeholders at the airport contributed to the improved ratings,"" he said.

Negi added, ""Helpdesk counter, new parking facilities, food kiosk and restaurant at terminal building and a pre-fabricated structure on eastern side of the airport went a long way in improving the ranking of the airport. New entry and exit routes have also been opened at the airport.""

Patna airport significantly improved in business/executive lounge with 4.42 rating, closely followed by shopping facilities (4.09), availability of bank/ATMs /money changers (4.58), restaurant and eating facilities (4.06), value for money of restaurant/eating facilities (4.11), internet access/Wi-Fi (4.53), speed of baggage delivery (4.28) and value for money of shopping facilities (3.99).

Slight improvement was witnessed in areas like ground transportation to/from airport, parking facilities, availability of baggage carts/trolleys, waiting time in check-in queue/line and passport, efficiency, courtesy and helpfulness of check-in staff, thoroughness of security inspection, ease of finding your way at airport, flight information screens and walking distance inside the terminal.

Negi said more check-in counters, X-ray baggage scanners and frisking booths would come up at the airport by March.

CHANDIGARH: A Zirakpur resident was booked for allegedly cheating a bank of Rs 20 lakh after taking a loan to purchase an SUV on forged sales letter and invoices.

The accused has been identified as Jatinder Pal Singh . Police said the accused had applied for loan at State Bank of India 's branch in Sector 8 to buy a Toyota Fortuner SUV in 2014. He allegedly produced fake invoices and sales letter at the bank and obtained a loan of Rs 20 lakh.

The fraud came to light when the accused stopped paying his monthly loan instalments after a few months. When bank officials reached his house, they found the accused was not living there. Later, bank officials checked with the vehicle agency and found that the accused had given a booking amount of Rs 50,000 for the SUV but later cancelled the deal and took the money back. SBI bank manager Mohinder Singh Lamba then filed a written complaint at SSP public window.

After verifying the facts, Sector 19 police registered a case under Sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.

He will be part of the board and report to executive chairman Marcelo Claure. He was also the CEO of General Growth Properties for eight years prior to his stint at Brookfield. General Growth Properties, one of the largest shopping mall operators in the US, was acquired by Brookfield in 2018.“We have led an exhaustive search to identify a collaborative partner who is dedicated to the future success of WeWork.

He said it has an exceptionally talented team and significant potential if it sticks to its shared values and maintain its members-first focus.WeWork, now controlled by SoftBank, said the co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham will remain through the transition period.

We-Work was rocked to the core after it withdrew its IPO following a tepid investor response and a crash in its valuation. Subsequently, founder Adam Neumann stepped down, and prime backer SoftBank came in with fresh funds to rescue it from going bust.The appointment shows that WeWork is trying to position itself as a real estate player focused on leasing out office spaces more than as a technology startup based on the shared economy principle. A lot of investor scepticism during the IPO road show was because of the lack of clarity on what exactly the company’s business model was.

155,['3/02/2020'],Idea of tax charter came up between 2 meetings,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman with minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur (left) in Parliament befo... Read More

NEW DELHI: It was during a quick exchange, while moving from one meeting to another in the finance ministry corridors, that principal economic adviser Sanjeev Sanyal brought up the possibility of a tax charter being part of the Budget with finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman .

The argument was that while the government had acted to assure taxpayers, particularly businesses, that they would not be subjected to harassment, discussion of a “trust deficit” just would not go away. Dodgy officials were sacked and assessment made faceless, but the edginess among taxpayers persisted.

More discussions followed as a search for global examples revealed that very few countries had considered such measures. The idea seemed to gain traction, particularly as the government remained concerned over the need to stamp out the perception of arbitrary action by the tax bureaucracy.

Sitharaman gave it a thought, but did not say much to Sanyal. If the proposal was to make it to the Budget, it would be shrouded in secrecy. The charter, which the minister said would spell out assurances to tax assessees, found the approval of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and became a much discussed element of the Budget.

Budget discussions, sources said, were on for the past several months. In fact, the process began soon after the first Budget of the Modi 2.0 government was presented. The slowdown in growth, woes of the auto sector, unprecedented rains and damage to crops presented an urgent situation.

While the government came out with major announcements like cuts in corporate tax, a Rs 25,000-crore package for housing and Rs 102 lakh crore for infrastructure projects, work on the Budget continued. The meetings often began at Sitharaman’s office at 10:30 am, broke a couple of hours later, and some times officials reconvened in the after noon.

The minister also undertook widespread interactions, in different cities, with sections of consumers, investors, trade and business. The feedback was noted and fed into the discussions. Some demands like GST rate reductions and other “breaks” were predictable. But other suggestions were more meaningful from the point of view of addressing regulation and credit blockages, holding back growth.

The wealth of detail the ministry evaluated, sources said, contributed to a Budget speech of record length. The emphasis was to establish that resource commitments were backed by plans and would not remain pledges. As she made her way through her speech, Sitharaman ignored suggestions that she sip some water. There were lozenges from road transport and highway minister Nitin Gadkari instead.

156,['3/02/2020'],UT to submit report on steps taken to control air pollution till December 2019,"This story is from February 3, 2020

CHANDIGARH: The Union government has directed the Chandigarh administration to submit details of steps taken to control air pollution in the city till December 31, 2019.

A senior UT official said they would soon submit the report to the Union government. Besides, they would also submit a report to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in this regard.

The UT, in its action plan to control air pollution, had submitted various plans from promoting battery-operated vehicles, green buffers along the traffic corridors and introducing intelligent traffic management system. The action plan was submitted to the Union government last year.

The UT had also submitted that they had already launched extensive drive against polluting vehicles and had even prepared an action plan to widen roads and improvement of infrastructure for decongestion of roads.

The other initiatives mentioned in the action plan includes synchronisation of traffic signals in the city, greening of open areas, and introducing water fountain at major traffic intersections wherever feasible with the use of tertiary treated water.

The UT submitted that the ambient air quality of the city was mainly affected by the construction and demolition waste and increase in the number of vehicles.

The UT had submitted, ""There has been an increase of around 60% in the number of vehicles in 10 years with no change in the length of roads. Increase of light motor vehicles (LMVs), basically cars, by more than 100% in the past 10 years in comparison to approximately 48% increase in two-wheelers. This has resulted in more congestion, ultimately contributing to air pollution.""

The UT had also stated other factors, too, including road dust re-suspension, horticulture waste, and stubble burning in the neighbouring states, leading to air pollution.

The administration is also working on promoting hybrid and electric vehicles. Two years ago, a team of the transport department had visited Nagpur to study charging stations' set-up.

Nagpur was the first city in the country to have electric vehicle charging stations in place. Chandigarh has the highest density of vehicles in India with around 12 lakh registered ones, including two-wheelers and four-wheelers. The number of vehicles per house on an average is two, which has led to a sharp deterioration in air quality.

To cut down the pollution level, the Chandigarh Transport Undertaking (CTU) will induct electric buses. At present, around 3,000 e-rickshaws are plying on the city roads.

BENGALURU: Some are beginning to call it the ‘India Mafia’, like the PayPal Mafia. The latter was used to describe the many former PayPal employees and founders who went on to found and develop other technology companies such as Tesla, LinkedIn, Palantir, SpaceX, YouTube, Yelp, and Yammer.The India Mafia of Satya Nadella (chief of Microsoft), Sundar Pichai (Google), Shantanu Narayen (Adobe), Sanjay Mehrotra (Micron), Nikesh Arora (Palo Alto Networks), George Kurian (NetApp), and now Arvind Krishna (IBM) are all heading some of the biggest technology companies in the world. There are others too, like Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, and Sanjay Poonen, COO of VMware. And of course, the latest appointment of Sandeep Mathrani at WeWork.What makes Indians so good in technology leadership? Vivek Wadhwa, distinguished fellow at the Carnegie Mellon University’s college of engineering at Silicon Valley, says the combination of formidable technical abilities with strong business acumen and management skills have enabled Nadella and Pichai to build the most valuable companies in the world.“But what people don’t realise is that they also have something which is usually missing in the tech world — a sense of humility and understanding of human needs. Too many of Silicon Valley’s leaders have grown up in its bubble, they are cut off from the realities of the world. They get lucky and begin to believe they are Gods. This is not a problem that Indiaborn leaders have,” he said.Something similar was pointed out by The Wall Street Journal in 2015 when it quoted a then recent cross-cultural study from Southern New Hampshire University that examined managers from the US and India. The study found that more Indian managers achieved the highest ranking in terms of leadership traits. Indian managers, the study said, are future-oriented, and had a “paradoxical blend of genuine personal humility and intense professional will...These leaders achieved extraordinary results and built great organisations without much hoopla.”Vijay Govindarajan, Coxe Distinguished Professor at Tuck at Dartmouth, also says that to lead in today’s world, a CEO must embody ‘Social Heart, Business Mind’. Indian-Americans have the ability to cultivate this,” he says.Indian CEOs are seen to have an uncanny ability to spot the “new” and turn disagreements and dissents within the firm into preparing it for the future. Nirmalya Kumar , Lee Kong Chian professor of marketing at Singapore Management University, calls it the “browning of the top management team”. Kumar says given the huge technology disruptions that are happening, companies are seeking CEOs who understand the evolving technological landscape and combine it with market insight.“It is easier to teach a technologist about markets and sales compared to bringing a marketing/sales person up to speed on technology. Previously, we needed CEOs with sales capability and an understanding of finance to compete in relatively undifferentiated, slow-moving markets,” he says. All of the India leaders built their careers as technologists, before getting into the sales and marketing side. Krishna, for instance, was a researcher for much of his career, and has co-authored 15 patents. Govindarajan says since every company is a digital company today, he expects more and more technologist CEOs, since domain knowledge is key for leading an enterprise.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73893412,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-109751,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-ceo-mafia-techies-with-a-social-heart/articleshow/73886762.cms

Widlife biologist Akhit Suthar

VADODARA: The vulnerable smooth-coated otters had been facing serious threat from poachers . The semiaquatic fish-eating mammal of the weasel family, that had made a comeback in central and south Gujarat in the past one decade only, already saw 53 animals being poached by hunters since 2011.

However, efforts by a city-based wildlife biologist to sensitize local communities on the poaching menace, not a single otter was killed in 2019.

Wildlife biologist Akhit Suthar mobilized local community including fisherman, aquaculture farm owners, woman, youth and tribal for otter conservation in Bharuch. Suthar, who works with Gujarat Ecology Society (GES) and is a member of International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Otter Specialist Group, held several meetings with local communities and also set up local information network to foil any poaching bid.

His efforts paid off last year when Suthar was one among the seven people from across the globe to be honoured by UK-based International Otter Survival Fund. Last month Suthar was awarded the 'Otter Oscars' under the research category for his research titled, 'Mitigation of illegal hunting and poaching of smooth-coated otters in south Gujarat'.

Suthar's work, which was funded by Wildlife Trust of India and Stop Poaching Fund had revealed that a gang of poachers, led by a Haryana-based man, has been targeting otters since 2011 for its water-resistant skin. The skin is smuggled to Nepal, Myanmar, China and Bhutan as it is used for making jackets, hats, mufflers and traditional skirts worn by women in China.

""This is a proud moment as this recognition encourages and helps us to work more for otter conservation and research in Gujarat,"" he said.

Other recipients of this award were from the USA, Scotland, Germany, Montenegro, Sri Lanka and Netherlands.

AGRA: Farrukhabad hostagetaker and murder convict, Subhash Batham , was a historysheeter as per police records. There were four FIRs, including theft and assaulting a Dalit, against his name. But, he was never suspected by local intelligence unit (LIU) or Mohammadabad police of making bombs.

The police said the ""illiterate"" man watched YouTube videos on bomb-making and kidnapping of children. On Sunday, superintendent of police, Anil Kumar Mishra, Farrukhabad, said, ""Neither Subhash nor his wife were social. The couple secretively constructed a 'bunker' with ill intentions which no one was aware of. They were jointly responsible for the [children] hostage situation.

When their neighbours were unaware, then how could the police know about it?"" According to Farrukhabad district police, a total of 145 crude bombs, including a cylinder bomb and a canned bomb along with wire, battery, tape, sutali (thread), 20 live cartridges, 11 used cartridges and one each 315 bore country-made rifle and pistol were recovered, but no one could sniff or had any idea from where he collected such a large quantity of weapons and explosive powder.

Subhash, who had arranged a fake birthday party for his oneyear-old daughter and then held more than 20 children as hostage at Kathariya village in Farrukhabad, was shot dead by police after nearly a 10-hour standoff. Angry locals later reportedly beat his wife to death.

""Around one-and-a-half months ago, Subhash was released from jail after being arrested by SOG team in a theft case. Scanning through mobile phone history recovered from his home revealed that he watched YouTube videos on bomb-making and kidnapping of children. Though, he was illiterate,"" said special operation group, Farrukhabad in-charge Dinesh Kumar Gautam. While LIU in-charge, Preeti Singh said, ""LIU had no idea about his ammo stock or from where he gathered the explosives.""

Niti Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar (File photo)

NEW DELHI: State governments will now have to accelerate their move on ease of doing business to remove bottlenecks for investors and the taxpayer charter will help instil confidence and end harassment, a top official said on Sunday.

“Most follow-up now has to be done at the level of the states. The Economic Survey gives the example of, if you want to run a restaurant, you need 43 clearances. In those 43 clearances, I doubt if more than one or two would be at the central government level, the rest would be municipal, state, that is where the rubber meets the road. Investment climate will be improved now by reforms of state governance and ease of doing business,” Niti Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar told TOI in an interview.

“One of the biggest obstacles to improving investor sentiment is tax terrorism, which now has been finally recognised. Now you have a taxpayers’ charter, you got the dispute-resolution mechanism. The government wants the tax system to be hands off and the PM has reiterated this several times,” said Kumar, while reacting to the Budget proposals unveiled by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday.

Kumar said the Budget proposals will help improve sentiment, raise investment and boost overall growth, which is estimated to slow to an 11-year low of 5% in the current fiscal year.

“The real rise in growth comes through investment and investment demand and there I am very happy to note the Budget has several measures to improve the return on investment and also the investor sentiment. The dividend distribution tax has been removed, the impact of 15% concessional rate of tax not just on manufacturing but also on power generation, the tax concession to sovereign wealth funds, the tax concession to the builders plus the tax dispute-resolution mechanism.”

“All these measures will help to improve investment, which in turn will improve growth. The second part is the 20% increase in capital expenditure. So within the constraints of the fiscal, these measures will boost investment and growth,” said Kumar, referring to the government’s move to relax the fiscal deficit target by 0.5 percentage points this year to boost spending.

Kumar said the Budget emphasis on improving the data system in the country would help usher in changes as the issue needs urgent attention. “Reliability, credibility, coherence, consistency and time — those are key features of a good statistics system. We must move towards that and sooner the better. We have neglected this for a very long time. Whatever it takes we must finish it in one or two years.”

After this, the miscreants may have allegedly culled out good quality groundnut from the bags and mixed cheaper quality into the bags to maintain weight,"" Vala said.

Apart from the adulteration, the gunny bags also weighed less, he added.

""We have registered a case and started investigation,"" said K K Zala, inspector, Junagadh police station.

In August last year in Jetpur of Rajkot district , a total of 30,000 sacks of groundnuts (containing 35kg each) were found to be mixed with sand and pebbles.

PATNA: BJP and RJD are focused on their booth level preparations for the upcoming assembly elections later this year. The two parties, slated to function as fulcrum for their respective coalitions are busy appointing their booth level agents (BLA-II) to interact with voters in their respective areas. There are 72,723 polling booths in the state.

""We have already constituted more than 67,000 booth level committees (BLCs) covering around 90% of the polling booths in state. Now, we have moved to the second stage of appointing BLA-II for the respective polling booths,"" BJP state vice-president Anil Sharma said. Sharma was the co-incharge of state BJP's four-tier organizational elections. A BLC has 11-20 members. Sharma also said the party's MLAs and district presidents have been asked to submit the list of BLAs to the district administrations. ""Instructions have been issued in this regard,"" he added.

During the 2015 assembly elections, RJD had appointed the highest number of BLAs among the political parties in the state - 53,000 compared to BJP's 48,000.

There are two kinds of BLAs: BLA-I appointed by the administration to work for the Election Commission and BLA-II appointed by the respective political parties to assist the voters or even mobilize them to cast their votes in favour of their party candidates on the polling day.

RJD vice-president and former MLC Tanveer Hassan said his party had already instructed its district presidents to continue with membership drive, while ensuring that the BLAs-II were also appointed without missing the deadline set by the Election Commission for that.

Even in terms of the party's primary members, the two parties appeared to be evenly matched, reaching the figure of around 1 crore. ""Last year, we had set the target of making 50 lakh primary members, but the number has reached around 1 crore - or around 80-90 lakh. Members are being made even today,"" Hassan added.

UP’s first Go-Abhyaranya will be set up near the Adwa dam (File photo)

VARANASI: The first Go-Abhyaranya ( cow sanctuary ) of the state, coming up on 27 bigha land surrounded by river, forest and hills in Halia region of Mirzapur district , will produce bio fertilizer. The bio fertilizer will give an impetus to the Yogi Adityanath government's bid of promoting organic farming in the state besides bringing in funds to meet its recurring expenditure.

Talking to TOI on Sunday, Mirzapur district magistrate Sushil Kumar Patel said, ""We are bringing up the Go-Abhyaranya on 27 bigha land demarcated for the project in Ajaria village of Halia block. It will accommodate 5,000 cattle.""

""The location of the proposed Go-Abhyaranya is ideal for keeping the cattle abandoned by their owners. The 27 bigha land has Adwa river and a barrage, which remains full of water round the year, on one side while there are forest and hills on other two sides. It will be a low-cost project as no major construction is required for it,"" the DM added.

""Only construction of boundary and some shades will be needed. We will also undertake massive forestation for proper shade and green cover in the Go-Abhyaranya. The total cost would be estimated with the completion of detailed project report,"" said Patel.

In initial stage, the government will assist the Go-Abhyaranya in arranging fodder for which the stubble being burnt by farmers would be purchased. Farmers will stop burning stubble which increases air pollution, the officer said.

The state government is already promoting organic farming for which bio-fertilizers will be required on large scale, especially in areas on the banks of the Ganga. This Go-Abhyaranya will emerge as a major producer of bio-fertilizers, which will help in generating revenue to meet its expanses in future, the DM said. There are also plans to keep cows of different breeds in the Go-Abhyaranya.

CM Yogi Adityanath had laid the foundation of the proposed Go-Abhyaranya in Mirzapur on January 29.

The plant operates from 8am to 5pm at the moment

CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh municipal corporation is all set to run city’s only construction and demolition (C&D) waste plant in two shifts for its optimum utilisation. A decision to this effect has been taken as the civic body expects more C&D waste from Daddumajra dumping site, since legacy waste mining has started disposing of around 5,000 ton of garbage.

Currently, the plant operates from 8am to 5pm, but after the double shift begins, it will run again from 5pm to 11pm.

“We have planned second shift for six months initially to assess the overall functioning of the machines in two shifts. Further decision will be taken after that. It will cost around Rs 38 lakh. As per plan, we need seven employees, lighting arrangement, additional JCB machines, trucks, vehicles and other related infrastructure. Comprehensive details have been worked out in this regard,” said a municipal corporation official.

“The Pune-based private company, which has taken up the work to remove legacy mining from Daddumajra dumping site, will transport C&D waste from Daddumajra to the plant, situated in Industrial Area, Phase II. Therefore, Chandigarh municipal corporation will not bear absolutely no expense on transportation of the waste,” he added.

As per the records of MC engineering department of the, currently the plant is processing around 115-120 metric tons of construction and demolition waste every day in the plant and it is expected to get double the quantity after they start getting waste from Daddumajra site.

“We are expecting to get 225-250 metric ton of C&D waste after the material is transported from legacy mining. Since the quantity of the dump is huge at Daddumajra, we will keep getting the raw material from there to process for longer period,” he said.

After processing the C&D waste, the machines produce recycle aggregates like stones and gravel, and mixes all types of debris to finally throw up concrete and concrete-related materials. Further, from concrete they make tiles, curb channels and paver blocks to be used in works done by the municipal corporation. Besides, the raw material also provides silt, which also gets utilised in filling work in the construction of buildings.

Since there is no other space left, the UT officer flats at the IT Park have been offered, where residential towers are coming up for the Punjab and Haryana governments and the Chandigarh administration.

""We have to construct eight towers, having 28 flats in each tower, at the IT Park for different government bodies. The Haryana government has already demanded three towers, while Punjab has asked for two. Moreover, four towers have been planned for the MLAs and offer has been given to them. There are also chances that both Punjab and Haryana governments may ask for more towers, and at least one tower will be there for the Chandigarh administration,"" a senior officer of the Chandigarh administration said.

""The cost of each flat will be approximately Rs 2 crore, and every flat will have four rooms and one servant room. This is first of its kind location, where such number of luxurious towers are coming, so every government organisation is showing interest to buy flats in Chandigarh,"" he added.

GANDHINAGAR: While movements and counter-movements have risen over scheduled caste and scheduled tribe reservations , the Gujarat government is set to enact a legislation by which sub-plan expenditure of government funds on scheduled castes (SCs) and scheduled tribes (STs) will have to be based on their their share in the population. Thus an estimated Rs 10,000 crore will be available for welfare SCs and STs, if such legislation is implemented.For several years, it has been observed that funds meant for the welfare of SCs and STs have been diverted to other departments. The move for the new legislation has great political significance, given reservations issue.According to a constitutional mandate, every state and the Union government must make its minimum allocation of funds for SCs and STs in proportion to their population in that respective state.Governments can allocate greater budgetary spending but cannot spend less than the proportion of SCs/STs in the general population on schemes for their welfare.The central policy think-tank Niti Aayog also directed states to follow this constitutional provision in budget allocation.However, the Gujarat government, has not been following this and has been allocating smaller budgets under the SC/ST sub plans, a clear violation of constitutional provisions.According to the 2011 census, the SCs make up 7.09% and STs 14.75% of the state's population. For many years straight, the Gujarat government has been allocating smaller budgets than mandatory for SC/ST welfare. The maximum allocation made by the state government so far under the SC sub-plan has been 4.98%, while the maximum allocation made so far under any ST sub-plan has been 13.7% of the total budgetary allocation.A top government official confirmed that the state government plans to introduce legislation to ensure that budget allocation under the SC/ST sub plans are in proportion to their population. ""With this decision, spending on the welfare of SCs/STs will grow substantially. Around Rs 10,000 crore will directly go to these communities if such legislation comes into force,"" the official said.The official admitted that as of now, apart from the tribal development and social justice and empowerment departments, other departments spend paltry amounts of their allocation on the welfare of members of SCs and STs. Also, funds of the social justice and tribal development departments are also being used for activities other than welfare of members of these deprived sections.

173,['3/02/2020'],Streatham attacker Sudesh Amman has family in Sri Lanka and was under police surveillance,"This story is from February 3, 2020

LONDON: A knife-wielding terrorist who was shot dead by police in London on Sunday during a crazed stabbing spree has been named by police as Sudesh Mamoor Faraz Amman , a convicted Islamist terrorist who has extended family in Sri Lanka .

The 20-year-old ISIS and al-Qaeda supporter stabbed two people in south London in broad daylight on a busy high street just before 2 pm in what Metropolitan police quickly declared as an “Islamist-related terrorist incident”.

Amman was jailed in December 2018 aged 18 for Islamist-related terrorist offences at the Old Bailey but was released from prison early just days ago. He is thought to have been living in a South London bail hostel when he carried out the attack.

Wearing a fake explosive vest, he stole a £3.99 10-inch kitchen knife from a convenience store and stabbed two people in Streatham High Road, leaving one man, in his 40s, in a life-threatening condition. Plainclothes police officers who had been following him on foot, shot him dead outside Boots pharmacy with handguns, in scenes reminiscent of an action movie, before hordes of armed police arrived.

Next specialist explosives officers and additional armed officers were called in to deal with the device around his body which was found to be a hoax suicide vest.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi said “The suspect has not yet been formally identified, however, given the circumstance of the incident, we are confident that he was Sudesh Amman, aged 20. Armed officers, who were part of a proactive counter-terrorism surveillance operation and were following the suspect on foot, were in immediate attendance and shot a male suspect dead at the scene. The suspect had been recently released from prison where he had been serving a sentence for Islamist-related terrorism offences.”

Witnesses also spoke of a police car crashing nearby in the rush to get to the scene.

In December 2018 Amman, then an 18-year-old student at North West London College, living in Harrow, had pleaded guilty to 13 counts of possessing and distributing terrorist documents via Skype and was jailed for three years and four months. He had been arrested in May 2018 by armed police.

The Old Bailey heard that he had tried to radicalise his own family, by sharing Al-Qaeda propaganda in a family WhatsApp group, and sharing bomb-making manuals on Skype, exposing his five younger brothers aged 11 to 15, and extended family in Sri Lanka to jihadist material.

After his arrest, police found bomb-making and knife-fighting manuals on his digital devices, as well as ISIS videos depicting graphic violence.

In online messages, he pledged allegiance to Islamic State, said ""the Islamic State is here to stay"", and said he considered ISIS to “be the best thing to happen to Islam”.

He also spoke about Muslims in London “being massacred” and “put in conditions worse than concentration camps”, and said, “the Quran gave permission to rape Yazidi women”.

In a raid of his home, where he lived with his mother and brothers, police officers found a black flag, a combat knife, and an air gun.

The court heard he had sent beheadings videos to his girlfriend and advised her to kill her ""Kafir"" (“non-believer”) parents and that he had fantasised about carrying out terror attacks with knives and acid.

The then head of the Met Police counter-terrorism command Acting Commander Alexis Boon said at the time of his conviction: “His fascination with death in the name of terrorism was clear in a notepad we recovered from his home. Amman had scrawled his ‘life goals’ in the notepad and top of the list, above family activities, was dying a martyr and going to ‘Jannah’ - the afterlife.”

The two victims of Sunday’s attack, a man in his 40s and a woman in her 50s, were rushed to South London hospitals. The man, who witnesses said was stabbed in his stomach, was initially in a life-threatening condition. However, by late Sunday night, D'Orsi said “we are thankful that following his treatment at the hospital, this is no longer the case. “

A woman in her 50s, who witnesses said was stabbed in the back, had non-life threatening injuries and has now been discharged from hospital. Another woman in her 20s has minor injuries - believed to have been caused by glass shattering following the discharge of the police firearm. She continues to receive treatment at the hospital.

LUCKNOW: As icy winds show no signs of relenting, the city is witnessing the longest spell of cold with high wind chill factor of winter season, at least in last 10 years.

No relief is likely till Tuesday as weathermen predicted that northwesterly winds coming from snow-fed mountains of Himachal Pradesh will continue to blow in the city.

State Met director JP Gupta said, ""Temperatures may rise by a couple of degrees and cold conditions may abate from Wednesday when moist and comparatively warm easterly winds from Bay of Bengal are expected to replace northwesterlies.""

According to weather experts, icy winds with high chill factor were responsible for cold in January which also continues in February which usually witnesses pleasant condition with moderate temperature.

Heavy rain in the city in January and moderate to heavy snowfall at regular intervals in the hills, particularly in Himachal Pradesh, are the main reasons behind chill in the wind. Five strong western disturbances that hit the Himalayas in quick successions in January are responsible for high precipitation and snowfall. Normally, January witnesses 2-3 western disturbances. The northwesterly winds brought chill generated after snowfall in the hills to the plains, including Lucknow, which was already reeling under intense cold because of rain. This kept temperature below normal for the better part of January and made people shiver despite bright sunshine during the day.

Normally, intense cold with high wind chill lasts for 10-15 days in January but this year it continues for 40 days with a couple of breaks of 2-3 days.

Fed up with the senior cop's remark, the two sisters - Vandana and Jiya - have sought CM Nitish Kumar's intervention to seek justice for the killing of their father Ashok Kumar.

Two of the six accused - Md Gaffar Nadaf and Md Hasim - of Gisiara were arrested on October 8 with the help of some local residents. However, the main accused, Randhir Singh, is still at large.

When the two sisters reminded Sitamarhi SP Anil Kumar of the promises made by him to arrest the culprits within 24 hours, the latter reportedly told them, ""Woh to police 'jumla' tha."" Vandana, an MBA, and her younger sister, Jiya, who is pursuing postgraduation , were taken aback. Their repeated pleas to the SP to instruct the investigating office to arrest the main culprit at the earliest went in vain.

A visibly upset Vandana said, ""The moment we heard these words from a senior police officer, we lost our hope of getting justice. We then decided to meet DGP Gupteshwar Pandey and additional chief secretary (home) Amir Subhani. We came to Patna in the hope of getting justice.""

On January 27, the two sisters met the DGP and narrated their ordeal. According to them, the DGP talked to the Sitamarhi SP over phone and inquired about the murder case. After a pause, the state police chief reportedly told the girls, ""I can't do anything."" The 'helplessness' of the DGP in ensuring the arrest of the main culprit left the girls shattered.

Sitamarhi SP Anil Kumar said the proclamation notice has already been issued against the remaining accused and the chargesheet submitted against two arrested persons. ""Raids are on to nab the remaining accused and security has been provided to the two sisters,"" he said on Sunday. When asked about the girls' 'jumla' allegation, the SP said: ""No comment.""

""We have sought an appointment with chief minister Nitish Kumar,"" the two sisters told this newspaper. Earlier, Vandana had sent her application through an email on December 9, 2019 seeking CM's intervention. They had also sent letters to President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 9 last year.

Their ordeal didn't stop here. They are being sent lewd messages on their cellphones. ""The local police didn't take notice of our complaints. The situation has come to such a passe that the accused is threatening us and other members of the family. He is roaming free in the village. The police, on the other hand, say he is absconding,"" they lamented.

On January 21, the Patna high court rejected the anticipatory bail application of Randhir, a resident of Belahi under Runnisaidpur police station in Sitamarhi district.

The condition of the slain ex-mukhiya's wife, Ram Kumari Devi , has worsened. Apparently peeved at police's reluctance, she said, ""It seems the police officials are waiting for something to happen. We are at our wit's end what to do now and whom to approach for justice.""

KOCHI: Groundwater levels in the state have been fluctuating for the last two years, with intense yet erratic rainfall recharging the water table. For the second consecutive year, groundwater levels rose by as much as 4 metres in some districts, according to data collated by the central ground water board (CGWB).According to the CGWB’s November 2019 report on groundwater levels submitted to the state government, nearly 80% of the annually monitored wells have seen a rise in water levels. Of the total 1,388 monitored wells, 1,333 registered a rise while 52 recorded a fall. A spike of more than 4 metres was reported in isolated pockets of Kasaragod , Kollam, Alappuzha, Malappuram, Palakkad, Thrissur and Pathanamthitta districts while a decline of the same measure was noted in a few locations in Kannur, Malappuram, Thiruvananthapuram and Wayanad.CGWB officials said the comparison of data between the water levels of November 2018 and 2019 showed a rise in the order of 0.01 to 10.79 metres below ground level (mbgl) with a fall in the order of 0.01 to 8.94 mbgl. Among the monitored wells, 79.69% registered a rise, while 19.08% posted a fall.Experts says that more than 60% of the wells dug in the state are not being used or even properly maintained.“With the arrival of piped water, most people just abandoned their wells; which soon got contaminated because of the lack of cleaning activity. The well ecosystem is a robust one. Ideally, these can be revived through what is called point recharging. All one must do is orient or direct the rainwater into them. In one’s own backyard, you can construct small stone bunds or vegetative embarkments to direct the water into the well. The water is saved through the efficiency of infiltration. Even a minor slope of just one centimetre can direct the water elsewhere,” said Sunny George, director, SCMS water institute.The shallow water level was seen in the range of 0-2 mbgl in Alappuzha, the coastal tracts of Ernakulam, Kollam, Thrissur and Kozhikode districts, as well as in the valleys of eastern Idukki, Palakkad, Wayanad and Kozhikode districts. The water level in the midlands ranged from 2-10 mbgl. Interestingly, a water level of more than 20 mbgl was noted in patches in Thiruvananthapuram, Palakkad and Kasaragod districts.A comparison of water levels post monsoon in November 2019 with that of pre monsoon in April 2019 indicated a rise in the range of 0-14.10 metres in most parts of the state, whereas fall in water level was noticed in certain small isolated pockets mainly in Ernakulam, Thrissur, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha districts.

VADODARA: Kevadia police has booked a travel agent for overcharging entry tickets to Statue of Unity. The SoU ticket coordinator noticed the entry ticket during barcode scanning and realized that the charge mentioned on it is more than the regular one.

According to the police, Ehsaan Saiyad got 10 express tickets at the entry of SoU on Sunday. He noticed that the tickets had Rs 1,260 written on them as entry fees whereas the actual entry fee is Rs 1,030 per person. The matter was reported to the cops who asked the tourists about the source of tickets. The tourists said that they had booked it from an agent based in Ahmedabad. During investigations, it came to light that the agent had tampered with the pdf format of the ticket and increased the prices to dupe the tourists. The accused duped them of Rs 2,300. In May 2019, a similar racket was busted when a Mumbai agency overcharged tickets of SoU.

Forensic team examines the bucket in which the body was found

KOCHI: The body of a premature baby was found inside a bucket that was floating in Perandoor Canal at Elamakkara in Kochi on Sunday evening.

The bucket was spotted by children playing near the canal on Makkaparambu Theeradesha Road . Elamakkara police said the baby was premature and appeared to have a growth of four months. Police said it was suspected to be either a still born or aborted baby, and someone might have dumped it in bucket and let it float in the canal to get rid of it.

According to police, the body was not decomposed which showed that it was abandoned in the last 24 hours (from Sunday evening). The umbilical cord was also found attached to the body and the bucket had water-like fluid inside it. Sources said a tag was also found inside the bucket which reportedly showed the date 31-01-2020. ""Also, on the tag it was written 'daughter of Sandhya'. It is not clear whether the tag belonged to any hospital or not. Police has collected the tag and started the probe,"" said the source.

Though the bucket was seen floating in the area since afternoon, no one gave attention to it as similar objects were often seen in the canal. But later the water currents brought it to one edge of the canal. When the children saw it, they mistook the body for a doll and picked the bucket. But when they realised it was a body, they called elders in the area and they alerted police.

The body is being shifted to mortuary of Ernakulam General Hospital after completing the inquest formalities. ""The police registered a case of unnatural death under section CrPC 174 and launched a probe to identify the parents. Information has been passed to all hospitals to check the details of any delivery,"" said a police officer.

One-year-old Gauri

KANPUR: Two days after the man who held 23 children hostage was killed in a police operation and his wife was lynched by villagers in Farrukhabad , UP Police has come forward to adopt their one-year-old daughter. Kanpur range Inspector General Mohit Agarwal told TOI that police department would bear Gauri ’s educational and all other expenses till she becomes self-reliant.

“I want her to become an IPS officer,” the IG said. “After all legal formalities, she would be adopted and we would send her to a good boarding school. I would keep her under my supervision,” he said. At present, the girl is under treatment at a hospital in Farrukhabad and is being looked after by women constables.

Gauri’s father Subhash Batham had taken 23 children hostage in Katheria village of Farrukhabad and was shot dead during the police operation on Thursday. Her mother Ruby, too, was killed after she was assaulted by angry villagers. Subhash had invited the children on the pretext of celebrating Gauri’s birthday and held them hostage in the basement of his house. Cops found Gauri in the house after her father was gunned down.

Facing four criminal cases, Subhash had served 12-year sentence in a 2002 murder case. He was recently in jail in a theft case and was released on bail one and half months ago. Police say that he had plotted the hostage drama to settle scores with those he accused of framing him in the murder case.

“Subhash and Ruby had married against their families’ wishes. Therefore, neither of the families came to take custody of the child,” the IG said, adding “Therefore, we decided to adopt her.” A police official said though the child is under shock, she is getting normal gradually. “She is being looked after by a team of doctors under strict vigil of police at a hospital. ” he said.

“We will take care of Gauri in such a manner that she never thinks she is an orphan,” the IG added.

LUCKNOW: Kalindi Sharma , wife of slain Hindutva leader Ranjeet Bachchan , claimed her husband was killed because of his right wing leanings and not in a robbery attempt as being claimed by police. Kalindi said they both used to go for morning walk regularly, but since Ranjeet started getting life threats he told her to take a different route and not follow him as he didn’t want to put her in danger.“He told me to take a different route saying I may also come on radar of his enemies since he received many life threats,” Kalindi told TOI on Sunday.Expressing threat to her life, she demanded district administration to help her meet CM Yogi Adityanath and demanded police security, renewal of her arms licence, a government job, financial assistance and a house. “Ranjeet was forming a Hindu Sena (army) and was vocal about making India a ‘Hindu Rashtra’. This had turned him into an eyesore for other hardliners who hatched the plot to kill him. He was getting life threats on social media and through web calls from India and abroad on regular basis for past three years after he formed his own political party — Vishwa Hindu Mahasabha — in 2017 and started taking part in debates on news channels. He also used to get sexually explicit content on his social media account from fake profiles of women trying to honey trap him. They asked about his daily schedule,” she claimed.Kalindi said they used to go together for morning walk since they got married in 2014, but after he floated the party and started getting threats, he asked her to go on a different route as he feared that I may also be targeted by his enemies. The couple lived on the sixth floor of Old Councillors’ Residence (OCR) building at Hussainganj. Their three-year-old son died in 2017.Recalling Ranjeet’s commitment to Hindutva, Kalindi said, “Once he told me, Kuchh bhi ho jaye sindoor mat pochhna, Hindu neta marta hai, vichardhara nahi (Don’t wipe away the vermillion from your forehead even after my death because a Hindu leader can die, Hindutava ideology never dies).”His cousin Aditya and his wife Jyoti had come to visit them on Saturday night. “On Sunday morning at around 5.30am, we left for morning walk like other days. Aditya joined Ranjeet and they went towards Parivartan Chowk via Hazratganj crossing, while I went to Lalbagh,” she said.“At around 7.30am, I was exercising at Lalbagh park, when Jyoti called me to inform that a few cops came to my house and said Ranjeet had been shot. Soon I got a call and police sent a vehicle to take me to Hazratganj police station. However, police took my phone and kept moving from one police outpost to another before taking me to the police station. They kept grilling me with questions about Ranjeet’s friends and enemies on the way,” she said.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73887331,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-208296,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wife-ranjeet-bachchan-asked-me-to-take-a-different-morning-walk-route/articleshow/73887162.cms
188,['3/02/2020'],Fifteenth Finance Commission bats for higher financial grant for municipal bodies,"This story is from February 3, 2020

New Delhi: Municipal bodies are likely to recieve at least Rs 29,000 crore grant during 2020-21, which is nearly 40% more than the assistance they received under the current fiscal. This is likely to bring some relief to the municipal bodies which are reeling under huge fund crunch and are failing to deliver.

The Fifteenth Finance Commission in its recommendations for 2020-21 has suggested this. The report was submitted on Saturday. A recent study carried out for the commission had flagged how the increasing dependence of civic bodies on grant from state governments and Centre was proving to be unsustainable.

According to the commission’s recommendations, municipal bodies in Uttar Pradesh would get a maximum of Rs 4,695 crore grant during the next fiscal year as compared to only Rs 2,460 crore. The commission has recommended huge increase in financial assistance to municipalities in Bihar , Assam , Himachal Pradesh , Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, to name a few.

While it has recommended Rs 2,416 crore grant to Bihar’s civic bodies as compared to only Rs 642 crore during this fiscal, the commission has suggested to increase the financial assistance to municipal bodies in Himachal Pradesh from only Rs 48.4 crore (2019-20) to Rs 207 crore. The commission has recommended reduction in grant to municipal bodies in case of a couple of states including Kerala and Maharashtra .

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday urged the Election Commission to ban UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath from campaigning in Delhi. AAP MP Sanjay Singh also demanded an FIR against Yogi for his alleged provocative remarks during his whirlwind election campaigns.

In a memorandum submitted to EC on Sunday, AAP stated that the UP CM had acted in gross violation of the model code of conduct by ""making objectionable statements with the sole intention of spreading religious hatred"" by associating chief minister Arvind Kejriwal with the statement of a federal minister of Pakistan. Yogi had also accused the AAP government of ""supplying biryani to the Shaheen Bagh protesters"".

AAP said Yogi's remarks were ""divisive"" and ""aimed at aggravating existing differences and creating mutual hatred between communities"".

The memorandum also pointed out that BJP's actions provoking enmity and spreading hatred on religious lines had resulted in an extremely unsafe situation in Delhi, as seen by the detention of a juvenile for attempting to shoot peaceful protesters at Jamia on January 31.

""To appraise the Election Commission, we had sought an appointment two days ago. Till now, we have received no response. It is very unfortunate that BJP derails the poll discourse in Delhi, but Election Commission is silently watching it,"" Singh said. ""If Yogi's remarks about Kejriwal are right, it should be proven. Otherwise, he should desist from talking such things,"" he added.

Talking to reporters, Singh said, ""If the EC doesn't give time to meet AAP delegates by 12pm on Monday, we will sit on a dharna at the EC office.""

The AAP MP said that Yogi had failed in governance and he was not ready to talk about electricity, water, roads, education and health. ""He has no positive stories from UP to tell the people of Delhi. Therefore, he tries to divide people on communal lines. How can a chief minister of BJP talk like this?"" asked Singh.

Singh said Yogi's remark about ""Goli aur Boli"" delivered during a public meeting at Narela on Saturday was dangerous. However, Yogi's bullet remarks were made in an altogether different context pertaining to law and order during Kanwar Yatra in UP.

193,['3/02/2020'],How not to become a victim of workplace gossip,"A popular Korean proverb says, ""Words have no wings but they can fly a thousand miles."" And words with no truth can travel even faster, right? Where there are people, there will be gossip and a workplace is one such place where gossip and rumours can spread even faster than wildfire. It doesn't matter whether there is any truth in it or not, rumours and idle gossip is not only disturbing, but it can sometimes even destroy a person's reputation. So, in case your workplace is full of colleagues who enjoy talking behind people's back, here's what you need to do to not become the victim of office gossip.Even if you are friends with your colleagues, always think twice before sharing personal details with him. It's good to have friends in the office but at the same time, you also need to maintain some space. Because you never know someday your trusted colleague might become a competitor and might use vulnerable information that you had shared earlier to attack you.Remember the old proverb that says, ""Who gossips with you will gossip about you."" Gossiping might seem like a harmless activity at first but once you get involved in it, there is no getting away. That is how gossip spreads, from one mouth to another. So, people who often gossip with you or share interesting news about others with you might end up making you an object of their gossip as well.Refrain from encouraging and entertaining people who talk about others. If you find a workplace friend or colleague talking behind someone's back, very politely excuse yourself. Or ask the person to not engage in such idle talk. It's true that doing so can make you very unpopular but it will also speak volumes about your professionalism and personality. And most importantly, by doing so, you are stopping a rumour from spreading.If you believe that you are surrounded by colleagues who engage in idle talks and this habit is affecting your performance, you can seek intervention from a third person, which in most cases is a representative of the HR department. You can share how such reckless behaviour affects the workplace culture and is not only harmful for the victim but is very detrimental for others as well. The HR professional definitely cannot take any official action against it (hello! no one can trace how a rumour originated or a gossip started, right?) but they can surely help you to handle the situation better.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73842230,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-2213986/73842230.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/relationships/work/how-not-to-become-a-victim-of-workplace-gossip/articleshow/73842271.cms

VADODARA: Organizers of a protest programme against Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) in the minority community dominated Tandalja area are likely to face punitive action as they had not sought permission for the sit-in.

The protesters, mostly women and children, had been sitting on a dharna in an open plot at Saudagar Park since Friday. On Saturday too, they continued with the protests and flashed anti-CAA as well as anti-RSS banners. On Sunday, the pandal was removed from the spot and power connection too was disconnected.

Police said that the pandal removed by the supplier.

""We learnt about the protest that started on Friday and started investigation into it. The organizers hadn't sought any permission from the police. We will book them for organizing gathering and using loudspeakers without any police permission,"" said Anupam Singh Gahlaut, city police commissioner.

Interestingly, when the cops began looking for the organizers, no one claimed responsibility for the dharna.programme

""The organizers had put the pandal for a day under the pretext of organizing a private programme. The event organizer who had rented them the pandal took it away on Sunday. We had no role in it,"" a senior police official said.

""They said that it was a voluntary dharna. But our investigations have revealed Sagir Ahmed Ansar, who was recently booked for sharing an inflammatory post against some doctors over CAA issue, was involved in organizing the dharna along with a councillor. Ansari was booked for the post and he is currently on anticipatory bail,"" a police official said.

When Ansari and others were called to the crime branch to inquire about their role in the protests, they denied having organized it.

UP CM Yogi Adityanath.

NEW DELHI: UP CM Yogi Adityanath continued his diatribe against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for the second consecutive day alleging about relations between AAP and Pakistan, while also questioning the real motive behind the protests at Shaheen Bagh.

Yogi arrived almost two hours late in both the public meetings scheduled at Harkesh Nagar and Jaitpur, which are just a few kilometres away from Shaheen Bagh.

""I would have arrived on time, but the Shaheen Bagh sit-in has brought disorder to Delhi. Thousands of people who go to Noida and Greater Noida have been facing salary cuts for not reaching office on time. Shaheen Bagh is being organised with mala fide intentions for causing anarchy and disorder. If you want to obstruct development and allow free rein of pro-Pakistan elements, then remain happy with people like Kejriwal,"" Yogi said.

The UP CM continued: ""When Article 370 was removed to integrate Kashmir, three people felt its pain - Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and Pakistan PM Imran Khan. All of them spoke the same language. Now Pakistan ministers are supporting Kejriwal and these protests. What is the relationship between AAP and Pakistan?""

""They feel pain whenever decisions are made in national interest. The Shaheen Bagh dharna is just an excuse. In reality, they are opposing abrogation of Article 370. They wanted to oppose the Ram temple in Ayodhya. The secret of their anxiety lies in the abolition of triple talaq,"" Yogi said.

He added, ""People have only two options in Delhi elections. One is the Modiji-led leadership on the issues of development, good governance and nationalism. The other is Congress and Kejriwal, who have secessionist intent (vighatankari manovriti) and schemes of destruction made with the intent of supporting anti-India Naxalites.""

Besides talking about how he carried out ""vasuli"" from people who damaged public property in UP, the monk-turned-politician spoke about how he contained the fears of riots during Kanwar Yatra with ""bullet persuasion.""

""Before 2017, there were many restrictions on kanwariyas. When BJP came to power, I told police that this is a yatra of Shiv bhakts. No obstructions should be placed. We don't do danga-fasad. What is the meaning of the attack on Kanwariyas? Jo hamla karega, to phir boli se nahi usko police ki goli samjhane ka karya kar degi (Those who attack will be stopped with the help of police bullets),"" Yogi said.

Alleging that AAP didn't allow the benefits of the Centre's schemes to reach Delhi's poor, Yogi said, ""In the past five years, Kejriwal couldn't open new schools, but wine shops (pathshala nahi madhushala) have come up in every mohalla.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk recently shared his fourteen-year-old master plan on Twitter . The CEO of electric car maker Tesla shared a photo of his blog from 2006 in which he had outlined a ‘master plan’. The tweet, which lists electric carmaker’s goals, had his mother Maye Musk respond in affirmation.Maye Musk retweeted her son’s tweet, saying, “ I remember that well.”The ‘master plan’ involves a set of three primary and one secondary goal. First is to build a sports car, the second is to utilise the money made from the sports car sales into making an affordable car. And the last part of the plan deals with using money made from the sale of the affordable car to make an even more affordable car. These three were the primary ones. Now, the secondary one is aimed at providing zero emission electric power generation options with the affordable cars that the company would build.The plan was to make affordable cars but Tesla cars cannot be classified as affordable ones. All of the company’s electric car models launched till date have been fairly expensive. With cars like the Model 3 listed on the company website at a starting price of US $39,990 (about Rs 28.59 lakh) and the new Model Y starting from US $52,990 (about Rs 37.88 lakh), the pricing is anything but affordable. Can Tesla step up to the challenge of blending innovation and affordability in the future?

204,['3/02/2020'],Wettest January in Kolkata since 2013 with 42.5 mm rain,"Frequent western disturbances caused untimely rain across the city in January this year

KOLKATA: The city had the wettest January since 2013 with rain record touching 42.5mm for the month, which was far higher than normal. Only once in the last 10 years did the city receive more rain during the first month of the year — considered to be the peak winter period when precipitation is negligible. Frequent western disturbances (WD) that are not unusual at this time of the year but fewer in number caused the sudden spurt in rainfall count, according to weathermen.Around four WDs affected Gangetic Bengal and Kolkata last month, leading to steady drizzles on several occasions. It paved the way for the chilly northwesterly wind and pulled the mercury down. Last Wednesday, the city had received 5.7mm rain that was followed by another spell of drizzle the next morning, triggered by a circulation. “WDs happen in January, but this time they have formed closer and induced ‘systems’ that generated rain in Bengal and Kolkata. When a WD forms, it induces cyclonic circulations or lowpressure troughs that often move eastward,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das.He added that WDs have formed over northern plains rather than the Himalayan region, which has impacted the city’s weather.“They have formed over UP, MP and Jharkhand and sailed into Bengal, leading to rain. It is because of such rainy spells that the temperature has dropped. With the systems sucking out all the moisture that obstructs the chilly northwesterly wind, they have paved the way for the latter to flow unobstructed. This has helped lengthen the cool spells in Kolkata this winter,” said Das.In 2012, the city had received 94.4mm rain, the highest for the month in the last one decade. The following year, the city had received 12.2mm rain. Since then, Kolkata never received more than 3.2mm rain in January till this year. “It was unexpected as winter in north and east India has been severe this time. Cloud cover and rain tend to pull the temperature up but we had short spells of shower repeatedly in January. So, the periods of high temperature were short,” said a weather scientist.Another rainy spell is in the offing, said weathermen. While the city is set to remain dry over the next 72 hours with temperature expected to drop to 14 degrees Celsius on Monday from Sunday’s 15.1 degrees Celsius. A lowpressure trough line is set to form over central India around February 5.“It could lead to rain in the western districts and Kolkata on Thursday and Friday. There is a possibility of thundershowers like the ones that happen in the premonsoon period. But it is too early to predict the intensity of rain in Kolkata ,” said Das.Under the impact of the rain, minimum temperature will again climb up while the northwesterly, which still remains active, will slow down.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73887507,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-863183,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wettest-january-in-kolkata-since-2013-with-42-5-mm-rain/articleshow/73887460.cms

CHENNAI: A man was arrested on Sunday for hurling a slipper at a Periyar statue on Anna Salai .

Police said P Narasimmalu, a 59-year-old resident of Triplicane , fled the spot before before passersby could nab him. The incident happened on Saturday.

Narasimmalu, a worker in the neighbourhood, went for a drink at a Tasmac bar in Chintadripet. He roamed the streets and threw the slipper at the statute located at the junction of Anna Salai and Swami Sivananda Salai. Pedestrians heard him shouting abuses, police said.

Alerted by locals, the Chintadripet police registered a case and arrested the man with the help of the CCTV camera footage. Narasimmalu was booked for creating nuisance in public. He was produced before a magistrate who remanded him in judicial custody.

208,['3/02/2020'],‘There are many thoughts moving inside your head … You have to learn to block them out’,"Esha Singh was only 13 when she won the national 10m air pistol, possibly the youngest-ever senior national title winner across all sport. More than wins, it’s her uncluttered mind and clarity which has got everybody talking. Siddharth Saxena probes the mind of a champion:

You won a senior national title at 13. How do you understand this sudden change?

I was shooting since I was nine. I was in the fourth grade when I happened to watch a friend of my father’s do some skeet shooting. He asked if I wanted to try it. We had no idea that kids could even pick up shooting at all, and it was felt to be too dangerous. It was then he suggested that we go to Pune, to Gagan Narang’s Gun for Glory academy just to see if I would be interested. I tried air rifle, then the air pistol which I found most comfortable. I was quite a sportive kid from the start, trying my hand at tennis and badminton because Sania Mirza, Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu, all Hyderabad girls, were such stars for us. But I settled for shooting because it was a unique sport. Initially my mother was worried when I picked up shooting: ‘Guns, just a child, is it safe?’ and all that. Then we entered the range and found out, ‘Oh, there’s something known as a sport gun’. There’s an air pistol also where the grip is just this small. Then she was fine with it.

You’re going to be 15. What does a gun mean to you?

It’s a completely different meaning today. Now, when I hear the word ‘gun’, I literally imagine all the parts, the mechanism, how do you shoot with it, etc. But back then, ‘gun’ was a really big thing for me, ‘Oh, it’s a gun,’ and all that. Now it doesn’t feel anything like that. I’m aware of the variety of guns, how they fire, etc.

How would you describe your approach to shooting? What kind of mental targets do you set?

Before a game, I just tell myself to go and play my game, to enjoy it. That’s all I say to myself. I don’t care about the score, I just don’t care who is watching me from behind, who is sitting in the audience. I’m just with myself at that time. It’s, ‘I chose this sport, I’m going out to enjoy it.’

As simple as that? How meditative is the experience?

You’re completely with yourself at that time. You have to really learn to control thoughts, so you need to do some meditation in the morning. Actually, whenever you have time. You really need to learn to block out thoughts.

Such as?

‘Will I hit the target?’ ‘Will I shoot out, hit out of the target?’ Or other random thoughts, ‘What if I fall ill tomorrow’? There are many, many thoughts which keep moving inside your head. You have to learn to block them out. Now I make notes of the mistakes and review them. Not all matches go according to plan. I really like those matches, where I can work [on the mistakes] and come back again.

You upstaged Manu Bhaker and Heena Sidhu to win the 10m air pistol national title in 2018. Theirs was already an interesting rivalry, are you the third axis in this rivalry?

I don’t see it as a rivalry, we’ve been on so many camps together. Manu’s been my roommate too. I’m going on 15, Manu will turn 18 in February and Heena is probably 31. We’re actually good friends. We talk a lot of things, girl stuff and not particularly shooting. Heena was an inspiration.

Do your schoolmates look at you differently now?

When I first shot a gun and everyone in school got to know of it, everyone in school was like, ‘Oh wow, she’s so small, she handles guns and all.’ But now I’ve hardly had any time to keep in touch with my classmates. I’m home only for two months a year. Last year was a very busy year, I was on international tours.

Do you miss growing up as a regular girl?

At some point, yes, but no also. I feel good, I feel lucky that my parents are so supportive. But there are some times, when my friends send me pictures of field trips or sports days at school and I’m not there. I miss it, but I also look at it as something I’m building up in my life. This is my goal; I have to do it. So, I have to sacrifice something.

Sometimes, I feel more pressure going to school after a very long time than I would feel ahead of big competitions. All the other students’ eyes on me, like, ‘Oh, ma’am’s finally come to school’.",sports,https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/index.jpg,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/more-sports/shooting/there-are-many-thoughts-moving-inside-your-head-you-have-to-learn-to-block-them-out/articleshow/73887881.cms

He was immediately administered CPR and other first aid and then rushed to hospital, where he was declared dead.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Sunday released its freebies-loaded manifesto titled ""Aisi Hogi Hamari Dilli - Congress Wali Dilli-Khushhal Dilli"" , which included 300 units electricity and 20,000 litres water for free, unemployment allowance of Rs 5,000 for graduates and Rs 7,500 for postgraduates and layoff compensation up to Rs 5,000 every month.

The party has also promised to open 100 Indira canteens offering subsidised meals at Rs 15, free metro and bus ride for people aged above 65 and subsidised fare for women, students and senior citizens.

A separate manifesto was released for environment, which promised earmarking 25% of the budget for improving the environment with multiple interventions like boosting green transportation, implementing dust control measures and increasing green cover. It promised to make Delhi the country's first electric vehicle city via Delhi Electric Vehicles Initiative (DEVI) with the procurement of 15,000 electric buses.

In the wake of the growing significance of protests at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi’s political discourse, Congress devoted a section of the manifesto to Citizenship Amendment Act. The grand old party promised that immediately after being voted to power, it will pass a resolution in Delhi assembly against CAA, challenge the Act in Supreme Court and ask the Centre to withdraw it. It promised not to implement NRC in Delhi and NPR in its current form.

After BJP, Congress is the second party to release its election manifesto. AAP is yet to release its manifesto. Unlike BJP and AAP, Congress has not mounted an aggressive election campaign. However, party functionaries vowed to surprise all with the election results.

Some of the schemes in the manifesto are already in place in Congress-governed states. Though it is focused on youth, unemployment, women, education, health, transport and environment, the promises appeared to be an effort by the party to woo the lower middle class, a major chunk that shifted to AAP in the 2015 assembly elections.

The Congress manifesto also promised free coaching for EWS students, apart from Rs 5,000 monthly pension for senior citizens, the differently abled and transgenders under Sheila Pension Yojna.

“Congress’ social welfare schemes have been included after working out their financial viability. The unemployment allowance has been modelled on patterns of Congress-served states Punjab and Chhattisgarh,” said former Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken.

The first point of the manifesto was appointing a Lokpal, a promise made by AAP in 2015. “We will appoint a strong Lokpal within six months,” said Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra. A “Yaari Startup Incubation Fund” of Rs 5,000 crore has also been promised to incentivise entrepreneurs.

The manifesto listed payment of Rs 72,000 per year to five lakh poor families, a scheme proposed in LS election by Rahul Gandhi. The document focused on urban renewal and infrastructure development.

The icons also acknowledge climate change with a polar bear, seal and dodo. Food trends such as bubble tea, fondue, flatbread and olives are represented. Other additions include the transgender flag and transgender symbol, as well as more gender-inclusive variations of existing emoji.

The emojis are created by Unicode Consortium, a nonprofit California-based organisation that designs emojis for all Apple and Android devices, though the emojis themselves look different on different platforms. Unicode Consortium’s latest release has been praised on social media as the most progressive yet, particularly with regards to gender. One Twitter user said the new emojis would help give a voice to marginalised communities. “Getting to see yourself... is validation that you are being heard and that your voice matters,” they tweeted. Another added: “Trans rights are human rights”.

The website Emojipedia, which is part of the Unicode Consortium, said in a blog post on January 29: “Announced today by the Unicode Consortium, the 117 new emojis form part of Emoji 13.0 and will come to most platforms in the second half of 2020.Variations of existing emojis now approved for 2020 include a woman or genderinclusive person in a tuxedo, as well as a gender-neutral person or a man in a veil...”

“This addition is part of an ongoing effort to make more consistent set of gender options across the board, and expands upon the 138 new gender-neutral emojis added in late 2019,” it added. However, there’s one new emoji that got some criticism — a pinched fingers emoji, referred to as ‘Italian Hand Gesture.’ A Twitter user posted: “Olives AND pinched fingers? huge progress for maintaining Italian stereotypes.”

217,['3/02/2020'],Measures taken to ensure water supply: Kochi councillors,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Water tankers outside the Maradu water treatment plant.

KOCHI: The corporation has taken measures to ensure supply of water to areas in West Kochi hit by shortages, say councillors.

They said the local body has allocated plan funds for replacing old pipelines. Steps have also been taken to lay pipelines without tilling the surface of new roads.

“Each division has been allocated at least Rs 50,000 for laying pipes. Moreover, applications have been collected through Kudumbashree to help BPL families get house connections, at Rs 3,500 each. House connections are being provided to prevent misuse of public taps,” said Cheralayi’s Shyamala S Prabhu, one of the longest serving councillors of the corporation.

Thampy Subramaniyam, who represents Palluruthy-Kacheripady, said water supply to the region was disrupted for two days recently. Water requirements here are met by the Maradu water treatment plant . “When the number of tankers sourcing water from the hydrants at the plant increased, KWA cut down the supply to West Kochi. Following a public outcry, K J Maxi MLA convened a meeting. It was then decided that water supply to these regions will not be disrupted for providing water to tankers. Since then supply has been restored,” he said.

However, some councillors from West Kochi complained of continued slippage in water supply. “There are areas where supply is very poor. Though the matter has been taken up with KWA, they said that it is because of insufficient water availability,” said Bindhu Levin of Karippalam.

Meanwhile, works standing committee chairperson PM Harris said that there “were not too many complaints from West Kochi” regarding shortage of supply. “As the corporation has taken the effort to replace old pipelines and provide new connections, we were able to address the issue to a great extent,” he said.

220,['3/02/2020'],London Terror Attack: Streatham knifeman Sudesh Amman had relatives in Sri Lanka and was under police surveillance,"This story is from February 3, 2020

A knife-wielding terrorist who was shot dead by police in London on Sunday during a crazed stabbing spree has been named by police as Sudesh Mamoor Faraz Amman , a convicted Islamist terrorist who has extended family in Sri Lanka.

The 20-year-old ISIS and al-Qaeda supporter stabbed two people in south London in broad daylight on a busy high street just before 2pm in what Metropolitan police quickly declared as an “Islamist-related terrorist incident”.

Amman was jailed in December 2018 aged 18 for Islamist-related terrorist offences at the Old Bailey but was released from prison early just days ago. He is thought to have been living in a South London bail hostel when he carried out the attack.

Wearing a fake explosive vest, he stole a £3.99 10-inch kitchen knife from a convenience store and stabbed two people in Streatham High Road, leaving one man, in his 40s, in a life-threatening condition. Plain clothes police officers who had been following him on foot , shot him dead outside Boots pharmacy with handguns, in scenes reminiscent of an action movie, before hordes of armed police arrived.

Next specialist explosives officers and additional armed officers were called into deal with the device around his body which was found to be a hoax suicide vest.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi said “The suspect has not yet been formally identified however, given the circumstance of the incident, we are confident that he was Sudesh Amman , aged 20. Armed officers, who were part of a proactive counter-terrorism surveillance operation and were following the suspect on foot, were in immediate attendance and shot a male suspect dead at the scene. The suspect had been recently released from prison where he had been serving a sentence for Islamist-related terrorism offences.”

Witnesses also spoke of a police car crashing nearby in the rush to get to the scene.

In December 2018 Amman, then an 18-year-old student at North West London College , living in Harrow , had pleaded guilty to 13 counts of possessing and distributing terrorist documents via Skype and was jailed for three years and four months. He had been arrested in May 2018 by armed police.

The Old Bailey heard that he had tried to radicalise his own family, by sharing Al-Qaeda propaganda in a family WhatsApp group, and sharing bomb-making manuals on Skype, exposing his five younger brothers aged 11 to 15, and extended family in Sri Lanka to jihadist material.

After his arrest, police found bomb-making and knife-fighting manuals on his digital devices, as well ISIS videos depicting graphic violence.

In online messages he pledged allegiance to Islamic State, said ""the Islamic State is here to stay"", and said he considered ISIS to “be the best thing to happen to Islam”.

He also spoke about Muslims in London “being massacred” and “put in conditions worse than concentration camps”,and said “the Quran gave permission to rape Yazidi women”.

In a raid of his home, where he lived with his mother and brothers, police officers found a black flag, a combat knife and an air gun.

The court heard he had sent beheadings videos to his girlfriend and advised her to kill her ""Kafir"" (“non-believer”) parents and that he had fantasised about carrying out terror attacks with knives and acid.

The then head of the Met Police counter-terrorism command Acting Commander Alexis Boon said at the time of his conviction: “His fascination with dying in the name of terrorism was clear in a notepad we recovered from his home. Amman had scrawled his ‘life goals’ in the notepad and top of the list, above family activities, was dying a martyr and going to ‘Jannah’ - the afterlife.”

The two victims of Sunday’s attack, a man in his 40s and a woman in her 50s, were rushed to South London hospitals. The man, who witnesses said was stabbed in his stomach, was initially in a life-threatening condition. However by late Sunday night, D'Orsi said “we are thankful that following his treatment at hospital, this is no longer the case. “

A woman in her 50s, who witnesses said was stabbed in the back, had non-life threatening injuries and has now been discharged from hospital. Another woman in her 20s has minor injuries - believed to have been caused by glass shattering following the discharge of the police firearm. She continues to receive treatment at hospital.

NEW DELHI: The railways on Sunday released photographs of bananas being loaded into a refrigerated container for export from a town in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh . A day earlier, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the government’s plan to set up ‘ Kisan Rail ’ through PPP.“For the first time, Guntakal division has loaded bananas for export to West Asian countries in a refrigerated container train from Tadipatri.

MUMBAI: The water crisis continued on Sunday a day after the civic body claimed to have completed repairs to the damaged pipeline and assured regular supply from Sunday.Residents of Juhu Koliwada in Santacruz (west) and Yari Road in Andheri (west) said they had been deprived of water supply on Sunday, while households in parts of Vile Parle said water supply pressure was low.On Sunday, civic officials said the process to fix the problem was “extremely complex” as the pipeline runs 40 ft below the ground and the road there is not levelled.The water crisis in the suburbs started on Thursday evening after a pipeline located about 40ft below Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road was damaged when work on Metro 4 was on.The BMC and the MMRDA, which is the implementing authority of the Metro line, blamed one another for the problem.Three days after the crisis started, underground water storage tanks of some buildings had run dry. While locals made a beeline to buy bottled water, stores selling bottled water had either run out of stock or were allegedly charging more than the marked price.Larson Fernandes, a resident of Juhu Koliwada, said that pockets in his locality had not received water on Sunday — three days after the problem started. “Those staying at the fag end of the koliwada have been worst hit. A few bought bottled water for drinking but shops were charging extra due to high demand,” said Fernandes.A Yari Road resident reiterated this view. “Even supermarkets had no bottled water... But later, we got restricted supply for two hours late Saturday.... My domestic help who lives nearby had no water supply since Thursday.”Corporator Abhijeet Samant from Vile Parle said that buildings with borewells depended on the well water. “But residents of other buildings had no option but to wait for municipal water supply,” said Samant. Bandra corporator Asif Zakeria said regular water supply was restored in his area.A civic official said that the topography of the spot where the pipeline was damaged made repair work challenging. “We had to dig a manhole, 50 metres away from the affected site. Labourers and a junior civic engineer got inside to locate the spot of leakage, while we monitored the situation using a robot camera,” said the official. Those who went underground would signal the source of the leakage so that we could start repair work, added the official. Civic officials said they would consider imposing a penalty on whoever was at fault for the water crisis.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73888355,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-141978,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/water-crisis-still-on-as-bmc-yet-to-restore-normal-supply/articleshow/73888259.cms

Railway police constable carrying Ankit Shukla at Dadar station

MUMBAI: A railway police constable hoisted an unconscious commuter on his shoulders and carried him out of Dadar station to be taken to hospital without waiting for a stretcher on Saturday, saving his life.

Ankit Shukla (25), was on platform 3 at Dadar station around 10.40pm when he felt dizzy. He slipped from the platform and fell onto the tracks. Government Railway Police (GRP) constable Bhadale was patrolling the platform with a colleague. He spotted Shukla on the tracks and jumped down.

Bhadale and two Maharashtra Security Force (MSF) jawans lifted Shukla onto the platform. Bhadale then proceeded to lift Shukla on his shoulders and carried him across the footover bridge, without waiting for a stretcher and hamaal to arrive. He rushed Shukla to Sion Hospital where he was treated by doctors and is now stable. ""Doctors appreciated Bhadale's quick thinking. Shukla's father told Bhadale, 'Aap hamare liye bhagwaan ho' (you are God for us),"" said senior inspector Prasad Pandhre.

In a separate incident in June last year, seven railway policewomen rushed to the aid of an unconscious commuter at Dadar station, carrying her across platforms to a medical room. The policewomen were later rewarded for the act which was captured on cameras. Goregaon resident Nikita Dighe had lost consciousness and fallen off a local train.

The students' organisations have sought vice-chancellor Suhas Pednekar's resignation for allowing such a body, with no expertise in education laws and administrative work to conduct the camp.The residential camp was organised at RMP's campus in Uttan village in Bhayander for 30 university officers who are at assistant registrar or equivalent level. After the first session on Saturday - at around 11.30 am - the university officials were told that the rest of the programme was called off due to technical reasons and they were asked to go home. ""There was opposition from senate members, but we do not know why it was cancelled midway,"" said an officer attending the session.Congress leader Rajeev Satav brought the matter to the notice of higher and technical education minister Uday Samant. Satav also tweeted against the misuse of public funds to benefit RSS-affiliated body in the name of training, said a statement released by Congress' student wing, NSUI. While Samant did not release any statement officially, a letter was sent to his office by university authorities informing him about the cancellation of the programme.NSUI demanded an inquiry into the matter as well as Pednekar's resignation. ""It is true that RSS-affiliated organisations and its members have been illegally appointed in various universities during the BJP government. NSUI even opposed the illegal appointment of director Yogesh Soman in one of the university's academies. The organisation will keep fighting against the saffronisation of the university,"" said NSUI national secretary Nikhil Kamble.Pradeep Sawant, senate member from Yuva sena, also opposed the move and questioned how the organisation is qualified to train university officials in administrative work. ""We have an auditorium in Kalina, there was no need to spend money and take the officers to Uttan. Also, there was no logic in training our officers under a politically-affiliated body,"" said Sawant, adding that they have also demanded the VC's resignation.A university official said that the decision to train officers at RMP was taken earlier. ""After adjusting their schedule and availability the dates were finalised. It was, however, called off due to technical reasons,"" said the official, without specifying why the organisation was selected for the training camp.The workshop was expected to train and guide the university officials in administrative work.

KOLKATA: Not just people on college campuses and the streets, even brides and grooms have joined the battle against NRC and CAA , turning wedding venues into protest sites. On Sunday, one such couple — Sayantani Khan and Muntakem Haque — tied the knot at a South Kolkata community hall, where they posed for pictures holding placard saying, “NO NRC, NO NPR, NO CAA”.Borrowing the idea from the weddings in Kerala, the duo decided to highlight the anti-CAA protests and make an effort to make their guests aware of the issue. “People are protesting against this act in various ways. So we thought of this idea where we can spread awareness among a good number of people about the protests against NRC and CAA. Moreover, wedding pictures are often shared, and liked, on social media. So a protest and an awareness campaign would make it count even more,” Khan said.Their act took their relatives and friends by surprise, but everyone participated in the protest. The couple got an overwhelming response from friends and relatives with everyone posing for photographs with the placard.Both Khan and Haque are independent film-makers and met each other six years ago. They bonded over work, films, social issues and became friends, which later turned into a love affair. Religion was never an issue when they decided to get married and received immense support from their families. “We are lucky that we did not have to face any problems. However, there was some pressure, created by this discriminatory act, that we could feel whenever we went to speak to caterers, decorators and marriage registrars,” Khan said.“NPR, NRC, CAA are discriminatory and are against the secular tenets of our Constitution. The government is trying to create a chasm between communities through these. Through our actions, we want to uphold the ethos of our country and send out a message that religion should not be used to divide people,” Haque said.The couple’s friend Dwaipayan Banerjee felt it was a positive sign that the protest against CAA, NRC and NPR was not restricted to the streets and educational campuses, and has been accepted at social occasions that involve a mixed crowd.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73888342,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-696991,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-no-caa-replaces-i-do-for-fighter-couple/articleshow/73888330.cms

""Congress got 15 years, AAP got five, so please give five years to BJP now and see how it changes the city. In Delhi, they only talk about freebies, but have not brought about any real development. For many years, 40 lakh people lived in unauthorised colonies in Delhi. But they have been regularised by the Centre,"" he said.

The party, which has a pre-poll pact with BJP, has fielded Shailendra Kumar in Burari. Kumar said: ""Earlier, people used to say that there was jungle rule in Bihar. However, after the formation of NDA government, there is development with justice, every village has been connected with a paved road, there is a proper system of education and health. If a poor state can do so much work, why not the country's capital?""

Kumar claimed his government wanted to start an interstate bus service for the Poorvanchali people, but was denied permission by Delhi government. “A lot of people from Bihar are in Delhi for whom we wanted to start a bus service, but we were not given permission. We have a bus linking Patna to Ghaziabad, but not directly to Delhi,” he said.

On Arvind Kejriwal’s comment in September about people from Bihar coming to Delhi for medical treatment, Kumar said: “The chief minister of Delhi says the people of Bihar come to the capital with a ticket of Rs 500 and get treatment of Rs 5 lakh for free. What a lie! They don’t spend on patients. The Centre spends money through Ayushman Bharat… And do the people have to take Kejriwal’s permission to come to Delhi?” he said.

Shah said Kejriwal had left no stone unturned in disrespecting Poorvanchalis. “You have got Rs 5 lakh from your home? Why disrespect them? I want to tell you, my Poorvanchali brothers and sisters, that you have the same rights here as you do in UP and Bihar,” he said. Shah said like Sabarmati riverfront, the banks of Yamuna will be developed when BJP wins the election.

Picture used for representational purpose only

CHENNAI: Three people were arrested on Saturday for smuggling methamphetamine that they had packed in small sachets for sale in Thiruvottiyur .

The accused were identified as A Mohammed Azharuddin, 26, of Mannady, M Khadar Moideen, 27, of Royapuram, and R Rajesh, 23, a resident of Old Washermenpet.

Police seized 26 grams of methamphetamine - a psychotropic drug - and 1.5kg of ganja . Besides the contraband, a car, two bikes and three mobile phones were seized from the peddlers.

The Thiruvottiyur police had nabbed Khader on the Ennore Express Road and based on his confession, police arrested Azharuddin and Rajesh from a hideout. Investigation revealed that the three collected the contraband from a man named Sultan from Avadi. Police said Sultan smuggled in drugs from Mumbai.

Azharuddin and Khader have been arrested for similar offences by the city police earlier. ""Azharuddin said that he sells used cars for a living, but we suspect that he is into smuggling full-time,"" said an investigating officer.

Police said the men sold methamphetamine for Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 per gram to college students. The three were produced before a magistrate who sent them to judicial custody. A hunt has been launched for Sultan. Police are also trying to locate the origin of the contraband.

Recently, police apprehended a few people for buying methamphetamine online and from couriers from other parts of the city and abroad.

237,['3/02/2020'],Bengaluru: Ejipura-Koramangala flyover may not meet April deadline,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Land acquisition issues have dogged the 2.4km flyover project, which was to be completed by April this year

BENGALURU: The Ejipura-Koramangala flyover , slated to decongest traffic on the 100ft Intermediate Ring Road stretch between Ejipura Main Road-Inner Ring Road Junction and Hosur Road junction near Kendriya Sadan, is set to miss its first deadline — April. And, given the pace at which hurdles to the construction are being removed, the second deadline — June — is expected to be missed too.

With 49 properties yet to be acquired, the 2.4km flyover has 67 of its 81 piers in place. Work order for the flyover was issued in May 2017, but traffic cops took their time giving clearance, delaying work by five months. When police permission was finally granted on October 6, 2017, pier-testing work took two months.

“Civil police again took over 270 days to give permission for controlled blasting, which further delayed the project,” said a senior BBMP official.

“The project seems to be a never-ending one. The civic body doesn’t seem interested in completing the work,” rued Vijay RM, an employee with Embassy Golf Links in Domlur.

Vijay, a resident of Bannerghatta Road, drives to office every day and complained about the traffic congestion. “I spend nearly four hours navigating traffic and bad roads,” he said.

BBMP is yet to acquire 8,000 sqft of land for the flyover. “We need 49 properties, including 5000 sqft area of St John’s Hospital, another property that belongs to the central public works department and 948 sqft of land in the Indian Institute of Astrophysics campus,” a BBMP official said. A 2.5-metre-wide footpath is to come up in these acquired properties.

“We have to come up with a solution and as St John’s has agreed for TDR, we have sent the files and are waiting for approval. But another 1,630 sqft of property belonging to a private individual will have to be acquired by paying a compensation of Rs 9,300 per sqmt,” the official said, adding, “The contractor has been informed to complete all the work, including capping, construction of piers and asphalting.”

Confirming that 67 out 81 piers have been already erected, BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar said, “We need to build portal structures near St John’s and that will be done soon. The project should be completely operational by mid-2020.”

Koramangala corporator M Chandrappa, however, said erecting 90-foot-tall piers involves a lot of work. “There are safety issues too. Precision is the key if the structure has to be safe,” he added.

RAIPUR: Braving Maoists threat , villagers from Dharmapenta, one of the worst Naxaite-hit areas, in Sukma district of Chhattisgarh gathered at an election rally for panchayat polls on Sunday - the first time in about three decades. The villagers resolved to exercise their franchise in the poll scheduled to be held on Monday.

Police said people of Naxalite-affected areas have now gained trust in democracy and police as the terror of Maoists is vanishing. Presence of more than 300 villagers in election assembly is a positive sign for democracy and an indication of Naxalites getting uprooted, said police.

""Dharmpenta was a village, where Naxalites used to terrorise people ... to keep them away from election assemblies and voting. But, with presence of police force, this year a significant positive change was noticed in the scenario during elections,"" he added.

In the extremely sensitive polling booth at Surnar, 12 Maoists carrying reward on their head, including DAKMS head, surrendered to the police and joined the mainstream. They also exercised their voting rights in Bijapur district on January 30.

MELBOURNE: Novak Djokovic 's face was a collage of emotion - triumph and defiance. After four hours at the Rod Laver Arena , when he took on a spirited Dominic Thiem and a full house, most of whom backed his opponent, the Serb's hands went up in celebration. It was a record eighth Australian Open title. And more.Djokovic won 6-4, 4-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 to claim his 17th Major crown, which made him the first man in the Open Era to win Grand Slams in three different decades, having won his first title here 12 years ago.The victory on Sunday saw Djokovic inch closer to Roger Federer 's record haul of 20 Grand Slams, a number he's gunning for. The Serb, who takes home the winner's cheque of A$4,120,000, will also return to the top spot in the ATP rankings.""This is my favourite court, my favourite stadium. I'm blessed to be holding this trophy once again,"" said Djokovic, who sported a jersey initialed 'KB' in memory of his mentor and friend, the legendary Kobe Bryant .Thiem, who battled to the finish in his third Grand Slam final, collected a cheque of A$2,065,000. ""Amazing achievement, Novak,"" he told the winner.When Thiem won his first point of the match at 30-15 in the opening game, the shout from the stands was loud and decisive. No question of who the deep-throated cheers were reserved for. And when the 26-year-old sent a tame backhand into the net in his first service game, after going up 40-15, a loud moan echoed through the grounds. Shouts of 'Come on, Nole' were stray and for most part coming from a section of the upper bowl where Serbian fans sat. The Austrian got on the scoreboard after 18 minutes, when he beat the 32-year-old at his own game, using the geometry of the court.Against Djokovic, who is per force aided by courts that have slowed down significantly in recent years, holding serve was going to be a tough proposition. Thiem broke in the seventh game, at 15, a thunderous forehand beating the world No. 2. Serving to stay in the set, at 4-5, the powerhouse fell behind 0-30, and after 48 minutes of action, Djokovic had a set point, which Thiem saved, then gave himself a chance to hold, but finally double-faulted the set away. Every season in a game, something like the Melbourne weather.Thiem went ahead when he broke in the third game of the second set. Djokovic came back, following a gritty hold in the seventh to break serve and level in the eighth game. He reopened the counter that a break of serve counts for very little against the man whose rapier-like returns has cut the best of serves to shreds.There was a curve ahead, but it came with no warning. In the ninth, the Serb threw in a double and sent a backhand into the net to fall back 15-40 in a game in which he got two time violations, leading to a loss of serve. The second seed was forced to serve a second serve at 15-40.At the changeover, Djokovic patted chair umpire Damien Dumusois on his feet, giving him a thumbs-up. He followed it up with a verbal jibe. Thiem then held serve to level at a set apiece.Djokovic walked off the court at the end of the set to gather himself more than for a change of shirt. The Serb then lost two service games and was down 0-4. When the second seed held serve in the fifth game, he punctuated a seven-game losing streak. Djokovic was the fresher player, but appeared to be in trouble.

KOCHI: The ‘Ente Kulam’ project awaits more support from the district administration.

As a drought-mitigation programme, it is one of the most successful large-scale water conservation initiatives undertaken in Ernakulam . “However, there hasn’t been much activity since June 2019. The project was implemented with the CSR funds of various organizations. Within a span of three years, we could revive 355 ponds in the district,” said Anup Chandran, a representative of Anbodu Kochi, an NGO actively involved in project implementation.

The initiative began in 2016 with the district administration tying up with Anbodu Kochi to revive the ponds that were drying up for want of proper attention. He said the initiative depends on funding as there is a requirement for generators, pump sets, tipper lorries, excavators and cleaning workers. “It was the district administration that brought in the funds required for implementing the project. The volunteers alone cannot take the project forward,” he added. The responsibility of maintaining the revived ponds and waterbodies was given to the local bodies, including municipalities and panchayats.

Monitored directly by the district administration, the project was implemented under the Haritha Keralam Mission through local self-government bodies, Anbodu Kochi, NSS technical cell, water resources department, Suchitwa Mission, Nehru Yuva Kendra and Kudumbashree.

Ernakulam district grabbed the second position among the south Indian states in the central government’s National Water Award 2018 for rehabilitation and revival of water resources.

Sujith Karun of Haritha Keralam said that though they have not taken up any new work since June 2019, it has been decided to go ahead with the plan of upgrading six ponds that have already been revived. “The district collector has approved it. One of the selected ponds falls within Tripunithura municipal area. The collector has permitted the municipality to go ahead with its plans to implement further conservation and rejuvenation plans for this waterbody,” Karun said.

Chhatradhar with his family

LALGARH (JHARGRAM): A day after his release, Chhatradhar Mahato - who rallied to Lalgarh with people mostly associated with Trinamool Congress on Sunday after completing a 10-year sentence - was all praise for chief minister Mamata Banerjee for her development work in the area.

Though Mahato was non-committal about joining any party, TMC made it clear it is ready to accept the pro-Maoist leader, allowing a new political equation in Jangalmahal that could thwart BJP's recent upsurge in the region.

""I cannot express my feelings in words. I was cut off from the world for 10 years, but I always had a belief that I would get freedom one day,"" Mahato said. Asked whether he would join TMC, the former PCPA (People's Committee against Police Atrocities) leader said: ""I cannot tell right now. Once I was in Trinamool, but after that I was working under a separate banner. Now, I am cut off from the party. I want to work for the people but before that I want to spend some days with my family.""

TMC, however, is ready to accept Mahato. TMC Jhargram district president Birbaha Soren told TOI: ""Chhatradhar has always worked for the people and so he is always welcome in the party. His inclusion will enrich the party.""

Mahato, who reached Lodhashuli at 1.20pm, rallied to Lalgarh with more than 1,000 people around 3pm. He was received by wife Niyati, mother Bedanabala and sons Dhriti and Debi Prasad.

Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike

BENGALURU: The land acquisition hurdle in executing the much-delayed Old Madras Road signal-free corridor is finally set to be cleared. Thirty-five landowners will get compensation of Rs 24 crore for properties that will be acquired for the corridor, a senior official from BBMP ’s land acquisition price negotiation committee said.

The 17.5-km corridor stretches from Thirumalashettyhalli to ITPB Main Road, passing through Hope Farm, Big Bazaar and Hoodi junctions, and is expected to end the nightmarish crawl faced by commuters headed to and from Whitefield. It was envisaged under the comprehensive city development plan 2012-2013 and the work order was issued in 2014. However, compensation-related land acquisition problems hindered its implementation. The project cost, too, shot up from Rs 117 crore to Rs 150 crore in 2017.

The project comprises construction of a four-lane flyover at Hoodi Junction, one-way underpass at Big Bazaar and a four-lane underpass at Hope Farm, requiring acquisition of 35, 5 and 10 properties, respectively.

“Initially, property owners were not happy with BBMP’s compensation offer as they compared it to the rates being offered by Namma Metro to land losers in the area,” a Palike official said. Also, BBMP first proposed to hand over transfer of development rights to land losers but shelved the idea three years ago. “Acquiring land under the Land Acquisition Act, 2013 was getting delayed. Hence, we decided to invoke Section 175 of Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act, 1976, which empowers the commissioner to purchase land at unilaterally fixed prices,” the official said.

“We also looked into disparities in compensation under various models and provided landowners various options,” said Ravikumar Suprur, special engineer, major projects. The agency finally decided to go with the Metro model for the compensation package.

According to the revised package, 35 property owners will receive compensation at Rs 15,000 per sqft and the value of any building standing on them after taking into account their depreciation. In all, for 13 properties on one side of the corridor, they will get Rs 12.8 crore, and for 22 properties on the other side, Rs 11.5 crore.

The relief being offered is higher than that being given by Namma Metro, BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar said. He said all land losers had agreed to BBMP’s compensation offer.

Interaction with local community and traders near Nakhoda mosque

KOLKATA: Final year students from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Architecture de Paris La Villette (ENSA-PLV) are in Kolkata to learn about urban values and politics that influence a city’s heritage. Fourteen students from the biggest architecture school in the French capital have been walking the streets of Chitpore for a fortnight now, documenting not just the built architecture in isolation but how it has been moulded and continues to be shaped by the myriad trade that is carried out along this heritage corridor.Also part of this ‘Learning from Indian Cities’ documentation initiative are 34 students from Bharati Vidyapeeth College of Architcture, Navi Mumbai (BVCOA); and 12 students from College of Architecture Trivandrum (CAT).After spending another week studying and interpreting one of the oldest stretches in the city, the students from ENSAPLV will return to Paris and work on design interventions and implementable ideas to be presented at the end of their semester in July.“Architecture students need aview of society. In Paris, and several other European cities, there are strict urban rules in place. While this helps preserve the built heritage, there is no scope of learning about urban values. An architect needs to imagine a project not just from the technical point of view but social and political as well. That is not possible in Paris. Kolkata, Chitpore in particular, is the perfect classroom to offer students an insight into how a living heritage precinct is kept alive by the throb of life and gets reshaped by the demands of livelihood and urbanisation,” said Claudio Secci, the ENSA-PLV faculty accompanying the students.Over the past fortnight, the 60 students from the three institutes have scoured the Chitpore neighbourhood between Tiretta Bazaar and Kumartuli and interacted with people who live and work there to take note of the diverse trades that are carried out and the architecture and urbanisation that is derived from the various occupations.Heritage India Synergies founder and conservation architect Kamalika Bose, who is assisting the programme as a local resource person, said the students have since mid-January spent nearly 10 hours daily on the streets of Chitpore, starting with multicultural neighbourhoods of Tiretta Bazaar and Ezra Street where foreign migrant communities inhabited to Colootola and Burtolla, Burrabazar, Pathuriaghata, Beniatola and finally Kumartuli.She cited an example of how the condition of building types in two localities where the profession had been the same reflected the changes that had occurred in the economy, community and the trade.“Bengali goldsmith families that work in Garanhata Street in Beniatola live in low-rise townhouses above. Some owners resided there but upper floors were largely tenanted. Most of the buildings are in dilapidated condition, a reflection also of the decline in trade and lack of real estate pressure on land there. In the shops situated on the ground floor, many workers now make imitation jewellery. In contrast, the non-Bengali jewellers community in Burtolla Street in Burrabazar still reside in the buildings above the workshops. However, they employ skilled Bengali goldsmiths and have also diversified from gold to diamond and gem stones. Many houses have converted into profitable jewellery malls,” Bose said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73889079,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-615817,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/architecture-students-from-france-roam-streets-of-chitpore-to-learn-urban-values/articleshow/73887892.cms

NEW DELHI: After Congress released its manifesto, which promised 300 units of electricity and 20,000 litres water free every month, Aam Aadmi (AAP) Party MP Sanjay Singh dared the grand old party to make even 30 units of electricity free in Congress-governed states.

""Tall talks will not serve any purpose. Congress should explain the electricity tariff in Congress-governed states,"" Singh claimed. The AAP leader said that during its 15 years of governance in Delhi, frequent hikes were witnessed in electricity tariff. ""No one will believe Congress's promise,"" he added.

At a press conference later in the day, AAP's Rajinder Nagar candidate Raghav Chadha said that chief ministers of BJP-governed states were facing tough questions from the public during campaigning about electricity tariff in their states.

Rupani responded that the cost was around Rs 600, to which the man responded that in Delhi, the amount is zero,"" Chadha said.

During a public meeting, Chadha said, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar was questioned about the frequency of electricity supply. ""Initially, CM Khattar refused to respond, but when the woman insisted, he said that it was around 6-8 hours a day.

BENGALURU: In an effort to increase compliance in payment of goods and services tax , the Centre has initiated corrective measures to improve the GST Network (GSTN) web portal.

Technical glitches on GSTN, through which tax is paid and and returns filed, were cited for poor compliance. Ever since it was rolled out over two years ago, despite initiatives such as setting up a group of ministers, the problems have persisted.

The Union revenue department has organised brainstorming sessions with GSTN’s lead service provider Infosys. “It was a long-pending demand that the Centre should intervene directly and it has finally happened, though a little late,” said BT Manohar, member, GST advisory council, Karnataka government. “It has raised hopes of resources mobilisation for Karnataka.”

Once the glitches are fixed, compliance in Karnataka could be higher than in Maharashtra, which tops GST collection in the country.

“We took stock of all issues related to performance of the portal,” said Anil Kumar Jha, additional revenue secretary, finance ministry, central government.

MUMBAI: Four people were rounded up for questioning by Kurar police in connection with the shooting incidents that took place at two Malad (east) shops on Saturday. The shootings were reportedly directed by Uday Pathak, who is lodged in prison for quadruple murders in 2011. The owner of one of the two shops had been targetted for extortion in 2015 as well, at Pathak's behest.

Around 1.30pm on Saturday, a masked man walked into a medical store at Shivaji Nagar and fired a shot, shattering a glass cabinet. A shard pierced one of the employee's hands. The shooter was on foot, but it is believed that his associates were waiting on a bike some distance away. Shortly afterwards, the same shooter fired a round at Rokadia Traders. Nobody was hurt.

Sunil Singh, the owner of the medical store, said: ""This is the second time we have been targetted. In 2015, shooters had fired a round at an under-construction site in Shivaji Nagar, injuring a contractor in the abdomen. A chit flung at the site mentioned the names of four targets, which included ours."" Three people were arrested in the case and released on bail. Singh believes that by including his name in the list, Pathak may have wanted to instil fear among small business owners in the area and extort money.

Pathak was booked for murder and attempt to commit murder. He was externed from city limits more than 10 years ago.

BENGALURU: More than a month after Harish Bangera, 32, was arrested in Saudi Arabia over alleged hate posts on social media, ministry of external affairs officials said they have sent several requests but authorities in the Gulf nation have not responded to even a single query. Bangera, a resident of Goyadibettu in Bijadi village of Kundapur taluk, Udupi district, was an air-conditioning technician for a company in Dammam, capital of Saudi's eastern provice.

He was arrested on December 20, 2019 for allegedly posting derogatory messages on Facebook against Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammad bin Salman and a community.

Sources in MEA told TOI, ""We've made many efforts to contact the Saudi authorities but they haven't responded. It is the right of every individual to at least have communication with a counsellor, but the Saudi authorities have neither allowed nor communicated anything in this regard.""

Bangera's wife Sumana M, who lives in Udupi, said a fake Facebook account was the cause of the problem. Udupi police said they have contacted the US-based company but is yet to get a response.

According to sources, Indians, especially people from Bangera's hometown, would visit him in prison and were in touch with the authorities, but Saudi police warned them not to meet him in jail as it's a serious offence.

Harish's roommate, a Pakistani, is also believed to have tried his best to get him out of prison, they added.

'Cannot console my daughter'

Sumana said her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter wants to talk to her father. ""Harish would call us at least three-four times every day. He'd talk to her on a video call and she hasn't seen or spoken to him for over a month. I'm unable to make her understand what has happened to him,"" she said. Sumana has been told the Saudi authorities could take three more months to complete the inquiry.

Sumana has told the Cyber Economic and Narcotics (CEN) police in Udupi that her husband is paying the price for hate posts on a fake Facebook account created in his name. However, police are still unclear whether it was a fake account as in the same ID, there was a video apologising for the hate remarks.

Kochi Metro train (File Photo)

KOCHI: Private bus operators in the city say that bus owners are being forced to stop operations of around 300 buses in the past one year in Ernakulam district .

Kochi metropolitan transport cooperative society president T J Raju said that after Kochi Metro began operations between Aluva and Thykoodam, about 35% of bus commuters have migrated to the Metro.

""While passengers who pay full ticket fares migrate to Metro, students who travel with concession travel by buses. If more private bus operators stop services, it will worsen the travel woes of students,"" he said.

Increased fuel expenses, spare parts cost, wages of crew and taxes have resulted in huge operational cost. ""Bus operators are trying to convert to CNG-operated buses as part of their effort to survive in the industry. It will help us reduce fuel expenses and also bring down pollution in the city,"" added Raju.

According to private bus owners, it will be difficult for them to introduce air-conditioned buses or low-floor buses without the government increasing ticket fares. ""The minimum fare is Rs 8 (for 5km). When KSRTC operates AC buses, they can charge higher rates, but private operators are not allowed to increase the rates,"" he added.

Meanwhile, Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) has signed an agreement with Kerala State Road Transport Corporation for plying electric buses as part of its feeder service to Cochin International Airport Ltd (Cial). The plan is to introduce two electric buses. Electric buses having a seating capacity of 32 will conduct services from Aluva Metro station to Cial as well as in other feasible routes.

While addressing a press conference here on Sunday, the CM said that the entire project will be spread over 148.17 km and will also be a connecting point to the Kempegowda International Airport ().Like the Namma Metro, he said that the suburban trains will be in service from 5 am to midnight and run at a maximum speed of 90 kmph.However, the bigger challenge for the project is land acquisition and funding. As per the Rail India Technical and Economic Service report, the total land required for the project is 583 acres. It also stated that the cost of land acquisition has to be borne entirely by the state government. However, the CM claimed that only 103 acres needs to be acquired for the project as the rest belongs to either the Railways or the state government. He said that the Railways and government land will be leased at a nominal cost of Re 1 per acre. The current cost of the project is pegged at Rs 15,990 crore but it is estimated that it may go up to Rs 18,621 crore.The train corridors are spread from Kengeri to Whitefield, KSRCity Railway Station to Devanahalli (via Yeshwanthpur), Chikkabanavara to Baiyyappanahalli and Heelalige to Rajanukunte. There will be a total of 57 stations.The CM also said that the trains would have air-conditioned coaches. “There will be many junctions where the suburban trains will have common/adjacent stations with the Railways and Metro. As many as 23 stations will have connections with suburban trains and Railways; five stations will connect one suburban corridor to another and 11 Metro stations will have connections with suburban trains.

Noise Pollution

Resto-bars get notice to shut loudoutdoors and indoors by deadline; they demand rule relaxation at least on weekendsEven as Mumbai readies to embrace its tag of ‘City that never sleeps’, by moving towards extending hours for nightlife,is continuing to face a crackdown on its popular party districts.Close on the heels of, it is now the turn of restaurants andinto be told by police to shut down music at 10 pm — not just outdoors, but also indoors — in order to curb noise levels going up in a residential area.On January 31,officials shot off a notice to all restaurants and bars under its jurisdiction, and also attended a meeting with their representatives on the same day. Cops ordered this zone’s establishment owners to ensure that no loud music is played anywhere on their premises after the 10 pm cutoff, complying with the existing(Regulation and Control) Rules.Reacting to this, the restaurant and bar owners have criticised the early deadline, further demanding that music be allowed to play till a later hour at least on weekends. The owners also argued that the norms should be applicable to outdoor or rooftop restaurants, not indoor ones.Worries about losing customers seem to already be making waves. Sandip Agrawal, founder and managing director of the Thikana Group and The Tenth Floor restopub, said, “When we were told at Friday’s meeting on noise levels to shut loud music by 10 pm, we complied right away. But, we collectively agreed that it should be applicable for outdoor restaurants. Plus, a relaxation of the rule should be discussed at least for weekends. This deadline is just too early. Many of our customers come especially to enjoy the music and atmosphere. Baner is an area where youngsters revel in the nightlife. If music is off at 10 pm, we wonder if customers will even wait thereafter.”Expressing helplessness, Effingut Brewerkz owner Manu Gulati shared on Sunday, “When we were told restrictions have been put in place on noise levels, we immediately followed the norm and started shutting music after 10 pm. While indoor music should be allowed to stay on for more time, police are cracking down on that, too. We have to abide by the law.”A few restaurant owners also said they are still to get any such written order — but most such establishments in the area have had the new rule communicated to them at least verbally. Another such owner on Baner Road told Mirror on condition of anonymity, “We have received no such notice, but messages on the shutdown were circulated by police verbally, and we are being made to follow them.This is all similar to the KP drive. We can understand concerns if the music causes problems to residents — but a blanket ban is also unacceptable. Also, in both KP and Baner, the ban on indoor music is not justified at all.”Since Friday, several customers who headed to Baner for their weekend parties have returned an unhappy lot. Heated discussions were also floating on social media about how the very purpose of nightlife is defeated if music is banned even indoors so early in the evening. One such customer, Amit Shinde, told Mirror, “I am regular to many of the restaurants on Baner Road. This new deadline is not something many like me are happy with. At least weekends should be shown more laxity!”Deaf to these pleas, senior police inspector Anil Shewale of Chaturshringi police station said, “We have issued these orders to restaurants and we are making rounds to ensure the norms are followed.” Similarly, commissioner of police (CP) K Venkatesham merely clarified, “We are following noise pollution rules of the government which are applicable to everyone and should be followed. Notices were sent out on this basis.”Now, many residents appear to be a happy lot. Vaishali Patkar, a citizen activist who stays in Baner, said, “It has been five years that we are complaining about loud music in restaurants here, but in vain.

While digging to tap rainwater, workers found 8 ancient idols and 2 grinding stones

MUMBAI: Excavation workers digging a barren land to tap rainwater in Saphale, Palghar district , stumbled upon five ancient bronze sculptures and two grinding stones on Thursday. The forest department was carrying out excavation at Chari-Lalthane village, around 7km from Saphale station, when the workers found the sculptures around 3ft below the ground.

The digging was halted and forest officials reached the spot to take custody of the sculptures. Saphale range forest officer Ruchita Sankhe said the sculptures and stones would be handed over to the State Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Further digging has been suspended, and an ASI team is expected to visit the site soon.

The idols are each 8 inches tall, and the stones weigh around 35kg each. The idols have been kept with the gram panchayat. Locals believe the history of the sculptures could be traced to Tandulwadi fort, located near the village. As news of the sculptures spread, residents from surrounding villages flocked to the spot. While the history of the findings has yet to be traced, a few locals have began to worship the idols.

All decked up in sparkling outfits, the glow on their faces just added to their beauty. But it wasn’t any other fashion show. As the host put it, it wasn’t the cancer survivors, but women of substance who put their best foot forward at ‘Fabulous Forever’. And we completely agree, as these women have not just fought and won their own battles with breast cancer, but continue to motivate people through their inspiring stories. Here are a few…Principal, College of Physiotherapy, IKDRCIt is recommended to undergo regular check-ups after 50. I came to know about my cancer on undergoing one such check-up in 2017. But my doctor explained and counselled so well that I remained positive all throughout the process. Family support is another thing that helps. Besides, my lymphatic system got disturbed too, which is a very important part of our body. Physiotherapy helped cope with it. Today, I spread awareness about the importance of physiotherapy in post-treatment care. It helps in bringing life to normalcy.Senior assistantI could not believe my doctor when they told me I was suffering from cancer. After all, I was fit as a fiddle! I used to teach yoga and had done 50 Surya Namaskars on the day of my check-up. With the help of my family and doctors, I didn’t just accept the illness, but also overcame it. My son encouraged me to even run a marathon. I started training just after my radiation sessions got over and run a marathon once completely treated. Today, I practise yoga and run marathon. It is like I have got a new meaning to my life, of serving a greater purpose and of inspiring people.Studio managerI was in the US, when one day, my breast started paining. I thought it was a result of gymming, but I went for tests which revealed I had breast cancer. I was diagnosed in March 2018 and was cleared in March 2019. It is in times of strife that you realise who your true well-wishers are. The journey is not as tough as it seems. I remember my son telling me to treat it as if it was a bout of jaundice, which also required six months to heal, so does cancer. So, I treated it like any other disease, fought and emerged victorious.Cancer coachToday (Sunday) is a special day for me as I became cancer-free on this day five years ago. My family had a history of the disease, so I underwent regular check-ups and my cancer was detected during one. Since my husband was in the US, I was at the doctor’s all by myself. Even my doctors were surprised by the composure I had maintained when the news was broken to me. I don’t know where I got the strength to overcome it, I just remember closing my eyes and telling myself that I have to push through it. Later, I even decided my look after going bald, donning long earrings and heavy makeup. I even started learning sugam sangeet, something which I always wanted to do.

Market benchmark sensex dropped over 150 points in morning session on Monday as investor sentiment took a beat... Read More

MUMBAI: Market benchmark sensex dropped over 150 points in morning session on Monday as investor sentiment took a beating after the Union Budget failed to meet expectations.

After swinging over 300 points in early session, the 30-share BSE index was trading 125.45 points or 0.32 per cent lower at 39,610.08, and the broader NSE slipped 21.30 points, or 0.18 per cent, to 11,640.55.

In the previous session, sensex logged its biggest single-day plunge in more than a decade on Saturday after the Union Budget failed to live up to market expectations of growth-boosting measures and fiscal discipline.

Sensex settled 987.96 points or 2.43 per cent lower at 39,735.53, and Nifty plunged 300.25 points or 2.51 per cent to close at 11,661.85.

Meanwhile, on a net basis, foreign institutional investors sold equities worth Rs 1,199.53 crore, while domestic institutional investors purchased shares worth Rs 36.64 crore on Saturday, data available with stock exchanges showed.

ITC, Hero Motocorp, M&M, Tata Steel, HDFC Bank and ONGC were among the top laggards, while Asian Paints, IndusInd Bank, Nestle India, HUL and Bharti Airtel were trading with gains.

According to analysts, the market is disappointed as the budget lacked any significant measure to stimulate demand and did not provide any relief on capital gains tax as expected from budget.

Presenting the Union Budget for 2020-21 in Parliament, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman pegged the fiscal deficit at 3.8 per cent for the current fiscal, compared to the earlier target of 3.3 per cent of GDP.

She also proposed lower income tax slabs for those foregoing various exemptions, and removed dividend distribution tax on companies, effectively shifting the tax burden to the recipients.

Further, volatility in the market also heightened after Chinese stocks opened after an extended break, traders said.

Bourses in Shanghai plummeted over 8 per cent, Japan and South Korea were trading with significant losses, while Hong Kong was up.

Brent crude oil futures fell 0.69 per cent to $56.23 per barrel.

The rupee depreciated 26 paise to 71.58 against the US dollar in morning session.

According to the complainant, Sharma got in touch with him a year ago and was asked to invest in a colony called Shri Krishna Vihar being developed at Jaichandpura on city outskirts.

Chitrakoot SHO Virendra Kumar said, ""Sharma told the complainant about the new residential colony and they agreed to buy a 1,500 square yard plot at the rate of Rs 2,000 per square yard. He took the money from the complainant and in return gave 16 fake lease deeds, side plan and receipt.""

However, the agriculture and revenue department authorities and the Locust Control Organisation (LCO) were relieved as a very minimal presence of locusts was confined to Sriganganagar district only, out of the 10 other affected districts. The fresh attack has came as a major setback to their locust control programme.

Rajasthan started witnessing the locust attacks since May 2019 and after a minor gap in September, locust swarms were witnessed in western Rajasthan especially the border districts including Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh, Bikaner, Nagaur, Jodhpur, Churu, Barmer and Jaisalmer and others including Jalore and Sirohi. According to a government estimate, crops on 3.65 lakh hectare of land were damaged till January, while the farmers' union claimed in Rajasthan, around 7.17 lakh hectare of land has seen crop damage.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot had already told the district collectors in the affected districts to complete the crop damage assessment and distribute the compensation. In a symbolic protest, BJP MLA Bihari Lal Nokha in Rajasthan had recently entered the state assembly carrying a basket full of locusts to draw the government's attention to the farmers affected by the menace. ""On Sunday, we were informed about the fresh swarms of locusts which were witnessed at many villages in Srikaranpur tehsil of Sriganganagar district.

""When we had spoken to their authorities they had maintained that they have fully contained them (locusts), however Pakistan declared it as national emergency,"" said Gurjar.

Authorities in the agriculture and revenue department who have already completed the task of Girdawari (crop assessment), also received a setback as fresh locust swarms were witnessed on Sunday.

Representative image

MUMBAI: A businessman from Vikhroli has been arrested by the crime branch for allegedly abetting gangster Prasad Pujari by passing on contact details of a builder whom the gangster called up and threatened. Sunil Narayan Aagane (55) was arrested on Saturday.

Aagane allegedly tried to play intermediary by meeting the builder and trying to facilitate a phone chat between the builder and gangster, the police said.

Last week, two police informers — Salim Penwala alias Maharaj and Faiyyaz Ibrahim Sannata — were arrested for allegedly passing on a builder’s phone numbers to gangster Ejaz Lakdawala.

In the latest case, the developer had taken up a housing redevelopment project in Vikhroli. Soon after his company demolished the old building last June, he started receiving calls from an international cellphone number and the caller demanded Rs 1 crore.

A police source said that the builder told the caller that he would not be able to pay up as much, claiming that redevelopment projects do not rake in too much money and also said that business had been bad in recent times. “At this, the gangster said that the builder should pay the amount before he started work the project,” said the source.

Subsequent calls from the international number were not answered by the builder, said the source, spurring Aagane to meet the builder last week.

“Aagane asked him not to ignore calls from the international number and even dialled the gangster from his [Aagane’s] phone,” said the source. “The builder told him he would speak to the gangster later.”

By evening the gangster called up the builder, said the source. He threatened him to pay and said that the builder would meet the fate of a political leader who had been fired at recently.

The builder then lodged a police complaint. Aagane was picked up from Tagore Nagar in Vikhroli. The police claimed that Aagane has admitted to having met the builder at the gangster’s behest. He has also confessed that he had passed on the builder’s number and provided him with updates about the redevelopment project, said a police source.

JAIPUR: Four persons including a 39-year-old Chinese woman have tested negative for novel coronavirus (nCoV). All the four were quarantined at the Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital.

Following the virus scare, the state government has introduced a facility for nCoV diagnostic testing at the SMS Hospital. The facility is helping doctors in getting test reports in a day.

Earlier, the health department had to send samples of suspected nCoV cases to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. All the six persons who had been quarantined at the hospital have tested negative for the disease.

The health department has sought help from collectors to identify people who had travelled to China and returned recently. A similar letter has also been sent to the DGP to seek police help to identify Chinese tourists staying in hotels.

Arrangements have been made at Alwar's ESIC Medical College for keeping nearly 300 Indian citizens airlifted from China's Wuhan city, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.

The batch of passengers has not yet arrived and is likely to arrive on Monday, said Ravi Sharma, a state health department official coordinating with the Centre.

Illustration used for representational purpose

KOCHI: The corporation is conducting a survey of the buildings, where occupancies have been changed without permission from authorities, following an order from the state government.

""We would collect tax from the dates in which the occupancies were changed without the corporation's permission. We will also charge conversion rates. So many such cases have come to our notice in several parts of the city, including in Panampilly Nagar. Hence, we have asked revenue inspectors to start the survey,"" said a corporation official.

The audit wing has been already preparing a report as well mentioning the names of the buildings and the nature of such violations in building rules and occupancy changes.

The move of the audit wing has come in the wake of demolition of four apartment complexes in Maradu following orders from the Supreme Court order. The court order had put focus on various illegalities by apartment owners.

When a property is changed for one use from another, or an extension is built, a certificate of occupancy is usually required, said an official of the audit wing. He said they have identified a pattern in such changes of occupancies done in violations of the building rules.

For instance, several commercial buildings have closed parking areas after securing occupancy certificates. Similarly, residential buildings have been converted for commercial activities without permits.

""Such violations of have been going on for many years. Following the order to demolish the buildings in Maradu, we have started detailed examination of the violations in the city. A detailed report on occupancy violations will be included in the audit next year. We will also examine discrepancies in the printing of receipts also. We have noticed that the same agency has been printing receipts for the local body since 2015,"" said an official of the audit Wing. The audit report of 2018-19 will include the details of the building rule violations and occupancy change without the permission of the authorities.

If any changes or deviations are to be made to the buildings, they should be carried out according to the provisions of the Kerala Municipal Buildings Rules and such changes should be intimated to the civic body's secretary with revised drawings, specifications and details. The changes should not compromise the building requirements, namely, structural stability, safety, health or environmental provisions of central laws and state laws applicable to the buildings covered under Kerala Energy Conservation (Building Code) Rules 2017 also.

Fire force officials in the district have also noticed that changes in the occupancy group of buildings is a common issue in Kochi . ""During renewal of fire NOC, we have noticed that buildings which took final approval for residential purposes have been converted into commercial purpose. In such cases, we deny them renewal,"" said a fire force official.

KOLKATA: The traffic police and Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority ( KMDA ) have prepared a blueprint on traffic dispersal system on EM Bypass with special focus on one stretch — from Chinrighata crossing to Science City crossing, between which a Metro station is coming up. They have suggested a foot overbridge, an underpass and a pedestrian channel at key crossings and a new flyover on a busy stretch of EM Bypass.The police, along with KMDA engineers and bridge experts, conducted a spot inspection, focusing on Chinrighata crossing on Saturday to look into the existing traffic bottlenecks and chalk out plans to disperse huge pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the future once the Metro station near Science City crossing starts operating.“The way both pedestrian and vehicular traffic is increasing on the EM Bypass stretch, specially at some specific crossings, multi-level traffic interchanges are needed to facilitate movement of both vehicles and pedestrians. Advance traffic dispersal planning is also required as a number of Metro stations are being set up on EM Bypass which would create a huge surge of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic,” said a bridge expert.Officials said that the Chinrighata crossing is already in a mess with the existing flyover no more capable for extensive use. KMDA is in the process of engaging IIT Kharagpur to prepare a roadmap for proper traffic dispersal system at the important traffic intersection. KMDA is already working on a foot overbridge at the crossing.Among the new plans that have been conceptualised by the traffic police, bridge experts and KMDA engineers for proper pedestrian and vehicular traffic dispersal are, a new foot overbridge near Dhapa crossing, a vehicular underpass near Captain bheri and a pedestrian channel at Metropolitan crossing.“Once the Metro station becomes operational, both pedestrian and vehicular traffic from Chinrighata to Science City will increase. A foot overbridge at Dhapa crossing and a pedestrian channel at Metropolitan crossing will help disperse this huge pedestrian traffic on both ends, while the vehicular underpass near Captain bheri will help disperse vehicular traffic to check snarls at Chinrighata, Metropolitan and Dhapa crossing,” an official said.KMDA has come up with a plan to set up a flyover from EM Bypass to New Town that will move parallel to the Metro alignment, via Nicco Park and Sector V. Once it’s ready, the existing Chinrighata flyover will be pulled down.Another new flyover has been conceptualised from Chinrighata crossing to Hyatt crossing on EM Bypass to ease traffic congestion. “A small flyover on this stretch for light vehicles will help ease traffic congestion,” said an official.Plans have also been made for a dedicated bus lane near the Metro station at Metropolitan crossing.Officials said that similar traffic plans with multi-level interchanges would also be required near Ruby and Avishikta crossings where Metro stations are coming up.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73889686,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-616330,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-flyover-footbridge-and-underpass-planned-to-handle-bypass-traffic-once-metro-operations-begin/articleshow/73889674.cms

HYDERABAD: Many senior politicians could have financially benefited from redesigning the capital region boundaries, said the CID on Sunday, as it expanded its investigation to probe their role into land pooling. The Andhra Pradesh CID has fast-tracked the probe into allegations of encroached government lands being given in land pooling scheme to AP Capital Regional Development Authority (CRDA).

A source in CID said that the scope of the probe was extended, based on the cabinet sub-committee report. Sources said that transactions involving 4,000 acres were under the scanner in Amaravati.

The CID is already probing illegal transactions and assigned lands after issuing FIR. The cabinet sub-committee had said that many people, privy to the likely location of capital, had bought land in the capital region, between June 1, 2014, and December 31, 2014, just before a formal official declaration was made.

“Certain highly-connected individuals procured land through illegal transactions. We are also probing on the findings that the boundary of the capital area was changed to benefit certain people who had lands on the fringes. Another aspect under probe is the fraudulent surrender of Lanka (river island), Poramboke, government lands towards LPS scheme to receive returnable plots,” said a CID official.

Irregularities in land allotment in CRDA and violation of provisions of AP Assigned Lands (Prohibition of Transfer) Act of 1977 and Violation of Rules of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 have also come under the scanner. The lands were purchased in the mandals of Thullur, Amaravati, Tadikonda, Pedakurapadu, Mangalagiri, Peddakakani, Tadepalli of Guntur district and Ibrahimpatnam , Penamaluru, Vijayawada Rural and Chandarlapadu of Krishna district.

“As per records, lands were bought at nominal rates from farmers right before the notification of the capital. It was established that 2,279.91 acres were purchased in the above-mentioned mandals of Guntur district and 1,790 acres were purchased in the mandals of Krishna district,” said an investigating officer, adding, ““Redrawing the boundaries of CRDA were done later.”

1 Get familiar with the exam pattern To prepare a clear exam preparation strategy you should be well aware of the exam pattern, sections/parts of the paper, important topics, weightage of each section and type of questions asked in the exam. Take help from your subject teacher or you can refer to the previous years’ papers to find out more details about the exam pattern. Based on your knowledge of exam pattern, divide your chapters and allocate study hours for each one of them.

2 Study your syllabus thoroughly The students are advised to thoroughly study all the chapters in the NCERT Biology book and stick to the topics prescribed in the syllabus. Most of the questions asked in the previous board examinations were from the syllabus only. Make sure you read every topic in the syllabus and avoid the mistake of speculating the chapters.

3 Practice diagrams Diagrams in the Biology paper are important. Using diagrams of various organs and tissues of plants as well as animals is an inseparable part of understanding Botany and Zoology. Long answers with the support of relevant diagrams always help in fetching maximum marks in the exam. Also, make sure you remember nomenclature and other difficult terminologies.

4 Revise multiple times before exam Revision of the topics that you have already studied will help you clear many doubts which will eventually boost your confidence.

Uddhav Thackeray

MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray reiterated that he would not allow the National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) in the state, but defended the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), saying it would not take away anyone's citizenship.

In a video clip of a three-part series of an interview with Sena mouthpiece, Saamna, Thackeray responded to Saamna's executive editor Sanjay Raut saying, ""CAA is not the Act to remove anybody from the country, but about giving citizenship to persecuted minorities like Buddhists, Christens, Jains from neighbouring nations.""

About NRC, he said, ""Proving citizenship would be a difficult part for both Hindu and Muslim communities.""

CPI-M leader Sitaram Yechury welcomed Thackeray's comment on NRC, but suggested that Maharashtra government also pass a resolution to not accept the CAA and NRC in its legislative assembly.

In January, Thackeray had met a delegation of Muslims who had sought a resolution against CAA in the assembly, like Kerala and Punjab and Thackeray had said Mumbai is home to everyone, but not promised any resolution.

HONG KONG: Hundreds of Hong Kong medical workers walked off their jobs on Monday, demanding the city close its border with China to reduce the coronavirus spreading -- with frontline staff threatening to follow in the coming days.The financial hub has 15 confirmed cases of the disease, many of them brought over from the Chinese mainland where the epidemic began and has so far killed more than 360 people.The action by non-essential medical staff comes as the city's pro-Beijing leadership resists completely sealing the border.Authorities have argued that doing so would be discriminatory, economically damaging and go against advice from the World Health Organisation.Instead, the city government has closed down some crossings and says arrivals from the mainland have dropped significantly.But there is growing public anger in a city that maintains a deep historical mistrust of the mainland after the 2003 SARS outbreak -- which was initially covered up by Beijing -- killed nearly 300 Hong Kongers.Thousands of members of a newly formed medical worker union voted to strike on Saturday unless their demand for the border to be closed was met, with the first group downing tools on Monday.The first strikers are ""non-essential"" staff but the union has said frontline workers, including doctors and nurses, will walk out on Tuesday if their demands are not met.Staff gathered outside hospitals across the city on Monday morning, handing white ribbons to colleagues encouraging them to join the strike action.""If there is no full border closure, there won't be enough manpower, protective equipment, or isolation rooms, to combat the outbreak,"" Winnie Yu, chairwoman of the 9,000 member Hospital Authority Employees Alliance, told reporters.Talks with the government broke down on Sunday after the union said city leader Carrie Lam had decided to not attend discussions in person.The Hospital Authority, which employs some 75,000 people, said it sympathised with calls to lower the risk of new infections but was opposed to industrial action, saying patients would suffer.It warned half of pre-booked operations would be cancelled or delayed by the strike.Hong Kong's government criticised the industrial action, calling on workers to ""reconsider their decision, continue to safeguard Hong Kong with their professionalism and together win the battle against the disease"".The virus outbreak comes at a politically precarious time for the city's pro-Beijing leaders who currently have record-low approval ratings after deploying the police to face down seven months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests.Animosity towards Beijing and mainlanders has also risen steeply in recent years in lockstep with Hong Kongers pushing for democracy.Many in Hong Kong feel an increasingly authoritarian Beijing is clamping down on the city's freedoms.And they also resent the economic pressures caused by the huge influx of mainland immigrants and day-trippers to the city, something that has helped ramp up prices of everything from pharmacy goods to retail rents and housing.Anti-mainland sentiment has sometimes exploded into outright bigotry, especially online where insults and slurs abound.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73889826,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-140334,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/hong-kong-medics-strike-for-china-border-closure-over-virus-fears/articleshow/73889731.cms

MELBOURNE: Sofia Kenin is expressive. It's in her stance, in her stride, the fire in her eyes. In the words coming at you at the pace of bullets from a Sten gun. Like her tennis, she leaves it all out there. It's all said and done, one way or the other.Kenin, who won her maiden major title at Melbourne Park on Saturday, was in tears after she turned the match around in the second set. Tears rolled down her cheeks as she collected balls, preparing to serve. Commentators picked it up and viewers wondered what was up. Those seated in the lower bowls of the Rod Laver Arena were a little stunned. Was she hurt? What was up? The 21-year-old was in control of the match, or as close to it when still live.Kenin, now the top-ranked American at No. 7 in the world, explained to the media that she was getting anxious as she approached the finish line. ""I felt I was getting closer to the title, something that I really wanted. I knew I needed to somehow try and relax, just try to calm down. I looked a few times to my box. They cheered for me, calmed me down,"" she said.Garbine Muguruza, who was the favourite in the final, given that she had already won Major titles twice, was surprised by how well her younger opponent handled the situation. ""I was nervous when I played my first Grand Slam final. She held pretty good her emotions,"" the 26-year-old said.Alexander, Kenin's father and coach, a man of generous build and a relaxed step, said his daughter was nervous before and during the final. She was crying before the final, also before most of her matches, coming into the title round. ""She was really, really nervous. I think it's normal. How can you not be nervous? You're playing in a Grand Slam, in a final. I am nervous,"" said Alexander, who says the best way to handle nerves is to get busy. The duo discussed strategy, they watched previous matches, studied statistics and mapped a road. ""We try to problem solve,"" Alexander said.Kenin says she has always been confident. ""The confidence has come with all the matches that I've had success in the last year. I am the WTA 's Most Improved Player of the Year, FYI (for your information),"" she said.Alexander said ever since he can remember, perhaps from the time she was battering down his garage door in Pembroke Pines, Florida , she knew where she was headed. ""She always wanted to be No. 1, win a Grand Slam,"" he said. ""She hates to lose, it's just not an option.""Kenin, whose parents moved out of the Soviet Union in the late 80s, returning to Moscow only to have their daughter because they couldn't afford care in the United States, acknowledged her roots even as she embraced the American way of life.""I've looked up to Maria Sharapova , Anna Kournikova . I followed their matches. I feel like I got the feisty. I saw what it's like. Maria won a Grand Slam at 17, I remember watching it on TV. I have part of Russian stuff inside me, fight and fierce,"" she said before adding.

Representative image

PUNE: The civic body may take possession of over 80,000 properties in the city as their owners failed to clear tax dues despite several reminders.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) recently issued notices to 80,000 property tax defaulters in this regard. Civic officials said the PMC has already taken possession of 35 such properties and converted them into municipal assets.

The civic body has set a property tax target of Rs1,970.2 crore for the next financial year (2020-2021).

To achieve this, new municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad has proposed a 12% hike in property tax in the draft civic budget for financial year 2020-2021, through which the PMC hopes to rope in an additional income of Rs150 crore.

“Some of the owners are genuinely incapable of paying the property tax. Legal cases pertaining to property ownership, too, have led to the pendency,” said Vilas Kanade, head of PMC’s property tax department.

He said the PMC had issued notices to the defaulters and also set a deadline for the dues to be cleared.

If the owners fail to clear their dues, a warrant is issued, following which the process of confiscation of properties starts and the PMC puts its name on the 7/12 extract of the property.

For the current fiscal, the PMC had set a property tax target of Rs2,100 crore. Of this, it has collected around Rs1,300 crore so far.

The civic administration has also started recovering tax from 11 villages that were merged in the civic limits in 2017. “Owners of around 7.8 lakh properties have paid the tax. Owners of nearly 2.4 lakh properties are yet to make the payment,” a civic official said.

The civic officials said the PMC’s revenue was likely to go up as many new properties, including those from the newly merged villages, had been registered in the past two years in the municipal limits.

306,['3/02/2020'],EC shifts out senior cop over shooting incidents,"This story is from February 3, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Commission on Sunday transferred DCP (South-East) Chinmoy Biswal after it reportedly found his continuance in the post not conducive to holding a free, fair and impartial election in Delhi. The action, said sources, is linked to the firing incident at Shaheen Bagh on Saturday, in which youth from Dallupura had fired two rounds in the air near the site of ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Bill.

Biswal, who EC said stands relieved from his post with immediate effect, will be replaced by Kumar Gyanesh , senior additional DCP (South-East).

Biswal, for now, will report to the ministry of home affairs, as directed by per EC.

Sources said the poll panel had received adverse reports from its observers as well as special police observer about the handling of security arrangements and policing around the site of anti-CAA protests in Shaheen Bagh. This was corroborated in the report received from the Delhi chief electoral officer, said sources. “Given that the area is so sensitive in view of the ongoing protests and the impending election and since one incident of random firing by a civilian has earlier taken place in Jamia Nagar area, it was expected that the security around the anti-CAA dharna site would be further beefed up with strict access control and constant vigil against any attempt to create a communally-charged situation. But the second firing incident happened despite EC’s directions to field-level officers at the poll review meeting held on Friday, to take swift action wherever warranted in the interest of fair, just, legal and impartial election in Delhi. It was particularly stressed that law and order arrangements in the identified vulnerable polling booths must be tightened ahead of polling day,” said an EC official.

The meeting on Friday was convened by EC for a comprehensive review of the poll arrangements including state of law and order. It was attended by a chief electoral officer of Delhi, district election officers, special commissioner of police, district commissioners of police, nodal officers and chief executives of local bodies. A second meeting was also held by EC with state chief secretary, home secretary, finance secretary, Delhi Police commissioner, Delhi CEO and special commissioners of police.

As exclusively reported by TOI earlier, EC also felt Delhi Police should have filed an FIR against Union minister Anurag Thakur and BJP leader Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma for their communal remarks, which EC has held in violation of Section 123(3A) and Section 125 of Representation of the People Act. The latter section provides for imprisonment of up to three years. A senior EC functionary had told TOI that both the district magistrate concerned and Delhi Police were empowered under CrPC and IPC to direct filing of/file and FIR in the said instances, without waiting for a direction from EC.

307,['3/02/2020'],50 days of protests at Shaheen Bagh: 'We will stay here until they change',"This story is from February 3, 2020

NEW DELHI: Goli Nahin Phool (Flowers not bullets) was the clarion call at Shaheen Bagh on Sunday, a day after a man opened fire a few metres away from the protest site. The aftermath of the shooting was apparent - fresh ropes had been tied to secure the barricades at the entrance of the protest site, security was heightened and outsiders' IDs were being checked. But the quiet determination of women protesters had never been so apparent before.

The women's protest has continued through the coldest winters, with protesters battling more than just the harsh weather. There have been allegations of them being politically motivated and funded by fringe groups. But they have found support in students, artists and activists. On Sunday, members of this leaderless group came together to celebrate the spirit of the women of the small neighbourhood in southeast Delhi.

The blue and yellow tent echoed with chants of "" Desh ke pyaaron par, phool barsaao saaro par"" as flower petals were showered on the women who have become the face of the protests against CAA, NRC and NPR.

""People use flowers to communicate love and to worship Gods. We thought it can be used here to spread the idea of peace,"" Jaya Aiyer, a theatre artist, a participant in the #GoliNahinPhool intitiative.

The 50th day of the sit-in had begun with a nukkad performance around 10pm. Nearly a dozen students dressed in black highlighted the hatred dominating the current political discourse. By 12pm, the crowd had swelled, with thousands gathering at the protest site, anticipating violence after Hindu Sena's call for volunteers to empty the stretch of road of protesters.

The fringe outfit later recalled its statement, but a crowd of men turned up at the protest site, demanding that the road be cleared. They shouted slogans, calling for protesters to be shot, but were later dispersed by police.

The women, aware of the threats being made just a kilometre away, were balanced in their approach. They appealed for peace at regular intervals, often reminding speakers to avoid any statement that could be construed as communal.

""Our fight is to safeguard the rights guaranteed by the constitution. Over the last few days, there have been attempts to polarise the situation but our message of inclusivity still stands,"" said Prakash Devi, a resident of Karol Bagh, one of the volunteers who micromanages the stage.

A few days ago, the official handle of the protest site had put out a call asking artists and influencers to come and address the crowd. Actor Kusha Kapila, famous for playing the fictional character 'Billi Maasi', was one of those who responded to the call and reached the protest site around 6, amid thundering applause.

Representatives from JNU Student's Union also reached the site around 5pm.

Addressing the gathering, Saket Moon, JNUSU vice president, said, ""We students salute the courage of mothers and daughters of Shaheen Bagh. You all inspire us everyday to fight in the face of hate.""

As the day came to an end, one of the women protesters commented on the role women have come to play in the current political discourse. ""Women have found their political instinct for the first time in many years. They will counter the hate and change power dynamics. There's a wave of change, and until they do, we will be right here,"" she said.

308,['3/02/2020'],Land is still the biggest stumbling block for investors in Karnataka,"This story is from February 3, 2020

A bird’s-eye view of the Special Economic Zone in Mangaluru

BENGALURU: For long, acquisition of farm land for industries has been a major constraint for investors in Karnataka because of bureaucratic red tape and intricate land reform laws .

The problem is so acute that about 90% of investments proposals cleared by the state government through the State High Level Clearance Committee (SHLCC) between 2013 and 2018 have not been realised due to hurdles in land acquisition, according to officials in the state industries department.

Of around 140 proposals worth Rs 49,379 crore cleared between 2013 and 2018 under Section 109, about 90%remained non-starters. About 23 proposals are said to have been dropped. Even the majority of proposals cleared in two editions of Global Investor Meets held during the BJP regime between 2008 and 2012 have remained on paper.

Keen to shake off the perception of its investorunfriendly image, the Karnataka government recently announced a plan to cut red tape by setting a 30-day time limit for bureaucratic clearances.

This seemed to have been triggered by chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s recent experience at Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum. He met UK-based steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal and extended an invitation to invest in Karnataka. Mittal mentioned delays by the administration and Yediyurappa later said, “His concern seemed to be genuine.”

As a first step, the government has proposed to amend Section 109 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act 1961, which deals with purchase of agriculture land directly by investors to make the process quick and time-bound.

The proposed amendment, likely to be tabled in the upcoming legislature session, will require competent authorities to provide permission to purchase farm land within 30 days for projects cleared by the State High Level Clearance Committee and State Level Single Window Clearance Committee. If the deadline lapses, then permission, both for purchase and land use change under Section 95 of Karnataka Land Revenue Act 1964, will be deemed to have been granted.

Though many industrialists welcomed the move, they see it as nothing more than a cosmetic change while stating adherence to rules and addressing critical issues bothering them is more important.

“The government must change its attitude towards industries, not rules. Section 109 in its current form has deadlines for giving permission for purchase of land and its conversion. The clauses of deemed permission and deemed conversion are also there. But the problem is in honouring the deadlines. There’s not even a single instance in the past 15 years where the government has met these deadlines. So, what’s the guarantee that the new 30-day timeframe will be honoured?” asks Vasant Ladava, an industrialist from Hubballi.

Another hurdle is the Karnataka Land reforms Act, which restricts non-agriculturists with over Rs 25 lakh annual income from purchasing agriculture land. This law is in place to prevent misuse of farmland and ensure food security. Earlier, the income limit was Rs 2 lakh but it was hiked to Rs 25 lakh in 2015.

This leaves investors with two options; one, to buy land from Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board, a nodal agency for acquiring land for industrial purpose, which has created 20,000 acres of land bank in select places. Two, they can buy land on their own by seeking special permission from competent authorities under Section 109 of the KLR Act, which in its current form, some industrialists allege, is a cumbersome process beset by red tape and corruption.

Both options have become investor-unfriendly in recent times. For instance, KIADB, which acquires land from farmers, will sell land to investors for profit after developing it. “If KIADB acquired land for Rs 50 lakh per acre from farmers, it demands Rs 1.2 crore to Rs 1.5 crore per acre from investors. It also takes its own time to acquire and develop land, thereby increasing cost of investment,” says Mahendra H Ladhad, president, Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Hubballi, Concurring with his views, a senior IAS officer, who worked in the industries department earlier, said: “Industries have been facing a tough time in land acquisition and getting approvals in Karnataka for many years. Land rates are also high when compared to neighbouring states and, as a result, Karnataka has lost substantial investment proposals to Tamil Nadu and Telangana in recent times. Though the government has put restrictions on non-agriculturists to purchase farm land, it is neither helping farmers nor industries.’’ Many industrialists believe that the only solution to end the land acquisition problem is to lift restrictions on non-agriculturists. “Like in neighbouring states Tamil Nadu and Telangana, we should allow industries to purchase land directly from farmers. The interference of government means more layers of obstacles and more scope for delays and corruption,” said another official.

Though the proposal to do away with these restrictions has been placed before the government, it often develops cold feet as they fear a backlash from farmers, a core vote-bank.

MUMBAI: A group of women on Sunday evening tried to stage a sit-in protest against the implementation of CAA, NRC and NPR outside a garden in Deonar , but police foiled their bid, an officer said.

“The women...tried to squat on the road outside the garden. We asked them to vacate the road, but they didn't budge. We have shifted some of them to the police station. They will be released soon,” said Deonar police senior inspector Ragini Bhagwat. Additional commissioner of police Lakhmi Gautam said the women were not being detained. “The details of 20 women are being collected and they will be allowed to leave,” he added. A group of 15 graffiti artists from Delhi also joined the anti-CAA protests at Mumbra’s Shaheen Bagh, which is on since nearly a fortnight. Durriya Ghadiyali, a protester, said the artists were denied permission to create artwork on the road, so they painted their support messages on cloth banners.

The women-led vigil at Mumbai Bagh in Byculla entered its seventh night Sunday.

Former MLA Waris Pathan said, “The coordination committee of Mumbai Bagh will meet home minister Anil Deshmukh on Monday to direct police to permit us to use megaphones to address the assembly.

CHENNAI: Traffic comes to a standstill on the Loop Road between Light House and Foreshore Estate as the beach promenade has been converted into a market by vendors.

While fish and vegetable vendors have eated into the road space, customers on wheels, who make a beeline to Marina, add to the menace by blocking the entry to the road.

The 19m-wide road has got shrunk to a few metres causing misery for motorists who use the Loop Road to reach their destinations quicker.

M Subramani, an auto rickshaw driver from Basin Bridge, said the bottleneck begins with encroachment by vendors. ""The vendors selling fish occupy about 20 feet of the 60 feet wide road on either sides. Thanks to availability of fresh fish, the market attracts people from across the city... those with vehicles park them in the middle of the road,"" he said.

Bharati, president of South Indian Fishermen Welfare Association, said that fisherfolk have been traditionally engaged in selling fish on the stretch for several years. ""It was never a road meant for vehicular traffic till two day decades ago, but a traditional pathway for fishermen to access sea,"" he said. Moreover, traffic congestion happens only on Sunday, he added. ""About 300 vendors are operating on Loop Road,"" he said.

Officials of the corporation refused to comment on the traffic quagmire and said the issue of Loop Road was a sub-judice matter as a case had been filed in the Madras High Court over its expansion.

However, because the sample size of the 40-plus group was small of about 25 women, the researchers said that further studies need to be done to validate the results.The median age of the participants in the study was 32.According to the researcher's nose is never taken as a focus to treat aging but like any other feature of the body, nose which is made up of soft tissue, bone, and cartilage, ages too.""The nose loses support as it ages and can take on a more prominent or droopy appearance,"" said another researcher Dr. Jason Roostaeian.The nose is also affected when other features of the face age.""When we lose facial fat and volume in our cheeks, which are the canvas that our nose sits on, the nose becomes more prominent,"" said Roostaeian.""This is something we have subjectively thought for many decades but now we have objective evidence through artificial intelligence to support this,"" he added.The researchers further said that the youthful appearance of the entire face can be refined by refining the nose.With inputs from ANI",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73872442,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-799492/73872442.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/beauty/study-claims-to-have-finally-found-the-secret-that-can-make-women-look-younger/articleshow/73872446.cms

BENGALURU: The top two e-tailers, Amazon and Flipkart, are worried over the introduction of new tax clause on e-commerce transactions fearing it will hurt the growth of third-party sellers online and deter small businesses to come online, according to senior industry executives. Amazon India told TOI that it will seek clarification from the government on the issue and is 'hoping for a simple and uniform tax regime'.

Sources in these firms are also of the view that the new tax should not be imposed on the gross sale value and could be charged after excluding various costs of selling online - including the marketplace fee charged by e-commerce players. Last month Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, during his India visit, had said Amazon will invest $1 billion to digitise small and medium businesses and bring 10 million small businesses online by 2025.

On Saturday, the government introduced a new withholding tax on e-commerce transactions in the union budget. What this would mean is -- companies like Amazon India and Flipkart will withhold an additional 1% tax-deduction-at-source (TDS) while making payments to merchants who sell goods on their platforms. This would be in addition to the GST tax deduction that e-tailers charge online sellers. Online sellers are worried this will impact their liquidity and e-tailers are worried that it would impact their platforms as they try to widen their base of independent sellers.

“We are studying the details, and will reach out to the government for clarifications. We hope the tax regime is simple and uniform so that millions of small and medium businesses can go online, digitise their operations and continue to contribute to growing the economy,"" a spokesperson of Amazon India said. Walmart-owned Flipkart has declined to comment on the matter so far.

“Small-scale sellers would now think twice about taking their business online. Instead of promoting small businesses online, it will do the opposite. Seller ecosystem will be impacted negatively,” another senior executive at an e-commerce firm said. While Amazon has 5.5 lakh sellers in India Flipkart has over a lakh sellers on its platform.

“In certain cases where the payment is not routed through e-commerce player, they would be under an obligation to withhold tax when they are not involved in collection of payments from consumers and payment to the sellers. Hence, business models may need to be re-visited to ensure that cash flow issues and procedural difficulties are minimised,” said Anil Talreja , partner, Deloitte India .

NEW DELHI: The pistol used by 25-year-old Kapil Gurjar to open fire at the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest site at Shaheen Bagh was acquired by him seven years ago. Gurjar told police that he had bought it for celebratory firing during his brother's wedding and had hidden it from his parents. However, he has been evading questions about where he bought the weapon.

Police are scanning through his Facebook profile to find out whether he was influenced by someone to carry out the attack. Gurjar's profile was deleted immediately after his arrest. His family's antecedents will also be analysed.

Meanwhile, a Delhi court sent Gurjar to two-day police custody. Police will verify his claims and also from where he procured his pistol.

The officer who interrogated Gurjar told TOI that he gave evasive replies when asked where he procured the pistol from. ""He remained composed during the investigation, but did not cooperate much, giving multiple replies to the same question. Looking at his conversations and body language, Gurjar does not seem to be mentally disturbed,"" the officer said. However, Gurjar told one of the investigators, "" Apne desh mein kab tak dab ke rahenge? (For how long will we live suppressed in our country)""

Gurjar's father told police he did not know about his son's plans or that he had a pistol.

The accused said that he was not affiliated with any political party and was angry because of the traffic jams due to the protests. Police have seized his mobile phone and are scanning the call data records and WhatsApp chats.

HUBBALLI: Hubballi city has necessary potential to grow as a second metro city in Karnataka, but the onus is on locals to unitedly put pressure on elected representatives and officials to ensure the same, said Mohandas Pai , chairman of Aarin Capital and Manipal Global Education.

Sharing his views at 'Evening with Legends', organised as part of Development Dialogue-2020 here on Saturday evening, he said many entrepreneurs have been urging the government to develop Hubballi as another IT city in the state, but to no avail. ""Even a group of IT entrepreneurs and enthusiasts was formed here, but it did not get local support. Locals should own up and help develop Hubballi,"" he said.

Endorsing the same, Ajai Chowdhry, founder of HCL, said many positive things are happening in Hubballi in recent years, thanks to the initiatives of Deshpande Foundation. ""I would like to contribute to develop entrepreneurship here,"" he said.

Recalling the history of Vijaynagar (the erstwhile kingdom in Ballari), mentor Rajeev said it was the second-largest city in the country in the 15th century. ""Hubballi, which is close to Vijaynagar, can be developed as the second city on the lines of Pune or Nagpur in Maharashtra,"" he said.

Former IPS officer Annamalai also spoke. Gururaj Deshpande, co-founder of Deshpande Foundation, moderated the session.

PUNE: The Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation ( IRSDC ) is set to float tenders for the re-development of the city and Shivajinagar stations with an aim to start the actual work this year.AN IRSDC official said the aim of the initiative was to turn these stations into ‘Rail-O-polis’. These ‘re-devopment hubs’ will have establishments such as a commercial centre, mall or hotel nearby.The IRSDC had taken over the over the Pune railway station’s facility management barely a year ago.“The re-development of some select stations is being done by two agencies — IRSDC and the Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA). In its Union Budget on Saturday, the central government referred to the redevelopment of four stations under the public private partnership (PPP) model,” IRSDC managing director and chief executive officer S K Lohia said.“The RLDA is handling 44 stations and we are redeveloping 60 stations across the country. In some cases, we are jointly doing the work. We will soon float tenders for the re-development project of the Pune and the Shivajinagar stations under the PPP Model. The building of the Pune station is a heritage structure and we will not touch it,” he told TOI.The IRSDC had in December 2018 taken over the Pune station from the Railways for its facility management and appointed city-based BVG India for the work.“We also have to do the redevelopment of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and its building is also a heritage structure. The idea behind it is to get the railway land near these stations and develop them into proper commercial ‘Rail-o-polis’. We had some issues as far as Shivajinagar station is concerned. But all the issues have been resolved,” Lohia said.In December 2019, the IRSDC had invited bids for the re-development of Nagpur, Gwalior, Amravati and Sabarmati stations at an investment of around Rs1,300 crore. In October last year, Niti Ayog CEO Amitabh Kant had written to Railway Board, stressing the need to re-develop 50 stations on a priority basis .Sources said besides getting bidders, land availability was also problem at times for the redevelopment programme. “The project doesn’t include land acquisition, as plots belonging to the Railways will be used. But availability of railway land near the stations is a problem. Then there are issues of finding a bidder. So, floating tenders is just not enough. The authorities need to convince the bidders about the project viability,” a source in the Railways privy to the development said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73890375,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-171746,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/irsdc-to-soon-float-pune-station-re-development-tenders/articleshow/73890231.cms
323,['3/02/2020'],Taxing remittances might prove onerous,"This story is from February 3, 2020

(Representative image)

BENGALURU: Many fear it might prove onerous if the government started taxing remittances. In the Finance Bill , the government has proposed a 5% tax collection at source (TCS) for remittances over Rs 7 lakh under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme. This will block a big chunk of funds for those wishing to send money overseas.

The Finance Bill states, ""banks who receive Rs 7 lakh from an individual for remittance out of India under the LRS or from a seller of a tour package shall debit a sum equal to five percent of the remitted amount as income tax.""

Manipal Global Education chairman Mohandas Pai on Sunday raised the issue of taxing remittances. In a tweet to the FM, he asked, “5% tax collection at source for remittances over Rs 7 lakh. Sir this is very wrong; why is there a tax on our own tax paid money when we remit? Where is ease of living?”

TOI has reported that Indians on average send $1.5 billion (Rs 10,700 crore) abroad every month for various reasons like student fees, travel, gifts, and medical treatment. If taxed at 5%, the government will be able to raise about $75 million every month.

India is one of the top recipients of remittances but outward remittances are relatively low. The global average cost of sending was around 7% in 2019, according to the World Bank 's Remittance Prices Worldwide database.

""Now with the taxation, the amount one sends overseas will further get eaten into,"" said the chief technical officer of a remittances firm.

Shailesh Haribhakti, founder and chief mentor of auditing firm Baker Tilly DHC, said in an era of falling interest rates and falling growth it is very difficult to extract significant returns on investments out of LRS. ""This 5% deduction would need a review in the light of returns actually being generated from LRS remittances. Simple analytics of the reported incomes will reveal the need quite clearly,"" he said.

K R Sekar, partner in Deloitte, said, ""It's an added cost. If I have to send my son for education in the US, why should I pay 5% tax to the government? It's a ridiculous move to tax these items on the premise that this is a luxury item, which is not the case.""

HUBBALLI: The Hubballi-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transport Service ( HD-BRTS ) Company Ltd is a government project involving 13 agencies - five funding and monitoring agencies, two implementing agencies, one each for monitoring, operational, design consultancy, Project Management Consultant (PMC) for civil works, PMC for ITS works and a stakeholder - to build the dedicated bus corridor along 22.25km between Hubballi and Dharwad.

Though both BJP and Congress claim credit for the implementation of the project, people had been holding Union minister Pralhad Joshi and district minister Jagadish Shettar responsible for the delay of over seven years. When HDBRTS Company, a state government undertaking, was registered under the Companies Act on May 7, 2012, it was said that buses will ply in two years. Though the estimated cost in the beginning was Rs 692 crore, it ended up at Rs 970.33 crore. With the assurance of safe, affordable and world-class bus rapid transit infrastructure and services, HD-BRTS work started in 2012. Land acquisition was the first hurdle for the ambitious project. However, elected representatives and officials cleared the hurdle amidst allegations of partiality in acquiring the land and the related pricing. Though promoting the participation of citizens in the planning process was one of the objectives, people were kept out.

BRTS, which claims itself being environment-friendly, did not keep its word on planting saplings along the corridor. Another major miss is the use of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). But BRTS escaped from this responsibility by saying the buses were ordered in 2012-13. It has adopted Euro-IV engine buses, which are already outdated in developed countries.

327,['3/02/2020'],"Pune: From the Wood-works, modded motorcycles &amp; unique bicycles","This story is from February 3, 2020

Albert Wood with the customised Thunderbird, one of his earlier projects.

The motorcycles rolling off the factory production line, though well-structured, are plain vanilla machines for some in terms of look and feel. Spanking yet staid; engineering paragons yet underwhelming and boring; fuel efficient… yawn!! These days, guys in their leathers don’t often go hammering down the road noisily to grab attention but they sure want their beasts to be head-turning, visual distractions.

That’s where the likes of Albert Wood come in, jazzing up motorbikes with engine modifications and exterior embellishments — all while sticking to the legal scheme of things. He also manufactures unique bicycles , but more on that later.

Operating from his workshop in the Pune cantonment, the 30-year-old Wood interestingly says he never had a passion for motorcycles and has no engineering or mechanical background either. A career in soccer would have been an option for him earlier, having played for Pune and Maharashtra as a student, but his legs ran weary long before the Indian super league emerged to snap up promising players.

Wood, however, had entrepreneurial dreams, which he cherished even during his long stint in the field of marketing. He started his new venture 18 months ago, restoring and customising two of his own motorcycles — an Avenger and a TVS Victor. Both found ready buyers, firing his interest to build motorcycles right from the ground up. Today, he has already customised around 25 bikes, with heavy-duty modifications having turned some of them into café racers and cruisers.

Wood operates singlehandedly. An ongoing project on a 2007 Pulsar will see him cutting the frame, changing the tank and handle, and fitting improved shock absorbers, broader tyres, a Harley mask in front and a rather selfish no-pillion seat. An earlier customisation on a Thunderbird was for a tall, muscular guy with a love for long rides. Wood first lowered the seat and extended the backrest for comfort before customising the tank, speedometer and lamps.

Wood has invested Rs 2.5 lakh in machinery and taught himself designing, cutting, grinding, welding, buffing and pipe bending. The markup on the modded bike is low; there’s no competition in the market for his reasonable selling price, he says.

While working in a resort in Goa, Wood first saw a tandem bicycle (to be ridden by two people) standing among mini-carts lugging vacationers submitting to torpidity while on holiday. He’s manufactured his own tandems since and is eyeing a market for them in the 2,000-odd resorts across the country. Apart from tandems, he makes cruising, women’s and advertising bicycles in offbeat sizes. The cycles are tubeless and gearless, and are designed for commute, not speed.

The innovator has a soft corner for the small-time motorcycle mechanics with unsung customisation skills. He was fortunate to have money to put into his business but knows banks won’t lend easily to other bikebuilders. He plans to hold an annual bazaar where these mechanics can showcase their customisation works.

Wood refuses to rate any of his several motorcycle projects as the best, saying each one has been unique. But he derives maximum satisfaction when the modded bike speeds out of his workshop and the owner pulls up along the way to scream his gratitude over the phone.

SHIMLA: To put an end to the practice of caste-based discrimination during the serving of midday meals in government schools, the Himachal Pradesh education department has directed the schools to ensure that children are made to sit according to their roll numbers. This is not the first time that such an order has been issued.

In a circular issued to the deputy directors of high education on January 31, director (education) Amarjeet Kumar Sharma said that despite several instructions issued earlier, incidents of discrimination against dalit students while serving of midday meals are still being reported.

""It is, therefore, once again forcefully reiterated that such type of discrimination should be completely stopped,"" he said.

Directing the schools to ensure that students are made to sit according to their roll numbers at meal time, he asserted that this programme should be used as a vehicle for inculcation of good habits, discipline and spirit of equality among children. The circular refers to the midday meal scheme guidelines which stipulate that community members, teachers and department officials must ensure that children eat the midday meal together and sit according to their roll numbers without any discrimination.

The department has even warned of strict action against those indulging in such acts and directed the deputy directors to issue instructions to all schools regarding discrimination on the basis of religion, caste and creed and also sensitise parents and public in this regard.

HYDERABAD: Students of the University of Hyderabad (UoH) have pointed out discrepancies in the selection process of research scholars in the admissions which were conducted in January 2020, and claimed that the varsity failed to fill reserved category seats despite the availability of eligible candidates.Members of the Ambedkar Students Association (ASA), who obtained the interview mark-sheets of several candidates through RTI, alleged that several students were denied a seat with a remark saying that their performance was ‘not satisfactory’.“While about 25 students appeared for the interview for a PhD seat in the education department, the panel gave marks to just seven students. For all the remaining candidates, ‘not satisfactory’ was written in the marks column,” said Gopi Swamy , convener, ASA adding that even the candidate who topped the written examination was not awarded any marks in the interview.He said that as per the UGC guidelines, interviewers have to mandatorily award marks. “Inspite of having a vacancy in the reserved category, two students belonging to the Muslim community were not given admission in the education department,” he added.“While the PhD seats under the general category were filled, reserved seats under OBC and SC category for Material Engineering were left vacant during the admissions. The Department of English has also not filled the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category and left the seats vacant. In the Department of Psychology, two SC seats have been left vacant,” said M Iniyavan, president, ASA adding that UGC mandates that a special admission drive must be conducted to fill the vacant seats from the reserved category.The official spokesperson of UoH, Vinod Pavarala said that when a similar issue was raised during July, they asked the departments to reconsider admission recommendations. “Subsequently, few students were given admissions and remaining vacant seats were advertised in January. Now that the students have raised the issue again, the issue will be examined afresh by the varsity,” said Pavarala, who was also the chair of the Admission Grievance Committee, which looked into the issue in July last year.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73890608,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-28391,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-claim-inconsistencies-in-university-of-hyderabads-selection-of-research-scholars/articleshow/73890619.cms

MYSURU: The sudden rise in the mercury levels has created a summer-like feeling in Myuru and Kodagu . The maximum temperature in these two districts have been more than 4 degrees celsius above normal.

On Saturday, temperature touched 34.5 degrees Celsius in Mysuru and 31.9 degrees Celsius in Kodagu. The average temperature for February is 31.1 degrees celsius in Mysuru and 28.2 degrees celsius in Kodagu.

The temperature is expected to rise further with the IMD predicting clear sky over Mysuru and Kodagu in the next one week. Experts observe that South Interior Karnataka will witness frequent heatwaves this summer. KSNDMC director G Srinivasa Reddy attributed the rising temperature to the increased sea surface temperature in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. ""The winter has vanished.

However, variations in temperature are causing rain in many places. ""Rainfall is expected in the Malnad region due to soaring temperature,"" said Reddy.

The operators will have to shoulder the responsibility for it, Jagtap added.The state government in 2016-17 decided to start weekly farmers’ markets to promote farm produce and provide a platform to the farmers. It had directed local self-governing bodies to provide land to farmers.

But many political leaders have grabbed the opportunity and started weekly bazaars in their wards.

338,['3/02/2020'],'We should offer accident insurance for polo players',"This story is from February 3, 2020

JAIPUR: Marketing. It's a two-way street that requires sincere interest in the sponsor's objectives and how it can help them achieve goals. In today's sports world, all major events are advertised and promoted on multiple platforms to ensure viewers for the events.

Secure in the belief that it can also help polo in Rajasthan make a turnaround, Kaushal Doda, director of Sphiro Infratech Pvt Limited is mulling to set up a polo institute in Jaipur and involve sponsors in a big way. With the help of famous rider like Dhruvpal Godara, they will approach the state government, seeking a land for the purpose.

""But the project will never be shelved if we don't get the government help or not,"" Doda said. He believes the training institute will help educate and nurture talents.

""There would be a proper infrastructure and we can save a lot of money. Our first priority is to offer personal accident insurance for players in case of accident or injury. Today, the majority are either inadequately insured, or are not insured at all. I feel we should look into the matter seriously.""

Happy to see that opportunities are more widespread, and polo is being seen as a sport, he stressed on the fact that instead of inviting polo riders from Delhi or other places, Rajasthan should have a right infrastructure to groom the young talents.

""In that way, we can open avenues for others, who are directly or indirectly involved with the trade, like trainers, animal doctors, and those who can look after the stables. It can also create job opportunities. It's not an utopian idea and I mean it,"" he stated.

Handicap +5player, Dhruvpal has been playing the sport for the past 25 years and has set a standard among the few non-army personnel to have achieved great heights in a sport often associated with the armed forces. Naturally, he believes it's the right time to take the step forward.

""It makes me sad when I find polo doesn't attract the attention of spectators not much as it did before. People know Angad Kalan, Samsher Singh, Basir Ali, Padmanabh Singh . But how? Because the spectators love and admire them. And it's no exaggeration if I say the fans may be sometime tempted to give it a try.""

Reminiscing the day when the Rambagh Polo Club was chock-o-block with spectators, hooting for the local side during a match sometime back, Dhruvpal said that he escaped by the skin of teeth as the surging crowd invaded the field like a swarm of bees. It was scary but thrilling too.""

Asked how optimistic he is to expect a similar situation in future, he said, 'Whatever will be, will be.

""It's like Doris Day's famous song Que Sera Sera,"" he said with eyes shining.

HYDERABAD: A 32-year-old man was stabbed to death by a group of individuals in Kamatipura in the early hours of Sunday.

The accused persons, suspected to be known to the victim, fled from the spot. The deceased was identified as Syed Imran, a resident of Moinpura who was a scrap businessman.

According to police, the incident took place in Moinpura at 2.30 am. “The victim was allegedly stabbed by two to three persons, suspected to be known to him and from the same locality. The accused persons are suspected to have previous enmity with the victim,” said Kamatipura inspector, G Rambabu.

The accused persons are absconding and the police are checking the CCTV footage. “We suspect the accused called the victim at the spot on the pretext of settling a issue before stabbing him,” added the officer.

The victim sustained multiple stab injuries on his neck and chest. The victim was rushed to Osmania General Hospital and was declared brought dead. “We are checking the CCTV cameras but there are no signs of any person at the spot,” said the inspector. Police have registered a case under Sec-302 (murder) of IPC and relevant sections of Arms Act.

Foresters transport injured, deserted, orphaned and rescued animals to Mysuru Zoo, from as far as 100km or mor... Read More

MYSURU: With Mysuru zoo becoming the one stop for treatment of wild animals rescued from tiger reserves, sanctuaries and fringe villages near and far, an advance quarantine facility is being set up in Koorgalli to ensure effective treatment of the patients and to prevent infection of the captive animals at the zoo.

Over the last two years alone, the zoo has treated tigers, leopards, a slender loris and a muntjac (barking deer) from the wild. It also received a pair of foxes from the Raipur zoo in Chhattisgarh. One of the tigers received last year was captured after it mauled two farmers near Bandipur tiger reserve; another was a two-year-old caught in a snare in Nagarahole.

Zoo authorities said the quarantine facility and a postmortem centre would be established at the Chamundi Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre in Koorgalli. At present the foresters transport injured, deserted, orphaned and rescued animals to Mysuru Zoo, from as far as 100km or more. The animals are brought from Bandipur TR, Nagarahole TR, Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary, Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary, Brahmagiri, Pushpagiri, Talacauvery and Biligiri Ranganatha wildlife sanctuary, besides the fringe villages around these parks.

Veterinarians said the wild animals are accommodated in the inpatient wards in the zoo hospital as there is no separate shelter on the premises. Besides being an inconvenience, this brings with it the risk of transmission of diseases between the captive animals and the wild. ""We receive rescued elephant calves, gaur calves, leopard cubs, injured spotted deer, sambar, muntjac, bonnet macaques, bear cubs, tigers, leopards, jackals, freshwater muggers, snakes, starred tortoise, terrapins and many species of terrestrial and aquatic birds. They are treated and shifted to the Koorgalli centre,"" said a zoo official. ""But without an operation theatre and quarantine facility, it had become very difficult to conduct tests and monitor these rescued animals.""

Executive director of the zoo Ajit M Kulkarni said increased man-animal conflict was leading to an influx of captured and rescued animals. ""We did not have a proper postmortem facility at the centre and carcasses were brought to Mysuru zoo. As there is a clear risk of infection spreading to other animals, a scientific postmortem centre will be set up. The rescued animals will be treated and kept at the quarantine facility for observation after which they will be housed with the stock,"" he said. Adequate staff and veterinarians have been deputed for the new units in Koorgalli, he added.

NEW DELHI: Mornings were especially tough on Vimla in the cold wave that gripped Delhi this December. But by 7am every day, the 50-year-old would be at work, removing weeds around 'sherbet' roses of Mughal Gardens at Rashtrapati Bhavan . ""It was a difficult winter,"" she said, but she had to make sure the flowers endured.

Every February, just as the biting cold begins to yield, the Mughal Gardens open to the public as part of 'Udyanotsav'. Putting it together this year, the garden staff said, was the most difficult it has ever been. The day before 2019 ended was Delhi's coldest in 119 years. For weeks around that time, the weather was the city's only relevant subject of conversation. ""But we had to prepare. Opening of the gardens is an unbroken tradition. We covered the stalks with plastic and placed nets on the shrubs to prevent frost,"" said Ramesh Sharma, a 53-year-old senior gardener on the grounds.

The 42 garden staff members of the presidential residence did keep the tradition alive. The gardens open on February 5. The numbers are big - 15 acres, 138 varieties of roses, 5,000 dahlias, 10,000 tulips. The names are quirky - 'Mother Teresa' is a chrysanthemum and 'Red Pinocchio' is a rose, as is 'Delhi Princess'. A pale yellow-orange rose is 'President Pranab'. The American connect is strong and many rose shrubs are named after holidays - 'Memorial Day', 'Fourth of July' - or states like 'Oklahoma', 'Pasadena', 'Louisiana'. ""But that's just the rose federation,"" said PN Joshi, superintendent of the President's gardens, referring to the World Federation of Rose Societies .

Names have often sparked strange controversies. In 2014, a rose named 'Sonia' stirred a hornet's nest. That it was named not after the Congress politician but a rose cultivator from France didn't seem to matter much. The perceived symbolism did. A rose by any other name would, perhaps, have placated those who were incensed. Then, last December, a fringe outfit wanted the entire garden to be renamed. The demand was oblivious to history - that the charbagh Mughal gardens of Kashmir and the pleasure gardens of Europe had inspired Edward Lutyens, who designed this one over seven years.

""When (APJ Abdul) Kalam ji was President, he said he wanted a spiritual garden. Plants and trees significant to each religion - tulsi, henna, dates - were grown together in the garden as a symbol of unity. It's important to see the world like that,"" Joshi said.

Rashtrapati Bhavan had seven occupants in the 33 years Joshi has been around, tending to the gardens. Each President has brought something new - under Shankar Dayal Sharma , the garden went organic; KR Narayanan introduced a rainwater catchment system and Kalam brought in a herb garden with indigenous plants.

Earlier, the first Indian resident of the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the first governor general of independent India, C Rajagopalachari, had subverted the opulence of the gardens at a time when the country was facing a food crisis and sectioned off an area for wheat cultivation. ""The practice continued till 1962, under our first President Rajendra Prasad . There's a lot to the history of this place,"" said Kumar Samresh, public relations officer of the President's secretariat.

The latest tender for the Film City redevelopment project has drastically slashed the fee to be paid to the government by private entities to convert the prime land into a filmmaking and tourism hub like Universal Studios. The tender asks private parties to pay an initial annual fee of just Rs 20 crore besides revenue share for the right to develop 211 acres over a 40-year period, TOI found. The first tender, which failed to attract bids, had pegged the annual fee at 128.5 crore, to escalate each year. The new fee is over six times lower.In real terms, the successful bidder will control around 400 acres of the state-owned Film City’s land in Goregaon , of which only 211 acres will be buildable, officials say. Portions of the rest can be given over to activities like film shoots. Both tenders were introduced when the BJP-led government was in power in the state during 2014-19. The first tender was floated in July 2018. The second was introduced in August 2019. The last day for receiving bids is February 7.The project will operate on a Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) basis. During the 40-year license period, the private entity will have control over the project and pay the state an annual “concession fee” and a share of the revenue generated from the project. The license period can be extended by another ten years.The first tender listed an initial fee of Rs 128.5 crore to be paid to the state and to escalate by 5% each year to reach Rs 1,147 crore in the 40th year. If extended by another 10 years, the fee would be Rs 1,868 crore in the 50th year.In the latest tender, a potential developer is expected to pay the state just Rs 20 crore for the first year. The rest of the fee for the 40-year span will be linked to a price index which has not been revealed in the tender.The Rs 2,550 crore project has two components. The mandatory portion includes the creation of filmmaking infrastructure, including sound stages and special effects studios, a Bollywood theme park and museum, hotels and a convention centre. The project also has a commercial component, which allows the developer flexibility to build retail shops, a commercial hub, club and stadium. The value of this has not been estimated.After the discount on the concession fee, there are voices of concern within the government about whether the state is giving prime land to the developer for a pittance. Especially since the project will also remain within the control of the private entity for 40 years.However, officials say the concession fee was reduced after potential bidders felt it was too high. “The idea was to reduce the concession fee in order to avail of a higher revenuesharing agreement,” said a senior official from Maharashtra Film, Stage and Cultural Development Corporation, which manages Film City.Officials say the old fee was linked to the land’s lease rent after taking the ready reckoner into account. However, the new fee is linked to the revenue currently being earned from the property. “The profit being earned by Film City comes to around Rs 17 crore annually. So, the concession fee was fixed for Rs 20 crore for the base year,” the official said.The second tender appears to have increased the amount of land that can be accessed by the private player. The first tender says the project will be limited to 211 acres of buildable land. However, the second tender says the development of Film City will be spread over the 211 acres buildable area or on any other potion of its land once approved by the government, except for the reserved forest area.Officials clarified that the private player will control around 400 acres, of which only 211acres will be buildable. “The land around the buildable area is contiguous, so, it will be in the control of the party that wins the bid. As no development can take place there, it can only be given for activities like film shoots,” said a senior official. Since the government will receive a revenue share, the private entity will not pay extra fee for renting out nonbuildable land, the official said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73890707,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-906659,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-film-city-tender-slashes-developers-fee-to-be-paid-to-government-from-rs-128-crore-to-rs-20-crore/articleshow/73890649.cms

347,['3/02/2020'],Punjab allows traders to tie up with small general stores to sell foreign liquor,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Photo used for representational purpose only

CHANDIGARH: To increase the availability of imported liquor in the state, the Punjab government has allowed liquor traders to tie up with small general stores to sell foreign liquor, the licence (L2B) for which was earlier given only to departmental stores.

The provision for granting L2B licence - retail sale of imported foreign liquor - has been relaxed in the new excise policy which will come into force from April 1. Under the new norms, an L2 licencee - wholesale and retail vendor of foreign liquor - has been allowed to get a licence to sell foreign liquor at any general store after entering into an agreement with such a store.

The minimum covered area of the store should be 400 square feet and it should be dealing in any four items, including grocery items, frozen goods, sugar and bakery items, toiletries, cosmetics, household goods, toys, sports goods, electronics, apparels, office stationery, gift items and any other household goods.

The condition of minimum guaranteed quota for this licence has also been done away with. In the present policy, 2,700 proof litres (PL) is the minimum quota of imported foreign liquor which the licence holders are required to lift compulsorily. In case quota is not lifted, licencees are required to pay Rs 330 per PL as assessed fee.

The annual licence fee has also been brought down from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. For operating this licence, the licencee will have to utilise up to 25% of covered area of the store for display of liquor which will be supplied from L2 licence with approval of collector. The annual good and services tax (GST) turnover/supply of the store of the last year should be minimum of Rs 1 crore, which is same as in current policy.

The L1 (imported liquor) licence fee has also been cut from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 10 lakh. Taking a dig at the state government, leader of the opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said on one hand the government was running Tandrust Mission Punjab to keep people of the state, especially youth, healthy, but on the other hand it was allowing sale of liquor at general stores. ""The move will give youngsters easy access to alcohol. The government should remove the clause,"" said Cheema.

BENGALURU: A city businessman who was arrested after his firm was allegedly found exporting 30kg of methaqualone, a sedative-hypnotic drug whose effect is like barbiturates, was acquitted after a special court gave him the benefit of doubt.

The prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the court said. The seized drugs are said to be worth Rs 12 crore.

Special judge GM Sheenappa cited lack of corroborated evidence and discrepancies in the prosecution witnesses while acquitting Arun V, proprietor of Integrated Corporation, Prakash Nagar, Bengaluru.

The prosecution's case was that, on October 13, 2016, officers on duty at the Air India SATS export shed found off-white powder in plastic tubes in non-woven shopping bags which were to be exported by Integrated Corporation.

On testing, the powder turned out to be positive for methaqualone, a controlled substance under the NDPS Act, 1985.

Arun, was arrested the next day. He spent more than six months in jail and got bail on May 9, 2017.

349,['3/02/2020'],Subarban Rail Project: Will suburban rail reach Bengaluru airport ahead of Namma Metro?,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Kempegowda International Airport

BENGALURU: In a huge boost to air passengers, priority corridor of the Bengaluru suburban rail project to the Kempegowda International Airport ( KIA ) is likely to be operational by August 2022, according to Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises’ ( K-RIDE ) current plan.

On Sunday, the SPV which is executing the suburban rail project unveiled the 148km suburban rail project with four corridors: KSR Bengaluru City -Devanahalli, Byappanahalli-Chikkabanavara, Kengeri-Cantonment-Whitefield and Heelalige-Rajanukunte.

While finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the project at a cost of Rs 18,600 crore in the budget on Saturday, it is yet to receive a nod from the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).

In 2019 alone, KIA saw 33.65 million passengers. According to K-RIDE, the KSR Bengaluru City-Yelahanka- KIA- Devanahalli (41.4km) line is likely to be operational by August 15, 2022. K-RIDE said work will be taken up on priority and the line will have 14 stations. It will be built at an estimated cost of Rs 5,127 crore and will provide direct connectivity to the terminal.

In contrast, the Rs 10,584 crore Silk Board-KR Puram (ORR)-KIA Metro corridor project which is yet to be approved by the Centre, is scheduled to open only in 2024. BMRCL in December invited tenders for the ORR line, while tenders for KR Puram-KIA section are likely to be floated by this month end. Going by the pace of work, Metro’s deadline may further get delayed, however, officials maintains that majority of the land acquisitions have been completed and have also commenced soil testing along the corridor.

Moreover, suburban rail could provide cheaper and quicker connectivity to KIA than the Metro since airport passengers from the central business district and south Bengaluru opting for the Metro will have to change trains to get to KIA.

The suburban rail system is also likely to get Metro-like facilities. Sources said 53 air-conditioned suburban trains with automated double-leaf sliding doors will be deployed in the first phase. Automated fare collection (AFC) gates at stations will enable smart card-based cashless travel for suburban rail users.

Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday said work on Bengaluru’s suburban rail project will be taken up on priority and will be completed within three years. While unveiling a detailed plan on the four-corridor 148km project on Sunday, K-RIDE revealed it would take six years to complete the project.

Meanwhile, a halt railway station — between Doddajala and Devanahalli railway stations — will be ready by February-end, bringing relief to airport-bound passengers. The proposed halt station will be close to the airport boundary and 2-3km away from the terminal. Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) is building the halt station and also operates shuttle services between the station and terminal. An online petition launched by Rajkumar Dugar titled 'Bengaluru needs trains to airport - and fast' has got more than 12,650 signatures so far.

Madras high court

MADURAI: Madras high court has directed the state government to reinstate a staff nurse who was terminated from service following a maternal death at a primary health centre (PHC) in Tirunelveli , saying she was made a scape goat without conducting a proper inquiry.

Petitioner T Blessie moved the HC Madurai bench in 2011 seeking to quash the termination order passed by the director of medical and rural health services dated July 23 that year and reinstate her. Her counsel stated that on April 24, 2009, a woman named Kannuthai delivered a baby girl at the Ukkirankottai PHC where the nurse was employed on contract. However, the woman developed a complication following which duty doctor Padma shifted her to the Tirunelveli medical college hospital where she died after two hours.

The petitioner was subsequently transferred to three PHCs within 27 months. On June 10, 2011, Tirunelveli deputy director of health services instructed her to sign a pre-written paper without allowing her to read it. The counsel submitted that on July 23 the termination order was passed on the charge that it was dereliction of duty on her part which resulted in the maternal death. When the nurse had discharged the duties on the instructions of the duty doctor, she alone had been punished, which was a discrimination. He stated that the order was passed without providing an opportunity to the petitioner to explain. The government advocate submitted that based on the representation given by the mother of the deceased woman, an inquiry was conducted and departmental proceedings initiated against Blessie, Padma and block medical officer Dr Sivagami Ebinezer.

The deputy director on completion of oral inquiry held the petitioner responsible for the death as she had not written the details on the case sheet, administered methergine injection before separation of placenta against protocol, did not administer an injection (syntocinon) and had not given proper treatment during the referral. On perusal of the submissions, Justice J Nisha Banu observed that the authorities concerned have straightaway passed the termination order without issuing charge-memo and without conducting any departmental inquiry in violation of Article 311(2) of the Constitution.

The state health department took samples of four more persons with suspected symptoms of the deadly viral disease on Saturday. These persons include two from Panchkula, one each from Gurgaon and Karnal.

The department officials said the ones from Panchkula have travel history from Wuhan, while the other two were found to be symptomatic anyhow.

""The samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune for testing. The Panipat resident whose sample was sent to NIV on January 31 has tested negative,"" a health official said.

In a bid to intensify the screening, the state health department has also set up special check posts on the national highways connecting to Delhi.

Besides this, hospitals have been provided with self-declaration forms for the persons who volunteer for screening for coronavirus.

Representative image

MUMBAI: Reprimanding a Thane-based housing society for being ""hand in glove"" with a builder in ""mentally harassing"" a flat owner to extract excess money, the state consumer commissioner has ordered it, its office bearers and the builder to pay Rs 5.5 lakh as compensation to the family. The builder will also have to pay the family Rs 14.4 lakh as compensation for delay in handing over their flat.

The flat's owner, Kishor Narkhede, had alleged that the society refused to give him a share certificate, demanded excessive money and prevented the family from peacefully using their flat and parking lot. He said the society filed false criminal complaints against him and his family.

Penalising the society's chairman, secretary, ex-secretary, treasurer, and some members, the commission said, ""A society once formed, cannot be justified to act unlawfully in connivance with the builder and other members to pick and choose a flat purchaser to collectively harass him to knock out ransom or subjecting him to illegal demands and frivolous, false and vexatious prosecution.""

In a complaint submitted online last year, Narkhade told the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission that he bought the 865-sqft flat in Ganraj Heights from Ganraj Group for Rs 36 lakh in 2011. He received possession only in 2018.

In its order, the commission directed the society to induct the owner as a member and not interfere in the family's possession of the flat and parking space. ""Ganraj Height CHS shall issue share certificate of the society in favour of the complainants without demanding any illegal payments. Demand of payment, if any, shall be made in writing and payment, when made, shall be acknowledged by a valid receipt in writing,"" the commission said.

Narkhade told the commission that in a bid to grab the parking lot he had already paid for, the housing society in connivance with the builder and members named in the complaint had begun passing resolutions against him in his absence. Stating that the housing society should conduct its affairs and financial aspects transparently, the commission said, ""Each flat purchaser shall be informed in writing to participate in meetings to pass valid and legal resolutions to maintain the building in a habitable condition. The society can never be permitted to act in collusion with any ill-motivated selfish flat purchaser or builder intending to grab property so as to continuously harass the complainants, mentally or physically.""

HYDERABAD: A vaccination drive was conducted for over 500 traffic police personnel at CAR, Police Headquarters, Amberpet, on Sunday.

The purpose of the vaccination drive was to help traffic police, who are at risk and spend odd hours on the field to immunize them against typhoid infection. Despite honest efforts from the department, many times they end up having no access to safe water and food, while on duty. This puts them at risk for typhoid.

Speaking after inaugurating the drive, Rachakonda deputy commissioner of police, LB Nagar, Sunpreet Singh said, “This is a great initiative. With the help of Bharat Biotech, United Ways of Hyderabad and Nice Foundation , we vaccinated over 500 Rachakonda police staff. When our policemen are at work, they may consume contaminated water or food and are prone to typhoid, I am happy they are now immunized against typhoid infection.” He also divulged that he was twice infected with typhoid.

Sumit Nagal. (TOI Photo)

PUNE: Prajnesh Gunneswaran and Sumit Nagal will carry the nation's hopes when they walk out on the Centre Court in the $610,000 Tata Open Maharashtra, starting at Mhalunge-Balewadi sports complex here on Monday.

While the expectations on Gunneswaran might be a tad less, as he had been recovering from a wrist injury, it will be a completely different story with Nagal. The 22-yearold, ranked131, did not feature even in qualifying last year while he lost in the first round as a qualifier in 2018. This time, however, the Haryanvi can be sure that the crowd will be rooting for him.

""I would say there is a bit of pressure, but in a good way,"" said Nagal, who faces Serbian Viktor Troicki in the third match on centre court on Monday. Troicki, a former world No. 12 now ranked 159, came through the qualifying round. ""Having pressure, having the Indian people behind me, hoping to do well is a good thing. I like the spotlight.""

Nagal, though, is aware that it's only the start of the year and he has a lot of work to do. He acknowledged that his best performances, apart from the US Open first round clash against Roger Federer, had come on clay last year, and that he needed to do well on hard to go further up ladder. ""I need to improve on hard court. I can't just keep playing on one surface,"" he said. ""That is one of the goals we have set, try to be more comfortable on hard court.""

And he knows which areas of his game need attention. ""Serve matters a lot on clay. You can get by with the kick serve. On hard court it is important with the serve and the first shot,"" he said.

""That is where I think if I start doing better, it will start to have an impact not only on hard, but on clay as well.

""So there is stuff like getting used to coming to the net because you want the points to be shorter.""

Gunneswaran, who's opener against German Yannick Maden is set for Tuesday, will feel confident after a rigorous practice match against Italian Thomas Fabbiano when his groundstrokes seemed to flow fluently. Ramkumar Ramanathan is another home lad who would be keen to impress his fans and prove his pundits wrong.

The red-breasted flycatcher

MUMBAI: With over 300 avid birdwatchers waking up at daybreak to participate in the annual Mumbai BirdRace on Sunday, the event got off to a flying start in the city and surrounding regions of Thane, Navi Mumbai, Raigad.

“The presence of bird species is an indicator of a region’s biodiversity. This year, once more, we got great response to the Mumbai BirdRace as birders visited areas like Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Karnala Bird Sanctuary, the wetlands at Sewree, Airoli, Bhandup and Uran, among others,” said veteran naturalist and core team member, Sunjoy Monga.

Sponsored by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd (HSBC) and co-sponsored by Tata Chemicals and Nikon, the city’s enthusiastic birding community spoke about how rampant ‘development’ in green zones had affected the number of species spotted.

The assistant director of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), Raju Kasambe, said, “At Uran, where wetlands have diminished over the years, the number of bird species spotted have also come down. But I am happy to see youngsters and even school children show a keen interest in birds and in the environment.”

Another birder, Kunal Munsiff, said, “Our team visited Tungareshwar forest where we saw the red-breasted flycatcher, racket-tailed drongo and golden oriole and heard the call of the jungle owlet.”

Paediatrician, Dr Salil Choksi, said, “Due to rampant development, finding birding areas in Mumbai has become challenging. We went to Karnala, near Panvel, where we saw the forest wagtail, taiga flycatcher and green pigeon. Later, at the Dombivali Bhopar scrubland, we saw over 50 bird species. If towers are erected here tomorrow, all the birds will disappear.”

“Statistics show the bird species in Uran has gone down in the past 15 years during the BirdRaces. Though we do not claim to do any precise scientific study, our figures show something is wrong with Uran region,” said Monga.

CHANDIGARH: More than nine years after the registration of an FIR in the controversial theme-cum-amusement park project, the UT administration has decided to revive the plan, with Punjab governor cum-UT administrator V P Singh Badnore directing officials to look for 40 acres of land.“There were some issues in the past. But this time, the administration will start the project with complete transparency. We will go for international bidding. The project will be beneficial for the city. It will also boost tourism. Land will not be a major problem,” Badnore said while interacting with mediapersons at Chandigarh Press Club on Sunday.The FIR was registered on October 4, 2010, stating that the former top officials of the UT in connivance with Unitech Limited indulged in a criminal conspiracy and awarded 73.65 acres of land in Sarangpur to Unitech for a Rs 5.5-crore fixed annual licence fee and on 1.1% annual revenue sharing basis. It was alleged the administration ignored financial rules while inviting tenders and shortlisting companies. The officers had allegedly ‘ignored’ the highest bidder, DLF, and allotted the project to Unitech.A special CBI court had issued fresh summons to the then UT adviser, Lalit Sharma, then home secretary Krishan Mohan and then director, tourism, Vivek Atray and Unitech Limited director Ajay Chandra under Sections 120 B, 420, 201 of IPC and Section 13(1)d and section 13(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act. This after a CBI court had rejected the third closure report in the scam. The CBI had earlier moved two closure reports in the case, but the court had rejected both, mentioning further investigation should be conducted in the matter. The special CBI court had a few days back granted bail to three former IAS officers in the case on furnishing bail bonds of Rs 1lakh each.The central vigilance commission (CVC) was the first investigating agency to look into the financial irregularities in the project. The case was later shifted to the CBI.

365,['3/02/2020'],"49,000 flats of over Rs 1.5 crore left unsold in Mumbai","This story is from February 3, 2020

BENGALURU: For at least the third consecutive year, the luxury housing market was the worst performing segment in residential sales.

Data from property consultancy Anarock show that unsold luxury stock (homes priced at Rs 1.5 crore and more), rose 10% to 89,200 units in 2019 in the top 7 cities, compared to the year before. The value of such stock is estimated to be about Rs 1.6 lakh crore ($22 billion), which is 34% of total unsold inventory.

Mumbai’s unsold luxury stock stood at 48,970 units, New Delhi’s 18,400 units and Bengaluru’s 7,470 units. These three cities contributed the most to the leftover inventory. Projects in south and central Mumbai, one of the most expensive micro markets, have dried up as buyers of luxury homes prefer ready-tomove-in projects.

The uncertainty and slowness in the economy and a glut of unsold stock has also prevented a price rise in the segment, which was the major reason that drew investors between 2006 and 2010. The market was also badly impacted by demonetisation, which brought cash transactions to a sudden halt.

“There is hardly any movement in the category over Rs 1.5 crore,” Ravindra Pai, managing director of Century Real Estate, said. “We have one project in the CBD area, which has about 36 apartments at a price bracket of Rs 5 crore. While 80% is sold, we have not sold anything in the last one and half years. We are only focusing on commercial, plotted and mid-segment,” he said.

While luxury apartments comprise one-third of the value of total unsold stock, it contributes only 14% to the volumes. Developers have severely curtailed the supply due to lack of interest in the segment. A Brigade Estates executive said that the company has seen some traction in ready-to-move-in luxury properties compared to under construction ones. “While we have launched a project in Chennai where the apartments cost Rs 2 crore each, there is nothing planned in Bengaluru for the future,” he said.

Pankaj Kapoor, CEO of real estate analytics company Liases Foras, said the category gained popularity between 2006 and 2008 due to the rise of millionaires but came crashing post the financial crisis. “The segment became absolutely irrational due to the high prices after that. Also, many builders in Mumbai built costly apartments in areas which were surrounded by slums. Buyers paying a fortune demand something special and exclusive,” he said.

That’s the question Vikram Bhatt ’s next, 'Hacked', tries to answer. The filmmaker said that he was closely watching Wikileaks, the Julian Assange-founded organisation that publishes news leaks and classified media, and Edward Snowden’s account of flying to Hong Kong and staying at a Russian transit lounge for 40 days, struck a chord.“Six years ago, my laptop was hacked and with that, so were my social media accounts. I was being notified about friend requests being accepted when I hadn’t sent any, but the scatterbrain that I am, I assumed I may have mistakenly sent them, till a friend pinged me to ask why was I chatting with him on FB messenger when I had his number,” he recounts, adding that he had to change the operating and security systems to deal with the menace.But that hasn’t helped. On Sunday, Vikram was forced to deactivate his Facebook account again, after he learnt that someone had got through his two-step verification and hacked in. On Instagram, he warned followers that “this is not me”. “We allow people to hack into our lives, it just takes a little knowledge of technology,” he sighs.Prod him on how hacking happens, and he explains that when we download an app or software on our phone, it asks permission to access our camera, mic, photo gallery and contacts and we click on ‘I agree’ without hesitation. Similarly, we accept cookies from a website without reading terms and conditions. “Even WhatsApp, though only a messaging service, monitors where you are and Google uses it to update its maps,” he cautions, adding that Snowden now removes the mic every time he buys a new phone, attaching an external mic to make calls.But isn’t the cyber cell created to deal with such miscreants? “How much can they control?” Vikram asks, pointing out that hackers have wormed their way into the websites of big companies with firewalls. “They keep inventing newer trojans and viruses.”In his film, 19-year-old Rohan Shah plays the antagonist and Vikram informs that’s the average age of a hacker. “These kids mature faster because power corrupts,” he says, drawing parallels between his character and the delinquents who hacked into Amitabh Bachchan ’s Twitter to put up a Pakistani flag there. “It was their way of saying that despite all the security, we got into Amit ji’s house, shook hands with him, and you couldn’t touch us.”'Hacked' will come up against Mohit Suri ’s star-studded ' Malang ' but Vikram is unfazed. “Mohit was my assistant and learnt filmmaking from me. I sent him a message, saying that both of us should pop champagne together on February 7,” he smiles, revealing that he plans to take a sabbatical now. “I’ve been working for 39 years, since I was 14, starting a film while another was still in the theatres. I missed the bus on my youth. My daughter, Krishna, is 25 and may get married soon. My parents are getting old. I want to spend as much time as I can with them. I’ll focus on writing for a while and write a script for my daughter to direct.”Will it be in the horror space? He laughs, “I go to people with a love story and they ask for a horror story. First you make a brand, then, the brand follows you. Fortunately, Krishna wants to do a love story as she doesn’t want to be compared to her papa.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73891511,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-545233/73891511.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/vikram-bhatt-we-allow-people-to-hack-into-our-lives/articleshow/73891263.cms

HYDERABAD: In a battle to avoid the wooden spoon, Hyderabad Hunters downed Mumbai Rockets 4-3 in the Premier Badminton League match here on Sunday.

But the inconsequential tie became the perfect stage for the launch of another promising shuttler, Priyanshu Rajawat. The 18-year-old, representing Hunters, stunned world No.49 Lee Dong Keun of Korea 15-13, 15-9. Ranked No.284 in the world, the sprightly teen displayed superb skills near the net and away from it in equal measure. The manner in which he executed the half smashes and crosscourt pushes were a delight to watch. The fans, who had come to watch PV Sindhu , left home chanting the name of Priyanshu.

Even while engaging his rival in long rallies, Priyanshu never lost his composure and negotiated the tough situations with ease.

Meanwhile, Hunters' semifinal hopes, which were hanging by a thread, have effectively ended as they secured only four points from the tie. Both Hunters and Rockets are at the bottom of the table with 10 points each.

Earlier, the home team got off to a disastrous start as its men's doubles pair of Vladimir Ivanov and Ben Lane went down without a fight against Kim Gi Jung and Kim Sa Rang of Mumbai 10-15, 8-15. The Koreans, who won bronze at the World Championships twice, were too good for the Anglo-Russian pair of Lane and Ivanov. The Hunters' duo was in the game only up to the 7th point in both the games.

Rockets' skipper Parupalli Kashyap struck form after losing three matches on trot to beat Daren Liew. With Kashyap winning the trump 15-8, 15-13, Mumbai secured a 3-0 lead. Sindhu then won the trump match to revive Hunters' hopes before Priyanshu made it 3-3 for the home team. Sindhu hardly broke any sweat as she dismissed Shreyanshi Pardeshi in two games 15-5, 15-10.

""Some sub-committees have compiled their reports and they will be discussed in the advisory council meeting next month,"" Badnore said. ""Chandigarh's per capita income is very high. People roam around in expensive cars but many feel parking charges should be Rs 5.

As numbers continue to rise, estimates suggest that more than 17,000 people have been infected with the viral strain, as more and more countries impose travel bans and restrictions. The deadly infection has now been declared a worldwide public health emergency by the World Health Organisation.Thailand, which has recorded the second-highest number of cases of the rampant infection (18) after China has been seeing a good potential recovery rate, with doctors reporting success rates in treating patients infected with the disease.According to a statement issued by Thailand's health ministry, a woman of Chinese origin, admitted to a hospital in Bangkok has shown surprising improvement and recovery rate after the doctors attending to her case administered a mix of medicines, largely anti-viral drugs mainly used to treat infections like the Flu and the HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus).According to the report released, doctors involved in the case administered a combination of drugs, including oseltamivir with lopinavir and ritonavir to the patient which has shown ""speedy"" results. The research is still to be published.According to inputs from AFP, the woman, who recorded the same symptoms as of other patients, like exhaustion, tiredness and flu was able to rest and sit up properly after the dose was given to her.The patient, who is 71 years old tested negative for Coronavirus infection, nearly 48 hours after the first dose of the combination medicines were given to her. If this news is true, this might be the much-needed breakthrough needed to crack the Coronavirus outbreak , which is now fast spreading around the world. Till date, a total of 362 people have lost their lives due to the virus, including a 44-year-old who died in the Philippines, which makes it the first death to happen outside of China, the area of primary attack.In India, two people in Kerala who travelled back to the country from China have so far tested positive for the virus and are undergoing quarantine and getting necessary treatment for the same.Apart from this, many new researchers are underway to find a fast and effective cure for the virus outbreak which started in December 2019.

Bihar deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi

PATNA: Bihar deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Sunday said of the Rs 408 crore allocated by the 15th Finance Commission for Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), Rs 204 crore would be spent on improving air quality in the city.

Modi said Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget on Saturday, had noted that the Centre accepted the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission headed by N K Singh for the 2020-21 fiscal as to the states' share in the central pool of taxes.

Further, half of this sum or Rs 204 crore would be spent on improving air quality in Patna. The remaining Rs 204 crore would be spent on safe drinking water and solid waste management. All other local urban bodies in the state will share the allocation worth Rs 2,008 crore.

BENGALURU: Some 15,000 midday meal (bisioota) workers have threatened to launch an indefinite protest here on Monday even as police imposed ban orders under section 144 and threatened to arrest them on arrival at KSR City railway station.

While the workers had sought permission to hold their protest at Freedom Park, cops feared since the venue won't be able to accommodate so many people, the protesters would pitch camp on adjoining Seshadri Road.

Police commissioner Bhaskar Rao cited traffic issues, law and order and lack of infrastructure such as toilets for women while denying their request and imposed ban orders on Sunday evening. S Varalakshmi, president, Karnataka State Midday Meal Workers Association described the police action as undemocratic.

According to police, 15,000-20,000 workers are expected to reach Bengaluru on Monday, many of them by train. Police will deploy additional forces at KSR City station to prevent them from entering Seshadri Road.

The workers are demanding hike in remuneration and fixation of minimum monthly wages. Currently, cooks get Rs 2,700 every month and their helpers Rs 2,600.

Yogendra Yadav

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The country is presently going through an unforeseen movement, a movement to unite the people. When the BJP-led Union government wants to divide the people, “our responsibility is to unite the people”, said psephologist and politician-activist Yogendra Yadav .

“The implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) is unprecedented in the country and we never expected a Union government to divide people in the name of religion,” said Yadav, who was in the city to campaign against CAA.

“This move by the Centre has united the people the same way we stood up for our freedom struggle. The protest has become a national movement of unity. This is the first time that strong protests have taken place, especially by students and youths,” he said, while participating at the meet-the -press programme organised by Kerala Union of Working Journalists.

Yadav is of the opinion that the main purpose of implementing CAA is to classify people in the country as firstand second-grade citizens. “The CAA is not for taking the citizenship away from citizens. But it is to create two categories of people in the country. So the Centre is trying to signal the people about this classification. The combination of CAA, NRC and NPR is a deadly weapon,” Yadav said.

There is enormous pressure on the national media and judiciary to suppress anti-CAA protests. But Kerala is an exception. He also appreciated the state government for its resolution against CAA.

Yadav clarified that he was not interested in Delhi elections and his focus is on anti-CAA campaign. “But one thing is for sure, BJP is losing and they are trying to trigger communalism in Delhi as they are now desperate to win,” Yadav said.

He flayed the Union Budget as a declaration of war on farmers. “The Union finance minister said in the budget speech that the government has proposed 40 points to improve the agriculture sector in the country. However, she had not allocated a single paisa for these projects. When I read the budget allocations, none of the farming sectors has got good allocations. So it was just an eyewash by the minister,” Yadav said.

378,['3/02/2020'],Many sanctioned posts of officials in Patna University lying vacant,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Patna University

PATNA: Even as almost all the sanctioned posts of Patna University officials are lying vacant for the last several years (in some cases, decades), no sincere efforts have been made by the authorities concerned to fill up these posts on regular basis.

The university has been allowed to run on an ad hoc arrangement all these years. The erstwhile Bihar State University (Constituent Colleges) Service Commission or the Bihar Public Service Commission never bothered to make appointment against all these vacant posts.

The office of the registrar fell vacant after the transfer of last regularly appointed registrar Vibhas Kumar Yadav to Veer Kunwar Singh University more than a decade back. Quite recently, Colonel Manoj Kumar Mishra was appointed as registrar by then governor-cum-chancellor Satya Pal Malik. Earlier, PU zoology department former head Sudhir Kumar Srivastava and Hindi department former head Balram Tiwari had served as the registrar for some time.

PU assistant registrar N Zaman was promoted as deputy registrar. He also officiated as the proctor of PU for a brief period until Patna Science College chemistry teacher Rajnish Kumar was appointed on the post. There are two sanctioned posts of assistant registrars, but both are lying vacant.

The university has not got a regular controller of examinations for the last three decades following the superannuation of S A Imam. Senior teachers of the university have been officiating as the controller of examinations all these years. Patna Science College botany department teacher R K Mandal has been acting as the examination controller at present.

The post of finance officer is also lying vacant for the last 25 years as no regular appointment has been made against the post after the retirement of J D Chaudhary.

The post of university engineer fell vacant in 1985 following the retirement of P K Mukherjee, but no regular appointment has been made against this post. As many as four out of seven posts of assistant engineers are also lying vacant. Besides, only three assistant engineers are working against 20 sanctioned posts.

Worst is the condition of PU Central Library which has not a single regularly appointed official. Patna Science College geology department teacher Rabindra Kumar is presently serving as the library incharge. The posts of university librarian, seven assistant librarians, two research assistants, one classifier and cataloguer and three non-professional assistants are all lying vacant for the last several years.

The last regularly appointed chief medical officer of the university, Vijayee Singh, retired more than two decades ago and since then the PU Central Dispensary is being managed on an ad hoc basis. As many as five posts of medical officers are lying vacant.

The post of development officer was created in 1967, but no regular appointment has since been made against this post. PU zoology department teacher P K Khan has been officiating as the development officer at present. PU applied economics and commerce department teacher Ashim Lal Chakravorty has been officiating as the budget-cum-accounts officer of the university following the retirement of Ganeshwar Pradhan some years back.

Even the class III and IV posts in most colleges and postgraduate departments have fallen vacant. More than a couple of years ago, the state government had announced that class III and IV staff would now be outsourced in the colleges and universities. But, only a few staff could be provided to some institutions till date, even as most departments and colleges are facing acute shortage of secretarial staff.

Of late, PU has made a move to appoint class III and IV staff against sanctioned posts through an open advertisement to ensure smooth conduct of academic activities in all the institutions, said vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh. But nobody knows as to when PU will get regularly appointed officers to manage its work smoothly.

Palakkad-based farmer James P Mathew has been making wine from jackfruit

PALAKKAD: Farmers have welcomed the statement of excise minister T P Ramakrishnan that steps were being taken by the government to start a winery at Malabar Distilleries of the now defunct Chittur Cooperative Sugars Ltd in the district.

During the inaugural of excise tower complex here on Saturday, minister for water resources K Krishnankutty, a leading farmer, reminded the excise minister about the Cabinet decision in October last year on making wine at Malabar Distilleries to help farmers. The excise minister replied that after the ongoing Assembly session, steps will be intensified to start production of low-alcoholic wine from fruits and vegetables in Palakkad and the state as a whole.

Muthalamthode Mani, general secretary, Desheeya Karshaka collective, said, “Allowing wine making from fruits such as jackfruit, pineapple, bananas, mango, orange, grapes and tender coconut will help the farmers in fetching good price for their products.”

Mani said mango farmers of Muthalamada Mango City have been hit due to late flowering of the plants due to climate change. Muthalamada mango used to hit the international market early in January. But this season, the mango production was late by more than oneand-a half months. Because of this, mango farmers will not get good price for their product which used to be exported.

Irumpakachola Farmers Club at Kanjirapuzha in Mannarkkad headed by James P Mathew, a jackfruit farmer popularly called ‘jackfruit man’, said “If wine is commercially made, it will help jackfruit farmers to get at least Rs 300 per fruit which is wasted in the state in a criminal way during every season.”

The audience is loving the hot new romantic song, the cute and the chocolate boy charm of Shantanu which is very refreshing to see.While the song is about cute love at first sight instances of a guy and a girl falling in love at an Indian wedding, it has a really beautiful ethnic touch being shot in the beautiful place Jaipur which gives it a proper desi wedding feel.In an exclusive conversation with Shantanu, Ash and Bharat for the song we got in touch with them for a candid interview and here are the excerpts from the interview:: Actually the song was conceived by Bharat Goel and Siddhant Kaushal , they were attending a wedding together and they had a concept, now we have Bharat right here to explain the story.: So Siddhant Kaushal writer of the song, Siddhant and I were at this wedding and the couple was really sweet so we looked at the couple and you know and we had that feeling you know ‘’, that’s when we decided it’s funny there’s no song on that so there must be a song and that’s how the song was born. And then of course we jammed in the studio, came up with the idea, brainstorm in the studio and of course when we were deciding who should sing the song we unanimously agreed on Ash, of course we didn’t have the budget for Arijit Singh (laughs), so that’s when we got in touch with Ash and Ash did a phenomenal job, really happy with how it’s sounding now.: I would love to work with different kind of genres but, for me I know people expect me to dance whichever music video I come, so I mean for me it was very different. It had a romantic vibe something even which I like to that like a Hero. The composition was such that I fell in love with the song when I did when I heard it for the first time; Ash had sung this song so I was like ‘Wow’, so it just happened, not like we wanted it, but not like we have a problem with it (laughs). I got an offer so I was like why not. The vibe of the song is so cool.So I mean Reecha is the one who’s playing the female lead. There’s no ‘preparation’ that I had to do but I mean just to make each other comfortable so that we can react in a proper manner. We started meeting before to rehearse a few initial choreographies so that we are comfortable with each other. In underwater especially there were intimate moments so that we had to be comfortable and then you have to control your breathing, you have to coordinate with each other.It was very challenging because to move underwater, choreographing becomes very difficult to coordinate with the DOP as well so that he gets the proper shots and breathing in the same time. So I mean it was difficult it was challenging but we knew that the director was pretty much sure about the sequence she wanted and I mean we had to do justice to the song.Yeah every actor does intent to work in movies.As I said it’s very challenging the whole thing toh,I can’t save someone else I can just save myself toh I mean it happened in the moment and I saved her.I think Ash has experienced that a lot(laughs): I didn’t make the song, I just sung the song. But the writer and the composer of the song are quiet romantic at heart. So I think Bharat can explain you further.Bharat: So ‘’ is a feeling you know could be triggered by anything when someone is sweet to you or you go through these sweet experiences. It doesn’t have to necessarily be relationships or love it could be for example a small child or someone in the family. Like when your mother makes some delicious food for you it can be ‘’. With this song the attempt was to capture that feeling. It’s not necessarily a romantic love story however in the video when I saw the video I was really impressed because here’s the thing it’s a big challenge to bring out and consistently without making it look forced and I think every aspect of the video, the story, the script, the writing and the beautiful locations and the way they executed it and the sheer passion I think the entire team had in this project, I mean they put Shantanu and Reecha underwater that tells you how passionate they were about the whole project.Shantanu: Also the fact that the when you listen to the song it’s very simple, it connects to you, seems like you feel very romantic. It has that vibe to it and to incorporate that old school vibe that’s what we were looking at in terms of the video and old school it’s like when you’re at weddings. I come from that old school thought that you know, so that kind of cuteness that lost feeling is what I feel is people do not experience that, I think that is the video that it shows like it’s still there.: I think Bharat has been a DJ so he should say this.: So the funny thing is as a DJ I used to do a lot of remixes, it’s funny I started my career with remixes and remakes.He has no issue with remixes.: No, not at all. I think as a producer when I hear timeless melodies that old songs they are beautiful melodies. Sometimes I wonder if they had technology that we have today, so it’s an opportunity for us modern music producers to use the technology we have today and use those timeless melodies. I think there’s a lot of scope to show creativity even in recreations. So if you ask me choose one then, because I am a romantic song fan I would do I mean there’s a lot of scope with the song like ‘Pukarta chala hu main’ for example.: Hopefully, Times Music should decide that.: That’s a big suspense.: Right now we are focusing on this particular track and on the first part of it and maybe if you see the end, the love story is the beginning so it will continue from there.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73891661,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-183350/73891661.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/exclusive-shantanu-maheshwari-ash-king-and-bharat-goel-on-their-track-gud-khake/articleshow/73891811.cms

So I mean it was difficult it was challenging but we knew that the director was pretty much sure about the sequence she wanted and I mean we had to do justice to the song.Yeah every actor does intent to work in movies.As I said it’s very challenging the whole thing toh,I can’t save someone else I can just save myself toh I mean it happened in the moment and I saved her.I think Ash has experienced that a lot(laughs): I didn’t make the song, I just sung the song. But the writer and the composer of the song are quiet romantic at heart. So I think Bharat can explain you further.Bharat: So ‘’ is a feeling you know could be triggered by anything when someone is sweet to you or you go through these sweet experiences. It doesn’t have to necessarily be relationships or love it could be for example a small child or someone in the family. Like when your mother makes some delicious food for you it can be ‘’. With this song the attempt was to capture that feeling. It’s not necessarily a romantic love story however in the video when I saw the video I was really impressed because here’s the thing it’s a big challenge to bring out and consistently without making it look forced and I think every aspect of the video, the story, the script, the writing and the beautiful locations and the way they executed it and the sheer passion I think the entire team had in this project, I mean they put Shantanu and Reecha underwater that tells you how passionate they were about the whole project.Shantanu: Also the fact that the when you listen to the song it’s very simple, it connects to you, seems like you feel very romantic. It has that vibe to it and to incorporate that old school vibe that’s what we were looking at in terms of the video and old school it’s like when you’re at weddings. I come from that old school thought that you know, so that kind of cuteness that lost feeling is what I feel is people do not experience that, I think that is the video that it shows like it’s still there.: I think Bharat has been a DJ so he should say this.: So the funny thing is as a DJ I used to do a lot of remixes, it’s funny I started my career with remixes and remakes.He has no issue with remixes.: No, not at all. I think as a producer when I hear timeless melodies that old songs they are beautiful melodies. Sometimes I wonder if they had technology that we have today, so it’s an opportunity for us modern music producers to use the technology we have today and use those timeless melodies. I think there’s a lot of scope to show creativity even in recreations. So if you ask me choose one then, because I am a romantic song fan I would do I mean there’s a lot of scope with the song like ‘Pukarta chala hu main’ for example.: Hopefully, Times Music should decide that.: That’s a big suspense.: Right now we are focusing on this particular track and on the first part of it and maybe if you see the end, the love story is the beginning so it will continue from there.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73891661,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-183350/73891661.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/exclusive-shantanu-maheshwari-ash-king-and-bharat-goel-on-their-track-gud-khake/articleshow/73890124.cms

File photo used for representational purpose

GAYA: Local markets are flooded with plastic carry bags of the prohibited category despite a ban on the same for more than a year now. The incidence of plastic use is rampant in vegetable and other small shops with a heavy buyer footfall, thereby causing avoidable pollution hazard.

Ban on use, manufacture, sale and storage of plastic bags of all sizes was implemented in the urban areas of Bihar from December 2018 and in rural areas from February 2019.

Activist Motibhai said that GMC should ensure that the plastic ban is not blatantly violated. ""Besides, construction materials continue to be transported without the mandatory cover and builders do not sprinkle water and cover the construction site,"" complained the activist.

Gaya municipal commissioner Sawan Kumar told this newspaper that the civic body was committed to fight pollution and the ban on polythene would effectively be implemented. ""We will soon constitute special teams to conduct raids both at the source as well as end use point of plastic bags. Building construction guidelines too would be implemented,"" Sawan said.

Asked about the proposal to ban the entry of motorised vehicles and allow only environment-friendly e-rickshaws on some of the busiest roads including GB Road and KP Road, the municipal commissioner said the idea was not found feasible and as such it has been put on the back burner.

A participant of the rally, Neeraj Ram Prajapati, who was hurt when miscreants hurled stones at them, had died during treatment at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) in Ranchi on January 27.

In urban areas, the prohibitory order was relaxed for 12 hours from 6am, the district administration said. Officials said Section 144 of CrPC will, however, remain in force in the rural areas, thus putting a ban on meetings, processions and congregation of people till further orders.

Farmers turned up at markets to sell their produce while a large number of people were seen walking down the streets of the town area.

SECUNDERABAD: The Rachakonda police slaps cases on close to 100 people daily for consuming alcohol and ganja in the open in Uppal areas, said Y Narsimha Reddy , assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Malkajgiri division.

Several residents from Uppal and its surrounding areas aired their grievances at Times Connect, organised by TOI in Habsiguda on Sunday. Residents complained that there are two wine shops after every 100 meters between Uppal and Medipally stretch, encouraging consumption of alcohol in the open.

Admitting to rampant consumption of alcohol in the open, Narasimha Reddy said: “Every day, we fine 50-100 people in the Uppal limits. Despite having permit rooms adjacent to wine shops, many are seen consuming alcohol in the open. While we do patrolling in these areas, we will enhance the same.”

Few residents also raised concerns over youngsters consuming ganja near Uppal vegetable market at night. Residents claimed that on multiple occasions they dialled 100 to raise a complaint about the same. “While the response rate is faster, the police is unable to nab these youngsters as they escape as soon as they hear the police siren. The police needs to conduct silent operations to nab them,” said a resident.

Reacting on the issue, Reddy said they not only slap fines but also conduct timely counselling for people who are caught consuming ganja. He further added that a few days back, police had nabbed some people with one kg of ganja around the market area following a tip-off from the residents.

Meanwhile, residents sought establishment of a police station only for Habsiguda colonies. “Currently, Habsiguda and its nearby colonies fall under the jurisdiction of Osmania University police station, which is relatively far. We want the government to establish a police station in Ramanthapur , which is closer for perusal,” said Sudhakar Reddy , a resident.

Malkajgiri ACP said that a proposal to setup a police station in Ramanthapur has been lying pending with the government for the past five years. “We will be pursuing the matter with the government for the same,” assured Reddy.

With her was her four-year-old son Luca, who won everyone’s hearts as he walked down the ramp with his mom. The handloom fashion event also marked the little boy’s first public appearance. Isha, who is also busy touring around with her new dance productionalong with her brother Tao Issaro, tells us more about her son, her dreams as a dancer and actor, life in Kerala and more.I feel lucky to have a son like Luca, who loves his mom so much. And I love being a mom. He is my partner in crime and we have a lot of fun together. He loves to perform rope dance and presents it in his own way like a long solo (laughs). He also wants us to watch him when he performs. I have never tried to impose any steps on him, but he learns watching us. When I wondered how he could dance so well at such a young age, my mom said that I used to dance on tables from the age of two, whenever I heard music or when we were in restaurants.At his first public appearance, Luca was a bit shy and nervous, probably as it was his first time seeing so many lights and cameras.Photo Courtesy: Satheeshan KaricheriIsha with her son, LucaI am a fearlessly independent woman. I am financially stable, I raise my child on my own, even doing chores like cooking and cleaning. Whether you are a single parent or not, raising a child is a beautiful experience which we learn a lot from. Children are innocent and have a beautiful perspective on this world. As parents, we can care for them, but I believe we shouldn’t think we know more than them. In my experience, all parents can learn a lot from their kids, alongside taking care of them.I am not saying no to films. I say yes when the right projects come along. The break happened as scripts that interest me haven’t been offered. Even recently, I rejected a script as it didn’t portray women in a way in which I was comfortable. I believe in equality and I’m definitely a feminist. My ideologies have also changed with age.Moreover, I have never been a career-oriented actress, though I love acting and have learnt a lot from the industry, working with talented artistes. My favourite genre is comedy and I love stand-up comedy routines. I will definitely try comedy roles if I get a chance.I believe womanhood means finding happiness within oneself. The most desirable thing for me is a life in peace and serenity. We can spread happiness when we are happy with ourselves. As women, we should feel content and feel our life worth living.The performance shows how a sari is weaved out of handloom. It is choreographed and conceptualised by my mother Daksha Sheth. Its music and direction are by my father Dev Issaro. My brother Tao Issaro performs along with me with the other artistes at the show. We have been touring with it across the world for some time now.The production highlights the individuality of sari and the art of draping it. It might sound like a simple subject, but through the dance, we showcase its journey from being a cotton pod to a handloom fabric, and how it is draped in various styles. Its music is also live.We love handloom and respect the efforts of weavers. That’s why I made an appearance at the fashion show in Thiruvananthapuram, along with my son. The act conveys a similar meaning.Thiruvananthapuram is home for me. I moved here at the age of 12. My parents love Kerala and they are very much part of the place and culture now. My mom is also active in a project that tries to save Vellayani Lake.When I travel abroad, I miss my Kerala breakfast — idli and dosa. I also love appam and fish curry.For me, dance is many things in life. I started it at the age of two and now I am 35 years old. It is also a therapy for me. When I am stressed, I go to the studio and perform for one and a half hours. I come out with a smile and a relaxed mind. Dance, for me, is also an offering to the universe I believe in.I don’t do shows after shows. In 2020, I am planning two projects, which will be ready by the year end.

Jayant Sinha

RANCHI: BJP MP from Hazaribag and former Union minister of state, Jayant Sinha , on Sunday said the Centre is expected to spend anywhere between Rs 500 crore and Rs 1,000 crore for setting up of a world-class tribal museum in Ranchi.

In her budget speech on Saturday, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced support for a tribal museum in the Jharkhand capital.

Sinha said, ""You must have seen the Patna museum which is built at a cost of Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,000 crore. The Centre has plans to investment that much amount to install a state-of-the-art facility to showcase the state tribal's rich history, culture and art. Once ready, it will be one of the global tourist magnets.""

Speaking to reporters at the BJP office en route to Hazaribag, Sinha said the Union Budget 2020 has many other positives for Jharkhand. Citing examples, he said the Centre has increased the tribal budget to about Rs 54,000 crore, including Rs 1,200 crore special grant to the Union ministry of tribal affairs. ""Jharkhand being one of the tribal-dominated states will get benefits and the prospects of Adivasi welfare here is very good,"" he said.

On the Centre's 'Udaan' scheme, a regional air connectivity scheme, Sinha said with the announcement of 100 more airports under this mission, Jharkhand too stands to benefit from the project. Sinha, who served as MoS (civil aviation) when this scheme was launched, said, ""Airports in Jamshedpur, Bokaro and Deoghar are already announced. Work on another in Dhanbad is expected to start soon while revival of another airstrip is awaited. Daltonganj and Hazaribag, too, will now be covered with this scheme and will put the state's remotest district on the aviation map.""

He also hailed Sitharaman's announcement to link every district with a medical college. ""A state like Jharkhand stands to get benefits the most under this scheme,"" he said and added, ""The Centre's fiscal assistance to Jharkhand in the recent years has increased to Rs 30,000 crore. Moreover, funds will continue to flow to the state's coffers from various central, state-sponsored schemes and other sources to help it grow further.""

SECUNDERABAD: Voices to reopen U-turn under the Habsiguda-Tarnaka flyover turned louder as residents sought smoother flow of traffic from Uppal towards Secunderabad . Residents raised serious concerns over traffic issues that plague areas such as Tarnaka, Habsiguda , Uppal main road among others.

The Hyderabad traffic police had closed the Tarnaka crossroads in November, 2015, in view of Metro rail works. Following this, all the commuters travelling from Moula Ali towards Osmania University have to travel till the end of the flyover to take a U-turn.

“At a time when the government is encouraging us to save fuel, we are forced to drive further 1.5 km to take a U-turn. It’s time the traffic police reopens the U-turn to reduce inconvenience among commuters,” said CS Chandrasekhar, a resident of Karthikeya Nagar.

Commuters rue that the traffic conditions on the Tarnaka-Uppal stretch have worsened owing to plying of heavy vehicles during peak hours. Many claimed that auto-tippers and trucks carrying heavy goods are seen plying during school hours causing traffic snarls on the Uppal main road.

“There is heavy traffic near Habsiguda circle towards Nacharam as there are no dividers. Vehicles get into a bottleneck creating nuisance,” said Krishna Rao, a resident of street number 8 in Habsiguda. Few residents also urged the traffic police to install a traffic signal at Habsiguda street number 8 near NGRI for pedestrians to cross the road.

On multiple complaints and requests made by the residents, Y Narsimha Reddy, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Malkajgiri division, said that the same shall be forwarded to the traffic division. “Installation of traffic signals is a decision taken up by the traffic police in association with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation . We will forward al the grievances raised by the residents to the concerned traffic officials for their perusal,” said Reddy.

VARANASI : An Afghan national was arrested from passport office in Varanasi’s Mahmoorganj while he was trying to procure an Indian passport on the basis of fake Aadhaar and voter identity cards.

The man who provided him fake documents was also arrested from Azamgarh.

SP, city, Dinesh Kumar Singh said the accused – Abid Abdullah (25) from Afghanistan and Sahbe Alam of Chamradih village in Azamgarh – have been booked under sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471 of IPC and section 14 the Foreigners Act.

Singh said Abid was arrested on January 31 after passport office employees found his behaviour suspicious and alerted cops.

Abid said he wanted to go to Kuwati but as Afghan nationals are not allowed there, he decided to go there on an Indian passport.

He befriended Alam on Facebook and reached India on January

11.

After staying in Delhi for a few days, Abid visited Azamgarh to meet Alam.

Starring Samantha Akkineni and Sharwanand , this Telugu remake of the Kollywood blockbuster 96 is helmed by the original director Prem Kumar and bankrolled by prominent producer Dil Raju.The pre-release event of Jaanu took place on January 1 in Hyderabad and it was a grand affair with fans thronging to the venue. Speaking amid the electrifying atmosphere, Samantha stated that she initially rejected the film when producer Dil Raju approached her to play the part.“When Dil Raju approached me first, I outrightly rejected the film and said that I can't do it. But, thank you Raju sir for asking me the second time. I could feel that we were creating magic every day on the sets and recreating a classic film in Telugu. I feel that I should talk less before the release. But, I am sure I'll speak more about the film after February 7.”While Sharwanand termed Samantha as a dangerous actress who can easily steal the scene with her impeccable acting abilities, Sam said “Thank you Sharwa for being my Ram. If there's any credit to my acting, it should go to Sharwa. It is because of him. We made a strong team.”From the promos, it’s quite evident that music director Govind Vasantha has stayed true to the genre by composing mesmerising tunes for Jaanu. While the cinematography is brilliantly handled by Mahendran Jayaraj N, the editing has been done by Praveen KL. The film is set for a release on February 7.Helmed on a shoe-string budget, the original version of 96 opened to fabulous response from all quarters and enjoyed a glorious run at the ticket counters.

406,['3/02/2020'],‘Why RTA charging postal fee for docus handed over in office’,"This story is from February 3, 2020

SECUNDERABAD: The collection of postal fee by the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) for documents that are handed over to the applicants directly at the RTA office stood out as one of the major grievances of Uppal residents.

Residents alleged that RTA officials are collecting ?35 as postal fee for issuing key documents such as no objection certificate, driving license clearance certificate and international driving permit.

“RTA is collecting ?35 as postal charges, but the same documents are being delivered by evening. Why should the RTA collect postal charges if the documents are being collected by 4pm in the evening on the same day? Where is this money going? We need to know whether all this money that we pay is going to the government, postal department or RTA? There should be a CBI enquiry in this matter,” said M Dayanand, a resident of Tarnaka.

They urged the officials to either send the documents home or stop collecting the postal charges. “The fee for most of these documents include application fee, service charge, smart card fee and postal charges. Delivering key documents through speed post was made mandatory by the government in 2008 to ensure that no fake addresses are used and this needs to be implemented strictly,” said U Yadagiri, a resident and general secretary, Shakthi Auto and Goods Drivers’ Union.

Accepting that the postal charges are being collected for documents that are being given to the applicants by hand on the same day, RTA administrative officer B Prasad Rao , said, “It is true that for some services the postal charges are being collected. Since this is a state-wide problem, I will take this issue to the notice of our head office and we will correct the policy.”

MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray , whose party severed ties with the BJP after the state elections, on Monday said that if somebody breaks a promise, ""pain and anger is obvious"".

""No, I did not get any shock,"" Thackeray said in an interview with Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana while talking about forming an alliance with NCP and Congress , and becoming the Maharashtra chief minister.

""I am a son of Shiv Sena Pramukh ( Balasaheb Thackeray ), several people tried to give a shock to me but they didn't succeed. This is a field where you have to accept in the beginning that there will be a bit pushing and pulling,"" Thackeray said.

He added that accepting the chief minister's post was not a shock for him and neither was it his ""dream at any point of time""

""But I can say one thing for sure that I had decided to go to any level to fulfil the promise which I made to Balasaheb Thackeray. I want to further clear it that me becoming chief minister is not the fulfilling of the promise made to Shiv Sena Pramukh but it's just a step towards that. I will fulfil every promise which I made to my father,"" Uddhav Thackeray said.

""There are several types of shock. Did people like it or not, it is the important part. I have spoken on this issue (alliance with NCP and Congress) several times and even people have understood this. Making promises and keeping them are two different things. If someone breaks a promise, pain and anger is obvious,"" he added.

The chief minister said that he does not know if BJP ""has come out their shock till now or not.""

""But I have to say if they had kept their promise what would have happened, what a big deal had I asked for? Did I ask for stars and moon? I only asked for what was decided before Lok Sabha polls, when we decided seat distribution,"" he said.

He further said, ""Maharashtra and the country are watching (who betrayed/shocked whom), I don't need to say much on this.""

Soon after the assembly election results, Shiv Sena demanded rotation of the chief minister's post and equal power-sharing in the state government, which was rejected by then ally BJP. The weeks of political stalemate led to the imposition of President's rule on November 13.

Firm on its demands, Sena, the second-largest party in the state, did not hesitate to cobble up with the ideological opponents -- NCP and Congress -- and was given the chief minister's post.

Prince Harry and Megan Markle

MONTREAL: A clear majority of Canadians feel their country does not have to pay for security for Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle, who have settled in British Columbia.

Seventy-seven per cent of people surveyed by Nanos Research, for CTV, believe the Candian taxpayer does not have to pay for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex because they are not in Canada as representatives of the Queen.

Canada is a parliamentary monarchy and Queen Elizabeth II is the reigning head of state.

Only 19 per cent of Canadians would not object to their country assuming a share of the security costs.

There has been no official announcement about the question of security for Prince Harry and Meghan, or who will cover the bill, now that they have officially left the royal family.

Canadian authorities have only indicated that discussions were taking place.

More than two-thirds of Canadians feel the privacy of the couple and their infant son will be better respected in Canada than it was in Britain.

But Harry and Meghan -- who live in Victoria, on Vancouver Island -- are taking no chances: last month they issued a legal warning to media over photographs of the duchess out walking her dogs with Archie, their son.

Their lawyers claimed the images were taken without Meghan's consent, the BBC reported, and the couple were prepared to take legal action.

Perhaps more worrying for the couple in the long run is that only 32 per cent of those surveyed were strongly in favour of maintaining links with the royal family and their country's status as a constitutional monarchy. Twenty-eight per cent said they were only somewhat supported that option.

And 35 percent would be more or less strongly in favour of abolishing links with the British monarchy.

The survey was conducted by telephone and online, with a sample of 1,003 Canadians and a margin of error of 3.1 per cent.

413,['3/02/2020'],Education must for artistes: Ustad Anwar Khan,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Ustad Anwar Khan Manganiar was conferred the Padma Shri this year.

JAIPUR: Ustad Anwar Khan Manganiar , 60, is attending hundreds of phone calls since his name was announced for Padma Shri . People who congratulated him included Gaj Singh of erstwhile royal family of Jodhpur to Grammy award winners. Khan wishes that the next generation of the folk musicians of western Rajasthan should also go for proper education, to excel in life.

Khan was humbled while receiving congratulatory messages and phone calls. "" Sab phone kar riya hain, sangeet ra premi hain saa (Everyone is calling me up. They are music lovers),"" he said while talking to TOI over phone from Barmer. He was also felicitated at the Republic Day function in Jaisalmer and has been getting invitation for other functions in Barmer too.

Khan, a Manganiyar artiste, was born at Baiya village of Jaisalmer and now lives at Indira colony in Barmer. He has also been felicitated by the President of India with the Sangeet Natak Akademy Award in 2017. ""I can't remember since when I started singing. Since it is my only bread and butter, so far there has not been a single day when I skipped singing,"" he added.

Attributing the recognition gained by the folk music of western Rajasthan to several Langas and Manganiyars, Khan has given his voice to a few Hindi movies including 'Rang Rasiya', where he was a playback singer with Kailash Kher. ""The award is an honour for the folk music of western Rajasthan. This is also a recognition to the Langas and Manganiyars, who are selflessly singing and keeping the folk music alive,"" he said.

Having travelled more than 50 countries for his musical performances, Khan further stated that such a recognition certainly benefits folk music and the arts. ""I have got many awards from other countries like Russia and Scotland. But an award for a folk artiste in his own country will inspire the next generation of Langas and Manganiyars to work harder and to keep practising their music and art,"" he added.

During the interaction, he further stressed on his community to ensure that the next generation of musicians should get proper education. ""I am not very educated, as except for my musical craft, I have no other knowledge. So, if the next generation of our musicians will study well, they can do well for themselves and can earn fame and glory,"" he added.

Khan has only one regret in his life. "" Angrezi awani chahijey, kaam avey hai (One should know English, it helps),"" he added.

Representative image

SECUNDERABAD: With residents of Uppal complaining that fogging machines just zip past their area, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) officials took note of the exact locations and added them to their pin-point programme.

As a part of the programme, anti-larval operations are carried out in a locality every eight days. The newly-appointed zonal commissioner also promised bio-remediation and antilarval operations with the help of drones. The drones would be pressed into service especially around lakes and places where human cannot reach physically.

Replying to a question by a resident, GHMC zonal commissioner, LB Nagar, and additional commissioner, information technology wing, Sikta Patnaik said, “Fogging for a longer duration or staff equipped with fogging machines plying too slow can result in accidents. Fogging has to be done scientifically.”

She also explained the measures being taken by the entomology wing through drone and pin-point programme. GHMC entomology department officials emphasised that fumigation, in terms of fogging, was not the solution to reduce vector-borne diseases. Fogging would be done only on streets away from houses following the World Health Organization (WHO) rules, they added.

As per norms, if an employee carries a portable fogging machine (used in bylanes) on a bike, the speed limit should be between five km and 10 km. The vehicle-mounted machines ply on main roads and they ply fast compared to portable machines. “Number of vehicle-mounted fogging machines has been scaled up across Greater Hyderabad,” the IAS officer said.

Coordination with sanitation, engineering and entomology department by removing garbage points, identification of hot spots by taking epidemiological data between 2017 and 2020 were the other activities GHMC was taking up in LB Nagar as well as in rest of the city, according to entomology wing officers. “GHMC is also using eportal information to track dengue cases and take measures accordingly,” they added.

Representational Image

KOCHI: In a major narcotic bust in Kochi City police limits, around 12.5kg of ganja was seized from two youths in joint operation led by Palarivattom police and District Anti-Narcotic Special Action Force (Dansaf) on Sunday.

The accused were identified as Sreekuttan (26) of Illikkal House at Palarivattom and Ajith Anil (21) of Ambalaparambil House at Thiruvalla. According to police, the ganja seized from them was brought from Andhra Pradesh by train and was meant for sale to retail drug dealers in the city.

Police said that they bought the ganja in bulk quantity at Rs 600 per kilogram from ganja cultivators in Andhra Pradesh and sold at a price multiple times higher than the buying price. Sreekuttan left Kerala a few years ago after an estranged relationship with his family and went to Goa as staff in a hotel. It was during that time he started working for drug mafia.

“Though he reached Kerala last year and started working as a manager in a private firm, he continued his drug dealings. Anil was his colleague and they together carried out the illegal trade. Sreekuttan is an accused in a ganja case registered at South police station. Anil is an accused in a ganja case in Pathanamthitta. Both were under police surveillance for more than two months. They have been trapped after collecting information about their recent deals and travels,” police said.

A case has been registered under NDPS Act against the two accused, who will be presented before the magistrate on Monday. The police operation was led by narcotic cell assistant commissioner Biji George.

JAIPUR: Karauli police are yet to arrest the accused who shot dead a teenager in accidental firing on Saturday. The police teams have been searching the area for the accused but tracing him in the forest area is proving to be a challenge.

Teams are conducting overnight searches for the accused who is suspected to be hiding there.

Teja Ram (16) was killed when Ramveer Gujjar fired in the air in an inebriated state. The incident is of Langra in Karauli district . According to police, the accused has a criminal record and would randomly fire in air but this time the bullet hit the teenager, who was standing on the roadside after leaving his animals in the forest area for grazing.

Karauli SP, Anil Kumar who is spearheading the search said, ""Our teams have been deployed to look for the accused and we will not stop the search till we find him. The biggest problem is that there is a large forest area, to search inside that is time consuming. Teams have been deployed at various locations to look for the accused.""

Gujjar has been involved in cases of dacoity and in the past also has fired in air after getting drunk. ""We are on the job and talking to locals as well to find the accused's location. There were witnesses to the incident and their statements will also be recorded. Gujjar is also a local and there are chances that he might get in touch with some of his accomplices,"" added the official.

Sources claimed that there are very less chances that Gujjar might have gone out of Langra as there was heavy police presence in the area, making it difficult to get out without being noticed.

423,['3/02/2020'],Supreme Court begins hearing in Sabarimala temple matter,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Supreme Court of India

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court's nine-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde, on Monday began hearing the Sabarimala temple matter and other related cases, involving entry of women into the temple.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the apex court that the issues can be framed in the chambers itself. He stated that there is no need to frame the questions and other issues if relevant, in an open court.

After hearing Mehta's submissions, CJI Bobde observed that there are questions that arose in Sabarimala, and also there are questions that are there in other cases such as Muslim women's demand to enter mosques, and the FGM in Dawoodi Bohras and whether Parsi women married to non-Parsis lose religion.

Earlier, CJI Bobde had said that the court will examine the matter and hear the scope of judicial review on the point of religious faith and women's rights.

He had fixed a 10-day period for concluding the hearing on the petition seeking women's entry into Sabarimala temple, mosques, and Parsi Agiyari.

The apex court had on January 13 said that it will only hear the questions referred to in the review order passed by it in November last year in the Sabarimala temple case, which allowed women and girls of all age groups to visit the shrine in Kerala.

The top court had in November last year, observed that the entry of women into places of worship is not just limited to the Sabarimala temple but also includes issues like allowing Muslim and Parsi women to enter religious practice.

The court is hearing a clutch of petitions seeking reconsideration of its September 2018 judgment that lifted the bar on menstruating women from worshipping in the Sabarimala temple.

The apex court in a landmark 4:1 ruling had set aside decades-old restrictions on the entry of women of menstruating age inside the temple.

The verdict had sparked a series of protests across Kerala, which eventually led to the filing of several petitions seeking review of the top court's order challenging the authority of the court to intervene in a belief of the people.

SECUNDERABAD: The long pending connectivity issue of Hyderabad Metro Rail from Uppal to LB Nagar phase II project, parking and rainwater harvesting were some of the issues raised by the residents on Sunday.

Locals were concerned over the delay in commencement of second phase of works, which would improve connectivity to many areas. “We want to know when the officials are planning to connect Uppal to LB Nagar Metro extension as residents are still being forced to spend more money as they have to depend on cabs and autos for transport? We also want to know if there is any plan to extend the services from BHEL to Mehdipatnam?” asked P Shashi Kumar, a resident of Uppal.

They also raised concerns about commuting problems from surrounding areas of ECIL such as Kushaiguda and Nagaram. “Commuting from ECIL to surrounding areas has become really difficult for a many people. A Metro extension from ECIL to Tarnaka will benefit people staying on this side of the city,” added Shashi Kumar.

Residents suggested the officials to provide better parking facilities at Metro stations and also re-direct the rainwater pipelines into water harvesting pits in some places.

The HMRL superintendent engineer Sayappa Reddy said, “The Metro extensions from Uppal to LB Nagar and BHEL to Mehdipatnam are under phase II and they will be taken up as soon the works for that phase commence. We will also look into the issue of rainwater harvesting pits. The parking has been provided near all those stations where there is enough space.”

Thinkirat Kohli and you will think of a fierce competitor who gives his 100 percent on the field every single time, both as a batsman and as India and Royal Challengers Bangalore captain.The number one player in the ICC Test and ODI rankings for batsmen is a force to reckon with for every opposition team in the world. Under Virat's captaincy Team India reclaimed the number 1 Test rank in the world. He recently became the first Indian to score 40 centuries as captain. He is also the most successful Indian Test captain ever with 33 Test wins under his belt. And the list goes on and on.In other words, Virat the batsman and the India captain has conquered the world.But, one tournament where Virat the captain still remains empty handed in terms of silverware is the IPL. In the 12 seasons of the Indian Premier League so far, Virat has played for only one team, the Royal Challengers Bangalore. And RCB have never won the IPL title.In fact, one of the big questions before every IPL season is will RCB break their title jinx and will Virat Kohli , who was appointed as the official captain of RCB ahead of the 2012 season finally win the IPL title?In the run up to IPL 2020 , it's not surprising that the fans have begun asking the same question. In fact one fan during the first India vs New Zealand T20 international in Auckland on Friday was seen holding a banner which read ""13 kya hoga Kohli-ya?"". A witty take on the famous dialogue from the blockbuster film Sholay used to ask the question - will season 13 be Virat's season?Virat the batsman has set the stage on fire in the IPL many times. In fact, the 973 runs he scored, with 4 centuries and 7 fifties in the 2016 season, when RCB finished as the runner-up, is a record that will be very hard to break. In fact, Virat is the leading run getter in IPL history with 5412 runs.But Virat the RCB captain is still waiting to break the team's title jinx.From the inaugural season of the IPL in 2008, the complexion of the Royal Challengers Bangalore team has changed multiple times. Many different batting and bowling combinations have been tried, coaches have changed, but the quest for the holy grail of franchise based domestic T20 cricket continues for Virat and his team. The sheer unpredictability of the team is perhaps best showcased in the fact that RCB hold the records for both the highest (263/5 in 2013) and lowest (49 all out in 2017) team totals in IPL history.So, will IPL season 13 prove to be the lucky one for Virat and his team?For most Indian fans there is an emotional connect also of sorts with RCB, regardless of which team they might support in the IPL. And that connect is because of Virat's incredible popularity across the country. So, most fans do feel bad when RCB struggle.There have been 8 seasons with Virat at the helm of affairs at RCB (from 2012 onwards). In that time the franchise has managed to finish in the top 3 only twice, finishing last on the points table in 2017 and 2019.T20 will be the flavour of the year in 2020 and 2021, with two back to back T20 World Cups lined up. In that context, the IPL will be a very important platform for cricketers from across the world to sharpen their T20 skills.If the team backs their captain and every player manages to step up to the plate, IPL season 13 could well see RCB under Virat Kohli's captaincy finally break their title jinx.",sports,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73590491,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-217026,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2020-will-this-be-the-season-virat-kohli-breaks-his-title-jinx/articleshow/73586659.cms

KOTA: After police investigation gave a clean chit to the school administration on Friday - in a case where a minor boy was allegedly thrashed and thrown into a water tank by one of his class teachers - a few video clips went viral on Sunday, showing a member of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Bundi counselling the 7-year-old boy in an intimidating manner, sparking a controversy.

The viral videos have raised questions on the manner of the minor's counselling by the CWC member. The minor's father Chandradeep Singh alias Sonu Singh, a resident of Bibanwa Road of Bundi city on Sunday evening submitted a report against the CWC member Shobha Kasat and investigating officer Kurshed Khan , accusing them of severely torturing his son in the name of counselling and demanded to lodge a case against them under appropriate sections of IPC.

The parents of the minor boy, who studies in a private school in Bundi, on Thurssday last week had alleged that one of his class teachers had beaten him up with a stick and had thrown him into a water tank as punishment for not having covered his copies.

Besides, an audio clip has also surfaced where the private school proprietor is heard tempting the kid's father to sort out the matter through negotiation, while asking him not to bring police into the matter. However, police after investigation into the matter, on Friday gave a clean chit to the school administration.

The CWC member Shobha Kasat on Saturday visited the school and carried out counselling with the minor to verify the allegation of beating and throwing him into the water tank as punishment. In the video clips, Kasat is seen 'counselling' the minor boy, who is visibly stressed and alarmed, in the presence of investigating police official and the school staff members, but did not allow his father to be present on the spot and kept him out of the school gate. On being asked, the stressed kid nods to having been beaten and thrown into the water tank, but Kasat does not accept his response and goes on repeating her queries in a high-pitched tone.

Moreover, ignoring the kid's nodding, the CWC member continues asking him, ""Doesn't Mahima madam (the accused teacher) love you and does she always beat you?"" Later, Kasat, along with investigating cop and staff members, takes the minor boy in her lap to the said water tank, in which the boy was allegedly thrown, and asks him, ""Tell me truly, did Mahima madam throw you into the tank yesterday and if she did, I will also throw you into the this tank, tell me the truth."" Meanwhile, the investigating cop (Kurshed Khan) is holding a heavy and long beam to measure the depth of the tank and the minor further gets terrorized at the site of the beam. The CWC member then bends the minor into the water tank repeating the same, ""I would also throw you into the tank.""

When contacted, CWC member, Kasat also gave a clean chit to the school staff and the teacher saying the kid was never beaten and thrown into the water tank in the school and added, ""I have submitted report to the investigating police official."" (She being a member of judicial body is supposed to submit the report to the collector or to senior officials of the CWC). When questioned about not allowing the father of the minor boy in the counselling session, she said, ""The CWC guideline does not allow the presence of parents.""

""We have received the complaint against the CWC member Shobha Kasat and ASI Kurshed Khan and will submit the same to SHO for investigation,"" said duty officer at Bundi Sadar police station. Meanwhile, CWC chairman Kota Kaniz Fatima said minors in any kind of counselling, cannot be spoken to in a high-pitched tone, as he/she needs soft and polite treatment in a healthy environment and the presence of minor's parents is also necessary, so that he/she may not feel terrorized.

Can you get bird flu from eating eggs?,"Even as the Chinese authorities are working round the clock to contain the deadly coronavirus--which has since spread to 24 other countries including India--the outbreak of the fatal bird flu has also been reported in the country. This disease is also known as the H5N1 which is a type of influenza virus and is known to cause extremely infectious respiratory diseases in birds. This infection causes severe disease in humans and has a high mortality rate (60 percent, according to the WHO).A highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 bird flu has been detected at a farm in Shaoyang city of the southern province of Hunan in China.According to a report, more than 4,500 chickens died on the farm where the outbreak was first reported. Hence, the Chinese government has culled 17,828 chickens as a precautionary measure. The World Health Organization has stated that even though H5N1 can be transmitted to humans, it does not infect them easily.The Bird flu disease, as the name suggests is a strain of virus which affects birds including chicken, ducks and other poultry and wild birds.This disease is also known as the H5N1 virus and causes severe respiratory infection in birds. It is known to spread in humans through contact with infected bird feces and their other bodily secretions.

Do not consume runny eggs3. Cook poultry thoroughly at or above 70 degree Celsius to kill the H5N1 virus4.

440,['3/02/2020'],Samatha gangrape case: Thorough probe led to swift justice,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Meticulous collection of evidence and thorough investigation led to the conviction of three culprits in the Samatha case, where a woman from Yellapatar village in Adilabad was gangraped and killed on November 24, 2019. The three were sentenced to death by a fasttrack court on January 30 after trial in a little over two months, thereby silencing people demanding encounter killing of the accused or entrusting the case to CBI.

This case reaffirms that justice can be provided in courts of law if police are allowed to make use of technology and investigate cases without influence.

As the trial was conducted without loss of time, there was little scope for the accused or their counsel to delay the hearings. Farm labourers who had heard the screams of the victim and saw the accused leave the spot were the main witnesses and, based on their detailed statements, the court was able to prove that the three accused had indeed committed the offence.

There were other witnesses too in the village who saw the accused following the victim and also a kirana shop owner who saw the accused with blood-stained clothes. This coupled with scientific evidence linking the blood and semen samples of both the accused and the deceased clinched the case in favour of the prosecution.

Interestingly, the main accused had himself admitted before the court that he went to Yellapatar on the day of the crime, though he claimed that it was only to collect ration. Though the other two accused claimed that they were outside the village on that day, they could not bring to the fore any evidence in support of their claims. On the other hand, the prosecution had proved their presence at the crime spot.

Adilabad principal sessions judge MG Priyadarshini, who was appointed as the special judge for the designated fast-track court, described the case as a rarest of rare cases because the accused showed no mercy towards the suffering of a fellow human being and said that they behaved in a barbaric manner. Dismissing the mercy pleas of the three criminals at the end, the judge proved a point that the anguish of the society against such crimes will be shared by the judiciary as well if the system acts in a prompt and swift manner.

BENGALURU: Former Union minister and BJP MP Anantkumar Hegde is in the news again for the wrong reasons, this time for attacking Mahatma Gandhi and calling the freedom struggle led by him a ""drama"".

He also questioned as to how ""such people"" come to be called 'Mahatma' in India.

While addressing a public event in Bengaluru on Saturday, the Lok Sabha MP from Uttara Kannada said the entire freedom movement was ""staged with the consent and support of the British"".

""None of these so-called leaders were beaten up by the cops even once. Their independence movement was one big drama. It was staged by these leaders with the approval of the British. It was not a genuine fight. It was an adjustment freedom struggle,"" he said.

The senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader also termed Mahatma Gandhi's hunger strikes and satyagraha a ""drama"".

""People supporting Congress keep saying that India got independence because of the fast unto death and satyagraha. This is not true. The British did not leave the country because of satyagraha,"" he said.

"" Britishers gave independence out of frustration. My blood boils when I read history. Such people become Mahatma in our country,"" Hegde said in his concluding statement.

442,['3/02/2020'],Karnataka: Too many agencies muddle the process,"This story is from February 3, 2020

CM BS Yediyurappa with Lakshmi Mittal recently

The Karnataka government is probably the only state to have so many nodal agencies to deal with investment proposals. There is the KIADB , Karnataka Udyoga Mitra , State High Level Clearance Committee ( SHLCC ), State Level Single Window Clearance Committee (SLSWCC) and District Level Single Window Clearance Committee.

While the government claims these have been created to speed up the process of setting up industries, they’re only delaying it. “A four-to-five year delay in acquiring land has become the norm,’’ say industry sources.

“These entities are only adding layers of obstacles to investors and is not really helping industries,” said a senior IAS officer.

While DLSWCCs are headed by deputy commissioners are empowered to clear investment proposals up to Rs 15 crore, SLSWCC, headed by the industries minister, clears proposals more than Rs 15 crore and up to Rs 500 crore. Proposals worth more than Rs 500 crore have to be cleared by SHLCC chaired by the CM. These entities have to meet regularly and clear proposals. But often, these meetings don’t happen as scheduled. “The delay starts from here,” said Vasant Ladava, industrialist and member of Karnataka Industries and Commerce, Bengaluru.

The single-window agencies involving representatives of departments like industries, revenue, pollution control board and forest are supposed to collectively give necessary clearances required for industries. “But, of late, they have become only project approvers without other responsibilities, leaving investors in the lurch,” said Ladava.

BENGALURU: Cardiac care has taken a hit across India with the ranks of cardiologists having shrunk. In all, 1,706 clinical cardiologists lost their specialist tag following Medical Council of India's recent decision not to grant approval for post-graduate diploma in clinical cardiology course they had completed between 2006-13 from Indira Gandhi National Open University.Close to 350 doctors from Karnataka graduated with PGDCC and 120 of them are working in the state.""The objective of this course was to train physicians working in semi-urban areas in community cardiology to diagnose and prevent cardiac ailme nts. It was not meant to compete with medical colleges. The irony is that MCI is objecting to a course started by the Union health ministry. There is certainly some wisdom lacking here,"" noted cardiologist Dr Devi Shetty said.""Most cardiologists live in cities and the worst affected will be patients in non-urban set-ups. In fact, the situation now is the same as that of 2006 when the course started,"" said Dr Shetty, who was among those who had designed the PGDCC curriculum.Dr Ravi Shankar HP, who works in Chamarajanagar government hospital and is a PGDCC holder, said, ""I am proud to have saved many lives by diagnosing heart ailments among patients coming to government hospitals. I have been trained in clinical cardiology for two years from Narayana Hrudayalaya.""Incidentally, the two-year PGDCC course was not a distance-education programme, but a post-graduation course conducted after an all-India entrance exam in 77 hospitals with separate cardiology departments. In Karnataka, seven hospitals in Bengaluru and one each in Mysuru and Mangaluru offered this course.MCI's major objection was that the training programme wasn't evaluated within one year of the course in accordance with the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 rules. Ignou hadn't obtained MCI's nod before starting the course.The course was stopped in 2013 and the last batch graduated in 2015. No fresh admissions were made in 2014 and 2015. Disappointed doctors approached the Delhi high court, which in September 2019 asked the Union health ministry to take a decision in the matter. The court also directed MCI to consider Ignou's application for grant of recognition to PGDCC.However, MCI's board of governors concluded that those doctors cannot be allowed to work as cardiologists.Top cardiologists, including Dr Shetty, have written to the Union health minister to recognise PGDCC. The Indian Association of Clinical Cardiologists has also raised the matter with the Centre.IACC chairman Dr Rajesh Rajan said, ""Due to non-recognition of the course, we are facing disrespect in society, to the extent of being labelled as 'quacks'. In some states like Kerala, the government has appointed PGDCC doctors in taluk and district hospitals as clinical cardiologists.""",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73894102,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-723911,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/1700-cardiologists-lose-specialist-tag-after-mci-order/articleshow/73893184.cms

453,['3/02/2020'],Umar Akmal faces sanctions for misbehaving during fitness test: Report,"This story is from February 3, 2020

(Getty Images)

KARACHI: Pakistan's out-of-favour wicketkeeper Umar Akmal could face disciplinary action after he reportedly asked a trainer ""where is the fat"" while exposing himself completely during a fitness test.

The matter has been reported to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and according to an 'ESPNcricinfo' report, they are fully aware of the incident that took place at the National Cricket Academy and are looking at potential punishments for bringing the game into disrepute.

The junior Akmal, who is reported to have exposed himself in frustration after failing to pass one of the fitness tests, is now faced with the prospect of being banned from the country's next domestic tournament.

He is said to have asked a staff ""bataye charbee kaha hain (tell me where is the fat)"".

Fitness has been an issue with the Akmal brothers for several years now with Umar falling out with the PCB on the same grounds during Mickey Arthur 's time as head coach.

This comes at a time when the PCB, under the stewardship of former captain Misbah-ul-Haq , has pledged its commitment to maintaining high fitness standards not just in international but also in domestic cricket.

As per Misbah's instructions, each provincial side is required to regulate fitness tests on a quarterly basis.

Umar's elder brother Kamran, who himself skipped two fitness tests, before failing in nearly all departments when he finally did take one, said the incident at the NCA was simply a ""misunderstanding"".

Once seen as a bright prospect, Umar scored a century on Test debut against New Zealand in 2009, and remained a regular feature for some years until poor form and fitness led to him being dropped in favour of Sarfaraz Ahmed .

In 16 Tests, Umar made 1003 runs with one century and six fifties. While in 121 ODIs, he has 3194 runs with two centuries -- the best being 102 not out.

In 84 T20 Internationals, Akmal has made 1690 runs with the highest score of 94 and eight half-centuries to his name.

454,['3/02/2020'],HONOR 9X and Kirin 710F - Killer combo for the perfect mid-range smartphone,"What do you look for while buying a smartphone? Impressive camera set-up, bankable battery backup, sufficient internal storage? While we compare and analyse all these features, most of us ignore the most important feature that makes or breaks a phone - its processor. From the quick and quality processing of our pictures to smoother interface and overall trusting performance, the core features of any smartphone are decided by its processor. And one brand that has aced this arena has to be HONOR. Backed by its trusted and impeccable HiSilicon Kirin series, HONOR phones have been known for their smooth user experience.The latest addition in this kitty is the HONOR 9X , backed by the revamped HiSilicon Kirin 710F chipset. The phone, which launched on January 14, 2020 has been pushing people to be #UpForXtra and is packed with Xtraordinary features in every front. But before we delve into everything that users are loving about the HONOR 9X, let’s explore the chipset that makes this extraordinary phone truly exceptional - the Kirin 710F.The Kirin 710F ensures that the chip has more transistors in place, without actually increasing the space occupied by the chipset. Built on the 12nm process node, the Kirin 710F chipset is smaller as compared to its predecessor, the Kirin 659. This compact chipset gives more space for phone-manufacturers to amp up other components like battery backup, number of cameras, among others.The processor of your phone is especially important for serious gamers who are always on the lookout for smooth and lag-free gaming sessions. The Kirin 710F comes with ARM Mali G5 GPU and supports GPU Turbo 3.0 technology that enables a faster and smoother gaming experience. The touch input latency in this software is also reduced by 36%, ensuring that the phone responds instantly at your touch, without lagging.GPU Turbo 3.0 technology supports 4D vibration feedback, which will give you a console-like feel while playing on your phone, on the go. The graphics processor is armoured with a game app that block calls and other notifications and ensures that you have an undistracted gaming session.While the lag-free and distraction-less gaming experience may seem like the dream for many, some may rightly question the possibility of speedy connections while on the go. The Kirin 710F delivers in this front with the dual-4G VoLTE support. This ensures that the network on your second SIM slot does not fall back to 3G or 2G. The chipset also offers an upload speed of up to 150MBPS and download speed of 600 MBPS, so you are always connected and can easily download or update your apps and games.The Kirin 710F chipset is designed to support AI scene recognition, which facilitates the phone to recognise 500 scenes in 22 categories. This feature adds to the phone camera’s ability to distinguish the products in focus and sharpens the picture output. With such a vast range of abilities, the chipset uses Machine Learning to detect the product in focus, sets the tone, and adjusts the shooting mode to deliver professional quality pictures. Further, the Kirin 710F chipset ensures that the face-unlock feature in your smartphone is not misused. The AI feature detects if your eyes are open or closed, and based upon it, permits or restricts access to the phone.One of the biggest issues that users often face with smartphones has to be the lag issues that begin early on. Your phone can have the best camera set-up or enough space to download your favourite games, but if the processor messes things up, you are bound to be left with a phone that hangs on camera mode or losing games, just because of the lagging phase.With the Kirin 710F’s octa-core processor, this becomes a thing of the past. Kirin 710F boasts of four Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 1.7 GHz, which ensures smoother switches between apps, better performance during gaming and quicker access to apps. These efficiency cores also keep a check on your data usages while streaming videos or browsing social media.From its octa-core processor that ensures smoother performances to the CPU Turbo 3.0 that acts as a blessing for all gaming enthusiasts, Kirin 710F truly makes sure that your phone is reliable in every front. And now that we know what makes this processor out of the ordinary, its time to talk about the device that it is powering – the HONOR 9X. Its trusting 4000mAh battery combined with Kirin 710F’s power- efficient feature, the exemplary triple camera (48MP + 8MP +2 MP) set up that captures everything in great detail, all makes this phone a perfect choice.Priced at Rs 13,999 for the 4GB RAM variant and Rs 16,999 for the 6GB variant, the HONOR 9X is available online on Flipkart. The phone comes in two colour options - Midnight Black and Sapphire Blue and has been on sale from 19January. So, if you are on the lookout for a phone whose processor is here to deliver on every front, HONOR 9X is the choice for you!",spotlight,https://static.toiimg.com/photo/73519990.cms,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//spotlight/honor-magicwatch-2-everything-a-great-smartwatch-should-have/articleshow/73759006.cms

Representative image

PUNE: Police have identified five gangs of criminals involved in the string of cash thefts from automated teller machines (ATM) across Pimpri Chinchwad in the past few months.

About 16 cases of ATM cash thefts have been registered with the Pimpri Chichwad police. In some cases, the suspects had cut the ATMs with gas cutters. There have been instances of the thieves dragging away the ATMs with sports utility vehicles and ropes. Of all these cases, only one has been detected so far.

Pimpri Chinchwad additional commissioner of police Ramnath Pokale said “We have taken up the cases seriously and formed a special investigation team (SIT) to track down the thieves.”

He said, “The police have done a detailed study of all the thefts and examined the modus operandi of the suspects — like the time they strike and their operation areas. We are taking preventive actions on the basis of the study.”

Pokale told TOI that the probe has so far revealed involvement of five gangs in the thefts. “Three gangs are from some other cities of Maharashtra and two are from outside the state,” he said.

The police have sent their teams to Haryana and Rajasthan to track down the thieves. “The remaining three gangs are from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Kolhapur. Our teams have been sent to those cities as well,” Pokale said.

The police have identified eight points the suspects used either to enter Pimpri Chinhcwad or escape and started carrying out nakabandi operations there. Assistant commissioner of police R R Patil said. “Personnel from the crime branch and police stations are being used for the ‘nakabandi’ operation. Assistant commissioners of police monitor such operations.”

An officer said most of the ATM kiosks did not have guards. “In all the 16 theft cases, the police did not get any alert as the kiosks were not equipped with the siren facility,” he said.

Asaduddin Owaisi

HYDERABAD: Taking potshots at finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s budget speech on Saturday that was over two hours long, AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday said, “The speech by the finance minister was like a long movie where people desperately waited for an interval.”

He was speaking at a meet organised by United Muslim Action Committee (UMAC) for women on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), NPR and NRC at Shivarampally.

Owaisi also mentioned the firing incident that took place in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh. “An Union minister in an election meeting said ‘Desh Ke Gaddaro Ko Goli Maro Saalo Ko’ and within 48 hours a youngster resorted to violence,” the Hyderabad MP said without naming Union minister Anurag Thakur.

He also slammed Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath and said, “We will not forget the UP CM’s badla vow and the reign of revenge that followed, which resulted in numerous Muslims being assaulted and killed by the UP police.”

Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath had sparked a controversy with his speech at a public rally in Delhi recently where he said that anyone trying to open fire at those participating in Kanwar Yatra will be dealt with bullets.

“The CAA is unconstitutional and should be scrapped. Women have always been a huge part of the anti-CAA protest as we feel insecured about our future. We will show our aggressive side to sustain and maintain the anti-CAA movement till the Act is rolled back,” said Ayesha Rubina, AIMIM corporator from Ahmednagar.

PUNE: The Railway Protection Force ( RPF ) has decided to shake up its system of escorting trains in a bid to break pattern and curb crime on long-haul and suburban trains.

Under the new, ""dynamic"" system, the RPF will deploy escort teams at random and also on trains depending on the need. Earlier, the RPF would only focus on certain trains originating from the Pune division.

""At present, there are 32 trains, including six suburbans, in which the RPF personnel provide security. However, more than 100 trains originate from the Pune division. The selected trains and sections had a track record of offences. Now we plan to factor in the crime pattern in the remaining trains and deploy escort teams,"" divisional security commissioner Arun Tripathi told TOI.

""We plan to conduct a weekly analysis to identify trains that require security. RPF personnel can board any train during the week. The escort team would not limit itself to a specific number of trains. After one week, a new set of trains would be selected,"" he said.

The move, Tripathi said, would act as a deterrent to criminals who tend to target trains they know would be devoid of any escort.

“People purchase birds like partridges, francolins and waterhens for consumption and in rare cases they are used for black magic,” Baig said, adding, “The meat of a monitor lizard, especially its tongue and liver, are believed to be aphrodisiacs. However, this is just a myth.”

PUNE: Even though some concerns persist, experts have largely hailed the Centre’s decision to develop 100 airports for the regional connectivity scheme by 2024.

“UDAN, being a futuristic mega project, is expected to experience teething troubles. That 250 routes are operational — with 45 unserved/underserved airports being operationalized — since its launch in April 2017 is an achievement,” aviation analyst and expert Dhairyashil Vandekar said.

In Maharashtra, flights have started in just 28 of 48 routes. Of the six routes under UDAN for the Pune airport, only two are operational. IndiGo said it will start its long-delayed flight to Prayagraj from March 5/ An official in the know said the scheme needs a rejig. “Where is the guarantee that more flights start from the 100 airports that will be developed? Airlines have bid for existing routes, but have not started flights on many of them. There clearly are problems with the scheme, which the Centre needs to identify,” the official said.

“About 1/3 of previous UDAN allocations are operational. Prior to building 100 more airports, we need to fix and operationalize the ones already built,” Sanjiv Kapoor, former chief commercial officer of Vistara, tweeted on Sunday.

In Solapur, for instance, a sugar factory’s chimney is on the flight path and the problem remains unresolved. Solapur was assigned two RCS routes.

Availability of slots is another issue, an airline official said, adding, that recent problems, such as the grounding of Airbus A320 NEO and Boeing 737 Max, and delay in procurement of aircraft, played a part. “Almost all airlines have been hit. New flights can be started when one has a proper fleet size,” the official said.

“With proper planning and monitoring, the scheme should take off and serve its purpose in due course,” Vandekar said.

JODHPUR: Three persons were arrested on Sunday for dealing in prohibited medicines used as narcotics and psychotropic substance. Police have also seized a huge haul of these medicines from four godowns of the dealer and registered three separate cases in two police stations under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.

According to a police official, there was a spurt in the sale of these medicines after a massive crack down against smack recently in the city.

""When it came to our notice, we began our investigation by interrogating many addicts in the city and busted this racket,"" the official said. An approximate worth of these medicines has been pegged over Rs 1 crore. Police have seized about 500 bottles of Codein syrup and 1.30 lakh tablets of tramadol etc. from three places, being used by the supplier as godowns.

Those arrested include dealer Ritesh Sharma and two aides Nitin Gaur and Mohammad Khalid, who had reached one of these godowns to unload the drugs during the presence of the police.

According the police, besides these medicines, many prohibited drugs had been stocked at these godowns, which could not be sold without prescription. A team of the drug control department also rushed to the spot and began investigation in the matter. According to the officials, these medicines had been brought from Ghaziabad.

""There was no record available with the chemist about these medicines. He was not having any license to deal with the medicines either"", said an official.

The investigation revealed that chemist Sharma already had three godowns to stock these medicines and had recently hired one more place as there was an increase in demand for the drugs.

473,['3/02/2020'],Curb consumption and get govt subsidy on rooftop solar plants,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Representational Image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State government has cleared the Kerala state electricity board’s proposal to adopt plans that would limit the subsidy benefits for rooftop solar power units to consumers using only up to 200 units of energy a month.

The ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) has devised a Rs 11,814crore subsidy scheme for setting up 4,000MW of grid-connected solar roof top plants in the residential sector. The rollout of the proposed scheme is planned through state power utilities and is part of the central government’s target to achieve a cumulative capacity of 40,000MW from rooftop solar plants by 2022.

“From the national scheme, Kerala is set to receive assistance for 50MW capacity for 2019-20. KSEB can implement the project with indigenous schemes, provided the state government too agrees with it. Subsidy from the Centre would be passed on to eligible consumers interested in setting up rooftop solar plants in the size range of 2 to 3kWp. Though the allocation has been made for 2019-20, there would be an extension of the period for the project rollout, the nitty-gritties of which have recently been finalised,” said N S Pillai, KSEB chairman and managing director.

According to the scheme that got the state power department’s approval, benefit for consumers would be a financial subsidy ranging between 20 to 40% of the total cost.

For a 2 kWp plant with a project cost of Rs 1,08,000, MNRE subsidy would be Rs 43,200. While the consumer would contribute Rs 22,000 towards the project, the agency that sets up the rooftop plant would chip in Rs 36,000. KSEB would invest Rs 6,800 in a plant that makes 40% of its actual energy generation available for other consumers.

Depending on the capacity of the plant, there will be cascading changes in the subsidy benefits and investment. The life of a plant is expected to be 25 years.

Customer cost share would be 12%, 20% and 25%, depending on the plant size and scope. The board would soon start the process of choosing the beneficiaries. Consumers having monthly energy consumption from 150 to 200 units would benefit from the scheme.

Volunteers plant saplings as part of the Hero TOI Green Drive, at Jnana Bharathi campus of Bangalore Universit... Read More

BENGALURU: Morning walkers and joggers on Bangalore University ’s Jnana Bharathi campus were in for a surprise on Sunday. Hundreds of volunteers, mostly youngsters, who trooped into the fouracre vacant space behind the Sports Authority of India campus, were busy planting saplings.

The exercise was part of the Hero TOI Green Drive which added 20,000 saplings of different varieties on Sunday alone. Over the next seven days, more will be planted to make the campus richer by 1 lakh trees. In the coming years, the area will be transformed into a forest of sorts.

The volunteers were students from schools and colleges and members of NGOs and other organisations. Over 1,500 volunteers from Sant Nirankari Charitable Foundation took part in the drive and were led by their zonal in-charge Sunil Ratra.

An organiser said the saplings are desi varieties, including 30% fruit-bearing ones. “The idea is to develop the space into a biodiversity hub for birds and small animals. The saplings planted include guava, jackfruit, neem, golden shower and rain tree,” he added.

Vice-chancellor Prof KR Venugopal said the BU campus is spread over 1,162 acres and has around 12 lakh trees. “Still there are spaces that need greening. We are open to more such plantation drives,” he added.

Prajwal BP, student from an experiential learning school, said the city requires more trees for the simple reason that children like him need to breathe easy. “A biodiversity park like this enhances quality of life in a city which is fast losing its green cover,” he added.

Chandan Kumar Bhagat, a volunteer from SNCF, had come all the way from Ballari. “Planting a sapling is the greatest service one can do in today’s world,” he said.

The drive, which began in Delhi, has improved the greenery quotient of cities across the country.

After over 1 lakh saplings were planted across Delhi’s three biodiversity parks in 2015, the drive moved to Indore and Chandigarh where 2 lakh were planted in 2017. Next year, the drive covered Indore, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Delhi, and they went greener by 5 lakh trees. This is the first time that the drive is being held in Bengaluru.

During financial year 2019-20, over 2.3 lakh saplings were planted under the drive while from 2015 to 2019-20, the number was over 11.5 lakh.

477,['3/02/2020'],mark zuckerberg: This is what Facebook CEO says he will not do if had to start from scratch,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a discussion at the Silicon Slopes Tech Summit 2020 in Salt Lake City has said that if he were to start again, he will not pick Silicon Valley to establish his startup.

As per a report by CNBC, Zuckerberg said, “I do think, on balance, that if I was starting from scratch now I would not pick the Bay Area.” The report further ads that Zuckerberg feels that with things like Amazon Web Services , it has been made possible that tech companies can be build anywhere. Talking about the limitations of Silicon Valley, Zuckerberg said that lack of housing and a mono-culture make other regions more alluring.

At the same event, Mark Zuckerberg spoke about the direction in which the biggest social networking website of the world is heading. “We’re going to stand up for free expression. It’s unfortunate that this is such a controversial thing,” said Zuckerberg.

“This is the new approach, and I think it’s going to piss off a lot of people. But frankly the old approach was pissing off a lot of people too, so let’s try something different,” he added.

The said statement has been made in context to company’s stand on the political advertising where Zuckerberg clarified that Facebook is going to support free speech which essentially means that unlike other social networking websites like Twitter, Facebook is not going to ban them.

It is already known that Facebook CEO is done making New Year’s resolution and this year onwards, with a start of the new decade, Zuckerberg is going “to do something different.” Instead of making annual goals, Zuckerberg will now have long term focus which he didn’t really specify at the time. This was followed by his statement after the company announced quarterly earnings, ”My goal for this next decade isn’t to be liked, but to be understood. Because in order to be trusted, people need to know what you stand for.”

490,['3/02/2020'],"Chandigarh: Ticked off, teens took off for worse","This story is from February 3, 2020

CHANDIGARH: Reprimanded for not studying or berated for their love activities upsets some kids so much that they do not mind leaving the warm confines of their homes. Out of 1,026 children in the age group of 12 to 17 years who went missing from different parts of the city from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019, as many as 98% walked out owing to similar reasons, according to police.

Love, family fracas, financial crisis and pressure from parents for studies were the triggers behind children turning runaways (60% of them were girls). Luckily, police traced 924 children and efforts are on to find the rest of the 98 kids — a job that is not easy at all.

“The major challenge is that we have to start from scratch and sometimes these kids just do not want to return home,” cops said. Police have been running drives and forming teams to bring down the number. Nilambari Jagadale , SSP, said they run a special drive to trace missing children in January and July under ‘Operation Muskaan’ every year. The anti-human trafficking cell of UT police functions as a centralised unit to trace missing children and coordinates Muskaan too. NGOs have also been posted in the cell to strengthen it, the SSP said.

Special teams are being formed to trace missing minors under Muskaan on the directions of the ministry of home affairs since 2015. After getting a list of missing children, a Muskaan team reaches the house and takes details. The team circulates pictures of the missing child to neighbouring states and contacts shelter homes and NGOs to find the kids. The success rate has been high.

Data revealed that 16 police stations in Chandigarh registered complaints of 249 missing children in 2015, with cops being able to trace 236 children in that year itself. However, the figure came down to 196 in 2016, and 187 being traced. In 2017, police registered 201 cases and located 176 children. One child was brought back from outside the city. As many as 224 children disappeared from different parts of the city in 2018 and cops traced 198 of them. Last year, cops reunited 127 children with their families out of a total 147 missing children. Eleven children were traced from other states.

‘64 missing kids were found at railway station’

As many as 64 children who had gone missing landed up at the Chandigarh railway station and were reunited with their parents in the past one year. Rana said 41 of them were boys and the rest girls.

They were in the age group between 5 and 16 years. Rana said, “Most of the children said they had run away from their houses and reached the Chandigarh railway station. As many as 80% of these children belonged to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan.”

491,['3/02/2020'],Punjab excise policy may set liquor prices soaring,"This story is from February 3, 2020

Representative image

MOHALI: The Punjab cabinet has approved the draft of new excise policy, which focuses on stability in liquor trade and revenue protection. But, the draft policy has a bad news for the Bacchus lovers, as it is likely to drill a hole in their pockets.

Liquor traders here feel that in the present form, the new excise policy will force a hike of Rs 40 to Rs 50 per bottle, and the prices of beer bottles and cans are likely to go up by Rs 8 to Rs 10 per bottle/can.

The Punjab cabinet led by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh approved the draft of new excise policy 2020-21, with sustained focus on maintaining stability in the liquor trade while protecting the state's excise revenue.

The liquor traders said in this policy, the government has hiked the excise duty on retail, though the increase would be nominal (Rs 5 for PML, Rs 4 for IMFL and Rs 2 for beer). At wholesale stage, there is no increase in excise duty rates on PML. In the case of IMFL, the increase is approximately 5% and the duty has been enhanced from Rs 62 per bulk litre (BL) to Rs 68 for strong beer.

Liquor trader Sunny said, ""The excise policy announced by the Punjab government will lead to marginal hike in liquor rates. We are more concerned about the regular brands like Royal Stag, Blenders Pride, Royal Challenge, ACP, RUM which are hot selling but the excise duty increase will hike the bottle price by Rs 40 to Rs 50. The interest of the trader as well as the customer must be look into.""

The policy also reads that the fixed license fee of Rs 600 crore during 2019-20 will go up to to Rs 625 crore, while the additional fixed license fee of Rs 120 crore during 2019-20 is also to be increased to Rs 385 crore under the new policy.

Instead of any significant increase in the quota of different kinds of liquor, the increase has only been in the additional licence fee, because the licencees can lift quota of liquor according to their choice, out of this additional fixed licence fee.

492,['3/02/2020'],Ahmedabad: 'Ending DDT will add tax burden on HNIs',"This story is from February 3, 2020

From L: Vyas, Dholakia and Patel

AHMEDABAD: The Union budget announcement abolishing the dividend distribution tax (DDT), is expected to increase the tax burden on the high networth individuals ( HNIs ), according to eminent tax expert Mukesh Patel. Patel, along with former BJP minister, Jay Narayan Vyas; and former director of IIM Ahmedabad , Bakul Dholakia, presented the analysis of the Union Budget 2020-21 at Ahmedabad Management Association (AMA) on Sunday.

Highlighting the impact on HNIs, Patel said, ""By abolishing the DDT, higher tax will be collected from the HNIs. Till now, there was a fixed rate of 20% for DDT and if one's earning through dividend is greater than Rs 10 lakh, there was an additional tax of 10%. Therefore, the effective tax came to 30%. However, the same has now been increased and surcharges will continue. Those who earn an income of more than Rs 50 lakh will end up paying more taxes. Overall, it will have an adverse impact on individual taxpayers.""

Dholakia pointed out how the budget had little measures to curb the ongoing slowdown. ""From a GDP growth rate of 8.1%, six quarters ago, we came down to 4.5%. This is a steep fall. However, clarity of vision is missing in the Budget as far as economy is concerned.""

Vyas said, ""Shortfalls are rampant in GST and direct taxes. This is expected to hurt government spending. To revive economy, it is important that the government spends but does so strategically and judiciously.""

Ahmedabad: Cases of harassment by loan sharks continue to pour in, even though the city police have begun booking the Shylocks under PASA. Last Tuesday, one Mahesh Makwana, 33, of Behrampura was admitted in LG Hospital after he drank phenyl to commit suicide and thus escape loan sharks. Kagdapith police registered a case in the matter on Saturday under sections section of 387 and 502(2) and section 5, 40, 42 (a) and 42 (d) of Gujarat Money-Lenders Act against one Nathaji Ode of Behrampura, named as the accused by Makwana.

The accused was arrested on Saturday, the day the complaint was filed, said inspector U D Jadeja of Kagdapith police station.

""According to the FIR, about three years ago, Makwana had taken Rs 50,000 from Ode on 10% monthly interest. He has already paid back Rs 1,20,000. Even then Ode continued demanding money asserting that Makwana had only paid the interest,"" said a police official.

Last Monday night, Ode came to his house and threatened him to return his money.

Next morning, Ode again arrived at Makwana's home and asked him to pay Rs 50,000 - the principal amount. Makwana got frightened and drank phenyl in a suicide bid. ""He was shifted to LG Hospital from where he was discharged on Saturday,"" said a police source.

Inspector Jadeja said, "" The police commissioner's notification says that no one without a proper licence can lend money on interest and even if he has got a licence he should not charge more than 1.5% interest per month,"" said a police official.
