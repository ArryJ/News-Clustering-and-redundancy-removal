THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As the first step towards integrating road safety lessons in the school curriculum, Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA), National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC) and State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) have jointly published a handbook on road safety for teachers .

‘Surakshithayatra’, published with an aim to inculcate the habit of following traffic rules among students from primary class, was released by transport minister A K Saseendran recently.

“The integration of road safety rules in school syllabus has been a long-term project and it is being implemented now. The handbook for teachers is just the beginning of this initiative, which is the first ever attempt in the country. Next, mapping will be conducted on how to include the lessons in the school textbooks, as the lessons has to be different for each standard based on their class level.

For example, road safety rules can be included in social science and first aid can be part of biology,” said Rajagopal K , director, communication and public relations, Kerala Road Safety Authority. “There have been enquiries from the Centre about the handbook and we are planning to translate it to English,” he added.

The 110-page book , which begins with a note to teachers, consists of details related to safety of motorists, passengers and pedestrians, traffic rules and first aid. The matter is explained with representative picture and there are questions and answers section and activities for teachers in the book.

Around two lakh copies of the book will be printed and distributed among school teachers across the state. The handbook will be part of vacation training classes for teachers to be held in the next academic year.

“The revision of school curriculum has started as per the directive from the Centre. Regarding the integration of road safety lessons in school textbooks, decision will have to be taken whether to include the lessons in textbooks or as a separate book for children to read,” said J Prasad, director, SCERT.

As part of the activity, road safety clubs will be formed in all government schools after school reopens in the next academic year. “Road safety lessons are likely to be introduced in the curriculum in 2021-22 academic year. Road safety is a matter to be dealt at the grassroot level and integrating it in the school syllabus is the apt way to reduce the number of accidents. There are notes and pamphlets on traffic rules, but it is the first time that a detailed book for school is published. It is proposed to start the training programme for teachers in schools located near national highway and state highway for the safety of students,"" said an official from SCERT.

3,['2/02/2020'],How to whine right!,"Since our culture sees complaining as a bad habit, we have learned to be silent over the years, even when there is a reason to speak out…That’s about to change. According to a research by Robin Kowalski, professor of psychology, at Clemson University (US), complaining can be a useful tool in bonding. It even helps us process emotions like stress and frustration. The study further states that complaining, in moderation, can be used as an ice-breaker, to convey information about oneself so that others can form a particular impression of you. However, what’s essential here is to pick the right audience. Find someone you feel comfortable confiding in and make sure they support your purpose. Here are four ways of complaining the right way:When we share your story, we are making an intimate bond of friendship. This happens any time we are sharing an emotional truth about ourselves that shows where we are vulnerable. It makes the listener empathetic to our feelings. And that’s a great vehicle for bonding.Journal about the things that are upsetting you or speak to a friend. Be honest. Take time to choose the person with deep care. While complaining, try to understand yourself too. Author Tina Gilbertson writes in her book, How To Beat Bad Feelings By Letting Yourself Have Them: Ask yourself what upsets you? Tell the truth in one sentence.While complaining is, ideally, solution-based, venting is not as focused on solving problems. But that doesn’t mean venting is bad. At times, you should vent because it’s cathartic. The positive benefits of venting are immediate:it allows you to unload and offload emotional weight, thereby, reducing stress and unhappiness. But after that, make sure the complaining gets solution-oriented.Remember that voicing too many expressive complaints gets you into a loop of negative emotion. Modern life gives rise to lots of complaints, but how many of us do a good job of it?When done effectively, it can help you clearly realise what specifically is bothering you. Possibly, because you are hearing yourself speak out loud. Or, the person you are speaking to gives you a perspective you didn’t think of since you were too wrapped up in your own feelings. The research discovered that emotional disclosure is important, but the way in which you disclose it is what determines whether the interaction has a positive or negative impact. Make your complaints short and to the point. Happy people complain to find solutions.There is no passive waiting and dwelling about this kind of complaining. This is solution-based and is done with an actionable goal. People with high self-esteem tend to be instrumental complainers, perhaps, because they are more confident that voicing their complaint can improve things.But while at it, remember not to rant. Effective complaints tend to be concise, fact-based, directed at the right person at the right time and focused on a particular goal. Also, make your complaint directly to the person who has the power to fix it.Journal about the things that are upsetting you or speak to a friend. Be honest. Take time to choose the person with deep care. While complaining, try to understand yourself too.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73805644,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-236842/73805644.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/how-to-whine-right/articleshow/73805644.cms
4,['2/02/2020'],Pawan Shankar to make his Bollywood debut soon,"Actor Pawan Shankar, who recently returned to TV after a break of six years, is all set for his Bollywood debut. His track in the show, 'Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega', has ended and he will next be seen on the big screen — in the Ajay Devgn and Sanjay Dutt-starrer, 'Bhuj — The Pride Of India'. Talking about his role, Pawan says, “I am playing Omani, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief, who instigated the Kutch attack during the India-Pakistan war in 1971 and destroyed the runway at the Bhuj airport . It is one of the biggest roles of my career, and I am excited to work with such talented co-stars. Director Abhishek Dudhaiya had seen my work in the TV show 'Siddhanth' (2004) and wanted to cast me in his film.”While Pawan has played the lead role in TV shows, he is playing the antagonist in this film. Does he have any apprehensions about turning negative on screen? He says, “In today’s cinema, the antagonist doesn’t have any particular image. In fact, lead actors are playing both protagonists and antagonists. Saif Ali Khan is among the actors, who have played both kind of roles equally well.”Pawan says that shooting for a film is different from shooting for a TV show. “In films, you finish each shot with precision and accuracy, and the quality of equipment is superlative. On TV, there is so much content to be wrapped up in a day and so, we have to compromise on the performance. Ek baar mein jo de diya, de diya; shot dekhne ka bhi time nahi hota.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73837857,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-57442/73837857.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/pawan-shankar-to-make-his-bollywood-debut-soon/articleshow/73837907.cms

7,['2/02/2020'],Gentleman blends comedy and realistic element: Prajwal Devaraj,"For the team of Gentleman, the film is rather special — director Guru Deshpande turned producer, actors Prajwal Devaraj and Nishvika Naidu took on roles that challenged each of them, and director Jadesh Kumar attempted to present a unique story about a man with a sleeping disorder, who has to battle an issue. Naturally, each of them is excited about what they bring to the table, which was palpable, when they dropped by our office for a quick chat ahead of the film’s release on February 7. Excerpts from our conversation:Gentleman is a story that revolves around a man with the sleeping beauty syndrome. It follows Bharath , who is plagued by the syndrome and ends up sleeping for 18 hours a day. How he leads his life in the six hours that he is awake and the issues he faces form the theme of the story.The inspiration for the story was a news article we came across back in 2010 about a man who actually suffers from the syndrome. Jadesh worked on this for 10 years to develop a story that I decided to back as producer.To explain Gentleman, one has to begin with the title. In society, everyone wants to be gentleman, and in our film, we have a protagonist who has all of six hours in a day to prove that he is a gentleman. He fights a mafia, falls in love with a girl and has to give time to his family. In that sense, Gentleman is the perfect blend of commercial and realistic elements — a power-packed movie, which will not disappoint anyone.I play Tapaswini, who is very responsible and disciplined. In comparison to my earlier outings, this is a very different character for me. She is also a dietitian, who is very health conscious.When I first heard the story, I was very impressed by the subject, as I had never heard about the syndrome. I have done enough research that is required of me as an actor in presenting this onscreen. Strangely, after the trailer was launched, a former classmate reached out to me to tell me that her husband suffers from the syndrome.In India, there are probably 10 reported cases of the syndrome. In the film, though, we have represented it as the first case to be reported in Karnataka . We worked on the script for a year to ensure that Prajwal would truly embody everything that someone with the syndrome does. But that doesn’t mean that the film is only about his medical condition; it is as much about how he finds it difficult to find time for his love, family and his personal life. Amid all the drama, he even fights against a human trafficking mafia, which gives a thrilling edge to the tale.Honestly, I had no idea that such a syndrome or the mafia angle explored in this film existed in the real world.After we released the teaser, we got a call from someone called Rajeev who has the syndrome and sleeps for 20 hours a day. He also shared videos with us. As it turns out, there is another guy called Ajay from Belagavi who has the syndrome. People are now eagerly waiting to see the movie, as they want to know what solution we have given to the syndrome.It was easy, because the character is rather novel. He needs to do whatever is required of him in six hours. There is also a thriller element in it, which keeps audiences hooked.The movie also highlights relationships. There is a child called Aradhya in the film, whose role will strike a chord with audiences.Prajwal, you were made to shoot in a garbage dump and in a sewer drain....The location that we shot at had such huge mounds of garbage that we needed to bring earth mover equipment to clear some and make space for us to shoot. Imagine moving waste that has been decomposing for long — that raised quite a stench — and then having to shoot there the whole day. One of the sequences required me to sleep on piles of waste, which was quite challenging.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73842075,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-196410/73842075.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/gentleman-blends-comedy-and-realistic-element-prajwal-devaraj/articleshow/73842086.cms

But, he admits that he is content with singing 10-12 good songs in a year, unlike his contemporaries. During his recent visit to Bengaluru, he explains that the discretion in his selection of the work he takes up is deliberate. Excerpts...I have to be selective; it's my nature. I do not want to have a career that boasts a great number of songs. I'd be happy if it is a selected few that stand out with good lyrics, composers and film teams. This has worked for me since the past two decades. Lyrics have to be very good. That is my only condition to sing.People email and message me whenever my new songs come up. I try to feel the pulse when I am out at an event or a concert. Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior has become a major hit. When my song Maay Bhavani , played on screen, people threw coins to show their appreciation. When I get to know about the success of a song, I go ahead and sign the next one. My musical journey has turned out to be great so far. It is slow and steady, but energetic.The song has to be good. If there is a Punjabi song in every other movie today, it doesn't mean that the song is good. Every Punjabi song is not running successfully. If the song is very good, it will work well, irrespective of the language it has been sung in.AR Rahman is the one who introduced me to world music. He launched me and I have great love and regards for him. I don't know much about his state of mind now or when we will work together again.I don't mind them, nor do I mind singing remixes. But, I've not been approached to sing any remix yet. I think Chaiyya Chaiyya will sound good if remixed. If and when I do get an opportunity to sing a remix, I am sure it will sound great.I am more energetic when I perform in a city that has great weather. And, the weather in Bengaluru is perfect.

11,['2/02/2020'],It was Sanam who asked me to keep our engagement confidential: Tharshan,"Bigg Boss Tamil Season 3 fame Tharshan Thiyagarajah, who was accused of physical and mental harassment by his former fiancée Sanam Shetty , has now come out asserting that her allegations are untrue. He trashes Sanam’s accusation of him hiding their engagement and avers that it’s she who asked him not to open up about the same for three years. Tharshan also adds that the wedding was called off as he couldn’t handle the pressure from Sanam after coming out of the reality show. He opens up on how they met, the conditions she laid down when they got engaged, what went wrong, and more…First of all, I had no intention of hiding our engagement. But she insisted I do not make it public for three years as she thought it would affect her movie offers. Even otherwise, I don’t believe in talking about personal things in public, so I was okay with it. Her parents, too, requested me to keep it confidential.Both of us had sent our profiles together for the third season of the show but hers was rejected. She even tried to influence them through one of her relatives, who is a politician. The wedding was supposed to take place in June last year, but it didn’t happen because I went to participate in the show. I thought she might get a wild card entry, but that too didn’t happen. Sanam didn’t like my relationship with Sherin in the house though she was only a good friend. Later, when I explained my relationship with Sanam to Sherin, she stayed away from me as she didn’t want her name to be dragged into this. But after I came out of the house, I was taken aback by Sanam’s change in behaviour. I started getting affected mentally because of her pressure to announce our relationship to the public. Moreover, she insisted that I take her with me wherever I went. She used to force me to book business-class tickets whenever I went abroad. She also asked me to refer her for the movie offers that came my way.It’s been more than a couple of months now. When we decided to break up, she again insisted that I talk about it to the media. I was not comfortable with it and told her the same. I said I will talk about this to her parents, but not to the public. Her allegation that my parents threatened her is completely untrue. If I have parents who can threaten others with their influence or power, why would I struggle for a chance in commercials and movies?To be honest, I am clueless about it. Apart from the suicide threats that she came up with, she used to tell me that she’d take revenge on me. That’s why I didn’t make our relationship pubic. There have been instances where she went to production houses and claimed that I cheated her. Once, she even told me that she will do everything to curtail my growth as I hail from a different country.The movie has been temporarily shelved due to financial crisis. She claims she has splurged on me. If she had that much money, she could have used it for the project and finished it. She spent only around `3.5 lakh for my employment visa and I returned the money to her later. She has been saying she helped me with her career, which is another lie. I had enough commercials and movies, some of which had me playing crucial roles. My family also used to send me money.I don’t know who her co-stars are and I never ask her where she goes and who she works with.Whatever said and done, I’m still grateful to her because she did suggest my name for some of the assignments I was part of. I have great respect for her parents, too.

12,['2/02/2020'],"When in doubt, go for sprouts","When you see sprouts, think “nutrient dense”, that too in one small serving. Sprouts that bud from a seed hold the most nutrients because that seed has the power to grow into an entire plant eventually. It is rich in minerals, vitamins, enzymes, antioxidants, amino acids and several other nutrients making them burst with folate, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese and vitamins C, A, K — however, it may vary based on the type of sprout. Nevertheless, every kind of sprout can be a super healthy addition to your daily meals.The process of “sprouting” or germination is what holds real value here. When seeds are soaked in water, they sprout into very young plants due to the moisture present that softens the outer layers of the seed. This process helps unlock and increase the nutrition value multi-fold – this is what makes sprouts so healthy.- Since sprouting needs a good amount of soaking, it helps get rid of anti nutritional factors like phytic acid thereby unlocking all the nutrients and making it more bio available.- It enhances the nutritional value of the seed. - It is super rich in live enzymes that can aid digestion and break down food more effectively.- Sprouting can make a particular lentil or legume easy to digest. During sprouting, specific complex compounds are broken down into simpler forms and undesirable substances are rendered inactive which makes sprouts easily digestible. This is why sprouts is also called a pre-digested food.- Sprouting makes proteins easy to digest.- Sprouts are rich in folate and can help boost haemoglobin levels.- It is a great way to add fibre to meals.You can practically sprout any seed.

13,['2/02/2020'],Tattoos you can hear,"Permanent body art, never sounded better. Literally. Thanks to the growing trend of soundwave tattoos that are making waves. Launched in 2017 by an LA-based company, Skin Motion, it uses an app to convert audio files to soundwaves that you can get etched on to the skin and with the help of the app play it back. It can be your favourite music, voice/s of a loved one/s or anything that you care about.Inventor Nate Siggard revealed that he already has a recording of his child’s infectious laughter on his leg. Another YouTube clip published by the company shows a tattoo artist who got her dog’s bark on her arm. The tattoo even adorns Canadian singer/songwriter sensation Shawn Mendes who got a guitar — his signature instrument — etched on his arm. The very top of the guitar is a soundwave of his parents voices saying ‘I love you’.Celebrity tattoo artist Sunny Bhanushali explains, “Soundwaves are visual representation or a diagram of a voice or sound produced. These diagrams are inked on the skin and when you scan with a device you can hear the message behind the diagram.” He calls it a trending tattoo and people are picking to go for the voice of a loved one, or a line of their favourite song.Even as the tattoos continue to make big noise, many claim that the clips don’t work as well as promised. But that’s not dampening their demand. Bhanushali says that he’s getting queries everyday regarding these audio tattoos. His advice: keep the audio short – maybe 3 to 5 words max, and get it at a safe spot (avoid wrist or neck). “These are very emotional tattoos. You can hear the voice of the person when you scan them. Spots like thighs or forearms are perfect for these tattoos. It’s definitely going to be popular with the millennials,” he predicts. Other tattoos that are doing well right now are armband and minimal tattoos.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73807775,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-211574/73807775.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/beauty/tattoos-you-can-hear/articleshow/73807697.cms
14,['2/02/2020'],Farm to table(t)?,"Haven’t the last couple of years been a back-to-the-pediatrician kind of experience with everyone out there reminding us to “eat our vegetables”? While many amongst us have happily warmed up to the idea of seeing more of kale and moringa in our food, picky eaters are still fighting the idea. A trend catering to the latter population is wellness shots, pills and gummies. “Your daily serving of greens” is the claim most of them go around with. Can’t eat your veggies? Just down a shot of greens or chew on a superfood gummy. From delivering Ayurvedic pills customised to your dosha to your personalised batch of adaptogen and herby fizz, wellness comes in mindboggling packages these days.Wellness shots and gummies are actually preserved condensed versions of juices, plant extracts or drinking vinegars that are gaining popularity for being easy to consume, palatable and pleasant to the eye. Since they look more like candy or a mocktail and can be consumed on the go, people are easily buying the idea of considering them as a good alternative to supplements or even the inability to meet their dietary requirements. Almost every medically beneficial herb or food including ashwagandha, asafoetida, carom seeds, apple cider vinegar, ginger, turmeric, wheatgrass, cherry juice, cranberry and a hundred others are available as these shots and gummies.Their beneficial effect as a complete product is debatable. Currently, there are no scientific claims suggesting their actual nutrient content. Studies only highlight the benefits of the main ingredient on which the particular product is based. But a question remains: how jas the processing, along with additional colours and preservatives affected the efficacy of that medicinal food or plant? To sum up, wellness gummies and shots may be used to serve as a quick dose of energy, refreshment or just to feel good but they should not be considered as the desired nutrition your body needs.No supplement/ gummies or wellness shakes can be a substitute for healthy food. Our body is naturally developed to consume, digest and assimilate food to get its dietary requirements. From the bacteria in the gut lining to saliva in the mouth and from the digestive enzymes to the digestive organs such as liver, stomach, pancreas and more, the gastrointestinal tract is aligned to digest and absorb nutrients from food and not really from extracts. You can still consume them between meals or when you are low in energy or feel tired.— With inputs from Manjari Chandra, clinical nutritionistLeafy greens: Spinach, kale, collards, parsleySeaweed: Spirulina, chlorella, dulse, kelpOther vegetables: Broccoli, beets, carrots, tomatoes, green cabbageGrasses: Barley grass, wheatgrass, oat grass, alfalfa grass",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73803911,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1183471/73803911.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/diet/farm-to-tablet/articleshow/73803938.cms

At a recent event in the city, Sudha Murty was in good company — she had her pet labrador Gopi with her. So, she also took the opportunity to speak about the special bond she shares with her pet, whom she had even taken along when she was being featured on actor Ramesh Aravind ’s chat show. “I recite poems to Gopi, which keep him entertained. I also tell him stories and sing lullabies too. I do not know if he enjoys listening to them or if he listens to them at all, but I like doing that. The only thing he does want after it all is something to eat. But spending time with him and talking to him is enjoyable,” says Sudha, adding how Gopi once mistook an egg for a ball when he was given one for the first time in their vegetarian household.

The joy of having a pet, she adds, is something all children should experience, ideally as early as possible. “I request all parents with young children to adopt pets at home, if possible. When one has pets, they need to be responsible, as there are activities that need to be tended to. Children in these homes grow up quickly, as they learn to be more responsible,” she explains.

The actor recently shared a heartfelt video with fans and well-wishers, where he reflected on his journey so far; how it all began without any fanfare and how he has worked his way up in the industry. “The journey has seen me face both bouquets and brickbats and nothing was easy or came as I willed. I’ve had to work for it and now, when I see fans celebrate and dance in front of the screen for my films, I am filled with gratitude. My only wish has been to do varied roles in different avatars to entertain you,” he said, adding that he’s glad he’s made it here.Sudeep also candidly added, “If I have to consider this journey as a bus, there have been many people who have travelled along with me. While many have remained with me, some have left midway. I miss those who have moved on. As for those who have stayed by my side, I’m happy to say you complete me.”The candid confessions continued as Sudeep said, “I never thought I would be completing 25 years here.” He added, “It would be lies if I say I didn’t run behind box-office collections or the number game. But I will say that today it does not matter any more. I am happy with creative satisfaction that translates into appreciation from fans. By the end of my journey, I don’t want to be the most successful person, but the one who is the most admired.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73841776,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-210199/73841776.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/i-never-thought-id-complete-25-years-in-showbiz-sudeep/articleshow/73841741.cms

21,['2/02/2020'],In the loop,"Think of crochet and it probably reminds you of simpler times – of mom’s hand-knitted sweaters, homemade pickles and the humble sewing machine. Sunday afternoons were spent lazing in the sun with your mother or grandmother crocheting away busily to fashion caps, tablecloths and what not. And with the return of all things handmade, crochet is making a big comeback – if current spring-summer trends are to be believed. The hand-knitted goodness was seen on the ramps for Salvatore Ferragamo, Marni, Kate Spade New York, Fendi, Gabriela Hearst and Jil Sander. As always, fast fashion brands picked up on the trend to launch their versions of crochet chic and upcycling enthusiasts tried their hands at it to craft handbags, coasters, mats and more – all with the humble hook.While, personally, you may not have thought of crochet since you were a kid, high fashion is taking it seriously. The spring-summer is going to see a slew of crochet variants in sexy, feminine dresses with enough holes to make sure you stay (and look) cool in the hot months ahead.HOOK, LINE AND SINKERCrochet is a French term meaning ‘small hook’. Hooks can be made from a variety of materials, such as metal, wood, bamboo, or plastic. The key difference between crochet and knitting, beyond the implements used for their production, is that each stitch in crochet is completed before the next one is begun, while knitting keeps many stitches open at a time. And practitioners claim that it is simpler than knitting.Some variants such as Tunisian crochet or broomstick lace, keep multiple stitches open similar to knitting.The spring fashion update is in the form of ultra-feminine dresses, polished suiting, and even eveningwear that feels modern with a touch of grandma’s handmade crochet. As the fashion industry is searching for ways to be more sustainable, this trend ticks all the right boxes. It’s slow, handmade, uses upcycled material – it screams sustainability. Upcyclers like Swati Soharia and Chindi have crafted bags and baskets out of discarded materials using crochet stitches. Irish designer Colin Burke does exquisite handmade crochet to create signature winterwear that looks luxurious. Crafters are even using it to create toys and hair accessories. Last summer, crochet bikinis were an Instagram favourite. Even crochet in textile jewellery — with big necklaces and earrings — is making waves right now.CROCHET CHICWith the quest for handmade, homespun feel in clothes becoming stronger, it is seeing resurgence of age-old techniques like quilting, knitting, applique, patchwork, kantha and more. The fibre art being picked up by high fashion transports it to haute couture.At Altuzarra and Giambattista Valli, crochet was seen in skin-baring crops and bra tops. Stella McCartney created lace-like crochet dresses with plunging necklines. True to its brand ethos, Kate Spade New York showcased long crochet dresses and skirts in bright colours paired with button-up shirts for a grown-up look. Meanwhile, Marni styled artful pieces with loosely-crocheted yarns over slinky silk to create a juxtaposition of textures.But it’s not a look for the faint-hearted given the fact that it is a bit see-through but nothing a little soft lining can’t cover. A crochet outfit is usually boho with a resort and lounge-y feel – a reason why you can have as much fun with the outfit as you want. Pair with flip-flops, hoop earrings, heels or sneakers – it’s a look you can dress up or down. It’s also Instagram gold with many people showcasing their art of crochet and a gazillion YouTube videos to help you get started. Incidentally celebrities like Meryl Streep, Debra Messing, Jane Seymour and Eva Longoria are hooked to their hook. It’s time you gave it a try.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73803756,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-152161/73803756.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/buzz/in-the-loop/articleshow/73802993.cms

23,['2/02/2020'],How can we combat compassion fatigue?,"Feeling burdened by the suffering of others

Blaming others for their suffering

Isolating yourself

Loss of pleasure in life

Difficulty concentrating

Insomnia

Physical and mental fatigue

Bottling up your emotions

Increased nightmares

Feelings of hopelessness or powerlessness

Frequent complaining about your work or your life

Overeating

Excessive use of drugs or alcohol

Poor self-care

Denial

Beginning to receive a lot of complaints about your work or attitude

Is it too early to be talking about surviving 2020? After all, we are just in the second month – with 10 more to go. But if you were to heed political comedian Hasan Minhaj’s advice, we are all suffering from compassion fatigue. What might that be? In his last episode of 2019, Minhaj talked about managing the 24-hour depressing news cycle around us. He said: “We are exposed to all the news, all the time, which makes us feel like we need to care about everything – all the time…”Don’t you feel this? It’s not as if these issues don’t matter. “But we can’t possibly care about all of them – all the time. It’s like we have 50 tabs open in our mental browsers and we are about to crash,” he added. That’s compassion fatigue. And something’s got to change. But what?Trauma therapist Ruchita Chandrashekar has seen this fatigue building up in the younger demographic (that is consuming information at a breakneck speed). “The exhaustion you feel at the exposure to other’s pain is real. It’s accompanied with a feeling of doom – you are pre-occupied with what’s happening, are prone to sudden mood swings, feel helpless and are wracked with guilt for not doing enough,” she says.Midlife coach Vaibhav Datar pinpoints social media as one of the main reasons for the current feeling of doom. “Physiologically, people are more triggered by negative news. The constant availability of news on cell phones, constant bombardment of negative news on social media, the ease of multiple apps, have all helped in propelling negativity, illusion and stress within the mind of every individual – especially millennials,” he says.A feeling of secondary stress in the consumer of news has been proven in many studies. Delhi-based psychiatrist Dr Shobhana Mittal notes, HOW you consume information is a reason why people are feeling more burdened. “A big chunk of information is reaching us through our smartphones, that are often accessed during ‘leisure time’ from a personal space (like one’s bedroom), at a personal time (say at bedtime), when one has his/her guards down. None of us are emotionally prepared to see stressful content at such a time,” she adds.Also, most social media content can be more graphic and visceral than the newspaper, and the comment section is negative and abusive in nature. Chandrashekar says that visceral images, graphic videos tend to have a deeper impact than reading news. Hence, one of the key areas to focus on in combatting compassion fatigue, is our relationship and time with our smartphones.Some signs that you are veering towards this fatigue are: feeling fearful, developing a tendency to wander off and showing escapist traits. A recent research from the University of Michigan and the University of Rochester Medical Center found that empathy among students has declined by more than 40 per cent compared to the late 1970s. Dr Amit Sood, professor of medicine at Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, explains why this has happened to us all over the world. In his book, The Mayo Clinic Guide to Stress-Free Living, he says, “We are inundated with graphic images of unimaginable suffering of millions. We can fathom the suffering of a few, but a million becomes a statistic that numbs us.” The fatigue sets in.Being invested in the news cycle remotely is unpaid, unaccounted labour that takes up your time and mind space. The best way to deal with it all is to switch off. In today’s time we can’t go off our phone, but a good way is to start with 20 minutes. Chandrashekar suggests, use an app to lock your phone away and do some recreational activity that preferably doesn’t involve a screen. She calls it 20-minute active disengagement. Life coach and author Simrun Chopra says, “Stay with something you have read or watched for five minutes to process it better. When you read something, focus, stop, think it over, and once you’ve truly consumed it, move on.”List out your personal strengths, journal, seek therapy to build up your “emotional endurance”. Now, more than ever, you need to regroup with like-minded people. “And every week, make it a point to check-in with them, and yourself, about how you are feeling,” says Chandrashekar.Chopra says that the power is in your hands – your phone. Her survival tips: no notifications, dedicated time for phone use and designated verified sites and select news sources to manage information overload. “What you repost, share and write makes a difference. If you are a person of influence, ask yourself: is what I am putting up making a positive difference? Don’t give in to the social need to keep posting,” she adds.Datar agrees, “There are so many people who are ‘cool’ even though they do not regularly update on their social media accounts. There is no compulsion to be cool, to be the learned and scholarly man on the net. What you do in your real life is more important than what you do in your social media life.” As Minhaj says... it is FOCUS that will save you in 2020.Physiologically, people are more triggered by negative news. The constant availability of news on cell phones, social media, have helped in propelling negativity, stress within the mind of every individual – especially millennials—Vaibhav Datar, midlife coachIn 1980, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, claimed “knowing of others’ traumas can be traumatising”. The article claimed that proximity to trauma could itself be damaging much like secondhand smoke. Clinically, compassion fatigue is a secondary traumatic stress (STS) characterised by a gradual lessening of compassion over time. At a time where every tragedy is instantly broadcast directly into your home through TVs, laptops, smartphones, the scope of compassion fatigue has increased in mammoth proportions.To see where you fall on the compassion satisfaction/fatigue continuum, take the Professional Quality of Life (www.proqol.org) questionnaire developed by Dr Beth Hundall Stamm, one of the world’s leading experts on compassion fatigue— Psychology Today",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73803838,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-210662/73803838.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/how-can-we-combat-compassion-fatigue/articleshow/73803952.cms

25,['2/02/2020'],Ganesh Acharya files a counter complaint against assistant choreographer,"Five days after a 33-year-old assistant choreographer filed a non-cognisable offence against Bollywood choreographer Ganesh Acharya , who is also the general secretary of the Indian Film and Television Choreographers Association (IFTCA), for allegedly expelling her membership, depriving her of work, demanding commission and forcing her to watch adult videos, Acharya has now filed a counter NC against her. The lady also approached the National Commission for Women a few days ago against Ganesh.Talking about the issue, she said, “I started working as a coordinator for dancers in November 2019. However, because of certain issues in the past, Ganesh Acharya, who is the general secretary of IFTCA, used his position to expel me from the association and also directed other members to stop working with me, because I refused to give him commission. I am sitting at home unemployed since two months. That’s when I approached Sarojji (Khan), who assured me that they would look into the matter at the Special General Meeting (SGM), which was held on Sunday. While I was sitting in the corridor waiting to present my side of the story, Ganesh came out and started screaming. He said, ‘Yeh kya kar rahi hai yahaan par?

Two women assaulted me on his instructions.”She added, “In my complaint to NCW, I have also stated that Ganesh, who would often be found watching adult videos every time I visited his office, forced me to watch them, too. I reprimanded him and told him that if he ever repeated it or called me, I would file a complaint against him with the association and the police.”BT spoke to Ganesh Acharya, who said, “She was part of a group of dancers I worked with in 2007. Apart from that, I don’t know this girl at all. The accusations of assault in my presence and on my instructions are false, as I had left for a shoot before the altercation between her and the two others took place.”Regarding the accusations of expelling her because she didn’t agree to pay him a commission and forcing her to watch adult videos, he said, “The decision to expel a member is taken after everyone’s consent, and she was expelled owing to her crude and unflattering remarks on dance masters. I am against the practice of commission and don’t work with coordinators, so why will I demand commission from her? Disgruntled by the termination of her membership, she sent letters and notices to IFTCA and its members making false and frivolous allegations of not letting her work and harassing her. However, in these alleged complaints, there was no mention of her latest cooked-up story of porn videos being shown to her. Her accusations are false and baseless.”Ganesh’s lawyer, Ravi Suryawanshi, said, “We have given a written complaint to the Oshiwara Police on January 31 against her for defamation and filed an NC for the same. We have also lodged a complaint at Amboli police station against her for filing a false complaint. Ganesh Acharya will soon be initiating legal proceedings against her and her accomplices.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73839203,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-47623/73839203.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/ganesh-acharya-files-a-counter-complaint-against-assistant-choreographer/articleshow/73839220.cms

He says, “That isn’t a benchmark of your talent or success. I have been offered many title roles, but I have never taken them up just for the sake of it. I am secure as an actor.” He is also unperturbed by the fact that the Beyhadh 2 hasn’t managed to rake in the desired ratings. The actor shares, “We were prepared for this, as the show didn’t fetch great ratings on TV even last year. However, the response I get from people is very good. In any case, TV shows don’t enjoy the kind of ratings they used to a decade ago. Also, there is no standard formula to know whether a show will strike a chord with the audience or not. All I can do is give it my 100 per cent and leave the rest to the audience.”Given that his show revolves around love, obsession and revenge, we ask Shivin for his views on matters of the heart. And, he replies, “The definition of love changes with time. You could be possessive, obsessive or sensitive, depending on what you feel about the other person at a particular point.”So, what’s his relationship status? “As of now, I am too focused on work to make space for another person. Even if I were to fall in love with someone, I won’t be able to give time to the relationship at this point.

30,['2/02/2020'],Lobera To Say Final Goodbye,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Panaji: Not every successful story has a happy ending.

In the two full seasons that Sergio Lobera was at the helm of affairs, FC Goa played the most beautiful football and recently clocked 100 goals under him—a first for a coach in the Indian Super League (ISL). Semifinal in the first season, final in the second and a Super Cup trophy too. If that wasn’t enough, the team has now climbed to the top of the ISL ladder and could become the first from India to play in the high-profile AFC Champions League.

If and when that happens, Lobera won’t be around.

FC Goa and the Spanish coach, along with his assistants, Jesus Tato and Manuel Sayabera, mutually parted ways on Saturday. News of the Spanish coach’s exit was doing the rounds since Friday evening, but a confirmation came only more than 24 hours later, at 11pm on Saturday.

“The club would like to thank Sergio and his coaching team for their service over the last two and a half seasons and wish them well for the future. FC Goa won the Super Cup last year under his guidance and finished runners-up in the ISL last season,” the club said in a statement.

Club president Akshay Tandon thanked the coach and his team for their work. “Our objectives when Sergio came in were to instill a style of football and build a platform on which we would move forward as a club and we managed to achieve that consistently,” he said.

Lobera will meet the players and existing support staff for one last time on Sunday and wish them luck for the rest of the season. The Spanish coach is expected to turn up at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim before training session and say goodbye.

If the league organisers approve, Derrick Pereira will take over as the interim coach. Current assistant coach Clifford Miranda is another option, to tick the box, with Derrick still calling the shots.

Panaji: Sergio Lobera and his team has termed FC Goa ’s decision to part ways with them as “unfortunate,” and even though they said they respect the decision, the trio are unhappy.

“We obviously respect the club’s decision in the exact same ways we respected the decision to hire us thereupon. However, we admit to be really unhappy about this decision because we will not be able to enjoy and share with the team the greatest moments we are sure are yet to come,” Lobera and his assistants – Jesus Tato and Manuel Sayabera – said in their official media statement late on Saturday.

“We would like to thank the club for the trust placed in all of us, as well as for giving us the opportunity to work in such an exciting project in which we take great pride. We are also quite proud not only of the work we have performed within this time, but also to be a significant part of the club’s success, as long as we have done our best to place the club at the top of the Indian football, not only by achieving sporting success, but also by setting a well-recognised, respected and admired style of football in the whole county.

“Unfortunately, the club informed us recently that they are willing to separate our ways from now on, since they are confident is the best interests of the club for the present seasons and for the future as well,” the coaches said, wishing the club, team, fans and players deserving success.

Lobera and his assistants will meet the team at the GMC Athletic Stadium in Bambolim before the training session starts on Saturday. They are then expected to leave for Spain.

32,['2/02/2020'],Income Tax Slabs: Are you richer or poorer?,"Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman (file photo)

The answer to the question above depends on your level of income, whether you use tax-saving investments, and if so, to what extent. The Budget gives all taxpayers the option of migrating to a new scheme. For incomes up to Rs 15 lakh, you do get a lower tax rate, but this means you cannot avail of deductions and exemptions, ranging from HRA and standard deduction to those for investments under section 80C or medical insurance premium under Section 80D. That clearly involves a trade-off.For instance, income between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7.5 lakh annually will be taxed at 10% in the new regime instead of the 20% you would pay under the current scheme (which continues as an option). If you have an annual income of Rs 7.5 lakh, this translates into a saving of Rs 25,000 in tax. Add the cess of 4% and you get a total saving of Rs 26,000. However, this is possible only if you are not claiming any deductions or exemptions. If you are claiming Rs 1.25 lakh or more as deductions or exemptions, say for standard deduction (flat Rs 50,000 is allowed) plus other deductions under Section 80C — say for PF, LIC premium or home loan interest — then it is best to continue under the current regime because the gain will be more than offset by the addition to taxable income.Let us go forward. If you have an annual income of Rs 10 lakh, this translates into a saving of Rs 39,000 – assuming that you haven’t claimed any deductions or exemptions. But, typically an individual would avail of a standard deduction and have some investments. So, if you are claiming Rs 1.87 lakh or more as deductions/exemptions, again, it is best not to switch.Union Budget 2020: Full text of Nirmala Sitharaman's speechPensioners and new entrants to the job market, who have no investments in tax-saving schemes or HRA and LTA benefits may gain under the new tax regime.However, another key change could have a larger and most often adverse impact. This is in the treatment of dividend income. As a recipient, you paid no tax on dividend income if it was less than Rs 10 lakh per year. Rich shareholders paid tax on their dividend income exceeding Rs 10 lakh at the rate of 10% plus applicable surcharge and cess. That will change.All shareholders will have to bear tax on their dividend income. It will be added to their taxable income and taxed at the applicable slab rate. The more your dividend income and the higher your tax bracket, the larger this impact. At Rs 10 lakh dividend and an annual income of just above Rs 50 lakh, for instance, the extra tax liability would be Rs 3.4 lakh.The Budget also impacts you through higher customs duties on a whole range of imported products, from footwear to electronics, furniture, wall fans, kitchenware, as well as some alcoholic beverages. All of these could get costlier.On the whole, given the variables involved, its best for each taxpayer to work out individually whether the Budget leaves her poorer or richer. It’s complicated.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73855627,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1652947,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/taxing-question-are-you-richer-or-poorer/articleshow/73855352.cms

35,['2/02/2020'],Tax charter will spell out what your rights are,"This story is from February 2, 2020

The decision to introduce a taxpayer’s charter as a part of a statute is being viewed as a positive step. A charter defines the rights of a taxpayer and the obligations of the tax department.

Hitesh Gajaria, co-head of tax at KPMG India, said: “While the contours of the charter have not yet been defined, it will lead to greater accountability and send a strong signal that the government intends to be taxpayer-friendly.”

“We wish to enshrine in the statute a taxpayer charter through this Budget. Our government remains committed to taking measures to ensure that our taxpayers are free from tax harassment of any kind,” Sitharaman said in her budget speech.

In a recent report, the International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation had stated that to ensure that the taxpayers’ rights were protected in the real sense, the enactment of such a charter was necessary. As many as 40 countries (of the 42 surveyed) had a charter in place, but only in 33% of these was it legally effective.

Countries like Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Italy, Kenya and Mexico have the charter as a part of their statute, akin to the proposal made by the finance minister. While Australia and Canada do have a charter in place, it doesn’t have the protection of an Act. The Netherlands, on the other hand, has avoided a charter altogether, claiming that taxpayers' rights are sufficiently recorded under various tax laws.

Sitharaman said that any tax system required trust between the taxpayers and the administration, adding that this could be possible only when the rights of the former were clearly enumerated.

GOVT MATH DOESN’T FULLY ADD UP, SAY EXPERTS

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday proposed to introduce new tax slabs with reduced rates for an annual income of up to Rs 15 lakh for those foregoing exemptions and deductions under a “simplified tax regime”. The new system is, however, optional and will co-exist with the old one with three slabs and various exemptions and deductions.Sitharaman said those availing of deductions and exemptions might choose to go for status quo and pay tax as per the old regime. If you are a businessman and opt for the new regime , you can go back to the old system, but only once. However, for the salaried, there is no such restriction.Sitharaman indicated that the government intended to remove all IT exemptions in the long run. She said the government had reviewed over 100 exemptions and deductions and removed around 70. “We will review and rationalise the remaining exemptions and deductions in the coming years with a view to further simplifying the tax system and lowering the tax rate,’’ she said.However, a lowering of the tax rates isn’t a win-win for all taxpayers. Simply put, the “simplified” tax regime is not that simple. For an annual income of up to Rs 6 lakh, the tax liability under the new regime will be higher than that in the old system. This is because a standard deduction of Rs 50,000 allowed earlier is missing under the new regime. Therefore, the tax liability will be the same in both systems only up to an annual income of Rs 6 lakh. For other slabs, even the statutory savings under Employees’ Provident Fund and life-insurance buys make the old system attractive due to the exemptions.For example, if X has a total income of Rs 7.5 lakh per annum (Rs 62,500 per month) with a monthly basic of Rs 40,000, his EPF deduction at the rate of 12% will be Rs 57,600.Now, if X buys an insurance policy with an annual premium of Rs 17,400 -- taking his total savings and investments to Rs 75,000 per annum -- his tax liability after standard deduction of Rs 50,000 in the old system will be the same as that under the new regime. Further, if X claims tax benefits against school fees, mediclaim or a housing loan, he will be better off in the old system due to the deductions allowed.Union Budget 2020: Full text of Nirmala Sitharaman's speechThe finance minister, in her speech, said a person earning Rs 15 lakh in a year and not availing of any deduction would pay only Rs 1,95,000 under the new regime compared with Rs 2,73,000 in the old system. Thus, his tax burden will be reduced by 78,000 under the new regime.Sitharaman argued that the person would still be the gainer under the new regime even if he was taking a deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh under various sections of Chapter-VI-A of the Income-Tax Act in the old system. But if a taxpayer buys a house taking a home loan, or invests in pension funds and mediclaim, his tax liability will be lower in the old system. If he could avail of a deduction of more than Rs 2,50,000, the old system will be beneficial for him.If a taxpayer in the highest tax bracket invests more than Rs 2.5 lakh in the allowed instruments under sections 24 (home loan), 80C (PF, insurance policy) and 80D (mediclaim), he will be better off sticking to the old system.Finance ministry has released calculations that show taxpayers could gain between 10,400 to 78,000 (annual taxable income 5 lakh to 15 lakh) a year if they move to the new no-exemption, no-deduction tax regime. Tax experts say the projected gains are exaggerated because they assume taxable income to remain the same once a taxpayer moves from the old system to the new. That can’t be. Under the new regime, taxable income will go up without any change in total income because all deductions and exemptions will become taxable.

The move to abolish dividend distribution tax , which was payable by India Inc , and taxing dividends in the hands of all shareholders, won’t hurt those who enjoy tax-free income up to Rs 5 lakh. However, it will pinch the pocket of rich shareholders. Dividends paid on and after April 1, 2020, will be taxed in the hands of shareholders at their applicable rate.

At present, shareholders earning dividend income of Rs 10 lakh or more have to bear a tax of 10% on such income, plus the applicable surcharge and cess. The dividend, no matter the quantum, is tax-free in the hands of foreign shareholders (but they don’t get a tax credit in their home country on the underlying tax).

Under the Budget proposals, a rich shareholder will find that against a tax rate of 10% on dividend income, the dividend gets added to his taxable income and is taxed at the applicable slab rate.

A person with a taxable income of between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore is subject to a tax rate of 34.32%.

Let us assume that X earned a taxable income of Rs 75 lakh, of which Rs 15 lakh is dividend income. Under the current provisions, a dividend of only Rs 5 lakh is taxed at a concessional rate of 10% plus applicable surcharge and cess.

Under the Budget proposals, they will end up paying a higher tax as the entire dividend income will be added to the total taxable income and be subject to the regular applicable tax rate. Thus, they will bear a higher tax burden of Rs 4.58 lakh on account of dividend income.

Currently, mutual funds are liable to pay DDT on equity and debt funds, but now investors have to pay tax on the dividend as per their income slabs. The same is true for those who choose the dividend reinvestment option.

38,['2/02/2020'],Many to miss out on ESOP relief,"This story is from February 2, 2020

BENGALURU: Two major initiatives for startups in the Union Budget 2020 — relaxation in tax on employee stock options (ESOPs) and tax holiday on profits for startups — have both come under fire. The fine print of the Budget reveals they are only applicable to companies that qualify under Section 80-IAC, which may limit the benefit to only a few hundred startups formed after 2016. ESOPs and tax holiday exemptions only apply to about 200 startups recognised by inter-ministerial board.

“In order to give a boost to the startup ecosystem, I propose to ease the burden of taxation on employees by deferring the tax payment by five years or till they leave the company or when they sell their shares, whichever is earliest,” finance minister Niramala Sitharaman said while presenting the Budget.

ESOPs are currently taxed when they become eligible for allotment, which puts a financial burden on employees as they may not be able to sell them at the same time. Employees are also taxed twice, at the time of exercising and at the time of selling (capital gains tax). Startup lobby groups like IndiaTech, IVCA and LocalCircles had requested the government to simplify this by taxing ESOPs just at the time of liquidity or sale.

Sitharaman also eased norms for the three-year tax holiday on profits for startups, taking the turnover limit to Rs 100 crore from Rs 25 crore and the period during which it can be exercised to 10 years from 7 years. But Budget’s fine print states only 80-IAC startups can benefit from these measures. Over 27,000 startups are registered with the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT).

The condition that employees pay taxes when they leave a company and a time limit of five years also restricts the benefit of the move. “If startups want to attract talent, it’s tougher to get it from larger startups (as employees have to pay tax on existing ESOPs if they leave). So in a way, negative impact for younger/smaller startups,” said Vivekananda Hallekare, founder of scooter-sharing startup Bounce. His startup, valued at $500 million recently, does not qualify as it was registered in 2014.

Optional trim

Startups had also asked for parity of long-term capital gains (LTCG) for unlisted shares, given that most companies are private, held by local funds with listed shares. While LTCG on listed shares stands at 10%, on unlisted it is at 20%.

The FM also announced several other new measures for startups, as she said the “Indian spirit of entrepreneurship which weathered several storms over the centuries inspire and motivate us. We recognise the need to support and further energise this spirit.”

These include plans to create digital platforms both for making registration of intellectual property rights (IPR) easy and also an investment clearance cell, which will provide information, support and permissions needed by the business at both the state and central levels. The government also plans to set up a seed fund to back idea-stage companies.

The stagnant property market has little to cheer, except extension of tax sops for affordable homes.

The additional deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh for interest paid on loans taken for purchase of affordable homes has now been extended till March 31, 2021.

Currently, while taxing income from capital gains, business profits and other sources in respect of transactions in real estate, if the consideration value is less than the circle rate by more than 5%, the difference is counted as income, both in the hands of the purchaser and seller. This limit is proposed to be increased to 10%.

The tax holiday on profits earned by builders constructing affordable homes is also proposed to be extended by a year.

Satish Magar, president, CREDAI National, expressed his disappointment. “Budget 2020 has not been encouraging for the real estate sector, which needs immediate attention. Unfortunately, none of the issues like a one-time restructuring of loans and enhancement of tax deductions on home loan have been addressed, except the extension of a tax holiday for affordable housing developers and loan sanctioning.”

Niranjan Hiranandani, MD of Hiranandani Group, said: “Affordable housing remains the government’s favourite with previous tax exemptions for both homebuyers and developers being continued for one more year. Commercial real estate segments may also witness a boost, with the focus on warehousing, data centres, schools, hospitals and hospitality.’’

40,['2/02/2020'],Sending over 7 lakh abroad to face tax trauma,"This story is from February 2, 2020

In a move that will block a big chunk of funds for those spending abroad, the government has announced a 5% tax collection at source (TCS) for remittances over Rs 7 lakh under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme.

The finance bill states that banks who receive Rs 7 lakh from an individual for remittance out of India under the LRS or from a seller of a tour package shall debit a sum equal to five percent of the remitted amount as income tax. In the 2016 budget, the government had put a similar 1% TCS for purchase of expensive cars. This TCS credit could be adjusted against the buyer’s income tax liability.

Indians have been sending on an average $1.5bn (Rs 10,700 crore) abroad every month under various heads including education, travel, purchase of immovable property, investment in equity/debt, gift/donations, maintenance of close relatives, and medical treatment. The LRS allows every individual to send up to $250000 abroad annually. The 5% TCS will enable the government collect $75 million in advance every month.

“So far there was no deduction of tax at source on remittances under the LRS. Now banks are required to collect tax at source on all remittances under LRS. If the remittance is to the senders own account, then they can claim credit for the tax. However, if it is paid to an overseas tour operator or an gift to a non-resident, the remitter will not get tax credit as the recipient would not be filing returns in India if they do not have any presence in India,” said Riaz Thingna Director, Grant Thornton Advisory

“Until now, tax collection at source provisions, which act as an additional tax on a transaction, are applied by the seller and recovered from the buyer in transactions such as purchase of alcohol, forest produce etc. These provisions are now widened to apply to LRS and the main reason is to create a tax trail for such remittances,” said Gaurav Mehndiratta , Partner - Corporate and International Tax , KPMG in India. He added that this would translate into additional compliance burden for the bankers and also result in working capital issues for the remitter till the time it is able to claim a credit of the same”

Unlike TDS which is deducted by the buyer, TCS is collected by a seller of specified goods from the buyer and the TCS is added to the sale amount and transferred to the government account.

It would also help boost employment, an imperative in poor job environment.“Measures have been taken for providing a level-playing field to our domestic manufacturers, particularly the MSME sector … The provisions for checking dumping of goods and imports of subsidized goods are also being strengthened for ensuring a level-playing field for domestic industry,” the FM said in her Budget speech.In the near term this means the price of imported daily-use items such as shelled walnuts, peanut butter , shavers, hair dryers, table and kitchenware, footwear, kids toys and even electric cars and two-wheelers will rise as the customs duty on these and many more have been increased (see table) quite substantially. The hikes could range from a few hundred rupees in case of certain items to well over thousands for items like an electric cars and bigger green buses.“Labour intensive sectors in MSME are critical for employment generation. Cheap and low-quality imports are an impediment to their growth,” the FM said.The localisation drive was also strengthened on the high-volume mobile phones category where components such as printed circuit boards, fingerprint scanners, display panels, and ringers also saw the import duty go up.

Mutual fund managers want to see implementation of the Budget proposals for the economy to be back on growth track while they feel that the FM’s proposal to do away with exemptions in favour of lower income tax rates may hamper household savings.

Nilesh Shah, MD & CEO, Kotak Mahindra MF said that the budget was good on intent. “However, the key is efficient execution in a time-bound manner. There are many positives to simplify things and encourage entrepreneurs but again, key will be execution in a time-bound manner. Intent needs to be converted into implementation,” Shah said.

Fund houses are guarded on their reaction to FM’s proposal on cut in number of tax exemptions. At present investments of up to Rs 1.5 lakh per year in ELSS by fund houses qualify for tax exemptions under section 80cc under the tax laws. “The personal tax reductions was well intentioned but the flip side is that removal of exemptions could have negative implications for savings” said Navneet Munot , ED & CIO, SBI MF.

TimesView Hopefully, these are teething problems and will be sorted out by the first weekday. Neither the traffic department nor the transport department is responsible for this but both will have to work together to mitigate commuters’ problems.

KOLKATA: On the first day of the Tallah Bridge shutdown vast parts of north Kolkata were choked with traffic snarls. As earth-moving machines were put to work on the Shyambazar-bound flank of Tallah Bridge, the cars in the area barely managed to inch forward — with the snarls stretching almost a kilometre at times. The travel time doubled or tripled even for short distances.The bitter experience on Saturday morning has sent cops to the drawing board — from Monday, truck movement on BT Road-Khagen Chatterjee Road-Cossipore Road-Dum Dum Road will be stopped throughout the day. The biggest challenge, said cops, was to educate motorists on the alternative routes.Around 11am, it took 40 minutes for a TOI team to travel from Sinthi crossing to Chiria More on a bus. Similarly, the journey from Neelgunj Depot to RG Kar Hospital through Raja Manindra Road and Belgachhia Road took another 35 minutes. During non-peak hours, around 12.30pm, the tail of the snarl at Lock Gate Flyover reached Fariapukur-Madanmohantala and the tail of the jam at Belgachhia bridge went up to Milk Colony bus stand at 2pm. Traffic movement remained slow around Ultadanga, Hatibagan, Shyambazar, Khanna crossing and pockets of Dum Dum and Lake Town.“It usually takes me around 10 minutes to take my daughter to Bagbazar Multipurpose School on my two-wheeler. On Saturday, it took me 40 minutes,” said Ravik Banerjee, a banker. “It took me two-and-a-half hours to complete a bus trip from Nowapara to Dharmatala,” said Arup Chowdhury, owner of a bus on route 34C.Auto drivers made the most of the situation. They offered shuttle services between Chiria More and Bagbazar via Cossipore Road and between Chiria More and Shyambazar via RG Kar. Passengers were asked to shell out anything between Rs 30-Rs 50 with the journey time ranging between 70 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening.On the closed bridge, local kids played football and cricket while a few pedestrians walked over the structure. Cops said they will stop pedestrian movement on the bridge after midnight when specialized machines will be operated.Over 100 cops were deployed to manage Saturday’s traffic. They said too many vehicles at both Chiria More and Belgachhia Road led to the gridlock. In a bid to avoid snarls on Raja Manindra Road, many buses took Indra Biswas Road with cars, choking both avenues. “This is going to be a major challenge in the coming days,” said a cop.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73866173,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-214008,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tallah-closure-day-1-traffic-chokes-n-kol-roads-kids-take-over-bridge/articleshow/73852885.cms

Jairajsinh Chauhan, 10, a resident of Narayan nagar in Bharuch town went on a bicycle ride with his friend Jian Jadhav, after returning home from school. While Jairajsinh was riding the bicycle, Jian was riding pillion when the speeding tanker hit the duo near the traffic intersection at Sambhu Dairy in Bharuch town.

Police sources said that the children were immediately rushed to the New Civil Hospital where Jairajsinh was declared dead on admission. Jian is still fighting for his life.

Bharuch town police have registered a case of accident and arrested the driver, Gopal Narayan Solanki.

Talking to TOI, chief officer of Bharuch Nagarpalika, Sanjay Soni said, “The area where the accident took place remains congested throughout the day. Thus, there is no question of over-speeding by the vehicle. We gathered information from the accident spot and found out that the boys lost balance and fell down from their bicycle and got injured in the rear wheels of the tanker.”

Soni added, “Once the police investigation is over, we will order inquiry into the entire incident. Our deep sympathy is with the bereaved family. We will also urge the state R&B department to construct a speed breaker near the intersection to avert such accidents as the road where the accident took place falls under the department.”

Panaji: The Union budget is directionless and a total disappointment for Goa, which is facing distress due to the closure of mining, Congress said on Saturday.

State Congress president Girish Chodankar said that the Budget was “all talk” with “no plan for concrete action” that could revive the country’s sluggish economy.

“This lacklustre budget gives full confidence that the government has given up its efforts to revive the economy. Budget is anti-common man, considering reduced food subsidy and fertiliser subsidy and slashing budget on mid-day meals and MGNREGA scheme,” he said.

The Congress described the Budget as “utterly directionless and depressing” as it failed to address the woes of the mining and tourism dependant families.

“The mining industry continues to be in total distress and there is no indication of any package for mining dependants, nor to the state. Our declining tourism sector continues to be directionless in the absence of any meaningful support from the Budget,” party spokesperson Tulio De Souza said.

Congress said that the Centre also failed to provide impetus for the housing industry, employment, and honest taxpayers. “Honest tax payers have lost all hopes of either higher deductions and lowering of tax burden. The Budget has punished them,” Chodankar said.

“Goa’s BJP CM has also failed to get any new projects sanctioned for Goa,” Chodankar said.

Surat: Police investigation the incident of rioting and stone pelting on cops in Limbayat area has revealed that the attack on cops was planned by the accused well in advance.

The rioters were carrying stones with them, in their pockets and hand, with an aim to help spread violence. The accused started pelting stones when the police tried to stop the protestors from entering the area where shops were open on Wednesday during Bharat Bandh call was given in protest of CAA and NRC.

Initially police booked the accused for rioting but detailed investigation revealed that it was a pre-planned conspiracy. Police have so far arrested 18 people, including the key conspirator Ansar Ehmad Ramjan Ali Qureshi, 25, a labourer. A native of Khagrelu in Fatehpur district of Uttar Pradesh, Qureshi works in a metal fabrication unit.

“It was Ansar who called everyone to gather in a lane near Madina Mosque and provoked the protesters to carry out a march to the neighbouring areas dominated by other communities and where shops were open as usual. They wanted to force these shops to down shutters,” said a police officer supervising the investigation.

Before the group could make a move, a police patrolling team reached the spot and dispersed the crowd. “After a while Ansar provoked the group again to move forward. Police tried to stop them but they continued shouting slogans and pushed the cops. Taking advantage of the situation some persons also pelted stones on the cops,” the officer informed.

So far police found that Ansar called the accused personally to spot. Police are also checking mobile phones of the accused to find out if they shared any provocative messages to encourage youth to join in the protest. “There were no stones lying in the street where the crowd was stopped by police. They must be carrying stones in pocket or hand,” police informed.

An assistant sub inspector suffered injury on the head in the incident while police booked a group of around 200 for rioting.

It should be noted that for the past three decades Limbayat has remained a communally sensitive area and police station was attacked in the past too. Even the murder of Kamlesh Tiwari, leader of Hindu Samaj Party, in Lucknow in October 2019 was planned in Limbayat.

Surat: Cooperative banks in south Gujarat play a crucial role in the rural economy of the region as they provide finance at low rate to small businessmen. Thus, the proposal of Union Budget 2020-21 to reduce tax on cooperative societies to 22 per cent from 30 per cent will help banks in cooperative sector a great deal.

Surat District Cooperative Bank (SDCB) with annual business of about Rs8,300 crore earns a profit of approximately Rs85 crore. In 2019-20 it paid tax at the rate of 30 per cent which amounts to Rs21 crore. In the new financial year, with the same profit it needs to pay only Rs20 crore as tax.

SDCB director Dilip Bhakta said, “Yes, there will be some benefit because of tax reduction, but it remains to be seen how much? Exempting cooperative societies from alternative minimum tax (AMT) is a good step, but the amount of benefit is not enough. Will these help create a level playing field for cooperative banks vis-à-vis the private sector financial institutions? It is highly doubtful.”

SDCB chairman Naresh Patel said, “We welcome reduction in tax, but increase in depositor insured amount from Rs1 lakh to Rs5 lakh will make us pay higher premium to Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation. This will eat away whatever we will save from reduction in tax.”

If a bank saves Rs2 crore tax but has to pay Rs2.5 crore in premium for depositors assured money, it is like giving from one hand and taking away from another, a cooperative bank officer said.

SV Chaudhary, managing director of SUMUL Dairy, said, “Things are not clear but will be once notification comes. At present, full rebate is given to business of a cooperative society with another. Full tax rebate was given under AMT. For such transactions, there is no benefit now. Why should cooperatives opt for 22 per cent tax regime when they don’t pay anything under 30 per cent structure with all deductions and rebates?”

Chhapra Sadar SDPO Ajay Kumar said a man travelling in the convoy received minor injuries in his hands. The police team, which was assigned to escort Kanhaiya, intervened and chased the attackers, who were shouting pro-CAA slogans. The SDPO said Kanhaiya escaped unhurt in the incident. A complaint was lodged in connection with the incident, he added.

Earlier, Ajay Singh, husband of JD(U) MP from Siwan, Kavita Singh, was detained at Dahiawa Tola as a precautionary measure. Singh, who had unsuccessfully contested assembly byelection from Daraundha in Siwan district last year, is considered to be a potential threat for Kanhaiya on his political turf.

Later, Kanhaiya addressed the public gathering at Hawai Adda Maidan in Chhapra where he assailed the Narendra Modi government for making certain amendments to the citizenship Act. Kanhaiya also urged Bihar CM Nitish Kumar to pass a resolution in the state assembly against the CAA and NRC to uphold the secular outlook and fabric of the county.

Earlier, Kanhaiya was greeted with ‘Go back, Kanhaiya’ slogans in Gopalganj where he had gone to address a public meeting as part of his ‘Save the Constitution Yatra’ launched from Champaran. On Friday, he was in Siwan from where he had left for Chhapra. On Saturday, he later went to Muzaffarpur to address another meeting against CAA-NRC.

VADODARA: An 11-year-old boy was detained on Saturday for stealing a revolver and cartridges from a businessman’s parked car on Vasna Road. Two more men have been declared wanted in this connection.

The prevention of crime branch (PCB) detained the boy near Gotri water tank looking at his suspicious behaviour. On checking his handbag, sleuths were surprised to find Rs 10,220 in cash, two mobile phones, three wrist watches and gold and silver ornaments. “We had a rough sketch of a boy made from the CCTV camera footage after the revolver was stolen. Since the boy’s behaviour seemed very suspicious and his face too matched the sketch, we checked his bag and brought him to the police station,” said inspector M V Bhagora of PCB.

The boy later admitted of being involved in breaking the window of the parked car and stealing the weapon along with the cartridges from the car. The boy said he used a catapult to break the widow glass and unlock the car. He told cops that two others – Pawan Jawad and Ajay Naade – planned such thefts and used to take him along.

“To avoid suspicion the duo used the boy as a cover for their nefarious activities. The boy would take out valuables from the cars and pass it on to Jawad and Naade and the trio would leave the area in separate autorickshaws,” said Bhagora. He added that after reaching the target site, the trio would not talk to each other verbally, but signal through eye contact.

Although the minor boy has been detained, the search for the two kingpin is on as the stolen revolver has not yet been recovered. Besides breaking the car’s window on Vasna Road, the trio had also attempted theft from another car near Golden Chowkdi. Police said that the minor boy was detained earlier in Ahmedabad twice for similar offences.

The revolver and cartridges belonged to a businessman identified as Ajitsinh Solanki and was stolen from the parking lot of Pancham Icon Complex last weekend.

Surat: A roadside eatery owner , who was stabbed by four persons on the night of January 26, died during treatment in a hospital in the early hours of Saturday. The attackers had refused to pay money for the food they consumed at the eatery following which a fight started between them.

Bhargav Chaudhary, 32, a resident of Khodiyar Nagar, was stabbed with a sharp-edged weapon by one of them. This led to heavy bleeding and an internal injury to him, police informed.

Friends and family members of Chaudhary on Saturday held a protest on road outside his house alleging that police didn’t book the accused on attempt to murder charge initially. They had registered the offence under IPC sections 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506(2) (criminal intimidation) among others.

“Police had already submitted a report in court after registering the offence. The accused were booked for attempt to murder. We arrested three accused on the day of crime and one on Saturday,” said a police officer at Limbayat police station.

Kendrapada: A 40-year-old RTI activist was found dead in Kendrapada early on Saturday. Police suspect that Ranjan Kumar Das, convener of the district unit of Odisha Suchana Adhikar Abhijan, was killed by some miscreants on Friday night. His body was found on a road in Berua village under Marsaghai police station in the district. It bore several injury marks.

“A case has been registered under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code. We have formed a special team to investigate the case. We had also pressed a sniffer dog into service during investigation,” Rajiv Lochan Panda, the subdivisional police officer (SDPO), Kendrapada, said.

Many social workers and RTI activists too suspect that he might have been killed as he had raised his voice against illegal sand quarrying, brick kiln owners and some allegedly venal NGOs and officials in the district and its nearby areas.

An RTI inquiry filed by him two years ago had exposed the illegal construction of a tourist resort by government-run Odisha Tourism Development Corporation (OTDC) in Kendrapada’s Bhitarkanika National Park. Das had brought to the fore the brazen violation of law by OTDC in building a tourist resort in the park’s core area where no such construction is allowed.

“Last year, Das had blown the lid off the embezzlement of about Rs 25 lakh of the integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) funds by an NGO in the district in a clear nexus with the forest officials of the Bhitarkanika National Park by not planting mangrove trees in the forest,” Amarabara Biswal of Kendrapada, said.

Police have seized Das’s body and sent it to the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack for autopsy.

Pradeep Pradan, the state convener of Odisha Suchana Adhikar Abhijan; Chitta Ranjan Behera an RTI activist and adviser to the Odisha Suchana Adhikar Abhijan; senior advocate Sudhir Mohanty and other RTI activists rushed to Kendrapada to offer their condolences to the Das’s parents, his wife and other relatives at Talasanga village.

“On December 10 last year, RTI activist Abhimanyu Panda (54), who was spearheading an anti-liquor movement was shot dead in broad daylight at Baliguda in Kandhamal district. In 2015, two RTI activists Krupasinghu Sahoo and another one from Niali block in Cuttack district were also killed. In 2014, RTI activist Ganesh Panda was killed,” Pradeep Pradhan the state convener of Odisha Suchana Adhikar Abhijan, said.

Bhopal: The state Congress slammed the Union Budget claiming that it is disappointing and will fail to solve the unemployment problem. Finance minister Tarun Bhanot said, “The budget is very disappointing and the announcements made by Nirmala Sitaraman will make the unemployment situation more critical. Modi government has reduced state’s share of central taxes and more than Rs 14,000 crore has been reduced. The Centre’s improper imposition of GST is causing distress to the states”.

Law minister PC Sharma said that the Union government is just copying the schemes of the Kamal Nath government. “Despite their tall claims inflation and poverty has not decreased. Till the time prices of petrol and diesel do not reduce, I will never accept that inflation is under control”, he said. Revenue minister Govind Singh Rajput said that the budget has failed to address the problems of poverty and inflation. “Smart City work is terribly slow. Farmers are our food growers and so far, the Centre has only indulged in politics over the agrarian community. Many schemes have been announced for farmers but they haven’t yeilded any result. Manmohan Singh government gave Rs 7,000 crore to Madhya Pradesh as Bundelkhand development package which was misappropriated. The Modi government only diverts attention from real issues. They promised 2 crore job creation per year but in the past six years no employment has been generated”, he said.

Slamming the budget, higher education minister Jeetu Patwari said, “Inflation and unemployment are increasing. Prices of petrol and cooking gas have increased and food prices have gone up. So how has inflation come down? In the name of budget, the Modi government is cheating the people. The government is more engaged in dividing the nation and selling the country’s assets to private players”. State Congress media cell chairperson Shobha Oza said, “It is an extremely disappointing budget . The longest budget speech had no announcements regarding how to arrest the sinking economy, farmer distress and increasing unemployment. The budget should have explained how and why Air India, Indian Railways, LIC, Bharat Petroleum and IDBI have come to a stage when they have to be sold.” State Congress spokesman Durgesh Sharma said, “People of this country were expecting that the annual budget will try to address the falling economy. But it is still the old Modi story – sell LIC, sell IDBI, decrease subsidies on fertilisers for farmers and no control over shooting prices of fuel. Such a long budget speech. It is true that empty vessels make the most noise. Today’s budget proved the idiom right”.

PATNA: A group of villagers torched a shop selling construction materials and set four vehicles parked in front of it on fire at Neori village under the Bihta police station area in western Patna on Saturday. The villagers alleged that one Mahesh Yadav was running the shop from government land.

According to locals, Mahesh had opened the shop at the disputed site after entering into an agreement with an ex-serviceman, who had identified himself as the owner of the land. The villagers had asked Mahesh several times to vacate the land, but to no avail.

Senior police officers rushed to the spot after the incident to bring situation under control. Neora police outpost incharge Santosh Kumar said a tractor, an SUV, an autorickshaw and a bike were torched by the villagers.

“At least five people have been detained in connection with the violence,” Kumar said, adding raids were on to arrest those involved in the incident.

Bihta circle officer S K Verma said Mahesh had submitted documents to prove his claim that the then ADM (law and order) had made settlement of the land in favour the ex-serviceman in 1966. “He had attempted to fill up a portion of land after which an encroachment case was registered against him,” he said.

Verma said he had written to deputy collector (land reforms) recently to raise the issue with the present ADM (law and order). “We will now write to the local police to enforce prohibitory orders on the disputed plot,” he added.

The contractor has already been paid Rs 8.3 crore by the government to set up the plant, the high court noted

PANAJI: Observing that the contractor, M K Aromatics Ltd, has not been able to set up a plastic waste-to-fuel plant at Pernem within the stipulated timeframe, the high court of Bombay at Goa directed the state to encash the contractor’s Rs 1 crore bank guarantee. It also directed the contractor to get the plant operational by May 15.

The high court also directed the contractor to deposit a fresh bank guarantee of Rs 2 crore within 15 days.

M K Aromatics will deposit Rs 2 crore as guarantee in a nationalised bank within 15 days in favour of Goa State Urban Development Agency (GSUDA), the agency overseeing the implementation of the project, its counsel A D Bhobe told the court.

“This statement is accepted as an undertaking to this court,” the division bench of justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar observed, adding, “if the guarantee is not furnished within 15 days, we will be left with no option but to consider taking action for the breach of undertaking solemnly given to this court.”

The court noted that “if the plant is not made operational by May 15, GSUDA will have absolute unqualified and irrevocable rights to invoke the bank guarantee without any necessity of issuing notice to the contractor.”

The court directed the state government and GSUDA to mention this matter in case of any difficulties in encashing the bank guarantee.

The contract for setting up the said plant was awarded to M K Aromatics Ltd, on November 11, 2014 and the work was to be completed on August 10, 2015.

The bench noted that the government extended a loan of over Rs 6.3 crore to the contractor, when it was in need of such a plant. “The loan was made repayable in instalment only upon the plant being made operational, which we regard as quite easy terms,” the court observed.

“Further Rs 2 crore was paid to this contractor. This means the contractor, as of date, has received an amount of Rs 8.3 crore,” court noted.

In terms of the original work order, the plant was to be made operational on August 10, 2015. However, the contractor stated that the Pernem Municipal Council and the locals at the site didn’t allow the works to proceed at the desired pace.

An MoU was signed between the government and the Pernem Municipal Council to resolve the issues. Based on the same, there was a revision in the schedule and the contractor had to complete the works by March 31, 2017. Even this was not complied with by the contractor, the court observed.

Another student who completed her postgraduation in 2016, Apeksha, said “I was told to get a no-due certificate from the department library, central library and hostel (although I was not a hosteller). As per norms, I had to submit a DD of Rs 100 to the principal’s office. After the payment, when I went to get the no-due certificate, I was forced to pay Rs 100 to the hostel warden and another Rs 100 to the library staff. Upon questioning, I was told that if I wanted to get my work done, I needed to pay.”

Speaking to TOI, K Kumar Raja, lifetime academic senate member of AU, said, “It must be ensured that degree certificates are properly sent with the required protection. Most of the universities and institutions usually use hard board or thermocol sheets sto support important documents so that they are not damaged while being posted.”

“If the certificates are crumpled and if they are presented for job interviews, they would reflect on the candidate’s attitude. This issue will be discussed in our next meeting,” said Kumar Raja, who is also the founder-member and joint secretary of Andhra University Alumni Association. On contacting V Krishna Mohan, the registrar, he said, “Usually, the certificates are packed properly and are despatched by registered post. However, we regret the inconvenience caused. The students will be contacted by our controller.”

Panaji: As Bondvoll lake is in the final stages of becoming first officially notified wetland in Goa, the Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB) on Saturday appointed the first three ‘wetland mitra’ under a central programme to look after the protection and management of lake.

Under the programme, citizens are appointed to work as wetland mitra on a voluntary basis. GSBB member secretary Pradip Sarmokadam said that work has already begun to get 35 other areas notified as wetland.

Naresh D’Souza, Elsa Fernandes and Lucio Rego from Santa Cruz will now work as ‘wetland mitra’ for preservation and management of Bondvoll lake for an initial period of two years. They were officially handed over their badges on Saturday.

“The National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) is carrying out the work of identifying wetlands in the state. But we have already identified as many as 35 wetlands on the ground. But there is a lengthy process to be completed for their notification. A document has to be created on the wetland and its biodiversity, but is requires detailed data,” Sarmokadam said during an event organised by GSBB and Goa state wetland authority to observe World Wetland Day.

He said that GSBB is also going about the process of notification very carefully keeping in mind the fears of locals.

Pramod Salaskar made a presentation to members of the biodiversity management committees (BMC) in the state on how he helped save the Powai lake from deterioration. BMCs help create people’s biodiversity register (PBR), which is a detailed record of the biodiversity in each village.

NIO’s acting director Sanil Kumar said that they have expedited the work to identify wetlands in Goa for the GSBB.

Agra: UP tourism department issued an alert to travel fraternity in Agra and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Agra circle, to immediately inform the health department about visits of any Chinese tourists anywhere in the city. The move comes days after the first positive coronavirus case was reported in Kerala.

According to the alert advisory, as per information provided by Mukesh Kumar Vats, the chief medical officer (CMO), Agra, “one or two Chinese nationals were likely to visit Agra from Patna on Saturday”. However, no one could be traced till evening, said officials.

The CMO told TOI on Saturday that his department had received information about the arrival of two Chinese nationals from their office in Lucknow on Friday and he had immediately alerted people in the tourism sector. He, however, said they have not been traced so far.

He added two Chinese nationals, who had visited Agra last month, were found medically fit after being thoroughly screened by doctors. He also said that there is no need to panic as doctors and health officials are all on alert.

Superintending archaeologist (Agra circle) Vasant Swarankar, said, “I have directed my team to check identity of foreign tourists. If they spot any Chinese national they will immediately inform the district authorities along with the health department.” He added that Agra needs to be on alert as it is a major tourist destination and lots of Chinese nationals visit the Taj and other monuments.

Vice-president of Tourist Guild Association, Rajiv Saxena, said that everyone should be on alert. He, however, said that many Chinese tour groups had already cancelled their trips to India for the month of February. “This dangerous virus would badly impact our tourism sector in Agra,” he claimed.

Nashik: After laying the piped natural gas (PNG) pipeline on the 1.1-km stretch of the maiden smart road between Ashok Stambh and Trimbak Naka, the Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited ( MNGL ) has now decided to lay similar supply pipelines in Pahchavati and Sharanpur areas of the city where roads are to be developed under the smart city.

Around 36-km of road is to be developed under the smart city and the project is being carried out by the NMSCDCL. A civic official said they will give layouts of the roads to be developed under the smart city to the MNGL so that the latter can plan the laying of pipelines.

“We had meeting with MNGL officials over cooking gas lines in the city. We are constructing roads under the smart city and it has been decided that the MNGL will lay the pipeline simultaneously when the road is being developed under the smart city,” Uddhav Nimse, civic standing committee chairman, said.

Smart city area development has been planned in core areas of the city like Panchavati and Sharanpur. The 36-km length comprises 23-km major and 13-km minor roads.

The MNGL has laid underground pipes for supplying compressed natural gas to fuel stations and piped natural gas to the households and industrial units. In the next eight years, it has to lay underground pipes with a length of over 500-km across the city for supplying both the green fuels.

Apart from piped natural gas, MNGL has also proposed six CNG stations to provide green fuel to city buses and other vehicles. These six CNG stations are expected to be operational by March-end this year.

PANAJI: The forest department plans to harvest rainwater to create small and medium sized man-made water bodies in forest areas across the state.

Principal chief conservator of forests Subhash Chandra on Saturday said this initiative will help the state contribute to the Central government’s water conservation campaign, Jal Shakti Abhiyan. These water bodies will also ensure that wild animals do not wander into nearby villages in search of water, he said.

Speaking at the Goa state biodiversity board’s event on the occasion of World Wetland Day, Chandra said Goa’s hinterland has immense eco-tourism potential and that the forest department wants to aid the state government in promoting areas like wetlands, forests and green landscapes in the hinterland as eco-tourism attractions.

Chandra said the recently organised bird festival, hosted by the forest department, was an example of how the department can help the state attract tourists to the hinterlands. “The local cuisine in the hinterlands is also part of the diversity, and this can become another USP,” Chandra said.

PANAJI: The BJP government headed by former chief minister Manohar Parrikar accepted Rs 100 crore from the casino industry in order to delay the appointment of the Goa gaming commissioner, Congress alleged on Saturday.

State party president Girish Chodankar said the recent appointment of the gaming commissioner was an attempt by chief minister Pramod Sawant to extract additional funds from off-shore and on-shore casinos .

“With rules not in place, the appointment of the gaming commissioner is just a means to extract more money from casino owners as the government knows that if you put a little pressure on the casinos, the operators will come running with bags,” Chodankar said.

“Soon someone will file a petition in the courts and get a stay on the ban on Goans , and this will give the state government an excuse not to frame the rules for the gaming commissioner,” he said.

Visakhapatnam: The ongoing protest at Andhra University took a political turn on Saturday when former minister and TDP MLC Nara Lokesh extended his support to the students on social media. In a Tweet, Lokesh found fault with the authorities concerned for increasing the fee. “A majority of the students of Andhra University belong to the rural parts and weaker sections. I demand the authorities to roll back the fee hike ,” demanded Lokesh on Twitter.

On the other hand, the students intensified their stir on Saturday – the fourth day of their protest. A huge police force was deployed on the campus to prevent untoward incidents.

Speaking to TOI, K Ashok, a PDSO leader said vice-chancellor Prof PVGD Prasad Reddy has reached out to the students in the evening and tried to explain the developmental initiatives taken up after he assumed the charge as the in-charge vice-chancellor in July, 2019. “But he did not promise to decrease the fee,” he said.

However, varsity officials suspect interference of political forces in the protest. “The fee structure was revised during the tenure of the former vice-chancellor in April 2019 and it is not a new decision. Leave aside the full allocation of block grants, the former state government had diverted a large amount of internal funds of the varsity to Pusupu-Kunkuma scheme before the elections. The varsity is currently facing a financial crisis due to all these factors,” said a university official.

73,['2/02/2020'],Not Enough Done To Jumpstart Slow Economy: Industry,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Panaji: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s Budget for 2020-21 may have won praise for initiatives that could benefit the country in the long-run, but has left many industry players rueing that more could have been done to revive the sluggish economy.

Captains of Goa’s corporate sector were eyeing some big announcements in the Budget which could jumpstart the nation’s economy. Many, however, were left disappointed.

“We were expecting decisions that would have brought money into the market and into hands of individuals who would have spent it, thus boosting the economy. Unfortunately, the proposals seem to be all long-term planning which might not result in immediate revival of the economy,” said Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Manoj Caculo.

Caculo did laud the Centre’s move to recognise the contribution made by large corporate houses to the Indian economy. “I have to admit that a lot of things the government has proposed will definitely help the economy and country, but all this will be work-in-progress, it will be in the long-run,” Caculo said.

Goa State Industries Association president Damodar Kochkar felt the government could have done more to relax the stress on enforcement. “In this budget we were expecting a bit of leeway in the enforcement part to give people confidence to invest. If you want the private sector to invest, you need some clarity about ease of doing business and your liability. This, however, has not been clarified,” Kochkar said.

Industry leaders welcomed the announcement that Rs 100 lakh crore will be invested on infrastructure over the next five years. But they stressed that this money needs to be spent in such a way that its benefits trickle-down to the economy, thus reviving the economic cycle.

“The government needs to spend money on infrastructure to get the wheels of the economy moving. Unless they do that, I don’t think they will come anywhere close to 10% nominal growth that Sitharaman announced,” said Verna Industries Association president Blaise Costabir.

“Focusing on Goa, infra spending on cold storage facilities, logistics and other areas would help the state’s fisheries sector. Encouraging farmer producer organisations for the fisheries sector is also a welcome step for the state,” said CII Goa State Council chairman Lalit Saraswat.

Kolhapur: District collector Daulat Desai ordered various departments to carry out a joint survey within 15 days to identify the parking spots and shift the government offices with an aim to streamline traffic and reduce congestion across the city.

A meeting was held with the activists and officials of various departments at the district collector’s office on Saturday.

The activists demanded that the government offices, especially a police station, in old Rajwada near Mahalaxmi temple be shifted. Desai said that it was necessary to have the police station near the temple for security purposes. Activist Ramesh More said that a small chowki could be developed with a few police staff to look after the security of the temple and the police station could be shifted to a ground, which they claimed was being used for illegal activities. Desai said that the permission from the district police was a must before shifting the police station.

Activist Ashok Powar said the offices in Paga building, which also houses a library, be relocated to the central administrative building at Kasba Bawda. Desai said that the offices could be shifted to other locations, but the library should remain there. “We can propose a modern study room for the students. Let Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) manage it,” he said.

Some officials said that the building was owned by a trust run by the royal family. The activists requested Desai to have word with a Shahu Chhatrapati Maharaj, who is the chief patron of the trust.

Activists further demanded that the traffic congestion along the busy Bhausingji road, which houses the offices of the tehsildar, land survey and land records, be reduced. Activists claimed that a few buildings along the roads were heritage structures, which were facing damage due to the smoke from the vehicles.

KMC’s chief city engineer Netradip Sarnobat said that they were considering introducing one-way traffic along the route, besides odd-even parking. Desai said that the KMC should take the help of the traffic police to undertake a trial of the one-way route and odd-even parking and ensure the visitors were asked to park their vehicles nearby Dasara Chowk.

Agra: Over 600 people, including three identified students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) were booked by Aligarh police late on Friday for allegedly violating prohibitory order and blocking a road near Shahjamal area, where women have been sitting on protest for the past few days.

Police said that a group of people led by AMU students’ union vice-president Sajjad Subhan Rather reached Eidgah in Shahjamal area and started shouting slogans against CAA and NRC. When the group was asked to end the protest, as they did not have any permission, they started shouting slogans loudly. Rather allegedly incited the protesting women to do so, police said.

While, police claimed that Rather wore a burqa and mixed with the crowd to evade arrest, the latter refuted the allegations. Rather said, “I went to the dharna site to help the protesting women, who were sitting in the open area and demanding quilts and tent.” He said that he also wrote a letter to the SP (crime) and SP (city) demanding the same.

Meanwhile, former AMUSU vice-president said that he was surprised to know about the FIR against him as he did not vitiate the peaceful protest at Shahjamal area in any manner.

The FIR, against Rather, two students from Law faculty and 600 unidentified people was registered under sections 147 (riots), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 283 (danger or obstruction in public way) and 341 (wrongful restraint) of IPC with the Delhi gate police station.

77,['2/02/2020'],More loans to trap us in debts: Farmers,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Agra: Farmers in Agra region were largely disappointed by the Union Budget, pointing out that by increasing agriculture lending target to Rs 15 lakh crore for 2020-21, the government wanted to perpetually keep them chained by debts. More loan will only worsen the financial situation, they said.

Many wondered how the government proposed to double their income or prevent stray animals from destroying their crops. Besides, Budget was quiet on hiking minimum support price.

Farmer leader Shyam Singh Chahar said, “Farmers were expecting at least a 50% increase in the Rs 6,000 annually handout under the PM-Kisan scheme.”

Farmer organizations found nothing new about the proposed Krishi Udaan by civil aviation ministry and Krishi Rail to transport agri-products to both within and outside the country. Bharatiya Kisan Union’s Somveer Yadav said, “These schemes are not going to benefit farmers. Traders who deal in agriculture products will reap benefits.”

Aamir Bhai, general secretary of Potato Producers Association, said the Budget did not even mention problems of farmers of the region. “There are just 270 cold storage facilities in the district with a capacity of over 25 lakh metric tonnes whereas potato is cultivated in around 72,000 hectares. Farmers are not even able to retain their investments.” He added that government was yet to fulfill the promise made by PM Modi before 2014 Lok Sabha elections to set up a potato processing unit in Agra.

The only thing, farmer organisations appreciated were the proposals on addressing problems of 100 water-stressed districts and offer on use of solar power.

CM Uddhav Thackeray

MUMBAI: Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Saturday Budget 2020 presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is removed from reality and has given a “step-motherly” treatment to Maharashtra and Mumbai. “It is deeply disappointing for Maharashtra. This Budget does injustice to Maharashtra and Mumbai, which are the country’s growth engine,” said Thackeray who was a BJP ally till a few months ago.

Thackeray said the Budget does not address key problems such as unemployment, and the allocation for Skill India is inadequate.

He said it does not support development of public amenities and ongoing infrastructure projects in Mumbai, such as the Metro.

“The Budget gives no momentum to the development of a railway network in the state, except for the mention of projects announced earlier, such as the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train.”

He said the scheme Sitharaman announced to develop heritage sites as “iconic sites” did not mention any from the culturally rich state. “The step-motherly treatment given to Maharashtra has become evident in the Budget. The International Financial Services Centre in Gujarat has been strengthened while Mumbai, which makes the highest contribution to the country’s growth, has been deliberately ignored,” he said.

The decision to divest stake in LIC and possible privatisation of the railways reveal the precarious state of the economy, he said. The GDP growth rate for the current financial year is 5% while the economic survey estimated 6-6.5% in 2020-21, he added. “This growth does not have the potential to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dream of making India a $5 trillion economy,” said Thackeray. He dismissed the claim GST gave relief to small and medium enterprises. “Small and medium enterprises have been troubled by GST. People’s purchasing power has shrunk, impacting small-scale industries. This has landed workers in trouble.”

Thiruvananthapuram: The state has set a few precedents with regard to internship for fresh engineering graduates in urban local bodies as announced in the Union Budget for 2020-21. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in the budget speech that the government proposes to start a programme whereby urban local bodies across the country would provide internship opportunities to fresh engineers for a period up to one year.

Thiruvananthapuram corporation and Thiruvananthapuram district administration had successfully implemented internship models in various projects. Former district collector K Vasuki had launched DCIP (district collectors internship project) during her tenure. “Engaging young graduates and students as interns in projects has yielded great results. There is so much of energy among the youth and internship is a great way to tap that energy. During the collection camps organised during floods in 2018, it was the interns who organised the volunteers and there was a high level of professionalism in that collection drive and in the way it was conducted. It happened mainly because of the active work of professionals who volunteered to be a part of that mission,” said K Vasuki who is now the director of department of agriculture.

Thiruvananthapuram corporation formed a collective under then mayor V K Prasanth which was titled as Green army comprising young graduates and students who spearheaded awareness on climate change, anti-plastic campaign and no burn movement.

The local self government department and department of education have teamed up to offer internship opportunities for BTech graduates. Engineering graduates and post-graduates can now do internship in local self government institutions (LSGI) as well as project management units and related institutions under LSGD at a monthly stipend starting from Rs 10,000. The project is being implemented as part of making use of engineering students’ skills in resolving technical issues related to LSGD and to create job opportunities.

Those who complete their courses in government, aided, self-financing engineering colleges can apply for internship in local bodies and in related institutions like KILA, Suchitwa mission, MGNREGA, Clean Kerala company, Amrut mission management unit etc. The internship will be for a period of one year. The graduates and post-graduates will get monthly stipend of Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 respectively.

AGRA: Traders of Sanjay Place went bare chested at the Dharna spot in the parking area on Saturday as a mark of protest against the Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) administration over the issue of parking fee. Traders who’ve been on an indefinite strike since past 19 days claimed that AMC is making it difficult for them to do business.

Leaders of the Congress and Samajwadi Party are participating in the strike on a daily basis. The dispute over parking fee between traders of Sanjay Place and Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) is sub judice. The traders want AMC to cancel the parking contracts till the court delivers its final orders in the matter.

Vice president of the Sanjay Place market association Brajendra Baghel said, “AMC has flouted norms as traders of the market have already paid a fee for parking space at the time of purchasing property. We have sought details under the RTI Act. It will reveal all the malpractices done by the AMC administration to exploit the traders and common people.

PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday said entry of tourists into casinos would not be restricted until rules and regulations for the functioning of the gaming commission are in place.

Sawant told reporters that the gaming commissioner has been appointed but it will take some time before the rules are notified. He said the ban on Goans has become effective from February 1.

A state government official said that right from designating staff to issuing the tourist permits and from specifying documentation to fees and fines, the rules will define everything.

“The gaming commissioner will have to designate people to issue tourists permits across the state,” he said.

“For this, the government has to first define what documents the gaming commissioner should insist on. Further, modalities for challans and penal liabilities, if any, have to be specified in the rules,” he added.

(done)

Nashik: It would be a win-win situation for farmers and exporters in the region if Nashik is brought under the ambit of the Krishi Udaan scheme.

Union finance minister Nirmala Sithraman on Saturday announced that the civil aviation ministry would launch the scheme for both national and international routes to help farmers transport their produce.

“The scheme would be a big boon for farmers from the entire region as well as for exporters,” said sources in the Nashik-based Halcon — a joint venture between Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) and Container Corporation of India (Concor).

Halcon CEO Sudhakar Sen welcomed the government’s move. “We will surely request the civil aviation ministry to bring Nashik under the scheme,” he said.

“We already have all infrastructure like packaging house, cold storage and customs clearance. Air cargo complex of Halcon is adjacent to the Ozar airport. Hence, there is huge potential for Kirishi Udan flights from here,” added Sen.

Halcon is involved in export of various agricultural and horticulture products from Nashik and other districts in the state.

It exports around 4,500 tonne of fresh vegetables and fruits annually to London, Dubai and other international markets from the Mumbai airport.

Vegetables like okra, drumstick, luffa, flat beans and chilli are being exported by air directly from Nashik airport to Dubai. However, fresh fruits like pomegranate, guava and chiku are exported through the Mumbai airport.

Halcon sources said the bulk of produce is sent from Nashik to Mumbai by road and then despatched either by air or by ships from Jawaharlal Nehru Port. If cargo flights start operating from Nashik airport under the scheme, it would be cost effective to exporters.

Road transport of about four tonne of produce costs the importers around Rs 10,000.

NASHIK: The ‘one-product, one-district’ scheme envisaged in the Union Budget on Saturday triggered a slugfest among farmers in Nashik district, which is a hub of onions and grapes .

While onion farmers are arguing that their produce should be brought under the scheme because of price volatility and losses, grape growers say they deserve it because of tough competition in the international market.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman made the announcement in the budget about the Centre’s support to states to boost marketing and exports of crops in the horticulture sector. “States have to resort to a cluster basis programme under one-product, one-district scheme,” she said.

Sources in the Union agriculture ministry told TOI that either onions or grapes grown in Nashik district is likely to be included in the scheme. “Nashik is known in the country as hub of onion and grape production. Hence, there will be a tussle between farmers on inclusion of their crop in the scheme,” said an official.

Onion farmer Nivrutti Nyaharkar said, “The production cost of onions increases due to fluctuation in the climate most of the time. The farmers don’t get profit even if the rates are high. Hence, the government needs to bring onions under the scheme.”

The onion farmers reminded that there are over 10 lakh of them are engaged in cultivation of the crop across Nashik district.

The onion crop cultivation is done in 10 of the 15 talukas in the district and the annual production is estimated at over 30 lakh tonne a year.

Grape plantation is spread over two lakh acres in Niphad, Dindori and Chandwad taluka of the district and its annual production is around 18 lakh tonne. There are around 1.5 lakh grape farmers in the district.

Manik Patil, senior member of Maharashtra Rajya Draksha Bagayatdar Sangh, “The district has monopoly in onion crop and that the government only needs to decide on the export policy. There is, however, no need for the government to intervene in marketing and production as Nashik’s onions have a huge market in India as well as abroad.”

“There is a need to take grapes under the one-produce one-district scheme. There is huge competition for grape exporters in the international market. The government should focus on marketing and production of grapes,” added Patil.

The Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway is about to take shape with Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announcing in the Budget that the work will start soon. The project, expected to cut short travelling time between the two metros and promote an infrastructure corridor along the alignment, will be a growth engine and will be taken up under the hybrid-annuity model (HAM).

The eight-lane access-controlled expressway will pass through Karnataka (77km), Andhra Pradesh (91km), and Tamil Nadu (94km). While land acquisition is nearing completion in the other two states, Tamil Nadu has appointed an authority to acquire 972.81 hectares in Vellore, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur. ""The NHAI regional office, Chennai takes care of the third phase of the programme covering 106km, including a stretch of 12km in Andhra Pradesh. Tenders will be floated in a few weeks for four packages. The state pollution control board is all set to conduct a public hearing as the environment impact assessment/ environment management plan report has been submitted,"" said a senior NHAI official.

The agency proposes to take up the project under the Bharatmala Pariyojana scheme to provide a corridor parallel to the existing NH-4 (Mumbai-Kolar-Bengaluru-Chennai), which is one of the most congested highways in the country. The new expressway will ease traffic, as per feasibility study report submitted by a consultant.

The environment appraisal committee of the Union ministry of environment and forests, in May 2018, approved the terms of reference for environmental clearance of the project, subject to the condition that cumulative impact assessment study and traffic density study be carried out. ""The NHAI has assessed that the estimated Passenger Car Units (a measure to assess traffic flow) could be 49,126 per day in the next fiscal, the year of award of tender. The growth rate could be 5.6% per annum and the projected traffic could be 1.46 lakh PCUs in 20 years,"" another official said. There is no case pending in the court as of now against the execution of the project.

Private land measuring 757.41 hectares has to be acquired for the project, and public notification has been issued in this regard. The Central agency has taken possession of 328.69 hectares so far. The NHAI is also preparing a detailed project report for constructing a six-lane elevated corridor from Sriperumbudur to Maduravoyal, for about 23.2km, as part of Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway.

Bhubaneswar: The Union Budget drew a mixed response from the state government, with chief minister Naveen Patnaik welcoming proposals to increase agriculture spending and FDI in education, but expressing concern over stagnant allocation under centrally sponsored schemes and shrinking of divisible pool. He said Odisha would lose around Rs 3,000 crore in the current fiscal as the divisible pool of central taxes has shrunk by almost Rs 59,000 crore.

“We welcome initiatives such as Krishi Rail and Krishi Udan for a seamless national cold supply chain. The PM-KUSUM to provide 20 lakh farmers with solar pump is also good,” he said, adding that he appreciated the announcement of a new education policy and FDI in the education sector.

The chief minister also lauded finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s proposal to abolish dividend distribution tax (DDT). He also gave a thumbs up to the introduction of concessional component tax.

“Odisha had requested extension of concessional tax rates to cooperatives in line with corporate tax cuts. We welcome the announcement of concessional tax rates for cooperatives and increase of deposit insurance coverage from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh,” said Naveen.

The BJD chief also sounded a warning note to the Centre, citing the slump witnessed by the Sensex on Saturday. He said this showed that there was huge scope for rectification as the Sensex was an indicator of investor confidence. “Investor confidence is important for attracting investment and spurring growth,” he added.

The Budget was welcomed by the industry bodies of the state. Chairperson of FICCI Odisha State Council, Monica Nayyar Patnaik, said, “The measures announced by the government will strengthen India, individuals and industry.” J B Pany, co-chairman, ICC Odisha State Council, said the decision to set up an investment clearance cell to facilitate investors investment advisory, land bank and facilitate clearances was to be appreciated.

NASHIK: The Nashik Tribal Department (NTD) has initiated a new campaign called ‘ Mission Udaan ’ for the upliftment of tribal students in all its 39 schools of government ashramshalas.

Under the campaign, the students of class VI to VIII will undergo a monthly test of 100 marks and help them prepare for competitive examinations after passing out from the schools.

Kumar Ashirvad, project officer, NTD, said “These students are very talented but they require exposure for the competitive examinations. With the help of the monthly tests, the students will be prepared for such competitive examinations after school.”

The NTD wishes to carry on the campaign for at least two years and the first test of the campaign was conducted on the last two days of the January month.

“We are positive that the test will yield good results. We will bring necessary changes to the pattern of the test as and when required. Our only aim is to let the students get some exposure and practice for the pattern of various competitive examinations,” Ashirvad told TOI.

The students get multiple choices for the test and have to attempt it on the OMR (optical mark recognition) sheet. This sheet is now used in all the competitive examinations to select the correct option. Also, many colleges require the students to fill up their details like roll numbers and subject codes on OMR sheets these days.

The questions asked in the test are from Mathematics, Science, Social Science, English and General Aptitude. Over 5,800 students with approximately 150 students per school will appear for the test.

The tribal department is also training its teachers to conduct the tests. The teachers should be able to train the students for the test during their school hours and conduct a three-hour test in the same time frame, added Ashirvad.

98,['2/02/2020'],It’s a war cry against Kerala: Thomas Isaac,"This story is from February 2, 2020

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: “The Union Budget is a war cry against Kerala. Never before in the history of Independent India did the state meet with such a raw deal. The budget comes as a huge disappointment to Kerala,” finance minister T M Thomas Isaac said here on Saturday.

Isaac said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proved to have learned no lessons from her previous budget. “The Union finance minister failed to feel the vibes of an economic recession around the corner when she presented her budget for 2019-20. Here she committed the same mistakes again and overlooked the economic slowdown staring at the country. The budgetary provision to Kerala has been whittled down from the existing 2.5% to 1.9%. This is something unexpected and unacceptable. While the allocation to the state was Rs 17,872 crore in the last budget, it has been reduced to Rs 15,236 crore this time,” Isaac said.

The Union Budget would have its impact on the state budget that Isaac is set to present in the assembly on February 7. “A shortage of around Rs 5,000 crore in the allocation, compared to our expectations is bound to have its impact. We will have to explore out of the box solutions to fund the programmes and schemes being readied as part of our next budget,” Isaac said.

He said the Union government was obsessed with the “monetarist economic outlook”, which prompts it to see the economic slowdown as a result of the problems in the supply end. “The government is not yet willing to come into terms with the plain fact that it's the deterioration of buying capacity of people that debilitate the economy. But, the Union government tries to save the economy by doling out more and more freebies to the corporates,” Isaac said. There was substantial decrease in the allocation to key sectors, but the Union finance minister tried to create a mirage by not recalling the allocation those sectors had received in the last budget, he said.

Meanwhile, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the budget proposal to impose 22 % tax and surcharge on primary cooperative societies would further weaken the cooperative sector at a time when the sector was in need of governmental support than ever before. “The attempts to eliminate cooperative sector would evoke strong repercussions. How big the impact of steep cut in tax share would be known only after some time. The budget once again proved to be anti-people and corporate friendly. Attempts to violate the spirit of federal principles are galore. The decision to go ahead with disinvestment and sell out LIC are unacceptable,” he said.

According to Vijayan, the demand of state for more funds for major projects like semi-high speed rail and Angamali-Sabari rail line was totally ignored in the budget.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: A 39-year-old woman, a resident of Naranpura and an assistant manager with a pharma company, lodged a complaint with the cyber cell on Friday, alleging that a man who identified himself as Dr Himesh Parikh from the UK and said he was working with the United Nations (UN) had cheated her of Rs 17,28,000 after promising to marry her.

According to the FIR, the woman had put her biodata and a photo on a matrimonial site. On July 2, 2019, she got a message from a man who identified himself as Dr Himesh Parikh from UK.

“He told her that he is from Rajkot and works at a UN military base in Kenya as a doctor. They kept chatting and talking on the phone till July 27, 2019, and Parikh then stopped messaging her,” said a cyber cell official.

The FIR states that on September 2019, he messaged her from another number and told her that their camp had moved to Saudi Arabia and had come under attack and he could thus not contact her. He then told her that he would marry her when comes to Ahmedabad.

“In November, he called her and said that those ‘killed in the attack’ had been compensated and others had not and they were thus protesting against the UN,” an investigator said. At the end of December, he told her that they had won and he had been compensated $24,000,000 and had named her as his beneficiary, as she was now his fiancée.

The accused then told her that he was sending her a parcel with a cashier’s cheque for $240,000 and a watch. On January 3, 2020, she got a call from a man called James Grey from one ‘Global Security Courier’ who told her that her parcel had reached Delhi and she would have pay Rs 98,000 to get it, which she sent through her bank account by NEFT.

“The man then demanded Rs 2,10,000 for an ‘anti-terrorist certificate’. She called the accused and asked if she should pay the sum or not. The accused told her to pay, saying it would be easy to convert the money into Indian currency later. She paid the sum.

She was similarly made to pay Rs 6,80,000 lakh for ‘RBI assistance’ and Rs 4,40,000 to ‘generate a code to release the parcel’.

The perpetrators also demanded Rs 17,00,000 for a ‘tax certificate’. She then Rs 3,00,000 but got suspicious and on inquiring with the RBI learned that no such charges are levied.

“By this time she had already paid Rs 17,28,000 to the cheats. She approached us with an application. We registered an FIR on Friday. We are tracing the mobile numbers from which she received messages and calls,” said DCP, cyber crime, Rajdeepsinh Jhala.

Panaji: Tourism stakeholders on Saturday said they were disappointed with the Budget as, for the second consecutive year, it had nothing to offer a sector that is going through a lean phase owing to less footfalls.

“A bit disappointing, we were expecting something better. We welcome the target of 100 airports by 2025, specialised grants to states that will boost tourism, and the setting up of museums,” president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa, Savio Messias, said.

Atish Fernandes, director at First Class Holidays, said there was nothing positive for tourism. “There is piecemeal heritage upgrade and minimal budget allocation. However, expectations were quite low in the first place,” he said.

A South Goa hotelier said the Centre has neglected the tourism sector and that there was nothing great to help elevate an industry that is facing tough times.

“When you don’t offer anything specific to the industry that has a potential to grow, one ought to feel neglected. It’s as if we don’t count,” the hotelier said even as he added that his hopes were buoyed after chief minister Pramod Sawant’s statements. “There is hardly any thing concrete to talk about,” he said.

Rourkela Chamber of Commerce and Industry members watch the budget proceedings

BHUBANESWAR: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement of a new tax regime for the salaried class, and the reduction of tax rates for those who choose to enter the new regime after giving up existing exemptions, has evoked mixed reactions among the ‘aam aadmi’ here.

While some have welcomed the announcement, others said the coexistence of two different tax regimes for people with income up to Rs 15 lakh per annum would lead to confusion, and send people hunting for the nearest tax consultant.

According to the finance minister’s proposal, persons earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7.5 lakh per annum will have to pay tax at 10 per cent, instead of the existing 20 per cent. Those with annual income between Rs 7.5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh will have to pay tax at 15 per cent as against last year’s 20 per cent.

People earning between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 12.5 lakh can pay tax at 20 per cent instead of 30 per cent, while those earning between Rs 12.5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh per annum will need to pay tax at 25 per cent. The tax rate remains unchanged at 30 per cent for those earning Rs 15 lakh and more.

Chartered accountant A K Sabat said taxpayers would now have to calculate to see which tax regime would serve them better. “I personally feel the older tax slabs were better,” he said.

Sabat was echoed by Manas Behera, a salaried man, who said two tax structures would confuse people. “The government should have reduced indirect taxes to tackle price rise,” he added. Another salaried person, Hemaprabha Das, however, said the tax announcement would help middle-class employees. “The reduction in tax rate will help us save money,” she said.

Some, like entrepreneur Tanaya Patnaik, said they were trying to understand the nuances of the announcement. “To be honest, I’m still going through the various segments of the Budget . It is a lot to process. I’m not sure how successful it will be in improving our economy,” she said.

Housewife Bandita Kar was more optimistic. She said the revision in personal income tax slab would help people save money, but added that the amount saved would not be enough to cover rising cost of essential commodities. “The budget does not have anything for senior citizens and women,” she pointed out.

CHENNAI: Love for one’s mother tongue should not develop hatred against other languages. To prosper in legal profession, proficiency in English is a must, Justice V Ramasubramanian, judge, Supreme Court, said while addressing a gathering of over 400 newly enrolled advocates.

“Love for Tamil and proficiency in English would take you places,” he said, while delivering a special address in the enrolment function organised by the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry here on Saturday. This apart, every lawyer must possess three qualities – hunger for knowledge, hard work and professional integrity. These three qualities would definitely give you all a successful career, Justice Ramasubramanian said.

Felicitating the advocates, Justice N Kirubakaran cautioned them of a section of lawyers who involve in kangaroo courts and other criminal activities. “There are two groups of advocates. One practices before courts and the other before police stations. The second category is the sin to the profession,” he said.

Pressing the need to be well-versed in English, Justice Kirubakaran said, “English is the passport to the entire world.”

On professional ethics, he said, “In your attempt to gather wealth you must not exploit your clients. You are entitled fee for the service you have rendered but not a share in the benefits ordered to your clients.”

Justice M M Sundaresh and Justice V Bharathidasan suggested the young advocates to work under a senior for at least for three years to learn the trade.

Earlier, delivering his presidential address, chairman of the council P S Amalraj informed the gathering that the council is taking steps to provide stipend to young lawyers in their initial years to help them stay in the profession. Senior advocate and member representing Tamil Nadu in Bar Council of India S Prabakaran said lawyers should be students life-long and never cease to learn.

Representative image

CHENNAI: A retired police head constable on Friday threw a chemical on the face of his pregnant daughter and attacked her in-laws when they tried to rescue her in Tiruvallur. The woman and her in-laws who intervened suffered burn injuries in the attack.

Police said B Deepika married her boyfriend B Saikumar last year against the wishes of her father. Saikumar, a resident of Veppampattu, works as an AC mechanic. He fell in love with Deepika a few years ago when they were neighbours.

But her father Balakumar was opposed to the match and moved his family from Veppampattu to Tiruttani. He began to look for a groom to marry off Deepika. But the woman left her family and married Saikumar. The couple moved to Bengaluru after that.

After Deepika conceived, Saikumar brought her to his parent’s house in Veppampattu. When Balakumar got the news, he went to Saikumar’s house and told his daughter that her mother was unwell. He asked Deepika to accompany him to Tiruttani.

After Deepika refused, Balakumar left the house but returned with three men and smeared her face with the chemical.

Hearing Deepika screaming for help, her mother-in-law Bhagyalakshmi and her sister-in-law Divya came to her rescue. The men threw the chemcal on the other two women.

Balakumar and his accomplices threatened Deepika’s neighbours and forced her into a vehicle. Saikumar’s father Balaji alerted the Sevvapet police station about the incident.

With police on his tail, Balakumar pushed Deepika on the road near the Veppampattu bus terminus and fled. Police and neighbours rescued Deepika, who, along with the other two women, had suffered burns. The three were admitted at a government hospital in Tiruvallur.

Police have registered a case and have launched a hunt for Balakumar and his accomplices. Police have sent samples of the chemical, that was used in powder form, for analysis.

108,['2/02/2020'],"‘Pick &amp; choose’ tax slab method may discourage savings, feel experts","This story is from February 2, 2020

Nagpur: The Budget proposal to give up all the deductions and pay tax at a lower rate has led to apprehensions that it will discourage investments into savings schemes and insurance products that qualify for a rebate.

Tax-payers can now choose between the old and new methods. The salaried class invests into small savings schemes like NSC, KVP, PPF, insurance to save tax. Even home loans are seen as tax saving mode.

Experts say paying at a lower tax rate without deductions will leave higher disposable income at the hand of an individual. The savings schemes may not look as attractive in light of the new pattern. There was also a view that it may not make any impact because people may still invest in the such product purely for the purpose investments, if not tax planning.

Chartered accountant Naresh Jhakotia says, if a person has a salary income of Rs10 lakh, the tax liability can be minimized to Rs13,500 after taking into account the standard deduction of Rs40,000. “It can be done by investing in schemes listed under section 80c, NPS, medi-claim and home loan. However, to bring down the tax to that level one has to park at least Rs4.30 lakh in various schemes,” he says.

Earlier, if an individual had made no investments, the tax on Rs10 lakh came to Rs1,12,500. Now by opting for the new system, a person earning Rs10 lakh has to pay Rs80,000 tax with no need to invest anywhere.

“There is also a concern that it may lead to a drop in demand for certain investment schemes. However, I don’t see any such scenario,” says Jhakotia.

Ranjit Dani, an investment adviser, says if taxpayers get a better deal without any investment, not many would be interested to park their funds in products that were generally seen as tax-saving plans. “An impact may be seen on home loans’ demand too,” he said.

“The new method, which also proposes to do away with deductions, will now also include all the compensatory allowances like those for conveyance and leave travel in taxable income. This will ultimately increase the liability,” says Kailash Jogani, a chartered accountant. He said investment into savings plan will be hit due to the no-deduction norm.

Insurance agent Bharat Parekh says people will now will be able to exercise their choice for investment and may go for higher paying products. “I do not see any impact on the demand for other products in which investment was normally done for tax saving. There is a class of investors which will continue with the old system,” he adds.

Sanjay Jaodia, a chartered accountant, says that the entire habit of savings by the middle class may be affected

Neeraj Wagh, a certified financial planner, says the mutual funds (MF) industry is unlikely to see a drop in inflow. “The no-exemption clause won’t affect mutual fund business as people have understood that investing here is the only way to beat inflation. Falling fixed deposit rates have fuelled the rush for MFs and today’s decision to abolish dividend distribution tax will help further. But the new tax regime is likely to see a fall in insurance policy subscriptions,” says Wagh.

Tax lawyer Manish Gopalani said this will increase the work for chartered accountants. “It is but natural that clients would demand to see both computations, which means double work for CAs. Also, there is a shift towards one time investments like tax saver FDs rather than getting stuck up in annual subscriptions, which is likely to affect investments,” says Gopalani.

Vijayawada: Even as the Bill on three-capitals is yet to overcome the legislative council hurdle and a batch of petitions is pending with the high court challenging the Bill, the state government has made its first move towards decentralising the capital .

The government issued an order late on Friday night decreeing the shift of vigilance commissioner and commissionerate of inquiries offices to Kurnool, which is set to be the judicial capital.

The GO 13 issued by chief secretary Nilam Sawhney stated that the state government on administrative grounds and after careful examination of the issue has decided that the office of vigilance commissioner and chairman of commissionerate of inquiries and member commissioners of inquiries shall function from Kurnool.

The GO further directed the engineer-in-chief of roads and buildings department and the collector of Kurnool to take necessary steps to identify buildings to relocate the offices immediately. Both the offices are now functioning from an interim government complex at Velagapudi in Amaravati.

Defending the GO, finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy told reporters on Saturday that the state government has the right and power to shift the offices whereever it wants to. Besides, the state government is committed to honour the Sribagh Pact (1937) and will establish the judicial capital at Kurnool to balance regional aspirations, he said.

Rajendranath added that the high court and all other judicial and associated offices will be established in Kurnool.

The decision to decentralise the capital was taken keeping in view the future, he said, adding that historically the Telugu speaking region has witnessed turbulence every 20 years over regional imbalances. “To avoid such situations we have decided to develop all regions equally by decenteralising the seat of power,” he said.

CHENNAI: Following complaints that some faculty members are working with fake PhD certificates in engineering colleges, Anna University has asked all affiliated engineering colleges to get genuineness certificates for PhDs of their staff from concerned universities.

In a circular to principals and chairmen of engineering colleges, the university raised doubts that some faculty members might have bogus PhD degree certificates.

“PhD degree holders are having doctorates obtained from different universities and (are) lending their names to more number of colleges. It is also suspected that some faculty members are having bogus PhD degree certificates and working in affiliated colleges,” the circular said.

“Hence, the chairman/principals of all affiliated colleges are requested to apply for genuineness certificate of PhD degrees of their employees from concerned university and produce it to the inspection committee. Attested copy of genuineness certificate and PhD degree certificate should be submitted to the university on or before March 16,” the circular added.

Around 7,000 professors with PhDs are currently working in around 500 engineering colleges in Tamil Nadu .

Recently, there were complaints from faculty members to university that some faculty members were working by producing fake certificates.

“Any department should have professors, associate professors and assistant professors in the ratio of 1:2:6. Due to fake certificate menace, many faculty members not able to get employment in private colleges. These faculty members were also working for very low salary,” professor from an engineering college said.

Anna University officials said it is difficult to verify the genuineness of certificate during inspection. “If faculty members produce PhD certificates obtained from outside the state or from private universities, it is difficult to find out their genuineness,” an official said.

CHENNAI: No sooner had Union finance minister Nirmal Sitharaman promised “comprehensive measures” for 100 water-starved districts than Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami raised his hand. “All water-starved districts in the state should be chosen for the Centre’s special programme and big funds have to be allocated,” said the chief minister.

EPS was being ambitious, but not without a reason. Drought-like conditions have been spreading across Tamil Nadu at an alarming pace, partly because of its inherent nature of its vast parts being in the rain-shadow region and partly because of climate change. Monsoon failure has left the state’s groundwater table overexploited. An assessment by the state public works department shows more than 60% of the state is short of water , the worst districts being Tiruvannamalai, Salem, Vellore, Thanjavur and Tirupur. Many of the districts including Chennai and Coimbatore overdraw groundwater.

Having been excluded from the Centre’s Atal Jal mission launched in seven states to strengthen groundwater resources, Tamil Nadu is keen to get a bigger pie from the proposed scheme. In December, the chief minister wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , pointing out that 541 of the 1,166 firkas (revenue sub-divisions) in Tamil Nadu fall under the ‘critical’ and ‘over-exploited’ categories and they should be included in the Atal Jal programme. The Centre did not respond.

In Vellore, 33 of the district’s 52 firkas and 37 of the 52 in Tiruvannamalai have been found to be overexploited. Lack of flow from neighbouring states have compounded the problem. A Ashokan, a member of a non-profit called Reversal of Ecology Committee, Vellore, said construction of check dams and increasing the height of dams across the Palar by the Andhra Pradesh government have led to further drying up of Tamil Nadu’s northern districts. “Even those living along the banks of rivers struggle for drinking water. Governments of the past and the present looked at water only as an election issue,” Ashokan said.

AHMEDABAD: A class-1 officer who works at the state secretariat in Gandhinagar has filed a police complaint of stalking and outraging her modesty against a Facebook friend, states an FIR filed with Sector-7 police. The complainant is going to retire within a year due to superannuation.

In her FIR with Sector-7 police of Gandhinagar, the woman, 57, resident of Sector-7 in Gandhinagar, states that she works at the post of deputy secretary at the state secretariat and an unknown man Upendra Raval, the accused in this case, was her Facebook friend.

As he kept sending obscene messages, the woman warned him not to send such messages.

“But even then he kept sending such messages which are against dignity of a woman. On inquiring about this man, I found that he had four different accounts on Facebook,” she states in the FIR.

She also said that she had first filed an application to register a complaint before Gandhinagar SP.

The accused had on October 2, 2018 sent an obscene video to the woman and also dropped his contact number. Using this contact details, the cops came to know that the man was a resident of the Isanpur area of city.

Asaduddin Owaisi

HYDERABAD: AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi took umbrage at sedition charges filed against a school headmistress in Karnataka’s Bidar for staging a play against CAA in her school. He expressed hope that the charges against the headmistress, Farida Begum , would be dropped soon. He met Bidar district SP T Sreedhara on Saturday in connection with the arrest of the headmistress of Shaheen Urdu Medium Primary School.

“Met with SP Bidar. We strongly objected to arrest & sedition charge for a school play. He said it’s under investigation & sedition maybe removed I said this should’ve been done before arresting these women as they are local residents. How can a school play be a crime? (sic)” he tweeted.

Farida and Najamunnisa, mother of a student, were arrested after social activist Neelesh Rakshal filed a complaint. An FIR under sedition charges was filed against them.

After meeting the headmistress and Navida in Bidar Prison, Owaisi tweeted: “In a condemnable incident, they were arrested by Bidar police for sedition in connection with a school play.”

Six children, who acted in the play, were below 10 and examined by cops in presence of their parents. Staffers of the school were also questioned.

Owaisi also opposed KTR’s idea of adopting Mumbai’s traffic model. “This is a primitive way of punishing entire traffic at a traffic signal because of few cars honking...,” he tweeted.

Bhubaneswar/Berhampur: The Budget proposal to develop 100 airports under the Centre’s Udan scheme has come as a boost to the prospects of Rourkela, Utkela and Jeypore to find a spots on the domestic flight map. The three smaller airstrips in Sundargarh, Kalahandi and Koraput districts, respectively, have been included under the Centre’s regional connectivity scheme.

In a recent meeting, civil aviation secretary P S Kharola and state government officials said the Rourkela airport would require an additional 41 acres for development of virtual flight rules (VFR) and 143 acres for instrument flight rules (IFR) to enable landing of ATR-72 flights under Udan.

The Rourkela, Utkela and Jeypore airstrips will be made operational under Udan IV, for which the Centre will start bidding this year.

The Birasal airstrip in Dhenkanal, which is now being used by the Government Aviation Training Institute (GATI) to provide flight training for aspiring pilots, may be included under Udan, as the state government has decided to make the airstrip fully operational soon. The Birsal airstrip had got approval from Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in November last year and started flying trainee aircrafts in December on a temporary basis.

Ganjam district’s pre-independent airstrip at Rangeilunda may also be one of the new airstrips to be included under Udan. Berhampur, the biggest commercial hub in southern Odisha, is yet to be connected with air travel. “We hope the Rangeilunda airstrip will be developed under the proposed scheme,” said former union minister and Berhampur MP Chandra Sekhar Sahu. Last year he had given a proposal to the Centre for development of an airport near Berhampur.

Panaji: A Budget speech of nearly two hours and 45 minutes the longest ever had very high expectations but ended in utter despair, AAP said on Saturday.

Party functionary Rahul Mahambrey said the Budget failed to lay out a path to give employment to the youth, announce measures to boost the housing and manufacturing sectors, or give impetus to the sluggish economy by increasing citizens’ spending power.

Mahambrey said the government had not thought about the present socio-political situation prevailing across the country, which involves the youth who are out on the streets. He said that it’s a steep climb for the government to achieve a 6.5% growth in the backdrop of six consecutive quarters of decline in growth figures.

While agreeing that an allocation of Rs 99,300 crore for education, up by 4.7%, was a good measure, the AAP functionary said a higher allocation was desirable .

“An allocation of only Rs 3,000 crore for skill development is awful. For a country that has a third of its population in the 15-24 years age group, a higher allocation to education and skill development was required as it would build a foundation for a stronger and resurgent India,” he said.

On the personal taxation front, Mahambrey said an option not to claim any deductions to avail lower tax slab rates would hit personal household savings. “This will affect young families who will be spending impulsive rather than building on their savings and wealth for later years,” he said.

Kochi: With job opportunities opening for healthcare providers in Germany and Japan, the proposal in the Union budget to introduce special bridge courses will benefit several nurses and para-medical staff in the state.

The courses, to be designed by the ministries of health and skill development along with professional bodies, will aim at ensuring that a candidate’s skill set matches the employer’s requirements and also meet the language requirements of various countries.

“In several countries, it is important to know the local language. While healthcare providers from Kerala are high in demand, often language is a barrier. Therefore, such an initiative will certainly benefit Malayalis,” said N Sasidharan Nair, chairman, Overseas Development & Employment Promotion Consultant Ltd, that functions under the state ministry of labour.

In 2019, majority of health care providers from the state were recruited in Saudi Arabia and United Kingdom. Incidentally, job opportunities for healthcare providers from the state is on a decline in Saudi Arabia, making it important for them to explore new avenues.

Teachers from Kerala are mostly in demand in Indian schools in the Middle East, UAE and Qatar.

“This discussion is not new. It has been going on for long. But nothing has happened on the ground yet,” said Aboobacker MK, director, Careers World Travels & Tradelinks, Kozhikode.

NCP president Sharad Pawar

MUMBAI: Reacting sharply to Budget 2020, NCP president Sharad Pawar said on Saturday it was the longest speech by a finance minister but was not far-sighted and lacked vision.

“The finance minister was expected to draft an action plan to revive the automobile sector and tackle the issue of unemployment. But she ignored both the crucial issues. There was lack of vision and no specific action plan was drafted to double the income of farmers,” he said.

State NCP president and water resources minister Jayant Patil called it a directionless budget and disappointing for the agriculture sector. “We expected a major action plan to tackle the agrarian crisis. But no steps have been taken for the welfare of farmers,” he said.

Patil further said at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was expected to take key decisions to revive the economy, no measures have been taken to restore people’s confidence. “No steps have been taken to halt recession in all sectors,” he said.

Patil said when GST was introduced, Modi had said it will help strengthen the economy of the states. But now, two years later, the economy of most states has collapsed and funds have not been released for them, he said. “The government’s decision to sell Air India reflects the state of affairs in the country,” said Patil. More shocking, he said, was the fact that Maharashtra and Mumbai have been ignored. “Since maximum taxes are recovered from Mumbai, we were expecting a better deal. Modi is concentrating on Ahmedabad.’’

Revenue minister and state Congress president Balasaheb Thorat described the Budget as meaningless and directionless. “Modi has ignored Maharashtra.”

Representative image

BENGALURU: A moviegoer who sued a city multiplex for selling him a 500ml water bottle for Rs 40 — double the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) printed on it — has won the legal battle. A Bengaluru consumer court has pulled up the multiplex authorities for illegal trade practice, ordering them to pay him a refund of Rs 20, compensation of Rs 5,000 and Rs 2,000 towards court expenses.

The proceedings began at 3rd Additional Bangalore Urban District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in September 2017 when Dasarahalli resident Om Hedge Uratota lodged a complaint against Cinépolis Royal Meenakshi Mall in Hulimavu, Bannerghatta Main Road .

Uratota had visited Cinépolis on June 7, 2017, and purchased a half-litre Kinley bottle. Much to his chagrin, the seller demanded Rs 40 even though the MRP was Rs 20, and told him a one-litre bottle would cost Rs 50. Following a brief argument, Uratota paid the money but he wasn’t planning to let the issue of illegal pricing go. He sent a legal notice to the mall authorities but didn’t get a response.

Uratota then approached the consumer forum against the multiplex on September 7, 2017, citing deficiency in service and illegal trade practice. The multiplex authorities, represented by an attorney, said the complaint was vexatious, false and frivolous. The lawyer said the multiplex offered top-notch amenities to customers and had obtained the required approvals from the government. The lawyer added users could drink free water from dispensers in the multiplex or buy bottled water sold on the premises through ‘select channels’ for Rs 40 for 500ml and Rs 50 for 1 litre.

The judges noted that colour photocopies of the Kinley bottle in question didn’t have an MRP printed on it or it had been possibly removed. They said the lawyer representing the multiplex mentioned about the facilities provided to customers but failed to provide justification for collecting Rs 40 for a half-litre bottle which is sold outside at an MRP of Rs 20.

The judges came down heavily on Cinepolis representatives for the illegal trade practice of charging more than the MRP and cheating customers. On the other hand, they lauded Uratota for his single-minded pursuit to fight such illegalities and not remain a mute spectator when his hard-earned money was being unlawfully pocketed.

In the verdict pronounced on January 16, 2020, the forum ruled that Royal Meenakshi Mall authorities, within 30 days, must refund Rs 20 with 12% annual interest to Uratota, who had been charged in excess of the MRP, and also pay Rs 5,000 as compensation for causing him mental agony. An additional Rs 2,000 should be paid to Uratota towards court expenses, the judges ordered.

Bones and other remains inside an urn found buried in Adichanallur in Tuticorin district

CHENNAI: Adichanallur in Tuticorin district is among the five archaeological sites that would be developed with on-site museums, said Nirmala Sitharaman, minister of finance, in her Budget 2020-21 speech. Rakhigarhi (Haryana), Hastinapur (Uttar Pradesh), Shivsagar (Assam) and Dholavira (Gujarat) are the others.

Adichanallur, a remote village, is home to a three-tier cemetery spread over more than 200 acres, one of the largest and oldest early Iron Age cemeteries in South Asia. While past excavations at Adichanallur brought to light many salient features of a composite culture that could bridge the gaps in the cultural assemblages of South East Asia, one conducted by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 2004-06, found 85 human skeletons in a squatting position in giant, dual-coloured clay urns. The report, however, took a long time to be filed.

In 2019, ASI submitted before the Madras high court’s Madurai bench carbon dating results of samples taken from Adichanallur and sent to a lab in Miami, Florida, and Kalina Campus, University of Mumbai. The report said one of the urns is aged between 696BC-540 BC (2,645-2,489 years) and 791BC-701 BC (2,740-2,650 years), while the other is from 905-806 BC (2,854-2,755 years). The division bench noted that the results proved Adichanallur was the earliest ancient site in Tamil Nadu.

Raghavan Pathmanathan, who studied the material excavated from Adichanallur, found its population included more than one ethnic group ans all lived together in peace. “The skeletal remains also prove their sea-faring trade activities. The cultural material unearthed reflect various stratum of the population that lived there.”

An on-site museum at Adichannalur, under ASI Chennai circle, is a great idea, say heritage experts. T Sathyamurth, former superintending archaeologist of ASI who headed the excavation in 2004-06it would help the site get the importance it deserves.

Sathyamurthy pointed out how Arikamedu in Puducherry, one of the earliest Roman sites in the Tamilakam lost its significance after being excavated in 1945-50 due to the lack of an on-site museum.

AHMEDABAD: A 46-year-old businessman from Vastral, Vatsal Patel, on Friday registered a complaint against a real estate broker, Bhupendra Patel, a resident of Santosha Nimlane in Adalaj, for attempting to extort Rs 1 crore from him. Odhav police have registered an offence under Sections 384 and 294(b) of the IPC against Bhupendra.

According to the FIR, Vatsal had bought a 4,401 square metre plot in Singarva from a farmer named Narsinh Patel in 2016. Vatsal stated that between June 2016 and July 2017, he had paid Rs 92,45,000 to Narsinh and only Rs 2,450 was outstanding.

According to the FIR, Narsinh had signed an agreement to sell the plot to Vatsal, and had promised to register the sale deed soon. However, he did not register the sale deed with Vatsal and instead sold the land to one Paresh Patel in 2019, along with a non-agricultural (NA) certificate.

Vatsal Patel and his partners learned about the sale to someone else on December 28, 2019, and lodged a complaint against Narsinh at Odhav police station.

Vatsal Patel stated in his FIR that before he bought the plot from Narsinh Patel, they had a series of meetings at which Bhupendra Patel was present, as the deal broker.

“Vatsal and his partners then went to Bhupendra Patel and told him that Narsinh had sold the plot to someone else and was refusing to register a sale deed with them despite them paying him in full,” a police source said.

The FIR states that after a series of meetings, Bhupendra told them that he would need Rs 1 crore to convince Narsinh to register the sale deed with them. Vatsal and his partners did not agree to this because they had already paid the full sum to Narsinh.

Bhupendra Patel finally bluntly told them that they should pay him Rs 1 crore or he would block the sale deed with Narsinh Patel.

Seers performing ‘Dhooni Tap’ at Khak Chowk area on Magh Mela campus

Allahabad: The sight of seers surrounded by dense smoke and meditating are drawing the attention of many a visitors at the Magh Mela ground in Allahabad these days.

Joining the rush to attain salvation during the Magh Mela, seers choose the strict ritual of ‘dhuni tap’ as a form of atonement during the 10-day period between the snans on Basant Panchami and Magh Purnima.

Performed along the banks of Ganga, the ‘sadhak’ (the person who performs the ritual) fasts for the day, meditates and prays in a fixed asan. The seer is surrounded by the thick smoke billowing from fires lit up using cow dung.

Also known as ‘panch agni tap’, this harsh form of self-denial is being practised by saints since decades. “This is among the oldest forms of penance and it also finds a mention in ancient Hindu scriptures like the Padma Puran and Shiv Puran. The scriptures mention Naga seers surrounded by fire and meditating for hours together,” said city-based astrologer Ram Naresh Tripathi.

The ritual starts with seers sitting around four fires, using cow dung, while the sun acts as the fifth source of fire.

As the ritual progresses, the numbers of fires lit up also increases. “The ‘sadhak’ then carries a fire pot on his head. The final stage of the ritual is called kapal dhuni, wherein the fire (dhuni) is lit up in a bowl (kapal),” he added.

During the ‘dhuni tap’, seers also offer food to the burning cow dung cakes, while reciting mantras. Having made the offering, the seers blow a conch shell to invoke the deity. This marks the end of preliminary rituals and the seer then proceeds to meditate.

Most saints perform the ritual between the sandy banks of the two bridges over Ganga connecting Allahabad to Jhunsi during the Magh Mela.

Magh Purnima will be observed on February 9.

125,['2/02/2020'],Octopus base likely to be shifted,"This story is from February 2, 2020

The Organisation for Counter-Terrorist Operations (Octopus) base is likely to be shifted to Visakhapatnam from Mangalagiri. Its over 25 km long coastline and the presence of other defence establishments in and around in the city make the region condusive for setting up the Octopus base.

However, a senior IPS officer said, “There’s no news of the base of Octopus being shifted out of the CRDA region. If at all it is shifted, the anti-terrorist wing would need around 100 acres of land to set up the quarters and training arena.”

Sources said, the base would be accommodated close to the Greyhounds. Earlier, there was a plan to set up a regional center of Octopus in Visakhapatnam with a unit of commandos. But with the government gearing to set up three capital, with Visakhapatnam as the executive capital, the plan is likely to be revised, said sources.

The question whether the base of Octopus would be moved out of Mangalagiri gains in importance because Octopus commandos replaced Greyhound commandos in the security cover of chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy last year.

126,['2/02/2020'],Electronics policy may help state get back on its feet,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Chennai: The new electronics manufacturing policy announced in the Union Budget , which seeks to encourage manufacturing of electronics and semiconductors in India, will bring Tamil Nadu back on its feet as a manufacturing hub after it lost out to Uttar Pradesh following the exit of Nokia in 2014.

India offers tremendous cost advantage in electronics manufacturing, and the sector has a high job-creation potential. Domestic manufacturing will also bring with it large investments, the finance minister said in her Budget speech.

Though industrial houses in the state, which is home to about 10 large electronic manufacturers and more than 300 small and medium manufacturers, are waiting for finer details, they are gung-ho over the policy.

The announcement couldn’t have come at a more opportune time for the state, especially with Foxconn, Flex and Salcomp announcing plans to expand or already expanding their

operations.

""In the next 12 months when we expect more clarity on the policy and definite action, we foresee a doubling of output from the state’s electronic manufacturing sector. If we focus on improving the ease of doing business, the state’s share would improve. Four of the largest EMS companies have their presence in TN and they will increase their investments,"" said George Paul, CEO, Manufacturers Association for

Information Technology (MAIT).

Salcomp, which has agreed to acquire Nokia plant in Sriperumbudur, is seeing heightened action. The company’s India MD, Sasikumar Gendham, said the new policy could accelerate its current plan to invest `2,000 crore and employ 10,000 people (direct employment) over the next five years.

Typically, at least five new indirect jobs are created for every direct employment.

Foxconn has resumed operations in TN with the highlight being assembling iPhones. Country head and India MD Josh Foulger, in an earlier interview, said the state has a $100 billion opportunity in the electronics manufacturing space.

Besides Foxconn, Flex is scouting for land in Tamil Nadu to increase its

manufacturing presence in the state by setting up a new plant. The company now has four facilities.

Vijai Sardesai

PANAJI: Goa Forward Party (GFP) president Vijai Sardesai said on Saturday that while the state government is taking suggestions for the Goa budget from the public, it forgot to give its suggestions to the Central government for the Union Budget.

He said that despite both, Central and state governments being BJP governments, there is nothing in the Budget for Goa. With this, he said, one can conclude that the state leaders promises have no weightage at the Centre.

Sardesai said that GFP, along with like-minded parties including Congress and MGP, will bring up this and other issues such as Mhadei and CAA/NCR/NPR for discussion at the upcoming state assembly session.

“The Budget was 2.5 hours long, but the stock markets are unhappy. The Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said it is below expectations where Goa is concerned. I don’t understand how farmers will benefit. This Budget is nothing but an exercise in grandstanding. The speech was so long that even the finance minister became uncomfortable. This is only being done because the Delhi assembly polls are coming up,” Sardesai said.

Sardesai also said that chief minister Pramod Sawant had announced at the start of the year that 5,000 jobs are being created, but that in reply to a question for the upcoming assembly session, the government said that state is ‘unable to quantify the number’.

He said that it is a matter of concern that a member of legislative assembly was threatened and some persons tried to extort money from him, yet the accused were barely kept one night in custody and released prematurely.

“It is a very serious issue. Every MLA can be a soft target. Mysteriously the people who were arrested were not kept in police custody. They were kept in judicial custody and within one night they were given bail. It is not even investigated by the police,” Sardesai said on Saturday.

He said that there are various types of speculations with regards to this case and everyone in the state has a right to know what the case was about.

Michael Lobo

CALANGUTE: Even as the state BJP government enforced The Goa Public Gambling (Amendment) Act, 2012, which debars Goans from entering casinos , party MLA and ports minister Michael Lobo on Saturday said Goans should be allowed to continue visiting them. He said there was a difference between entry and gaming and that Goans could not be stopped from entering casinos.

“There are other things in casinos besides gaming. There is music, entertainment, food, etc. Somebody will challenge this in court,” he told reporters at Parra. “Nepal and Sri Lanka have banned their citizens from gambling in casinos. Goans are Indian nationals, so you should not allow all Indians entry while not allowing Goans. This needs to be debated at the highest levels.”

Lobo said former CM Manohar Parrikar had amended the law to ban Goans from casinos following complaints that gambling had ruined people financially. He said there have been cases of people taking bank loans to gamble, hoping they would become rich instantly, only to lose their money. “Because of this, Parrikar had amended the law. This government is implementing the new law,” he said.

Coimbatore: The city corporation is planning to open parts of Valankulam and Periyakulam lakes, which are being beautified under the smart city mission, for public from March.

The civic body had proposed to beautify the bunds of the lakes under the ‘quick-win’ projects category. Restoration works are being carried out along the Perur Bypass side of Periyakulam lake at a cost of Rs 39.74 crore. Beautification of walkers’ plaza along Valankulam lake is done at a cost of24.31 crore and works are undergoing beneath the Valankulam flyover at a cost of Rs 23.83 crore. The works were flagged off in July 2018.

After floating decks were installed on the lakes and the bunds were decorated, people have been thronging the places. Commuters stop vehicles near the lakes to click pictures even though they are not allowed to access the premises as work is still going on.

A senior corporation official said that each project has about 450 components including floating decks, gardens, birdwatching towers, fountains, shade structures, bicycle tracks, benches, lamps and container restaurants. “As it is the first time beautification works are being carried out along lake bunds, it took the contractors more time to complete the work. They have planted 40 types of native plants along the lakes,” he told TOI.

Municipal administration minister SP Velumani had conducted a review meeting a few days ago, the official said. “The minister directed the contractors to speed up the work to complete it before March. Over 70% of the construction work, especially installation of important components, have been completed.”

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami is expected to throw the spaces open for recreation and relaxation to thousands of residents in March, the official added.

131,['2/02/2020'],Over 700 banks shut as strike enters second day,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Coimbatore: More than 700 branches of public and private sector banks remained closed on Saturday as the strike by bank employees demanding the central government to fulfil their demands entered into second day. More than 5,000 employees from 20 public sector banks and 22 private banks participated in the strike.

R Maheswaran, district general secretary, Bank Employees’ Federation of India, said, “Unlike other central government departments, we work six days every alternative week. Each day, we work for 11 to 12 hours. We have been undergoing tremendous pressure due to unregulated working hours and it is affecting our performance.”

He wondered whether it was too much to ask for regulated working hours and 5 working days a week that were already implemented in other central government departments.

The employees, he said, had long been also demanding the central government to scrape the new pension scheme, update the pension and family pension and allocate the staff welfare fund based on operating profit instead of net profit, but in vain.

Pointing out that public sector banks were offering the companies that create employment opportunities low interest rates, no service charge and no processing charge, Maheswaran said that would have an impact on the net profit of banks. “That’s why we have been demanding the government to allocate the staff welfare fund based on operating profit of the banks.”

The employees also want the government to revise their wages. While their demand is 20% hike, the government has expressed willingness to increase the wages up to 13.5%. During the recent talk that was held with the employees, officials had promised to recommend their demands to update family pension to the government, he said.

Bank Employees’ Federation of India has decided to stage a three-day bank strike from March 11, to press their demands.

Representative image

Allahabad: An Allahabad University ( AU ) faculty member on Saturday lodged an FIR against four senior professors — including the varsity’s former proctor Ram Sevak Dubey — for allegedly abusing him and manhandling him during a meeting on campus.

According to reports, the complainant DC Lal is a faculty member of AU’s physical education department. The four professors named in the FIR are Ram Sevak Dubey, Harsh Kumar, Pankaj Kumar and Rajesh Singh. The FIR was lodged at Colonelganj police station.

The FIR has been lodged under section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (punishment to for intentionally insults) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

In his complaint, Lal alleged that the incident occurred during a meeting of AU Teachers’ Association convened at the medieval and modern history department on Friday.

“When I raised the issue of conducting elections for appointing members of teachers’ union and the returning officer for the said polls, the four faculty members started abusing me. They made remarks against me and also manhandled me. They then pushed me out of the room by pulling at my collar,” Lal told the police in his complaint.

Of the four accused professors, Harsh Kumar is the former dean of student welfare, Pankaj Kumar is a former member of the UP Public Service Commission. Rajesh Singh is presently the superintendent of Tara Chand Hostel.

Inspector of Colonelganj police station Arun Kumar Tyagi said, “Lal has registered a complaint and on the basis of the same we have registered an FIR. We are probing the case.” The inspector confirmed that the four faculty members have been named in the FIR.

One of the faculty members accused in the FIR, Harsh Kumar said, “The AUTA meeting had begun with opening comments from Dubey. After him, Deepshikha Sonkar stood up to speak, but Lal interrupted her and raised the issue of conducting elections for appointing AUTA members. Pankaj Kumar had then alleged that Lal had been posting objectionable comments on a WhatsApp group of AU teachers. A number of teachers present at the meeting also objected to the posts.”

Officials said that in the WhatsApp group, Lal had alleged that teachers were being appointed in AU on the basis of commission.

Lal left the meeting and and lodged an FIR on Saturday.

“An incident, which was witnessed by so many teachers, has been misrepresented. There is no truth in the allegations,” said Harsh Kumar.

Lal also alleged that the accused used ‘jaati soochak’ (casteist) remarks against him.

Coimbatore: The postal department in the district received 15 ,764 entries for the annual letter writing competition, Dhai Akhar , as the last date for entry submission ended on Friday. While this is almost 10,000 entries less than last year’s 25,000 entries, officials are confident that this year too Coimbatore would top the number of entries from Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The competition was introduced by the postal department to inculcate the habit of letter writing among the current generation that is more technology driven.

Speaking to the media on Saturday, Sudhir Gopal Jakhere, senior superintendent of post offices, Coimbatore, said they had received 15,764 entries from students across 50 schools in the district as of Friday. The competition was announced in August with November 30 as the last date to submit entries. The deadline for submission of entries was, however, extended twice and fixed on January 31, due to shortage of stationary in post offices.

This year’s topic for letter writing competition is “Dear Bapu, you are immortal”. “The letter had to be written only on our inland letters or submitted in our postal envelopes,” Jakhere said.

According to another official, the competition also aims to create awareness on postal stationary, besides inculcating letter writing habit among the young generation.

While the competition is open to any member of the public, it will be judged in two categories - below 18 years and above 18 years of age.

This year is special for the district, as in a first it has got two visually challenged students from CSI boys’ high school to write their letters in Braille. “Though they wrote the letters from 5pm to 6.15pm, we have ensured that their letters have entered the competition,” Jakhere said.

Many organisations arranged big screens to watch the budget speech

Allahabad: The Union Budget 2020 evoked a mixed response from Allahabad citizens, most of whom welcomed the provisions for the middle-class and farmers of the country announced by finance minster Nirmala Sitharaman.

Chartered accountant Sunil Singh said, “The message the government tried to send across with this budget was welcoming. It focussed on middle-class taxpayers. All in all, it was a non-political budget which will boost the economy.”

On the other hand, city-based lawyer Manoj Kumar Singh ‘Lokesh’ said the allocations announced this year were disappointing.

“The cost of auto parts and medical devices equipment will go up. There is nothing for lawyers or to ease the struggles of the common man in getting justice. There is hardly anything to talk about in this year’s budget,” he added.

Meanwhile, housewife Pratibha rues the rise in prices of various commodities. “The finance minister announced several measures for farmers and the poor, but what about housewives who are struggling to run households with limited budgets? We have seen prices rises for almost every commodity including fuel. The government also did not say anything about how they plan to bring down the rising prices.”

Businessman Pawan Agarwal, who owns a construction company, said he was happy with the Budget as it sought to increase the spending ability of the common man. “However, I wish there were some provisions for construction and real estate sector, which is often stifled by strict laws,” he added.

Smita, a PhD scholar from Allahabad University, said that the lack of any announcements related to setting up of IITs or central universities left much to be desired from this year’s Union Budget.

“This is budget was mostly for the farming community, but even the salaried class would be happy with the new slabs of income tax,” she added.

Meanwhile, North Central Railway’s chief public relation officer Ajeet Kumar Singh lauded the announcement of new trains, especially the ones on the lines of Tejas.

“There are several announcements made by the Union finance minister in this year’s Budget. However, we would get to know the exact details about how they would affect the NCR only after the release of the pink book,” he added.

COIMBATORE: The Southern Railway has introduced an additional train between Coimbatore and Palani for 11 days to manage the rush during the Thaipoosam festival . The train will leave the city at 9.45am and reach Palani at 12.45pm. It will then leave Palani at 1.45pm and reach the city at 4.45pm. A day train to Palani has been a long-pending demand of rail activists and devotees, as the existing one leaves the city in the afternoon and reaches Palani in the evening, forcing devotees to either catch a bus for return trip or stay back there overnight and take the morning train to the city.

The railway on Saturday said it would run the special train service from February 2 to 12, to clear extra rush of devotees to the Arulmigu Dhandayuthapani Temple for the Thaipoosam festival.

Devotees, who manage to finish their darshan in an hour, could take the return train that would start from Palani at 1.45pm. Or else, they could take the train that leaves Palani at 5.30pm and reaches the city at 9.50pm. There is also a morning train that leaves Palani at 10.45am and reaches the city at 2.10pm.

Deputy speaker Pollachi V Jayaraman and MP P R Natarajan welcomed the announcement and said the special train was introduced based on their requests. Natarajan said he had demanded the train during the divisional rail users’ committee meeting on January 7, while Pollachi Jayaraman said he had officially written to the Southern Railway asking for the train in December and as recently as January 23.

The special train will have 10 coaches. Thaipoosam, which is celebrated in commemoration of Goddess Parvati giving Lord Muruga a “vel” or spear to vanquish evil demon Soorapadman, draws huge crowd to the Murugan temple in Palani. “More than the timings, we wanted to introduce just another train to clear the rush of devotees, who are otherwise forced to take buses as the existing trains become too crowded,” said a railway official.

At least 1,085 squatters have been occupying the marshland at five different locations.

V Karuna Priya, Chennai circle chief conservator of forests, said the department had been taking a series of measures to restore the marshland, evicting squatters by providing them alternative housing accommodation.

A total of 1,085 squatters are occupying marshland in five different locations. There are 70 in Mahalakshmi Nagar, Mettukkuppam; 100 in Dr Ambedkar Nagar, Veppampatti; 550 in Kamakshi Nagar; 115 in Quaid-E-Milleth Nagar and 250 in K P Kandan Nagar.

The department conducted biometric survey in August last year in Mahalakshmi Nagar and Ambedkar Nagar.

In Mahalakshmi Nagar alone, of the 74 encroachers, only 50 were identified as eligible ones, as others did not have correct address proof. In Ambedkar Nagar 102 encroachers were identified. All of them in the area were found to be eligible for getting tenements. For the remaining areas the biometric survey would be taken up soon.

To get the allotment in the Perumbakkam tenements, the department deposited Rs 34.78 lakh with the Slum Clearance Board in November last year.

District forest officer V Subbiah said this is the first time that encroachers of a marshland were being removed and given alternative accommodation.

Chennai-based biodiversity research organisation Care Earth Trust’s co-founder Jayashree Vencatesan said in 2002 when the first assessment of the marshland was undertaken there was already a loss of 90% of its original habitat.

Another challenge to the authorities is encroachers on the fringes of the wetland, as they are intensifying their efforts to convert the ecosystem into a habitable zone by dumping solid waste and compacting it with construction debris, she said.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With huge promises to improve railway infrastructure in the country, passenger associations are hopeful about the allocations for the state. Though no specific announcement were made for the state, electrification, utilising renewable energy and operation of trains in PPP modal were some of the proposals in the Union Budget.

P Krishnakumar, member, Zonal Railway Users’ Consultative Committee said that the investments for electrification of entire broad gauge network by 2023-24 is a good proposal.

“The proposal to complete electrification by 2023-24 will benefit railways financially. Also, the budget mentioned about operation of 150 passenger trains through PPP mode. There were proposals from state for tourist pilgrimage sector from Vasco da Gama railway station to Kanyakumari , trains to Tirupati and Madurai, etc. After railway budget was merged with the Union Budget, the details related to new trains and projects are published later,” said Krishnakumar.

Electrification is pending in Palakkad-Pollachi, Shoranur-Nilambur, Kollam-Punalur and Ernakulam Harbour route in the state. And Kochuveli-Guwahati triweekly train was among the trains proposed to be introduced by private entities.

“Considering the railway network in the state, the infrastructure needs more focus to benefit from the projects. And before introduction of new trains we need fund allocations for development of facilities to handle more trains here,” added Krishnakumar.

A railway official from Thiruvananthapuram railway division said that the budget is hopeful for development of railway network and Pink Book with details of fund allocations and projects will be published within two days.

142,['2/02/2020'],"Two leopards, two bears electrocuted in Maharashtra’s Ordnance Factory area","This story is from February 2, 2020

The animals were electrocuted in the forest patch under OF Chanda jurisdiction

CHANDRAPUR: Two leopards and two sloth bears were electrocuted by poachers in the forest patch under the jurisdiction of Ordnance Factory (OF), Chanda, in Bhadrawati town . The decaying carcasses of all four wild animals were recovered just 100 meters in the jungle, adjacent to the OF residential colony on Saturday morning.

The incident has also exposed the lapses in security in the high security OF under the jurisdiction of defence ministry. Forest department has launched an investigation into the poaching of four wild animals at once and suspect the involvement of local poachers hunting for bushmeat (wild herbivores).

Official sources claimed the electrified wire was 200 to 500 meter long. Initial investigations suggest the four animals were not killed at once, but at different times over the last four days. The electrocuted leopards and bears were male and female pairs.

The residents of OF residential colony came to know about the carcasses after they started emitting a foul stench. “After searching for the source of foul smell, people discovered the carcasses and reported the matter to the forest department. We have recovered some part of the wire used for electrocution,” said DFO, Chandrapur forest division, Ashok Sonksure.

He claimed that the poachers used the 11 KV electric power supply line to electrify the wire laid along the ground. Post mortem carried out on the spot confirmed death due to electrocution.

Sources claimed the animals came into contact with the electrified wire at different times. The dead bodies of the bears appear to have decomposed more than the leopards. It is also a mystery why MSEDCL did not share tripping data of this particular power supply, despite repeated power failure in short span of two-three days. The forest department has sought tripping data from MSEDCL to confirm the time of electrocution of the animals.

Officials suspect the poachers could be from village Piparbodi, located a few kilometres from OF Chanda. Source said two leopards had been seen roaming through the residential area of OF Chanda in the last few days. Videos of their prowling between the houses at night have gone viral on social media.

Several kilometres of dense forest lies adjacent to buffer zone of Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve under the jurisdiction of OF, Chanda, and is the habitat for many wild animals. Sighting of leopards, tigers and bears in OF locality is quite common. In fact, more than a dozen leopards have been captured from the OF area during the last few years. This poaching incident has, however, revealed that the poachers were using the forest stretch of OF, Chanda, and the security of defence facility was unaware of their repeated intrusions into the high security area.

Local Congress MLA Pratibha Dhanorkar has asked for an inquiry into the matter in a letter written to the state’s forest minister.

TRICHY: The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), Trichy region on Saturday launched four low-floor red buses on city routes and nine new mofussil buses to connect the city with various districts.

TNSTC officials said the state government on January 29 inducted 240 new city and mofussil buses for all the TNSTC divisions. Of these, Kumbakonam division received 35 buses and 13 were allotted to the Trichy region. Two of the 13 new buses were already launched from Chennai a few days back connecting Trichy with Madurai, Salem and Thanjavur districts. The remaining 11 new buses covering Trichy, Ariyalur and Perambalur districts were launched here at the Central bus stand.

Of the four city buses, two will be operated between Central bus stand with Chathiram bus stand via Thillai Nagar, while the other two will be run from Central bus stand to Viralimalai in Pudukottai district.

“Good to see TNSTC Trichy gradually inducting low-floor buses for city operations. Perhaps, air-conditioned city buses introduced in Chennai can also be run here connecting Srirangam, Thiruvanaikoil and Samayapuram temples,” K Janakiraman, a resident of No. 1 tollgate said. Locals also reiterated their demand to introduce low-floor buses from Chathiram bus stand to Thuvakudi connecting NIT Trichy.

Members watching the Union Budget presentation at Vidarbha Industrial Association (VIA) on Saturday

Nagpur: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced no new projects for the city in her Budget speech on Saturday.

The only benefit the city could get is engineering graduate students can do internship at Nagpur Municipal Corporation for up to one year. This will help keep third party check on all infrastructure development works being carried out in the state’s second capital.

Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in her Budget speech that students in the general stream (vis-à-vis services or technology stream) need to improve employability. About 150 higher educational institutions will start apprenticeship embedded degree/diploma courses by March 2021.

“NMC doesn’t benefit directly in the Central government Budget,” said a senior official from the civic body. NMC only gets the allocation under various Central government funded projects. Currently, NMC is implementing two major projects; AMRUT Yojana and Smart City. Whatever funds are allocated or increased for urban bodies, eventually NMC will also get benefits,” the official explained.

Under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, NMC has so far received Rs69.98 crore and is expecting another Rs266 crore for three projects including compost unit, MRF centre and BIO-CNG plant. Detailed project reports for these three projects have already been sent to the government for its nod.

Though no fresh funds have been allocated for existing Smart Cities, including Nagpur, it will not hamper ongoing work in area-based development in east Nagpur. An official from Nagpur Smart and Sustainable Development Corporation Limited said it has already received Rs196 crore from the central government, Rs148 crore from state and Rs100 crore from urban local body, and work for developing smart city project is underway.

Welcoming the Budget, mayor Sandip Joshi said the announcements like drinking water at every house, converting district hospitals into medical college will definitely improve amenities, including health services etc. According to him, all sectors have been covered.

BJP city president and former mayor Pravin Datke welcomed the Union Budget and said it has covered all sectors, like 16-point programme for farmers, and Rs90,000 crore for education sector, which is an all-time high. With other cities, Nagpur may also get benefit from Rs1 lakh crore allocation for infrastructural projects, he said.

Senior Congress corporator Praful Gudadhe termed the budget as misleading. Being a Union minister from Nagpur, Nitin Gadkari hasn’t been able to get the FM to budget for any new projects or industry for Vidarbha, he said. Educated unemployed youths would continue to move out of the city to other metro cities like Pune, Mumbai, Bengaluru etc, said Gudadhe.

City coordinator of Shiv Sena Nitin Tiwari expressed displeasure over the budget. Despite city MP Nitin Gadkari holding the charge of small scale industries, no funds have been allocated under this. The sector could have been provided lakhs of employment opportunities, he said.

Chennai: Another Republic Day has come and gone and again the list ofpeople named for the Padma awards lacks several luminaries of Tamil cinema , giving credence to the belief that political affiliations, not just talent or achievements, matter when it comes to such honours.

It is disheartening that despite their clearly evident contributions to cinema and the arts, greats such as M S Viswanathan , Nagesh , R S Manohar, M N Nambiar and P S Veerappa have not received any of the coveted Padma awards. Such awards lose their sheen when not given to the right people at the right time. Though the awards are not usually conferred posthumously, the government could consider honouring deserving artists, just like it did to BJP leaders Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley and socialist stalwart George Fernandes.

ALLAHABAD: Special Task Force (STF) on Saturday arrested four persons in Allahabad for allegedly supplying rectified spirit to illicit liquor manufacturers in the state.

The team also recovered 2,200 litre of rectified spirit, estimated to be worth Rs 11 lakh. The accused were identified as Ambuj Awasthi, Sopnu Shukla, Alok Patel and Yogendra Yadav. Awasthi, Shukla and Patel are residents of of Allahabad and Yadav is native to Kannauj.

Circle officer (STF) Navendu Kumar said, “STF had received tip-offs about the use of rectified spirit in manufacturing illicit liquor in various districts of eastern UP.”

On Friday, STF received a tip-off about a truck ferrying drums of rectified spirit having arrived in the city from Delhi. The truck was reported to be parked in Transport Nagar. “The informer had claimed that the drums were being loaded into a mini-truck and were to be supplied to Ambedkar Nagar and nearby districts in Bihar,” the CO said.

Based on the information, police raided the spot and recovered 2,200 litre of rectified drums from two mini-trucks. “Two persons were arrested from each of the two vehicles,” said CO STF.

During interrogation, the accused said they used to procure rectified spirit at a cost of Rs 25,000 per drum and sold them to smugglers at Rs 40,000 per drum. They also said that they were on their way to supply seven of the seized drums to one KK Pandey in Karchana and four drums to a house in Transport Nagar.

The CO said that efforts were on to arrest KK Pandey and others involved in this racket.

An FIR in connection with the case has been registered at Dhoomanganj police station.

BENGALURU: Terming the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) unconstitutional, a section of legal experts on Saturday claimed the National Population Register ( NPR ) is a prelude to the controversial National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and that both would have serious repercussions on citizens.

In his keynote address, former Supreme Court judge V Gopala Gowda said CAA, which seeks to confer citizenship upon people belonging to six minority religions in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, is a blatant violation of the Constitution. ""It is inexplicable as to why similarly placed people as well as non-religious groups in other countries have been left out, including about 88 lakh Tamils in Sri Lanka and Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar,” he said.

Regarding NPR, Justice Gowda said since the rules give more power to lower-rung officials, there may chances of crores of people losing out citizenship and being sent to concentration camps on the lines of what has been done in Assam after NCR, owing to whimsical action of officials.

Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan opined that institutions formed under the Constitution, right from Election Commission, CAG and even the judiciary, are either being attacked or taken over. According to him, under NPR, an individual is put at the mercy of local officials and based on the remarks which say “doubtful citizen”, he or she can even lose citizenship.

Former advocate general Prof Ravivarma Kumar said commencing of the NPR exercise before census-2021 virtually takes away the sanctity of census operations, wherein a person need not disclose his identity. Senior advocate AS Ponnanna termed CAA, NPR and NRC as traps laid out by the ruling dispensation, which seeks to turn the country into a “Hindu Rashtra”.

HYDERABAD: A day after the Ink Wash Summit was held in the city with sanitation as one of the primary agenda, municipal administration and urban development (MAUD) minister KT Rama Rao on Saturday directed the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to build 500 toilets in the next two months. However, only a few smart washrooms and eco loos will be constructed.

Civic officials are in the process of identifying locations to install these washrooms. “The location of these public toilets will be made available on a mobile app,” said a GHMC official.

These one-of-its-kind washrooms will be built on the lines of those set up by Loo Café which do not require water or septic tanks. The eco loos will use Swedish technology, which converts waste into liquid fertiliser and manure, which are primarily located in Jordan Mountains, heritage sites and places where there is water scarcity and no place to install a septic tank .

The washrooms will have integrated live toilet management system to monitor smell, footfall and hygiene from a command control centre. “This technology has been recognised as a path-breaking innovation by the United Nations ,” said Abhishek Nath , founder of Loo Café.

152,['2/02/2020'],Farmers ‘sabotaged’ pipeline to city to get water for farms,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Nagpur: Three of the seven major leaks on the water pipeline supplying raw drinking water from Pench reservoirs to the city have turned out to be sabotage. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) did not lodge a police complaint since ‘farmers caused the leaks to get water for farms’, said sources.

NMC now plans to shut down the pipeline for 45 days to repair the leaks, and also install seven electromagnetic flow meters at regular intervals to detect any future leaks. During this time, water will be brought to the city via canals. This may affect water supply, as any breach in canal will stop supply completely.

NMC had laid a giant pipeline of 2,300mm diameter in 2014 with funds under central government’s JNNURM scheme to bring raw drinking water from Kamptee Khairi reservoir, downstream of Pench reservoirs, to Mahadula Pumping Station. The water is supplied to treatment plants from pumping station. Around 550 million litres per day (MLD) water is supplied from the pipeline, which caters to over 70% of the city.

The 31km pipeline passes through farms and forests. Some leakages in the pipeline were causing loss of around 30 MLD water, enough for over 2 lakh people. Though detected one-and-a-half years ago, the civic body could not repair the leaks for various reasons, leading to huge water loss. Now, NMC proposed to undertake the repairs, and during inspection the cause of the leaks was discovered.

NMC superintending engineer Shweta Banerjee told TOI, “Leaks at three locations are man made. There might have been a minor leak in pipeline and miscreants expanded it. Or miscreants breached the pipeline. These are major leaks, from where huge quantum of water was going waste,” she said.

Banerjee did not comment on who caused the leaks. “We managed to bring down losses to 15 MLD through temporary works,” she said.

NMC water works department said farmers might be behind the leaks. “Systematic canals has been made to direct the leaking water. The canal ends in some farms. But NMC did not file police complaint as already farmers are facing various problems,” sources said.

There is low threat of contamination of raw water, as it is treated at water treatment plants and then sent to tanks before being supplied to households.

NMC first planned repairs during last monsoon, but had to postpone the plans first for low rains and then due to heavy rains. The plan was delayed after monsoon due to assembly elections in October and November last year.

Banerjee said shut down will be taken for 45 days to repair the leaks and also install seven giant full-bore electromagnetic flow meter at regular intervals on the pipeline. “NMC will bring raw water from canal of Kamptee Khairi to pumping station. There would be no water crisis,” she said.

Water supply will be affected in case of any breach in canals, considering past experience.

NMC will be able to narrow down location of any future leak by checking quantum of water flowing through the flow meters, which cost Rs2.80 crore.

IAN

* NMC laid giant 2,300mm pipeline from Kamptee Khairi reservoir to Mahadula Pumping Station to supply raw water in 2014

Coimbatore: The Union Budget evoked mixed response from industrialists, who were predominantly disappointed.

While a section of those running micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) welcomed the announcements such as exempting firms with Rs 5 crore turnover from tax auditing, extension of debt restructuring till March 31, 2021, and simplified GST returns from April 2020, others said the Budget has no other major announcements for MSMEs, automobile sector and electric vehicles.

V Lakshminarayanasamy, president of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI), Coimbatore chapter, said the Budget fulfilled 55% of expectations. “As the fiscal deficit target has been fixed at 3.8%, we can expect more expenditure to spruce up the economy,” he said and welcomed the announcements on agriculture and water harvesting “This Budget is better than the last one. But we have to see how much it would increase spending.”

R Ramamurthy, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries (Codissia), said the decision to announce national logistics policy would help MSMEs compete at the international level. Allocation of Rs 27,300 crore for industrial development is also encouraging, he said.

Meanwhile, J James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises (TACT), said the Budget was an overall disappointment, as it did not have any major announcements on GST and defence production. “We expected GST exemption for job-order, which was not announced. We had also demanded reduction of loan interest rates to 5%. There is also nothing on defence production in Coimbatore, which is disappointing.”

C Sivakumar, president of Coimbatore Tirupur District Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs Association (Cotma), welcomed the announcement on GST simplification and tax-audit exemption up to 5crore. “But our demands of reduced interest rates and giving 40% of turnover as working capital loans have not been met. This Budget is neither promising nor disappointing.”

K Maniraj, president of Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares Manufacturers Association (Kopma), said though 20 lakh farmers will be given financial aid to buy solar pumpsets, they would work only for five to six hours on sunny days and would be a waste of investment. “If electric motors are given GST exemption, farmers and manufacturers would benefit,” he said.

Regarding the announcements for textile sector, representatives of Indian Texpreneurs Federation said the announcement on abolishing anti-dumping duty on purified terephthalic acid (PTA) will be a big boost to the textile sector’s export competitiveness. The formulation of National Technical Textiles Mission will help tap the huge potential of the sector.

The industrialists also expressed disappointed over no announcement on new train services and infrastructure development in Coimbatore.

Chennai: Police on Saturday said they had cracked the January 26 theft of Rs 18 lakh at the Paranur toll plaza near Chengalpet with the arrest of four daily wage workers of a car manufacturing company. A hunt is on for a few more people. Investigators earlier thought a few passengers of an SETC bus, whose crew fought with the toll plaza staff, and a few others were behind the theft.

An officer said the images of the jerseys of the four, sporting the company logo, and their boots all caught on camera at the plaza were the key. Police, however, retrieved only Rs 1.19 lakh of the stolen money.

P Bhoopathi Raja, 26, of Salem, his face masked, was ‘caught’ walking away with the money. A team led by Chengalpet inspector D Stalin picked up Bhoopathi Raja before nabbing S Marimuthu, 26, of Mamandur, R Suresh Kumar, 29, of Chengalpet and D Jaya Vijayan, 29, of Gingee. Chengalpet deputy superintendent of police Kandan said police teams armed with images of the suspects fanned out in the neighbourhood. The four suspects will be remanded in judicial custody on Sunday.

On January 26, just after Chennai-Trichy SETC bus rolled to a stop at the Paranur toll plaza at 1 am, the staff there asked the driver to pay charges, though government buses are usually exempt from them. An argument broke out and the booth staff allegedly attacked the driver and conductor. While the bus passengers backed their crew, other bus drivers joined the fracas and the plaza was vandalised.

The next day police arrested Kuldeep Singh, 24, of Rajasthan and Vikas Gupta, 27, of UP, both staff members at the Panarur plaza, SETC driver Narayanan, 46, conductor Pasumpon, 38, both of Tirunelveli and Muthu, 37, of Chengalpet. What was then not known was that the four arrested on Saturday, along with a few others, cashed in on the opportunity provided by the attack on the plaza.

Trichy: Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector have expressed disappointment at the Union budget 2020 tabled in Parliament on Saturday. Entrepreneurs rued the lack of concrete announcements in simplifying the goods and services tax (GST) for MSMEs in filing tax returns.

Stating that the budget lacked focus on efforts to improve the business environment for MSMEs by paving way for more work orders, they claimed that extending the restructuring of non-performing assets (NPA) for one more year will not play a catalyst role in their business. “We expected more relief through a tax cut. While corporate tax ceiling stands at 25%, those who earn an income above Rs 15 lakh per year will fall under 30% tax slab,” R Ilango, president, Tiruchirapalli District TIDITSSIA said. tnn

Coimbatore: A 35-year-old female constable attached to Singanallur police station was suspended on Friday for misappropriating recovered stolen items. According to an inside source, constable Sapna Suja had stolen gold ornaments worth around Rs 50 lakh from the recovered items over a period of three years.

Suja, the source said, was the “court contact”, whose responsibility was to keep track of the station’s cases and produce recovered stolen properties before court.

“It was also her duty to coordinate with other police stations and collect recovered stolen properties in the cases that we were dealing with. She never used to hand them over to court or another station fully. In some cases, she hadn’t handed them over at all. Whenever she was questioned by sub-inspectors or inspectors, she used to say she had informed assistant commissioner or other senior officers and handed them over to some other police station,” the source said.

However, the newly-appointed inspector, Sivakumar, recently ordered a report on cases that were solved, recovered stolen properties and recovered properties that were handed over to victims or court. “It was then we realized that we were neither in possession of recovered properties in 11 cases, nor were they handed over to the victims. The same was also not recorded in the court’s recovery list,” the source said.

Following this, the inspector summoned Suja, seeking an explanation. She, however, went on long leave the next day after she was summoned.

Other sources in the station said Suja had been misappropriating recovered stolen properties ever since she joined the station four years ago.

On Friday, Suja was suspended for not submitting recovered stolen properties to the court, and not appearing before the court or police station when she was summoned to provide an explanation.

161,['2/02/2020'],School students recreate Sangam era literary works in Tamili script,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Trichy: Students of a private school in Karur district came together to recreate the original literary works of the Sangam era, written in the more than 2000-year-old ‘Tamili’ script, which is regarded as the first Tamil script. The effort is an attempt to further popularise Tamili script.

Sangam literature was originally written in Tamili and these works were changed to the present form of Tamil language by successive scholars.

About 4,500 students from Bharani Park institutions in Karur district sat together to recreate the 36 literary works in Tamili. All the works running into thousands of pages were recreated in Tamili in 24 minutes as hand-written manuscripts, thereby making it to the record book.

Dragon A Jetlee, founder, Jetlee Book of Records and chief adjudicator acknowledged and certified their work. Jetlee said there has not been any similar attempt so far.

C Ramasubramanian, senior principal, Bharani Park institutions said that Pathitrupathu - one of the early works of the Sangam era was recreated in three minutes and 41 seconds by the students. Sangam literature was written by various saints across 1,000 years and is said to be the oldest form of literature found in Tamil language, he added.

Lauding the students for doing service to Tamil language, V Ramaraja Pandian, chairperson, school of Tamil studies, Madurai Kamaraj University termed it as one-of-its-kind attempt at such a young age.

“Not many, especially the younger generation may be aware of the Tamili script and Sangam literature. Such attempts will popularise Tamili among youngsters,” he said.

The school has not just stopped with teaching Tamil language to the students but also encouraged them to learn Tamili script. The idea is to preserve the heritage and tradition of the language and pass it on to the next generation.

KANPUR: Additional district and sessions judge, Vinay Kumar Singh , on Saturday rejected the bail applications of Adil and Mustaqeem, the accused in the recent Babupurwa riot case. Police had charged them under sections 147/148/149/332/353/336/307/188/427/34/109 of the IPC and also under section 3/4 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984, the Arms Act and the Criminal Law Amendment Act.

Moving Adil’s bail application, his mother Shaheen claimed that his son had falsely been implicated in the case. She stated in her affidavit that on December 19-20, 2019, as there was a marriage of one of her relations, the relatives and family members were staying at Bagahi Eidgah ground to guard marriage articles. While Adil and other relatives were removing the articles, a stampede took place in the area and her family members and some young boys stayed there at the Eidgah.

After some time, the police entered the Eidgah and caught Adil and framed him in riot and other charges, she stated in her affidavit. In support of her claim, she submitted a marriage card and claimed that the police had neither any proof nor any video clip which could show that Adil had indulged in the violence. Moreover, there was no recovery of any arm or ammunition from Adil and that he has no criminal record.

Mustaqeem’s mother Afroz, who moved his bail application too took the plea of marriage in her house held at Eidgah ground. She also pleaded that following a stampede taking place at the Eidgah, the police reached there and arrested Mustqeem.

Opposing the bail applications, ADGC Shiv Bhagwan told the court that on December 20, 2019, after the namaz was over, the accused along with other co-accused started hurling petrol bombs, acid bombs and the bottles containing acids at the police party due to which the body protectors, cane shields, helmets and vehicles were damaged and then the police had used force on the order of the magistrate.

The prosecution stated that around a dozen cops had suffered injuries. Moreover, the accused and the co-accused had burnt the motorcycles of the police. The field unit collected empty shells of 12 bore and 315 bore cartridges and bottles used in petrol and acid bombs, and the accused and the co-accused were arrested from the spot, the prosecution alleged.

The court went through the evidence on record and the police report in which they had claimed that charges under section 302 of the IPC had also been added against the accused.

The court said that under those circumstances and after considering the evidence oral and documentary, there was no ground to grant bail to the accused and hence the bail applications of the two accused were being rejected. The bail applications of two other co-accused Shahzad and Parvez Alam had already been rejected earlier.

CHENNAI: An unlicensed common sewage treatment plant being operated by Tiruvallur municipality has come under the scanner of National Green Tribunal as activists moved the latter saying untreated effluents were being let into the Putlur lake.

The southern bench of NGT comprising Justice K Ramakrishnan and Saibal Dasgupta has given three months for a joint committee, monitored by Tiruvallur collector, to submit inspection and action-taken reports, in case any violation was noted.

The matter came to light after R Gokulraj of Tiruvallur filed a petition in NGT seeking action against officials responsible for unsafe disposal of treated sewage. It is being operated without obtaining consent from Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), the petitioner said.

Established in 2014 by the municipality, the treatment plant handles waste from houses in all 27 wards by collecting them through underground sewer lines. Treated water from the CSTP is then let into the take. In October 2019, the TNPCB inspected the plant and issued a show-cause notice to rectify certain defects failing which the plant will be closed, said counsel appearing on behalf of the board in response to the case.

The municipality claimed that lake was dry during most of the year and discharging treated water into it would neither pollute it nor affect ground water quality.

Seconding them, the PWD said at present there was no irrigation based on lake and permission was granted only after ensuring that there was no inflow of water from nearby catchment area. However, TNPCB inspection found out that Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) levels exceeded the permissible limits.

State president of Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) farmers’ wing Puliyur Nagarajan listed out the unfulfilled expectations such as waiver of crop loans, fund allocation for river-linking projects like Vaigai-Gundar and Nadanthai Vazhi Cauvery scheme. “Farmers are unhappy that the budget made no mention of fund allocation for crucial projects that can be a stimulus to the agriculture sector in Tamil Nadu,” said Puliyur Nagarajan.

Stating that sustainable cropping pattern and involvement of more technology can be achieved in cooperation with the states, the finance minister unveiled a 16-point action plan for boosting agriculture development. Tamil Nadu Tank and River Irrigation Farmers’ Association saw the Budget as unimpressive for the farmers despite providing some sops. “Allocation of Rs 2.83 lakh crore, 16-point action plan and crop loans are appreciable. Yet, there was no announcement on reduction of premium on crop insurance,” said association state president P Viswanathan . State spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh N Veerasekaran said, “We thank the government for considering our demand to have facilities to help market organic agriculture produces,” he said.

Meerut: The choice of Hastinapur for ‘iconic’ development of an archaeological site by FM Nirmala Sitharaman has brightened the prospects of the 2,073 sq km wildlife sanctuary of the same name near the town.

Though less than 100 km from Delhi, the sanctuary is the least explored in terms of tourist footfall. Despite being a pilgrimage site and so close to the sanctuary, tourists shy away from exploring Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary because of the lack of adequate lodgings and other facilities.

Divisional forest officer, Meerut, Aditi Sharma said, “The Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary is the biggest in the region spread across five districts of western UP along with Ganga corridor. It has everything from migratory birds, wetlands, gharials and swamp deer. Now, with Hastinapur (town) figuring in the Union government’s development plan, the sanctuary will certainly benefit in terms of tourism. Besides, the ongoing joint endeavour of UP forest division and WWF India in the conservation of threatened species like gharials, dolphins and turtles will also get a boost.”

Additional chief conservator of forest, biodiversity department, UP government, Mukesh Kumar said, “We are already in the process of developing the sanctuary as a tourism site and this announcement will give further impetus. Instead of permanent structures, we will have makeshift tents as lodgings close to the river.”

Joseph Zaidi, a bird enthusiast, said, “Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary is a perfect getaway for Delhi weekenders but lack of basic facilities like safety, lodgings and food is a big deterrent. If Hastinapur is developed, it will certainly attract wildlife tourism as well.”

Chennai: Residents installing rooftop solar plants will now be able to apply for net meters online on Tangedco’s website. The facility was launched early this week and the link is up on the state-run discom’s website, an official confirmed the development.

This is likely to resolve a major headache of residents and commercial establishments which install rooftop solar plants. Currently the process of getting a net meter is tedious. Wait for a meter may be close to six months for many city residents with no clarity on when it would be received. Only if a net meter is received, can the resident start enjoying the benefits of the rooftop solar plant as the device would calculate the number of solar units generated. The bill generated would be based on the net consumption after the net solar units are exported to the grid.

The online system ensures residents can track their application and raise queries about delays.

Tangedco sources say net meter installations will now be completed in 15-30 days and applications for all LT connection is likely to be made online from February.

According to the 2019 solar policy of the state government , commissioning of a solar rooftop unit should be completed within 3 weeks. ""However this process is riddled with delays, red tape and bribes demanded by lower level officials,” said R Ramalingam, of South Chennai.

Representative image

MUMBAI: Farmer groups in the state are unhappy with the allocation made for agriculture and allied activities in Budget 2020 .

According to the Budget analysis by the All India Kisan Sabha , in 2019-2020, the Union government had budgeted a total of Rs 2.7 lakh crore for agriculture and allied activities, rural development and irrigation, all put together. This year, only an increase of Rs 15,000 crore has been made, taking the total allocation to Rs 2.8 lakh crore.

“The Budget did not focus on agricultural processing or waste reduction. There has been talk of zero budget and traditional farming but the use of technology in farming is being neglected,” said Ajit Navale of the AIKS.

Navale said key issues such as setting up of godowns and warehouses and ways to ensure farmers get better rates were not addressed.

He said last year under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana, small and marginal farmers across the country were to get Rs 6,000 annually. Of the Rs 75,000 crore budgeted for the scheme, merely Rs 43,000 has been spent, which has benefited only eight crore farmers in the country.

Congress’s Balasaheb Thorat said the government scheme to double farmer income by 2022 is unrealistic. “This would need a growth rate of at least 11%, which is currently at 2% due to faulty policies of the government.”

MADURAI: A 35-year-old construction worker who recorded the video of his friend’s wife bathing and demanded ransom from him to delete it was murdered by the husband and two of his friends. Tuticorin district police have picked up the man and are on the lookout for his accomplices.

The murder which happened on January 25 came to light only on January 31 when foul smell from the decomposed body of the man emanated from a private farm land near Thirumangalakurichi near Kayathar. Initially, the police faced difficulty in identifying the man as the body was decomposed. It was sent to Tirunelveli government medical college hospital for autopsy, which confirmed cut injuries and stabs on the body. During inquiry the police led by deputy superintendent of police M Jebaraj identified the deceased as D Miltonraj, a construction worker from Kammapatti near Kayathar.

The man is married and has a three-year-old son but is separated from his wife. While tracking the call details of the victim they narrowed down on a fellow construction worker A Vijayan of the same village. Vijayan lives with his wife and three children. The two men used to work at the same construction site and also consume liquor.

According to the police, preliminary inquiry revealed that recently the duo was consuming liquor when Miltonraj showed Vijayan a video and pictures he shot on his mobile phone. Vijayan was shocked to see that it was his wife bathing which was recorded without her knowledge. An argument ensued between them and Miltonraj demanded ransom to delete it. Vijayan sought some time to arrange the money. He called Miltonraj on January 25 and promised to give him the money that the latter had demanded. Vijayan took him on his bike to Othaveedu, where two others also joined in murdering him with knives and screwdrivers and abandon the body. On Saturday, the police secured Vijayan for questioning. The police said that Vijayan tried to mislead them during investigations to protect his accomplices and further investigations were under way.

ddsfdfsfdsf

Kanpur: The city’s leather industry is a little disappointed with the budget presented by the Union finance minister in Parliament on Saturday.

Commenting that leather industry also needs an uplift, former chairman of Council for Leather Export (CLE) Mukhtarul Amin said that increase in import duty would benefit the domestic industry, but on the other hand, the enhanced duty on components in the leather industry would hurt the industry which was already crawling due to some decisions taken by the state government.

He said though this was just a proposal and would be discussed in the house, but a delegation of the leather industry would meet the Union finance minister and request her to reduce the duty on components so that the industry can be run properly.

General secretary, Leather Industries Welfare Association, Asad Iraqi, said that the industry was expecting some relief, especially due to its present condition. “The budget is a great disappointment for the leather industry”, he said.

The budget experts, however, evoked mixed reactions. Bhagwan Jagwani, director, Allen House Colleges said the budget has given an indication of growth and vision in India because the finance minister tried to cover the maximum fields in her budget.

Govind Maheshwari and Rajesh Bajpai, both chartered accountants, stated that they were hoping an increase in the home loan sector limit but that was missing. “The budget has withdrawn the mandatory provision of an audit by a chartered accountant for companies having a turnover of Rs 5 crore or more. It is good for businessmen but against the chartered accountants”, they said. They have however praised the initiative of minimum governance and extension of disposal scheme of income tax matters of Rs 4 crore or more.

Anuradha Varshney, chairperson, Flow, Kanpur Chapter while welcoming the budget stated that it was in the interest of women associated with the Agri sector, middle-income group employment, and industry.

President, Kanpur Income Tax Bar Association, Deep Kumar Mishra, said that planned investment in Agri, rail, milk production and fishery, 100 new airports, data centre park etc would push the country towards development. Baby Rani Agarwal, principal of Mahila Degree College said though the budget was good there was a need for more tax reforms. The taxpayers should have been given some more facilities, she said.

In a debate on budget held at the Allen House, the banking experts welcomed the enhanced guarantee of the finance minister on investors’ deposits from Rs 1 to 5 lakh and said it was a right measure to secure the deposits of the people.

Announcement regarding reduction in income tax rates would bring a smile on faces of middle-income groups, said a tax expert

Madurai: The Union government’s ‘one nation, one ration card’ scheme was kick-started in Tuticorin and Tirunelveli districts on Saturday as a pilot project in the state.

“The software used in the public distribution system (PDS) shops has been updated in the two districts. We will closely monitor stock in the shops and study if there is any defect in the stock movement or handling,” Tuticorin collector Sandeep Nanduri told TOI.

Stating that they have allotted 5% more stock in each PDS shop – compared to their usual quota, Nanduri said that successful implementation of the project in these two districts will be studied for a month before the state government implements it in the other districts. He added that 41 ration cardholders from Tirunelveli and other parts of Tuticorin district made their purchase under the scheme on day one.

Elaborating on how the scheme functions, Nanduri said that there are 4,93,842 PDS cardholders in 957 PDS shops in Tuticorin district. Similarly, there are around 4.5 lakh cardholders in nearly 500 shops in Tirunelveli district. Cardholders of this region temporarily relocate themselves for a considerable part of the year within the district or neighbouring districts or states in search of jobs.

The scheme is aimed at helping such people so that they can get their monthly quota of provisions in a hassle-free manner at the place where they are working, instead of missing their quota or travelling all the way to the shop where they are registered for the monthly PDS purchase. Kerosene is exempted from the scheme as it can be purchased only in PDS shops where the card has been registered.

Since it is a pilot project in two districts, the scheme is implemented only for cardholders of Tuticorin and Tirunelveli. The only limitation is that the cardholders cannot buy in another shop located in the same ward or revenue village where the card is registered. On the software front, the PDS card details of all the cardholders in the two districts has been fed into the point of sale machines of every PDS shop to make the transaction possible.

“On full-fledged implementation it will help the migrant workers from Bihar, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh working here to buy their provisions,” an official said.

Nagpur: Gittikhadan police on Saturday arrested dreaded goon Akhilesh alias Pappu Mishra for allegedly threatening and demanding Rs 2 lakh per month from an employee of AG Enviro, which is one of the two garbage collection agencies of NMC for allowing them to work in Gittikhadan area.

Senior PI of Gittikhadan police station, Sunil Gangurde, said, “The accused had demanded Rs 2 lakh per month from the complainant for letting him carry out work in the area. The complainant had initially gone to Sadar police station, but the incident took place under our jurisdiction and so, we registered the case and arrested him.”

Gittikhadan police officials have booked Mishra for extortion, assault and criminal intimidation.

According to police, Sachin Chavhan, a vigilance executive at AG Enviro, was approached by Mishra who claimed to be the president of Akhil Yuva Sangram Kamgar Union. Mishra demanded Rs1 lakh for his organization and an additional Rs1 lakh for himself for allowing Chavhan to carry out garbage collection in the area.

He threatened to destroy and set on fire garbage collection vehicles if Chavhan did not comply with his demand. He also told Chavhan to employee 200 of his men.

“When I refused to agree to his demands, Mishra threatened me at different locations. He also came to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) with around 40 people and ordered them to attack me,” said Chavhan.

Sources said that Mishra used to collect protection money commonly known as ‘hafta’ from employees of the previous garbage collecting agency. As the old agency was replaced by two new ones, he was threatening them and demanding money.

It is learnt that Mishra has around 25 offences registered against him, including rioting and robbery. In 2015, he was externed from the city limits for criminal activities.

Meerut: Hastinapur figuring in the Budget speech of Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman among the five archaeological sites that Union government proposes to transform into iconic sites across India with on-site museums, has brought a wide grin on the faces of historians and archaeologists alike. The town that finds mention in the Mahabharata as the capital of Kauravas, is situated 18 km from Meerut in western Uttar Pradesh.

During her Budget speech on Friday, Sitharaman said, “Five archaeological sites will be developed as iconic sites with on-site museums. These sites are Rakhigarhi in Haryana, Hastinapur in UP, Shivsagar in Assam, Dholavira in Gujarat and Adichanallur in Tamil Nadu.”

Experts said the FM’s announcement brings hope for an extensive archeological excavation in the historic town.

The only time an exhaustive excavation was conducted here was in 1950 by prominent archaeologist BB Lal, which revealed a large amount of artefacts, including iron nails, axes, knives, spearheads, painted greyware pottery etc.

“Since Hastinpur has been mentioned in the epic as the seat of Kaurava-Pandava conflict, sustained survey of the region could have resulted in possible evidence of Mahabharata. Now after 70 years, it is certainly a golden opportunity. I am sure there is a huge amount of history embedded beneath earth. A sustained excavation is the need of the hour,” said Prof KK Sharma, HoD, department of History, Multani Mal College in Modinagar.

Sharma was instrumental in the excavation of Sinauli, another archaeological site, in Baghpat that revealed biggest burial site of the region in 2007. In 2018, in a first-of-its-kind find, remains of chariots were excavated from the same site.

“Hastinapur is a key Mahabharata site. There is little on the ground in terms of ruins as such, but we have rich and detailed literature to back the importance of this site. ASI has artefacts which can be shifted to the proposed museum and facilities like light and sound shows can draw tourists. In fact, I suggest the nearby sites like Barnawa in Baghpat and Kurukshetra in Haryana can also be interconnected into a circuit,” said Kamal Sharma, former superintending archaeologist, ASI.

At present, Hastinapur is a spiritual pilgrimage centre for Jains that draws a great number of devotees to Jambudweep and other sites here. Besides, it is an important site for Sikhism as well.

According to Prof KK Sharma, “One of the Panj Pyaras chosen by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699 – Bhai Dharam Singh – belonged to Saifpur village in Hastinapur, which has a famous Gurdwara here. So, it is a multicultural and multi-religious site that can be developed into tourist and spiritual attraction.”

Uttar Pradesh tourism minister Neelkanth Tiwari told TOI, “As far as tourism is concerned, we had been gradually developing the town from our end; but for historical and cultural development, we had been seeking Union government’s intervention both in terms of resources and funds. In fact, we had an elaborate meeting in this regard in September last year with various Union ministries.

186,['2/02/2020'],"Now, cyber conmen pretend to be police to dupe people","This story is from February 2, 2020

Vijayawada: Cyber crooks have come up with yet another modus operandi to steal money—by posing as cybercrime cops from Delhi, or as an executive from Vodafone. Two such instances were reported at Machavaram and within Krishna Lanka police limits. Krishna Lanka cops, who did not wish to reveal the identity of the complainant, said a person lost Rs 7.7 lakh.

Similarly, in Machavaram cybercrooks stole Rs 1.07 lakh from a complainant.

Explaining the modus operandi, cybercrime police said that the miscreants contact the victim pretending to be Delhi cybercrime sleuths. They first intimidate the person by accusing them of committing various cybercrimes. Then they pretend to be a Vodafone executive and claim they have received a complaint against them for committing a cyber fraud.

The miscreants then explain that the victim’s SIM card might have been cloned and seek their assistance to declone it. This is when they request the victims to download a screensharing application like Team Viewer, after which the crooks collect bank details and the One Time Password (OTP), which will allow the cyber crooks to steal the victims’ money from their accounts. “Do not download any links or applications, or provide OTP numbers to a stranger,” the city police advisory reads.

While the modus operandi has been proven, Vijayawada also witnessed a case where Gurugram police slapped a Rs 3 lakh cyber fraud charge against a local on January 26. Sarath (name changed), the local resident, then approached the city cybercrime police who investigated the incident and found that he did share his Aadhaar card, PAN card and bank account details with an unidentified person through WhatsApp. Sarath lost Rs 1,750 but had not lodged a police complaint.

Madurai: Residents of Madurai should come forward to participate and vote in the Ease of Living Index Assessment survey being conducted by the ministry of housing and urban affairs, said minister for co-operatives Sellur K Raju.

Speaking to reporters at Alwarpuram in Madurai during the mass cleaning campaign held as part of the Namma Madurai programme of Madurai Corporation on Saturday, Raju said the citizens perception survey will help understand the quality of life in the city from the citizens’ perspective. The details obtained would be compared with the global as well as national data.

It is being conducted in 114 cities across the country including Madurai. The survey covers various topics including hygiene, safety, greening development, education, roads, electricity facility among others. Citizens can log onto Eol2019.org or scan the QR code for the survey and participate in it. They would have to answer 24 questions, the minister said.

Later, the minister inaugurated the cleaning campaign in which 150 volunteers, 400 students and about 600 workers of the corporation participated and cleaned the banks of river Vaigai. They removed the plastic wastes and other garbage dumped on the riverbed between Alwarpuram and Kuruvikkaransalai. Corporation commissioner S Visakan, city engineer S Arasu among others participated.

In the morning, the minister flagged off a marathon in which more than 400 children participated stressing the importance of a clean Madurai. The ‘kidathon’ was flagged off from the Gandhi Museum.

188,['2/02/2020'],HR headache of 2 tax systems,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Managing payrolls could become an administrative nightmare for large employers as the new tax regime kicks in. Experts said organisations will need to put in efforts to counsel employees on the new tax regime before April 1 this year.

Employees whose salaries fall in the respective tax brackets where the tax reduction benefit is being offered — earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh per annum — will have to decide on the path they want to pick. If they choose to continue with the existing tax regime (let’s call it plan `A’), and decide to claim deductions from their investments in tax saving schemes as they do every year, then the organisation would not make any changes to the manner in which their taxation is computed.

However, if they opt for the new tax regime (say Plan B), they will have to declare this intent to their employers before March 31, this year. Once employees opt for the new tax regime they will not be able to go back to the old one. For employees opting for Plan B, it will be more straight forward as tax will be deducted upfront from the employees’ salary.

Aditya Birla Group director HR Santrupt Misra , said, “Compensation of employees will continue in the same manner. We will have to, however, counsel employees on the two taxation paths, explaining the implications and possibly creating a helpline which can assist employees with any kind of queries. Once employees voluntarily declare which tax path they would like to opt for, the organisation will format and compute it accordingly.”

PwC partner (personal tax) Ishita Sengupta , said moving to the new optional tax regime could be a huge administrative exercise for the HR and payroll departments of organisations who will have to figure out how they are going to run alternative payroll if they wish to offer this option to the employees at the withholding stage.

“Employer organisations may have to explain the changes in the tax regime and related impact which can vary from case to case. Suddenly, for employees who opt for the new regime, it would mean giving up on a whole bunch of exemptions they earlier sought, such as LTA, HRA. Depending on what they were claiming earlier and are now foregoing, some may even end up paying more. Perhaps, a familiarisation process can be undertaken for the employees, with the help of tax experts,” said Sengupta.

Freshers and young employees, with incomes below Rs 15 lakh, might be the target for Plan B while a majority of the employees in the middle and upper bracket might stick with the earlier tax regime. What is absolutely clear is that it will add to the paperwork of most companies with the finance departments racing to provide thousands of employees with options on how the two schemes work.

189,['2/02/2020'],To pay or not to pay: I-T changes leave Gulf NRIs confused,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Hyderabad: The proposed amendment to Income Tax Act to tax non-resident Indians (NRIs), who are not paying taxes in any country, has created confusion among the migrant workforce particularly in Gulf countries. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has proposed in the Union Budget 2020 that NRIs not paying taxes in any foreign country will be deemed as resident Indians for purpose of income tax. Any income they earn from April 1 will be taxable in India if the NRIs do not pay tax in the foreign country.

While NRIs working in the US and Europe pay taxes there, those in the Gulf countries are not taxed. They are also not taxed in India due to their NRI status. The confusion arose as the Indian government has proposed to tax people, who simply globetrot for a specified number of days to claim NRI status, only to avoid paying taxes in India. Many employees in the Gulf are confused whether the provision is only for businessmen, who travel abroad for NRI status, or genuine workers are also covered by it.

Reports from the UAE and other Gulf countries point out that many NRI employees are confused over the new provision. While some tax experts say they will be taxed, others say no. Advocate and tax expert HP Ranina clarifies that Indians holding resident visa (permit) in the UAE need not pay tax in India as India and UAE have entered into Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement. However, Indians, who are not resident of any country but stay out for more than 240 days (183 days under existing rules, 240 days from April 1, 2020) only for the sake of NRI status should pay tax in India.

Tax consultant A Mehta feels that the new proposal in the Budget has dented the confidence of NRIs and it would hit NRI investment in India.

Senior auditor and tax consultant, Naveen Sharma, said under the new legislation an Indian should stay out of the country for 240 days to claim NRI status. If an Indian businessman settled in Gulf returns to India and stays there for less than 120 days, he will lose NRI status and thus he is liable to pay tax in India on his global income.

Madurai: Two days after the results of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Post Graduate (Neet PG) exams were declared, major medical entrance coaching centres in the city said that though the performance of candidates from Tamil Nadu was satisfactory with quite a few securing top ranks in the All India Rankings, the results were not good as last year’s results.

“We are yet to sort out the complete results and confirm our toppers. Tamil Nadu has got the maximum pass percentage at 55 per cent. However, when it comes to top ranks, the number of top ranks from Tamil Nadu in the top 1000, which is usually around 200 is sadly less than 100 this time around,” said Dr Arun Kumar, co-ordinator of a Neet PG coaching centre. A few students from Madurai Medical College have secured top 1000 ranks this year.

The co-ordinator of another Neet PG coaching centre, Tamil Selvam, said that many students from Madurai and Tamil Nadu have scored between 600-900 marks. “A score above 650 is likely to guarantee that students get admission in colleges within Tamil Nadu itself,” he said. The cut-off scores for this year for General Category, SC/ST/OBC, and UR-PWD are 366, 319 and 342 respectively.

Two of the most prominent Harappan sites in India – Dholavira and Lothal – featured prominently in Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget speech on Saturday.Dholavira in Kutch district is going to be developed as one of the five ‘iconic sites’ identified by the Union ministry of culture. The ongoing project of national maritime museum at Lothal in Ahmedabad district was also mentioned. The total budgetary allocation for the Union ministry of culture for 2020-21 is Rs 3,150 crore.Sitharaman said that the five archaeological sites including Rakhigarhi (Haryana), Hastinapur (Uttar Pradesh), Shivsagar ( Assam ), Dholavira (Gujarat) and Adichanallur (Tamil Nadu) will be developed as iconic sites with on-site museums.Dr Y S Rawat, former director of the state archaeology department and an archaeologist who worked on the Dholavira excavation, termed the move as a major impetus for development of the historic site.“The site witnesses major footfalls of international tourists today – especially in winter months. The proposed museum will add value to that experience. Hopefully, the status will not only be motivated by tourism, but also towards encouraging more research and interpretation of the site,” he said.The site, having the oldest excavated artefacts dating back to 5,491 years Before Present (BP) or 3,471 years before common era (BCE), consists of a fully-developed Harappan-era metropolis complete with castle, bailey, middle and lower towns and reservoirs. A recent paper by multi-disciplinary researchers claimed that Dholavira was an example of how climate change affected the human habitation in the past.Lothal, on the other hand, is significant for the find of the dockyard, considered to be one of the oldest in the world. It dates back to 5,720 years before present (BP) or 3,700 years before common era (BCE). Prime Minister Narendra Modi had performed the ground-breaking ceremony for the national maritime museum, being set up jointly by the Union ministry of culture and ministry of shipping and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), in March 2019.Sources close to the development said that the thematic museum aims at highlighting India’s links with other parts of the known world in ancient times, the country’s trade links and how it shaped today’s India, the maritime milestones and regional achievements.“While deliberations are still going on under leadership of the Sagarmala project of the central government, Prof Vasant Shinde, vice-chancellor of the Deccan College, Post Graduate and Research Institute has been roped in to oversee the development,” said an official close to the development. “A space has been procured at GIFT City to give final shape to the drafts, artefacts and designs.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73862471,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-711350,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/harappan-sites-get-budget-boost/articleshow/73855372.cms
194,['2/02/2020'],Union Budget 2020: AMT exemption to boost investment in dairy sector,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Representative image

Proposed reduction of tax on cooperative societies to 22% plus surcharge and cess as well as exemption from Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) will help increase investments in dairy sector. The relief to cooperatives has come at a time when milk processing capacity is being doubled in the country.

The cooperative sector proposals will also lead to more creation of jobs and remunerative prices to farmers.

Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation , India’s largest cooperative that markets Amul brand, along with its 18 district level milk unions will be able to save Rs 15 crore on account of the reduction in tax and AMT exemption.

Cooperatives had demanded level playing field by seeking lower tax on the lines of reduced corporate tax offered to companies. “This discrepancy has been eliminated. Farmers will now try to earn more profits from animal husbandry,” said R S Sodhi, managing director, GCMMF.

Gujarat’s dairy cooperatives have 36 lakh farmers as their members and they are currently paying nearly Rs 150 crore as taxes. Both GCMMF and the National Dairy Development Board ( NDDB ) had demanded reduction in tax ahead of the budget.

The target to double milk processing capacity from 53.5 million tonnes (MT) to 108 MT by 2025 will create 96 lakh new jobs in rural and urban India, said industry players.

“With addition of each one lakh litre milk processing capacity in the organised sector, 6,000 new jobs including 5,000 in rural India and 1,000 in urban India get created,” he said.

The dairy economy suffers a loss of around Rs 20,000 crore per year due to foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) alone directly affecting livelihood of farmers.

“Eradicating FMD and brucellosis in the country by 2025 would require effective implementation for the benefit of millions of small and marginal dairy farmers. The effective implementation includes manufacturing and sourcing of quality vaccines, robust testing methods and facilities, introduction of robust systems and processes and training of personal at all levels,” said NDDB’s chairman Dilip Rath.

“Eradication of FMD and brucellosis will help us overcome the technical barrier of trade agreements for export of milk and milk products and also follow the codex guidelines on quality and safety,” he said.

Slug: M’nagar riots

Muzaffarnagar: For the first time ever since 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, all 10 accused in a case pertaining to incitement of masses reached the court for a hearing. But more than six years and dozens of hearings later, the charges could not be framed as the judge was on leave.

According to lawyers, it is imperative for all accused to be present in the court at the time of the framing of charges. The 10 accused include two former MPs and as many MLAs. The incident pertains to August 30, 2013, in which these leaders delivered provocative speeches in Muslim-dominated Khalapar locality of Muzaffarnagar. The leaders included former MP from BSP Kadir Rana, the then MLAs Noor Saleem Rana, Maulana Jameel, among others.

Notably, another case has met a similar fate in which 13 accused have not appeared before the court, and hence, no charges have been framed. The accused in this particular case include the likes of Union minister and MP from Muzaffarnagar Sanjeev Balyan, UP sugarcane minister Suresh Rana among others.

It should be noted that on January 16, the court had ordered all 10 accused to appear before the court on January 27, but some of them could not reach there on the date. The court again fixed January 31 as the next date for their appearance.

However, as the judge was not present, they were instructed to appear in the court on February 25, said sources.

Defence lawyer Nakli Tyagi said, “Due to the judge being on leave, the court has fixed February 25 as the next date to frame charges.”

Notably, the Allahabad high court had directed shifting back the trial of the cases of political personalities, including cases related to Muzaffarnagar riots, to sessions court five months ago.

This came after, a special court had been formed in Allahabad in November 2018 to take over around three dozen cases against politicians in Muzaffarnagar for their speedy disposal. Leaders from various political parties, like UP minister Suresh Rana, BJP MLA Umesh Malik, BJP MLA Kapil Dev Aggarwal, Union minister Sanjeev Balyan, BJP MP Kunwar Bhartendra, former BSP MP Kadir Rana, former BSP MLA Noor Saleem Rana, were booked for making inflammatory speeches in 2013, which led to the 2013 riots, which resulted in deaths of 60 and displacement of over 50,000.

Vijayawada: The mystery behind the murder of 55-year-old woman in Bhavanipuram deepens, with the police finding that the cash and jewellery at the murdered woman’s house was left untouched, on Saturday. Not just that, the victim Yedupati Padmavathi’s earrings too were found untouched at the crime scene.

Police sources said that while they have gathered the necessary clues regarding the case, the motive remains a mystery as physical evidence in the crime scene does not suggest that it is a clear-cut case of murder for gain. “We are looking into every angle, including that the culprits could have been known to the victim’s family,” a Bhavanipuram police official said.

The gold ornaments that were robbed are said to be worth Rs 5 lakh, overall, while other untouched valuables were worth more. Preliminary post-mortem report indicates that the murder might have happened between 2pm to 4pm, while the incident came to light only at 7pm when the victim’s husband Venkateswara Rao found her in a pool of blood in her bedroom.

The police also found a glove on the spot and suspect that chilli powder was used. These clues lead them to believe that the perpetrator could be a ‘professional’.

Though Rao informed the cops—who reached the spot with clues team—but enough time had passed for the culprits to have fled the city.

Cops also suspect that the accused could be from a different state.

The entire incident happened at the victim’s residence in Crombwe Road area, under Bhavanipuram police station limits in the city.

Hyderabad: While South Central Railway ( SCR ) officials are optimistic about the proposed Mumbai-Pune-Hyderabad high-speed corridor, workers unions are worried that privatisation of rail networks will lead to increased fares.

With the Union Budget 2020 proposing high-speed train projects across the country, SCR officials said that Mumbai-Pune-Hyderabad high-speed route — one of the six sections for high-speed corridors identified by Indian Railways — will reduce running time by almost 50%. “The 747km distance between Mumbai-Hyderabad is currently covered by Hussainsagar Express in 17 hours and 10 minutes. The bullet rail corridor project can help optimise the high-speed rail connectivity between the two major citie,” said officials.

The IR is also mulling handing over operations of more trains to private players.

Railway union members in SCR zone are, however, unhappy with the expected privatisation. “Privatisation of trains will lead to increased fares for common people. Rather than improving train facilities, authorities should focus on running trains on-time,” said senior member, South Central Railway Mazdoor Union. “If trains will now be owned by private organisations, how will passengers who take these daily be able to afford them?”

Ahmedabad: Gujarat, which handles about a third of the country’s sea cargo, has begun taking precautions to combat the deadly novel coronavirus (CoV) outbreak in China that has spread to a few other countries.

The Gujarat Maritime Board, the state’s maritime regulator, has put in placing screening, detection and quarantine systems at all minor ports for disembarking seafarers or passengers and regular reporting using thermal scanner screening, said sources.

“As Kandla and the state’s minor ports receive many ships, crews and passengers from China, Hong Kong and Singapore, the health ministry has asked that all points of entry, including ports and airports, be on alert to prevent the virus contagion in India,” sources added. The secretary of the shipping ministry met senior officers of all state governments and state maritime boards on Thursday, to review measures taken by ports.

GMB chief nautical officer Capt A B Solanki told TOI over the phone that the Kandla Port Health Organization (PHO) has issued an advisory to all stakeholders, including pilots, customs and immigration officials and ship masters, demanding strict compliance. No vessel will be allowed without clearance from the PHO, he added.

The advisory deals with pre-arrival screening, grant of ‘pratique’, and suspected crew management, among others. “All GMB port offices have been instructed to procure 200 N-95 masks and thermal portable scanners for screening of coronavirus,” Solanki said.

HYDERABAD: Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao has called the Union Budget 2020 ‘totally disappointing’. He said that Telangana would be adversely affected by major cuts in budgetary allocations and charged the central government of discrimination.“It is sheer incompetence of the Centre to decrease the ratio of the state in Central funds. Normally, funds are given to the states according to the Budget proposals. Reducing the funds by 18.9% in 2019-20 clearly demonstrated the Centre’s faulty fiscal management. This has adversely impacted Telangana,” he said.“It is atrocious that the Centre has reduced the ratio of the state in the central taxes. There is a danger of having a fund scarcity for several welfare schemes and development programmes being implemented in the state,” he said. The CM held a four-hour long discussion with officials at Pragati Bhavan on the Budget proposals and its impact on the state.He was also upset over the Budget not providing funds for the state’s projects like Mission Bhagiratha and Mission Kakatiya. Niti Ayog had recommended Rs 24,000 crore for them.“The Centre is committing a fraud and cheating on the GST front. The Centre has not given any clarity on these (compensation) funds in the Budget,” he said. Among his main grouses was the Centre accepting the 15th Finance Commission ’s proposal, reducing the state’s share of funds from 42% to 41%. Earlier, Telangana was given 2.437% of share and this financial year it was reduced to 2.133%. “With this, there will be direct decrease of Rs 2,381 crore of funds from the Centre.”He said the Centre, which had cut Rs 3,731 crore funds from the share it had announced in Parliament in 2019-20 financial year, is now proposing Rs 16,726 crore in 2020-21. “There is no link between what the Centre is promising to the states and what it actually is releasing.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73860432,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1055564,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-share-in-central-funds-slashed-cm/articleshow/73855357.cms
201,['2/02/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Prison department warns of action against corrupt officials,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Representative image

CHENNAI: Corrupt practices of prison department personnel, which range from forcing relatives of inmates to buy groceries for families of the personnel to colluding with gangsters for monetary benefits, have been taken into account by the prison department headquarters that sent out a circular cautioning erring officials of stern action.

Deputy inspector general of prisons (headquarters) K Kanagaraj on January 31 sent a circular to all the heads of the central prisons for men and women, district jails and borstal schools listing out the “widespread and deep-rooted corrupt” practices involving everyone from superintendents to jail wardens.

Though the circular did not name anyone, it hints at a second-grade warden who had illicit relationships with wives of several inmates. The circular that highlighted 15 points stated that a few jailors, superintendents and wardens have been taking bribe and extending facilities to inmates against the prison manual. The four-page circular also revealed that some officials were also colluding with rowdy elements and gangsters and acting against the law” for personal gain. “The circular has been sent after the department received reports from police department from various districts,” said a senior official in the headquarters. He, however, said no department enquiry has been ordered yet.

Additional director general of police (prisons) Abhash Kumar told TOI that departmental action had been taken against seven personnel for indulging in corrupt practices four months ago. “The circular is to warn others and dissuade them from indulging in such practices,” he said.

Though the inmates are eligible for ordinary or emergency leave as per the prison manuals, some officials are granting it only after taking bribes. Casteism is also being practised by a few wardens. TOI had earlier reported the ill practices, highlighting caste discrimination within the central prisons in Palayamkottai and the practice of taking bribes from convicts to grant eligible leave.

Demanding bribe to release inmates despite court orders, allowing inmates to use mobile phones and facilitating a comfortable stay for gangsters for money were some of the other issues highlighted in the circular. It also pointed out that a doctor working in the prison hospital had been smuggling out medicine to his private clinic.

202,['2/02/2020'],‘Gujarat Model’ to be replicated?,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday proposed the formation of a ‘National Police University’ and a ‘National Forensic Science University’ in her budget speech.

While the fine print is yet to be made public, experts say the proposed universities may be formed on the existing models of Raksha Shakti University (RSU) and Gujarat Forensic Sciences University (GFSU) in Gandhinagar.

“Both universities — RSU, founded in 2009, and GFSU, in 2011 — were established by the then CM Narendra Modi to provide security forces a formal educational platform, to improve their investigation and security management skills,” said a Gandhinagar-based educationist. “After a decade, these universities are still developing to realize their full potential. While GFSU is now training officials of 20-odd countries in Asia and Africa, RSU is primarily attracting those aspiring to Gujarat Police jobs.”

The two universities may provide a template in terms of course designs and industry requirements, with the FM outlining forensic science, policing science and cyber forensics as domain areas for the proposed universities. “There was talk of giving GFSU national status and making it a nodal centre. Thus, at the moment it’s not clear whether there will be a new university or if GFSU would be upgraded,” said an official close to the development.

Likewise, the public private partnership (PPP) model of attaching a medical college to existing district hospitals — the basis of several Gujarat Medical Education and Research Society (GMERS) medical colleges — has also found mention in the budget. The FM said that to meet requirements for qualified doctors, hospitals and medical college facilities would be provided land at concessional rates and they would also receive viability gap funding.

TIRUPATI: A sea of devotees thronged the abode of Lord Venkateswara as the 175 galleries around the four mada streets encircling the hill temple were jam-packed all through the day at Tirumala on Radhasapthami on Saturday.

Lord Balaji blessed the devout who assembled for seven different processions in a day. The series of processions began with the Surya Prabha Vahanam, as Lord Malayappa Swamy stepped out of the Vahana Mandapam at 5.30 am on Saturday. Then it was the turn of Lord Garuda—the celestial carrier of Lord Sri Maha Vishnu—to carry Lord Venkateswara, in a colourful procession around the main temple complex. In the afternoon, Lord Venkateswara bestowed his grace in the guise of Lord Rama during the Hanumantha Vahanam procession held at 1 pm. The ‘Chakrasnanam’ fete was held in the sacred waters of the Srivari temple tank as the temple priests dipped ‘Chakrathalwar’ in the waters at 2 pm.

In the evening, Lord Malayappa Swamy took a pleasure ride on the ‘Kalpavruksha’ vahanam (Tree of boons).

Sources in TTD told TOI the land in Ulundurpet belongs to private individuals, including AIADMK MLA R Kumaraguru. “Four people, including the MLA, who is also a member of TTD board, have donated the land and in the coming days it will be registered in the name of TTD. Once the land is registered, TTD board that is meeting at the end of this month will decide about the type of temple. After that we will know the total cost of construction,” said TTD local advisory committee chief Sekar Reddy.

Meanwhile, Palaniswami is said to have promised to provide five acres in OMR for construction of a new TTD temple. “Along with Ulundurpet, a new temple will also come up at Old Mahabalipuram Road. Here too we have been promised five acres,” said Reddy. The plot on OMR near Sholinganallur is a government land. “The OMR land transfer will be between Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu governments. This too will be discussed in the TTD board meeting and a decision taken,” said Reddy. TTD board chief Y V Subba Reddy visited the plot on OMR.

Earlier there were proposals to use a HR&CE temple land at Tiruvadandai on East Coast Road. “But as the land is far from Chennai city, the AP government had requested a land closer to the city so that it would be easily accessible to devotees,” said a TTD LAC member.

PUNE: Ind-SAT for Asian and African students to award scholarships to study in India will bring in quality students, said heads of educational institutions in Pune.

The challenge will be its large-scale implementation, though, especially in countries where internet connectivity is poor. Currently, there is no standard examination for foreign students arriving in India to study.

Vidya Yeravdekar, principal director of Symbiosis Society that runs the Symbiosis International University, told TOI they had 75 scholarship students in India programme last year and 45 this year. “If it is an online test, bandwidth will be a problem in many African countries. But the test will help students take India seriously. It will also create a level playing field for students from different countries. At present, we rely on marks obtained by them in their country,” said Yeravdekar. There are about 3,000 students studying in various courses in the university.

Meanwhile, with the central government allowing top 100 institutions in the country to offer online degree programmes, educationists said the move is likely to improve the enrolment ratio.

Another positive move, they said, is allowing urban bodies to provide one-year internship to engineers. The move will help engineering students, as AICTE had made internships compulsory two years ago.

HYDERABAD: The thrust on agriculture, education and healthcare, had Telangana Inc terming the Budget as positive, aspirational and balanced. The industry captains also lauded various initiatives of the FM to put more money in the hands of common people by lowering taxation rates to boost consumption in the economy. However, those hoping for bold moves to kick-start the economic engine were left high and dry.

FICCI president Sangita Reddy said: “Given the constraints, this has been a comprehensive statement. By invoking the deviation clause in FRBM Act and relaxing the fiscal deficit to 3.8% in the current year and targeting 3.5% in the next year, the government has underscored its resolve to support the economy at a time when it needs a fiscal boost.” She said this was FICCI’s key suggestion to the government and through this it expects more money in the hands of the people that will spur consumption and industrial growth. “Much of this money will go towards capital expenditure in infrastructure and agriculture sector — two areas that can have the maximum growth enhancing impact,” she added.

Terming the Budget as balanced, Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) president, Karunendra S Jasti, said increasing turnover limit from Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crore for compulsory audit, abolition of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) for companies, bringing smaller NBFCs under SARFAESI Act, and reducing the loan size from Rs 1 crore to Rs 50 lakh for applicability of SARFAESI Act, extension of debt restructuring facility for MSMEs till March 2021 and extension of tax holiday for developers of affordable housing by one year, are steps in right direction.

However, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories chairman, Satish Reddy, felt the high expectations of the industry were dashed as the Budget was devoid of any bold reforms given the state of the economy. “I would have liked to see a significant financial incentive to boost exports and improve the competitiveness of the pharma sector. I hope this will take shape with a new export incentive scheme,” he said.

Reddy praised the expansion of Ayushman Bharat programme by setting up additional hospitals in Tier 2 and 3 cities.

BENGALURU: Sellers on e-marketplaces may face liquidity squeeze as the government has introduced a new withholding tax on e-commerce transactions. Essentially, companies like Amazon India and Flipkart will withhold an additional 1% tax-deduction-at-source (TDS) while making payments to merchants who sell goods on their platforms . This would be in addition to the GST tax deduction that e-tailers charge online sellers.

While this would not impact consumers in terms of final pricing of products on e-commerce platforms immediately, the new 1% TDS would make sellers work around their working capital arrangements—to buy or source goods to sell online. “The tax at 1% is required to be deducted on the gross amount of such sales or service or both,” says the finance bill. It is not clear if these norms are expected to impact restaurants on online food delivery platforms like Zomato and Swiggy and service professionals on platforms like Urban Company (till recently UrbanClap).

This will not be applicable to those with an annual gross sale of less than Rs 5 lakh, provide their furnish their PAN or Aadhaar to the e-commerce operator. For those over gross sales of over Rs 5 lakh, this TDS would be deducted at 5% if they do not furnish their PAN or Aadhaar number.

“Working capital will be affected due to this. We had supported 1% tax collection under GST despite marketplace opposition and we had recommended application of 1% TDS under the Income Tax Act as inserted today as section 194-O. However, we had also sought relaxation from the technical application of section 194H due to which we have to deduct TDS on marketplace services and claim back from marketplaces. The new provision would be welcome only with the relaxation of existing provisions,” said a spokesperson of All India Online Vendors Association , which represents a group of small online sellers.

While an Amazon India spokesperson said that they are studying the matter, Flipkart declined to comment at the time of going to press.

214,['2/02/2020'],FM gives mini doses of joy to biotech players,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Hyderabad: The biotech sector had reason to cheer as the Budget had direct and indirect boosters. Be it the thrust on animal vaccines or mapping country’s genetic landscape to encourage discovery of next-generation medicines or even IPR protection and cold chain supply infrastructure, FM injected the right doses.

Biocon CMD Kiran Mazumdar Shaw said, “The announcements related to building a genetic database for drug innovation and investing in quantum computing for advancing our analytical capabilities are critical components for leveraging technology to gain a competitive edge. The measures can give returns in the medium to long-term but we need to ensure they are implemented fast.”

Bharat Biotech CMD Krishna Ella said the big push comes from the thrust on five vaccines – including Foot and Mouth Disease, brucellosis and PPR (goat plague) eradication. The focus on cold chain infrastructure development, which plays a crucial role in ensuring efficacy of vaccines, will also have a positive impact, he said.

Lauding the announcement of two national-level science schemes to create a comprehensive database, Mapmygenome CEO Anu Acharya said that this will lead to availability of quality data for healthcare players and open doors for collaborations and innovation.

Indian Immunologicals Limited deputy MD Prasanna Deshpande said that the proposal to expand the coverage of artificial insemination to 70% from 30% will also assist in increasing livestock productivity and benefit farmers.

However, Ram Kaundinya, director general, Federation of Seed Industry of India (FSII), rued the lack of structural reforms in agri-biotech sector. “While the FM said that they wanted to make the Indian farmer competitive, she did not talk about using modern science and technology in seeds...”

Kaundinya also expressed scepticism about the government’s emphasis on Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) stating that it cannot take our farmers towards global competitiveness and financial security.

Artistes and various organisations from across the country took part in the protest at Jantar Mantar.

NEW DELHI: It was an all-out “art attack” on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) at Jantar Mantar on Saturday. With songs, poems and street plays , artistes raised their voice against CAA and NRC as part of the protest titled “We the people to protect the Constitution.” One of the plays was based on the idea of secular India.

“Artistes have the power to change views and we are here to protect the Constitution,” said one of the protesters. Theatre groups, poets and several other artistes and organisations from across the country took part in the protest. They included Kerala-based Janasmriti, Jana Natya Manch, All Indian Lawyers Union, Delhi Science Forum and Dastak from Delhi University.

Poet and lyricist Hussain Haidry, who recited his poem “Hindustani Musalman,” said that it was necessary for the artistes to speak up. “Art involves image and sound, which can strike a chord with the public,” added Haidry, who is known for his protest poems.

On the importance of protests, the poet said: “Artistes have the capacity to create a counter-narrative against the wrong ideas. They have the power to use sound and visuals to bring about a change. Artists are always the first to be attacked because they have the power to counter.”

Srinivas, member of Janasmriti, said that his group decided to join the protest “as the new laws were against the Constitutional values.” Members of the group sang in chorus about “the need to protect the life for the next generation.”

JAIPUR: After chief minister Ashok Gehlot 's letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , the Centre on Saturday released Rs 682 crore for the payment of wages to MGNREGA workers.

Earlier, in the last week of January, the Centre had released Rs 195 crore for payment of wages to MGNREGA workers up to November 5.

However, the Centre has not released funds amounting to Rs 1,026 crore for material component yet. The payment of wages to the workers was due since October 2, 2019.

Gehlot had written to the PM requesting him to release funds under NREGA for the payment of wages and material component. The chief minister had pointed out that the due wages of workers have gone up to Rs 848 crore and Rs 1,026 crore was due on account of material component.

“We have received Rs 195 crore on January 22 for payment of wages to workers up to November 5. The remaining due amount, around Rs 700 crore, will also be released in a couple of days,” said state's MGNREGA commissioner P C Kishan.

218,['2/02/2020'],More gloom than cheer for AP in Budget,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Vijayawada: The Union Budget presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament on Saturday has triggered a political war in the state between the ruling YSR Congress ( YSRC ) and the opposition Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ). While both parties accused the Centre of meting out a raw deal to the state, both parties also accused the other of allowing this to happen.

Former state finance minister and TDP MLC Yanamala Ramakrishnudu blamed the YSRC for the non-allocation of grants to Andhra Pradesh in the Budget. The state government, Yanamala said, has failed on all fronts to ensure budgetary allocations from the central government, and said the state’s policies were to blame for the Centre’s inaction.

Holding chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy responsible for the failure to secure grants, Yanamala said, “In his first meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Jaganmohan Reddy said that we do not need funds for the capital city. When the state government has asked the Centre to not give funds, why would the Union government allocate funds to the state?”

Yanamala also took note of the YSRC-led government’s decision to cancel Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), stating that it affected investor sentiment in the state. The chief minister went ahead with the decision even after the Union government warned against the cancellation of PPAs, the embassies of five nations expressed concern and the high court issued a stay order, Yanamala said, adding that the move dented the image of the state.

Investments worth nearly Rs 1 lakh crore have been withdrawn from the state in the last eight months said Yanamala, a result of the state government’s decision to cancel PPAs, stop work on the Polavaram project and the proposal to set up three capital cities. The chief minister should also give an explanation to the people of Andhra Pradesh for claiming to bring in funds and special category status to the state, and then for failing to achieve this, the former minister said.

The demand for special category status has been long-pending in the state and was promised by the former UPA government at the Centre at the time of bifurcation of the state.

Hitting back at Yanamala, finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy said that corruption and mismanagement by the former TDP-led government had placed the state in poor condition, with pending debts amounting to Rs 60,000 crore. Responding to the charge that the YSRC was responsible for the non-allocation of grants to AP in the Union Budget, Rajendranath blamed the TDP for failing to bring pressure on the Union in 2014 in the matter of special category status.

Stating that the TDP compromised the interests of the state for personal and political benefit while in power, Rajendranath said, “They do not have any moral authority to blame the YSRC government, which has only been in power for eight months. Had the TDP acted in the last five years and brought pressure on the Union government for implementation of the promises made during the time of bifurcation of the state, we would not have to start over again.” The TDP, Rajendranath said, compromised on the issue of special category status and accepted a special package instead.

Rajendranath also justified the review of Power Purchase Agreements taken up after the YSRC-led government came to power last year. The government reviewed 41 PPAs in wind power that were entered into without exploring cheaper alternatives and negotiating prices.

Hyderabad: Cantonment boards across the country now have an uphill task on the financial front following an allocation of around Rs 382 crore in the 2020-21 Budget for Defence Estates Organisation, a sharp drop from the revised outlay of Rs 497.15 crore in the previous fiscal. The decision attracted sharp criticism from officials of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) who said the reduction in funds will adversely impact many ongoing projects.

“The budget has been very disappointing. For the past few years, the government has been consistently reducing its allocation for cantonments. This has halted multiple development works in the SCB,” said J Rama Krishna, vice-president of the board. He said: “Earlier, the SCB was a self-sustaining entity. But, now we have to depend heavily on direct government.”

Repairing of roads and the underground drainage system might get stopped, they said. “The water board is willing to increase the supply, but we do not have the infrastructure to receive it. We have been meaning to address this, but the future of that project now hangs in balance,” said another senior board member, P Venkat Rao.

JAIPUR: Four persons including a 39-year-old Chinese woman, who had reportedly travelled in the same flight with a person who tested positive for novel coronavirus (nCoV) in Kerala, were quarantined at Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital here on Saturday.

The Chinese woman’s friend, who hails from Bharatpur, is among those who have been quarantined in the hospital. Both of them were brought to the city by the health department from Udaipur on Saturday. The Chinese woman, who hails from Nanjing, came to India on January 23 with her friend. Her travel history showed she did not visit Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak.

“We have taken samples of them and sent them to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for nCoV test,” Dr DS Meena, SMS Hospital superintendent, said.

A health department official said the Chinese woman’s friend, a 30-year-old man from Bharatpur, had gone to the neighbouring country to learn Mandarin on September 6, 2019 and returned to India on January 23. The Chinese woman accompanied him to India.

The other two admitted to SMS Hospital are a 27-year-old man from Jaipur who recently returned to India from China and was found suffering from symptoms of fever, cough and body ache. The fourth person, also from here, was found suffering from fever, cough, sore throat and breathlessness after he visited Guangzhou and nearby places from January 14 to 22.

Two persons, who were admitted to the hospital earlier with fever, cough and body ache, were discharged after NIV Pune’s report showed that they tested negative for the disease.

Three persons quarantined in Bikaner’s government medical college have also tested negative. The doctors discharged them from the hospital.

Currently, 30 people in the state are under the watch of the health department officials for suspected Corona virus infection. All of them returned from China recently and the health department is monitoring them as a precautionary measure.

The screening of patients at Jaipur airport for nCoV continued on Saturday. “The passengers travelling by international flights have been screened for the disease. So far 2,842 passengers of 19 flights have been screened for nCoV,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (health), health department.

Vijayawada: Industry bodies in the state have expressed unhappiness over the Budget for ignoring AP’s interests. They, however, feel the tax cuts proposed by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman may help in reviving the economy to some extent.

“It’s a balanced Budget, which clearly gives impetus to MSMEs and start-ups. Though the fine print is yet to be scrutinised, the reduced income tax rates may stimulate consumption,” Vijay Naidu Galla, chairman of CII-AP, said. Galla also welcomed the proposal to scrap dividend distribution tax, and Sitharaman’s focus on the need to honour contracts signed by the government. “The plan to set up a clearance cell to fast-track investment proposals is a positive step. The Centre’s plan to set up five new smart cities is also a welcome move. The Budget is good on many counts, but it is disappointing that there is nothing in it for the state,” he added.

D Rama Krishna, vice-chairman of CII-AP, said the Centre’s thrust on skills development and the plan to offer internship opportunities to engineers to work on municipal construction projects would help them get an idea of how the government works.

JSRK Prasad, a former chairman of CII-AP, praised the Budget’s focus to double farm income by 2022. According to P Ravi Kiran, chairman of CII’s Vijayawada zone, the removal of dividend distribution tax would encourage big companies to invest in the country.

“We were expecting some major reforms given that the economy has slowed down markedly, inflation has risen and jobs have disappeared instead of being created. The Budget is a disappointment because it has prescribed some cosmetic changes here and there without addressing the structural changes required to revive economic growth engines like real estate, manufacturing and mining,” said Potluri Bhaskara Rao, general secretary of AP Chambers of Commerce & Industry Federation.

“The finance minister has tweaked the income tax rates, and increased the slabs to six from the earlier three. I think the new slabs will only confuse taxpayers more. More importantly, however, it is disappointing that the finance minister did not announce any new spending for AP, which needs industrial investment following its bifurcation in June 2014,” Bhaskara Rao added.

Hyderabad: Upset with the Centre over poor allocation for education, academics from the city said the money earmarked for the sector is too little given the move to introduce the New Education Policy (NEP). The Rs 99,300 crore,they said, will barely be enough to implement central government schemes like Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, mid-day meals, information & communication technology at schools among others.

“Last year, the budget for education was increased by Rs 10,000 crore when compared with 2018-19. This year, it has been increased by just Rs 4,446 crore. Leave alone allocating 10% of the budget to education, as suggested by the Kothari Commission in the 1960s, the Centre has given education even less than what it offered last year,” said Chava Ravi, a teacher. Without funds, experts said, implementing NEP would not yield any results in school education.

Academics at prestigious institutes in the state, however, said allowing foreign investments would improve the quality of education. “The private universities can generate money by increasing the intake of foreign students. Now that the Centre has decided to introduce Indo-SAT examination, entrance test for foreign students, especially from Asia and Africa, planning to study in India, only meritorious students will be allowed into the country, which in turn will improve the rating of our institutes,” National Institute of Technology, Warangal, director N V Ramana Rao said.

On internships for engineering students, the academics said it might not have any significant impact on overall employability. “Any company can offer only 5% of workforce as internships. So, offering internships will not have any significant impact,” said Ramesh Loganathan, professor, IIIT-H.

Though no positive cases of coronavirus infection have been seen in the city, chemists confirmed the spike in sale of masks.It may be recalled that the guidelines issued by the Centre, as a preventive measure, mention the usage of handkerchiefs or masks to maintain cough hygiene.

HYDERABAD: Greater flamingos, the much-awaited avian visitors that migrate to the city during winter, have given Osman Sagar a miss this year. This is the second consecutive year that the birds have given the lake a miss, which is a prime breeding site, leaving birdwatchers and photographers wondering about their migration pattern.

While the formal count will take some time, birdwatchers say that from about 500 birds that used to flock the lake a couple of years ago, the numbers have come down to less than 15 this year.

“There are hardly any flamingos. Usually, greater flamingos land up at the water bodies in this region around November and stay for nearly 4-5 months before flying back to Gujarat, where they come from. This year was disappointing,” said Hari Krishna Adepu of Hyderabad Birding Pals.

While birdwatchers and photographers have been visiting the lake every week since the beginning of the season in the hope to spot some birds, ornithologists have attributed the decline in number to factors such as increase in water levels, lack of food, pollution, climate change and habitat loss.

“There is no specific reason for the decline in the number of migratory birds in natural history. Reasons could vary from local poaching to quality of habitat and climate change. This year, the number of birds is less everywhere. The main reason for a decline in the number of flamingos is increase in water level and scarcity of food,” said Ananda Banerjee, an ornithologist.

When asked if climate change could have an impact on the decline, Banerjee said, “There is some disturbance due to climate change, but we are not in a position to pinpoint just one reason. From a scientific point of view, one must look at several factors including past data. There is never just one factor that can causes a decline.”

A member of CREDAI, which is the apex body of Private Real Estate Developers ’ Associations said, the union Budget 2020-21 will boost the affordable housing sector by extending the permitted additional deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh for interest paid on loans borrowed for the purchase of an affordable house valued up to Rs 45 lakh by one year, i.e. up to March 31, 2021. A CREDAI member said, “There are many ongoing affordable housing projects in Rajasthan . The total tax deduction available on such interest paid stays at Rs 3.5 lakh for one more year, which is expected to positively impact demand in the affordable housing segment.” Many believe this will also give a push to the middle class segment in the state capital as people can buy houses under this range and many new developing areas of the city.

228,['2/02/2020'],Startups get help to take quantum leap,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Jaipur: As an emerging hub for startups, Rajasthan’s entrepreneurs, early stage investors and the ecosystem players said the announcements in the Budget will lend a fillip to innovation and development of new-age technologies.

During her Budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said an eligible startup having turnover up to Rs 25 crore is currently allowed deduction of 100% of its profits for three consecutive assessment years out of seven years. “In order to extend this benefit to larger startups, I propose to increase the turnover limit from existing Rs 25 crore to Rs 100 crore,” she said.

She further said that considering the fact that in the initial years, a startup may not have adequate profit to avail this deduction, I propose to extend the period of eligibility for claim of deduction from the existing seven years to 10 years.

Similarly, she said ESOPs given by startups are taxable as perquisites at the time of exercise. “This leads to cash-flow problem for the employees who do not sell the shares immediately and continue to hold the same for the long-term. In order to give a boost to the startup ecosystem, I propose to ease the burden of taxation on the employees by deferring the tax payment by five years or till they leave the company or when they sell their shares, whichever is earliest.”

Mahavir Sharma, chairman of TiE Global, said that the announcements are expected to deepen the startup ecosystem. “ESOPs will help startups attract talent. At an early stage, these ventures need good talent to do research and development for finding breakthrough technologies. ESOP is a significant component of compensation for these employees and they should not come with strings attached. The Budget proposals have come in right time.”

Quantum technology is opening up new frontiers in computing, communications, cyber security with wide-spread applications. It is expected that lots of commercial applications would emerge from theoretical constructs which are developing in this area.

To harness the potential, the finance minister proposed to provide an outlay of Rs 8,000 crore over a period five years for the National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications.

Sharma said, “Technology is the future and will drive global economy. To remain ahead of the curve, we need to develop new technologies. In that sense, the outlay of Rs 8,000 crore is very apt.”

Solar pumps have emerged as a key tool for the government to achieve its ambition of doubling farmers’ income ... Read More

JAIPUR: Solar pumps have emerged as a key tool for the government to achieve its ambition of doubling farmers ’ income by 2022. Rajasthan is one of the few states to have taken a lead in popularizing solar pumps at a mass scale in rural areas and the Budget announcement is likely to add further impetus.

In the Budget speech, the finance minister said the PM-Kusum scheme removed farmers’ dependence on diesel and kerosene and linked pump sets to solar energy.

“Now, I propose to expand the scheme to provide 20 lakh farmers for setting up stand-alone solar pumps; further we shall also help another 15 lakh farmers solarise their grid-connected pump sets,” she said in her speech.

In addition, the government also proposed a scheme to enable farmers to set up solar power generation capacity on their fallow or barren lands and to sell it to the grid, would be operationalized.

The Kusum scheme is implanted by the energy department in Rajasthan and has set a tariff of Rs 3.14 per unit at which the department will buy power from farmers or investors.

But the solar industry in the state said that the tariff is lucrative and the government needs to increase the rates to attract farmers or investors to the scheme.

Sunil Bansal, general secretary of Rajasthan Solar Association said, “To make the scheme a success, the rates need to be improved. Drawing parallel with tariffs for large projects with Kusum schemes is not logical. The maintenance cost for small projects is much higher than large projects. We expect the government to factor in the differences and set a rate accordingly. Because at Rs 3.14, the return on investment is not even 10%.”

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy , which is implementing the scheme nationally, also provides 40 paise as subsidy which means the cost of power to discoms comes to Rs 2.66 per unit.

The accident pertaining to the case took place on the early hours of August 3.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Two days after the government extended his suspension period, IAS officer Sriram Venkitaraman received another setback on Saturday with the crime branch submitting a chargesheet against him in the case pertaining to the death of journalist K M Basheer . The crime branch have charged Sriram with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, driving under the influence of alcohol, destruction of public property and destruction of evidence.

The crime branch has also arraigned Sriram’s friend Wafa Firoze as the second accused in the case, charging her with the offence of abetment of crime. Sriram was driving Wafa’s car with her on the passenger seat when he rammed Basheer’s motorcycle in front of Public Works office here, killing him instantly.

The chargesheet was filed by crime branch Superintendent A Shanavas before judicial first class magistrate - III here. The investigation officer has listed around 100 witnesses, 70 material objects and 80 documents as evidence.

The accident pertaining to the case took place on the early hours of August 3. The case is that Sriram, while returning from a party in an inebriated state, forcefully took the wheel from Wafa and drove the car at a high speed, eventually causing the accident. The accident occurred barely 200 meters away from Museum police station.

Sources in the investigation team said that Sriram was charged with the offence of drunk driving based on witness accounts, including people who stopped at the accident spot and the government doctor who noted the smell of alcohol when Sriram was taken to General Hospital soon after the accident. He got himself admitted to a private hospital in the city and refused to give blood sample for blood test, causing half-a-day’s delay in finally carrying out the procedure and the test result turned out negative.

The sections pertaining to destruction of evidence was invoked as the investigation team found out that there was a clear attempt from the part of Sriram to evade legal action, especially when Wafa turned up before the local police claiming that it was she who was driving the car. The sections under Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act was invoked as Sriram allegedly damaged the periphery wall of the Public Works office as well as a heritage lamp on the pavement of the road by crashing the car.

Recently, Sriram, who is under suspension due to pending inquiry, had requested the government to revoke his suspension citing the delay in completion of the investigation. However, the government rejected it and extended the suspension to three more months.

JAIPUR: As finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman , while presenting the Union Budget on Saturday, urged all the states and union territories to replace conventional energy meters with prepaid smart meters in the next three years, a senior government official termed it as an ambitious plan.

“The state has already started installing smart meters, but it appears to be an ambitious plan considering the shortage of manufacturing capacity in the country. It requires behavioural change among consumers to install prepaid meters,” said Peeyush Samariya , managing director, Rajasthan Urja Vikas Nigam Limited, Jaipur. Stating that installing smart meters in all households in the next three years is difficult, Samariya said, “Let us see...only if manufacturing and supply is available and if the Centre is ready to support us financially. But it is not possible to implement the project if the burden is solely on Discoms.” While presenting Budget, the FM said, taking electricity to every household has been a major achievement. However, the distribution sector is under financial stress.

JAIPUR: Despite having about a dozen world-renowned archaeological sites, none of them figured in the list of five announced by finance minister Nirmala Sithraman to develop iconic sites in the country.

During her Budget speech, Sitharaman named Rakhigarhi (Haryana), Hastinapur (Uttar Pradesh), Shivsagar (Assam), Dholavira (Gujarat) and Adichanallur (Tamil Nadu) which would be turned around as iconic sites with on-site museums.

Disappointed that none of the sites from Rajasthan like Kalibangan, a major provincial capital of the Indus Valley civilization, found the favour, people engaged in the tourism industry said that politics plays part in such decisions.

“When you don’t have your party running the government at the Centre, it is obvious that your state’s interests may not get the same weight,” said a tour operator.

The finance minister said that she expects the state governments to develop a roadmap for certain identified destinations and formulate financial plans during 2021 against which specified grants will be made available to the states in 2020-21.

But there are three proposals for developing three tourist circuits which have been submitted to the Union tourism ministry but till now, none of the projects have been sanctioned.

“Three plans for ecotourism, desert tourism and tribal tourism have been submitted to the Centre around two-and-a-half-year ago. Each proposal has estimated a budget of Rs 100 crore. But none has been sanctioned so far,” said an official at the state tourism department.

The finance minister said that for purpose of tourism promotion, she has proposed to allocate Rs 2,500 crore for 2020-21.

Visakhapatnam: Newly-founded state varsities, Central University of Andhra Pradesh and Central Tribal University of Andhra Pradesh, received a budgetary support of Rs 60 crore and Rs 27 crore respectively in the Union Budget 2020-21.

The Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy ( IIPE ), Visakhapatnam, established under the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, has been allocated Rs 32 crore.

Speaking to STOI, director of IIPE, Prof VSRK Prasad, said the allocation is low compared to the institute’s expectations. “However, we are hopeful of getting more funds in the revised budget proposals. We have so far got budgetary support of about Rs 95 crore. We are also trying to be a part of the ministry of human resource and development’s (MHRD) Higher Education Financing Agency ( HEFA ),” Prof Prasad said.

Other premier educational institutes in the state, such as Indian Institute of Technology-Tirupati, Indian Institute of Management-Visakhapatnam, National Institute of Technology-Tadepalligudem, Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research-Tirupati and Indian Institute of Information Technology-Sri City, drew a blank. These institutes are part of the MHRD’s HEFA, for which allocations in Saturday’s Budget were merged under the heads ‘support to Indian Institutes of Technology’ and ‘support to Indian Institutes of Management’.

Under HEFA, the institution can draw any amount from funds sanctioned to it upon submitting utilisation certificates. The agency is a joint venture between MHRD and Canara Bank and finances the creation of capital assets in premier educational institutions. It leverages funds from the market to finance infrastructure and supplements it with donations and CSR funds.

The Budget has also proposed introducing full-fledged online degree programmes to be offered only by institutions ranked below 100 in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF).

In her Budget speech, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said initially only a few institutions will offer online degree programmes. Andhra University, Vizag and Sri Venkateswara University, Tirupati will be eligible to offer online courses with NIRF ranks of 29 and 72, respectively, in 2019.

235,['2/02/2020'],NMC action against 40 illegal vegetable markets,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Nagpur: Following directives of mayor Sandip Joshi and municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) probably for the first time initiated action against 40 unauthorized vegetable markets. Around 2,500 vegetable and fruits vendors selling products outside designated market places were removed.

However, NMC teams returned without taking action from Chor Bazaar in front of Empress Mall and the weekly vegetable market at Mominpura.

NMC will continue the drive from Sunday morning as many unauthorized vegetable markets come up on the roads on Sundays.

Following the policy framed by Joshi for stringent action against encroachments on roads and footpaths, Mundhe on Friday directed NMC’s enforcement, market, health departments and zone offices to ensure no unauthorized vegetable markets and vendors remain on the roads. Accordingly, the drive was launched in all ten zones from 7am on Saturday.

NMC teams did not allow vegetable markets to be set up at many locations, including Gokulpeth, Kelibag Road, Pardi, Rameshwari, Gandhisagar Lake, Uday Nagar, Manewada etc.

Action was taken against vegetable and fruit vendors at Pratap Nagar Square, Mate Square, Trimurti Nagar, Jaitala, Gopal Nagar, Ashirwad Chowk, Manewada, Cotton Market, Ramna Maroti, Mhalgi Nagar, Kamal Chowk, Kabir Nagar, Taj Nagar, Char Khamba Square, Gittikhadan, Gorewada, Itarsi Puliya, Mahal Budhwaar Bazaar, Ayachit Mandir, Hiwri Nagar, Nikalas Mandir, Amardeep Talkies, Bagdiya Chowk, Teen Nal Chowk, Marwadi Chowk, Zade Chowk, HB Town, Jaripatka, Chhaoni, Katol Road, Mankapur, Bharat Chowk etc.

Joshi and Mundhe have taken the decision as unauthorized vegetable markets and vendors create congestion on roads and also cause unhygienic condition by dumping waste. Apart from encroachment on roads, vehicles coming to these markets and vendors also block a major chunk of roads.

Unfortunately, vendors at Chor Bazaar and weekly market at Mominpura Bakri Mandi protested the drive and managed to force NMC teams to return without taking any action.

NMC teams from enforcement department and Dhantoli zone sought police personnel for the drive at Chor Bazaar. Similarly, NMC enforcement department and Gandhibagh zone asked for police protection for action at Mominpura Bakri Mandi vegetable market. NMC officials said police personnel were not provided, forcing the teams to return. “NMC teams conducted the drive at other locations without police personnel. Police should cooperate with the drive as it is meant to ease traffic congestion and welfare of the city,” officials said.

NMC’s Nuisance Detection Squad also recovered penalty from vendors for creating unhygienic conditions.

236,['2/02/2020'],Big thrust on MSMEs to keep economy rolling,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Jaipur: Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises ( MSMEs ), the mainstay of Rajasthan’s industry, won the attention of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who made a slew of announcements for the sector in the Union Budget, saying they are vital to keep the wheels of economy moving.

Sitharaman said amendments to the Factor Regulation Act 2011 will be made to enable NBFCs to extend invoice financing to the MSMEs through TReDS, thereby enhancing their economic and financial sustainability.

Reacting to the announcement, former chairman of CII-Rajasthan Dillip Baid said, “Given the current tight liquidity condition, the move will provide new windows to the MSMEs to secure working capital. NBFCs will be another option before them besides the banks.”

Similarly, the finance minister also proposed to introduce a scheme to provide subordinate debt for entrepreneurs of MSMEs. “This subordinate debt to be provided by banks would count as quasi-equity and would be fully guaranteed through the Credit Guarantee Trust for Medium and Small Entrepreneurs (CGTMSE). The corpus of the CGTMSE would accordingly be augmented by the government,” said Sitharaman in her Budget speech. Extension of debt restructuring scheme was another demand of the MSMEs. The FM obliged them by proposing to more than five lakh MSMEs have benefitted from restructuring of debt permitted by RBI in the last year extending this window till March 31, 2021.

Suresh Agarwal, president of FORTI, who had urged the government for the extension of the window by a year in his recommendations prior to the budget, said, “This will save many MSMEs from being classified as NPAs.”

Sitharaman’s proposal to raise the turnover threshold for audit from the existing Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crore though got thumbs up, the rider that companies who carry out less than 5% of their business through cash transactions would be eligible dampened the enthusiasm.

Proposals like launching of an app-based invoice financing loans product to cut delays, and raising customs duty on items like footwear and furniture. But Baid said that the decisions to adopt a taxpayers’ charter will remove a lot of mistrust that exists between the businesses and the tax authorities. The government will notify details of the contents of the charter soon.

237,['2/02/2020'],Will Budget boost air connect to smaller cities?,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The Union government’s proposal to start 100 new airports under its UDAN regional connectivity scheme could prove to be a boon for small airports like Visakhapatnam, Rajahmundry and Vijayawada.

Aviation experts feel the main focus now will be on developing the smaller airports, which will lead to increase in number of flights from non-metro cities across the country. “A hundred new airports in smaller cities across the country mean at least 500 to 600 new flights. A better part of these flights would actually connect only the non-metro cities,” said an aviation expert in the city, who works with a private airline.

As of now, AP has four operational airports — Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Rajahmundry — all of which suffer from withdrawal of flights by different airlines. In the last two years, Visakhapatnam airport saw the withdrawal as many as 10-12 flights, including three international ones.

“There would be two advantages if the government seriously focuses on the smaller airports. First, the number of flights will go up. Second, competition would increase quality of on-board services even in non-metro sectors and would also make airfare competitive,” opined Joydeep Mukherjee, an international travel expert who has drafted the tourism policy for a few countries.

However, he warned that the government should be careful about selecting the cities and towns for the new airports, otherwise it might not prove to be lucrative for flight operators. “Selections should be made as per demand and infrastructure, and the airports should spread across all states and union territories,” added Mukherjee.

Representative image

JAIPUR: The new optional tax regime with additional tax slabs and reduced taxes has left taxpayers confused at large in Jaipur.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the new slabs and reduced tax in each slab along with an option to choose the existing tax regime left the taxpayers either calling their CA’s or making calculations on their own. The new regime doesn’t support any deductions and exemptions while the old does. Many have started making calculations to see which one saves them extra money.

City-based Shailendra Agarwal told STOI that every taxpayer has to make several calculations and pre-empt their financial decisions to come close to finalise either of the regime. “Those who don’t have any major deductions and exemptions like house rent allowance, mediclaim, LIC and other deductions, can opt for the new regime. While those who have several deductions can go with the old regime,” Agarwal said.

He added that it is premature to say which one one is good or bad for individuals. “Until you make the calculations, nobody will come to the conclusion which can save you more money,” he added.

The tax proposal says that those earning between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7.5 lakh will have to pay 10% tax and no deductions and exemptions while in the earlier tax regime it is 20% with deductions and exemptions. The taxpayers can choose either of them.

Samir Babel, an owner of an event management company, said most of the companies facilitate their employees in filing their tax returns and it is likely that they will pass the additional burden on them. “I have already asked my accountant to follow up with our employees as to which regime will help make more savings. So far, what I have understood that by and large majority of the taxpayers will go with the existing tax regime which is very convenient and easy,” Babel said.

JAIPUR: A 16-year-old boy was killed after being accidentally fired at by a drunk man in Karauli. According to police, the accused has a criminal record and would randomly fire in air but this time the bullet hit the teenager, who was standing on the roadside after leaving his animals in the forest area for grazing. The accused is yet to be arrested.

The deceased was identified as Teja Ram, who hailed from Langra in Karauli.

Dinesh Chand, SHO, Langra police station said, “The accused, Ramveer Gujjar, is a known criminal and in the past also, he had fired in air multiple times. On Saturday morning, he was drunk and carrying his weapon. Teja Ram came there after leaving his animals in the forest when Gujjar fired from his weapon and the bullet hit the boy, who died on the spot.”

The accused is absconding and cops are trying to find him. The SHO added, “We are trying to find the accused and check his old hideouts. We are getting in touch with his known accomplices to see if they know about his location. Our team is looking at various locations. We also have witnesses who saw the accused firing and will question them further in the case. They can tell where Gujjar went.”

According to cops, Gujjar has a long criminal history including dacoity and the villagers told police that Teja Ram died after the accused fired senselessly with a country-made firearm. “The villagers told us that the accused kept brandishing his weapon for a while before firing in a haphazard manner. He probably did not even realise that the teenager was standing in the line of fire,” added the official.

The victim’s post-mortem was done on Saturday and the body was handed over to the family and a case registered under relevant IPC sections.

Nagpur: Healthy food habits, nutritious and balanced diet alone can help people lose weight and not the fads many of them indulge in, said Dr Varsha, found chair of Indian Institute of Nutritional Sciences on Saturday..

She was speaking on ‘Weight reduction- nutrient myths’ at XVII annual scientific conclave, organized by the Nagpur chapter of Nutrition Society of India at the department of pharmaceutical sciences of Nagpur University.

People often believe that diets like Keto, Atkins, vegan and Paleo will help lose weight. Even the brand of diet control Dr Dixit and Divekar promote will not work in the long run, claimed Dr Varsha, a dietitian.

“Losing weight is not the linear process. It’s a long-term process full of fluctuations. Body composition keeps changing and weight management is all about coping with these changes,” she said.

Fad diets are unhealthy ways of losing weight. Indians should concentrate on traditional food rather than the ones based pm calories, Dr Varsha said. “What is the point of eating corn flex in breakfast when we already have better option like rice flex (poha) in our kitchens since generations? Indians have their own body types, metabolism and we should not apply western parameters for the purpose,” she said.

Earlier, pro vice-chancellor of Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) Dr Mohan Khamgaonkar inaugurated the event. Dr A Laxmaiah, scientist ‘G’ and head, public health, NIN-ICMR, delivered a keynote address. Talks on nutrition related subjects, poster and oral paper presentations also marked the daylong event.

THRISSUR: Health department officials here had to remind a China-returned MBBS student a legal provision to make her shift to a hospital from home.The 23-year-old woman, who returned from China where she has been studying, was found running mild temperature, but preferred prayers to medical treatment—based on her religious belief—to cure her condition.The young woman preferred staying home even after another student from the district had tested positive for novel coronavirus. She refused to follow the medical protocol, and did not report to health officials.Officials tracking those who had returned from China, found the woman missing.

JAIPUR: The Budget proposal of providing internship to fresh engineers in urban local bodies has been rejoiced by the technical education sector in the state. The proposal is like extending a silver leaf to the struggling technical education institutes in the state which are closing one after another. The proposal says that internship period will be for a year came at a time when campus placements are at an all-time low.

“I am delighted with the Budget proposal. First of all, internships are not available and secondly, if they are available, only for a month or two. This one-year internship programme will certainly give us the required training and confidence to take up bigger opportunities,” said Chandan Singh, a final-year engineering student.

Puneet Sharma, a technical education expert, feels that this is the most awaited decision taken by the government. “It will be a golden opportunity for the institutes and the students to make the most by taking up internship roles in their local government. It will help them in gaining much required experience which will make them more employable,” said Sharma.

State had once 198 engineering colleges which have reduced to little over 100 at present. Most of these colleges closed down in want of students. The poor quality of education along with poor placements has left very few students to take up engineering in the state.

Rahul Singhi, director of a private university in Jaipur feels that students can innovate and experiment and improve the governance of the local bodies. “The internship programme has to be linked with jobs also. A proper training module has to be made so that students can be trained and prepared for the challenges ahead. I am waiting to read more about the announcement,” said Singhi.

243,['2/02/2020'],Dividend tax leaves investors in a fix,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Jaipur: Investors dependent on the share market and mutual funds are unhappy with the Budget proposal of making dividend income from shares and mutual funds in the hand of recipient taxable. Many involved in the day-to-day trading of shares and investing in mutual funds in Jaipur said that this move may benefit the companies but will certainly become a deterrent for investments. However, those involved in long-term trading and bigger investments in the stocks believe that it will finally benefit the buyers.

“The dividend earned whatsoever would be added as income and is going to be taxable. Suppose my annual income from salary is Rs 4.75 lakh and if I get a dividend of Rs 35,000 in a financial year by some company, I would come under the taxable slab of Rs 5 lakh to Rs 7.5 lakh,” Mahesh Pareek, a Jaipur-based investor in stock market said.

According to the experts dealing the stock market, the provisions relating to the abolition of DDT will be effective from April 1. However, dividends declared between April 1, 2003, and March 31, 2020, will be subject to DDT under the old regime, while those declared after April 1, 2020, will be excluded.

“I would say it is a good move which is going to benefit both the companies and the shareholder. Abolishing the DDT which was earlier to be paid by the companies will enhance the quantum of dividend to be paid to the shareholder,” said Kapil Nagar, a chartered accountant based in Jaipur.

Others dealing with sale and purchase of shares added this will benefit investors in low tax brackets while those in higher brackets would be affected.

Vijayawada: Apart from the generic all-India railway initiatives, Andhra Pradesh did not find any specific mention for any infrastructure project in the 2020-21 Union Budget . With the decentralisation of the capital process already underway, a clear message of either deferring or cancelling all the proposed infrastructure development in Amaravati was noticed.

The Union finance minister too avoided mention of anything specific for Andhra Pradesh. Despite several proposals being handed over by Lok Sabha MPs from the state in the past, not a single one seem to have found mention in the budget.

Some of these proposals include improving passenger amenities across different stations, including Waltair division in the upcoming South Coastal Railway (SCoR) zone and train connecting Machilipatnam to Mumbai.

However, some of the measures that will have an impact on the state include solar power on vacant railway land under the National Solar Mission, overall capital expenditure of Rs 1.56 lakh crore for new railway lines, rolling stock, locomotives and electrification projects.

A portion of the Nirbhaya Fund of Rs 267 crore will also be allocated to AP for CCTV coverage and other security measures.

245,['2/02/2020'],‘Scribes should express views without fear’,"This story is from February 2, 2020

The event was organized on Friday

Nagpur: Babasaheb Ambedkar’s writing bound this country in unity and came to the aid of abolishing discrimination against minorities, said former minister for social justice Rajkumar Badole on Friday. Representation of people from the Bahujan community is important in the present times, he added.

Badole was speaking at the 100th anniversary of ‘Mooknayak’, Ambedkar’s first newspaper, being published. The programme was jointly organized by Yugandhar Creations, Vandana Sangh Deekshabhoomi and Lord Buddha Maitree Sangh to felicitate nearly 50 journalists, from across the country, who follow the principles of Ambedkar that challenge the dominant social problems.

Badole congratulated the awardees and inspired the journalists to be more vocal by quoting the first few lines of Javed Akhtar’s ghazal, “Jo baat kehte darte hai sab, tu woh baat likh. Itni andheri thi na kabhi pehle raat, likh.”

Criticizing the current scenario of journalism, senior journalist SN Vinod said, “100 years ago, Ambedkar wrote about how despair and injustice can be observed when we look in all four directions. We are witnessing the same situation at present. Even though politicians are responsible for it, media is one of the biggest complicities. We, as journalists, have become unreliable and it is shameful for me to admit in the society that I am a journalist.”

He said, “We saw absurd reporting in the recent occurrence in Delhi where a man took out a pistol and shot at people in which a student was injured as the police stood like bystanders. The editor-in-chief of a news channel said he had seen the video closely and that he believed blaming the police was wrong. Another anchor of the same channel said inaction of the police must be investigated. Yet another anchor revealed that the man was a minor. If journalists kneel before the power, we will be untrustworthy.”

Addressing the aspiring journalists, he said, “You will face several obstacles and this line of work will demand several sacrifices. But journalism is a field that requires sanctity.”

In his introductory speech, Bhaiyyaji Khairkar said, “Taking inspiration from Ambedkar’s journalistic values, there are countless newspapers who have been running for many years in the country. The current situation of counter-revolution in the country calls for today’s ‘Mooknayak’. We stand in need of people to speak out and write fearlessly and take the revolution of newspapers forward through Ambedkar’s lens because newspapers is a medium that can guide people on the right path at a time when the Constitution is being ripped apart.”

Present at the programme were journalists Baban Wadke, Gajanan Nimedeo and Babanrao Taywade, among others.

Artistes of Yugandhar Creations presented songs based on Ambedkar’s life. Anil Khobragade, Anil Hirekhan and Akanksha Nagarkar were the singers. The music was composed by Prabhakar Dhakde and Bhupesh Sawai.

246,['2/02/2020'],Shaheen Bagh &amp; Pakistan tweet: Yogi Adityanath targets CM Arvind Kejriwal at rallies,"Yogi Adityanath at Karawal Nagar

NEW DELHI: UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath , who launched a whirlwind campaign for BJP candidates in Delhi on Saturday, had political temperature soaring with his remark that “Arvind Kejriwal has Pakistan links and thus the Pakistan federal minister is seeking votes for him.” In keeping with his reputation for making no-holds barred speeches, he accused the Kejriwal government of “supplying biryani to the Shaheen Bagh protesters”.Reacting to the allegation, senior AAP functionary Sanjay Singh said, “Yogi should be arrested immediately and questioned to get the information he has about Kejriwal’s Pakistan links.” Singh pointed out that 60 children had died in Gorakhpur, UP, due to lack of oxygen and the UP government appears to be standing with rapists. “I want to advise him to have a grip on his language.”AAP is planning to lodge a complaint with the Election Commission over Yogi’s remarks in which he said Kejriwal has links with Pakistan.Slamming Kejriwal on various fronts, including developmental work, Yogi indirectly accused him of funding the Shaheen Bagh protests. “Those who support terrorists in Kashmir are protesting at Shaheen Bagh,” he said at a public meeting in Rohini. He also accused the Kejriwal government of “opposing” the hanging of the Nirbhaya convicts.A dusty, congested Karawal Nagar chowk — which was converted into a fortress — was overflowing with a crowd restless to get a glimpse of Yogi and hear him. Many had climbed trees, buildings and even signboards for a better view. He was welcomed with loud cheers when he emerged on the dais set up in a corner with his picture as the backdrop.Raking up the call given by Pakistan federal minister Fawad Hussain Chaudhry on Twitter to defeat PM Narendra Modi in the Delhi assembly elections , Yogi said abolition of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir was a setback for Pakistan. “Had it not troubled Pakistan, the Pakistan minister would not have sought votes for Kejriwal in the Delhi elections ,” said Yogi.The UP CM addressed four back-to-back rallies in Jahangirpuri, Narela and Rohini assembly constituencies where he focused primarily on Shaheen Bagh. The protests are not against CAA but to oppose India’s emergence as a power centre in the world, he said. “Their (protesters) ancestors divided the country and they are opposed to the fact that now India is becoming Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat,” said Yogi.The CM said that people of Delhi need better roads, rapid rail, clean air and water and not Shaheen Bagh. “Only BJP can provide all these because all the funds of the Kejriwal government is spent in funding Shaheen Bagh like protests,” he said.Yogi reminded the crowd that AAP had failed to keep its promise of appointing a Lokpal. He blamed Kejriwal for the smog in Delhi. “He also has breathing difficulties. He goes to Bangalore for treatment. He spends 12 days in a naturopathy centre but plays with the health of the citizens of Delhi,” said Yogi.He said he had found the roads in Karawal Nagar and Mustafabad in a bad condition and slammed Kejriwal over it. He also blamed him for allegedly not releasing funds for the rapid rail project between Delhi and Meerut and not issuing an NOC for construction of an expressway from Delhi to Haridwar. He said that the UP government is working towards making the Ganga clean, but Kejriwal’s indifference made Yamuna poisonous.A group of people sitting near the dais at Narela were heard shouting, ‘Desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maro saalon ko’. Turning to them, Yogi asked them to recognise the power of ballot, not bullet. “Recognize the value of each vote in the election. Ballot not bullet is the biggest strength of democracy. I have come to make an appeal to you to use the ballot,” he said.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73863053,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-222607,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/shaheen-bagh-pak-tweetyogi-targets-cm-at-rallies/articleshow/73854666.cms
247,['2/02/2020'],ESZ around Mukundara tiger turf opposed,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Jaipur: Enraged with the inclusion of their villages in the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of the Mukundara Hills Tiger Reserve (MHTR), residents of four villages staged a protest against the forest administration alleging that they have been ‘cheated’.

After the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change issued a draft notification to declare one-kilometre eco-sensitive zone in many areas around the MHTR, villagers of Morkukala, Morkunj, Darrah and Kalikui have started protesting as this will prohibit all types of construction in their farms.

Devi Shankar, who is spearheading the protest, said, “The forest officials did not consult any villager before including their land in ESZ. If the forest department forcefully include our lands, it will be a violation of our rights.”

The protesters also threatened that if their villages are not excluded from the eco-sensitive zone of the tiger reserve, they will not allow forest officials to enter MHTR. Chief conservator of forests (CCF), wildlife, Kota, Anand Mohan, said, “According to SC guidelines, a 10-kilometre ESZ should be left around a tiger reserve, but we are restricting it to 1/10th. Also, there are certain activities which come under prohibited, regulated and permitted. Villagers can go ahead with construction, but there are vested interests which want to convert MHTR into a concrete jungle. If villagers want to reconstruct their houses, they can do so, and I don’t think ESZ will create any problem.”

On January 10, the ministry had issued a draft notification to declare a 1km eco-sensitive zone around MHTR, which is spread over 759.99sqkm covering four districts of Kota, Bundi, Chittorgarh and Jhalawar. The ministry has sought suggestions and objections within 60 days.

This is the first tiger reserve in the state for which an ESZ will be declared. The MHTR, established in 2013, encompasses areas of Mukundara Hills National Park, Dara Sanctuary, Jawahar Sagar Sanctuary and part of National Chambal Ghariyal Sanctuary (From Garadia Mahadev to Jawahar Sagar Dam) which constitutes its core area.

A senior forest official said the eco-sensitive zones will be treated as a ‘breathing space’ for wildlife. It is demarcated based on their ecological importance which reins in development activities inimical to wildlife and their habitats. While the zone will be completely compatible to livelihoods of local communities living around the tiger reserve, it will bring the order on tourism, mining activities, industries and other footloose development activities disrupting wildlife corridors outside the reserve boundary

As a result, the sensex crashed 988 points__the biggest single-session points drop on a Budget day__to close at 39,736, a three-month closing low. The day’s sharp dive in the market also left investors poorer by Rs 3.5 lakh crore with BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 153 lakh crore.In Saturday’s session, HDFC group was hit the sharpest since market players say tough time for financial sector firms if the rate of interest remains sticky. In addition, insurance and mutual fund companies were hit by the FM’s proposal to do away with IT exemptions for individuals in favour of lower income tax rates. HDFC, ITC, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank contributed the most to the sensex’s slide while higher closing for TCS, HUL and Infosys cushioned the fall marginally.The FM, however, changed some rules which are expected to enthuse foreign funds to invest in India. According to Rashesh Shah, Chairman & CEO, Edelweiss Group, the FM has sent out a very positive signal to foreign investors through exemptions to sovereign wealth funds to invest in infrastructure and the abolition of dividend distribution tax, “to reaffirm their faith in the India growth story.” Institutional dealers too feel that with central banks readying to pump in cash to revive a slowing global economy, FPIs are expected to continue to buy into the India story.On the other side of the spectrum, market’s expectations about strong fiscal and other measures to bring the economy back on track, were not met. “The proposed listing of LIC (the government-owned largest life insurer in India), abolition of dividend distribution tax are positives but markets were hopeful of fiscal measures to kick start the economy and the Budget fell short on this count,” said Raamdeo Agrawal, chairman, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.The day’s selling was across the board with BSE’s midcap and smallcap indices, both closing 2.2% lower. Among the sectoral indices, real estate, capital goods and industrials losing the most with IT and Teck indices closing with marginal gains.

NEW DELHI: A loud cheer greeted Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari when he turned up at a public meeting at Rani Garden on Saturday. Since it was his birthday, a cake had also been ordered to celebrate the occasion.Standing amid BJP flags, Tiwari began his speech by attacking chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for mocking his song “Rinkiya ke Papa”. “AAP is making memes of the song. But they should understand that Rinkiya in the song refers to daughters. By mocking the song, AAP and Kejriwal are demeaning the role of daughters and women in society,” he asserted.Recently, Kejriwal, when asked for his views about the Delhi BJP president, had referred to Tiwari as a “good singer” who had rendered “Rinkiya ke Papa”. “I pity his (Kejriwal’s) intelligence. The girl child ratio is declining. At a time when Beti Bachao is trending in the country, he is mocking men for having daughters. Is it a curse to have a daughter?” Tiwari asked.“The Centre has allocated Rs 40 lakh in each district of all states for investing in welfare projects for the girl child. However, not a penny has been used in Delhi by the AAP government,” said Tiwari.Earlier in the day, Tiwari carried out a padyatra in South Ganesh Nagar. Even as he waved to people in the balconies, many in the crowd rushed to take a selfie with him. Tiwari said that he failed to understand how Kejriwal claimed that the last five years were well spent. “For four and a half years, Delhi government was just cursing the Modi government and lieutenant governor for not letting AAP work. How come everything has become so positive all of a sudden?” he asked.Taking a dig at the Rs 66,000 crore budget of Delhi government, Tiwari said, “Despite such a huge budget, Delhi couldn’t get new flyovers, university, Wi-Fi, quality water, roads, among other things.”",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73864582,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-231491,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/kejriwal-insulted-daughters-by-making-fun-of-my-song/articleshow/73854687.cms

Vijayawada: N Prateep Kumar, the state principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) said on Saturday that around 35 per cent of marshlands across Andhra Pradesh have already been destroyed. Kumar further said that the marshlands have been destroyed predominantly due to pollution.

Speaking at a state-level workshop on wetlands, Kumar said that there are 31 wetlands in the state and that the state forest department will set up district-level committees headed by collectors to chart out required measures to conserve wetlands in the region.

According to Kumar, other reasons for the destruction of wetlands in the region include construction activity and urbanisation.

Some major wetlands in Andhra Pradesh are Koleru, Koringa, Nelapattu, Pulicat and Uppalapadu. A large number of birds from across the world migrate to these areas post-monsoon for nesting and stay till March.

“We want to take each district as a unit. A report will be submitted by the committees to the forest department and we will execute those measures to ensure that these wetlands are protected,” Kumar further said addressing the gathering.

He further informed that the initiative will be launched from February 2—World Marshland Day, which came into being in 1971 during the Forest Convention.

G Khudros, professor of Sakhiyaan Institute in Coimbatore and an expert in marshland conservation attended the event as the chief guest. He spoke about various techniques used across the world to conserve marshlands.

Except Chittorgarh, all districts of the state have JAS. Jaipur has the highest 18 JAKs (Jan Aushadhi Kendras) in the state. Almost each government hospital in Jaipur has JAKs, where patients get generic medicines at affordable prices. In the state, there are 134 PMBJP.

According to a reply to a question in Lok Sabha, the Centre mentioned that the product basket of PMBJP covers more than 800 medicines and 154 surgicals and consumables covering all therapeutic groups such as anti-infectives, anti-diabetics, cardiovasculars, anti-cancers and gastro-intestinal medicines.

The Centre is planning to strengthen its network of JAS as it is targeting to provide 2,000 medicines and 300 surgical items by 2024 to patients from its JAS network. According to the health department officials, the patients can buy generic medicines at JAS situated at Sawai Man Singh Hospital and Kanwatia Hospital.

In all the 33 districts, the facility of JAS is already available except in Chittorgarh. The announcement by the finance minister of setting up JAS in each district, will help Chittorgarh to get one such shop of generic medicines.

Under the scheme, any NGO, charitable society, institution, self-help group with experience of minimum three years of successful operation in welfare activities, is eligible to open the Jan Aushadhi Store outside the hospital premises.

AJMER: The additional district collector (city), who was on an inspection of the midday meal scheme at Government Girls’ Senior Secondary School in Shrinagar, joined the students for lunch and took feedback on the quality of the food served at the school.

Additional district collector Suresh Sindhi asked the principal and teachers of the school to sit with him on the ground during the meal and directed them to ensure that the food served is healthy and fresh.

The school staff members were surprised as senior officials usually don’t taste the midday meal given to students. “It is unusual to see a senior official sitting on the ground with children and having midday meal,” a teacher said. Generally, teachers got to the staffroom during lunch and the other staff members of the school serve food to the students, she added.

Meanwhile, Sindhi asked the school principals to maintain the quality and taste of the food served to the students by the state government and also take regular feedback from students to bring in change. Sindhi said the midday meal that he was served was good and fresh. He added that the attendance of the girl students at the school was also good.

VIJAYAWADA: The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee ( AIKSCC ) based out of Andhra Pradesh slammed the Union Budget for ‘doing little’ to boost the rural economy .

A statement issued by the farmers ’ organisation said, “The total budget allocation for agriculture, irrigation and rural development was Rs 2.68 lakh crore in 2019-20, which has been increased nominally to Rs 2.83 lakh crore. In real terms, taking inflation into account, this amounts to zero increase.”

The Union Budget proposes increased penetration of MNCs and corporate giants in agriculture inputs supply, procurement of crops, storage, agriculture-processing, insurance and marketing of crops. However, the farmers’ association feels that it gives no relief to peasants from high input costs, low crop prices, distress sale and crop losses.

AIKSCC came down heavily on the Modi government and has said, “We are very disappointed. This is clearly a Budget that has no space for farmers of this country.”

Bareilly: The new income tax regime unveiled by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Union Budget 2020 has perplexed the salaried class, who are now in a dilemma whether to stick with the old slab rate or opt for the new one.

According to the FM, the new tax regime is optional and would require the taxpayers to forego their claims on exemptions and deductions.

Manoj Sharma, director of national informatics centre in Bareilly, said it is good step of giving some relaxation to salaried class, but there is some lack of clarity about the new tax regime.

“I hope things will be clear once we get through the new tax regime in detail. As of now, it is not clear whether we would be able to get benefit on investment in various government schemes under 80 C and 80 D or not. There was no mention of saving related government schemes in the finance minister’s Budget speech,” he said.

Rajen Vidyarthi, a chartered accountant, said, “We now expect more clients to turn up as the new tax regime is bound to create confusion, as people will not be able to differentiate between two tax regimes wisely. In the new tax regime, taxes are reduced but now taxpayer will not be able to get benefits of various investment schemes exempted from taxes under 80 C and 80 D.”

Dr Amanjot Kaur, a teacher in Government Girls Inter College, however, welcomed the new tax rates.

“I welcome the government’s step. I will have 5% additional income, which can be spent on our kids’ education or in saving. Besides, we can use this money for tourism purposes.”

Pilibhit: Field forest force and police have recovered the partially eaten body of a 65-year-old villager in Mala range of Pilibhit Tiger Reserve on Saturday morning. The deceased was identified as Phool Chand of Baijunagar village under Gajraula police station. He went missing after he went to his sugarcane field on Friday afternoon. His family accompanied by forest force personnel found his body around 400 meters deep into the core forest area.

Deputy director of PTR Naveen Khandelwal said forest officials are yet to confirm whether the man had intruded into the core forest area where he was mauled by some wild carnivore or his body was dumped in the jungle by some criminals who killed him and it was eaten by the wild animals.

However, deceased’s nephew, Jeevan Lal claimed that he and other villagers had seen a tigress and two cubs eating the Phool Chand’s body. Police and foresters are awaiting his autopsy report.

Makhan Lal, deceased’s son, alleged that the tigress along with its cubs had been moving about in the agricultural area, adjoining Garha forest beat for a couple of months but the forest officials had not taken any action in the matter. He claimed that his father was killed by the tigress and dragged into the jungle, where it was eaten.

Khandelwal said Phool Chand’s field was about 1km from PTR. But, the forest force could not find any pugmarks of the tigress in the area or signs of the body being dragged. He said the department on humanitarian grounds had arranged for Rs 10,000 through World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) for the bereaved family for performing the last rites. However, the family was not eligible for compensation as the killing had taken place inside the core forest area.

Asked about the murder angle, SHO of Gajraula police station, Naresh Kumar Kashyap, ruled it out, saying that the body’s condition indicated that he was killed by a wild animal.

Dehradun: While the measures announced to boost the agri sector and farmers in the Union Budget 2020 were hailed as a welcome move for Uttarakhand, the Himalayan state was left largely disappointed as no special announcement was made for projects in Uttarakhand. Also, there were no fund allocations announced for the Kumbh Mela acheduled to be held in Haridwar in 2021.

Providing a perspective on what the budget meant for Uttarakhand, financial analyst Rajendra Bisht told TOI, “The state will be benefitted from the reforms and changes announced in the agri sector. However, since most farmers are based in Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar, the benefits will largely be limited to these districts.” He added that the decision to set up solar pumps for 20 lakh farmers and grid-connected pump sets for 15 lakh farmers has a great potential in Uttarakhand.

“Over Rs 2.83 lakh crore would be invested in agriculture, rural development, irrigation and allied activities. This will largely help the state government in achieving its target of doubling the income of farmers,” Bisht said.

He, however, added that more concrete steps in the field of manufacturing could have helped Uttarakhand, which is eyeing to invite more industrialists to the state. “The corridors being made to strengthen infrastructure by spending Rs 103 lakh crore will help the state but more steps are required to boost the manufacturing sector.”

Tourism professionals though were disappointed that even though Uttarakhand is a tourism state, no major project was announced in the sector although the development of North-east and the union territories of J&K and Ladakh had been included in the budget.

261,['2/02/2020'],Oh crap! Cow dung creates craters on tar road laid a week ago,"This story is from February 2, 2020

The road in Ayodhya Nagar was asphalted just a week ago

Nagpur: The quality of road works done by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation has plunged to a new low. Now, they no longer need heavy rains to develop potholes because it seems even cow dung is enough to damage them.

A road in Ayodhya Nagar under NMC Hanuman Nagar Zone is the best example. The NMC through contractor Amruta Constructions had asphalted three internal roads of length around 300 metres at Ayodhya Nagar at the cost of Rs20 lakh a week ago.

Couple of days back, cattle came on the roads and dumped at several spots. The road’s surface has scaled at spots where the cow dung was dumped. It has become a topic of discussion in the area.

After TOI pointed it out, officials of NMC Hanuman Nagar Zone including assistant commissioner Raju Bhivgade inspected the road and confirmed potholes have developed on spots wherever the cattle had left the dump.

“I am surprised to see the newly asphalted patches damaged due to cow dung. Engineers from NMC public works department (PWD) will be able to comment why this happened. Other parts of the road is in good condition,” Bhivgade said.

NMC chief engineer Ulhas Debadwar said it clearly proves that the quality of asphalting was not good. “We will inspect and initiate appropriate action,” he said.

Inferior quality of tar road are damaged due to rains or heavy traffic. There is not much water content in cow dung, still the road in Ayodhya Nagar was damaged. This indicates that the road will be damaged totally in case of rain.

TOI has many a time reported about inferior quality of works in tar as well as cement concrete roads. Even, asphalting done by NMC Hotmix Department can’t hold on for weeks though the defect liability period is of three years.

TOI had reported about damage to patches asphalted on road at Sonegaon lake within a week due to mild rain in the beginning of January. The department again asphalted the same patches couple of days ago, thus wasting public money.

RTI activist TH Naidu said the cost should be recovered from NMC engineers and contractor. “Engineers are never present when roads are asphalted by contractors. Engineers clear bills sitting in offices. I can name many roads asphalted within one year though their defect liability period was three years. Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe should appoint engineering colleges as third-party agency to inspect roads. Bills should be cleared only after satisfactory report,” he said.

NAGPUR: The committee headed by chairman of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) Health Consultative Committee Virendra Kukreja has taken a decision to restart working of sanitary workers under GPS Watch System. It was abandoned a few months ago following strong opposition from sanitary workers.

Mayor Sandip Joshi has constituted and directed the committee to conduct study and suggest measures related to the abandoned GPS Watch System. Accordingly, the Kukreja-led committee held a meeting on Saturday and directed the NMC health department to repair the watches. The committee is likely to suggest working of sanitary workers with the GPS Watch System.

Corporator Dayashankar Tiwari, Sunil Agrawal , additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi, health officer (sanitation) Dr Pradip Dasarwar and assistant legal officer Prakash Barde were present in the meeting.

To curb the salary scam and ensure cleanliness, the NMC in association with Bengaluru-based ITI Limited, a central government undertaking, launched the GPS Watch System 22 months ago. Under the system, the attendance of workers was to be registered as per the record of GPS Watches. 8,000 workers and some officials were given watches. The NMC was supposed to pay Rs 207 per person per month for a total of Rs 16.56 lakh per month to the company.

After an inordinate delay, the NMC started to release salaries of workers as per the system in June last year. The workers strongly opposed the system and it was put on hold.

264,['2/02/2020'],Farm activists back move to adopt three central model laws for states,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Nagpur: Farm activists have backed finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s move of encouraging states to adopt three central model laws for farmland leasing, contract farming and agriculture produce marketing.

There is a view that due to shrinking farm holdings, there is a need for the state to have laws facilitating land leasing and contract farming, so that economic viability of agriculture increases.

Sitharaman said the government will encourage states to implement the three model laws already framed by the Centre, namely the Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act , 2016, Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017, and Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2018.

Sources in the state’s bureaucracy said a law along the lines of the Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2017 was moved in the state legislature by the previous government. However, it was withdrawn from the legislative council following objections by certain large agriculture produce-marketing committees (APMCs) operating in the state.

Now there are plans to put up the case before the current government once again, said an official. The law calls for reforms in APMCs, which control the farm produce market.

“The state has not passed any law on leasing or contract farming in line with the Centre’s model acts, said Kishore Tiwari, chairman of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), the state government thinktank on agriculture crisis mitigation.

“The reforms are needed so that contract farming and leasing of land is facilitated. Shrinking holdings have made it difficult to reap profits out of individual farming. However, it is also discouraging that the Budget speech did not have any mention of priority sector lending or funding the states for granting bailout packages to farmers. Loan waivers by eight states prove that agriculture is no longer a profitable business,” Tiwari added.

Anil Ghanawat, the president of Shetkari Sangathana said that contract farming can help the farmers get a fixed income and assured market. “The firm taking land on contractual basis can directly sell the produce to the end user, which in turn can assure returns for the grower,” Ghanawat stated.

“Informal contract farming is already prevalent in the state. Due to shortage of holdings, the farmers lease land to increase the area under cultivation. Having a law will also secure the tenants’ rights. It should also be ensured that any bailout package announced by the government should go to the leaseholder instead of the land owner,” said Vijay Jawandhia, a veteran farm activist from Wardha.

265,['2/02/2020'],Budget gets thumbs up from Indian Industries Association,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Bareilly: Members of the Indian Industries Association (IIA) applauded Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for presetting a “budget which reflected Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic vision”.

Speaking to TOI, national vice-president of IIA, Suresh Sundrani, said the government’s decision to increase custom duty on imported goods would strengthen the micro small and medium enterprises (MSME).

“Moral of the Union Budget 2020 is that people who earn more should contribute more. The government has tried to put more money into the hands of the middle class which is good for the industry as well as economy. However the budget allocation of Rs 3 lakh crore for skill development is not enough, considering the size of our population. Also introducing training programmed for engineering graduate is a good concept,” Sundrani said.,” Sundrani said.

One of the renewed industrialists in Rohilkhand region and owner of a mustard oil production company, Ghanshyam Khandelwal, said, “By reducing the corporate tax for solar energy industry from 22% to 15% clearly reflects the PM’s vision of moving towards green energy from coal-based industry.”

Ashutosh Sharma, a young entrepreneur who runs a soya food unit, said the government should have thought about the social security for industrialissts, which he found missing in the budget.

“A businessman works tirelessly throughout his life, but sometimes a single mistake proves lethal to shut down the unit. If it happens at the age of 55 or 60, it becomes very difficult to overcome that situation. For the taxpayers like us there must be a provision that the government provide at least medical security to the businessman, who becomes insolvent for any reason.”

Another IIA official, RK Goel, said the increased custom duty on furniture would benefit local industry in Bareilly to a large extent.

“Bareilly is largely known for embroidery work and furniture industries. Bareilly’s cane made furniture has been in demand across the country, but for the past couple of years, Chinese low cost furniture have made a big dent on this industry. Now, with increased custom duty on imported furniture, local furniture industries will get strengthened for sure.”

Meanwhile, Ajay Shukla, president of Bhojipura industrial area who runs a packaging unit termed the Union Budget 2020 as “eyewash”.

“The FM didn’t give any relief to the MSME section, which is already on the ventilator. There is already a slump in sale. The government should have given some exemption in GST,” Shula said.

Bareilly: The Union Budget 2020 which was presented by Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday has nothing much for us, said exporters at Moradabad’s renowned brass industry. The Union finance minister has increased custom duty on imports but they are export-based and the metal they use largely come from local markets, the exporters said.

Besides, they are disappointed with GST due to which their 18% working capital is stuck for the past six months. The brass industry demands relaxation in GST on local purchase of metal for their survival.

The annual turnover of Moradabad brass industry is around Rs 15,000 crore among which a large portion of Rs 10,000 crore comes from export. According to Moradabad Handicraft Export Association, close to 3,500 exporters are running their units in the district and 5 lakh artisans are associated with it.

Association president, Avdhesh Agrawal, said that Budget 2020 was highly disappointing for the brass handicraft exporters of Moradabad. “Until 1999, there was no tax on export. But now, we are paying 18% GST. Claiming that duty drawback is cumbersome process. We purchases raw material either from copper and brass industries or from local markets. We are ready to pay tax on metal purchased from industry, but our only demand is that there must be relaxation while buying raw material from furnaces running locally,” he said.

Another exporter, Sarfaraz Akhtar, said that the buyers didn’t pay them money in advance and GST returns come after several months. “Earlier, our export was higher in multifold than local supply but today both are almost at par, which is not good for the industry. In local market, there are few customers for quality products. We used to get a decent amount of foreign orders for quality products. Today, we have very little working capital for doing business. If the government extends some incentives to our industry, only then we would be able to survive,” he said.

Association patron Najam ul Islam told TOI, “It is not an encouraging Budget for us. Our only demand was to ease GST provisions as 18% of our working capital is stuck for several months. Besides, it would be nice if government continues 7% licence incentive on export after March 31.”

CHARMINAR: Many BEd students protested outside Hidayah Junior College , in Muradnagar , under Asif Nagar police station limits, on Saturday, alleging that the management didn’t issue them hall tickets for the first semester exam.

The students said that when they reached the college to appear for their first semester exam, scheduled for Saturday, officials asked them to leave because the college had not yet received the exam’s hall tickets. Instead, the students alleged, the management asked them to start preparing for their second semester exam.

Students said that though they had cleared their fees and were ready to appear for the exam, almost 66 of them were not allowed entry. “This happened due to the apathy of the college authorities. The college authorities said that they couldn’t issue us hall tickets because they were not granted permission by the university. Though they assured us that we would be allowed for the next semester exam, their apathy and carelessness have hurt out sentiments,” said Mehtab, one of the agitated students.

College authorities claimed that the late admission process had caused the problem. “We assured the students that they would be allowed to write their exam in the second semester,” said Riyazuddin , director of Hidayah Junior College.

Azam Khan

RAMPUR: After taking possession of 17 bighas of land of Mohammad Ali Jauhar University , the Rampur administration would be sending demolition notice to its chancellor Samajwadi Party (SP) MP Azam Khan on Monday. They plan to raze down the medical science faculty building within a week, sources said.

The university was built by Azam, and the Rampur administration said the SP leader encroached upon the government land and illegally constructed the building.

“After taking possession of the government land which comprises 17 bighas on the university campus, we are now going to issue notice to the Jauhar Trust, run by Azam Khan, and the university authorities to remove their illegal encroachments, which includes the faculty of medical science building,” Rampur district magistrate (DM) Aunjaneya Kumar Singh said on Saturday.

The DM added that if the Jauhar Trust fails to comply with the notice, the building would be demolished and the university authorities would have to bear the expenses incurred during the demolition process.

Meanwhile, SP’s state unit president Naresh Uttam Patel said a delegation led by leader of opposition at the state assembly Ramnath Govind will be reaching Rampur to inspect the ongoing measures carried out by the administrative officials.

On Friday, a team of revenue officials led by sub-divisional magistrate, Sadar, Prem Prakash Tiwari, carried out an inspection of the site and “demarcated the disputed land”. The move comes in the wake of the revenue board order, which dismissed an appeal filed by the Jauhar University on January 20, challenging the SDM order declaring the land occupied as “illegal”.

270,['2/02/2020'],"Raised limit for MSME audits welcomed, but not deemed enough","This story is from February 2, 2020

Nagpur: The Budget proposal to hike the turnover threshold for micro , small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to conduct mandatory tax audit — from Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crore — will benefit at least 40% of the units in the region, as per local industrialists.

A turnover of five crore is considerably high for a large number of units here, which will help ease tax compliance for the sector, they feel.

Industrialist Pravin Tapadia claimed that the raised slab for MSME tax audits will reduce the burden on businesspersons, as it will help around 40-50% of the enterprises.

“Most MSMEs have a turnover of less than Rs 5 crore, so it will help them with ease of business. But the Goods and Services Tax (GST) audit is compulsory for companies having a turnover of more than Rs 2 crore. So, the audit is conducted anyway at the slab of Rs 2 crore,” Tapadia said.

“Several companies prefer undertaking an audit when their turnover is less, as it gives them authenticity,” he added.

Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA) president Suresh Rathi, who welcomed the decision of raising the turnover threshold for audit of MSMEs, said it is applicable to units where 95% of the transactions take place through the banking channel.

“It will help the MSMEs to keep their accounting in order. As most of them usually work on cash basis, this will lead to the promotion of cashless economy too. However, we had expected the government to do a lot more for the uplift of MSMEs, as this industry creates jobs for the youth,” Rathi added.

Julfesh Shah, a member of the committee on management accounting under the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), New Delhi, said, “This year’s Budget has stressed more on MSMEs rather than large-scale industries. Now the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) can also do invoice financing; earlier it was not allowed for MSMEs, so they had to go to banks for cash flow management. Due to this, they used to face shortage of funds.”

“But now that they have opened it for NBFCs, MSMEs can raise invoices for pending money and take it from NBFCs, which will regulate their cash flow and can also be subordinated by banks,” Shah added. He also welcomed the move to extend the restructuring of non-performing assets (NPAs) of MSMEs by one year, emphasizing that it would help keep several MSMEs afloat.

The abolition of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) was also praised by several experts, but they raised concerns regarding the tax burden on dividend recipients. “The scrapping of DDT will incentivize more foreign investors to invest in Indian industries. However, the recipients of the dividend will now have to pay the tax amount as per their tax slab,” said Shah.

271,['2/02/2020'],Nirbhaya case: Nirbhaya convicts taking legal process for a ride: Plea in Delhi high court,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Nirbhaya’s mother breaks down after a Delhi court on Friday indefinitely postponed hanging of the four convict... Read More

NEW DELHI: Terming it a “classic case where the four Nirbhaya case convicts had taken the legal process for a ride”, the Centre and Delhi Police on Saturday moved Delhi high court seeking to fast-track the hanging of the death row inmates.

The Centre, in its plea, argued that pendency of the mercy plea of one convict in a case of multiple death row inmates can’t be used as a ground to stay hanging of those who had exhausted all available legal options. The plea submitted that the convicts could be hanged separately, if required. The mercy plea of Mukesh Singh and Vinay Sharma have been rejected by the President.

Justice Suresh Kait, after a nearly hour-long hearing, issued a notice to the four convicts to respond to the government’s plea seeking their immediate execution and setting aside of the trial court’s order staying the hanging scheduled for February 1. Acknowledging the urgency of the matter, the court fixed the next hearing on Sunday, a court holiday.

Appearing for the Centre and police, solicitor general Tushar Mehta sought setting aside of the trial court’s stay order, arguing that it was clear that the four convicts were “acting in tandem” to frustrate the sentencing.

“This case will go down in history as one of the rare ones where the accused in heinous crimes have classically abused the process of law and tried the patience of the country,” Mehta submitted, urging the court to step in so that death warrants could be executed immediately.

The senior law officer read out the rules of Delhi Jail Manual 2018, which govern execution of death penalty and maintained the trial court erred while assuming if even one prisoner’s mercy plea was filed, the hanging couldn’t take place.

“If this is how law has to be interpreted, then no sentence can be executed. Hanging has to be done one by one. Those who have exhausted their legal remedies can be executed. Else, one co-convict can ensure delay for others in the same case and make them wait, a dehumanising effect as per Supreme Court rulings,” Mehta submitted before Justice Kait.

The Centre’s plea challenging the trial court order made a similar point and argued that a joint reading of the jail provisions “makes it clear that it is only in case of pendency of the mercy petition of the prisoner/convict concerned that execution would remain stayed during the aforesaid period”.

Earlier in the day, the plea was first mentioned before Chief Justice DN Patel for an urgent hearing and it was marked to Justice Kait. The plea made parties the convicts — Singh, Sharma, Pawan Gupta and Akshay Thakur — director general (prisons) and superintendent of Tihar Jail.

The plea said the trial court had acted beyond its jurisdiction in postponing the death warrants “till further orders”, adding that the judge failed to consider that the convicts were found guilty for the gruesome and horrible offence of gang rape and murder of a woman.

It further argued that the convicts were given sufficient opportunity to avail all legal remedies, but they deliberately chose to delay the process of filing their pleas. Explaining why it approached the court, the Centre said it was the nodal agency to maintain law and order in Delhi and also the department concerned to process the mercy petitions filed by any death row convict in the national capital.

The plea said the conduct of the convicts clearly showed their intention to delay the process of execution of death sentence , which is not only an abuse of the process of law but also mockery of courts and the judicial system.

KOLKATA: West Bengal and the fringes of Kolkata will benefit from FM Nirmala Sitharaman’s sops to boost the affordable housing sector, feel developers in the city. Kolkata’s major realty players pointed out that this would help the housing sector in a big way.

Credai, West Bengal, president and Merlin group chairman Sushil Mohta said that most of the projects are affordable on the northern and southern fringes. “According to our estimates, 70% of the projects in and around Kolkata are in the affordable range,” he added.

Ambuja Neotia Group chairman Harsh Neotia also felt that the proposal will benefit eastern India and West Bengal more. “The inventories in this category here are substantial,” he added. President-elect of Credai National H V Patodia said that the measures for extension of timeline for the benefits will boost the demand for affordable housing in the region.

Siddha Group MD Sanjay Jain, who has number of units in this category, said “Since most of the projects in Bengal, including those in Kolkata, are under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, it will be a boon for real estate,” he added. Shrachi Group MD Ravi Todi said, “As demand had not picked up during the current fiscal, the sops will give people opportunity to buy more homes and avail the benefit and also more projects can be launched by developers,” he added. Mundhra Construction MD Aditya Mumdra said that following the announcement, new projects in the state will generate employment.

273,['2/02/2020'],Depositors can bank on 5-fold hike in insurance,"This story is from February 2, 2020

File photo

The government decision to allow insurance cover for up to Rs 5 lakh of deposits from the current Rs 1 lakh will increase investor faith in deposits in the midst of failing cooperative banks and rumours of weak banks. The flip side is that banks will have to pay a higher premium to the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation – an arm of RBI which provides the cover.

As on March 31, 2019, around 28% of bank deposits (in value terms) and around 92% of depositors (in terms of the number of accounts) were covered by deposit insurance, which is likely to increase to around 40-50%.

“The proposal is a highly confidence-boosting measure and should support the deposit accretion of banks. However, given that the size of insured deposits is likely to increase, the deposit insurance premium paid by banks will increase the operating expenses of banks and will be negative for their profitability to the extent they are not able to pass it on to the bank customers,” said Karthik Srinivasan , SVP & Group Head, Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA Ltd.

The issue of deposit insurance came to the limelight with the PMC Bank crisis, where the public at large learnt that only Rs 1 lakh of their deposit was insured by banks. According to the DICGC’s annual report, banks are currently paying Rs 100 per Rs 1 lakh deposit which translates into a cost of 0.1% on the deposit.

According to the Mrutyunjay Mahapatra, MD & CEO of Syndicate Bank, the increase in premium will depend on the number of accounts that have such high balances. He adds that there has not been enough debate on the pricing of deposit insurance.

Private banks are comfortable with the issue of a higher premium. “While this could mean some expenditure for the banks, this would certainly give comfort to retail savers. Similarly, the proposal to amend banking laws to strengthen cooperative banks should also infuse more confidence among savers,” said R. K. Gurumurthy - Head Treasury, Lakshmi Vilas Bank.

According to Srinivasan, even if the cost is passed on to all the banks the impact would be marginal on their balance sheet. “On a return on assets (ROA) basis, the impact would be only a couple of basis points,” he said.

The stronger PSU banks feel that there should be risk-based pricing . DICGC’s deposit insurance fund has been mobilized largely from premium paid by public sector banks. But almost its entire claims are from failed cooperative banks.

Alpesh Mehta, banking analyst at Motilal Oswal said that banks are likely to pass on the cost to customers. “Banks will pass on the cost to depositors by reducing their interest rates,” he said.

But some say even Rs 5 lakh coverage is inadequate. “Even my maid had Rs 7 lakh in PMC as savings. They should be giving us 100% coverage. We are willing to pay a higher premium,” says Lavina Wadhwa (49), whose family, in aggregate, has Rs 1.3 crore stuck in PMC Bank in FDs and savings accounts.

“Look at the number of people and societies, including an RBI employees cooperative, which have lakhs of money with PMC Bank. How is Rs 5 lakh adequate?” asks Aarti Salgaonkar, a filmmaker and PMC bank depositor. A string of others like Bengaluru-based Sri Gururaghavendra Sahakara Bank , Niyamitha Cooperative Bank and Pune-based Shivajirao Bhosale Co-operative Bank have also been affected.

TOI spotted a board with Gurjar’s father’s name in Dallupura (inset). Gates to his house were shut.

NEW DELHI: There was a frenzy outside the Dallupura residence of Chowdhary Gaje Singh on Saturday evening. His son, Kapil Gurjar , had been arrested earlier in the day for firing three shots in the air at Shaheen Bagh , where an anti-citizenship law protest has been going on since December. Having recognised Gurjar from television news pictures, curious neighbours gathered outside the iron gates of the house in east Delhi .

Singh said he was at work when he discovered what his son had been up to on Saturday. “Kapil was at home till around noon when I left for office. It was at work that I got a phone call from a relative, asking me to check the news on television,” said Singh. “I was startled to see my son’s face on TV.”

Describing the 25-year-old as “straightforward” and “honest”, Singh said he hadn’t even seen him arguing with anyone earlier. He did note, however, that Gurjar wasn’t his normal self in recent days. “Chup chup sa raha karta tha kuch dino se, par ghar mein aisi kabhi koi baat hi nahi thi (he was unusually withdrawn these last few days, though there wasn’t anything at home that could have depressed him),” he revealed.

While the family does not have a political background, Singh has contested in municipal elections in the past as a candidate of the Bahujan Samaj Party. Residents of the locality said that the younger Gurjar had completed his schooling and enrolled for a journalism course, before dropping out. The youth handled the family’s dairy business.

A neighbour disclosed, “Kapil told us that the only problem he had with the Shaheen Bagh protest was that ambulances and vehicles were not allowed to pass through the area. Businesses are being disrupted and people are being inconvenienced and it could be that Kapil’s work too was getting impacted in this manner.”

Gurjar’s elder brother assumed he was somewhere nearby or was playing cricket in the vicinity at the time. He claimed the family did not possess a firearm. “We don’t know how Kapil ended up in Shaheen Bagh or how he got his hands on a pistol. We will find out once we talk to him,” he said.

Sachin Dedha, who is the young man’s gym partner, described Gurjar as a “nationalist”, but maintained that they seldom discussed topics like Shaheen Bagh in general. “He was like any other individual. We would talk about our daily lives and together work out at the gym. I know him well but he never confided in me about wanting to take such a drastic step,” said Dedha.

Joginder Nagar, Gurjar’s uncle, said the shooter was educated and so knew what was right and wrong. “He has a daughter who is almost two years old and a well-to-do family. Why would he take such a step? It seems like he is being set up,” said the circumspect Nagar.

A neighbour, Suryavanshi Indrajeet Gurjar, also testified to the 25-year-old’s familiarity with people in the area, with whom he was “never rude”. “He was a well-behaved man,” said Suryavanshi Gurjar. “He looked after the family dairy business and had no reason to lose his head like that. We are really surprised at his act, as surprised as everyone else.”

Nagpur: Entrepreneurs have welcomed the Union Budget presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday. They said the measures for start-ups will help boost India’s economic growth and promote skill development.

Deepak Menaria, founder and chief idea farmer at Lemon Ideas, said two things are really good in the Budget. “The seed fund for start-ups called ‘Early Life Funding’ will support ideation and development of entrepreneurship. At early stage, not much funding is available. They have announced it, so let us see what is the framework. Second is taxation. Making employee stock options (ESOPs) plan tax free will help start-ups to retain employees,” he said.

Menaria added that announcements on skill building will help MSMEs and start-ups so would the single window for investment clearance.

Rohan Parikh, director of The Green Acres Academy, said as a country gearing up to have the largest ‘working population’ in the age group of 15 to 65 years of age by 2030, Budget 2020 has adequately focused on building a robust structure to drive higher education and skill development. “From creating an efficient workforce of engineers, doctors, bio-medics and IT professionals to nurturing skill-based qualities for entrepreneurs, sales and marketing professionals or commercial fine arts etc, the Budget has taken into consideration the inclination of the youth and aligned it to the economic growth targets, thereby strengthening the role of education in building the $5 trillion economy,” he said.

Nilabh Kapoor, business head India, OLX People, said Union Budget 2020 is definitely a step towards boosting India’s economic growth. “The very first theme of the budget, ‘Aspirational India’, promises better livelihood for all, access to health care and greater job opportunities through education and skill development. The boost to entrepreneurship, start ups and skill development in the infrastructure sector is a welcome move that will help create jobs directly. A total of Rs3,000 crore has been allocated for skill development, which shows the government's commitment towards encouraging employment growth rate and boosting the skill sector,” he said.

Pramodh Chandrashekhar, founder CEO of Last Ripple, said the government has done credible work on start ups. But, Chandrashekhar felt, the allocation should have been 2 or 3 per cent more.

KOLKATA: The ‘ Kisan Rail ’ with refrigerated coaches that will be introduced by Indian Railways, as announced by the Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday, will provide a major boost to Bengal’s vegetable and horticulture sectors.

The coaches will be used for the transportation of perishable goods.

According to senior officials of the state agricultural marketing department, 18%-25% of the vegetables, fruits and flowers is wasted during transportation to other parts of the country. “At present, we send the produce via trucks where there is no facility to regulate temperature. Sometimes it takes more than a week to transport these perishable products. Naturally, the products become dry and farmers don’t get good value. Hence, they prefer selling it at a lower price in the local markets than send it to other places,” state agricultural advisor Pradip Majumdar said.

The FM in her budget speech announced that to build a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables, including milk, meat and fish, the Indian Railways will set up the ‘Kisan Rail’ through Public-private partnership arrangement. There shall be refrigerated coaches in express and freight trains as well.

The announcement comes at a time when Bengal has been recognized as the topmost vegetable-producing state in the country for 2018-19, bettering Uttar Pradesh. The state produced 29.55 million tonnes of vegetables during 2018-19, accounting for 15.9% of the country’s total vegetable production.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee had proposed a similar facility when she was the railway minister, but it was not successfully implemented.

Municipal commissioner Udit Agrawal (second from right) presenting the budget

Rajkot: It sounds bit far-fetched at present , but in the coming years travelling is set to become less troublesome for people of Rajkot. The city too is dreaming big, and in this decade could have metro train after Ahmedabad and Surat in Gujarat.

Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC), which presented Rs2,120 crore budget for financial year 2020-21 without imposing any new taxes or hiking rates on Saturday, proposes to appoint a consultant for metro train project. Municipal commissioner Udit Agrawal told reporters, ""The civic body proposes to appoint a consultant to carry out a feasibility study on the metro project in the city."" A provision of Rs1 crore has been made in the budget for the feasibility study. The size of the budget has got reduced compared to last year, but its focus remains on infrastructure projects and public transportation. The budget estimates find mentions of many schemes announced during the year and looks into the future ie 2030 when many nearby villages will be brought within the city limits. Once Hirasar airport and AIIMS become operational, it is but natural that the city limits will see further expansion toward Ahmedabad road and Jamnagar road.

RMC had last month notified merger of five surrounding villages with itself. RMC proposes to provide 24-hour water supply in ward numbers 1,8,9,10,11 and 12 for which it plans to approach Asian Development Bank (ADB) for loan. The project cost is Rs328 crore of which the portion of ADB loan will be 70 per cent. The remaining amount will be provided by the state government and the municipal corporation, which also plans to install water meters in the houses.

The civic body, which refrained from hiking tax rates in an election year, gave tax relief up to 25 per cent to self-financed schools, government buildings and banks. It proposes to form a special purpose vehicle for the administration of world-class Mahatma Museum.

RMC will be building an ebus depot for 50 ebuses at a cost of Rs10 crore as they are expected to be pushed into service later this year.

Some of the infrastructure projects proposed include two foot-on-bridges on 150-feet Ring Road, bridges on Ramapir Chowk, Nana Mauva Chowk, Umiya Chowk, Kalavad Road and Greenland Chowk. Those which are in tendering or construction stages include Dudhsagar Road Bridge, Amrapali railway underpass, Hospital Chowk flyover and Laxminagar underpass. Upon completion of all these projects, commuting will become a pleasant experience for people in the city.

Dehradun: Union Budget 2020 received a mixed response from the people of the state. TOI spoke to a cross-section of people including industrialists, educators, investment advisors and young professionals to gauge their reaction. City-based industrialist and chairman of Windlass Group, Sudhir Windlass said, “On the face of it, the proposal of affordable housing looks fine but there is a lot that needs to be done to accomplish the goal of housing for all.” Realtor Abhishek Bansal added, “Government's announcement of Rs 100 lakh crore for infrastructural development will boost real estate in tier II and tier III cities. There were many measures that we would have loved the government to address but announcement of infrastructure development is a step in right direction.”

Meanwhile, educators also welcomed the increase in allocation for the education sector from Rs 93,847 crore to Rs 99,300 crore (with Rs 3,000 crore for skill development).

Ajay Saksena, principal of DAV College, Dehradun , told TOI that “the thrust on online learning was a good thing but core- education colleges were totally neglected in the budget.”

“The government says that online degree courses will be offered by top 100 institutes of the country which is a good thing but there is no mention of employment generation, so one wonders what jobs students will get after doing the courses from such renowned universities,” he added.

City-based investment advisor Sunil Mittal said that “a big put- off for the industry is the silence in the budget on the provision of long term capital gain tax (10%).”

Gaurav Mehta, a Doon-based filmmaker, said,“With no major polls in sight — except the Delhi assembly elections — the government could really have announced a major rejig even if it had come at the cost of upsetting some people. What makes promises in the budget less credible is what happened last year when the finance minister rolled back a couple of announcements post-budget.”

Hyderabad: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has instructed officials to take advantage of the barrages and reservoirs constructed as part of Kaleshwaram and develop tourism spots all over the state.

He asked the officials to identify places conducive for tourism and prepare plans to develop them. The CM said this at a review meeting on tourism at Pragathi Bhavan on Saturday.

“ There is a dense forest area on either side of the Godavari river. Boating facilities can be provided. Trees can be grown on either side on the lines of Dal lake in Srinagar.

The FM’s proposal to hike fiscal deficit, to indirectly indicate keeping small savings rates at an elevated level and less incentive for life insurers to buy government securities would keep the long term government yields at an elevated level. This, in turn, would leave less option for RBI to cut rates in the short term, bond market players said. However, given the limited options that the finance minister had to manoeuvre with the Budget numbers, they feel the government has aimed at boosting “growth through acceptable level of fiscal expansion and funding the same through higher small savings collection thereby avoiding crowding out,” said Ram Kamal Samanta , VP-Investment, Star Union Dai-ichi Life Insurance.

It being a Saturday, with the bond market closed for trading, dealers will await Monday’s trading session to gauge the full impact of the Budget proposals.

Bond market players also feel that with economic recovery funded through fiscal expansion, it may exert some pressure on interest rates, which in turn is likely to be contained by accommodative policy stance by the RBI and resumption of FPI buying of Indian bonds owing to the extension of lower withholding tax facility.

NEW DELHI: Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union ( JNUSU ) has announced that the students will head to Shaheen Bagh to protect and join the protesters after another person opened fire in the area on Saturday.

In their statement, JNUSU said, “There are reports of another firing incident from Shaheen Bagh. A man fired at the protesters in front of police barricades. This is the second recent incident in a disturbing trend of targeting protesters through the use of violence. A Jamia student was injured only two days ago.”

They blamed Union minister Anurag Thakur for allegedly exhorting supporters to take the law into their hands and also alleged that BJP’s Model Town candidate Kapil Mishra and UP CM Yogi Adityanath are “repeatedly making anti-Muslim remarks that are being used as fodder for intensification of a violent campaign so close to elections.”

Attacking Delhi Police for being “mute spectators”, Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union “condemned the partisan attitude of the police” and demanded urgent action to stop such attacks.

Calling the student community to assemble at Shaheen Bagh, JNUSU said in its statement that “we appeal the student community to rally in support of Shaheen Bagh against the anti-people CAA-NRC-NPR and join.”

Announcing support for protesters at Shaheen Bagh, JNU’s NSUI unit called for an effigy burning of the RSS at Sabarmati lawns of the university campus.

285,['2/02/2020'],"Shaheen Bagh protests: Centre ready for structured dialogue, says Union minister","This story is from February 2, 2020

Ravi Shankar Prasad

NEW DELHI: Amid growing tension over anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh , the central government said it was ready to clarify the “doubts” of protesters on changes in Citizenship Amendment Act if they came forward for a formal engagement.

“Government is ready to talk to protesters at Shaheen Bagh, but then it should be in a structured form and the Narendra Modi government is ready to communicate with them and clear all the doubts they have against CAA,” Union law and communications minister Ravi Shankar Prasad tweeted.

Sources said the tweet was a follow-up of a statement that Prasad had made in response to a question put to him in a TV debate a couple of days ago, but nobody from Shaheen Bagh had come forward. The scope of any such talk would be limited to clearing misgivings which, according to them, have been stoked to fuel the protests. “Any change in CAA is not on the table,” a source said.

Prasad told TOI, “We are a sensitive government and will like to engage with the protesters to clear their doubts provided they approach us for formal talks.”

In the TV debate, a person associated with the Shaheen Bagh agitation asked Prasad why the government had not talked to protesters yet. The minister welcomed the suggestion as a “good thing”, given that the agitators ruled out talks with the government unless changes in the citizenship law were reversed.

However, Prasad made it clear that the protesters would have to reach out to the government. “If you want a government representative to talk, then there should be a structured request from Shaheen Bagh that says all people there want to talk on the subject,” he said. He ruled out the idea of a government representative visiting the protest site. “What if someone goes there and is mistreated?” he asked.

287,['2/02/2020'],Shaheen Bagh protest: Women say they aren’t budging,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Shaheen Bagh Twitter handle said the protesters would not be deterred.

NEW DELHI: It was usual business at Shaheen Bagh when an armed man opened fire a few metres away from the tent, which has turned home to several thousand women for the past 49 days.

A contingent of Sikh speakers from Punjab was on the mic, calling for unity, when the sound of gunshots pierced the air around 5pm on Saturday.

The seconds after it were a blur as several women scrambled out of the tent. They walked in the direction of the shooter, unaware of the danger, but also unafraid. When they found out what had happened, their response was measured but strong. They formed a human chain at the shooting spot.

When TOI visited the site, the women were standing together, holding hands, supporting the elderly, and aiding the men in their vigil, wary of strangers in the area. Some of them also offered namaz on the road, praying for “peace and solidarity”. But Shaheen Bagh’s collective answer to the gunman who shouted “only Hindus will rule India” was the national anthem and chants of Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Isayi, apas mein hain bhai bhai.

“We know these are attempts to scare away the protesters, especially ahead of the assembly elections. But we will not budge,” said Iqra, who reached the spot just minutes after the shooting.

The young woman also questioned the police’s inability to catch the perpetrators. “The entrance to the area from Jasola Vihar Metro Station is blocked at two points. The shooter had crossed the first layer of the barricades and fired in the air a few metres away from the main stage. How has this become so normal?” she asked.

Razia, a 70-year-old woman, clutching the hand of her daughter-in-law, was an image of determination. Her frail body was bent, but she put herself in the frontline. “I have been sitting in the tent for over a month. But I came here 2 hours ago when I heard about the shooting. We are not scared of the bullets and will always be the first in the line of defence against the divisive forces,” she said.

Around 7.30pm, the official Twitter handle of the protest site also issued an appeal. “The women of #shaheenbagh call for urgent mobilisation for 2nd February 2020. We will not be deterred by threats from Right-Wing groups in our fight to protect the Constitution. Please join us (sic),” it said. The appeal also pointed to the “unverified” threats that have been posted on several social media platforms, where people claiming to be from the Hindu Sena said they would “clear” the Shaheen Bagh road on February 2.

Upasana, a resident of Bijnor who came to Delhi to join the protest on January 19, questioned the people in power, “The ministers keep calling for traitors to be shot. I’d like to ask them who’s a traitor? Those who sit peacefully in protests, or those who incite violence?” she asked.

On Sunday, the sit-in at Shaheen Bagh will enter the 50th day. The shooting did ruffle feathers, especially as it came just two days after a student of Jamia Millia Islamia was shot at a few kilometres away from the neighbourhood. But the women’s resolve remained unshakeable. As a protester articulated, the women are alert about the possibility of trouble, but are not “troubled” by it.

RAJKOT: A tribal man was murdered in Khakhara Bela village of Padadhari taluka in Rajkot district on Thursday night. A complaint in this connection was lodged with Padadhari police station on Friday night.

Police said the victim’s brother-in-law and the latter’s brother strangled Kailash Mavi (35) on the outskirts of Khakhara Bela village. The accused have been identified as Raju Mahida and Kaju Mahida, sad cops.

The next morning on Friday, one Vanrajsinh Jadeja came asking for Mavi for some labour work. Savita went to the farm to look for Mavi and found him dead,” said J V Vadhiya, sub-inspector with Padadhari police station.

KOLHAPUR: A meeting organised by the Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries saw a diverse analysis of the Union Budget 2020 . Representatives from many sectors were part of the meet.

“The real issues pertaining to the two core sectors — agriculture and industry — have been addressed in the budget. There should have been emphasis on measures to be adopted to increase jobs,” said economist Vijay Kakade.

“There is a need to spend more on projects that will generate employment while at the same time improving spending capacity. Also, taxes continue to be high for small-scale industries and co-operative industries. The co-operative sector, which comprises credit societies and the factories, have not been mentioned in the budget apart from a tax rate cut from 30% to 22%,” he said.

Anand Mane, an industrialist, said: “The government is not ready to accept that there has been an unprecedented slowdown. The proposed 16-point programme will most likely turn out to be a dream instead of a reality. The announcement made to increase farmers’ incomes to double by 2022, has not been supported by any plan. The banks are not ready to lend. The only thing industrialists can do now is to ensure that the businesses don’t suffer high losses in the coming months.”

Chandrakant Jadhav, the vice-president of the KCCI and a Congress MLA, said: “Problems have been rising in the industrial sector. A lack of concrete policies is causing losses. There was no big announcement on infrastructure, which has the potential to create jobs. We have no data that tells us how much was spent on infrastructure last year. We believe that the job crisis is going to worsen. We have sought a meeting with Union ministers, to ask for policies that could also boost the automobile sector. The official life span of vehicles should be cut down to 10 years from the existing 15 years.”

Tax consultant Mahesh Dharmadhikari said the government has given relief to the tax payers by cutting down the income tax, however, at the same time the deductions or the tax exemptions are done away with.

292,['2/02/2020'],Existing textile units in Maharashtra hang by a thread,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Production has dropped drastically over the past few years

PUNE: The Union Budget 2020 has announced Rs 1,480 crore, over four years, for the National Technical Textile Mission to cut down imports. However, the industry rued the lack of impetus to the existing textile units that are struggling to survive.

Ichalkaranji, Bhiwandi and Malegaon are the textile hubs of Maharashtra, where cloth is produced using cotton grown in the Vidarbha and Marathwada regions. According to industry experts, there are approximately 10 lakh textile units across the state, with over 50 lakh people dependent on them.

Ichalkaranji town, which is known as the Manchester of Maharashtra, has a daily production of 1.25 crore metre of cloth through its powerloom units. The market value of this fabric is Rs 50-55 crore. The production has dropped drastically over the past few years, but even the low volume of produce is failing to find market, said Satish Koshti, the president of Ichalkaranji Powerloom Weavers Cooperative Association Limited.

Koshti told TOI that fabrics and garments manufactured in Ichalkaranji were failing to find market due to greater imports from Bangladesh. “Earlier, Kolkata was a prominent markets for us. Now, that market has been captured by the Bangladesh-based industries,” he said.

There are about 20,000 powerlooms in the lanes and bylanes of Malegaon city, which employ nearly 1 lakh people. The industry has been going through a lean phase due to the rise in power tariff, demonetization, GST, and drop in demand for the material manufactured. Koshti said the textile industry needs an immediate push for revival. “It is a dire situation for us. Ichalkaranji hosts around 1.25 lakh powerloom units at present, while around 20,000 to 25,000 units have been shut down due to the losses in the past four years,” he said.

The textile unit associations have been raising their concerns with the state and Union governments, but there has been little response. “Today’s Budget too did not paint an enthusiastic picture,” Koshti said. He said the revision of power tariffs, partial clearance of loans are some of the immediate steps that the governments should take to bail out the industry. “The floods last year also damaged a few thousand units in Ichalkaranji and weavers need to get compensation,” he said.

Prakash Awade, Independent MLA from Ichalkaranji, said the Union government had shown inclination to support technical textile, but it needs to make better provisions for the existing industry.

Kottayam: Five members of a family were killed after the car they were travelling in rammed into a truck near Kuravilangad in the wee hours of Saturday. Their funeral will be held at the SNDP crematorium in Veloor at 11am on Sunday. In the accident which occurred around 12.15am, Ulattilpadi Thambi (68), a native of Thiruvathukkal, his wife Valsala (65), daughter-in-law Prabha (40), grandson Arjun (19), and Prabha’s mother Usha Thomas (55), were killed in the accident. Prabha’s husband Praveen who is working in Kuwait reached home on Saturday evening.

The family had gone to Sree Subramanya Swami temple in Chalakkudy to attend the debut Bharatanatyam stage performance of Thambi’s grandniece. The accident happened on their return from the temple. According to MVD’s primary report, Arjun, who was driving the car, might have dozed off, leading to the accident. The speeding car crossed the middle line and went to the opposite side of the road and rammed head on into the oncoming truck. The car was totally destroyed in the crash and all five died on the spot. Local residents rushed to the spot on hearing the sound and launched rescue operations. Traffic along MC Road was disrupted for over an hour following the accident.

Praveen is working in an automobile dealership in Kuwait. Earlier, the family were living with him there. His wife Prabha and son Arjun had returned to Kottayam for the latter’s education purpose. Thambi’s daughter Indulekha, who is also abroad, will be arriving home by Sunday morning. The bodies are kept in the morgue of Government Medical College hospital. The bodies will be brought home by 8am.

Meanwhile, the MVD have come to a primary conclusion that careless driving led to the accident. Arjun, who was not used to driving at night time, might have dozed off. The car was moving at a speed exceeding 100km/hr at the time of the accident.

CHENNAI: The Union government’s push for clean energy may put the state power utility, Tangedco, in trouble as it may have to decommission a clutch of its thermal units with an installed capacity of 1,850MW, which is nearly 50% of the total installed capacity of thermal power units in the state.The total installed capacity of thermal units in the state is 4,320MW.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her budget speech on Saturday, said that old thermal power plants with high carbon emission levels must be decommissioned.Though the Centre is yet to define the age or emission levels that may be set for decommissioning such plants, five units in Tuticorin and four units in Mettur may have to be shut as all these units are at least 20 to 30 years old. It would be difficult to make these plants emission compliant, a senior state government official said.If the state loses these units, it may have to buy electricity from power exchanges --- which would add to the state’s financial burden.“For thermal power plants that are old and whose carbon emission levels are high, we propose that utilities running them would be advised to close them if their emission is above the pre-set norms. The land so vacated can be put to alternative use,” the finance minister said on Friday.Tangedco officials, however, denied the units were pollutants and said that with some retro-fitments, the units could continue to run for another decade or two.In 2016, Tamil Nadu decommissioned 450MW capacity units in Ennore which were the oldest thermal units in the state. “Power generation in these units commissioned between 1970 and 1975 has been stopped, and a new 660MW thermal unit is being commissioned. Work is going on,” a Tangedco official said.The Tuticorin units were commissioned between 1979 and 1991 in stages, while Mettur units were set up between 1987 and 1990.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73868194,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-94485,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/centres-green-norms-for-old-units-tn-may-lose-50-thermal-power/articleshow/73854915.cms

AURANGABAD: Officials from the water works department of the civic administration said that the water supply to the city and the Cidco areas would be affected on account of a burst in the pipe at the New Pharola pump house on Saturday afternoon.

According to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), a 350mm pipe connected to the pumphouse supplying 100 million litre per day (100 MLD) at Pharola water purification centre tore open at 3.40pm on Saturday. The pipe that was damaged is connected to the 1,219mm main pipeline, which brings water to the city. As the welded pipe broke open, water splashed over the electric motor, panel and other electrical equipment, affecting their operations. The water supply had to be immediately disconnected.

The AMC stated in a release that the 100 MLD water scheme had to be closed for a minimum of 24 hours to repair the pipe, motor and the panel. Pumping from Jayakwadi was also stopped for the 100 MLD scheme. The civic staff immediately began the repair works. The water supply to the city will be stopped for 24 hours.

Municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey said that the work of drying the panels and the motor pumps have started. “Until the repair is completed, there will be no supply to the city. However, Cidco areas will continue receiving water supply.”

Citizens, who were expecting water supply on Sunday, will have to wait for another day. As it is, water is supplied once in six to seven days.

The city receives water through a 100 MLD scheme laid in 1991 and a 56 MLD scheme laid in 1984. According to the water works department, the 56 MLD scheme has already become obsolete. Once the new water supply scheme is implemented, the 56 MLD scheme will be closed.

Hyderabad: Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT) leader and social worker Amjed Ullah Khan has written a letter to union external affairs minister, S Jaishankar about his Twitter account being blocked by the Indian embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

In the letter, Khan explained that he had been highlighting the issues being faced by NRIs through his social media and had helped rescue a number of women and men stuck overseas.

In the past, Khan has highlighted the plight of Indians in distress in the Gulf. The embassy had taken notice of it to help those in distress several times. “Most of the cases pertain to the Gulf, especially to Saudi Arabia. I have been highlighting their problems through my Twitter account (@amjedmbt) and I was shocked to see that Indian Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia has blocked my Twitter account. Kindly inquire whether this act has been done intentionally to appease my political opponents or by mistake,” he said.

“Blocking anyone on official Twitter account is a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution of India and curbs me from raising issues to solve problems,” he said. Khan also marked a copy of the letter to Dr Ausaf Sayeed, Indian ambassador to Saudi Arabia.

Chandrasekhar Azad

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Bhim Army chief Chandrasekhar Azad on Saturday said the fight against the draconian law will continue until the government withdraws the Act or till the Prime Minister and home minister resigns.

Addressing thousands of protesters who joined a march against Citizenship (Amendment) Act to Raj Bhavan organised by SDPI here on Saturday, Azad said nobody should be sent to detention camps.

According to Azad, the protest by sisters, like in Shaheen bagh , is happening in different parts of the country. “The government which is afraid of democratic protest is coming up with agendas to destroy the peaceful protest. They want the protests to be violent. We should go ahead with peaceful protest by using the privileges granted by the judiciary and Constitution. The last win will be ours,” said Azad.

Exhorting people to defend the Constitution till their last breath, Azad asked all participants to take a pledge that they would defend the Constitution. He read out the preamble of the Constitution and asked each of the participant to repeat his words before starting the speech.

The march from East Fort to Raj Bhavan which was the culmination of Kerala march organised by SDPI was inaugurated by national president M K Faizi. State president P Abdul Majeed Faizi presided over.

Chandrasekhar Azad will address a protest gathering at Kodungallur on Sunday before leaving for New Delhi.

PUNE: Good food, live music and a steady flow of beverages ensured Puneites had a great time at The Times of India Green Dot Gourmet Food Fest. A first-of-its-kind vegetarian food festival, Green Dot received an overwhelming response on the opening day.

The afternoon heat on Saturday failed to dampen the spirit of food lovers, who thronged Vrindavan Lawns at Baner Road to indulge in an assortment of vegetarian fare. The crowd only further swelled as the sun began to set, lending the lawn a carnival atmosphere. Live music by popular bands Malang and Fidelity kept the crowds entertained through the evening.

Food blogger Mrunmai Naikwadi said, “I am a vegetarian and I was very excited to visit Green Dot. Every cuisine has been covered here, with dishes ranging for basic vegetarian fare to some that aren’t easily available in Pune. The Bamboo Biryani and Soya Chaap were the highlight. I loved the experience and hope that more vegetarian food festivals are organized in the city. Such festivals will surely draw a lot of people as many from the city are turning vegetarian or vegan.”

Indian and international cuisines were on offer at nearly 30 stalls, including North Indian, South Indian, Indian street food, Maharashtrian, Rajasthani, Bihari, Italian, Mexican, Shawarma and much more.

The Bamboo Biryani, served by Kolhapuri Tadka, was among the showstopping dishes at the festival. Food blogger Ruchi Parekh said, “This is a new concept and I have never seen it before. The rice is filled into a hollow bamboo stick and covered using aluminium foil. The bamboo is then left to cook on charcoal. The charcoal gave the biryani a slightly smoky flavour and enhances the spices.”

Wood-fired pizzas on offer by the food truck Fire Wheels also wowed a number of patrons. “We serve only vegetarian wood-fired pizzas and are generally stationed near Blue Ridge Society at Hinjewadi. We came prepared to dish out at least 150 pizzas in three different sizes for the first day,” said Suraj Vishwasrao, owner of the food truck.

The festival also had a mixology session by Chef Gopi of Lemon Tree. A masterclass on Oriental food by Baan Tao left people spell bound. The Raw Papaya Salad prepared during the masterclass was a hit among patrons witnessing the preparations.

The Times of India Green Dot Gourmet Food Fest is powered by VTP Realty and curated by Pune Eat Outs associate sponsors are Girikand Holidays and Ranka Jewellers.

Times Green Dot Gourmet Food Fest is on at Vrindavan Lawns, Baner Road, from 11am to 10pm

Pune Municipal Corporation

PUNE: The civic body has decided not to wait beyond seven days for a no objection certificate ( NOC ) from the traffic police for commissioning infrastructure projects on city roads.

The Pune Municipal Corporation ( PMC ), in a recent circular, instructed various departments to start the physical work of a proposed projects seven days after furnishing relevant details to the traffic police.

The civic administration said the decision was taken to avoid “unnecessary delays” while executing various infrastructure projects that required digging of roads, a PMC official said.

The corporators have been urging the administration to revise the existing guidelines related to the execution of the infrastructure projects. “Corporators cutting across party lines had during a recent general body meeting expressed concerns over the delays in execution of infrastructure projects because of non-availability the NOCs from the traffic police,” an official said.

PMC sources said it was not mandatory for the civic administration to wait for the NOCs from the traffic police to start the projects. “Until now, the administration was seeking NOCs to ensure coordination and avoid citizens’ hardships. But there have been inordinate delays in getting permission from the traffic police,” a source said.

Another PMC official said, “Heads of departments such as water supply, road development, special projects and drainage are now expected to submit details of the proposed projects, their maps, possible changes in traffic movement during such work, road digging and security plans to the zonal officers concerned of the traffic department. The departments are expected to execute the measures and start the physical work of a project after seven days from the date of submitting the plan to the traffic police.”

A senior corporator said the new arrangement was expected to streamline the civic projects and reduce people’s hardships because of factors such as road closures.

AURANGABAD: The detection branch of Jinsi police have arrested three suspects, including a couple, for allegedly running an inter-state human trafficking racket that would lure gullible women on the pretext of employment with food catering services and sell them to men for marriage.

One of the suspects has been identified as Yogesh Kailash Borse, a resident of Sanjaynagar area of the city. The accused trio would be produced in a local court on Sunday.

Police said the offence was registered on Friday after a 40-year-old woman approached them saying she was sold to a man in Gujarat in 2017.

Jinsi police station’s senior inspector Vyankatesh Kendre said the suspects appear to be habitual offenders and probably would have sold several women on similar pretext.

“In this case, the suspects reached out to the woman, who is a widow, and offered her a job in catering service. They took her to Gujarat in 2017 and sold her to a man who forcefully married her.”

Worried about her teenaged daughter left behind in Aurangabad, the woman recently got her 16-year-old daughter to come to Gujarat and stay with her.

“The man, who forcefully married the widow, allegedly raped her 16-year-old daughter as well. Upon learning about it, the woman, along with her daughter, fled from Gujarat and reached Aurangabad. She later lodged a complaint with us,” Kendre said.

Based on the woman’s complaint, the suspects, including the man from Guajarat, have been booked on the charges of kidnapping for marriage, human trafficking, rape and criminal conspiracy.

In addition, the suspects have also been slapped with sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).

The incident came to light only after the woman and her daughter approached the police. It was after carrying out medical test of the victims and recording their statements, the offence came to be registered around Friday midnight.

Sources said the police are collecting details about the suspects in the areas they live to get more clues about their activities.

Chennai: As per the Union finance ministry’s data based on the 2020-2021 Budget , Tamil Nadu is expected to receive Rs 32,849.34 crore as part of its tax share from the Centre.

While Tamil Nadu’s share of the corporate tax for the new fiscal year will be Rs.10,104 crore -- Rs.1,193 crore more compared to last year--- it’s share of income tax will go up by Rs 1,291 crore. The income tax share of the state for the new financial year will be Rs 9,395 crore.

“As per the data, the state is expected to receive nearly Rs.6,000 crore more compared to last year. But the actual accrual may be less as there will be adjustments under CGST (Central Goods and Services Tax),” said a senior state finance department official.

""Maximum share of tax revenue for the state comes from corporate tax followed by CGST. Income tax and central excise are the other revenue sources for the states from the Centre,” said the official.

“GST revenue may increase more than what has been estimated in the budget. At present, the GST revenue collection is low, but once the economic picks up pace, we expect revenue collection to go up,” the official added.

AURANGABAD: As the Jayakwadi bird sanctuary is yet to be considered a Ramsar site, experts have highlighted the importance of flocks of flamingos that arrive at Nathsagar during every winter season.

Nature expert Kishor Pathak said that flamingos feed on algae which only develops in wetlands, striking down the claims made by a section of forest official that Jayakwadi has deep waters and cannot be termed wetland. Flocks of flamingos and other migratory birds visit Jayakwadi bird sanctuary every year.

“The algae can grow in water bodies where sunlight penetrates to the bottom and facilitates photosynthesis. These habitats can be scientifically referred to as ideal wetlands,” he said.

On the occasion of World Wetlands Day on February 2, experts have pitched for inclusion of Jayakwadi bird sanctuary into the list of Ramsar sites.

“Jayakwadi bird sanctuary is rich not only in terms of population but also diversity of birds. Even Nandur Madhyameshwar bird sanctuary, which has received the Ramsar tag, is no match to Jayakwadi when it comes to the population of flamingos and other birds,” environmentalist Milind Giridhari said.

The Ramsar convention in 1971 defined wetlands as areas where water is the primary factor which controls the environment and the associated plant and animal life.

When contacted, a senior forest department official said Jayakwadi sanctuary was one of the shortlisted sites, when the proposal for Ramsar sites from Maharashtra was sent to the Convention on Wetlands called the Ramsar Convention.

“Parts of Jayakwadi sanctuary is a large wetland. However, the sanctuary has deep waters as we move from the banks of the reservoir towards the spillway,” he said, preferring anonymity. Forest department officials also said that Jayakwadi bird sanctuary was still in the race for Ramsar site.

He was immediately rushed to the Government Medical College and Hospital. He was discharged after getting the first aid. Following which, an offence was registered against him with the Begumpura police station, for attempting suicide.

Old Mint

KOLKATA: The museum of trade and numismatics at Old Mint, which had been planned in early 90s but is yet to see the light of day, now seems to be with the realm of possibility with Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman mentioning about its allocation in her Budget speech on Saturday. Sitharaman on Saturday also mentioned about renovation of Indian Museum.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sowed the hopes of a complete metamorphosis of Indian Museum during his last visit to the city.

The majestic Old Mint was built in Grecian Doric style, and according to Evan Cotton , city’s most well-known chronicler, “the central portico facing the Strand was a copy of the Temple of Minerva at Athens”. Today, a tall wall of corrugated metal sheet hide the massive portico with 40 massive columns from the sight of passers-by at Posta.

The mint, located at the heart of Eastern India’s biggest trading hub, will be an ideal place for a museum because of the city’s long association with the modern currency system. The first mint of the country was built in the city inside the Old Fort William (now GPO). The Old Currency Building is where India’s first Reserve Bank operated from, said a historian.

In fact, two mints functioned there — the Silver opened in 1831 and the Copper in 1865. A PWD register recorded the value of the silver mint and bullion vault at Rs 7,35,776. It was one of the busiest mints in the world and records show that in December 1918, it produced 1,900,00 coins in one day, a world record.

Indian Museum, which underwent renovation DURING its bicentenary celebrations in 2014, has started showing signs of decay. The leaking roof and crumbling plaster paint a sorry picture. For ages, the exhibits (less than 4% of its total collection) have remained the same, though it has a massive treasure trove of Indian heritage lying as its reserve collection.

KOLKATA: Railway officials said they would have been relieved had finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman mentioned Metro projects in Kolkata even once during her Budget speech.

“All the Metro projects in Kolkata are overdue. Neither lack of funds nor the railways is to blame for the delay, but a mention would have shown the Centre’s intent to complete them at the earliest,” a railway official said. “Bengaluru people must have felt happy when Sitharaman mentioned the Rs 18,600-crore 148km-long suburban transport project, which is important to decongest the southern city. Metro projects here are essential for faster commute. We will have to wait till Wednesday for details on the projects.”

Kolkata has five ongoing projects, two of which are nearing completion. The Metro link, which is expected to complete first is between Noapara and Dakshineswar, which will add the northern suburbs to the existing network. It will be a boon for thousands of people living in Dakshineswar, Baranagar and the Dunlop crossing, already suffering due to the closure of the Tallah Bridge. The airport link from Noapara is also nearing completion and work is in full swing for the underground yard at the Kolkata airport that promises to be the largest in the country. The airport route will be a stepping stone for the Metro’s progress towards Barasat.

“Phase-I of the East-West Metro between Sector V and Salt Lake stadium is ready and awaiting inauguration. We had expected a mention of it in the Budget speech. The cost for Phase-II between Salt Lake stadium and Howrah Maidan has also gone up due to subsidence at Bowbazar. We are waiting to see how much is allocated for the E-W Metro this year as expenses are likely to be more in 2020-21. Work for the New Garia-Airport stretch is progressing at a good pace now,” another official said.

The Joka-BBD Bag link is probably the most worrisome. Thanks to delay in land acquisition, it has not seen as much progress as it should have in the 10-odd years after its foundation was laid. The biggest hurdle for the project is non-availability of land for the Joka carshed and encroachments along the way. While 85% of the land has been acquired for the depot, work can’t start till the rest 15% are available.

KOLKATA: Saturday’s Budget left the middle-class Bengalis confused as they failed to conclude if they had gained or lost anything. Tax consultants started getting calls about this new puzzle — new slab with no deduction in personal tax or existing slab with all the deductions in tax.

Arvind Agarwal of GP Agarwal & Associate felt there was a big catch in the new tax proposal. “I personally feel the relief will be marginal but for those who are in higher slabs would get more benefit in the new regime ,” he said.

Incidentally, in the new regime, there will be no deductions for housing loan, insurance, PPF or health insurance. “Lot of people here invests in LIC. They have to take a call. There will be no leave travel allowance provision in the new regime. Considering the fact that Bengalis love to travel, this has to be taken into consideration,” he added.

According to N G Khaitan, partner of Khaitan & Company, most people with an annual income of Rs 15 lakh will opt for the new scheme. “If you see the slabs, only if one with Rs 15 lakh income can bring down his income through deductions below Rs 10 lakh will it make sense for them to remain in the old scheme,” he explained.

Leading tax consultant J S Vanzara welcomed the changes in individual tax rates. “It benefits all as many individuals may not qualify for the exemptions or deductions. So lower taxes is welcome for them,” he said. Another tax consultant, Kumarjit Das, was a bit critical about the new regime.

“High-income group will mainly benefit from the Budget announcement. The government has tried to form a Pareto efficient tax regime but in this era of stagflation, this may not be successful and may also create social insecurities,” he said.

Haridwar/Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorism Squad (UPATS) on Saturday arrested one Ashish Singh, a key arms supplier of Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), from Haridwar. ATS is now probing his supply channel and chains in Uttar Pradesh.

Confirming the development, Haridwar senior superintendent of police Senthil Abudai Krishna Raj S told TOI, “A wanted criminal was arrested from the Civil Line police station area in Roorkee by the UP ATS on Saturday. UP ATS has informed us about the operation and the accused was hiding in his relative’s home.”

An ATS official said that Singh has been accused in a number of cases, including attempt to murder, rioting with deadly weapons, criminal conspiracy and harbouring offender from Punjab in 2018.

Information about Singh’s movement was shared by Punjab police and passed on to UP ATS last week. An ATS official privy to the investigation said that Singh is considered to be the right hand of Gugni Grewal aka Harmeet Singh chief of KLF and a supplier of weapons to the force. Singh also has a role in the murder of RSS and Shiv Sena worker. He added that after the murder of KLF chief on January 27, 2020, in Pakistan, Punjab police traced one Sukhpreet Singh of Monga in Punjab. Later, on his identification Singh was traced.

ADG ATS DK Thakur said that Singh was named in other cases, including illegal sale of liquor. “He came in touch with KLF chief while he was in Patiala jail. Singh had also supplied 10 pistols of various bores to KLF chief. We are tracing Singh’s links and his channel of procurement of weapons,” he said, adding that a hunt is on to locate his associates in Uttar Pradesh.

Sources said that his call details have been scanned and it also revealed some numbers from Pakistan.

Pune: The Chandannagar police on Friday booked a man from Yerawada on the charges of duping a finance company of Rs6 lakh by not repaying the loan he had taken to buy a multi-utility vehicle (MUV) and selling the impounded car to several people across the state.

The police said the man, aged around 33, was booked following a complaint registered by Dada Shaikh (40) of Wagholi working with the finance firm as an officer.

“The man had taken the loan from the finance company’s Yerawada office in May 2011 and purchased the MUV. He paid the equated monthly instalment (EMI) for the first few months and then discontinued. After a few months, the finance company impounded the vehicle. But the man managed to take it away on the promise of repaying the loan,” an officer from the Chandannagar police said.

The officer said the man then put up a number plate bearing the registration number of the Beed RTO and also obtained a no objection certificate (NOC) from the office. “We suspect he had secured the NOC by submitting fake documents. He has since taken money from several people across the state on the pretext of selling the car, but never delivered it,” the officer said.

The officer said the complaint was lodged on Friday after the finance company traced the vehicle to Beed district, nearly after nine years.

“They are in the process of seizing the vehicle. Our investigation is also on” the officer added.

Padmavati said that these comments were made to mentally torture her and assassinate her character

HARIDWAR: Seer Padmavati has slapped Rs 100 crore notice on two Doon Hospital doctors who allegedly said that she is two-month pregnant. The statements were allegedly made when she was forcibly taken to the hospital by city police for a check-up on Thursday night.

She claimed that Dr Vijay Bhandari, who attended her, said that she was vomiting due to pregnancy and CMO Meenakshi Joshi accused her of not leading a celibate life despite being a sadhvi. Padmavati said that these comments were made to mentally torture her and assassinate her character.

“Padmavati has been fasting for nearly two months and no urine test proved her pregnancy. So, how can her pregnancy report come positive all of a sudden,” asked Swami Shivanand Saraswati, head of Matri Sadan. Padmavati’s notice gives seven days to the doctors to either plead guilty or face legal action.

Meanwhile, both the doctors claimed they made no such accusations. “Her mensuration cycle was irregular. So, a pregnancy test had to be done to rule out its possibility. But no one said anything even close to what she is claiming. The entire incident has been video-taped,” said Dehradun CMO Meenakshi Joshi.

Dr Bhandari also denied making any such statement. “I did not say anything related to her pregnancy and she was treated like any other patient,” said Bhandari.

NEW DELHI: Income tax rates have been lowered but the salaried class appears confused over two parallel tax slab structures . Taxpayers are apprehensive about the possible rebates in the new regime. TOI spoke to a cross-section of people in the capital to gauge their mood about the Union Budget and its key provisions.Rejimon CK from Dwarka said the Budget will put additional burden on the salaried and the middle class. “People were initially happy on hearing about the lower tax rates, but their joy didn’t last long due to the removal of exemptions. They are going back to the old slabs that have exemptions. They may be talking about no harassment tax charter, but in reality inspectors have to be dealt with,” he added.The Dwarka resident also wanted the government to declare the amount of tax being paid by people indirectly through Goods and Services Tax. “People will prefer the old system rather than taking a risk,” he said.Ratnesh Tiwari, 40, a stockbroker at Barakhamba Road, said that while the market was expecting radical reforms, the Budget did not offer many reasons to cheer about. “Besides re-jigging of tax slabs, there is nothing new in it to boost the country’s economic growth. The economy will more or less continue on the same trajectory,” he added.Faizullah Ahrar, 43, who also works in the financial sector, said that two parallel tax structures will lead to several complications. “This will do more harm than good as far as simplifying the tax structure is concerned. Removal of exemptions might even nullify the tax cuts,” he added.“The government says that people should be able to file taxes without any hassles. But the taxpayers will now have to run to chartered accountants for clarity on exemptions. No big announcement for Delhi was disappointing,” Krishna Nagar resident BS Vohra said, adding that the Budget should have also addressed the pollution concerns.Sanjay Bhargav, head of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal, however, said the infrastructure push may provide the necessary impetus for the revival of economy. “If money is spent on infrastructure, the whole cycle will get rejuvenated as more cash will flow into the market,” he said.The women TOI spoke to were not too optimistic about the benefits of the allocated funds reaching them. “We as women do not feel safe in the city. The Budget is only a gimmick for the government to gather additional votes. No matter how much money is allotted for women’s security, nothing much will change on the ground,” said Manju, a banker.Her colleague, Poonam, said, “We were in office when we heard the Budget speech. There was nobody who was much satisfied with it. The taxpayers are now confused as the slabs have been mixed up. We will have to study them in depth.”However, the increased allocation for the health sector was appreciated by people. “There is a lot that needs to be done to improve the health sector. Hopefully, some changes might be made with the increased budgetary allocation,” said SK Bakshi, a working professional.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73867901,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-151727,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/people-find-new-it-regime-taxing-but-infra-and-health-are-bright-spots/articleshow/73855018.cms

Kozhikode: Hindu Dharma Samrakshana Samithi will organize a day-long fasting at Mukkam on Monday to protest against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which is ‘divisive’ in nature.

Kapyedath Chandran, chairman of the Samithi, said that the fasting is being organized to dispel the notion that all Hindus support CAA. “In fact, majority in the community is against the Act that divides the people of the country. Plurality is the basis of Indian culture as evident in different verses from the Vedas,” Chandran said.

He said according to Hinduism, it is a sin to show discrimination towards any religious group or persons. “It is anti-Hindu to allow citizenship on the basis of religion. We demand the government to withdraw the Act that has created anxiety and mistrust,” Chandran said.

Swami Vishwa Bhadrananda Shakthi Bodhi, Fr Jacob Puthenpurakkal, KPCC vice-presdient T Siddique, general secretary N Subramanian, IUML state vice-president C Moyinkutty, state secretary C P Cheriya Muhammed, Muslim Youth League state vice-president Najeeb Kanthapuram and others will attend the programme.

PUNE: A man (23) and his minor friend were detained on Saturday night, less than 24 hours after an autorickshaw driver (27) was bludgeoned to death near the leprosy hospital in Yeolewadi late on Friday night.

A resident of the area found the body on Saturday morning and alerted the city police control room. A team from the Kondhwa police rushed to the spot and identified the deceased as Bunty alias Akshay Suresh Gaikwad of Yeolewadi.

The victim’s body was found under a tree near the cattle shed adjacent to the hospital. Gaikwad died because of multiple head injuries. The motive behind the murder is still unclear.

Investigations revealed that Gaikwad and his two friends used to sit under the tree and consume liquor. Police suspect that his friends attacked him with a stick and stone over a dispute while consuming alcohol because his blood stain was found on them.

The victim’s identity was not known initially but the residents of the area helped the police identify him as there were no injury marks on his face. The victim’s brother, Amit Gaikwad (32), has lodged an FIR.

A police team led by assistant inspector Chetan More, under senior inspector Vinayak Gaikwad and inspector Mahadeo Kumbhar, have fanned teams for arresting the two friends.

319,['2/02/2020'],"Life, health covers may lose lure as sops turn optional","This story is from February 2, 2020

Sales of life and health insurance policies, which qualify for income tax breaks, are expected to take a big hit because of the new simplified income tax regime announced in the Union Budget. Tax savings, which was the biggest driver for life insurance , has lost relevance for many as the budget allows taxpayers to pay tax at a much lower rate if they forego exemptions.

“Most middle-class taxpayers will see this as -- lower tax slab, less paperwork. These will become the key motivations. Very few people take life insurance purely for protection - most view it as a savings or investment instrument. Now with that clear incentive gone, there will be a dip,” said a CGM from LIC.

Insurers feel that this a major setback because insurance penetration in India is low compared to other countries. Stocks on insurance companies fell following the budget announcement.

Every March 31st, it was common for staff members to work late into the night at LIC offices across India. Insurance agents would scurry around pressing LIC officers to take their last-minute proposals - as thousands of Indians tried to file for tax exemptions just before the deadline. But this might change this year, said sources.

IRDAI officials said they were completely taken aback by the Union Finance Minister’s budget announcement. “We were certainly not consulted on this. And it will have a negative impact on the sector,” said an IRDAI member. “But it is still early days. But, I have hope as the FM had a press conference following the budget announcement - and there she did mention the savings aspect.”

“Life insurance and health insurance will take a massive hit. Now that the tax benefit has become optional. While we will retain our older clientele, youngsters might decide to trade in financial security for more cash in hand,” said the LIC CGM.

Insurers say insurance was always a push product and now with the key incentive “tax” being removed not many might think of financial protection and fiscal prudence. “In India, the construct has always nudged future savings and risk management by encouraging conscious investment towards the same aided by tax relief. We have not seen announcements that will encourage risk management practices, ” said RM Vishakha, MD & CEO, IndiaFirst Life Insurance.

Institutions also say higher spending income should not have come at the cost of savings. “The option to individuals to opt for a lower tax slab structure with no deductions or to continue with the earlier higher slabs with deductions for home loan EMIs, investments in insurance etc seems slightly confusing. In a country like India with a young population with poor social security it is imperative to incentive young India to save for the future and own a house as well,” said Krishna Kumar Karwa , managing director, Emkay Global Financial Services .

BHOPAL: Before the start of the new academic session , divisional commissioner Kalpana Shrivastava has directed all CBSE and ICSE schools to upload the list of the textbooks prescribed by them, on their school websites. Schools have also been asked to abide by the by-laws of both the boards and refrain from selling books , notebooks, uniforms and bags on the school campuses.

“If the schools do not make the book lists available on their websites and are found guilty of flouting the CBSE and ICSE by-laws that clearly state that no school should engage in selling of books, bags, uniforms etc. on their campuses or direct parents to particular shops to buy the books, affiliation and NOCs of those schools may be cancelled by the state,” said Shrivastava.

Directorate of Public Instruction (DPI) had also issued a circular in December, directing schools to upload online the book list prescribed in the curriculum. Till January 31, 12 schools of the city had not done the same. Joint director Rajeev Tomar said the department will issue show-cause notices to the schools that failed to do so. “As per the orders, the DPI can also cancel the affiliation and NOC of the schools that do not submit the list of books to DPI even after issuing a showcause notice. We will take strict action against private schools that ask the parents to buy the books from a particular shop,” added Tomar.

The order issued by Shrivastava also directs schools to only use notebooks of the standard size and not ask students to buy different size notebooks bearing the school emblems to benefit a particular shop or individual. Notebooks, uniforms, ties, belts, blazers etc. should not have monograms and symbols for publicity of the school. Students should not be compelled to purchase a particular brand or size of notebook. Schools have been told to put up a sample of the uniform a month before the new academic session so that parents of the students can get the uniform as per their convenience.

PUNE: A man from Sangli was arrested and five others were booked on Saturday for their involvement in railway recruitment scam.

The Government Railway Police (GRP) took Vishwajit Shivajirao Mane (52) in custody at Pune station and launched a hunt with the Railway Protection Force (RPF) for the kingpin of the recruitment scam gang.

RPF inspector Ashwin Kumar said, “The prime suspect was arrested in many cheating cases earlier. He frequently changes his address. It is suspected that he is currently based in Delhi.”

Mane and the other suspects in the case promised unemployed youths jobs in different government departments, including Indian Railways. “They presented themselves as railway authorities, used computers to fill up forms, and issued OTPs and joining letters to victims after conducting medical tests,” he said.

Kumar said one Kailash Sanjay Jadhav (24) of Latur on Friday morning walked into the office of the Divisional Railway Manager (DRM), Pune, met a few officials and showed them a (bogus) joining letter issued against his name by the Indian Railways. “On close verification, the letter was found to be fake,” Kumar said.

Jadhav then filed a complaint at the GRP station, Pune. He had allegedly already paid Rs3.5 lakh to the suspects for the job of a junior clerk. “The authorities laid down a trap near the Pune railway station. When Mane came down to Pune on Saturday to collect the remaining amount of Rs50,000 from Jadhav, he was nabbed,” Kumar said.

Cormorants

AURANGABAD: Nashik ’s Nandur Madhyameshwar bird sanctuary becoming the first Ramsar site in Maharashtra has given hope to nature lovers and experts who are of the view that the coveted international tag would help in scientific conservation of the wetland.

Local area development committee Chapadgaon, which supervises the bird sanctuary along with the forest department officials, said that the Ramsar tag would help in addressing sensitive issues such as keeping watch on the wetland farming and fishing inside the sanctuary. Authorities also said that the international tag would help in demarcating the boundaries of the sanctuary and ensure proper protection of birds and other creatures there.

A recent spot visit to Nandur Madhyameshwar sanctuary by TOI revealed the cultivation of sugar cane among other crops as a part of the wetland farming inside some parts of the sanctuary, posing a risk to migratory and other birds due to use of pesticides, insecticides and other chemicals.

Amol Darade, who heads the local area development committee, Chapadgaon, said curbs on wetland farming inside the sanctuary was a sensitive issue and it would get resolved amicably due to Ramsar tag for the sanctuary.

“Different contrary claims are made by the locals and the government authorities when it comes to keeping watch on the wetland farming. While authorities are duty-bound to conserve the natural habitat, locals oppose to any objection to wetland farming as it would snatch their livelihood. These long-pending disputes could see an end as the sanctuary is under the international focus,” he said.

Besides wetland farming, Nandur Madhyameshwar sanctuary also witnesses fishing activity by a section of locals throughout out the year, except occasional days when the flow of visitors is high. The birds often getting caught in the nets used by fishermen, say locals.

Situated in the shallow backwaters of Nandur Madhyameshwar dam from Niphad taluka , Nandur Madhyameshwar sanctuary officially came into existence in 1986 and believed to be homes to different variety of birds including different Ibis, ducks, cormorants, egrets, herons, stork, kites, vultures, buzzards, harriers, osprey, quails, eagles and water Hens along with other creatures.

“The exact area on which spread of the sanctuary has taken place is yet to be ascertained against established official claims. It has to be defined officially after taking out of consideration the wetland farming inside the wetland. Such attempts could not materialize in past, but could yield success shortly,” members of local area development committee said.

Range forest officer BR Dhakare said that the Ramsar tag will ensure the scientific conservation of Nandur Madhyameshwar sanctuary by involving locals. “The international tag would help in addressing some of the pressing issues. We expect more avenues of funds and resources for the scientific conservation of the sanctuary. The employment opportunities are bound to increase further in the area as the tourist footfall including that of foreigners, is bound to increase in the future,” he said.

The number of Ramsar sites in India has now increased to 37 and the surface area covered by these sites is now 1,067,939 hectares.

During the drive, set to start from Sunday, the locals will be asked to give their feedback regarding civic issues. The feedback of Doonites would be taken into account while formulating plans for Smart City and other such projects. “Doon residents will be asked questions on healthcare facilities, road, and other smart city parameters. This is an online survey, so officials won’t be going door-to-door to take feedback,” Ashish Bhatgain, additional CEO of DSCL, told TOI.

He added that Dehradun, despite being selected for the Smart City project in the third round, has climbed up to the 19th spot from 99th. “I thank all Doonites as they have played a crucial role in this,” Bhatgain said.

328,['2/02/2020'],HC notice for neglect of Satna monuments,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Bhopal: The Madhya Pradesh high court has issued contempt notice to the director of the state archaeology department over failure to comply with its order pertaining to protection of monuments around the ‘Ram Van Gaman Path’ site in Satna district.

“The government has failed to notify five locations around Sarbhanga ashram in Satna as protected sites even as illegal miners continue to plunder rare artefacts dating back to 10th and 11th Century BC, which are buried near an ashram in Chitrakoot, which bears Lord Ram’s footprints during his 14-year exile,” said advocate Nithyanand Mishra, who had been taking up this issue for long.

As per the provisions of the Section 3 of Madhya Pradesh Ancient Monuments, Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1963, notification should be issued within two months of issuance of the first notice.

The government had in 2016 decided to notify five locations around Sarbhanga ashram as a protected site by invoking powers of the 1963 Act, and the state’s culture department had said the area would be declared ‘state protected monument’ after two months from date of issue of the notice on May 26. Once notification is issued under section 3(1) of the said Act, a final notification has to be issued within next two months.

“I had filed an RTI in the archaeology department seeking information on expenditures incurred on protecting the said monuments and the reply was ‘nil’. It is for this reason that I am perusing this matter,” Mishra told TOI.

“Both Congress and BJP were talking about ‘Ram Van Gaman Path’ during elections and now I can’t see anyone around,” Mishra added.

A study by the state’s archaeology department had pressed panic buttons regarding the loot of relics in Satna district. The area is rich in bauxite, laterite and ochre. Sources said many antiques on Sanwar hill, where Sarbhanga ashram is located, have been stolen and smuggled out during mining operations in the last five years. Several idols have also been damaged due to the use of heavy mining machinery and the damaged ones were found abandoned.

The epic legacy around another hillock near Sarbhanga ashram known as ‘Siddha Pahar’, where Lord Ram vowed to eliminate demons and spent nearly 12 years of exile, has almost vanished following illegal mining. The area is spread across 100 acres of land. Sanwar and Siddha Pahar are located within a 2-kilometre radius.

On August 17, 2015, the high court had ordered the state’s archaeology department to study in detail ‘Ram Van Gaman Path’ in the three months and conserve sites of archaeological importance. According to the report, some ancient idols were damaged during mining. This study was ordered by a division bench of the high court, while hearing a petition alleging that no inquiry or study has been conducted and these sites are not declared as protected.

KOLKATA: The news of the introduction of foreign direct investment in higher education has kindled hope for a turnaround in the sector. A greater financial flow can boost research and development, help hire good teachers and introduce courses matching market requirements.

The government will, however, have to put in place a regulatory mechanism and mention the clearances required for the investments. “The FDI will be a shot in the arm for higher education institutes that can upgrade themselves to world-class standards. It will also aid research and development and encourage technological innovations,” said Pradeep Chopra, chairman of iLead University.

Many meritorious students leave the country for higher studies, dealing a double blow to domestic institutions as well as the economy. FDI is likely to solve the problem to a large extent. “We need a massive investment to boost infrastructure and remove financial constraints in the sector. With adequate flow of funds, universities can set up facilities to nurture talents,” said Dhrubajyoti Chattopadhyay, Amity University VC.

Other announcements by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman also invited praises. “The increase in the outlay for higher education this year sends a signal that the sector is on the priority list. It will renew focus on student entrepreneurship and internship,” said Meghdut RoyChowdhury, director, global operations, Techno India Group. Sardar Taranjit Singh, JIS Group MD said, “For innovations and better teachers, we need higher financial inflow. We can set up advanced labs, aimed at exchange programmes.”

RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat

Bhopal: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said that India is not merely geography but a habit. Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the three-day ‘Yuva Sankalp Shivir’ held in Guna, Bhagwat said, “The footprints of our culture are found all over the world and it is India’s responsibility to guide the world”.

Senior RSS office-bearers Ashok Sohni and Satish Pimpalkar were also present during the event. More than 1,000 youths from 16 districts across Madhya Pradesh are taking part in the event.

Bhagwat said the country does not require a politician, but a dedicated leader who can bring about change in the society. “No nation can progress without development of its society”, he said.

“Today, everyone wants to be on the forefront as a leader, which is not right. There are people who work silently for the progress of the country as a foundation stone and spend their whole life for the purpose. We don’t even know their name, but today out country is progressing because of them and their selfless efforts. We all should try to be like them for a better cause,” Bhagwat said.

“Many of us have developed a very wrong habit of getting everything without self-participation,” the RSS supremo added. Bhagwat visited Guna after a gap of 16 years, said sources.

“The concept of ‘Yuva Sankalp Shivir’ enables the RSS to directly get in touch with the young masses. The Sangh is focusing on students who have passed Class 12 and are pursuing degree courses. The idea is to give young minds the right direction and motto in life,” said a RSS worker.

Urban local bodies across India wiil provide internships to fresh engineers for up to one year

PUNE: Several ongoing infrastructure projects, technology upgradation and smart city projects of civic bodies will provide internship opportunities to engineering students .

The Union Budget 2020 includes a proposal to start a programme whereby urban local bodies across the country would provide internship opportunities to fresh engineers for up to one year.

Representatives of engineering colleges said that students would be able to contribute to the city’s infrastructure development through the initiative.

The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) too had suggested a move in the same direction nearly two years ago.

Chairman of ASM Educational Group Sandeep Pachpande said, “Throughout last year, we came across a number of reports suggesting the skill inadequacy of our graduate students when it comes to performing at the workplace and the implications were quite alarming. This initiative will not only help graduates get involved in the development of the society and enrich their knowledge through hands-on experience, but it will also lead to the infusion of a technologically proficient generation into the system that will give birth to fresh ideas.”

Pachpande further said that he hoped the same privilege would also be extended to other fields of study in the near future.

Additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal shared, “The engineering students will definitely be an asset for the local bodies. There are so many ongoing development projects in every local body. The students will be able to understand and take in information related to these projects. Their skills and knowledge could also be utilized by the municipal corporations, so it will be a give-and-take process.”

Local bodies take on numerous public programmes yet they often lack the proper manpower. The one-year internship could help students plan their future and their careers in a better fashion, said Agarwal.

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh ’s share in Union Budget in the form of central taxes has been cut by Rs 14,000 crore. It would directly hit the state budget to be presented in a month.

The state would get Rs 49,000 crore against Rs 63,000 crore. Officials said it is unprecedented since the amount is even lesser than what the state got last year, which was Rs 55,000 crore.

State finance minister Tarun Bhanot said Narendra Modi government did step motherly treatment with MP. It would impact the people of the state including farmers, he added.

Officials of state finance department pointed that MP’s share was cut by Rs 14,233 crore in the Budget. MP got Rs 49,517 crore as central taxes in Union Budget as against the estimated amount of Rs 63,750 crore announced for MP in the interim budget in February last year. It was cut down to Rs 61,073 crore in the budget tabled in July and further slashed down sharply.

The Rs 14,233 crore cut in the Budget is unprecedented and has happened for the first time. On an average one to two thousand crores were cut or added going by the past records. In the previous budget MP got around Rs 55,000 crore from the centre that has been brought down by Rs 6,000 crore this time, officials said, adding that the amount is final and no room for any add on.

Process to finalize the state budget is underway and finance department collected the demand of money from the departments. The allocation against the demand was not done as the finance department was waiting to get picture of the allocation the state gets from the centre clear. Based on the state’s share cut down by the centre, the finance department would also have to slash the demand of departments.

It would mean closing of a number of running government schemes, besides, taking other steps to meet the state’s demand.

Normally, there is an increase of 15 to 20% in state budget every year, but this year there would be no increase and the departments willing to start new schemes would have to first close the existing ones.

The Kamal Nath-led Congress government had in July presented its first budget for the financial year 2019-20. It was worth Rs 2,33,605 crore, an increase in appropriation by 20%. The previous year budget for 2018-19, presented by the then BJP government was of Rs 2,04,642.44 crore.

Pune: Cantonment boards across the country now have an uphill task on the financial front following an allocation of around Rs382 crore in the 2020-21 Union Budget for the Defence Estates Organisation, a sharp drop from Rs497.15 crore in the previous fiscal.

The boards in Maharashtra — Pune, Khadki, Dehu Road, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Deolali and Kamptee — will be even more affected, because the cantonments are not recognized as urban local bodies under the state’s tax laws, GST or otherwise.

A senior Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) official on Saturday said it has barely Rs6 crore left to spend and its administration is worried about paying salaries from February. The other 18 boards under Southern Command, which included Secunderabad, have also been struggling with their finances. These areas have lagged behind their adjacent municipal areas in recent years in terms of development.

During a meeting of the PCB in January, Pune MP Girish Bapat had referred to the cantonment boards as “a relic from the British era” and favoured their abolition. The Indian Army had previously ordered a feasibility study for transferring the civilian areas in the cantonments to adjacent municipal bodies. The Army continues to operate and maintain the military areas.

A senior official of the PCB, one of the largest cantonments in the country, conceded that the finances were “precarious enough” for them to stop almost all development of infrastructure, “with captive revenue sources becoming limited”.

Another PCB official said the budgetary share would translate into even lesser on ground, as the Defence Estates Organisation allocation “is meant for cantonment boards, as well as defence land both inside and outside the boards’ jurisdictions, and requisition and hiring of immovable properties for defence purposes”.

“The only project going on is a multi-level parking space. But we are not able to make regular payments to the contractor. We only have money to pay the salaries for February. For all practical purposes, we are a municipal body. It is defined so in the Cantonments Act and the Central GST Act, but not in the state law. As a result, we are not getting GST funds,” the official told TOI.

When he headed the Southern Command, Army vice chief Lt Gen S K Saini had written to CM Uddhav Thackeray in January, seeking GST funds for the cantonments in the state. Despite multiple appeals over the years, the reclassification has not happened.

“I plan to file a PIL in court so that the state government gives funds to us,” PCB member Atul Gaikwad said.

In a gazette notification issued on January 24, 2018, the state had allowed private medical colleges to make use of state-run district hospitals for teaching purposes. The state, through this decision, had aimed to improve patient-care services at district hospitals by tackling the problem of insufficient doctors.“The government wanted to go the Gujarat way, where all district or civil hospitals are run on a PPP basis,” a senior official of the state public health department said.However, the plan — mainly aimed at districts that had state-run hospitals but no colleges — found little traction.“We didn’t get any response.

But nothing happened. The project has remained on paper,” a senior state health official said.A senior professor of a medical college said qualified manpower was the biggest hurdle that rendered the plan ineffective. “A medical officer of a district hospital can be inducted as a lecturer or an associate professor, based on experience.

Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune

PUNE: The city-based Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) and the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, will be involved in the National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications (QTA).

The mission received an outlay of Rs 8,000 crore for five years in the Union budget presented on Saturday.

Among the four verticals of this mission, IISER and C-DAC would be contributing to quantum sensor and metrology and quantum computing & simulations.

Some everyday applications of quantum technology will be autonomous vehicle navigation, weather prediction, transportation planning, pharmaceutical development, secure financial communications, and resource exploration.

On a day-to-day basis, the technology would help improve the accuracy in navigation by using atomic clock, have secure banking transactions by encrypting the data, and in healthcare sector the technology would help to map tiny magnetic fields in the brain.

Director general of C-DAC Hemant Darbari said they had sent inputs and a detailed plan along with other members on the aspects of quantum technology, algorithm, communication and cryptology. “We will be actively participating in the quantum simulation and computational part of the mission,” he added.

Darbari said the mission aims at harnessing the potential of QTA and keeps the country in league with the leaders in the sector.

On October 1, last year, a national consultative meeting was held at IISER, Pune, on Quantum Sensors & Metrology, one of the four verticals of QTA.

338,['2/02/2020'],"Rs 5 lakh bank insurance not retrospective, won’t help PMC","This story is from February 2, 2020

Mumbai: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget speech, has proposed to hike bank deposit insurance cover in scheduled commercial banks to Rs 5 lakh per depositor from the current Rs 1 lakh. Henceforth, if such a bank goes bust, its account holders are entitled to receive the revised amount insured.

Even after the proposal is passed, though, this clause will not apply to past cases such as PMC Bank , considering that it will not be invoked with retrospective effect.

Moreover, the procedure is long and cumbersome, lasting years, with little or no precedent of success, say depositors who have scarcely received basic insurance amount of Rs 1 lakh due to long-drawn legal loopholes and wrangles.

PMC Bank depositor Clifford D’Souza of Andheri East said, “Hardly any people have small deposits of up to Rs 5 lakh in banks. Most have investments of Rs 10-20 lakh, even crores. So, Rs 5 lakh insurance is no relief. But most of all, we are not seeking insurance, we are asking to be able to retrieve our own hard-earned money.”

D’Souza said the route to insurance was fraught with procedural delays and red tape. “Elderly depositors will not even live to see the day. The sum is released after the bank goes under liquidation and is declared insolvent, a process that can take more than a decade. By then, inflation will have reduced the value of Rs 5 lakh by half. It is not as if depositors will simply get a cheque after the bank goes bust,” he said. “We need our money, and we need it now.”

Kochi: The state could benefit from the proposal in the Union budget to set up a National Mission on Quantum Technologies with an outlay of Rs 8,000 crore, according to experts.

Quantum technology is an emerging field in the intersection of physics and engineering with applications in areas like quantum computing, communications and cyber security.

“There are a lot of possibilities but we need to know what the framework of the mission is. If it can be aligned with the existing thrust on creating a deep-tech startup environment, we can accelerate innovations in this sector,” said Maker Village CEO Prasad Balakrishnan Nair. It can also be used to bridge the industry-academia gap by creating institutions like the Blockchain Academy to ensure an innovation pipeline, he said.

The move to set up data centre parks in the private sector throughout the country would also be beneficial to the state’s IT sector as it is a sector that can attract huge investments.

“Through such parks, they may be proposing to set up multiple data centres at a single place. Setting up of data centres is mandatory as per new data policy,” said Infopark, Kochi CEO Sasi P M.

Currently, a greenfield datacentre, Pi-Kochi, is being set up at Infopark Phase 2 with a planned investment of Rs 400 crore.

Bhopal: Chief minister Kamal Nath on Saturday described the Union Budget as “disappointing for the country” and “jugglery of numbers”. He said the budget has not even addressed the increasing unemployment scenario and has presented several old schemes as new.

In a series of tweets on Saturday afternoon, chief minister @OfficeOfKNath said, “Today, the annual budget speech presented by the finance minister was definitely a long one, but a total jugglery of numbers, disappointing for the country and only displaying unrealistic dreams. There is nothing for the village— poor—farmers—youth—employment – protection of women.”

A second tweet by the chief minister argued, “There is no mention of how to rid unemployment and generate employment for the youth. Again, as usual, dreams have been shown of doubling the income of farmers. Several old schemes have been presented as new.”

CM Nath also tweeted, “This budget lacks a roadmap for the country’s development, progress and a strategy to halt the falling economy and inflation. A large part of the country lives in the rural areas which has been totally ignored in the budget.”

In his fourth tweet, chief minister Nath alleged, “Had all the false dreams shown by the Modi government in the previous budgets, which Modi Bhakts used to openly praise, been fulfilled then the country’s economy would not have been in this bad condition.”

Final tweet from CM on the budget said it betrays the state’s interest. “There has been a cut of Rs 11,556 crores in the state’s share of Central taxes in the revised estimates. If this amount is added to the Rs 2,677 crores slashed last year, it adds to a whopping Rs 14,233 crore. This is a betrayal of the interests of Madhya Pradesh.”

Pune: Ind-SAT for Asian and African students for awarding scholarships to study in India will bring quality students, heads of educational institutions in the city said.

The challenge will be its large scale implementation, especially in countries where internet connectivity is poor. Currently, there is no standard examination for foreign students coming to India.

Vidya Yeravdekar, principal director of Symbiosis Society said they had 75 scholarship students from the Study in India programme last year and 45 this year.

“Bandwidth will be a problem in many African countries. But the test will help students take India seriously. It will create a level playing field. At present, we rely on marks obtained by students in their country,” Yeravdekar said. There are about 3,000 students studying in the university.

Vijay Khare, director of Savitribai Phule Pune University’s International Centre that also has about 3,000 students, said they get 300 students from the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) on scholarship.

“ Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan do not have English in schools curricula which makes it difficult for these students to learn when they come to India. With a test like this, students will know what standards to expect,” Khare added.

At a conference last week in Pune, Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, president of ICCR, spoke about how instead of teaching English after foreign students come to India, Indian embassies and ICCR centres can double up as English coaching centres to help students reach required standards to apply for a study programme in India.

342,['2/02/2020'],MP lags in health budget expenditure,"This story is from February 2, 2020

HEALING TOUCH

Bhopal: Look at the actual expenditure of allocated health budget over allocation, said health activists. Actual health budget spending on medical treatment and other services that have a direct impact on people needs to be increased, said activists while reacting on the Union Budget. Overall, health budgetary allocation has increased by 15% to Rs 62,659 crore.

“Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have already opposed Niti Ayog’s proposal to hand over district hospitals through PPP model to build medical colleges. The government has been unable to spend more than 60% of last year budget under PMJAY,” said Amulya Nidhi, co-convenor of NGO Swasthya Adhikar Manch. Linking handover of district hospital on PPP model with central government funding is now likely. Ensuring the allocated budget is spent on improving healthcare in MP is most important, he added.

“Health and wellness centre are already far behind their target . Of the planned 75,000 centres, only one-third have begun in last three years. Under Ayushman Bharat 2019-20, out of allocated Rs 6,556 crore, only 33% budget (Rs 2186) was utilised.

Health sector funding is expected to hit negatively with budget for national health mission (NHM) remaining static. Grants-in-aid to state governments is also static. It provides for transfer to state to support decentralized planning and flexible programming by the states including development of state and district-level Project Implementation Plans (PIPs) with a focus on outcomes particularly relating to vulnerable sections, and community based monitoring and evaluation. The activities under the NHM provides for health needs of rural population including control of vector-borne diseases, TB and leprosy.

A reduction in grant in aid to grants-in-aid to state governments in the Union Budget is expected to hit Swastha Nagrik Abhiyan (SNA), Population Research Centres, Health Surveys and Research Studies along with procurement of Contraceptives for Social Marketing and Free Distribution, Training of Doctors in NSV/Recanalisation technique among others.

Establishment of new medical colleges and increase of seats in existing government medical colleges is Rs 4,686 crore. However, budget for Upgradation/Strengthening of Nursing Services (ANM/GNM), Strengthening/Upgradation of Pharmacy School/College District Hospital - Upgradation of State Government Medical Colleges (PG Seats), Strengthening Government Medical Colleges (UG Seats) and Central Government Health Institutions Establishing New Medical Colleges (upgrading District Hospitals) and Setting up of State Institutions of Para-medical Sciences in States and Setting up of College of Para-medical Education has been reduced.

“If the union budget has been increased, the state budget will also be increased proportionately. Like we have begun the safe city programme in six cities of MP, if we get more funds, the programme can be extended to other cities too and make the state safer for women”, said principal secretary of the department Anupam Rajan.

The safe city programme by the WCD MP aims to make cities of the state safer for women by installing lights in dark and isolated areas, starting cabs and autos driven by women along with opening crisis centres for women.

The budget for the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana a maternity benefit programme, has been increased from Rs 2,300 crore to Rs 2,500 crore in 2020-21.

Director of city Childine Archana Sahaya added, “Safety of women is a burning issue in the country and a lot of new schemes to prevent crimes against women and children need to be made. Schemes for pregnant women and new mothers are also very important for the state for the welfare of the mother and child and ensuring proper nutrition for them.”

Another social worker Rakesh Malviya of NGO Vikas Samvad that focuses on health, nutrition and education for women and children said, “Just increasing the budget is not enough, proper implementation is necessary. It’s a good thing that the central government has increased the budget for safety of women but is also necessary to use it properly instead of just making schemes on paper.”

At least nine ships that have passed through affected countries are anchored off the Odisha coast and their crew members have been denied permission to disembark even as the virus has claimed more than 250 lives and infected thousands in China.

“At present we have no plans to examine crew members on the ships,” said Dr Prahallad Panda, medical officer of Paradip Port Hospital, on Saturday. “But we have made arrangements for screening crew members in Paradip port and directed the captains to inform us if any crew member is suffering from fever, cough and cold and related illness.

Sources said that a commercial vessel normally has between 25 to 30 crew members. Rinkesh Roy, chairman of Paradip Port Trust (PPT), admitted that they have decided not to provide shore leave to crew members of ships that have recently sailed through China and other affected countries.

“This is a particularly bad time because of the coronavirus. So we have refused permission to the crew members to disembark,” Roy said.

Bhopal: Farmers’ organisations have ridiculed the Centre's claim of doubling their income by 2022. The state agriculture minister also termed the budget as “disappointing”.

The state government has said that the Centre’s claim of doubling the farmers’ income was “hollow” as there was no government plan to do so.

National president of Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, Shivkumar Sharma alias Kakka ji, said that the present average monthly income of farmers in India was Rs 1,566 per month. By doubling this by 2022, they want to increase it to Rs 3,132. “Even labourers in India get more money. The government representatives who want to achieve this should hang their head with shame,” said Sharma.

Instead of misleading the farmers, the government should ensure better price for their produce and timely compensation for crop damage, especially after climate change conditions.

State agriculture minister Sachin Yadav said the farmers of Madhya Pradesh were looking at budget 2020 with great hopes, but they were disappointed. Almost 70% of the population of Madhya Pradesh is linked with agriculture, but the provisions made in the budget for this community were too small.

Though the finance minister talked about doubling the farmers’ income by 2022, no concrete plan in this regard was presented in the budget. Similarly, there was no word for providing one-and-a-half times cost of the produce as compared to the cost of farming.

“Modi government has proved once again that it was not concerned over the “plight of the poor, farmer and rural folk”.

Bhartiya Kisan Sangh general secretary Anil Yadav said that the government should change its perception towards farmers’ need. “They put in hard work but get meagre returns. The government should ensure proper rates for their produce and timely payment of their dues.”

However, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar praised Narendra Modi for “growth-oriented budget provisions for farmers.”

Vijayawada: The government ’s plan to pool land from residents to an extent of 6,116 acres in 10 mandals near Visakhapatnam has drawn criticism from civic activists . While lauding the government’s plan to provide housing or house sites to poor, they said the move to evict the poor to give land to other poor people lacks merit and called for immediate scrapping of GO No 72.

“In the name of facilitating housing and house sites to the poor, land that is in the possession of and belongs to the poor is being sought to be acquired. This is unacceptable and we strongly urge the government to desist from going ahead with the public hearings to take over these lands,” said M Sarat, president of Human Rights Forum’s Visakhapatnam unit.

VS Krishna, coordination committee member of HRF in AP and Telangana, said while the process appears to be pro-poor, in reality it only undermines the poor people’s means of survival. “Among the lands sought to be acquired under the land pooling scheme are 2,552 acres of assigned land and 2,343 acres of occupied land. Those holding the land are the poor and Dalits who the government now wants to dispossess,” he said.

Civic rights activist EAS Sarma was more trenchant in his criticism. “Despite being aware of the mess the erstwhile TDP government’s land-pooling act created in Amaravati, this government still issued GO 72, which is aimed at evicting the poor from lands where they have lived on for generations. Land occupied by the poor (predominantly small, marginal farmers) is tilled by them for subsistence. How are they to survive if this land is taken over and a small extent given them in return?” Sarma asked.

“If the government really seeks to acquire land for housing and handing over house sites to the poor, it would do well to just leave the land on which the poor rely on and instead take over extents that are in plain encroachment by the rich and powerful,” he added.

356,['2/02/2020'],"7 months go by, no action taken yet against encroachments on NH-16","This story is from February 2, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Despite several requests from the transport department and social activists to remove illegal encroachments from the clogged NH-16 stretch passing through the city, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) is yet to initiate an eviction drive.

“It’s ridiculous. Not only us (social activists), even the transport department sent requests to GVMC two months back. But the civic authorities have just turned a deaf ear,” said social activist Tenneti Narasimham, who has fighting for this cause for several years now. In October last year, the deputy transport commissioner of Visakhapatnam, G C Raja Ratnam, had also sent a letter to the GVMC commissioner, requesting him to take necessary action to remove encroachments along the highway.

GVMC officials, on their part, claim that they are scrutinizing the claims and trying to find out whether the illegal structures are actually encroaching the highway. “It’s not easy to evict them overnight. We have to follow certain procedures. Now that we have an interim commissioner, the procedure is likely to get delayed,” a civic body official said.

If the government’s proposal to make Visakhapatnam the executive capital takes shape, the number of vehicles would increase by leaps and bounds and the NH-16 stretch could become a nightmare for motorists. “The situation is already bad. Traffic hardly moves on the stretch during peak hours. Imagine what would happen if vehicle movement in the city doubles within a few months,” added Narasimham.

It may be recalled that the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), in its report in June last year, identified 227 illegal encroachments on the 6km stretch from zoo park to Maddilapalem crossing. The report further stated that around 208 of these encroachments — which include bars, restaurants, bakeries, garment showrooms etc — were permanent in nature. “GVMC is the authority to take legal steps against these encroachments,” a NHAI official said.

The government set a stiff target of raising Rs 2.1 lakh crore from disinvestment in state-run companies in the next fiscal while unveiling its plan to list the country’s top insurer, Life Insurance Corporation.

The FM said government would also consider corporatising at least one major port and subsequently listing it on the stock exchanges as part of the plan to realise value in PSU firms.

Government had targeted raising Rs 1.05 lakh crore from stake sale in state-run companies in 2019-20 but in the revised estimates, the target was lowered to Rs 65,000 crore as some big ticket sales failed to take off.

The Rs 2.1 lakh crore target for next year includes Rs 90,000 crore from sale of stake in state-run banks and financial institutions. The rest is expected to come from sale in state-run firms.

“Listing on stock exchanges disciplines a company and provides access to financial markets and unlocks its value. It also gives opportunity for retail investors to participate in the wealth so created. The government now proposes to sell a part of its holding in LIC by way of Initial Public Offer,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her speech. Later, she told TOI she expected all strategic stake sale cases like BPCL, Air India and others to go through soon as most of the spadework had been done.

The FM also unveiled plans to sell balance holding of the government in IDBI Bank to private, retail and institutional investors through the stock exchange.

Around 2.5 crore aspirants, who take separate, multiple examinations conducted by different recruiting agencies for selection to around 1.25 lakh government jobs every year, will soon need to appear for a single online common eligibility test ( CET ), with the test scores remaining valid for three years for recruitment to any non-gazetted post.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said a National Recruitment Agency (NRA) was proposed to conduct a computer-based CET for recruitment to non-gazetted posts. A test centre would be set up in every district, particularly in ‘ aspirational districts ’. Separate CETs shall be conducted for graduate, Class XII-pass and matriculate-level candidates for non-technical posts, for which recruitment is currently done through Staff Selection Commission (SSC), Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) and Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS).This is expected to cut costs and time — for the government, recruiting agencies and candidates — in recruitment process for non-gazetted posts in government and public sector banks. And, of course, make it more convenient for aspirants.As of now, aspirants need to appear for multiple examinations conducted by various agencies at different points of time, for similar posts demanding similar eligibility criteria. “This places enormous burden on time, effort and cost of young people,” the minister pointed out.“At present, youths need to appear for separate examinations for recruitment to government jobs. We are revising this arrangement by starting an online common examination for such appointments,” Modi said.Minister of state, personnel, Jitendra Singh said CET would help candidates who are from weaker financial backgrounds as a common test will save money. They will no longer have to pay fees separately for multiple recruitment exams, and won’t have to travel to several test centres. “It will also provide a level-playing field for aspirants,” he told TOI.The CET score — valid for three years from date of declaration of the result — will be made available to the candidate and individual recruitment agencies. Each candidate will have two additional chances to improve their score, and the best of all scores will be considered.The CET merit list may be made available to states by NRA on cost-sharing basis, to undertake recruitment to state government jobs. “The CET score can also be utilised by the private sector to consider eligible candidates, other than those selected by government recruitment agencies, through an arrangement with NRA,” said a government functionary.The Budget estimates that more than 2.62 lakh jobs are likely to be created between March 2019 and March 2021 in various government organisations. The strength of government establishments was 32,62,908 as on March 1, 2019.The CET proposal was placed in the public domain in December, inviting comments from central government departments, state governments and public. “We will incorporate the suggestions and move a cabinet note soon.

Looking for ‘impact’, he got weapon from friend

NEW DELHI: Just two days after a juvenile was shot at and injured a student at a Jamia University protest, three shots rang out at Shaheen Bagh on Saturday evening. A 25-year-old man opened fire with a countrymade weapon, leading to chaos in the area. Identified as Kapil Gurjar, the man had reached the protest site and managed to cross the first of three barricades put up behind the shamiana of the protesters.Gurjar approached a tea stall around 4.30pm and spoke to the owner about the protest. He then suddenly whipped out a pistol and started firing in the air. ""He asked me how long would the protest continue, but before I could reply, he walked away. I didn't realise he was firing until I saw policemen running after him. He was running zigzag to avoid getting caught,"" said the tea-stall owner.Hearing the first gunshot, volunteers at the protest site rushed out to nab Gurjar and stop him from going any further. ""He was running around with the weapon and we feared that he might again fire at the stage where the women were sitting. We alerted the policemen and ran after him,"" said Kafil Akhtar.Even as he was being chased, Gurjar fired two more rounds in the air to intimidate them and deter them from coming his way. He, however, ran out of luck. A police team standing behind the first barricade managed to surround Gurjar even as one of the volunteers snatched the pistol from his hand.According to eyewitnesses, he was shouting religious slogans. Later, while being bundled into a car, he came face to face with some reporters. He promptly shouted, "" Hamare desh me kisi ki nai chalegi, sirf Hinduon ki chalegi (In our country, no one but Hindus will have a say),"" before being taken away by the cops.Gurjar claimed that he was angry with the protesters since the closure of the Kalindi Kunj road was leading to snarls on Ring Road. He said his father owned a dairy in the area and he and his brother helped distribute milk. Lately, he has been travelling back and forth from Dallupura to Lajpat Nagar to supply milk for a relative's wedding. During this, he had to spend hours stuck in the traffic jam. He has also been reading about the hardships people are facing due to the protests and was upset about it.Gurjar told the cops that he had decided to do something that would create an impact. He had reached Shaheen Bagh after going to Sarai Kale Khan in a bus and then travelled in an auto-rickshaw.Luckily, no one was injured in the firing since Gurjar fired in the air. Also, the protest site was beyond the range of the weapon and the road was nearly empty.Gurjar was taken to the Sarita Vihar police station and his family members were informed. During interrogation, he allegedly claimed that he had got the pistol from a friend, whose identity is being verified. Police say he has been giving contradictory statements.“We have registered a case under Section 336 of IPC (endangering safety of others) and Arms Act against the man and are trying to find out how he managed to procure the weapon,” said Mandeep Singh Randhawa, Delhi Police PRO. He added that following Thursday’s shooting incident, security was being beefed up at all protest sites and multiple barricades were being installed to prevent entry of outsiders.Cops added that from now on they would start frisking people entering the protest site. Till Saturday, people were either slipping in from the sides or coming through the lanes in the area. With Shaheen Bagh becoming a poll issue, the police are not willing to take any chances.Police will question Gurjar’s family members to find out whether he had been planning the incident for some time. His mobile phone has been sent for forensic analysis. Cops are also scanning his Facebook profile to find out whether he was being influenced by someone. He will be produced in court on Sunday where cops will seek his custody for cracking the case.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73858589,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-194016,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/now-shaheen-bagh-man-fires-in-air-caught-by-cops/articleshow/73858581.cms
361,['2/02/2020'],People enthused about Union Budget but doubts over implementation persist,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Dharwad: ‘Promising on paper, doubtful about its implementation,’ was the prevalent notion among homemakers, farmers , experts and the general public about the 2020-21 Union Budget presented by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Lok Sabha on Saturday.

Most people who shared their views on the budget with STOI opined that, while the policies outlined held the promise of reviving the economy, they were as sceptical about the implementation of the ideas.

Representatives of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India’s Employees’ Union were vehement in expressing their opposition to the proposal in the budget to privatise Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) and LIC. On the other hand, stakeholders in the education sector were appreciative of the thrust to improve the sector, although they were disappointed with the cancellation of exemptions to institutions.

Union minister for parliamentary affairs and Dharwad MP Pralhad Joshi opined that the budget would accelerate the growth of the Indian economy. “The plans outlined in the budget are in keeping with the central government’s vision of ‘Sab Ka Saath, Sab Ka Vikas Aur Sab Ka Lakshya (Development for all, with an eye on the goals of all),” said Joshi, expressing his gratitude to Nirmala for allocating Rs 18,600 crore for the suburban rail project in Bengaluru, and reaffirming the Centre’s commitment to complete work on the Bengaluru-Chennai Expressway by 2023.

Harish Ramaswamy, a political analyst, said that, confronted with a flagging economy, the Union finance minister had acquitted herself well in rolling out policies that would ensure its revival. “This is an honest attempt at providing a cure for an ailing economy. Measures have been proposed to resuscitate the automobile sector, and reforms mooted for the banking sector are welcome. Hopes from this budget were very high, and the finance minister has ensured a good balance,” said Ramaswamy.

On the other hand, farmers’ leader Gangadhar Patilkulkarni said that peasants had been left disappointed with the budget. “There is nothing encouraging for farmers in this budget. There is no mention of a loan waiver instead of which one sees moves that may drown us in more loans,” he said.

Karnataka Vikas Grameena Bank chairman P Gopikrishna felt that there was a triangular focus to the budget’s vision: Aspirational India, economic development and a caring society. “It will have a positive impact in the industrial sector, infrastructure and holds the promise of generating employment,” said Gopikrishna.

Prof Rudragouda Biradar, who teaches in the department of economics at Karnatak University, dubbed the budget ‘growth-oriented’ and ‘people-friendly’.

Dyammanna (second from left) submits a petition asking help from the local administration to find him a bride

HUBBALLI: Having given up on society, family and friends to come to his rescue, a 63-year-old priest has approached the gram panchayat of Naregal in Hangal taluk of Haveri to find him a bride.

While villagers are sympathetic to Dyammanna Kammar’s “need for someone to understand my feelings and support me in life”, they also have a deadline: the priest has refused to perform the rituals for the upcoming village fair unless his demand is met.

Kammar says it is not for lack of trying that he remains a bachelor at this ripe age. “I studied up to SSLC and could not continue my education due to poverty. After my parents died, we three brothers and four sisters got separated. Except me, all are well-settled. I tried to find myself a suitable match but I was rejected for being poor,” he rues.

For decades now, Kammar has been performing prayers and rituals at the local Dyammava temple and lives on his own in a rented house. “Somehow, I have managed alone all these years, cooking for myself and doing odd chores for a livelihood. But now that I have turned 63, I can’t live alone. I need a partner to live the rest of my life happily and peacefully,” he says.

Somanna Barki, secretary of Naregal gram panchayat, says Kammar has been pressing his unique demand for sometime now. “He was frequenting our office, requesting us to help him marry. Finally, he has submitted a petition seeking the government’s help,” says Barki.

Kammar submitted his petition to the gram panchayat president and panchayat development officer (PDO) on Friday. “Age is no issue. If I get support from the government or others, I will start my own shop or business and get married. There are instances of people marrying after they turned 70, I am just 63”, he says.

Meanwhile, adds Barki, the village is gearing up to celebrate the Dyammavan jatre (fair) from February 14 to 22 and Kammar has refused to perform the religious rituals, “insisting that he must get married and government should help him”. Kammar earns Rs 200 to Rs 300 a day and has no assets or property to fall back on.

Barki says the priest’s ultimatum is a village concern now: “We will take up this matter for discussion in the next general body meeting of the gram panchayat. We will also meet villagers to figure out how we can help Dyammanna.”

PMC Bank account holders protest at Bandra branch in Mumbai (ANI Photo)

MUMBAI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman , in her Budget speech, has proposed to hike bank deposit insurance cover in scheduled commercial banks to Rs 5 lakh per depositor from the current Rs 1 lakh. Henceforth, if such a bank goes bust, its account holders are entitled to receive the revised amount insured.

Even after the proposal is passed, though, this clause will not apply to past cases such as PMC Bank , considering that it will not be invoked with retrospective effect.

Moreover, the procedure is long and cumbersome, lasting years, with little or no precedent of success, say depositors who have scarcely received basic insurance amount of Rs 1 lakh due to long-drawn legal loopholes and wrangles.

PMC Bank depositor Clifford D'Souza of Andheri East said, ""Hardly any people have small deposits of up to Rs 5 lakh in banks. Most have investments of Rs 10-20 lakh, even crores. So, Rs 5 lakh insurance is no relief. But most of all, we are not seeking insurance, we are asking to be able to retrieve our own hard-earned money.""

D'Souza said the route to insurance was fraught with procedural delays and red tape. ""Elderly depositors will not even live to see the day. The sum is released after the bank goes under liquidation and is declared insolvent, a process that can take more than a decade. By then, inflation will have reduced the value of Rs 5 lakh by half. It is not as if depositors will simply get a cheque after the bank goes bust,"" he said. ""We need our money, and we need it now.""

MUMBAI: Two businessmen and their employees had a lucky escape when a masked man opened fired at two shops in Malad (east) on Saturday. The firings took place within 10 minutes of each other. The police said local goon Uday Phatak, main accused in the Kurar quadruple murder case, was behind it.

In the first case, a bullet shattered glass shelves of the medical store. In the other, a bullet whizzed past the owner of an imitation jewellery shop and hit the roof.

The masked man first walked into Anand Medical & Book Center around 1.30 pm and opened fire when the owner Sunil Singh and three employees were present. ""He pointed a gun, his hands trembling when he pressed the trigger.""

""After firing, he threw a chit at me in which my brother's name was scribbled in Hindi. He demanded extortion money,'' said Singh.

The assailant then targeted Rokadia Traders. Akash Jain told TOI, ""My brother Vikas was near the counter when the man pointed a gun. As he fired, Vikas ducked. The bullet pierced the roof.""

CHENNAI: With no major cold spells so far, winter, which has been subdued so far, is almost over. Weathermen have forecast the present trend of hot days and warm nights to continue in the coming days due to persisting easterlies.

""Sky condition likely to be partly cloudy. Maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to be around 32°C and 23°C for the next 48 hours in the city,"" IMD said in its forecast.

On Saturday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 32.2°C at Nungambakkam and 31.8°C at Meenambakkam - 1.2°C and 1.5°C normal.

Experts said the southern region, including coastal cities such as Chennai, experiences above-normal temperatures due to persisting easterlies. Usually, Chennai has cooler nights with temperatures dropping below 18°C or 19°C when cold northerly winds move southwards during January and February.

But this year, easterly winds have been consistently blowing since the end of the northeast monsoon and northerly winds have been absent.

""There's no sign of northerly winds. The present above-normal temperatures will continue. Though the long range forecast for winter for the Indian region was warm, northern regions like Delhi, Punjab and Rajasthan have been experiencing extremely cold conditions while the southern region has been warm,"" said N Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, IMD, Chennai.

MUMBAI: Attempts by Mumbai Police and some groups to call off a protest against CAA and NCR at Mordell Road at Mumbai Central resulted in the crowd multiplying after the women refused to leave the spot. The agitation gained popularity as ' Mumbai Bagh ' since it is similar to the month-long protest being held at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi.

On Saturday, police personnel told volunteers to vacate the area as they did not have permission to stage a protest. While people were being told to leave, a human chain was formed around the site to prevent police from evicting the protesters, who are mostly women. ""Some people had left the spot, but suddenly, within 30 minutes, a huge crowd of women who did not know that the protest was being called off, reached the site and refused to leave. Seeing them, other women who were packing up or had left, returned and refused to leave,"" said Mohammad Rizwan Shaikh, a volunteer managing the crowd.

Shaikh said that on the first day there were 100-odd people, largely women, but on Saturday the number was around 2,000. A volunteer said they were concerned after a person had fired at a protest at Jamia Millia University and another fired at the protest at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, so they decided to call off the protest.

The sit-in entered its sixth day on Saturday, with the entire neighbourhood coming together to help each other. They arranged chairs for the elderly, provided tea to beat the night cold and passed around food. ""We were not told by anyone to sit on a protest. We came here on the first day on our own, and have been peacefully protesting against what we think is wrong. We will leave when we want to,"" said Faiza Ahmad, who lives near the protest site.

DCP (zone III) Abhinash Kumar said the protest began around 2pm and personnel had been deployed. The problem began in the evening. ""Locals said they wanted to end the protest as they had not take permission and would continue after they got it but some others were against it. This led to verbal clashes but there was no violence,"" said Kumar.

By: Rudrika Iyer

MUMBAI: The term ""anti-national"" has been repeated so many times, that it has lost its meaning in our nation, said Aishe Ghosh , president of JNU Students' Union. Ghosh was speaking at Mumbai Collective, a gathering of city's intelligentsia, organised at Y B Chavan Centre, Nariman Point.

The two-day event will see speakers from across the spectrum, including social activists, politicians and intellectuals.

Ghosh said that when Union minister of state Anurag Thakur says ""shoot bullets"", it is not considered ""anti-national"", if somebody comes forward with a gun, that won't be called ""anti national"", but if the child of a Dalit comes and asks for education, his caste will be questioned and he will be called ""anti-national"".

She said the government was trying to de-legitimise other struggles in the country in the name of Jamia and JNU. ""We can't forget the other colleges that are also fighting. It is important to recognise students' protest over fee hikes...,"" said Ghosh. She added that protests across the country at TISS, in Hyderabad, or in Assam or Jammu & Kashmir need to be recognised as they are part of the fight.

She said that being a good student was not only about getting 99/100 in exams, but about understanding and learning civics and democracy too, and she was proud that students today were doing that.

""The meaning of a 'student' is not only about reading a history book and learning what Hitler did. A student is one who understands things and finds similarities in our country...,"" she said.

370,['2/02/2020'],Kolkata port staff worry over corporatisation,"This story is from February 2, 2020

File photo used for representational purpose

KOLKATA: Which major port in the country will the Centre choose to corporatise in order to improve efficiency?

While Nirmala Sitharaman dropped no hints in her Budget speech, officials at Kolkata Port Trust , now renamed Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port Trust (SPMPT), are keeping their fingers crossed. For the first time in 20 years, the port has registered a net profit. More importantly, it has finally shed its pension liabilities and the profit figure will grow exponentially in the years to come.

“We can’t say which port will be chosen. Though draft is a problem at both Kolkata and Haldia, SPMPT has several advantages. It handles the largest number of ships am-ong India’s major ports. It has started utilising the nearly 50-metre draft at the Sandheads to handle cape-size vessels. This is adding to the volume of cargo and revenue. Container handling has also grown in the port and it is located at a crucial junction from where inland water trade can be controlled not only within India but also to Bangladesh,” an official said.

While being liability-free may make SPMPT attractive for corporatisation , employees are worried that this may result in downsizing. Employees fear that once any attempt is made to corporatise the port, investors will be on the lookout for a leaner entity with outsourcing of jobs. The port’s large landholding may also make it attractive to private investors, they feel.

Garden Reach Shipbuild-ers and Engineers in Kolkata has already been corporatis-ed by the defence ministry. So has Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation . At both places, there is a rush now to bag fresh orders to keep shareholders satisfied.

MUMBAI: Lakhs of residents in parts of the suburbs faced a difficult time over a couple of days due to non-availability of drinking water after a pipeline got damaged at Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road when work on the Metro was on. Even as households ran dry—with not a drop to drink, literally—the municipal authorities and the agency implementing the Metro work passed the buck to one another.Trouble started on Thursday evening after the pipeline got punctured during piling work on metro line VI, said officials. The piling rig drill got stuck into the pipeline. even as officials tried to divert flow of water into a storm water drain to avoid a soggy mess on the street as it would lead to a traffic jam.At the time of filing this report on Saturday evening, the BMC claimed it had completed repair work to the damaged pipeline and said normal supply would be restored from Sunday.A group of people from Jogeshwari spilled onto the streets, protesting against the authorities. They blocked vehicular traffic on Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road briefly on Saturday afternoon.The damage to the pipeline compelled residents to arrange for tankers to supply water to their homes. The crisis affected not only households, but also commercial establishments. Parts of Bandra, Khar, Santacruz were affected only on the western side while residents of Vile Parle, Andheri, Jogeshwari in the west and east were severely hit due to shortage of water. In Goregaon, only the eastern side was affected. In the central suburbs, parts of the western side of Kurla and Ghatkopar faced severe shortage.BMC officials claimed that they had arranged water tankers from elsewhere in the city and provided free water to citizen who had called them for help. However, residents had a different story to tell.Farzana Shaikh, a resident of Daswani Society at Four Bungalows in Andheri (west), said her entire locality had been affected since Thursday. “We called BMC officials but got no help... We tried to arrange water through tankers and even offered to pay extra, but got nor esponse. For two days, we somehow managed with the supply from a ring well in our building... On the third day, we had to purchase mineral water...”However, demand for mineral water had surged due to paucity of water in the suburbs, said a resident of Andheri (east). “I had sent my employee to a couple of big shops in my locality to buy gallons of mineral water, but they had all run out of mineral water,” said the resident.Corporator from Bandra Asif Zakaria (Congress) said only a few pockets were supplied water by the BMC. “The rest struggled to get tankers. There was no Plan B in place to deal with the emergency,” he said.The region’s development agency, MMRDA, which is implementing the metro rail work, said that the BMC to blame. A senior MMRDA official monitoring the situation said that before they started piling work for the Metro VI line, they had requested the BMC to provide marking of underground utilities that snake beneath the road.“Our engineers had not been informed specifically about this 1,800mm, major utility lying 9 metres beneath the ground,” said an MMRDA official. “So, unfortunately this led to damage to the pipeline.”BMC officials said their priority was to repair the pipeline at the earliest. “We had provided all details to MMDRA,” said a BMC official. “If there are specific allegations, I will be able to comment only after examining our records.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73858975,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-994087,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/damage-to-water-pipeline-leaves-suburbs-thirsty-bmc-mmrda-play-blame-game/articleshow/73858942.cms

MUMBAI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Saturday the government will actively pursue the 508km bullet train project between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, which has been facing challenges on the land acquisition front in Maharashtra. The FM also announced more Tejas-like trains, including 150 on a public- private partnership basis. Most of these trains will run on the Mumbai-Delhi and Howrah-Delhi routes as there will be capacity augmentation due to commissioning of dedicated freight corridors.

A Western Railway official said, ""The Mumbai-Ahmedabad Tejas Express has been a huge hit. We can run more trains on Mumbai-Delhi and Mumbai-Jaipur routes. While Mumbai-Ahmedabad Tejas has chair cars, other private trains with over 16-hour journey will have sleeper berths."" The railways have also approved a plan to improve tracks on these two routes to allow trains to run at 160kmph, which has been proposed as the speed limit for private services. To provide comfort to private players, the railways will not run regular services on the same route within 15 minutes of the scheduled operation of the private train.

Rai Enclave at Sunny Park

KOLKATA: A 23-year-old domestic help survived an attack on her life after a car cleaner in a posh Sunny Park apartment slashed her neck with a knife on Saturday. The incident took place when flat owner, 80-year-old Brijendra Kumar Gupta, who along with his sons runs an international optical retail firm, was taking rest. The help, Pallavi Gupta, who has been with the Guptas for seven years, remains critical.

The incident took place around 3:35pm at Rai Enclave. There were two maids at home at that time. Gupta’s sons stay in adjacent flats. The cleaner, identified as Monojit Maiti (24), who’s a resident of Egra, rang the doorbell. One of the maids opened the door. When Maiti asked for car keys, the maid called Pallavi alias Pinki, the other domestic help. Pallavi handed him the car keys and asked why he came so late. At this, Maiti attacked her with a knife and fled with the car keys. Pallavi was rushed to a hospital. Police said they arrested Maiti from Gariahat Road-Suren Tagore Road crossing. Prima facie, police said the attack was a result of “personal grudge”.

Delhi Police is on the alert to avert a confrontation at Shaheen Bagh. (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police is on the alert to avert a confrontation at Shaheen Bagh after right-wing organisation Hindu Sena threatened to march to the site of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest where the Kalindi Kunj road has been blocked by protesters for around 50 days now.

Speaking to TOI, Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta said his group had decided some days ago to march to Shaheen Bagh. “These anti-national protesters have blocked the road and are not listening to police or the courts. People there are giving speeches against the Hindus and trying to divide this country,” he alleged.

Delhi Police has made elaborate arrangements to ensure there are no untoward incidents. Mandeep Randhawa, PRO, Delhi Police, said, “We have not given any permission to Hindu Sena. They will not be allowed to march to Shaheen Bagh. We will have police deployed there for this.”

A message circulated by Hindu Sena to ask people for support said, “The ‘jihadis’ at Shaheen Bagh need to vacate the blocked road and we must all reach there. Delhi wants freedom from traitors and these middlemen of Pakistan.” Gupta confirmed it was a message sent by his organisation. He also said that the fringe group felt it was its responsibility to tackle the protesters. “The anger among the people is rising,” he said. “Firing karne par majboor ho gaye hain (people are now forced to resort to guns).”

Gupta said he was not against the residents demonstrating against CAA, but wanted them to express their resentment in a place allowed by law, such the usual protest sites of Ramlila Maidan and Jantar Mantar. “I also don’t support any form of violence,” added Gupta.

Police will be on their toes because UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath is also slated to hold election rallies on Sunday in Okhla and Tughlakabad, both not too far from Shaheen Bagh.

Meanwhile, Updesh Rana, whose name had popped up on the Facebook wall of the youth who fired at a Jamia Millia Islamia student on Thursday, claimed neither to have met the shooter nor to be aware of the teenager’s motives. Rana who is a Meerut native, has been living in Surat in Gujarat for the past two years and was in Bihar on Saturday for an event. He is the national president of NGO Youth Brigade.

He told TOI, “I will always support anything that is in the nation’s favour. I don’t know this boy who used a gun. Many people meet me at my programmes and click pictures with me.” Rana also claimed that he didn’t appreciate anyone resorting to violence. He did, however, reveal that he has called for a rally to get the Kalindi Kunj road vacated on February 9. “If these people can protest, so can we to get the road opened,” Rana asserted.

Office of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike

BENGALURU: The stretch from Teachers' Training College to South End Circle on RV Road will be closed for traffic for over a month with BBMP commencing whitetopping on Sunday.

Commuters travelling towards Jayanagar and JP Nagar from Lalbagh West Gate are supposed to take a left at the college, proceed towards Ashoka Pillar, take a right towards Patalamma Temple and reach South End Circle.

""We require 14 days for curing the concrete,"" a BBMP official said while maintaining that measures have been taken to ensure there is no delay. After he stretch is whitetopped, the agency plans to take up work on the stretch from Teachers' Training College to Lalbagh West Gate.

While BBMP claims the stret ch will have no potholes after whitetopping, many netizens took potshots at the civic agency for failing to prioritise work. ""White topping on already good road, while Mahadevapura runs on mud road (sic),"" a tweet read pointing out how BBMP was redoing good roads while many remain unattended for decades.

Daily users were not enthused as whitetopping will add to their misery. ""Metro construction, flyover demolition and white topping all in one area... Great concern for public convenience (sic),"" mocked another netizen.

""Sir, why not focus on roads that have gone bad. Why rip apart good roads and block them for months for whitetopping (sic),"" a resident asked the BBMP commissioner.

BENGALURU: The fare structure of commuter trains that will run on the proposed 148-km suburban network will be similar to that of the Metro, according to the 2020-21 Union Budget unveiled on Saturday.

This essentially means there won’t be a major difference between the ticket prices of Metro and suburban rail in Bengaluru, unlike in Mumbai and Chennai where rail commute costs much less than Metro trips, according to a railway official.

“The 148-km-long Bengaluru suburban transport project, with a cost of Rs 18,600 crore, will have fares on the Metro model. The central government will provide 20% of the equity and facilitate external assistance of up to 60% of the project cost,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in Parliament.

The Bengaluru suburban rail project is yet to take shape, facing repeated planning delays. The project cost, however, has already increased by Rs 1,600 crore. In 2018-19 Budget, the then finance minister Arun Jaitley, had mentioned Rs 17,000 crore as the cost of developing a 160-km suburban rail network.

The Indian Railways’ 2018-19 ‘Pink Book’, which follows the budget proposal and lists funding for projects, had mentioned an allocation of only Rs 1 crore for the year for the Bengaluru suburban rail. In 2019-20 Pink Book, the amount was Rs 10 crore. This year’s allocation will be known after the document is tabled in Parliament next week, mostly February 5.

When will the wait end?

Transport experts and Bengalureans who have been tracking the project were not impressed by the budget announcement, saying 37 years had passed, but there had been little progress on the ground.

In July 2019, RITES, a government undertaking, submitted a revised detailed project report to the railways. It included four corridors: KSR Bengaluru City Devanahalli, Byappanahalli-Chikkabanavara, Kengeri-Cantonment-Whitefield, and Heelalige-Rajanukunte. The number of suburban stations was reduced to 53 from 82 proposed earlier, and the length of the network was also revised from 161km to 148km.

In November 2019, the Railway Board cleared the project. The final cabinet note is yet to be processed by the finance ministry. Once that happens, it will be placed before the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.

The network that rail planners have envisioned is likely to be the country’s first modern suburban train system. Its stations will have a different look than traditional stations, offering more facilities. There will be automated fare collection gates for cashless travel. Fiftythree air-conditioned trains, with automated sliding doors, will be deployed in the first phase. Railway sources said the minimum fare could be Rs 13 for less than 3km. In Chennai and Mumbai, a train trip for the same distance costs Rs 5 currently. “For a 15-km trip, the fare will be Rs 35 as against Rs 45 in Metro,” an official said.

Dinesh Sharma

LUCKNOW: Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma on Saturday announced that the state government would help in getting innovative and unique science projects patented in the name of students developing them.

Addressing students at the district level science project contest held at a school in Indira Nagar under the ‘Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research’ (Inspire) Award scheme, a flagship programme of central government’s department of science & technology, Sharma said the projects should work in real time, provide solution to problems faced by people and be better than existing technologies.

“The basic and secondary education department will seek legal opinion from experts to ensure that the innovative and unique models are patented,” said Sharma, who also holds the portfolio of secondary and higher education departments. He urged the teachers to encourage the students.

Students of classes 6 to 10 of all basic and secondary schools came up with various science projects to check stress, alarm to keep a tab on glucose in body, flower cleaning machine, smart cap for visually impaired and solar tracker, among others. A total of 32 models were selected by a panel of scientists for the nation-level contest.

FAIZABAD: In a horrifying incident in Barabanki , a man killed his wife, chopped her head and walked all the way along to the police station five kilometres away, holding it by the hair on Saturday afternoon to surrender. Locals and passersby on the route were terrified on witnessing the macabre sight.

The man identified as Akhilesh Rawat (30), a resident of Bahadurpur village in Jahangeerabad police station area of Barabanki district, was arrested. The family of Rawat's wife Ranjana have filed a complaint of dowry death.

As per reports, Rawat beheaded his wife and marched to Jahangeerabad police station which is about five kilometres away from his village, dangling it all the way along. Cops at the police station were shocked when he entered and announced that he has killed his wife.

Barabanki additional superintendent of police R S Gautam told TOI, ""The accused killed his wife Ranjana (24) after both had a fight. He chopped off her head using a sharp-edged sickle. Police have recovered the murder weapon.""

""Ranjana's father Govind has filed a complaint against Rawat, his father, brother and a relative alleging they killed his daughter for dowry,"" the ASP said.

""Three months ago, Ranjana had given birth to a baby girl who died after delivery after which she went to her father's place and had returned to Rawat's residence just four days before.

LUCKNOW: Hair transplant surgery is now also available at dental faculty of King George's Medical University (KGMU).

Dentists at KGMU's oral maxillofacial department performed their first hair transplant on a 32-year-old man from Rae Bareli who was suffering from baldness for five years.

The condition is known as Androgenetic alopecia, common hair loss problem in both men and women, which occurs due to genetic reasons.

As many as 2,000 hair follicles were transplanted on the patient's head during an eight-hour-long procedure by a team of four dentists.

Dean, dental faculty, Prof Shadab Mohammed said the result would be visible in six months and till that time the patient would have to visit them for follow-ups.

Normally, hair transplant is done by a plastic surgeon and KGMU's plastic surgery department has been carrying out hair transplant for long.

Asked if dentists could perform such surgery, KGMU spokesperson Sudhir Singh said, ""All the four dentists have also done a certificate course for this surgery. They are authorised to perform the surgery.""

425,['2/02/2020'],"Modi govt holds its nerve, Budgets for uncertain times","This story is from February 2, 2020

Nirmala Sitharaman (file photo)

Amid the tumult over changes in the Citizenship Act, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is said to have firmly maintained that the support for him which resulted in BJP getting a stunning tally of 303 seats in May last year remains intact. The confidence, which was evident on Friday when he exhorted NDA MPs not to be defensive on CAA , runs through the Budget.

Amid ceaseless commentaries about the economy being in free fall and the warning that the declining GDP numbers amid social unrest could spark the kind of unrest which led to destabilisation of strong regimes in other locales, the government has held its nerve and is going to press along the path that has been attacked by pundits, here as well as abroad. There has been a ‘deviation’ from the fiscal deficit target, but the government has resisted the temptation to abandon the road of rectitude altogether in order to buy peace with sections which are supposed to be sullen.

The money so secured will be spent on infrastructure development which will be of a piece with the vision of a ‘powerful nation’ that Modi has successfully pushed since 2014; something which is also integral to the ‘strong leader’ model associated with him. Proposed changes in the tax regime might disappoint the better off among middle-class taxpayers who stood by him in 2014 and 2019, but perhaps reflects the calculation that a constituency which bought into the ‘nationalism’ and ‘ Hindutva ’ project will not be fickle, at least not so early. This is not an extravagant hope as the enduring popularity of other ‘nationalists’ attests to the power of affectatious polarisation.

The concessions will certainly strengthen Modi’s hold over the ‘aspiring’ ones who have broken into the middle-class category or those who are stuck there: a significant number who have been a big factor in BJP’s success. They, like the multitudes in rural areas, endorsed him on demonetisation and will be pleased with the belated move to strip NRIs of their tax immunity and glamour. Those engaged in farm and allied sectors will be pleased with the attention showered on them. True, the promises made in the last term have not borne fruit. Schemes — from the plan to create a network of warehouses to running of special trains and flights to transport perishable farm produce — are not going to result in tangible benefits immediately. But these can help underpin the promise to remedy the ‘raw deal’ meted out to rural areas and farmers over decades.

The rich will be happy with the attempt to smoothen the rough edges of the I-T department through the taxpayer charter, and the start-up entrepreneur will welcome the relief in taxation on ESOPs.

The outreach to MSMEs and increased duty on imports will help placate constituencies which were aggrieved over reforms like GST. The national combined online recruitment exam will certainly go down well with the ‘aspiring youth’.

The budget is full of big ideas, large infrastructure projects, embrace of technological breakthroughs and the challenges they pose — crucial ingredients which form part of the mystique of ‘the leader’. It factors in shrinking globalisation, reduced power of monetary policy, arrival of data as the new oil as well as disruptors like AI and machine learning.

But its strength lies in not giving offence, NRIs being the sole exception, to any significant section: not a small achievement in times of slowdown and social strife. It shows the PM remains focused on his script of development.

It brings out his belief that he enjoys sufficient support to go ahead and also, that he will soon have money—from access to sovereign wealth funds, sale of government stake, savings through direct benefit transfer as well as increase in revenue when recovery gets underway — to ensure delivery.

LUCKNOW: The murder of a senior citizen found dead in his Saadatganj home locked from outside last week was cracked on Saturday with the arrest of two men, both having criminal record. The two accused had entered the house of the senior citizen living alone on January 21 and strangled him when he caught them stealing.

Police arrested Jameel (42), booked in 21 criminal cases, including theft and attempt to murder, and Dilshad (40), having five criminal cases. On January 20, Hari Shankar Gupta (80) told his neighbours that he was going to KGMU for check-up. When neighbours saw his house locked next day, they informed his brother Ganesh who lodged a missing complaint. On January 24, Ganesh broke the door and found his brother's body on the floor with caustic soda sprinkled all over, legs tied and a cloth wrapped around his neck.

SHO Saadatganj Mahesh Pal Singh said, ""We scanned CCTV footage near the house and saw Jameel moving suspiciously at around 5.55am on January 21. We nabbed him from his rented home in Saadatganj on Saturday. He denied any involvement but when grilled confessed that he and Dilshad had entered Gupta's house through terrace. They found silver coins and Rs 5,000 in a trunk but Gupta woke up on hearing noise. They strangled him, locked the house from outside and fled,"" said Singh.

LUCKNOW: Allocation of Rs 9,500 crore for senior citizens and persons with disability in the Union Budget is set to bring smiles to the faces of lakhs of beneficiaries of welfare schemes in the state.

According to officials of social welfare department, efforts are being made to widen the ambit of schemes to benefit more people and the number of beneficiaries availing pension under welfare schemes for senior citizens and persons with disability is likely to go up by around 10-12%.

They said hefty allocations have been made in the Budget in view of the proposed national social assistance scheme under which pension awarded to the elderly is likely to double in two slabs.

""In senior citizen category, pension may go up to Rs 1,000 per month from existing Rs 500 for those above 80 years of age and to Rs 500 per month from Rs 200 for people in the age group of 60-79 years,"" a senior officer said, adding that beneficiaries would increase in rural areas as it had higher population of elderly people.

""Though a token amount, pension is of great use to the elderly, especially women, who have limited means to fend for themselves,"" said Dr Abhishek Shukla, a city-based private geriatric physician.

Besides the elderly, about 41 lakh differently-abled people in UP may also get benefits.

Out of the total population, about 2% people suffer from disabilities.

Figures shared by the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities show that 31 lakh people with disabilities belong to rural UP while 10 lakh are from urban areas.

Genderwise, 23 lakh are male and 18 lakh are female.

""Higher allocations will certainly benefit disabled people but as of now we don't know the exact benefits they will receive,"" an official said.

The garbage processing plant in Sector 25, Chandigarh

CHANDIGARH: Jaypee company owner Manoj Gaur on Saturday asked for some more time from the Municipal Corporation, Chandigarh, to think over the issue of handing over the city's garbage processing plant to the civic body. He said huge financial investment was involved in the project and his emotions were linked with the plant. Though sources revealed that Gaur had indicated at right and reasonable salvage value, if any discussion over the handing over of the plant is discussed later, but since he had asked for time to think, the civic body would wait for his decision during the next meeting.

Gaur, who, along with his administrative and technical team, held a meeting with the MC, chaired by mayor Rajbala Malik and municipal commissioner K K Yadav, along with officers concerned, took over two hours to deliberate on this issue. During the meeting, besides the financial component, both administrative and legal aspects were also discussed in detail.

""Since significant investment is involved in setting up of the plant, it will surely have the issue of salvage value and thus financial component is quite crucial. If Jaypee makes up mind to hand over the plant, then an independent evaluator can be engaged to come up the with the financial component of salvage value and discussion can be held on the same. Our key motive is to solve the problem at any cost,"" sources in the MC revealed.

While discussing the issue, the MC tried to convince Gaur and his team that the ongoing scenario with regard to the plant is not in favour of anybody and was affecting the city a lot as residents were suffering from foul smell emanating from the plant on a regular basis.

""The current scenario of the plant is neither in your (Jaypee company) favour, nor in MC's favour and the litigation is not good for any party. Therefore, the matter needs to be solved amicably for the overall betterment of the city,"" MC told Gaur.

During the discussion, Jaypee raised the issue of tipping fee again and asked the MC to think over that. But like earlier, the civic body authority once again outrightly refused to give tipping fee to Jaypee.

Gaur's meeting with the MC had come following a meeting with company's director Rajvijay last week. As the MC had refused to hold discussion with Ranvijay and had asked him to bring owner of the company Manoj Gaur for a meeting to discuss the issue, Gaur came on Saturday and discussed the same.

The Union Budget saw the government more than doubling the allocation for the Chabahar port project in Iran whose fate was the subject of much speculation recently because of increased US-Iran tensions. While the allocation in the last Budget was Rs 45 crore, it has been increased to Rs 100 crore this year.

While India has practically stopped importing crude from Iran under pressure from the US, it has remained committed to development of Chabahar port which allows it access to Afghanistan and central Asia bypassing Pakistan.

India’s total allocation for the immediate neighbourhood (Afghanistan, Maldives, Bangladesh , Nepal, Bhutan , Myanmar and Sri Lanka) in 2020-21 is Rs 5,084.65 crore. The figure for last year was Rs 5,652 crore. Even the total budget for the MEA has gone down by more than Rs 500 crore — from Rs 17,884 crore last year to Rs 17, 346 crore.

The biggest loss in terms of aid to countries has been for Nepal whose allocation has gone down from Rs 1,200 crore to Rs 800 crore. The biggest gainer, like last year, has been Bhutan. For overall international cooperation, the budget has been increased from Rs 448 crore to Rs 509 crore.

435,['2/02/2020'],Noida: Worker dies as ammonia leaks at Haldiram’s factory in Sector 65,"This story is from February 2, 2020

An NDRF team sprays water

NOIDA: A 42-year-old worker died and six of his colleagues lost consciousness after a pipe supplying ammonia exploded and the gas leaked at a Haldiram manufacturing unit in Sector 65 on Saturday.

There were more than 300 people at the factory when the pipe supplying ammonia to the freezer of the processing unit exploded around noon. People who were around the pipe at that time complained of burns, nausea, and lost consciousness after some time.

PC Mishra, administrator at the factory, said the internal fire systems were immediately activated and the injured persons were rushed to the nearby Global and Tripathi hospitals. “The injured persons were given immediate treatment and their condition was stated to be stable. But, Sanjeev Kumar, who worked as an operator at the Haldiram’s unit, was declared dead on arrival at Tripathi hospital,” he said.

Kumar, originally from Meerut, had joined Haldiram’s only a month ago. “Along with him was 18-year-old Rupesh. He is being treated in ICU,” Mishra said. After the pipe exploded and gas started showing its effect, the workers at the plant were told to evacuate the building immediately. Water was sprinkled so that the gas settled down to some extent. NDRF teams, fire department and police arrived within half an hour.

RS Kushwaha, deputy commandant of the NDRF unit in Ghaziabad, said they received a call about the gas leak around 12.30pm. “By the time we reached, people there had turned off the gas regulators. We neutralised the contaminants and washed the floors using ‘fast act’ chemicals. It took almost an hour to completely disperse the gas,” he said.

The Haldiram’s plant is divided into four blocks, of which one is under construction. The three blocks are currently used for cooking, processing and packaging.

“We use ammonia as a cooling agent in the processing unit, where it is kept in three condensers. There are three pipes to channel the gas to the freezer. One of these pipes exploded,” the plant administrator told TOI.

The leaking gas had a cascading effect on workers at an adjoining building too. Rehmat Ali , who works with Fine Lines located behind the Haldiram’s plant, said he heard a loud explosion and a pungent smell followed. “There was a burning sensation in our eyes and skin. It started feeling nauseating ,” Ali said.

DCP Harish Chander said the effect of the leaking gas could have been worse had the NDRF team not arrived in time from Ghaziabad. “Police had also reached the spot in time and a thorough inspection of the spot was done. The NDRF team also examined the situation and brought it under control within two hours,” he said.

Sanjeev’s body would be handed over to his family after an autopsy, Chander said. The officer added a case would be lodged if a complaint was filed at the local police station.

GHAZIABAD: Three youths, including a Class 12 and a Delhi University student, have been arrested for allegedly killing a medical store owner in Loni Border area.

Shavez Mirza (21) was allegedly shot dead by three bike-borne miscreants on January 28 in Loni’s Arya Nagar colony. At the time of the crime, Shavez was standing outside his medical store.

According to the police, the assailants have been identified as Adil Khan (20), BCom student from Delhi University, Sumit Kumar (20), pursuing ITI course from Ghaziabad and Abhay alias Kallu, Class 12 (Arts) student from a private school in Ghaziabad.

Meanwhile, two other youths who were involved in the crime are absconding and were identified as Robin and Badal. All belong to Loni.

Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, SP (Rural) told TOI that Adil works in a medical shop as a part time employee. On January 28, Sadab, a friend of Shavez had gone to Adil to ask for some cash. Adil said no customer had arrived till that time therefore there was not enough cash available in the shop. On that, they both had an argument which lead to a fight.

“Shavez interfered and separated them. Later, Adil told Badal about the argument following which Badal along with his friends came to beat Sadab but Shavez came in between to help his friend. Badal called over some more friends. Meanwhile, Adil and Sumit passed the information about Shavez’s location. Abhay was riding the bike and Robin and Badal were seated behind. They called Shavez outside and shot a bullet in his head and fled,” the SP added.

Police have also recovered a country-made pistol and the motorcycle used in the crime from the possession of the arrested men. All three have been sent to jail after producing them into a court.

Sidhu Moose Wala

BATHINDA: Mansa police have registered a case against Punjabi singer Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu, popularly known as Sidhu Moose Wala , and Mankirat Aulakh for a video clip shown in social media which propagates violence.

The case was registerted at Mansa sadar police station on Saturday under sections 294 (sings, recites or utters any obscene song), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 149 (unlawful assembly) of the IPC.

On January 12, Chandigarh-based advocate Hari Chand Arora had sent a notice to the Punjab Police DGP and the senior superintendent of police, Mansa, to take action against Moosewala and his companion for a video on YouTube, which propagates violence. Citing a 2019 judgment of the Punjab and Haryana high court, wherein the DGP was directed to ensure that no songs glorifying liquor, wine, drugs and violence are played and SSPs to be personally responsible to ensure due compliance of directions, Arora had asked the officers to act in the matter in 10 days, failing which he would move appropriate proceedings under the Contempt of Courts Act before the high court for purported non-compliance of the directions. He had sent the copy of high court order of July 22, 2019 and CD of the video being shown on YouTube.

Although the song — Pakhia pakhia pakhia, gun wich panj goliya ni tere panj veera lei rakhiya... (Pakhia pakhia pakhia, there are five bullets in the gun, which I have kept for your five brothers...) — was released in 2013, it was uploaded on YouTube on November 27, 2019.

“I had sent the notice to the DGP and the Mansa SSP along with a copy of judgment and copy of CD of the video uploaded on YouTube after recording... Now, a case has been registered on his complaint,” said Arora.

Mansa Sadar police station SHO Balwinder Singh said, “A case has been registered against Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu and Mankirat Singh under relevant sections and the matter is being investigated.”

Moosewala was not available for comments.

VADODARA: Gujarat may boast of the longest coastline in the country. But when it comes to security infrastructure meant for protecting the coast of about 1,600 kilometres, the state lags behind other coastal states.Time and again, the coastlines of the state have been put on high alert due to the state’s proximity to Pakistan. But with the limitations of infrastructure, there is little that the marine police can do. The Data on Police Organizations, 2019, released by the Union ministry of home affairs on Wednesday shows that many other states which are far away from Pakistan and have shorter coastline have a greater number of marine police stations .With just 22 police stations and 30 interceptor boats, each marine police station is tasked with covering an average coastline area of over 72 kilometres. The Gujarat police has planned to add 13 more marine police stations under Phase-III, but it is highly unlikely to come up any time soon. According to senior police officials, the Phase-II will end only this year. Every police station in Karnataka is responsible for average coastline of 5 kilometres, in Maharashtra this area is 16 kilometres and in Tamil Nadu and Odisha it is 25 and 26 kilometres respectively.“Our structure is different from other states’ structures. We have 22 police stations, but there are 45 outposts and chowkis, and we have expanded our manpower,” said deputy inspector general of police Himanshu Shukla of Marine Task Force. Shukla said that Gujarat is the only coastal state in the country to have a force of special Marine Task Commandos.The current infrastructure also took 14 years to come up. The marine police in Gujarat was inaugurated in 2006 and it is jointly funded by the state and central government under the coastal security scheme.In response to a question in the Gujarat assembly last July, MoS Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja had stated that besides the 1,640 km coastline, there are also 144 islands off the coast, of which six have human habitation.The coastal security assumes significance in the light of 26/11 terror attacks of Mumbai in 2008 when 10 LeT members had hijacked a fishing boat ‘Kuber’ off Gujarat coast.",vadodara,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73859995,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-139987,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/gujarat-only-22-marine-police-stations-for-1600km-coast/articleshow/73859961.cms

The proposed landfill site is located in Dostpur Mangrauli village.

NOIDA: While the Noida Authority has finally identified a permanent landfill site in Dostpur Mangrauli village, after 42 years of its inception, the land still needs to be bought from the stakeholders, following the approval of the project by the district administration as well as the National Green Tribunal ( NGT ).

The new site is facing sectors 162 and 164, between the Yamuna checkdam and the DFCC corridor that is under construction. Officials said the project proposal has been sent to the Gautam Budh Nagar magistrate for approval as the site fulfils all criteria under the solid waste management (SWM) rules and is about 500 metres away from any habitation and the Yamuna river. Most of the land is currently agricultural.

“There is no habitation in the vicinity as of now and in future as well there will be no settlement at least 400-500 metres from the landfill site. Even after settlement, this area will mainly have industries and farmhouses. The Yamuna bank is also around 400 metres away. We have kept all parameters in mind for site selection as per the SWM Rules, 2014,” said Avinash Tripathy, OSD, Noida Authority.

Though officials claim that the site is at a considerable distance from the river, it still falls in the riverbed area. “Considering the proximity of the site to the river, we will build another checkdam near the existing one to prevent leachate or seepage towards the Yamuna,” added Tripathy.

“Once the land is bought, it will also need approvals from the irrigation department, the pollution control board and NGT,” another official said.

GREATER NOIDA: The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) conducted a day-long consultation workshop on Saturday to prepare conservation plans for birds and animals that will be affected by the upcoming Jewar international airport.Experts from the wildlife community, residents and environmental activists suggested several conservation steps for sarus and blackbuck habitats.An animal rescue centre has been proposed keeping in view the potential increase in population in the area. Meanwhile, experts said smaller shallow wetlands should be restored so that the sarus cranes can move there along with developing ‘Sarus Mitras’, which helps increase the bird population and also protects their nests.“Uttar Pradesh has an active society for protection of sarus crane and similar steps should be taken here as well. It’s important for the authorities to restore smaller wetlands that are home to sarus and the area being taken away should be adequately compensated. But, these small wetlands should be at least 10 kilometres away,” said Asad Rahmani, member of Governing Body of Wetlands International South Asia and former Director of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS).Rahmani suggested that locals could be motivated to protect Sarus nests. He said the restored habitats must be protected through minimum intervention. “There should be no garbage dumping around the airport as it attracts the birds,” he said.At the workshop, waste management steps and future noise pollution levels were also discussed. While it was mentioned that blackbucks can be translocated, it disturbs their population. Also, during the construction phase, animals may enter the inhabited area and get killed. “We’ll discuss the proposal with YEIDA,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer.WII officials said all the suggestions will be incorporated in the final proposal for the airport. “While we have submitted our inception report to the government, our study is still going on.

GURUGRAM: A group of men fired at a van and snatched two murder accused from the clutches of a police team in Faridabad on Saturday. However, one of the two prisoners and two men who had come to free him were arrested following a brief chase and exchange of fire. The other murder accused managed to escape.

Sandeep and Dhan Singh were among five inmates of Bhondsi jail who had been taken to a Faridabad court earlier in the day for a hearing. They were on their way back when their accomplices came in two vehicles and attacked the police van near Hanuman Chowk in Faridabad. An assistant sub-inspector, Jitender, was injured in the cross-firing, but was stated to be out of danger.

Faridabad commissioner of police KK Rao said the police team was caught unawares when the gang came in two vehicles and sprayed bullets on the van carrying the prisoners.

“The men who had come to free the prisoners were stopped at a check-post,” said Rao. They left the vehicles and started running towards a field. After a brief exchange of fire, Dhan Singh, and two of his accomplices — Kapil and Naresh Sethi — were nabbed. Sandeep and a few others managed to flee. At least 10 pistols and 200 live cartridges were found on them.

Sandeep, an accused in at least 12 cases of murder, had been in jail since March 2012. He was serving life term in one of these cases. Police said Sandeep was active in Sonipat, Rohtak, Jhajjar, Hisar and parts of Delhi, and had been lodged in Hisar central jail.

When in jail, Sandeep came in contact with gangster Anil Chitte, who was later killed after being released in 2015. He was also in touch with members of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang. “Sandeep and his accomplices were operating gangs from inside the jail,” said a police source. It was only last month that Sandeep was shifted to Bhondsi jail. “His gang thrived on extortions from toll operators and businessmen,” the source said.

On December 31, an undertrial from Bhondsi jail had managed to escape after spraying pepper into the eyes of policemen outside Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi.

Naresh (33) and a few other prisoners from Bhondsi jail had been taken to Safdarjung for a check-up. Sub-inspector Shyam Pool had just stepped out of the police van, when three men came running and fired in the air. Naresh sprayed pepper into the eyes of Shyam and escaped with the help of his accomplices.

Faridabad commissioner of police KK Rao said the police team was caught unawares when the gang came in two vehicles and sprayed bullets on the van carrying the prisoners.

“The men who had come to free the prisoners were stopped at a check-post,” said Rao. They left the vehicles and started running towards a field. After a brief exchange of fire, Dhan Singh, and two of his accomplices — Kapil and Naresh Sethi — were nabbed. Sandeep and a few others managed to flee. At least 10 pistols and 200 live cartridges were found on them.

Sandeep, an accused in at least 12 cases of murder, had been in jail since March 2012. He was serving life term in one of these cases. Police said Sandeep was active in Sonipat, Rohtak, Jhajjar, Hisar and parts of Delhi, and had been lodged in Hisar central jail.

When in jail, Sandeep came in contact with gangster Anil Chitte, who was later killed after being released in 2015. He was also in touch with members of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang. “Sandeep and his accomplices were operating gangs from inside the jail,” said a police source. It was only last month that Sandeep was shifted to Bhondsi jail. “His gang thrived on extortions from toll operators and businessmen,” the source said.

On December 31, an undertrial from Bhondsi jail had managed to escape after spraying pepper into the eyes of policemen outside Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi.

Naresh (33) and a few other prisoners from Bhondsi jail had been taken to Safdarjung for a check-up. Sub-inspector Shyam Pool had just stepped out of the police van, when three men came running and fired in the air. Naresh sprayed pepper into the eyes of Shyam and escaped with the help of his accomplices.

GHAZIABAD: Police have identified 28 hotspots across the district that are popular points for selling of narcotic items. The places that have been identified are New Bus Stand, Old Bus Stand, Sabzi Mandi in Ghantaghar, railway station, near some schools, parks and other places.

SSP Kalanidhi Naithani told TOI that he has already directed all the concerned police officers of the hotspot areas to arrest the drug peddlers and reach their main supplier. “If any concerned police officer fails to do so, I will take strict action against the officer because they are responsible for any illegal activity in their jurisdiction,” he added.

While domestic drugs like marijuana, hashish and sulfa are smuggled through land routes from Rajasthan, Punjab, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur and Bihar. Drugs such as cocaine, LSD and heroin channel their way into the country through the stomachs of human drug mules from Mexico, Peru and Norway, police said.

Naithani said that there are different syndicates operating in Delhi and that they have constituted special teams to crack down on drug smuggling networks in the city and border areas.

“To keep a check on the supply of narcotics , we have deployed cops in civil uniform to keep an eye on all the party destinations across the city and on all inter-city and inter-state border roads,” he added.

GHAZIABAD: The Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation ( GMC ) on Saturday launched an app that will help people to get their pets registered online.

“After several meetings, the GMC board has formulated bylaws under which the licence fee for owning a dog has fixed at Rs 1,000 a year,” said Dinesh Chandra, the municipal commissioner. “Apart from generating revenue through the registrations, this app will also help us compile data on the number of pets in the city,” the official added.

The ‘Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam Pet Registration’ app, which was launched on Saturday, can be downloaded from Google Playstore. “After downloading the app, pet owners will have to get their names registered along with phone numbers. An OTP would be generated to their numbers, following which they can choose options such as new registration, certificate renewal, status of registration and register dogs,” said Anuj Singh, GMC’s veterinary and social welfare officer.

Before registering, owners will have to fill in details like the name of the pet, its age, breed, sex, rabies vaccination details and the next due date.

“A person will also need to upload a photograph of his pet along with relevant documents and his details. Then, they would be directed to pay the annual registration fee of Rs 1,000 and the online process would be complete,” said Singh.

GMC will take at least two working days to process the registration. A registration certificate would be issued only after all documents are found in order. Pet owners have time till March 31 to get their dogs registered.

However, the new bylaws will also require pet owners to follow a few rules. “Residents owning pets will have to intimate GMC within 15 days. They will also have to ensure that their pets are not left unattended in any public area. They would be fined if their pets are found urinating or defecating in the open,” said Singh.

GURUGRAM: The district administration has collected the data of 50,000 families living in Gurugram to make their family ID cards . Under the scheme, the state government aims at creating a database of families in Haryana to deliver all benefits of different citizen-centric services and schemes . Deputy commissioner Amit Khatri held a meeting in which he said a total of 63 camps have been set up so far in the district to spread awareness about the scheme.

“The residents can register themselves for family ID cards in Atal Sewa Kendra to avail benefits of various schemes rolled out by the state government,” said Khatri. The deputy commissioner also said the administration has been organising camps at different places for registrations.

Khatri told the officials in a meeting held on January 29 that the family ID cards will have to be made for timely disbursal of benefits.

The families can register online to get their ID cards. Khatri said, for example, when a person turns 60 years and is registered under the family ID scheme, he or she will get an automated message saying he or she is eligible for the old-age pension.

Moreover, Mukhyamantri Parivar Samridhi Yojna was also discussed in the meeting. Under the scheme, the families with an annual income up to Rs 1.80 lakh and those who own not more than five acres of land will be covered.

These families would be given financial assistance of Rs 6,000 per year for the premium to be paid for different schemes.

448,['2/02/2020'],Union Budget 2020: New tax deal for the common man,"Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday rolled out a new optional income tax regime that offers lower rates as a trade-off for foregoing exemptions for annual incomes up to Rs 15 lakh. The move was projected as an effort to provide relief and simplicity to taxpayers, particularly those at lower and middle income levels.The tax structure has been rejigged with the introduction of four thinly-sliced tax slabs between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh with the rate applicable to each of them going down — from 20% to 10% between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 7.5 lakh, from 20% to 15% in the Rs 7.5 lakh-Rs 10 lakh bracket, from 30% to 20% for Rs 10 lakh-Rs 12.5 lakh and from 30% to 25% between Rs 12.5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh. In return for the lower taxes, those opting for this new scheme would have to forgo all deductions available under the existing regime.The FM in her speech said this would lead to “substantial tax benefit” and gave the example of a person earning Rs 15 lakh and not using any exemptions now. Such a person, she said, could save Rs 78,000 in tax annually.This optional scheme, the FM said, is estimated to cost the exchequer Rs 40,000 crore a year in foregone I-T revenues. What the speech did not spell out, but the budget documents did, is that the option to choose the new scheme would be reversible for those who do not have any business income.The other major change that will impact individual taxpayers is in dividend distribution tax (DDT) currently imposed on companies or funds. Under DDT, companies or mutual funds pay 15% but dividend income up to Rs 10 lakh annually is not added to a person’s taxable income. The Budget has scrapped DDT; dividend income will henceforth form part of an individual’s taxable income. That means it could be taxed at up to 42.7%, the highest rate of tax including surcharges and cesses. The move is seen as a big disincentive for those using investments as tax saving instruments and could explain much of the market’s negative reaction to the Budget.The FM promised that a “taxpayers charter” clearly enumerating their rights would soon be made part of the statutes. The details of the charter were, however, not spelt out in the Budget speech. The purpose of the charter, according to the FM, is to establish trust between the taxpayer and the tax administration.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73860752,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-158597,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/new-tax-deal-for-the-common-man/articleshow/73859884.cms

GURUGRAM: Residents of Vipul Lavanya in Sector 81 have approached the authorities against the developer for abruptly increasing the quarterly maintenance charges of the housing society without their consent.

In a letter to the department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Friday, the residents alleged that the developer had increased the upkeep charges from Rs 2.50 per sq ft to Rs 3.99 per sq ft from this quarter without prior consultation even as they were forced to live in unacceptable conditions.

“When the internal roads of the society are crumbling and plaster from the walls are falling off, we need the builder to repair them and not to increase the upkeep fees. The security guards of the society frequently go on strike because of non-payment of their salaries, which is also a big concern for us,” said Amit Shekhar , RWA president.

“The condition of the society is deteriorating with each passing day. We have complained to the builder several times, but no action has been initiated yet. We received an email on January 10 from the developer about the increase in upkeep fee. This is unacceptable,” he added.

“We have requested the developer to provide us the basis for such a hike. The builder has not yet responded to our several emails. On the other hand, the services of the society are deteriorating day by day,” he said.

Despite repeated attempts, the Vipul Lavanya management could not be contacted.

However, DTCP officials said they would look into the issue. “We will speak to both the parties to arrive at a amicable solution,” said a senior official. The society has around 480 flats and some 400 families are currently living there.

Meanwhile, the state BJP unit hailed the budget and called it visionary and development-oriented.

""The budget does not meet the aspirations of the common man. It focusses on the welfare of industrialists and capitalists and increases the troubles of a common man. In her 2.43 hour-long budget speech, the Union finance minister failed to address critical issues like poverty alleviation, inflation and unemployment. There is nothing for the poor, labourers, farmers and the youth of the nation in the budget,"" chief minister Hemant Soren said.

He added, ""We had demanded a tribal university for Jharkhand, but instead, the budget speaks about a tribal museum. This is yet another instance of Adivasis of the state being cheated. The central government has tried to provide relief to those industrialists who indulge in rampant tax evasion, while the middle class has been given only a little relief through income tax."" He further said, ""This budget, which has neither any vision nor any far-reaching impact, also reveals the Centre's plans to privatise government institutions.""

State finance minister and Congress MLA (from Lohardaga) Rameshwar Oraon said, ""The budget is unsatisfactory as no comprehensive steps have been taken for job creation, which is the need of the hour. Merely coining new economic terms will not help."" He added, ""The need of the hour is to address rise of price of essential commodities. Cost of medical appliances too has been increased which will hamper provisions of medical services to the common man.

453,['2/02/2020'],NRI Tax in Budget 2020: NRI definition changed to stop tax avoidance,"This story is from February 2, 2020

The Budget has tightened the screws on those seeking to escape tax by exploiting their non-resident status. While earlier it was possible to be classified as non-resident by staying out of the country for 183 days or about six months in a year, this has now been, in effect, enhanced to 245 days.

The change has been made because some taxpayers divided their time between India and overseas to avoid being categorised as tax residents in India. Once a tax resident is further classified as ordinarily resident (OR), he pays tax in India on his global income, which would include say interest income on overseas bank accounts.

As Parizad Sirwalla , partner and head, global mobility services (tax) at KPMG India points out, “Indian citizens and persons of Indian origin who were on visit to India had an extended period of 182 days of stay in India (as opposed to 60 days) before they could be regarded as a resident from an income tax perspective. This period is proposed to be reduced to 120 days now.”

As things stand, an individual is a resident in India for a particular financial year if he has been here for an overall period of 365 days or more within the four years preceding and an overall period of 60 days in that particular year. The 182-day relaxation was made available to Indian citizens and persons of Indian origin.

‘Only The Stateless Will Be Deemed Indian And Taxed’

The Budget memorandum pointed out that this relaxed duration of 182 days was misused by individuals who had significant economic activity in India (say a business), managed their period of stay, so as to remain a nonresident in perpetuity. With such individuals now being required to stay out of the country for 245 days in a year, the misuse becomes more difficult for those having business interests in India.

Gautam Nayak, tax partner at CNK & Associates cautions, “NRIs or Overseas Citizens of India, visiting relatives in India need to now be more careful and limit their stays to less than 120 days in a year, or else they may face tax on their worldwide income.”

After having determined an individual as a tax resident, there is a secondary test to determine whether the individual qualifies as a not ordinarily resident (NOR) or ordinarily resident (OR). Currently there are complex rules to determine when a person is NOR. This has been simplified to say that a person is NOR for a particular financial year if he has been a non-resident in seven out of the ten preceding years. This determination is critical as while an ‘NOR’ is only taxed on India income, an individual who is an ‘OR’ is taxable on his worldwide income.

Another change made is that an Indian citizen not ‘liable to tax’ in any other country or territory shall be deemed to be resident in India. At first glance, it appeared that India’s diaspora which works in Gulf countries (where there is no tax on individual income) would be badly hit.

However, the Finance Bill added that this would be the case if the individual is not liable to tax in any other country by reason of his domicile, or residence or any other criteria of similar nature. Nayak adds, “The SC in the case of Azadi Bachao Andolan has held that the term ‘liable to tax’ is not the same as ‘is actually taxed’. The OECD Model Tax Convention also provides that a person does not have to be actually paying tax to be “liable to tax”. If the host country chooses not to tax such income, it does not mean that they are not “liable to tax” in that country. They may still not be regarded as residents of India. However, the issue needs to be clarified to avoid litigation. This provision would therefore perhaps only impact those Indian citizens who are not residents of any country at all.”

ANI quoted the revenue secretary, Ajay Bhusan Pandey , as saying that only if an Indian citizen is not a resident of any country in the world, he will be deemed to be a resident of India and his worldwide income will be taxed. Amarpal S Chadha, partner and India mobility leader at EY-India says, “The intent behind this amendment is to tax the Indian citizens who are stateless and enjoy the privilege of not paying taxes in any country or jurisdiction, based on their tax planning. However, a formal clarification on this will be helpful to avoid litigation.”

AMRITSAR: The anti-drug Special Task Force (STF) is likely to summon SAD functionary Anwar Masih to join investigations after the recovery of around 194 kilogram heroin in Amritsar. The narcotics substance’s refining and processing was being done in Masih’s house. Even SAD alliance partner BJP has demanded exemplary action against all those found involved in the drug racket.

Talking to TOI on Saturday, STF inspector general (IG) Kaustubh Sharma said all the six accused were produced in a local court and taken on 10 days remand. He said a notice under section 67 of the NDPS Act would be issued to Masih to join the investigations.

“In due course, all those who are involved in the case, including owner of the house, should be called. Owner is liable under section 25 of the NDPS Act, even if he has not taken due diligence to protect his property, particularly from being used for narcotics,” the IG added.

State BJP president Ashwani Sharma demanded an unbiased investigation into the incident of smuggling and processing of heroin in Amritsar. “Whosoever is found involved in the drug racket should be taken to task and exemplary punishment be awarded to them,” Ashwani said, adding that truth should prevail at all costs.

When asked whether he would take up the issue with SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal , he replied, “I have said what I have to.”

His predecessor and Rajya Sabha member Shwait Malik said, “Recovery of such a huge amount of narcotics from the holy city is worrisome.” He said there was a possibility that many consignments could have already found their way into India undetected.

On the role of SAD leader, he said, “This is not a political issue but an issue of national interest. Strict action should be taken against anyone found involved in the drug racket. Whosoever is guilty, should be behind the bar.”

456,['2/02/2020'],Sector allocation fell from 9.61 per cent to 9.30 per cent: Farm bodies,"This story is from February 2, 2020

The farmers have denounced the claims of the Union Budget that the farm income will be doubled by 2022

BATHINDA: . The farmers have denounced the claims of the Union Budget that the farm income will be doubled by 2022. They said the allocation for agriculture, irrigation, allied activities and rural development & panchayati raj is less than what it was for 2019-20 budget. If it is weighed against the total budget, the allocation has come down from 9.61% to 9.30%. The farmers also have expressed their discontent as the Budget has made no mention of farm debt waiver or implementation of Swaminathan committee recommendations.

Although Budget 2020 has hiked the amount allocated to the farm sector by 5.5% — from Rs 2.68 lakh crore in Budget 2019 to Rs 2.83 lakh crore now — when calculated in terms of percentage of total budget, the allocation has come down. In the previous budget, the allocation for farm sector was Rs. 2.68 lakh crore out of total budget of Rs 27.86 lakh crore which worked out as 9.61% of the total budget. Now, allocation has increased to Rs 2.83 crore but it is out of the enhanced budget of Rs 30.42 lakh crore, which means farm sector gets 9.30% of the pie.

Various farmers’ unions also claim that PM-Kisan scheme was supposed to benefit 12 crore families, but only 6.12 crore beneficiaries got Rs 6,000 in a year. “We were expecting some relief. The government is patting its back only by making small increases in MSP of kharif and rabi crops and providing only Rs 6,000 as relief to farmers which is highly insufficient. We have now lost every faith in the government,” said farm organisation BKU Sidhupur leader Baldev Singh Sandoha .

Even though Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced schemes for farmers, like kisan rail and Krishi udaan, in the budget, including a promise that the government will to invest widely in agricultural infrastructure, the farmers are unhappy that the government is doing nothing about farm debt waiver as well as the implementation of Swaminathan committee recommendations over fixing MSP of crops by including all costs, said activists of farm organisations.

“The farmers and farm labourers are committing suicides across the country. The government held debates over it in parliament, but when it comes to providing relief to aggrieved farmers, the governments prefers to keep mum. We were expecting some announcement on debt waiver,” said farm organisation BKU Ekta Ugrahan general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri .

General secretary of BKU Ekta Dakonda Jagmohan Singh echoed a similar sentiment. “Nothing has been planned to decrease the burden of debt ridden farmers and labourers who are committing suicides.

458,['2/02/2020'],Step-fatherly treatment meted out to Punjab in Union Budget: Amarinder,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh has claimed that the proposed Union Budget was high on pomposity and low on tangibles, in which the state has been meted out step-fatherly treatment.

He said on Saturday that Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman even failed to mention the economic slowdown of 2019-20, and there was nothing in the BJP-led central government’s Budget that could pave the way for economic reforms or revive the economy.

Amarinder pointed out that the 16-point action plan for agriculture in the budget document makes no mention of any initiatives or schemes to encourage crop diversification. As buffer stocks of foodgrain were already putting a strain on states like Punjab and farmers, failure to diversify would further aggravate the problems for the country on the agriculture front, he added.

He also attacked the central government for its “failure to address the concern” of the states, including Punjab, on the delays in release of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) compensation. “Where will we get the money for the development of our state?” Amarinder said. It was really a matter of serious concern for Punjab and other states that the central government had decided to limit the GST compensation fund to collections under GST cess, he added and warned it would further add to the problems of the states.

Capt Amarinder castigated the failure of the central government’s Budget to make any outlay for the celebration of the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev and the upcoming 400th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Teg Bahadur, or for the promotion of Sikh culture and heritage. The central government has excluded Punjab from the districts where the Centre intended to focus on for water conservation, despite the fact that Punjab was severely water-stressed, he said. The chief minister claimed that even the special tourism projects announced in the budget were meant only for BJP-ruled states.

The chief minister also raised questions on the failure of the central government to provide the much-needed push to infrastructure, and strengthen the irrigation and power sectors. He also termed the Rs 10,340 crore hike provided for modernisation of the defence forces and purchase of new weapon systems as a “pathetic joke”. “This is worse than the increment even a clerk expects at the end of the year,” he said.

Amarinder said with a meagre Rs 27,300 crore allocated for promotion of industry and commerce would not help much. Without drawing any roadmap on the way forward, and announcement of grandiose plans to make every district an export hub shows how clueless the government was, alleged the chief minister. The 10% increase in the health sector over last year’s allocation can hardly be termed sufficient for the needs of a nation of billion plus, he said.

Ludhiana: As finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman presented the annual budget on Saturday, this family is not satisfied with the announcements in it, even as it does consider some measures as good ones. Dr Anshu Gupta is a reputed psychiatrist in the city, and his family includes his parents — father Satpaul Gupta (81), a retired professor; mother Sushma Gupta (78), a retired vice-principal of a private college; wife Dr Charu Gupta; and son Prasit (12) — all of whom have a take on the budget.

Reacting to the budget, Anshu said the most important aspect of the budget they wait for is tax rebates, but in the current budget, there is not much for those looking for saving, especially those earning more than Rs5 lakh per annum. He added that they only feel that since the economy has already touched its lowest ebb, there cannot be more bad news on the economic front, but they expected the government to announce new schemes to boost economy and create new jobs. However, he said there were some good initiatives in the budget, including a proposal to start 150 Tejas trains.

His wife Charu said the good thing about the budget was that the government had announced the setting up of more hospitals in the tier-II and III cities under the public-private-partnership (PPP) route. She added, “It is good the government also initiated a programme to set up 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres (HWCs) by 2022. These initiatives will make medicare better and affordable.”

Satpaul is also not happy with the budget, and says there is not much relief to the salaried class , which is grappling with high inflation. He added, “The government has announced it would start five new smart cities, but most of such cities announced by it in the past are yet to be developed.”

His grandson Prasit is, however, happy with the budget. “The government’s proposal to allow foreign investment in the education sector will be good for students, as big universities of the world will set up their centres in India,” said Prasit, who studies in Class VII.

This is a very positive budget and will not only help attract greater investment in India but will also help economy immensely. The abolition of DDT and reduction of corporate tax are big positive indicators and will allow greater investment to come into industry. Overall these two steps will prove to be very beneficial for the business. Overall, I feel this is very good budget as money flow /savings are being increased in the hands of very large number of people. There will be big savings for the middle class due to the substantial reduction in the income tax rates. So if the middle class gets to do savings it will give a big boost to the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) consumption.

Increase in funding for the schemes for weaker sections will lead to increase in the consumption and will be substantially beneficial for all sectors. I believe economy will take off in about three to four months time with these initiatives and by October November we can expect big change. Regarding increased allocations for weaker sections of society, any welfare scheme of this nature result in big increase in consumption. Given this government’s track record of quick disbursal and direct transfer, its effect on our economy is going to be pretty good and will lead to increase in consumptions. I am inclined to believe the finance minister statement that GDP will rise up, though I may not agree with 10% figure but definitely the growth rate would be significantly higher than the last year. The growth rate might start inching upwards quite ramarkbly. This is largely on the basis of increase in expenditures for the weaker sections and decrease in the income tax slabs. Both the factors combined are set to play a big role. These all aspects might not sound great to large number of people right now, but the economic impact of these steps is going to be visible in the coming days.

Chandigarh: SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday termed the Union Budget as pro-farmer and pro-poor.

He said the common man would benefit from reduction in income tax and ground had been laid for achieving a higher gross domestic product (GDP) by giving a boost to digitisation, infrastructure and industry.

Sukhbir welcomed the allocation of Rs 15 lakh crore to agricultural sector and said farmers across the country, including Punjab, would benefit from the government’s decision to go solar by subsidising 20 lakh standalone solar pumps.

Similarly, the decision to set up ‘Kisan Rail’ through public-private partnership (PPP) mode to transport perishable goods quickly as well as Krishi Udaan to transport agriculture goods to national and international destinations would give a much-needed boost to vegetable and horticulture sector in Punjab, he added. “Insurance cover given to six crore farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna is also a path breaking step and will shield farmers from the vagaries of nature,” said the SAD president. He lauded incentives in fish farming and balanced fertilizers.

Sukhbir also lauded the provision of Rs 85,000 crore for the welfare of scheduled castes and backward classes. “This, coupled with the government’s decision to restructure loans of more than five lakh MSMEs, would help in revival of small units,” he said.

Ludhiana: As Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in her budget speech to develop five more ‘Smart’ cities in India, Ludhiana residents questioned the FM’s move while seeking answers on the status of 100 ‘Smart’ cities, including the industrial capital of Punjab, which had been announced earlier.

The residents claimed that Smart City projects had not taken off properly in the city and nothing ‘Smart’ has happened till date. They also claimed that no mention was made about the allocations for the projects this year.

Ludhiana was selected in the first top 20 list to be developed as Smart Cities in January 2016. But even after four years, not many projects have seen completion. Though some projects have made it to the execution stage, the pace has remained slow.

The residents claimed that when the city was selected among the first top 20 smart cities, they had hoped to see a lot of smart things in the city, but nothing has materialized on the ground.

A resident of Model Town, Sunil Sharma asked the FM what happened to earlier Smart City projects which featured Ludhiana as well. He said they do not know the status of Smart City projects and even the ongoing projects are not clear to the residents.

He said there are no boards around the site to educate people about the ongoing projects and also about its completion time. He demanded that instead of making more announcements, previous cities should be developed as smart in the first place.

Rahul Verma, another resident of Sarabha Nagar, said, “The FM should have first elaborated about the status of 100 ‘Smart’ cities, before adding new cities to the list. The Ludhiana smart city officials should also make people aware of the ongoing projects by displaying the plans at the site and giving update from time to time.”

Notably for Ludhiana, DPRs of projects worth Rs 1,000 crore have already been prepared. The officials will not include fresh projects, instead will execute announced projects now.

466,['2/02/2020'],Budget: Little cheer for industry,"This story is from February 2, 2020

Ludhiana: “Wealth creators will be respected in the country,” a remark made by Union finance minister Nirmala Seetharaman on Saturday while presenting her second Union Budget failed to find many takers among corporates as she failed to announce any relief directly related to any industrial sector.

One of the moves which was being projected as her boldest to abolish dividend distribution tax (DDT), which is currently 15% and is paid by the companies on the dividend paid to its shareholders, too failed to cheer up the industrialists as the liability has been passed on to recipients of the dividend.

Besides, the other concern being expressed by the businessmen is about the withdrawal of 70 types of tax exemption about which there is little clarity.

However, the corporates were still happy with the overall budget as they felt that slashing of income tax slabs for middle class and earmarking funds for various schemes like combating pollution are going to contribute to rise in demand of goods and services.

Onkar Singh Pahwa, chairman, Avon Cycles Limited, said “We are very happy with the budget as overall several good decisions have been taken by the Union finance minister, aiming at increasing the spending power of people which in turn will lead to increase in demand of goods and services.”

“Besides reduction in I-T slabs, commitment to boost infrastructure, agriculture, healthcare services and simplifying tax returns and easy resolution of the tax disputes are going to make positive impact on people from all walks of life,” he added.

“We had been demanding reduction in 15% dividend distribution tax (DDT) from the government. Though DDT was abolished today, but it is not going to serve the purpose as the entire load is now going to be passed on to the recipient of the DDT which means that from the present rate of 10% tax, the recipient will now end up paying 29% tax on the dividend. Moreover, the announcement to do away with 70 types of income tax exemption too can lead to rise in income tax liability, but exact implications will be ascertained only when exact details about the exemptions withdrawn emerges,” Pahwa said.

Pankaj Munjal, chairman-cum-managing director, Hero Cycles Limited, said, “The central government’s decision to allocate 4,400 crores for tackling pollution in cities with a population of over a million is a progressive move, which is in line with the commitment India had made to honour the climate change agreement in Paris.”

“Clean energy and transport must be the focal point, and the FM has already announced measures to boost the latter with the decision to provide funds to set up grid connected solar pumps and turn fallow and barren lands into power generation sites,” Munjal added.

“The government must incentivise e-vehicle manufacturers, and funnel a portion of the Rs 1.7 lakh crore earmarked for boosting transport infrastructure to make e-bike friendly roads and parking spaces to reduce congestion in the urban areas, and promote environment friendly transportation. Heavy taxation on raw materials for e-vehicles is still a cause for concern and we expect the government to reduce the GST rate so that EV manufacturers are encouraged to set up battery manufacturing units in the country,” Hero Cycle CMD said.

Komal Kumar Jain, chairman of Duke Fashions, said, “It is a normal budget. There was nothing for any sector of industry. Though we are happy that steps have been taken for farmers, under-privileged, middle class and others. I wonder how Union finance minister Nirmala Seetharaman has claimed that the country will be able to achieve 10% GDP growth. I wish that it becomes a reality soon.”

“The announcements in terms of upgrade of infrastructure like creation of more airports, boosting the railways, setting up more power plants etc should be appreciated provided all of them materialise soon,” Jain said.

Photoquotes: Mixed response

“There was nothing big in the budget. And there were no direct relief for any industrial sector this time. Though there was a mention of changes in the drawback scheme for exporters and introduction of new benefits, as of now there is no clarity about the same. I wonder how the FM chose to ignore the important sectors like textile in the budget”

Jawahar Lal Oswal | chairman-cum-managing director, nahar group of companies

“I think this was a positive and growth-oriented budget. For me, the biggest highlight was acceptance of our demand of refund of state taxes on exports. This step will make exports more competitive. Reducing the income tax slabs is also an appreciable step. I think scrapping DDT too will prove to be beneficial for large industries

Facing serious infrastructure blues in the absence of adequate funds from the government for the past several years, a Dholewal-based government primary school is likely to witness a change in its fortunes soon as a school alumnus along with a US-based NRI and others have decided to pitch in for the purpose.

The school has just six rooms for its 462 students. One of these rooms was a head teacher’s office, but was converted into a classroom to adjust students, especially in the winters. While 63 students of Class I study in one room, 73 Class II students are accommodated in another room. Third room dedicated for Class III has 68 students. The situation is worse for students studying in Class IV, V and pre-primary classes as 81, 89 and 88 students, respectively, are accommodated in three rooms.

The school has inadequate furniture too, that leaves several students to sit on the floor.

Harpreet Kaur, head teacher, GPS Dholewal, Ludhiana 1 block, said, “There is only one office and six classrooms in total. There is no staff room for teachers. We have not received any grant for the classrooms so far. We got grant just for regular repair of the school building.”

“In case we get support, we can repair the existing rooms, windows, install water filters, flooring and construct new toilets and classrooms. A better infrastructure will help us admit more students in the school,” she added.

Taraki Lal Thapar, a member of Dholewal Welfare society, and 1959-batch passout of this school, NRI Gurinderjeet Singh and representatives of some NGOs visited the school recently.

Thapar said, “We have decided to give the school a facelift.” Gurinderjeet Singh said, “We will start repair of windowpanes soon to give students some relief from the chill.”

Teachers said every class has two sections, but both sections have to be clubbed together due to lack of room. On days, when teacher of a particular section feels the need, the classes are held in the verandah. Teachers claimed that though people want to help the school by donating desks, but they back out as the school lacks adequate space for the same in the absence of classrooms.

The school has three washrooms, one each for male students, female students and staff.

Teachers have used polythene on windows to stop chilly winds and utilised the racks to put books in classes in the absence of a library.

Chandigarh/Rohtak: While Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and other BJP functionaries were all praise for the Union Budget, opposition leaders termed it hollow.

Leader of opposition in assembly Bhupinder Hooda said the Budget was lacklustre for agriculture and economy. “Inflation, unemployment and are at all time high. As expected there was nothing new or visible for the farmers, poor or entrepreneurs. Income tax restructuring too is confusing,” he said.

The former chief minister said, “Real picture will come out when complete budget document is decoded. Just for an example, the restructuring of income tax slabs and withdrawal of exemptions is the first thing, which will confuse a taxpayer.”

Talking to mediapersons at his house in Rohtak, Hooda said that it was an ironic situation when the Union government talks of doubling the farmers income by 2022, but does not offer anything substantial for the farming community in the Budget.

“It not only lacks roadmap for future, but also has failed to address the serious concerns like unemployment, distress on farmers and middle class battling with rising inflation,” he said. Mocking the BJP government at the Centre, Hooda added that just by installing solar pumps, the income of farmers can not be doubled, it requires implementation of recommendations of M S Swaminathan Commission.

Taking about his successor, Hooda said that Khattar was scheduled to come in Rohtak on Sunday and he owed people a report card of last 100 days’ performance of his government.

Meanwhile, Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja said that budget had disappointed people of Haryana and rest of the country. “The BJP government has discriminated against with Haryana in this budget. BJP is taking revenge as it won only 40 seats in the assembly elections in the state,” she added.

Former Punjab minister Daljit Singh Cheema

CHANDIGARH: The SAD on Saturday condemned the Punjab government for proposing to start home delivery of liquor in Mohali, saying that the government was running away from its promise of ‘ghar-ghar rozgar’ (employment in every house) and now offering ‘ghar-ghar sharab’ (alcohol in every house).

SAD spokesperson and former Punjab minister Daljit Singh Cheema termed the proposal as shameful and unmindful of the sentiments of people. The proposal was mooted by the state government on Friday, in its excise policy for the year 2020-21. The government wants to implement the plan as a pilot project in Mohali in the first phase.

“A probe must be ordered into this disgusting episode as it goes against the spirit of the Constitution, whose Section 47 states that the state shall work towards prohibiting intoxicants. Here, we have a state which is not only encouraging consumption, but has turned this into a state policy by getting into the business of home delivery of liquor,” said Cheema.

He added the Congress government now wanted unemployed youth to drown their sorrows by ordering liquor online which would not only increase alcoholism among youth but lead to a law and order problem. SAD leader demanded action against officials who wanted to implement this proposal which was bound to cause hurt to the sentiments of people and causing social unrest.

BATHINDA: Noted Punjabi novelist Jaswant Singh Kanwal, 100, died at his house in Dhudike village of Moga district on Saturday morning. He collapsed in the arms of his son Sarbjit, who was buttoning up his shirt after giving him a bath. He was cremated at the village cremation ground later in the afternoon.

Kanwal left studies even before completing his matriculation, but that did not stop him from becoming one of the most celebrated writers in Punjabi. Born on June 27, 1919, months after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre , he wrote fearlessly on Punjab’s social and political issues despite facing a lot of criticism due to his radical opinions on certain issues. His 100th birthday was celebrated on a big scale at Dhudike from June 26 to 30, 2019 and was attended by scores of littérateurs, writers and academicians.

“Jaswant Kanwal was the shining star of Punjabi literature. His contribution in enriching the Punjabi culture is immense. He was the hero of people, especially the rural folk, as many of his works revolved around rural life even though he wrote about many aspects of Punjab. He was worried about Punjab and Punjabiat till his last and in his demise we have lost an icon and an era has ended,” said noted poet Surjit Patar.

Sahitya Akademy awardee Baldev Sadaknama said, “Kanwal is one of the rare writers who are well-connected to roots. He had left studies at the tender age, which is considered a pre-condition to be a good writer, but he proved that writing does not necessarily come from education.”

Kanwal kept himself engaged with whatever happened in Punjab — writing about the struggles of landless farmers in the early 1940s, naxalite movement in the 1960-70s, the militancy era in Punjab. He even wrote an open letter to then Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal to raise various issues confronting the state, including the depleting water table. He came close to Manpreet Singh Badal briefly, when he floated the Peoples Party of Punjab after resigning from the Badal government in 2010. However, it did not last long.

His novel, Lahu Di Lau (Dawn of the Blood), which is based on the naxalite movement in Punjab, is his most famous and controversial. He had to struggle to get this novel published as no publisher here would do it. He had to get it published from Malaysia in the 1970s and was smuggled to Punjab during the Emergency. After some years, the Rajiv Gandhi government had slapped a case against him for questioning the wisdom of the government in one of his writings.

“Jaswant Kanwal lived on his own terms, without bowing before anyone and never cared for the governments while writing the truth (in his works). We have lost doyen of literature in him,” said Punjabi writer Gurbhajan Singh Gill.

“He gave a new meaning and thought to the rural Punjabi populace, as they remained an integral part of his writings and he invented an appropriate rural diction for novel. He was most fascinated by people and layers of readership born in Punjabi are just because of his writing skills,” his grandson Sumail Singh Sidhu, a former Delhi University professor, said.

Kanwal wrote his first romantic work ‘Sach Nu Phansi’ in 1945 and went on to write over 70 books, including 35 novels. His works ‘Lahu Di Lau’, ‘Sach Nu Phansi’, ‘Raat Baki Hai’, ‘Roop Dhara’ and ‘Toshali Di Hanso’ are highly acclaimed. “He got the Sahitya Akademy Award in 1997 for ‘Toshali Di Hanso’,” said Sarbjit. In 2008, the Guru Nanak Deve University conferred him the degree of doctor of literature (Honoris Causa) for his contribution to Punjabi literature.

Kanwal is survived by son Sarabjit and daughters Amarjit Kaur, Charanjit Kaur, Kanwaljit Kaur and Rupinderjit Kaur.

2 Sahitya Akademi awardees gone in 2 days

It is a coincidence that two Sahitya Akademi awardees died in two days, almost a decade after it happened earlier. Kanwal died on Saturday, a day after writer Dalip Kaur Tiwana (84) did in Mohali after a brief illness. Ten years ago, two Sahitya Akademi Award winners — Ram Sarup Ankhi (78) and Harinder Singh Mehboob (70) — had died on February 14, 2010. Only a few days before that, Sahitya Akademi Award winner writer Santokh Singh Dhir had died on February 8, 2010.

Ankhi had won Sahitya Akademi award for his novel ‘Kothe Kharak Singh’ in 1987, Mehboob won it for his poetry book ‘Jhana Di Raat’ in 1991, while Dhir got it for his book on collection of short stories ‘Pakhi’ in 1996. Tiwana had won the Sahitya Akademi award in 1971 for her book ‘Eho Hamara Jiwana’.

471,['2/02/2020'],Municipal corporation gets 27 new sewerage cleaning machines for Rs 2.5 crore,"This story is from February 2, 2020

LUDHIANA: In order to improve sewerage cleaning work in the city, civic officials finally got new machines on Saturday. Officials now claim sewermen need not enter manholes for manual cleaning. Even for Buddha Nullah’s regular cleaning, one poclain machine is being purchased under the Smart City Mission funds. Officials claimed the new machines were required to provide better services to the public, because in winter, sewerage cleaning becomes a tough task, and most of the time, sewerage choking creates problems for the general public.

The civic body has received 32 new sewerage cleaning machines (8 big ones and 24 small ones) at a cost of Rs2.5 crore under the Smart City Mission, because the MC does not have funds for such works. The machines will now start cleaning sewerage in various parts of the city. In the absence of machinery, the sewermen used to enter manholes even without safety kits, and several incidents had taken place in the past when sewermen lost their lives or fell unconscious while cleaning the lines.

One of the sewermen claimed there were clear directions from the Supreme Court that manual sewerage cleaning was not allowed, and in case under some circumstances they need to go inside, then it should be done carefully by taking all precautions. He said many fatal incidents happened in the past, and every time civic officials blamed shortage of funds. He hoped they would now get rid of manual cleaning. Superintending engineer of Operation and Maintenance cell Rajinder Singh said they had got the machines, and in this lot, they had received 24 small machines to clear choking in narrow lanes and within residential areas.

Meanwhile, MC had proposed to purchase two poclain machines for regular sewerage cleaning, because at present, the civic body is dependent on the drainage department for its cleaning, which takes place before every monsoon season. However, senior officials in Chandigarh have given approval for purchasing only a single machine, and after seeing the results, the officials can go ahead with second machine.

472,['2/02/2020'],Ludhiana residents offer mixed views on Budget,"This story is from February 2, 2020

LUDHIANA: While the Budget announced on Saturday failed to live up to the expectations and demands of the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), reduction in income tax slabs and other announcements by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to encourage manufacturing and automatic refund of export duties are being welcomed by city businessmen.

One of the major announcements that is being especially hailed by the business community is making stricter rules for certificate of origin in case of import of goods that, according to them, is going to tighten noose on the easy and free flows of cheap Chinese imports. The decision to bring schemes for settlement of income tax disputes is too being cheered by the businessmen.

Speaking to TOI, president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU) Upkar Singh Ahuja said, “If we talk of any kind of direct relief for MSME sector, there are none except for the reduction in income tax rates, but otherwise it is a well-prepared Budget and all announcements, if implemented timely, will eventually end up in boosting the growth of MSME sector. I think the most important step in this Budget that is aimed at ease of doing business is the automatic refund of export duties. Once into effect, it will make doing exports easier and cut off hectic time taken to process refund of duties. We are also hopeful that earmarking the funds for technology upgradation of automotive and pharma sector will give a big push to both sectors. However in totality, the decisions taken by the finance minister are likely to bring back the demand of goods and services back in the market.”

According to leading exporter and president of Focal Point Association Rajnish Ahuja, “This is a very good Budget. Though the finance minister could not fulfil 100% expectations of everyone, at least she has touched upon all sectors. Her statement about 10% GDP should not be taken as a mere statement. It will in fact be accomplished as earmarking of Rs 98,300 crore for the education sector and fund allocation for health sector will definitely lead to meeting this target. As far as industry is concerned, I think the biggest move made in this Budget is the efforts to put full stop on the entry of cheap Chinese goods into the Indian markets through duty-free trade routes by making guidelines regarding certificate of origin more strict and also hiking custom duty on 14 items that are mostly of Chinese origin. Besides this, the decision to bring out one-time settlement scheme for income tax disputes is remarkable as now we will be able to settle our years-old income tax cases as by just paying principal amount the case can be closed and penalties and interest waived off. I think all factors combined will have a very good impact on the growth of industry.”

General secretary of CICU Pankaj Sharma said, “The government has tried to do its best in this Budget by touching upon all sectors like manufacturing, farmimg and education. Reducing income tax slabs is a very bold step and will lead to huge savings for the businessmen falling in the eligible tax brackets. Easing norms for setting up and operations of non banking financial companies (NBFC) will lead to easy and more availability of credit for MSME sector in the market. The increase in the audit limit by five times to Rs 5 crore will act as a big booster for the MSMEs as earlier those having turnover above Rs 1 crore were subjected to audit that was not only time consuming, but also expensive.”

BATHINDA: The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) has termed the Budget presented by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman as anti-farmer and pro-corporate.

AIKSCCC, a conglomerate of over 200 farm organisations, came down heavily on the PM Narendra Modi government for its proposals and asserted the document as “highly disappointing”. “This is clearly a budget that has no space for farmers of this country. The Modi government has yet again made it clear that it is not for farmers, but for the corporate world, which matters to this government,” said AIKSCC in a press release issued after Sitharaman’s Budget speech.

AIKSCC has called for a nationwide protest on February 13 against proposals in the Budget and failure to address problems of rising farm debt, rising cost of agricultural inputs and failure to secure profitable sale of crops. “Budget proposes increased penetration of MNCs and corporate giants in supply of agriculture inputs, procurement of crops, storage, agri-processing, insurance and marketing of crops. It gives no relief to peasants from high input costs, low crop prices, distress sale, crop losses. The exploitation of farmers by companies will increase through leasing of their land, indebting them, buying their crops cheap and earning huge profits in food processing and marketing,” said AIKSCC working group members Darshan Pal and Jagmohan Singh .

474,['2/02/2020'],Eco norms: Death knell for Punjab plant,"This story is from February 2, 2020

BATHINDA: Union finance minister approved the death knell for Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant in Bathinda by proposing to close down plants whose emission is above the pre set norms and use land for alternative means. Punjab government has already started process to dismantling of the plant.

“There are yet, thermal power plants that are old and their carbon emission levels are high. For such power plants, we propose that utilities running them be advised to close them, if their emission is above the pre-set norms. The land so vacated can be put to alternative use,” said Sitharaman in her budget speech.

The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), which controls the power plants in public sector in the state, had invited global expression of interest for dismantling and disposing of the two units of 220 MW. However, as only one firm evinced interest, the authorities have now invited global tenders for all the four units of the thermal plant on “as is where is basis”.

The GNDTP has four units, which were built at a cost of Rs 115 crore between 1974 and 1979. Later, Rs 694 crore was spent on the renovation and modernisation of two units (2012-2014). “The plant has over 2,000 acre land, of which nearly 1,000 acre has been used for power plant and lakes. After disposing of the plant, the state government want to commercially exploit a part of the land. We strongly object to it as many jobs, directly or indirectly, will be lost and many employees will have to go to other places,” said thermal plant workers’ union president Gursewak Singh.

However, the decision has been hailed by environmentalists. “It is a wise step, to dismantle a coal-fired plant which causes lot of pollution. These plants are being phased out across the globe and we need power generation from renewable sources,” said an activist.

GNDTP chief engineer-cum-general manager Harcharan Dass Goyal confirmed that “all four units are being disposed and global expression of interest have been invited”.

LUDHIANA: Railway budget announced by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday has evoked mixed the response from city residents as no new train passing through the city has been announced even as the minister promised modernization of stations and trains, including increasing safety standards to curb rail accidents

While Ludhiana residents are happy over the decision of the finance minister to ply 1,150 trains on public-private partnership (PPP) mode and redevelopment of four stations with the help of private sector that will have wi-fi, CCTV cameras on all major long-route trains to ensure safety of the passengers , some were upset with no announcement being made by the railway minister about new trains.

Rakesh Kumar, a businessman from BRS Nagar who frequently travels to Delhi, said, “The decision of not plying more trains in the northern railway route has disappointed us little, but steps towards the betterment of the passengers, including of pitching more Tejas Express and connecting the same with tourist destinations, is a promising one.”

The FM also proposed to set up large solar power capacity alongside rail tracks, on land owned by Railways. While Ludhiana residents have hailed this announcement, many are upset over the decision to upgrade only four stations in the country as model railway stations with the help of private public partnership as, according to them, there is a need to upgrade several hundred stations, including Ludhiana. “At Ludhiana railway station there is an urgent need to get advance facilities from large strength waiting rooms to well-maintained bathrooms,” local resident Ankit Kapoor said.

“Railway crossing across Ludhiana and Ferozepur division would be soon digitalised as the railway budget has cleared air over this and soon it will be implemented so that railway accidents come down to some extent,” Kapoor added.

The decision to have wi-fi at all major stations is most hailed by the youngsters as during travelling they will remain connected online and find several mode of entertainment.

“While it is compulsory for the public places to have ramps for the specially abled, Ludhiana railway station does not have any such facility mainly at the rear from where most passengers enter the station . However, such ramps would soon come up the railway stations at the earliest as the same has been announced in the Budget. This includes Ludhiana as well,” said Sanjeev Sharma , a shopkeeper in Old City area.

Many resident have also claimed that some of the key decisions taken by the finance minister in the last Budget were yet to be finalized like redeveloping 600 major stations into modern ones and installing high-tech security measure across station premises to ensure safety of women passengers.

LUDHIANA: The police have found out that an inter-state gang was behind the Ghumar Mandi robbery and are trying to trace the link of a local informer who had passed on the information on the jewellery godown to the gang.

During investigation, cops have found that not even nearby shopkeepers were aware of any such godown in the market.

On Wednesday, four armed robbers had barged into the jewelery godown in busy Ghumar Mandi market and escaped with 2kg gold jewellery after taking the owner and worker at gunpoint. Two accused were also captured in the CCTV camera and city police had also announced Rs 1 Lakh rewards to informer.

Additional deputy commissioner of police (detective) Dayama Harish Kumar said an inter-state gang is behind this robbery. During investigation, the police have identified that most of the nearby shopkeepers were not aware of the jewellery godown in the market. It is suspected that the gang must have their local informer who had passed on the information.

The official said the police teams are on the job to track down the accused.

On asking if role of owners is also suspected, the officials said that nothing such has been found so far.

The ADCP said another robbery of gold jewellery had been executed in Phagwara too and the police are getting details of that incident too.

Talking about the security of such godowns, the ADCP said, “Once the case is solved, the police will conduct a meeting with the jeweller associations to ensure they have security guards. Besides, they should also have DVRs of CCTV at some other place as accused take away the CCTV recorder before fleeing.”

Box: Two major incidents in a week, despite CCTVs no breakthrough

On January 23, wanted criminal Sukhwinder Singh Moni along with his unidentified accomplice shot dead Harjinder Jindi in busy Jawahar Nagar market. In that case too, police got CCTV recording of the accused, but failed to get any clue on them. Moni was already wanted by Ludhiana police in the Rs 23-Lakh ATM robbery case executed in November 2019. Despite that, the accused managed to visit his own locality and execute a murder.

On January 29, four armed robbers robbed jeweller Vinay Jain in busy Ghumar Mandi market in broad daylight. In this case too, the police got picture of two suspects, captured on a CCTV camera, however the cops are yet to identify them.

Shimla: On expected lines, BJP leaders in Himachal Pradesh hailed the Union Budget, while opposition parties flayed it.

With no specific announcement made for Himachal Pradesh in the Union Budget, the Congress has criticised the Budget presented in Lok Sabha on Saturday. Congress’s former chief minister Virbhadra Singh said the Budget had disappointed people of state who had pinned hopes from it, while CPM said that the proposals had further betrayed the people of Himachal Pradesh.

On the other hand, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur called the Budget “historic document” that revolved around three ideas of ‘aspirational India’, ‘economic development’ and ‘caring society’. He claimed the allocation for Himachal Pradesh had been raised by 33%, which would accelerate the pace of development.

Virbhadra said that budget would not help to bring the derailed economy back on track. For small hill state like Himachal Pradesh, there was no encouragement for development in the Budget. He said the Budget was not in national interest as public sector undertakings were completely ignored, while capitalists encouraged. He also called the proposal directionless.

The state committee of CPM said the Budget only attempted to address the concerns of finance and corporate capital. CPM MLA Rakesh Singha said that Union Budget was a betrayal despite Union minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Thakur belonging to state. He said some special schemes related to tourism , infrastructure development, expansion of railways, development of airports and horticulture could have easily appeared in the Budget proposals, especially when the BJP had got the highest percentage of votes from Himachal Pradesh in the last Lok Sabha election.

The CM said Union Budget was aimed to address hopes and aspirations of all the sections of the society. The proposal of 16 actionable plans to enhance the income of the farmers would especially benefit Himachal as 90% population lived in rural areas with agriculture as their main avocation, he added. The ambitious plans would not only ensure the upliftment of rural areas but also ensure socio-economic development of farmers, unemployed youth and common man, he claimed.

He said that budget was an attempt to ensure faith of masses by winning their confidence by way of all round development. He hailed the proposal for constitution of ‘Investment Clearance Cell’ at state level. He said this would give a flip to endeavour of the state to attract more investments as the state government had already signed MoUs worth Rs 1 lakh crore with various investors.

The state would also be immensely benefited by allocation of Rs 6,000 crore for BharatNet programme under which one lakh gram panchayats of the country would be linked with optical cable fibre for internet connectivity this year, he added.

The CM said budget allocation of Rs 45,000 crore for tourism sector would also prove a boon to tourism industry in the country. He said as Himachal Pradesh had already launched various schemes to develop virgin and unexplored places as major tourist destinations, the Union government’s steps would give a big boost to the state.

CHANDIGARH: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday hailed the Union Budget as a visionary, pro-poor and future-ready budget.

Referring to the announcement of Rakhigarhi village in Hisar district to be developed as an iconic archaeological site with an on-site museum, the chief minister said that it was a matter of pride that now Rakhigarhi would be recognized internationally.

He said that this decision would not only place Rakhigarhi on the world map but also increase the revenue of the state as it would be developed as a tourist destination. Employment opportunities would also be created for the youth of the village, he added.

Khattar said special focus on farming, MSMEs and social welfare sectors would in particular help improve the lives of people of Haryana. He said that the significant budgetary allocations and announcements for promotion of good governance and ease of living, including the 16 point plan for farmers, relief to taxpayers and extension of Ayushman Bharat scheme would have great synergies with the ongoing and planned efforts of the state government in these important areas.

Congratulating Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for presenting a pro-poor, pro-farmers and pro-common man budget, the chief minister expresses confidence that the budget would boost the country’s socio-economic development and also give a decisive upward push to the economic growth. He highlighted the importance of raising the turnover threshold for audit of MSMEs from Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crore in this regard.

PM Modi (file photo)

NEW DELHI: The Budget presents a strong vision as well as action by way of new reforms to speed up the economy and lay a firm foundation for the development of modern India in the new decade, PM Narendra Modi said on Saturday.

The PM said the objective of the Budget was to strengthen every citizen economically. “Employment is mainly generated in agriculture, infrastructure , textiles and technology... there is a boost for employment generation in these areas. There is an effort to double farm incomes with 16 action points,” he added.

Modi said there was an integrated approach to agriculture with traditional practices being supported along with horticulture, fisheries and animal husbandry.

Home minister Amit Shah said the Budget offered Rs 85,000 crore for schemes and measures for Scheduled Castes and other disadvantages sections while there was Rs 57,000 crore for Scheduled Tribes . “The water mission is an important addition to housing, electricity, toilets and cooking gas programmes already rolled out by the government ,” he said.

“In this Budget, the Modi government has taken effective steps to rationalise the tax system, boost basic infrastructure, strengthen the banking system, promote investment and ease of doing business,” Shah said. There was unprecedented relief for income tax payers of every category, particularly the middle class, he said, adding that salaried taxpayers would not only see their tax reduced but would get relief from simplification of the tax system.

The PM said the duty structure had been reformed and the Ayushman Bharat programme had given a major boost to the health sector. “The connection between technology and employment has been recognised. The necessary policy support for quantum computing has been given. India is being made a bigger part of the global value chain,” he said.

Initiatives have been launched aimed at developing skill sets needed in modern India with degree courses in entrepreneurship and internships in local government, the PM said. “There is an ambitious plan to develop export potential in districts. Modern India needs modern infrastructure. The Rs 1 lakh crore for 6,500 projects will spur business and trade. Tourism needs infrastructure and it can generate employment with lesser investment,” he added.“There are basic changes in the tax structure, there is investment for employment and historic steps have been taken like in the bond markets and removal of DDT. Companies will get Rs 25,000 crore for investment. All these decisions are intended to create more jobs for youth,” the PM said.

After cancelling two proposed visits to Assam since mid-December, PM Narendra Modi will be reaching the state next Friday for a public rally organised in Kokrajhar in celebration of the tripartite Bodo Accord signed on January 27, minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday.

“The PM’s arrival here on February 7 is confirmed,” Sarma said, adding that home minister Amit Shah was likely to accompany him to the rally.

The 3rd Khelo India Youth Games from January 10 was to be inaugurated by PM Modi , but the visit was cancelled a few days before the event. Earlier, he was to host his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, at a summit scheduled for December 15 and 16 in Guwahati. The summit was “postponed” in the wake of arson and vandalism on the streets during protests against the new citizenship law.

For BJP, Modi’s scheduled visit to Kokrajhar is seen as holding additional significance because of the Bodo council elections in April. “Polls will be held to fill the existing 40 seats. The expansion of the council to 60 seats will take at least another six months. We do not want to keep the poll process waiting till then,” Sarma said.

Nirmala Sitharaman (file photo)

The use of poetry was hardly unusual. After all, all finance ministers have done so, from Manmohan Singh, P Chidambaram to Arun Jaitley.

But Nirmala Sitharaman’s choice had a political right to it. She read out a verse in Kashmiri, with a few voices from the opposition immediately shouting about the region’s lockdown. They had not heard the finance minister fully, as she translated a key sentence about the lotus blooming in the Dal lake.

Sitharaman chose Dinanath Koul’s evocative poem, Myon Vatan. Koul, who used the pen name Nadim, was a Sahitya Akademi recipient. “Our country is like Shalimar Bagh, our country is like the lotus in the Dal Lake, our country is like the warm blood of the youth, my country, your country, our country, the most adorable country in the world.”

At a time when Jammu and Kashmir has been denuded of its special status, the poem was redolent with political meaning. And the lotus simile brought smiles on the faces of the BJP leaders as the opposition fell silent. Manmohan Singh, who had a flair for Urdu poetry, cited Allama Iqbal and Muzaffar Razmi Kairanvi . P Chidambaram regularly referred to ancient Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar, as did Sitharaman incidentally. Yashwant Sinha and Arun Jaitley also freely quoted verse.

The sunny yellow silk sari complemented Sitharaman’s allusion to the bouquet of flowers that comprised the three broad themes of the Budget — Aspirational India, economic development and Caring India.

Dressed in tune with the festive spirit of Basant Panchami, Sitharaman went on for long without a sip of water, a decision that left her feeling dehydrated. With two pages to go, she said the speech be considered tabled.

The FM balanced politics and fiscal policies, while the opposition protested against Sitharaman’s claim of government’s commitment to “happiness, safety and security” of every Indian, disrupting her address with reference to MoS finance Anurag Thakur ’s controversial “goli maaro” speech.

Loud protests, led by Trinamool MP Kalyan Banerjee who is blessed with strong lung power, erupted when the FM announced the government decision to disinvest a part of its stake in Life Insurance Corporation.

Sitharaman tapped into a couple of more poets. Classical Sanskrit poet Kalidas was quoted to convey how a just and generous ruler collects drops and gives back copiously. “They collect only for people’s wellbeing” said the ancient work Raghuvamsa. She also dipped into Tamil woman saint poet Aauvaiyar to quote “BhumitiruthiUnn” — “first tend to till one's land and then eat”.

Tulsidas, Amir Khusro , Rabindranath Tagore, Bharathiyar, Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, Mirza Ghalib, Rahat Indori, Bashir Badr and Dushyant Kumar were all heard in Lok Sabha in the winter and budget sessions in 2019.

485,['2/02/2020'],rajasthan: Who is the animal?,"More often than not, when the discussion surrounding animal cruelty comes up it is regarding the animals being tested or experimented upon in various labs (in the name of science, research, product development etc.). A study conducted by PETA concluded that, each year more than 100 million animals are subjected to such cruelty in the United States alone. This provides a rough estimate of the worldwide use of different animals for conducting various experiments. Indian government has banned testing and experimentation that is carried out on animals in the cosmetic, and pharmaceutical world. However, that by no means reflects the cruelty that animals in the county are still being subjected to.It has become increasingly difficult not to raise concerns about the plightful state of animals. As a student, I only have so much authority when my residential community unanimously decides it to be fair to discuss the possible relocation of the animals that I have grown up with. Not only have I seen litters of puppies being poisoned season after season, but I have also faced the rationalization thrown in my face that comes along with it. I do not have many tools at my disposal when it comes to implementing a wide-scale change in morality and mindset but what I do have is the power to educate the people willing to listen and to look after helpless voices.Growing up in an ordinary north Indian setting, I have seen the rapid decline in the population of stray cats and dogs along with almost a disappearance in the population of many other animals such as lizards, snakes, monkeys and various species of birds. Whatever the cause may be—pollution, lack of food and shelter, culling by humans etc. the root of the abuses faced by these animals can very easily be traced back to us, people. If the cost of development, is the very lives of the creatures in the area, then perhaps we ought to reevaluate whether we want the type of change that deters living rather than making it easy for all.Animals are also subjected to intense cruelty in the name of sports, leisure and entertainment. Rarely does our mind think twice before getting on a camel on some family vacation to Rajasthan because of how the experience of being a tourist in that state feels incomplete without being carried atop a native animal. Never once does glorification of these joy rides seem harmful or wrong just because of how majestic we look while riding the 'ship of the desert'. From a very early age, we are exposed to situations where not only are we scared as children but also forced by elders around us to get on an elephant or a horse. No matter how wrong or frightful it might seem to our instincts, we are conditioned into believing that our place on top of the food chain allows us to tame and use those below us however we may please. Repeatedly studies have shown the pain that animals in captivity go through. They are beaten by sticks, poked by knives, saddled with blinders; have metal bolted onto their hooves just so their services can be made more comfortable for us. They are forced out of their natural habitat and into a dangerous commercial world where their very lives are commodified and soldIs it even fair to call the animals outside my house stray when they too have taken birth and lived their lives in the same locality as me? Is it also fair to alter their reproductive systems to put those around them at ease? A part of me wants to justify it by saying streets are no home for an animal but another part of me knows that if people start doing the bare minimum to feed them and look after their needs, they too will start feeling secure in their surroundings. It is our fundamental duty as citizens to have empathy for all living creatures around us, then why do we feel threatened by their very presence? Understand that as I raise some questions I do not come from a place of anger, rather from one full of sadness as I feel in some way, we as humans have failed the voiceless beings and have led to the rapid decline in their population. We ought to introduce more education regarding the injustices faced by animals in our country to truly begin a long due change in mindsets and start a transformative journey in their lives. Cruelty is not only limited to corporations and their laboratories but is also put out in the world by us when we neglect to keep the basic interests of life forms around us in our minds.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73839485,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1876917/73839485.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/relationships/soul-curry/who-is-the-animal/articleshow/73839455.cms

Epo tharum? Tharamenn paranja epo tharumenn para? Athentha ente cashinu vilayonnumille?"" from ' Punjabi House '. It has been 10 long years since the veteran actor Cochin Haneefa bid adieu to us. A decade ago, on February 2’s cold evening, Cochin Haneefa breathed his last at a private hospital in Chennai. Memories of the actor who made people laugh with his hysterically funny lines now make fans well up. Even a decade after his unfortunate demise, Mollywood hasn't accepted that he is gone. The impeccable performances in the past decades keep Cochin Haneefa alive in the hearts of his fans and colleagues.Born in 1951, Mohammed Haneefa was a great fan of drama and cinemas. He always wanted to be a performer which paved the path for Cochin Kalabhavan to be part of a comedy troupe in Kochi. Haneefa was the star performer of the troupe who could easily engage audience with his humor-filled lines. The audience laughed their lungs out to his rib-tickling dialogues. He found the smile and laughter priceless and hence enjoyed it. Smiling and making others smile was his only motto. Later on, in 1972, Haneefa fetched his debut in Mollywood with 'Azhimukham'. After entering showbiz, he adopted the name Cochin Haneef.Cochin Haneefa who began his career playing antagonist roles later shifted the focus to characters that had humour in it. His characters like Haidross from 'Chenkol', boat owner Gangadharan from 'Punjabi House', Vikraman from 'CID Moosa' still entertain the audience for their amusing nature. Not just comical roles, but Haneefa has also proved that he is great in acing character roles like Mani in 'Soothradharan'. From Jayan, Nazir, Mohanlal, Mammootty, Dileep to Prithviraj Sukumaran, the actor has worked with most of the A-listers in Mollywood.Many of Haneefa's fans know that he was an exceptional actor, but seldom do they know that Haneefa was a multifaceted talent. From penning stories for several movies to directing a bunch of great movies, Haneefa has tried his luck in filmmaking as well. Haneefa has directed Mammootty for 'Vatsalyam'. The movie portrayed the beauty of relationships. Mammootty's character Meledathu Raghavan Nair still remains in the hearts of the audience and we couldn't help but see Haneefa's autobiographical elements in it. 'Bheesmacharya' and 'Oru Sindoora Pottinte Ormaykku' are some of his other directorial works.Cochin Haneefa was a person who believed in earning beautiful relationships. From working for movies without remuneration to maintaining friendship with his colleagues, Haneefa managed to weave beautiful bonds. Haneefa maintained a great friendship with the Big M's - Mohanlal and Mammootty. He has also acted with both of them in numerous movies. Dileep, Salim Kumar, Innocent and many others were dear friends of the actor. In fact, Haneefa had absolutely zero haters!Cochin Haneefa tied the knot in 1994. He was 45 when he married 19-year-old Fasila. Although it was a late marriage, the actor got the perfect partner that he always wanted. The duo was head over heels in love with each other. The only thing Haneefa asked Fasila during their first meeting was, ""Did you like me?"" They walked hand in hand and had two kids, twins - Safa and Marva. As a great partner and companion, Fasila always stayed close to the actor. Although the span he lived with his family was short, Haneef made sure to be a great companion to his wife Fasila and a doting father to his two daughters.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73844320,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-494228/73844320.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/remembering-cochin-haneefa-on-his-10th-death-anniversary/articleshow/73844320.cms

Kolkata Municipal Corporation is making it mandatory for developers and land owners to get building plans sanc... Read More

KOLKATA: In a complete revamp of building laws in the city, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation is making it mandatory for developers and land owners to get building plans sanctioned by applying online from April 1 for a single-window clearance. A common application form (CAF) will be available on the KMC website for the purpose.

In another groundbreaking reform, from February 15, the KMC buildings department will arrange for suo motu clearance of mutation certificates online once a property (buildings/flats) is registered. The changes will cut red tape, expedite sanction of building plans and protect the interests of the buyers besides saving them from doing the rounds of the KMC headquarters.

Also from now on, developers will need to obtain a completion certificate for the newly constructed buildings before applying for an occupancy certificate. According to mayor Firhad Hakim, this change will protect the interests of buyers. These reforms are part of a key index in the World Bank’s assessment on “ease of doing business”. Swift sanction of building plans is required in Kolkata and Bengaluru if India has to improve its global ranking.

Applicants, who want to build a structure taller than 15.5 metres or with an area exceeding 500 sq metres, will benefit from this single window nod as they till now needed clearances from multiple agencies.

Large sections of KMC building rules have been amended to offer land owner or a realty developer, who wants to construct a high-rise, freedom from obtaining NOCs from multiple state agencies after submitting documents for sanction of plans with KMC buildings department. Apart from KMC’s land survey, water supply and drainage departments, the applicants earlier needed to apply for NOCs from various state agencies like fire services, KIT, KMDA and PCB among others.

Under the new system, KMC will coordinate with state agencies and sanction a building plan within 30 working days from its application, said Hakim. Earlier, the civic body would take 330 working days to do the job. “Under the new system, once the KMC buildings department receives an application through common application form, officials will ask state agencies to verify documents online. Three days will be given to agencies either to accept or reject an application. If an application is rejected, valid reasons must be cited. A joint inspection of land will be conducted by KMC officials and state agencies after an applicant is given NOC. After verification of all NOCs and drawings, KMC will issue a sanction in a month’s time,” said an official.

If the height of a building is less than 15.5 metres or the total area is less than 550 sq metres, KMC will empower a licensed building surveyor or an architect to sanction the plan.

10 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW TO CHANNEL YOUR INNER YODA

AS YOU FLY YOUR FALCON, WATCH OUT FOR THESE TAX HEADWINDS

AWAKEN THE FORCE FOR MORE MONEY IN POCKET

CLUBBING WILL ADD TO YOUR INCOME

FACELESS TAX TROOPERS TO KEEP YOU EAR-NEST

NEW DELHI: One tax regime was tricky. Now, you have an optional second one. How do you decide which one to pick? Thishelps you decode Union Budget 2020 , walking you through everything you must know that will determine the health of your bank account at the end of the year.1. A new ‘simplified’ personal income-tax regime has been introduced on income up to 15 lakh but taxpayers can opt for it only if they forego their claim for several exemptions (HRA, LTA), deductions (standard deduction, deduction for investment in PF, PPF, LIC premium) and to set off certain losses (such as loss from house property).2. Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) has been abolished and dividends will be taxed in hands of the recipient taxpayers at applicable slab rates. Further, TDS @ 10% will be applicable on dividend paid to an individual exceeding 5,000 during a fiscal. This will benefit small taxpayers who are subject to tax at lower slab rates than the applicable DDT rates.3. The FM giveth and the FM taketh away. Employer’s contribution to provident fund, National Pension System and superannuation fund exceeding in aggregate 7.5 lakh per year to be taxed as salary in hands of employee. Interest, dividend and other similar incomes arising on such excess contribution (exceeding 7.5 lakh) to be taxed as well. This will lead to additional tax liability, especially for high net worth individuals.4. Payment of tax on ESOPs received by employees of eligible startups to be deferred. Such tax is now payable on completion of five years from year of allotment of shares or sale of shares or cessation of employment, whichever is earlier. This will improve cash flow for employees. However, such benefits are only available for employees of eligible startups and not of all employers.5. Homebuyers get some relief. No adjustments to the sale consideration on transfer of immovable property can be made where variation between stamp duty value and sale consideration is not more than 10% of latter (earlier 5%). This will reduce hardship to taxpayers for genuine transactions in real estate.6. Taxpayers, please open your heart and wallets too. Details of eligible donation under Section 80G will be pre-filled in the incometax returns basis the information submitted by the donee (charitable institution). There is however, a possibility of claims being disallowed if the proper details of donations are not submitted.7. Lesser disputes better trust. ‘Vivaad se Vishwas’ Scheme to be introduced where taxpayers can pay the amount of disputed tax (no interest or penalty) on or before March 31, 2020 and settle pending disputes. Taxpayers can also pay tax under dispute by June 30, 2020 with some additional amount (expected to be lower than the penalty/interest exposure) under this scheme.8. More (information with the tax department) is better. Instead of the annual tax statement (Form 26AS) for taxpayers on the online tax portal, a more comprehensive annual financial statement which will capture multiple information such as sale / purchase of immovable property, sharebased transactions, etc in addition to details of taxes deducted at source has been prposed. This will enable taxpayers to reconcile the details reported in their tax returns with the information already available with the tax authorities, thereby reducing litigation.9. Good news for first-time homebuyers. To promote affordable housing, additional tax deduction of up to 1.5 lakh for interest on housing loan has been extended to loans sanctioned up to March 31, 2021 (earlier, March 31, 2020).10. Travelling abroad without deducting tax at source from the payment to your tour operator or making a foreign remittance under the Reserve Bank’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS)? Tour operators/banks (authorised dealers) will collect tax at source of 5% from you. If you don’t furnish your PAN/Aadhaar, the tax to be collected will increase to 10%.Payment of tax on ESOPs by startups will now be after five years from the year of allotment of shares or in the year of termination of employment or of sale, whichever is earlier. However, it will be taxable at rates for the fiscal of allotment. But, there is ambiguity on the mechanism of reporting such income in returns.DDT on dividends declared by Indian cos and MFs is abolished. However, HNIs will be taxed on dividend income from equity oriented MFs at a higher rate than beforeWith the withdrawal of DDT, cos will have to deduct TDS @10% on dividends of over 5,000 during a fiscal. So taxpayers like senior citizens, who didn’t have to file returns, will now have to do so or submit Form 15G/Form 15H to each company where they hold shares.Various tax sops, be it for your salary perks or investments that you make, help reduce your tax outgo.In certain cases, the income of the spouse or child is clubbed with that of the taxpayer who has to bear the tax. For instance:a) Income from investments in the name of a child (below 18 years). In this case, the minor’s income is clubbed with that of the parent who earns more.b) Income from investments made from the taxpayer’s funds in the spouse’s name.Be ready for an all-electronic audit of your tax return, which is a paradigm shift from the current procedure. Here are the key points that you need to know about faceless assessment.1. All notices will be issued only in electronic mode in your e-filing account on the income-tax department’s portal. You may also receive intimation on your registered email ID. Do keep personal details like email id and mobile number updated on the income tax department’s portal for timely receipt of such notices.2. Keep login credentials of your account on income tax portal handy to check on such notices and for filing timely responses.3. The response to notices and all the documents are to be filed electronically on the income tax department’s portal within 15 days of issuance of the notice.4. You should keep handy Form 16 and Form 12BA (annual withholding tax certificate) issued by the employer; monthly salary slips and proof of all expenses reimbursed by your employer.5. In addition, do ensure that documents for all deductions and exemptions claimed by you in the tax return form are readily available. These could include evidence of investments, including purchase of immovable property, copy of rent agreement, receipt of municipal tax (if you have let out your house on rent), interest certificate for home loans, details of loans/ gifts taken or received, copy of bank statements and demat account statements.6. Under the new scheme, there is no face-to-face interaction between the tax officer and the individual. The individual would not know details of the tax officer who would be conducting the audit of his/ her return.7. There is no requirement to visit the tax office. In rare cases when personal interaction is required, hearing will be conducted only through video-conferencing.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73861093,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-117397,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/union-budget-2020-decoding-old-and-new-tax-regime/articleshow/73861032.cms
490,['2/02/2020'],Union Budget 2020: Five things about home loan incentives you should know,"This story is from February 2, 2020

1. Even a loan taken from an employer, friend, private lender is eligible for deduction — but only the interest component and not the principal amount. And you’ll need a certificate from the lender.

2. Booking an apartment which is under construction is sometimes cheaper. I-T law permits you to claim the total interest paid during the pre-delivery period as a deduction in five equal instalments starting from the fiscal in which construction was completed or you acquired your apartment (generally this denotes the date of possession). Of course, the maximum you can claim as deduction per year continues to be 2 lakh in case of selfoccupied property (but, you could be eligible for the additional interest deduction, as explained).

3. It makes tax sense to purchase the new apartment jointly — say with your spouse, then each of you is entitled to a deduction of 2 lakh for interest funded by each of you, as explained above. In case you have a working son/daughter and the bank is willing to split the loan three ways, all three can avail deduction up to 2 lakh each on self- occupied property. Add to it the additional interest (if applicable for rented or deemed to be let out property), and the savings can be significant.

4. No notional rent will be added to the taxable income of your second self-occupied house property. Thus, if you don’t find a ready tenant you can keep it self-occupied. Do note, that this leeway is available only for up to two houses. A third house which is not let out will still attract tax on its ‘deemed value’. In other words, tax will be calculated at expected market rent.

5. The total loss from house property which can be adjusted with any other income (salary, other source) has been capped at 2 lakh. Further, if you are unable to set off the interest of 2 lakh against any income head, the (surplus) interest which could not be set-off can be carried forward only for eight assessment years. Additionally, such set-off is possible only against ‘income from house property’. It becomes a sunk cost if you haven’t let out your house on rent.

Shadab Farooq was shot at in the arm by a gunman during the anti-CAA protests. (ANI File Photo)

NEW DELHI: Two days after he was shot in the arm by a youth during a protest march , Jamia Millia Islamia student Shadab Farooq on Saturday accused the varsity administration of inaction following the violence on campus on December 15. The mass communication student said that the police was not solely to be blamed and the situation wouldn’t have come to this had the Jamia administration taken some action.

Narrating the sequence of events that led to his getting shot on January 30, Farooq, in a statement, said, “The Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) had called for a Gandhi March from Jamia. I was about to join the protest, waiting for the crowd to march forward, when I saw a random person holding a pistol in his hand walking towards Holy Family Hospital. I saw some of my friends standing there. I immediately ran towards the person holding the pistol to calm him down. People were asking police to stop him. They were continuously shouting that he’s holding a pistol, but police didn’t listen. Instead, they kept on recording videos. I repeatedly asked the youth to put the gun down, but he shot me on my left forearm.”

The Jamia student added, “The Jamia administration and vice-chancellor, too, should be blamed for what happened. Had they taken action against the police brutality earlier, this might not have happened. It’s the responsibility of the administration to take care of its students.”

“What happened at Jamia was a result of hyper nationalism. What I did yesterday wasn’t an act of heroism. I did what I felt was right. I’m calling for action because I’m hurt. If the administration still doesn’t take any action, tomorrow there will be another Shadab standing in front of a bullet,” Farooq said, adding that he would be back in college soon. “The fight is long, but we will fight. We will win,” he said.

Responding to Farooq’s statement, the Jamia administration said, “We have a limited role in respect to events taking place outside the campus. Law and order is the domain of police. The university has no role if things happen outside the campus.”

Here's a look at how it gives a new hope for buyers.Equated monthly instalments (EMIs) are typically divided into principal (the amount you take as loan) and interest (the cost of servicing the loan). In case you don’t opt for the new ‘simplified’ personal income tax regime, the principal is allowed as a deduction from your gross total income (subject to an overall cap under Section 80C with other eligible investments of 1.5 lakh).Interest payable on 'self-occupied' property is subject to a maximum deduction of 2 lakh under the head 'income from house property'. This deduction is not available under the new ‘simplified’ personal income tax regime.This reduces your total tax liability. But to claim this, it is essential that acquisition or construction is completed within 5 years from the end of the financial year in which the loan was taken, else the deduction will be limited to 30,000.An additional tax deduction of up to 1.5 lakh has been introduced for interest on home loan taken between April 1, 2019 and March 31, 2021, for buying a house with stamp duty value up to 45 lakh. However, you should not own any other residential property at the time of sanction of loan. If you still haven’t bought your first home, do so at the earliest. This deduction is not available under the new ‘simplified’ tax regime.If you have rented out property, the difference between rent you get after adjustment of municipal taxes, standard deduction and the entire interest on housing loan is your ‘loss from house property’ which you can set off up to 2 lakh against your other income, say salary.Loss under the head ‘house property’, can be set off against other heads of income (including salary income) in the same year if you don’t opt for the new 'simplified’ personal income tax regime.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73861324,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-59383,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/falling-property-prices-plus-tax-breaks-a-new-hope-for-buyers/articleshow/73861332.cms

NEW DELHI: A Delhi Police team has gone to Jattari village near Jewar to nab the arms dealer who had sold the pistol to the teenager who opened fire at a Jamia student on Thursday. Police are also probing the source of the money which was used to buy the pistol.

While being counselled, the teenager claimed that he got the money from his mother to buy a dress for the wedding. He told the arms dealer that he needed the weapon for the celebratory firing. The make and bore of the weapon is being analysed.

The juvenile wanted to purchase a gun and had contacted one of his friends for the same. A day before the incident of firing, the boy, along with his friend, had visited the village and purchased the gun. The friend took some commission out of the Rs 10,000 he spent on buying the weapon, the juvenile claimed. It is being verified.

The juvenile, who is housed in a shelter home, will also be studying there as his Class 12 exams are to begin in March. Apart from books, he has also asked for tuition facilities, which will be provided to him. On January 30, the boy put a gun in his bag and left Jewar in a bus. He reached Pari Chowk in Greater Noida and then boarded a bus and managed to reach the DND Flyway. The boy kept looking for autorickshaws, but they refused to ply due to traffic. He subsequently took a bus, which dropped him near Jamia. There he roamed around for a while and then went live on Facebook from his phone. Hours later, he fired.

Before leaving, he had also told his sister that she would feel proud of him.

On Thursday, a student of Jamia Millia Islamia was injured after the juvenile opened fire in Jamia area, where protests were going on against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The injured, Shadab Farooq, a student of the second semester of MA Mass Communication, had sustained injuries in his left hand.
